===Sickle cell crisis===
The terms "sickle cell crisis" or "sickling crisis" may be used to describe several independent acute conditions occurring in patients with SCD, which results in anaemia and crises that could be of many types, including the [[vaso-occlusive crisis]], [[Reticulocytopenia|aplastic crisis]], [[splenic sequestration crisis]], [[Hemolysis#Hemolytic_crisis|haemolytic crisis]], and others. Most episodes of sickle cell crises last between five and seven days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1189|title=BestBets: How long should an average sickle cell crisis last?|access-date=2010-11-27|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617031532/http://bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1189|archive-date=2010-06-17}}</ref> "Although infection, dehydration, and [[acidosis]] (all of which favor sickling) can act as triggers, in most instances, no predisposing cause is identified."<ref>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; Aster, Jon (2009-05-28).

===Vaso-occlusive crisis===
The vaso-occlusive crisis is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells that obstruct capillaries and restrict blood flow to an organ, resulting in [[ischemia|ischaemia]], [[pain]], [[necrosis]], and often organ damage. The frequency, severity, and duration of these crises vary considerably. Painful crises are treated with hydration, [[analgesic]]s, and [[blood transfusion]]; pain management requires [[opiate|opioid]] drug administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manages on [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]  such as [[diclofenac]] or [[naproxen]]. For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; [[patient-controlled analgesia]] devices are commonly used in this setting. Vaso-occlusive crisis involving organs such as the penis<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olujohungbe A, Burnett AL | title = How I manage priapism due to sickle cell disease | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 160 | issue = 6 | pages = 754–65 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23293942 | doi = 10.1111/bjh.12199 }}</ref> or lungs are considered an emergency and treated with red blood cell transfusions.

===Splenic sequestration crisis===
Because of its narrow vessels and function in clearing defective red blood cells, the [[spleen]] is frequently affected.<ref name=Anie2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Anie KA, Green J | title = Psychological therapies for sickle cell disease and pain | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 5 | pages = CD001916 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25966336 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001916.pub3 | pmc = 7063720 }}</ref> It is usually [[infarction|infarcted]] before the end of childhood in individuals suffering from sickle cell anaemia.

Splenic sequestration crises are acute, painful enlargements of the spleen, caused by intrasplenic trapping of red cells and resulting in a precipitous fall in haemoglobin levels with the potential for [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic]] shock. Sequestration crises are considered an emergency. If not treated, patients may die within 1–2 hours due to circulatory failure. Management is supportive, sometimes with blood transfusion. These crises are transient; they continue for 3–4 hours and may last for one day.<ref name="pmid19002450">{{cite journal | vauthors = Khatib R, Rabah R, Sarnaik SA | s2cid = 2547649 | title = The spleen in the sickling disorders: an update | journal = Pediatric Radiology | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–22 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19002450 | doi = 10.1007/s00247-008-1049-9 }}</ref>

===Acute chest syndrome===
[[Acute chest syndrome]] is defined by at least two of these signs or symptoms: chest pain, fever, [[pulmonary infiltrate]] or focal abnormality, respiratory symptoms, or hypoxemia.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal | vauthors = Glassberg J | title = Evidence-based management of sickle cell disease in the emergency department | journal = Emergency Medicine Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 1–20; quiz 20 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 22164362 }}</ref> It is the second-most common complication and it accounts for about 25% of deaths in patients with SCD. Most cases present with vaso-occlusive crises, and then develop acute chest syndrome.<ref name="Dessap_2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mekontso Dessap A, Leon R, Habibi A, Nzouakou R, Roudot-Thoraval F, Adnot S, Godeau B, Galacteros F, Brun-Buisson C, Brochard L, Maitre B | title = Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale during severe acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 177 | issue = 6 | pages = 646–53 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18174543 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.200710-1606OC | citeseerx = 10.1.1.504.790 }}</ref><ref name="pmid21615795">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul RN, Castro OL, Aggarwal A, Oneal PA | title = Acute chest syndrome: sickle cell disease | journal = European Journal of Haematology | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 191–207 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21615795 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01647.x }}</ref> Nevertheless, about 80% of people have vaso-occlusive crises during acute chest syndrome.

===Aplastic crisis===
[[Aplastic crisis|Aplastic crises]] are acute worsenings of the patient's baseline anaemia, producing [[pallor|pale appearance]], [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], and fatigue. This crisis is normally triggered by [[parvovirus B19]], which directly affects [[erythropoiesis|production of red blood cells]] by invading the red cell precursors and multiplying in and destroying them.<ref>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; Aster, Jon (2009-05-28). Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, Professional Edition: Expert Consult – Online (Robbins Pathology) (Kindle Location 33329). Elsevier Health. Kindle Edition.</ref> Parvovirus infection almost completely prevents red blood cell production for two to three days. In normal individuals, this is of little consequence, but the shortened red cell life of SCD patients results in an abrupt, life-threatening situation. [[Reticulocyte]] counts drop dramatically during the disease (causing [[reticulocytopenia]]), and the rapid turnover of red cells leads to the drop in haemoglobin. This crisis takes 4  to 7 days to disappear. Most patients can be managed supportively; some need blood transfusion.<ref name="pmid21585562">{{cite journal | vauthors = Slavov SN, Kashima S, Pinto AC, Covas DT | title = Human parvovirus B19: general considerations and impact on patients with sickle-cell disease and thalassemia and on blood transfusions | journal = FEMS Immunology and Medical Microbiology | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–62 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21585562 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-695X.2011.00819.x | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Haemolytic crisis===
[[Hemolysis#Hemolytic crisis|Haemolytic crises]] are acute accelerated drops in haemoglobin level. The red blood cells break down at a faster rate. This is particularly common in people with coexistent [[G6PD deficiency]].<ref name="pmid22264009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Balgir RS | title = Community expansion and gene geography of sickle cell trait and G6PD deficiency, and natural selection against malaria: experience from tribal land of India | journal = Cardiovascular & Hematological Agents in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–13 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22264009 | doi = 10.2174/187152512799201190 }}</ref> Management is supportive, sometimes with blood transfusions.<ref name="pmid22164362" />

Normally, humans have [[Hemoglobin A|haemoglobin A]], which consists of two alpha and two beta chains, [[Hemoglobin A2|haemoglobin A2]], which consists of two alpha and two delta chains, and [[Fetal hemoglobin|haemoglobin F]], consisting of two alpha and two gamma chains in their bodies.

Sickle cell conditions have an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance from parents.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sickle Cell Disease |url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/sickle-cell-disease/ |website=NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders) |access-date=10 June 2019}}</ref> The types of haemoglobin a person makes in the red blood cells depend on what haemoglobin genes are inherited from her or his parents.

When both parents have sickle cell trait, a child has a 25% chance of sickle cell disease; 25% do not carry any sickle cell alleles, and 50% have the heterozygous condition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sickle-cell-disease#diagnosis|title=sickle cell disease |website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=2016-05-07|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515204041/https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sickle-cell-disease#diagnosis|archive-date=2016-05-15}}</ref>

Sickle cell gene mutation probably arose spontaneously in different geographic areas, as suggested by restriction endonuclease analysis. These variants are known as Cameroon, Senegal, Benin, Bantu, and Saudi-Asian. Their clinical importance is because some are associated with higher HbF levels, e.g., Senegal and Saudi-Asian variants, and tend to have milder disease.<ref name="pmid7505527">{{cite journal | vauthors = Green NS, Fabry ME, Kaptue-Noche L, Nagel RL | title = Senegal haplotype is associated with higher HbF than Benin and Cameroon haplotypes in African children with sickle cell anemia | journal = American Journal of Hematology | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–6 | date = October 1993 | pmid = 7505527 | doi = 10.1002/ajh.2830440214 }}</ref>

The gene defect is a single [[nucleotide]] [[mutation]] (see [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] – SNP) (GAG [[codon]] changing to GTG) of the β-globin gene, which results in [[glutamic acid]] (E/Glu) being substituted by [[valine]] (V/Val) at position 6 (E6V substitution).<ref>{{cite journal | title= Genetic mutation | author=Suzanne Clancy | date=2008 | journal=Nature Education | volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=187 | url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genetic-mutation-441}}</ref><ref group="note">Historic numbering put this glutamic acid residue at position 6 due to skipping the [[methionine]] (M/Met) start codon in protein amino acid position numbering. Current nomenclature calls for counting the methionine as the first amino acid, resulting in the glutamic acid residue falling at position 7. Many references still refer to position 6 and both should likely be referenced for clarity.</ref> Haemoglobin S with this mutation is referred to as HbS, as opposed to the normal adult HbA. This is normally a benign mutation, causing no apparent effects on the [[Biomolecular structure#Secondary structure|secondary]], [[Biomolecular structure#Tertiary structure|tertiary]], or [[Biomolecular structure#Quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]s of haemoglobin in conditions of normal [[oxygen]] concentration. However, under low [[oxygen]] concentration, HbS [[polymerization|polymerizes]] and forms fibrous precipitates because the deoxy form of haemoglobin exposes a hydrophobic patch on the protein between the E and F helices (Phe 85, Leu 88).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wellstein A, Pitschner HF | title = Complex dose-response curves of atropine in man explained by different functions of M1- and M2-cholinoceptors | journal = Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology | volume = 338 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–27 | date = July 1988 | pmc = 3237253 | pmid = 22089617 | doi=10.1007/bf00168807}}</ref>

In people [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygous]] for HbS ([[Genetic carrier|carriers]] of sickling haemoglobin), the polymerisation problems are minor because the normal [[allele]] is able to produce half of the haemoglobin. In people [[Zygosity#Homozygous|homozygous]] for HbS, the presence of long-chain polymers of HbS distort the shape of the red blood cell from a smooth, [[doughnut]]-like shape to ragged and full of spikes, making it fragile and susceptible to breaking within [[capillary|capillaries]]. Carriers have symptoms only if they are deprived of oxygen (for example, while climbing a mountain) or while severely [[dehydration|dehydrated]].

[[File:HBB location.png|thumb|''[[HBB]]'' gene (responsible for sickle cell anaemia) is [[Locus (genetics)|located]] on the short (p) arm of [[chromosome 11]] at position 15.5.]]
The [[allele]] responsible for sickle cell anaemia can be found on the short arm of [[chromosome 11]], more specifically 11p15.5. A person who receives the defective gene from both father and mother develops the disease; a person who receives one defective and one healthy allele remains healthy, but can pass on the disease and is known as a [[Genetic carrier|carrier]] or heterozygote. Heterozygotes are still able to contract malaria, but their symptoms are generally less severe.<ref name="pmid19442502">{{cite journal | vauthors = Allison AC | title = Genetic control of resistance to human malaria | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 499–505 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19442502 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2009.04.001 }}</ref>

Due to the adaptive advantage of the heterozygote, the disease is still prevalent, especially among people with recent ancestry in malaria-stricken areas, such as [[Africa]], the [[Mediterranean]], [[India]], and the [[Middle East]].<ref name="pmid16001361">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kwiatkowski DP | title = How malaria has affected the human genome and what human genetics can teach us about malaria | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 77 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–92 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16001361 | pmc = 1224522 | doi = 10.1086/432519 }}</ref> Malaria was historically endemic to southern Europe, but it was declared eradicated in the mid-20th century, with the exception of rare sporadic cases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ponçon N, Toty C, L'Ambert G, Le Goff G, Brengues C, Schaffner F, Fontenille D | title = Biology and dynamics of potential malaria vectors in Southern France | journal = Malaria Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 18 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17313664 | pmc = 1808464 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-6-18 }}</ref>

The malaria parasite has a complex lifecycle and spends part of it in red blood cells. In a carrier, the presence of the malaria parasite causes the red blood cells with defective haemoglobin to rupture prematurely, making the ''[[Plasmodium]]'' parasite unable to reproduce. Further, the polymerization of Hb affects the ability of the parasite to digest Hb in the first place. Therefore, in areas where malaria is a problem, people's chances of survival actually increase if they carry sickle cell trait (selection for the heterozygote).

In the United States, with no endemic malaria, the prevalence of sickle cell anaemia among people of African ancestry is lower (about 0.25%) than among people in [[West Africa]] (about 4.0%) and is falling. Without endemic malaria, the sickle cell mutation is purely disadvantageous and tends to decline in the affected population by [[natural selection]], and now artificially through [[Genetic testing|prenatal genetic screening]]. However, the African American community descends from a significant admixture of several African and non-African ethnic groups and also represents the descendants of survivors of slavery and the slave trade. Thus, a degree of genetic dilution via crossbreeding with non-African people and high health-selective pressure through slavery (especially the slave trade and the frequently deadly [[Middle Passage]]) may be the most plausible explanations for the lower prevalence of sickle cell anaemia (and, possibly, other genetic diseases) among African Americans compared to West Africans. Another factor that limits the spread of sickle cell genes in North America is the relative absence of [[polygamy]]. In polygamous societies, affected males may father many children with multiple partners.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lesi FE, Bassey EE | title = Family study in sickle cell disease in Nigeria | journal = Journal of Biosocial Science | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–13 | date = July 1972 | pmid = 5041262 | doi = 10.1017/S0021932000008622 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Sicklecells.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scanning electron micrograph]] showing a mixture of red blood cells, some with round normal morphology, some with mild sickling showing elongation and bending]]
<!-- repeated Sickle-cell anaemia is caused by a [[point mutation]] in the β-globin chain of [[haemoglobin]], causing the hydrophobic amino acid [[valine]] to replace the hydrophilic amino acid [[glutamic acid]] at the sixth position. The β-globin gene is on [[chromosome 11]].<ref name="isbn1-4051-9666-1">{{cite book |author1=Lazarus, Hillard M. |author2=Schmaier, Alvin H. |title=Concise Guide to Hematology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2011 |page=18 |isbn=1-4051-9666-1}}</ref> The association of two [[wild-type]] α-globin subunits with two mutant β-globin subunits forms haemoglobin S (HbS). Under low-oxygen conditions (being at high altitude, for example), the absence of a polar amino acid at position six of the β-globin chain promotes the non-covalent polymerisation (aggregation) of haemoglobin, which distorts red blood cells into a sickle shape and decreases their elasticity. -->
The loss of red blood cell elasticity is central to the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. Normal red blood cells are quite elastic and have a biconcave disc shape, which allows the cells to deform to pass through capillaries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pathophysiology : introductory concepts and clinical perspectives|last=Capriotti, Theresa|others=Frizzell, Joan Parker|isbn=9780803615717|location=Philadelphia|oclc=900626405|year = 2016}}</ref> In sickle cell disease, low [[blood gas tension|oxygen tension]] promotes red blood cell sickling and repeated episodes of sickling damage the cell membrane and decrease the cell's elasticity. These cells fail to return to normal shape when normal oxygen tension is restored. As a consequence, these rigid blood cells are unable to deform as they pass through narrow capillaries, leading to vessel occlusion and [[ischaemia]].

The actual anaemia of the illness is caused by [[hemolysis|haemolysis]], the destruction of the red cells, because of their shape. Although the [[bone marrow]] attempts to compensate by creating new red cells, it does not match the rate of destruction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/scd_background.html |title=How Does Sickle Cell Cause Disease? |access-date=2010-11-27 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923165921/http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/scd_background.html |archive-date=2010-09-23 }}</ref> Healthy red blood cells typically function for 90–120 days, but sickled cells only last 10–20 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/778971-overview|title=Sickle Cell Anemia: eMedicine Emergency Medicine|access-date=2010-11-27|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204184829/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/778971-overview|archive-date=2010-12-04}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
In HbS, the [[complete blood count]] reveals haemoglobin levels in the range of 6–8&nbsp;g/dl with a high [[reticulocyte]] count (as the bone marrow compensates for the destruction of sickled cells by producing more red blood cells). In other forms of sickle cell disease, Hb levels tend to be higher. A [[blood film]] may show features of [[hyposplenism]] ([[Codocyte|target cells]] and [[Howell-Jolly body|Howell-Jolly bodies]]).

Sickling of the red blood cells, on a blood film, can be induced by the addition of [[sodium metabisulfite]]. The presence of sickle haemoglobin can also be demonstrated with the "sickle solubility test". A mixture of haemoglobin S (HbS) in a reducing solution (such as [[sodium dithionite]]) gives a turbid appearance, whereas normal Hb gives a clear solution.

Abnormal haemoglobin forms can be detected on [[haemoglobin electrophoresis]], a form of [[gel electrophoresis]] on which the various types of haemoglobin move at varying speeds. Sickle cell haemoglobin (HgbS) and [[haemoglobin C]] with sickling (HgbSC)—the two most common forms—can be identified from there. The diagnosis can be confirmed with [[high-performance liquid chromatography]]. [[Genetic testing]] is rarely performed, as other investigations are highly specific for HbS and HbC.<ref name="pmid10926923">{{cite journal | vauthors = Clarke GM, Higgins TN | title = Laboratory investigation of hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias: review and update | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 46 | issue = 8 Pt 2 | pages = 1284–90 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10926923 | url = http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/46/8/1284 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080320094527/http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/46/8/1284 | url-status = live | archive-date = 2008-03-20 | doi = 10.1093/clinchem/46.8.1284 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

An acute sickle cell crisis is often precipitated by infection. Therefore, a urinalysis to detect an [[occult]] urinary tract infection, and chest X-ray to look for occult pneumonia should be routinely performed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1102 |title=BestBets: Does routine urinalysis and chest radiography detect occult bacterial infection in sickle cell patients presenting to the accident and emergency department with painful crisis? |access-date=2010-11-27 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617032223/http://bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1102 |archive-date=2010-06-17 }}</ref>

People who are known carriers of the disease often undergo [[genetic counseling]] before they have children. A test to see if an unborn child has the disease takes either a blood sample from the [[fetus]] or a sample of [[amniotic fluid]]. Since taking a blood sample from a fetus has greater risks, the latter test is usually used. Neonatal screening provides not only a method of early detection for individuals with sickle cell disease, but also allows for identification of the groups of people who carry the sickle cell trait.<ref>Lee, C., Davies, S.,& Dezatoux, C.

===Malaria prevention===
[[File:Sickle Cell Anemia and its Protection Against Malaria.svg|thumb|Possible advantage of being heterozygous for sickle cell anemia disease (A) vs. normal blood cell response (B) when infected with malaria]]

The protective effect of sickle cell trait does not apply to people with sickle cell disease; in fact, they are more vulnerable to malaria, since the most common cause of painful crises in malarial countries is infection with malaria. People with sickle cell disease living in malarial countries should receive lifelong [[Malaria prophylaxis|medication for prevention]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Oniyangi|first1=Oluseyi|last2=Omari|first2=Aika Aa|date=2019|title=Malaria chemoprophylaxis in sickle cell disease|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2019|issue=11|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003489.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=31681984|pmc=6532723}}</ref>

===Vaso-occlusive crisis===
Most people with sickle cell disease have intensely painful episodes called vaso-occlusive crises. However, the frequency, severity, and duration of these crises vary tremendously. Painful crises are treated symptomatically with [[analgesic|pain medications]]; pain management requires opioid drug administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manages on [[NSAID]]s (such as [[diclofenac]] or [[naproxen]]). For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Carroll | first=C. Patrick | title=Opioid treatment for acute and chronic pain in patients with sickle cell disease | journal=Neuroscience Letters | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=714 | year=2020 | issn=0304-3940 | doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2019.134534 | page=134534}}</ref>

Extra fluids, administered either orally or intravenously, are a routine part of treatment of vaso-occlusive crises but the evidence about the most effective route, amount and type of fluid replacement remains uncertain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Okomo |first1=U |last2=Meremikwu |first2=MM |title=Fluid replacement therapy for acute episodes of pain in people with sickle cell disease. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=31 July 2017 |volume=7 |pages=CD005406 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005406.pub5 |pmid=28759112|pmc=6483538 }}</ref>

[[Crizanlizumab]], a monoclonal antibody target towards [[p-selectin]] was approved in 2019 in the United States to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crisis in those 16 years and older.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|date=2019-12-20|title=FDA approves crizanlizumab-tmca for sickle cell disease|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-crizanlizumab-tmca-sickle-cell-disease|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref>

Should the pulmonary infiltrate worsen or the oxygen requirements increase, simple [[blood transfusion]] or [[exchange transfusion]] is indicated. The latter involves the exchange of a significant portion of the person's red cell mass for normal red cells, which decreases the level of haemoglobin S in the patient's blood. However, there is currently uncertain evidence about the possible benefits or harms of blood transfusion for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dolatkhah |first1=R |last2=Dastgiri |first2=S |title=Blood transfusions for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=16 January 2020 |volume=1 |pages=CD007843 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007843.pub4 |pmid=31942751|pmc=6984655 }}</ref>

===Complications===
Sickle cell anaemia can lead to various complications, including:
{{colbegin}}
* Increased risk of severe bacterial infections is due to loss of functioning spleen tissue (and comparable to the risk of [[Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection|infections after having the spleen removed surgically]]). These infections are typically caused by encapsulated organisms such as ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''. Daily [[penicillin]] prophylaxis is the most commonly used treatment during childhood, with some haematologists continuing treatment indefinitely.  Patients benefit today from routine vaccination for ''S. pneumoniae''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kavanagh PL, Sprinz PG, Vinci SR, Bauchner H, Wang CJ | s2cid = 14524078 | title = Management of children with sickle cell disease: a comprehensive review of the literature | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 128 | issue = 6 | pages = e1552–74 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22123880 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2010-3686 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/128/6/e1552.long | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105424/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/128/6/e1552.long | url-status = live | archive-date = 2016-03-04 }}</ref>

Sickle cell disease occurs more commonly among people whose ancestors lived in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] sub-Saharan regions where malaria is or was common. Where malaria is common, carrying a single sickle cell [[allele]] (trait) confers a [[heterozygote advantage]]; humans with one of the two alleles of sickle cell disease show less severe symptoms when infected with malaria.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wellems TE, Hayton K, Fairhurst RM|date=September 2009|title=The impact of malaria parasitism: from corpuscles to communities|journal=[[The Journal of Clinical Investigation]]|volume=119|issue=9|pages=2496–505|doi=10.1172/JCI38307|pmc=2735907|pmid=19729847}}</ref>

This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.
