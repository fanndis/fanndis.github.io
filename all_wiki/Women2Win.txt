'''Women2Win''' is a mentoring and pressure group within the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] that promotes the election of more Conservative women [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MPs]] and increased involvement of Conservative women in public life.<ref name="Gill"/>

Women2Win was founded in 2005 by [[Theresa May]] (who subsequently became Prime Minister) and by [[Anne Jenkin]] (who became Baroness Jenkin of Kennington).<ref name="About W2W"/><ref name="Allan"/> In 2018, Theresa May launched Women2WinWales at the Welsh Conservative Party Conference, launching the campaign to elect the first female Welsh Conservative MP.<ref name="W2W Wales"/>

When Women2Win was founded there were 17 Conservative women MPs (9% of the parliamentary party) and by 2018 this had increased to 67 (20%);<ref name=Crosbie/> the work of Women2Win and of Theresa May in particular have been credited for contributing to this trend.<ref name="Lagan"/>
