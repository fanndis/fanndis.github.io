'''''Punk'd''''' is an American [[hidden camera]]–[[practical joke]] [[Reality television#Hidden cameras|reality]] [[television series]] that first aired on [[MTV]] in 2003. It was created by [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Jason Goldberg]], with Kutcher serving as producer and host. It bears a resemblance to both the classic hidden camera show ''[[Candid Camera]]'' and to ''[[TV Bloopers & Practical Jokes|TV's Bloopers & Practical Jokes]]'', which also featured pranks on [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Being "punk'd" referred to being the victim of such a prank. New episodes hosted by [[King Bach]] and [[DeStorm Power]] aired on [[BET]].

A new reboot of the series hosted by [[Chance the Rapper]] premiered on [[Quibi]] in 2020.<ref name="/Film-90">{{cite web |last1=Evangelista |first1=Chris |title=Quibi Offering 90-Day Free Trial For Potential Subscribers |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/quibi-free-trial/ |website=[[/Film]] |date=March 6, 2020}}</ref>

==History and format==
Originally, Ashton Kutcher and MTV were developing a program called ''Harassment'', a hidden camera show which would feature pranks on regular people. However, a January 2002 prank involving a fake dead body at the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] backfired and the couple who were targets of the prank sued Kutcher, MTV, and the hotel for $10 million.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2042466.stm|title=Couple sue over TV corpse 'prank'|publisher=BBC|date=2002-06-13|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> The concept was later retooled to involve celebrities instead. Pranks would be set at a variety of locations, public and private. The show's first prank was set at singer [[Justin Timberlake]]'s home, where he was led to believe that government agents were seizing his home and valuables because of unpaid income taxes. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine ranked the prank #3 on its list of 32 Epic Moments in Reality-TV History.<ref>Webley, Kayla. [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2063886_2063809_2063816,00.html "32 Epic Moments in Reality-TV History: 3. Punk'd: Justin Timberlake Cries"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, accessed April 8, 2011.</ref> Another involved [[Frankie Muniz]]'s special custom-made limited edition Porsche being stolen.

A frequent segment during the first two seasons was a ''Punk'd'' cast member pretending to interview celebrities at red carpet events, only to mock them instead. This segment closely copies what originated on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in the 1980s, when Stern and his writers began sending interns (most notably [[John Melendez|Stuttering John Melendez]]) to ask celebrities embarrassing questions on the red carpet.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/05/style/egos-ids-tough-to-ask-questions-are-getting-easier-to-ask.html EGOS & IDS; Tough-to-Ask Questions Are Getting Easier to Ask], ''The New York Times'', July 5, 1992, accessed May 28, 2009.</ref> During the first season then-fifteen-year-old [[Ryan Pinkston]] posed as a reporter from a children's television program, and would insult the celebrities.<ref>Soriano, Cesar G. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-07-13-pinkston_x.htm "MTV prankster Pinkston is a wee bit popular"], ''[[USA Today]]'', July 13, 2003</ref> During season two, the producers then chose a foreign interviewer accompanied by her interpreter who would then ask inane questions to the guests. Several actors, like [[Jill Wagner]], [[Masi Oka]], [[B.J. Novak]], [[Caitlyn Taylor Love]], [[Dax Shepard]], and a then-unknown [[Bill Hader]] were accomplices in the pranks.

The series finale aired on MTV on May 29, 2007 and culminated in early June with the Punk'd Awards.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/punkd-is-ashton-kutcher-really-calling-it-quits/ "Punk'd: Is Ashton Kutcher Really Calling It Quits?"], TVSeriesFinale.com, March 27, 2007</ref>

===Revival===
In October 2010, ''[[New York Magazine]]'' revealed that ''Punk'd'' was being revived with [[Justin Bieber]] replacing Kutcher as the host; however, it stated that Kutcher would remain as executive producer.<ref>[http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/10/justin_bieber_punkd.html "MTV Bringing Back Punk’d, With Host Justin Bieber"], ''[[New York Magazine]]'', October 5, 2010, accessed October 11, 2010.</ref> After a five-year hiatus, the program was revived with a March 2012 premiere. The first episode of the ninth season, featuring Bieber as a guest host, was filmed in late August 2011. On December 31, 2011, MTV confirmed that the program would be revived in 2012, and that a different celebrity guest host would be featured each episode, the guests included: [[Tyler, the Creator]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Bam Margera]], [[Hayden Panettiere]], [[Lucy Hale]], [[Nick Cannon]], [[Dax Shepard]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Heather Morris]], [[Kellan Lutz]], [[Daniel Tosh]], and [[Mac Miller]]. [[Ashton Kutcher]] made a returning appearance on an episode where he got to punk again.<ref>[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/12/31/mtvs-hit-series-punkd-the-pop-culture-phenomenon-returns-on-monday-march-19-for-an-all-new-season-featuring-bigger-laughs-and-more-shocking-surprises-from-your-favorite-stars-467501/20111231mtv01/ MTV's Hit Series "Punk'd," The Pop Culture Phenomenon, Returns on Monday, March 19, for an All-New Season, Featuring Bigger Laughs and More Shocking Surprises from Your Favorite Stars]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mtvpress.com/press/release/punkd_returns_for_all_new_season |title=MTV’S HIT SERIES "PUNK’D," THE POP CULTURE PHENOMENON, RETURNS ON MONDAY, MARCH 19, FOR AN ALL-NEW SEASON, FEATURING BIGGER LAUGHS AND MORE SHOCKING SURPRISES FROM YOUR FAVORITE STARS |access-date=2012-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117131516/http://mtvpress.com/press/release/punkd_returns_for_all_new_season |archive-date=2013-01-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===BET reboot===
On May 25, 2013, [[Katalyst Media]] stated that a tenth season was in development.<ref name="twitter.com">https://twitter.com/wearepunkd/status/338431618148622336</ref> At their 2015 upfronts, [[BET]] announced that they would be rebooting the program for their network. Although Katalyst had closed by then Goldberg returned as executive producer with a revival of the Katalyst banner without Kutcher. The reboot is tailored for the network's audience and goes behind the scenes of many pranks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://betpressroom.com/press/release/bet_networks_delivers_more_african_americans_each_week_than_any_other_cable|title=BET NETWORKS DELIVERS MORE AFRICAN AMERICANS EACH WEEK THAN ANY OTHER CABLE NETWORK|accessdate=May 1, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426183734/http://betpressroom.com/press/release/bet_networks_delivers_more_african_americans_each_week_than_any_other_cable|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref> The reboot premiered on August 18, 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/TWISTD-REAL-HUSBANDS-OF-HOLLYWOOD-and-PUNKD-Return-to-BET-This-August-20150804|title=TWIST'D, REAL HUSBANDS OF HOLLYWOOD" and PUNK'D Return to BET This August|date=August 4, 2015|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}</ref>

To promote the program, BET announced the return of ''[[BET: Uncut]]'', a block for uncut music videos, on August 11, 2015. In reality, after a revelation and introduction from new hosts, [[King Bach]] and [[DeStorm Power]], BET aired highlights from past segments of the program as well as previews for their program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bet.com/news/celebrities/2015/08/11/gotcha-bet-uncut-isn-t-coming-back-but-punk-d-is.html|title=Gotcha!

===Quibi reboot===
In 2020, it was announced that a new Punk'd reboot would air on the mobile video platform [[Quibi]] hosted by [[Chance the Rapper]].<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/8548908/chance-the-rapper-host-mtv-quibi-punkd</ref> Since Quibi has announced that the service will be shutting down in December 2020, it is currently unknown whether the reboot will be cancelled or moved to another streaming service.

==Syndication==

Punk'd began in off-network syndication in 2008 and in the fall of that year, [[Trifecta Entertainment & Media]] put it into barter syndication and aired on affiliates of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[MyNetworkTV]], [[The CW]], and [[Independent station (North America)|Independent]] stations. However as of fall 2012, the show has left local syndication along with [[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]] and [[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]] due to lack of ratings.
