The region that is now Northern Ireland was the bedrock of the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Irish war of resistance]] against [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[Plantations of Ireland|programmes of colonialism]] in the late 16th century. The English-controlled [[Kingdom of Ireland]] had been declared by the English king [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1542, but Irish resistance made English control fragmentary. Following Irish defeat at the [[Battle of Kinsale]], though, the region's [[Gaels|Gaelic]], Roman Catholic [[aristocracy]] [[Flight of the Earls|fled to continental Europe]] in 1607 and the region became subject to major programmes of colonialism by Protestant English (mainly [[Anglican]]) and Scottish (mainly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) settlers. [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|A rebellion in 1641]] by Irish aristocrats against English rule resulted in a massacre of settlers in Ulster in the context of a [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|war breaking out between England, Scotland and Ireland]] fuelled by religious intolerance in government. Victories by English forces in that war and further Protestant victories in the [[Williamite War in Ireland]] (1688–1691) toward the close of the 17th century solidified [[Church of Ireland|Anglican]] rule in Ireland. In Northern Ireland, the victories of the [[Siege of Derry]] (1689) and the [[Battle of the Boyne]] (1690) in this latter war are still celebrated by some Protestants (both Anglican and Presbyterian).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/government-citizens-and-rights/living-in-northern-ireland/bank-holidays.htm |title=Bank holidays |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122114013/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/government-citizens-and-rights/living-in-northern-ireland/bank-holidays.htm |archive-date=22 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20565591 |title=Lundy's Day: Thousands attend 'peaceful' Londonderry parade |website=BBC News}}</ref>

Popes [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]] and [[Pope Alexander VIII|Alexander VIII]] had supported [[William III of England|William of Orange]] instead of his maternal uncle and father-in-law [[James II of England|James II]], despite William being Protestant and James a Catholic, due to William's participation in alliance with both Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe in wars against [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (the "Sun King"), the powerful King of France who had been in conflict with the papacy for decades. In 1693, however, [[Pope Innocent XII]] recognised James as continuing King of Great Britain and Ireland in place of William, after reconciliation with Louis.  In 1695, and contrary to the terms of the [[Treaty of Limerick]] (October 1691), a series of [[penal laws]] were passed by the [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglican ruling class]] in Ireland in intense anger at the Pope's recognition of James over William, which was felt to be a betrayal. The intention of the laws was to materially disadvantage the Catholic community and, to a lesser extent, the Presbyterian community. In the context of open institutional discrimination, the 18th century saw [[secret societies|secret, militant societies]] develop in communities in the region and act on [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] tensions in violent attacks. These events escalated at the end of the century following an event known as the [[Battle of the Diamond]], which saw the supremacy of the Anglican and Presbyterian [[Peep o'Day Boys]] over the Catholic [[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]] and leading to the formation of the Anglican [[Orange Order]]. [[1798 Rebellion|A rebellion in 1798]] led by the cross-community Belfast-based [[Society of the United Irishmen]] and inspired by the [[French Revolution]] sought to break the constitutional ties between Ireland and Britain and unite Irish people of all religions. Following this, in an attempt to quell sectarianism and force the removal of discriminatory laws (and to prevent the spread of French-style republicanism to Ireland), the government of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] pushed for the two kingdoms to be merged. The new state, formed in 1801, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], was governed from a single government and parliament based in London.

Some 250,000 people from Ulster emigrated to the British North American colonies between 1717 and 1775.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thernstrom |first=Stephan |title=Harvard encyclopedia of American ethnic groups |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC&pg=PA896 |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1980 |page=896 |isbn=978-0-674-37512-3 |access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref> It is estimated that there are more than 27&nbsp;million [[Scotch-Irish American]]s now living in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780767916899-1 |title=Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America |publisher=Powells.com |date=12 August 2009 |access-date=30 April 2010}}</ref> along with many [[Scotch-Irish Canadians]] in Canada.

[[File:Carson signing Solemn League and Covenant.jpg|thumb|Signing of the [[Ulster Covenant]] in 1912 in opposition to Home Rule]]
During the 19th century, [[Catholic Emancipation|legal reforms]] started in the late 18th century continued to remove statutory discrimination against Catholics, and progressive programmes enabled tenant farmers to buy land from landlords. By the close of the century, a large and disciplined cohort of [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Nationalist]] MPs at [[Westminster]] committed the [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] to autonomy&mdash;[[Irish Home Rule movement|"Home Rule"]]&mdash;for Ireland, a prospect bitterly opposed by [[Unionism in Ireland|Irish Unionists]]. In 1912, after decades of obstruction from the [[House of Lords]], and with a Liberal government dependent on Nationalist support, Home Rule became a near-certainty. A clash between the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and House of Lords over a controversial budget produced the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which enabled the veto of the Lords to be overturned. The House of Lords veto had been the unionists' main guarantee that Home Rule would not be enacted because the majority of members of the House of Lords were unionists. In response, opponents to Home Rule, from [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative and Unionist Party]] leaders such as [[Bonar Law]] and Dublin-based [[barrister]] [[Edward Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] to militant working class unionists in Ireland, threatened the use of violence. In 1914, [[Larne Gun Running|they smuggled thousands of rifles and rounds of ammunition]] from [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] for use by the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF), a paramilitary organisation opposed to the implementation of Home Rule.

[[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] were in a minority in Ireland as a whole, but in the northern province of [[Ulster]] they were a very large majority in [[County Antrim]] and [[County Down]], small majorities in [[County Armagh]] and [[County Londonderry]] and a substantial minority in Ulster's five other counties.<ref name="StephenGwynn">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWnrSFoQVw0C&q=%22northern+ireland%22+partition+two+counties+nationalist+majority+tyrone+fermanagh&pg=PA525 |first=Stephen |last=Gwynn |author-link=Stephen Gwynn |chapter=The birth of the Irish Free State |title=The History of Ireland |year=2009 |orig-year=1923 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-1-113-15514-6}}</ref> The four counties named, along with [[County Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone]], would later constitute Northern Ireland. Most of the remaining 26 counties which later became the Republic of Ireland were overwhelmingly majority-nationalist.

During the [[Home Rule Crisis]], the possibility was discussed of a "temporary" partition of these six counties from the rest of Ireland. In 1914, the Third Home Rule Bill received [[Royal Assent]] as the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]]. However, its implementation was suspended before it came into effect because of the outbreak of the [[First World War]], and the Amending Bill to partition Ireland was abandoned. The war was expected to last only a few weeks but in fact, lasted four years. By the end of the war (during which the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] had taken place), the Act was seen as unimplementable. Public opinion among nationalists had shifted during the war from a demand for home rule to one for full independence. In 1919, [[David Lloyd George]] proposed a new bill be established by the cabinet's ''[[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long#Political career, 1911–1921|Walter Long]] Committee'' on Ireland, which by adopting findings of his (Lloyd George's) inconclusive 1917-18 [[Irish Convention#Home Rule after-life|Irish Convention]] would divide Ireland into two Home Rule areas: twenty-six counties being ruled from [[Dublin]] and six being ruled from [[Belfast]]. Straddling these two areas would be a shared [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] who would appoint both governments and a [[Council of Ireland]], which Lloyd George believed would evolve into an all-Ireland parliament.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pilkington |first=Colin |author-link=Colin Pilkington |title=Devolution in Britain Today |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=2002 |page=75 |isbn=978-0-7190-6076-2}}</ref>

Events overtook the government. The pro-independence [[Sinn Féin]] won 73 of the 105 parliamentary seats in Ireland at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1918]], and unilaterally established the [[First Dáil]], an extrajudicial parliament in Ireland. [[Partition of Ireland|Ireland was partitioned]] between Northern Ireland and [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] in 1921, under the terms of Lloyd George's [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]],<ref>Northern Ireland became a distinct region of the United Kingdom, by [[Order in Council]] on 3 May 1921 (Statutory Rules & Orders published by authority (SR&O) 1921, No. 533).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Its constitutional roots remain the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]], two complementary Acts, one passed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], the other by the pre-1801 [[Parliament of Ireland]].</ref> during the [[Anglo-Irish War]] between Irish republican and British forces. A truce was established on 11 July; the war ended on 6 December 1921 with the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], which created the [[Irish Free State]]. Under the terms of the treaty, Northern Ireland would become part of the Free State unless the government opted out by presenting an address to the king, although in practice partition remained in place.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Ged |editor1-last=Anderson |editor1-first=Malcolm |editor2-last=Bort |editor2-first=Eberhard |title=The Irish Border: History, Politics, Culture |date=1999 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=978-0853239512 |page=68 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59OPsS6a4j4C&pg=PA68 |access-date=19 October 2015 |chapter=The Origins of Partition}}</ref>

As expected, the Houses of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] resolved on 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State) to exercise its right to opt out of the Free State by making an address to the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gibbons|first1=Ivan|title=The British Labour Party and the Establishment of the Irish Free State, 1918–1924|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1137444080|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pO6_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA107|access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref> The text of the address was: {{Quote|Most Gracious Sovereign, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922]], being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149|title=The Stormont Papers – View Volumes|access-date=28 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415143605/http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149|archive-date=15 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/anglo_irish/dfaexhib2.html |title=Anglo-Irish Treaty, sections 11, 12 |publisher=Nationalarchives.ie |date=6 December 1921 |access-date=7 August 2013}}</ref>}} Shortly afterwards, the [[Irish Boundary Commission|Boundary Commission]] was established to decide on the territorial boundaries between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Owing to the outbreak of [[Irish Civil War|civil war in the Free State]], the work of the commission was delayed until 1925. Leaders in Dublin expected a substantial reduction in the territory of Northern Ireland, with nationalist areas moving to the Free State. However, the commission's report recommended only that some small portions of land should be ceded from Northern Ireland to the Free State and even that a small amount of land should be ceded from the Free State to Northern Ireland. To prevent argument, this report was suppressed and, in exchange for a waiver to the Free State's obligations to the UK's public debt and the dissolution of the Council of Ireland (sought by the [[Government of Northern Ireland]]), the initial six-county border was maintained with no changes.

In June 1940, to encourage the [[Irish neutrality|neutral Irish state]] to join with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] indicated to the [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] that the United Kingdom would push for Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer.<ref>"Anglo-Irish Relations, 1939–41: A Study in Multilateral Diplomacy and Military Restraint" in ''Twentieth Century British History'' (Oxford Journals, 2005), {{ISSN|1477-4674}}</ref> The British did not inform the Government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Dublin government, and de Valera's rejection was not publicised until 1970.

The [[Ireland Act 1949]] gave the first legal guarantee that the region would not cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]].

====The Troubles====

{{Main|The Troubles}}

The Troubles, which started in the late 1960s, consisted of about 30 years of recurring acts of intense violence during which 3,254 people were killed<ref>Malcolm Sutton's book, "Bear in Mind These Dead: An Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland 1969–1993.</ref> with over 50,000 casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/troubles_violence|title=BBC – History – The Troubles – Violence}}</ref> From 1969 to 2003 there were over 36,900 shooting incidents and over 16,200 bombings or attempted bombings associated with The Troubles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulster.ac.uk/ni/security.htm#05|title=CAIN: Northern Ireland Society – Security and Defence}}</ref> The conflict was caused by the disputed status of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom and the discrimination against the [[Irish nationalist]] minority by the dominant [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cameron2.htm#chap16|title=The Cameron Report – Disturbances in Northern Ireland (1969)|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref> From 1967 to 1972 the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA), which modelled itself on the US civil rights movement, led a campaign of [[civil resistance]] to anti-Catholic discrimination in housing, employment, policing, and electoral procedures. The franchise for local government elections included only rate-payers and their spouses, and so excluded over a quarter of the electorate. While the majority of disenfranchised electors were Protestant, Catholics were over-represented since they were poorer and had more adults still living in the family home.<ref>[http://www.gale.cengage.com/pdf/whitepapers/gdc/Sectarianism.pdf History of sectarianism in NI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201224942/http://www.gale.cengage.com/pdf/whitepapers/gdc/Sectarianism.pdf |date= 1 February 2014 }}, gale.cengage.com; accessed 27 May 2015.</ref>

[[File:Troubles deaths by perpetrator.png|thumb|upright=2|left|Responsibility for Troubles-related deaths between 1969 and 2001]]

NICRA's campaign, seen by many unionists as an [[Irish republican]] front, and the violent reaction to it proved to be a precursor to a more violent period.<ref>Richard English, "The Interplay of Non-violent and Violent Action in Northern Ireland, 1967–72", in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009; {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, pp. 75–90. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&source=gbs_navlinks_s]</ref> As early as 1969, armed campaigns of paramilitary groups began, including the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997|Provisional IRA campaign of 1969–1997]] which was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland and the creation of a [[United Ireland]], and the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]], formed in 1966 in response to the perceived erosion of both the British character and unionist domination of Northern Ireland. The state security forces – the [[British Army]] and the police (the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]) – were also involved in the violence. The British government's position is that its forces were neutral in the conflict, trying to uphold law and order in Northern Ireland and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to democratic self-determination. Republicans regarded the state forces as [[combatants]] in the conflict, pointing to the [[The Troubles#Collusion between security forces and loyalist paramilitaries|collusion between the state forces and the loyalist paramilitaries]] as proof of this.  The "Ballast" investigation by the [[Police Ombudsman]] has confirmed that British forces, and in particular the RUC, did collude with [[Ulster Loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitaries, were involved in murder, and did obstruct the course of justice when such claims had been investigated,<ref name="Ballast">[http://www.policeombudsman.org//Publicationsuploads/BALLAST%20PUBLIC%20STATEMENT%2022-01-07%20FINAL%20VERSION.pdf The Ballast report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625041216/http://www.policeombudsman.org//Publicationsuploads/BALLAST%20PUBLIC%20STATEMENT%2022-01-07%20FINAL%20VERSION.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }}: "...the Police Ombudsman has concluded that this was collusion by certain police officers with identified UVF informants."</ref> although the extent to which such collusion occurred is still disputed.

As a consequence of the worsening security situation, autonomous regional government for Northern Ireland was suspended in 1972. Alongside the violence, there was a political deadlock between the major political parties in Northern Ireland, including those who condemned violence, over the future status of Northern Ireland and the form of government there should be within Northern Ireland. In 1973, [[Northern Ireland referendum, 1973|Northern Ireland held a referendum]] to determine if it should remain in the United Kingdom, or be part of a united Ireland. The vote went heavily in favour (98.9%) of maintaining the status quo. Approximately 57.5% of the total electorate voted in support, but only 1% of Catholics voted following a boycott organised by the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/9/newsid_2516000/2516477.stm|work=BBC News|title=1973: Northern Ireland votes for union|date=9 March 1973|access-date=20 May 2010}}</ref>

====Peace process====
{{Main|Northern Ireland peace process}}

The Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]] which included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations and the complete decommissioning of their weapons, the reform of the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of army troops from the streets and from sensitive border areas such as South Armagh and [[Fermanagh]], as agreed by the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the "[[Good Friday Agreement]]"). This reiterated the long-held British position, which had never before been fully acknowledged by successive Irish governments, that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom until a majority of voters in Northern Ireland decides otherwise. The [[Constitution of Ireland]] was amended in 1999 to remove a claim of the "Irish nation" to sovereignty over the entire island (in Article 2).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/546146.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} NORTHERN IRELAND {{!}} Republic drops claim to NI|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Scottish_and_Northern_Ireland_Ministers.jpg|thumb|First Minister [[Ian Paisley]] (DUP) centre, and deputy First Minister [[Martin McGuinness]] (Sinn Féin) left, and Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] right in 2008]]
The new [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]], added to the Constitution to replace the earlier articles, implicitly acknowledge that the status of Northern Ireland, and its relationships within the rest of the United Kingdom and with the Republic of Ireland, would only be changed with the agreement of a majority of voters in each jurisdiction. This aspect was also central to the Belfast Agreement which was signed in 1998 and ratified by referendums held simultaneously in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. At the same time, the British Government recognised for the first time, as part of the prospective, the so-called "Irish dimension": the principle that the people of the island of Ireland as a whole have the right, without any outside interference, to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.<ref name="Parliament">[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199394/cmhansrd/1993-12-15/Debate-1.html Parliamentary debate]: "The British government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish."</ref> The latter statement was key to winning support for the agreement from nationalists. It established a devolved power-sharing government within Northern Ireland, which must consist of both unionist and nationalist parties. These institutions were suspended by the [[British Government]] in 2002 after [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) allegations of spying by people working for Sinn Féin at the Assembly ([[Stormontgate]]). The resulting case against the accused Sinn Féin member collapsed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/14561|title=Securocrat sabotage exposed}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3SFzfha7VYC&q=collapse+stormontgate+donaldson&pg=PA306|title=Bear in Mind These Dead|isbn=9780571252183|last1=McKay|first1=Susan|date=2 April 2009}}</ref>

On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA declared an end to its campaign and has since decommissioned what is thought to be all of its [[arsenal]]. This final act of decommissioning was performed under the watch of the [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning]] (IICD) and two external church witnesses. Many unionists, however, remained sceptical. The IICD later confirmed that the main loyalist paramilitary groups, the [[Ulster Defence Association]], UVF and the [[Red Hand Commando]], had decommissioned what is thought to be all of their arsenals, witnessed by former archbishop [[Robin Eames]] and a former top civil servant.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8442683.stm "UDA confirm guns decommissioned"] BBC news; retrieved 29 January 2014</ref>

Politicians elected to the Assembly at the [[2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2003 Assembly election]] were called together on 15 May 2006 under the Northern Ireland Act 2006<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060017_en_1|title=Northern Ireland Act 2006 (c. 17)|publisher=Opsi.gov.uk|access-date=16 June 2010}}</ref> for the purpose of electing a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]] and choosing the members of an Executive (before 25 November 2006) as a preliminary step to the restoration of devolved government.

Following the [[2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election|election]] held on 7 March 2007, devolved government returned on 8 May 2007 with [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) leader [[Ian Paisley]] and Sinn Féin deputy leader [[Martin McGuinness]] taking office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively.<ref>(BBC)</ref> In its white paper on [[Brexit]] the United Kingdom government reiterated its commitment to the Belfast Agreement. With regard to Northern Ireland's status, it said that the UK Government's "clearly-stated preference is to retain Northern Ireland’s current constitutional position: as part of the UK, but with strong links to Ireland".<ref>HM Government ''The United Kingdom's exit from and new partnership with the European Union''; Cm 9417, February 2017</ref>

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Northern Ireland}}

===Background===
[[File:Political Parties of Northern Ireland.png|thumb|A flowchart illustrating all the political parties that have existed throughout the history of Northern Ireland and leading up to its formation (1889 onwards).]]The main political divide in Northern Ireland is between unionists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland unified with the Republic of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom.  These two opposing views are linked to deeper cultural divisions. Unionists are predominantly [[Ulster Protestant]], descendants of mainly [[Scottish people|Scottish]], English, and [[Huguenot]] settlers as well as [[Gaels]] who converted to one of the Protestant denominations. Nationalists are overwhelmingly Catholic and descend from the population predating the settlement, with a minority from the [[Scottish Highlands]] as well as some converts from Protestantism. Discrimination against nationalists under the [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]] government (1921–1972) gave rise to the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement|civil rights movement]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm|title=Professor John H. Whyte paper on discrimination in Northern Ireland|publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=16 June 2010}}</ref>

While some unionists argue that discrimination was not just due to religious or political bigotry, but also the result of more complex socio-economic, socio-political and geographical factors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/sum.htm|title=CAIN website key issues discrimination summary|publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|date=5 October 1968 |access-date=16 June 2010}}</ref> its existence, and the manner in which nationalist anger at it was handled, were a major contributing factor to the Troubles. The political unrest went through its most violent phase between 1968 and 1994.<ref>Lord Scarman, "Violence and Civil Disturbances in Northern Ireland in 1969: Report of Tribunal of Inquiry" Belfast: HMSO, Cmd 566 (known as the ''Scarman Report'').</ref>

In 2007, 36% of the population defined themselves as unionist, 24% as nationalist and 40% defined themselves as neither.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2007/Political_Attitudes/UNINATID.html|title=Ark survey, 2007. Answer to the question "Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as a unionist, a nationalist or neither?"|publisher=Ark.ac.uk|date=17 May 2007|access-date=16 June 2010}}</ref> According to a 2015 opinion poll, 70% express a long-term preference of the maintenance of Northern Ireland's membership of the United Kingdom (either [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|directly ruled]] or with [[Devolution|devolved government]]), while 14% express a preference for membership of a united Ireland.<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/NIRELND2.html Answers to the question "Do you think the long-term policy for Northern Ireland should be for it (one of the following)]"</ref> This discrepancy can be explained by the overwhelming preference among Protestants to remain a part of the UK (93%), while Catholic preferences are spread across a number of solutions to the constitutional question including remaining a part of the UK (47%), a united Ireland (32%), Northern Ireland becoming an independent state (4%), and those who "don't know" (16%).<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/NIRELND2.html NILT survey, 2015]. Answers to the question "Do you think the long-term policy for Northern Ireland should be for it to [one of the following"], ark.ac.uk; accessed 27 May 2015.</ref>

Official voting figures, which reflect views on the "national question" along with issues of candidate, geography, personal loyalty and historic voting patterns, show 54% of Northern Ireland voters vote for unionist parties, 42% vote for nationalist parties and 4% vote "other". Opinion polls consistently show that the election results are not necessarily an indication of the electorate's stance regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Most of the population of Northern Ireland are at least nominally Christian, mostly Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations. Many voters (regardless of religious affiliation) are attracted to unionism's [[National conservatism|conservative]] policies, while other voters are instead attracted to the traditionally leftist Sinn Féin and SDLP and their respective party platforms for [[democratic socialism]] and [[social democracy]].<ref name="autogenerated2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2009/Political_Attitudes/NIRELND2.html|title=NI Life and Times Survey – 2009: NIRELND2|publisher=Ark.ac.uk|year=2009|access-date=13 July 2010}}</ref>

For the most part, Protestants feel a strong connection with Great Britain and wish for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Many Catholics however, generally aspire to a United Ireland or are less certain about how to solve the constitutional question. In the 2015 survey by Northern Ireland Life and Times, 47% of Northern Irish Catholics supported Northern Ireland remaining a part of the United Kingdom, either by direct rule (6%) or devolved government (41%).

Protestants have a slight majority in Northern Ireland, according to the latest Northern Ireland Census. The make-up of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] reflects the appeals of the various parties within the population. Of the 90 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs)]], 40 are unionists and 39 are nationalists (the remaining 11 are classified as "other").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election/ni2017/results|title=Northern Ireland Assembly election 2017 results|website=BBC News}}</ref>

===Governance===
{{Main|Elections in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland law}}
[[File:StormontGeneral.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]], [[Belfast]], seat of the assembly]]
Since 1998, Northern Ireland has had [[devolution|devolved]] government within the United Kingdom, presided over by the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and a cross-community government (the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]). The UK Government and UK Parliament are responsible for [[reserved and excepted matters]]. Reserved matters comprise listed policy areas (such as [[civil aviation]], [[units of measurement]], and [[human genetics]]) that Parliament may devolve to the Assembly some time in the future. Excepted matters (such as [[international relations]], taxation and elections) are never expected to be considered for devolution. On all other governmental matters, the Executive together with the 90-member Assembly may legislate for and govern Northern Ireland. Devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland executive in the [[North/South Ministerial Council]], which coordinates areas of co-operation (such as agriculture, education and health) between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Additionally, "in recognition of the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland", the [[Government of Ireland]] and [[Government of the United Kingdom]] co-operate closely on non-devolved matters through the [[British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference]].

Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly are by [[single transferable vote]] with five Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) elected from each of 18 [[List of parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland|parliamentary constituencies]]. In addition, eighteen representatives (Members of Parliament, MPs) are elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|lower house of the UK parliament]] from the same constituencies using the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] system. However, not all of those elected take their seats. Sinn Féin MPs, currently seven, refuse to take the oath to serve the Queen that is required before MPs are allowed to take their seats. In addition, the upper house of the UK parliament, the [[House of Lords]], currently has some 25 appointed [[List of Northern Ireland members of the House of Lords|members from Northern Ireland]].

The [[Northern Ireland Office]] represents the UK government in Northern Ireland on reserved matters and represents Northern Ireland's interests within the UK Government. Additionally, the Republic's government also has the right to "put forward views and proposals" on non-devolved matters in relation to Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office is led by the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], who sits in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]].

<!-- Commented out: [[File:StormontChamber.JPG|thumb|right|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Assembly Chamber]] at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]].]] -->
Northern Ireland is a distinct legal [[jurisdiction]], separate from the two other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom ([[English law|England and Wales]], and [[Scots law|Scotland]]). [[Northern Ireland law]] developed from Irish law that existed before the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1921. Northern Ireland is a [[common law]] jurisdiction and its common law is similar to that in England and Wales. However, there are important differences in law and procedure between Northern Ireland and England and Wales. The body of [[Statutory law|statute law]] affecting Northern Ireland reflects the history of Northern Ireland, including Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the former [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and the [[Parliament of Ireland]], along with some Acts of the [[Parliament of England]] and of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] that were extended to Ireland under [[Poynings' Law (confirmation of English statutes)|Poynings' Law]] between 1494 and 1782.

===<span id="descriptions">Descriptions</span>===
There is no generally accepted term to describe what Northern Ireland is: province, region, country or something else.<ref name="alphabeticalNI"/><ref name="interpretingNI"/><ref name="placeApart"/> The choice of term can be controversial and can reveal the writer's political preferences.<ref name="interpretingNI"/> This has been noted as a problem by several writers on Northern Ireland, with no generally recommended solution.<ref name="alphabeticalNI"/><ref name="interpretingNI"/><ref name="placeApart"/>

Owing in part to the way in which the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, came into being, there is no legally defined term to describe what Northern Ireland 'is'. There is also no uniform or guiding way to refer to Northern Ireland amongst the agencies of the UK government. For example, the websites of the Office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom<ref name=Number10CountriesWithinACountry/> and the [[UK Statistics Authority]] describe the United Kingdom as being made up of four countries, one of these being Northern Ireland.<ref name=UKStatisticsAuthorityGeographyOfTheUK>{{cite web

===Alternative names===
{{Main|Alternative names for Northern Ireland}}

Many people inside and outside Northern Ireland use other names for Northern Ireland, depending on their point of view. Disagreement on names, and the reading of political symbolism into the use or non-use of a word, also attaches itself to some urban centres. The most notable example is whether Northern Ireland's second city should be called [[Derry-Londonderry name dispute|"Derry" or "Londonderry"]].

Choice of language and [[nomenclature]] in Northern Ireland often reveals the cultural, ethnic and religious identity of the speaker. Those who do not belong to any group but lean towards one side often tend to use the language of that group. Supporters of unionism in the British media (notably ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[Daily Express]]'') regularly call Northern Ireland "Ulster".<ref>{{cite news|last=Peterkin |first=Tom |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1509280/IRA-fuel-smuggling-drove-oil-giants-to-abandon-Ulster.html |title=Example of Daily Telegraph use of "Ulster" in text of an article, having used "Northern Ireland" in the opening paragraph |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=31 January 2006 |access-date=16 June 2010}}</ref> Many media outlets in the Republic use "North of Ireland", or simply "the North".<ref name=Abortion-in-the-North-of-Ireland/><ref name=Calls-for-More-Supports-in_Norths-Schools/><ref name=RTE-does-not-stop-people-in-the-North/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30741054.html |title='Abortion drone' delivers pills to the North from Ireland | work=[[Irish Examiner]] |date=21 June 2016 |access-date=21 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| first=Philip |last=Ryan |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/varadkar-considers-travel-ban-but-wont-stop-northsouth-travel-39048435.html |title=Varadkar considers travel ban but won't stop North/South travel | work=Irish Independent |date=21 June 2016 |access-date=21 June 2016}}</ref> The "Six Counties" is used less often.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' has also used "the North".<ref>{{cite news| first1=Andrew |last1=Testa |first2=Megan |last2=Specia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/world/europe/northern-ireland-brexit-border.html |title=Example of New York Times use of "the North" in text of an article (fifth paragraph), having used "Northern Ireland" earlier |work=The New York Times |date=15 October 2018 |access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref>

Government and cultural organisations in Northern Ireland often use the word "Ulster" in their title; for example, the [[University of Ulster]], the [[Ulster Museum]], the [[Ulster Orchestra]], and [[BBC Radio Ulster]].

Although some news bulletins since the 1990s have opted to avoid all contentious terms and use the official name, Northern Ireland, the term "the North" remains commonly used by broadcast media in the Republic.<ref name=Abortion-in-the-North-of-Ireland>{{cite news|url=https://www.newstalk.com/podcasts/highlights-from-moncrieff/abortion-north-ireland |title=Abortion in the North of Ireland: Grainne Teggart campaigns manager for Amnesty International NI joins Sean to discuss the problems around abortion in the North of Ireland |publisher=[[Newstalk]] |date=3 June 2020 |access-date=3 June 2020}}</ref><ref name=Calls-for-More-Supports-in_Norths-Schools>{{cite news|url=https://www.highlandradio.com/2020/09/10/calls-for-more-supports-in-norths-schools-after-covid-cases/ |title=Calls for more supports in North's schools after Covid cases |publisher=Highland Radio |date=10 September 2020 |access-date=10 September 2020}}</ref><ref name=RTE-does-not-stop-people-in-the-North>{{cite news| first=John |last=Monaghan |url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2018/07/14/news/rte-head-of-sport-says-broadcaster-does-not-stop-people-in-the-north-watching-gaelic-games-1382277/ |title=RTÉ head of sport says broadcaster does not stop people in the north watching gaelic games | work=The Irish News |date=14 July 2018 |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote=RTÉ is a '32-county broadcaster' and 'do not stop people in the north watching gaelic games', its new head of sport has said...

====Unionist====
* '''Ulster''', strictly speaking, refers to the province of [[Ulster]], of which six of nine historical counties are in Northern Ireland. The term "Ulster" is widely used by unionists and the British press as shorthand for Northern Ireland, and is also favoured by [[Ulster nationalism|Ulster nationalists]].<ref>Examples of usage of this term include [[Radio Ulster]], [[Ulster Orchestra]] and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]]; political parties such as the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]'; paramilitary organisations including the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and [[Ulster Volunteer Force]]; and political campaigns such as "[[Ulster Says No]]" and "[[Save Ulster from Sodomy]]".</ref> In the past, calls have been made for Northern Ireland's name to be changed to Ulster. This proposal was formally considered by the Government of Northern Ireland in 1937 and by the UK Government in 1949 but no change was made.<ref>Parliamentary Reports of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, Volume 20 (1937) and ''The Times'', 6 January 1949; C.M. 1(49) – UK Cabinet meeting held on 12 January 1949. C.M. 1(49). – See also [[Alternative names for Northern Ireland]]</ref>
* '''The Province''' refers to the historic Irish province of Ulster but today is used by some as shorthand for Northern Ireland. The [[BBC]], in its editorial guidance for ''Reporting the United Kingdom'', states that "the Province" is an appropriate secondary synonym for Northern Ireland, while "Ulster" is not. It also suggests that "people of Northern Ireland" is preferred to "British" or "Irish", and the term "mainland" should be avoided in reference to Great Britain in relation to Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Editorial Policy, Guidance Note |publisher=BBC  |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/page/guidance-uk-full#style-and-language |access-date=20 April 2012 |date=n.d.}} "The term "province" is often used synonymously with Northern Ireland and it is normally appropriate to make secondary references to "the province"."</ref>

====Nationalist====
* '''North of Ireland''' – used to avoid using the name given by the British-enacted Government of Ireland Act 1920.
* '''The Six Counties''' ({{lang|ga|na Sé Chontae}}) – the Republic of Ireland is similarly described as the Twenty-Six Counties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sinnfein.ie/history |title=Sinn Féin usage of "Six Counties" |publisher=[[Sinn Féin]] |date=14 August 1969 |access-date=16 June 2010 }}</ref> Some of the users of these terms contend that using the official name of the region would imply acceptance of the legitimacy of the Government of Ireland Act.

====Other====
* '''Norn Iron''' or "Norniron" – is an informal and affectionate<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/how-much-do-you-know-about-norn-iron How much do you know about 'Norn Iron'?],
 British Embassy Ashgabat</ref> local nickname used to refer to Northern Ireland, derived from the pronunciation of the words "Northern Ireland" in an exaggerated Ulster accent (particularly one from the greater Belfast area). The phrase is seen as a lighthearted way to refer to Northern Ireland, based as it is on regional pronunciation. It often refers to the [[Northern Ireland national football team]].<ref>{{cite news|title=World Cup qualifiers: 10 talking points from the weekend's action|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/sep/09/world-cup-qualifiers-talking-points|date=9 September 2013|access-date=9 September 2013|first1=Daniel|last1=Taylor|first2=Ewan|last2=Murray|first3=David|last3=Hytner|first4=Simon|last4=Burnton|first5=Barry|last5=Glendenning|work=The Guardian|location=UK}}</ref>

[[File:Lough Neagh - geograph.org.uk - 488526.jpg|thumb|[[Lough Neagh]]]]
Northern Ireland was covered by an [[ice sheet]] for most of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]] and on numerous previous occasions, the legacy of which can be seen in the extensive coverage of [[drumlin]]s in Counties Fermanagh, Armagh, Antrim and particularly Down.

The centrepiece of Northern Ireland's geography is [[Lough Neagh]], at {{convert|151|sqmi|km2|0}} the largest freshwater lake both on the island of Ireland and in the [[British Isles]]. A second extensive lake system is centred on Lower and Upper [[Lough Erne]] in Fermanagh. The largest island of Northern Ireland is [[Rathlin Island|Rathlin]], off the north Antrim coast. [[Strangford Lough]] is the largest inlet in the British Isles, covering {{convert|150|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Hare's Gap - geograph.org.uk - 66827.jpg|thumb|Hare's Gap, [[Mourne Mountains]]]]
There are substantial uplands in the [[Sperrin Mountains]] (an extension of the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian mountain belt]]) with extensive gold deposits, [[granite]] [[Mourne Mountains]] and [[basalt]] [[Antrim Plateau]], as well as smaller ranges in [[County Armagh|South Armagh]] and along the Fermanagh–Tyrone border. None of the hills are especially high, with [[Slieve Donard]] in the dramatic Mournes reaching {{convert|850|m|ft|0}}, Northern Ireland's highest point. Belfast's most prominent peak is [[Cavehill]].

[[File:Causeway-code poet-4.jpg|thumb|The [[Giant's Causeway]], [[County Antrim]]]]
The volcanic activity which created the Antrim Plateau also formed the eerily geometric pillars of the [[Giant's Causeway]] on the north Antrim coast. Also in north Antrim are the [[Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge]], [[Mussenden Temple]] and the [[Glens of Antrim]].

[[File:Marble Arch Caves - Skreen Hill streamway.jpeg|thumb|[[Marble Arch Caves]]]]
The Lower and Upper [[River Bann]], [[River Foyle]] and [[River Blackwater, Northern Ireland|River Blackwater]] form extensive fertile lowlands, with excellent [[arable land]] also found in North and East Down, although much of the hill country is marginal and suitable largely for animal husbandry.

The valley of the [[River Lagan]] is dominated by Belfast, whose metropolitan area includes over a third of the population of Northern Ireland, with heavy urbanisation and industrialisation along the Lagan Valley and both shores of [[Belfast Lough]].

The vast majority of Northern Ireland has a [[maritime climate|temperate maritime climate]], (''Cfb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]) rather wetter in the west than the east, although cloud cover is very common across the region. The weather is unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America. Average daytime maximums in Belfast are {{convert|6.5|°C|°F}} in January and {{convert|17.5|°C|°F}} in July. The highest maximum temperature recorded was {{convert|30.8|°C|°F}} at Knockarevan, near [[Garrison, County Fermanagh]] on 30 June 1976 and at Belfast on 12 July 1983.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Ireland: climate|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/regional-climates/ni|publisher=Met Office|access-date=14 June 2015}}</ref> The lowest minimum temperature recorded was {{convert|-18.7|°C|°F|1}} at [[Castlederg]], [[County Tyrone]] on 23 December 2010.<ref name=MetO2010-12 />

Northern Ireland is the least forested part of the United Kingdom and Ireland, and one of the least forested parts of Europe.<ref>[https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/mediafile/100821804/10664-ni-welcome-leaflet-update-final-dec-2017.pdf Welcome to the Woodland Trust in Northern Ireland].

===Counties===
{{Main|Counties of Northern Ireland}}
Northern Ireland consists of six historic [[Counties of Ireland|counties]]: [[County Antrim]], [[County Armagh]], [[County Down]], [[County Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry]],<ref>Many Nationalists use the name ''County Derry''. {{Selfref|Wikipedia policy is to use Londonderry for the county and Derry for the city. The name usage does not indicate an endorsement for either community's opinions.}}</ref> [[County Tyrone]].

These counties are no longer used for local government purposes; instead, there are eleven [[districts of Northern Ireland]] which have different geographical extents. These were created in 2015, replacing the twenty-six districts which previously existed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/new-super-councils-begin-work-in-northern-ireland-1.2160407|title=New 'super councils' begin work in Northern Ireland|date=1 April 2015|website=The Irish Times}}</ref>

[[File:MussendenTemple.jpg|thumb|[[Mussenden Temple]], [[County Londonderry]]]]
Although counties are no longer used for local governmental purposes, they remain a popular means of describing where places are. They are officially used while applying for an [[Irish passport]], which requires one to state one's county of birth. The name of that county then appears in both Irish and English on the passport's information page, as opposed to the town or city of birth on the United Kingdom passport. The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] still uses the counties as its primary means of organisation and fields representative teams of each [[GAA county]]. The original system of [[License plates of Northern Ireland|car registration numbers]] largely based on counties still remains in use. In 2000, the [[Big Number Change#Northern Ireland|telephone numbering system]] was restructured into an 8 digit scheme with (except for Belfast) the first digit approximately reflecting the county.

The county boundaries still appear on Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland Maps and the Phillips Street Atlases, among others. With their decline in official use, there is often confusion surrounding towns and cities which lie near county boundaries, such as Belfast and [[Lisburn]], which are split between counties Down and Antrim (the majorities of both cities, however, are in Antrim).

In March 2018, ''The Sunday Times'' published its list of Best Places to Live in Britain, including the following places in Northern Ireland: [[Ballyhackamore]] near Belfast (overall best for Northern Ireland), Holywood, County Down, Newcastle, County Down, Portrush, County Antrim, Strangford, County Down.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishpost.com/life-style/five-places-in-northern-ireland-included-in-best-places-to-live-in-britain-list-151651|title=Five places in Northern Ireland included in Best Places to Live in Britain list - The Irish Post|first=Ryan|last=Price|access-date=5 August 2018}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Northern Ireland}}
[[File:'Titanic Quarter' development, Abercorn Basin, Belfast - geograph.org.uk - 1378153.jpg|thumb|right|Goliath crane of [[Harland & Wolff]] in [[Belfast]]]]

Northern Ireland has traditionally had an industrial economy, most notably in shipbuilding, rope manufacture and textiles, but most heavy industry has since been replaced by services, primarily the public sector.

Seventy percent of the economy's revenue comes from the service sector. Apart from the public sector, another important service sector is tourism, which rose to account for over 1% of the economy's revenue in 2004. Tourism has been a major growth area since the end of the Troubles. Key tourism attractions include the historic cities of Derry, Belfast and [[Armagh]] and the many castles in Northern Ireland. These large firms are attracted by government subsidies and the skilled workforce in Northern Ireland.

The local economy has seen contraction during the [[Great Recession]]. In response, the Northern Ireland Assembly has sent trade missions abroad. The Executive wishes to gain taxation powers from London, to align Northern Ireland's [[corporation tax]] rate with the unusually low rate of the Republic of Ireland.

==Transport==
{{main|Transport in Northern Ireland}}
[[File:Approaching Seahill station - geograph.org.uk - 243422.jpg|thumb|An [[Northern Ireland Railways|NIR]] [[NIR Class 3000|C3K]] [[railcar]]]]

Northern Ireland has underdeveloped [[Transport in Northern Ireland|transport infrastructure]], with most infrastructure concentrated around Greater Belfast, Greater Derry and Craigavon.  Northern Ireland is served by three airports – [[Belfast International Airport|Belfast International]] near [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]], [[George Best Belfast City Airport|George Best Belfast City]] integrated into the railway network at [[Sydenham railway station, Northern Ireland|Sydenham]] in East Belfast, and [[City of Derry Airport|City of Derry]] in County Londonderry.

Major seaports at [[Larne]] and [[Port of Belfast|Belfast]] carry passengers and freight between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Passenger railways are operated by [[Northern Ireland Railways]]. With [[Iarnród Éireann]] (Irish Rail), [[Northern Ireland Railways]] co-operates in providing the joint [[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]] service between [[Dublin Connolly]] and [[Lanyon Place railway station|Lanyon Place]]. The whole of Ireland has a mainline railway network with a [[Track gauge in Ireland|gauge of {{convert|5|ft|3|in|mm|abbr=on}}]], which is unique in Europe and has resulted in distinct rolling stock designs. The only preserved line of this gauge is the [[Downpatrick and County Down Railway]], which operates steam and diesel locomotives. Main railway lines linking to and from [[Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station]] and Lanyon Place railway station are:

* The [[Belfast–Derry railway line|Derry Line]] and the Portrush Branch.
* The Larne Line
* The Bangor Line
* The [[Portadown railway station|Portadown]] Line

Main motorways are:
* [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1]] connecting Belfast to the south and west, ending in [[Dungannon]]
* [[M12 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M12]] connecting the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1]] to [[Portadown]]
* [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] connecting Belfast to the north.  An unconnected section of the [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] also by-passes [[Ballymena]]
* [[M22 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M22]] connecting the [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] to near [[Randalstown]]

The population of Northern Ireland has risen yearly since 1978. The population in 2011 was 1.8&nbsp;million, having grown 7.5% over the previous decade<ref name="Census 2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/key_stats_bulletin_2011.pdf|title=Census Key Stats bulletin|publisher=[[NISRA]]|year=2012|access-date=11 December 2012}}</ref> from just under 1.7&nbsp;million in 2001. This constitutes just under 3% of the population of the UK (62&nbsp;million) and just over 28% of the population of the island of Ireland (6.3&nbsp;million).

The population of Northern Ireland is almost entirely [[White people|white]] (98.2%).<ref name="Census 2011"/> In 2011, 88.8% of the population were born in Northern Ireland, with 4.5% born elsewhere in Britain, and 2.9% born in the Republic of Ireland. 4.3% were born elsewhere; triple the amount there were in 2001.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-28031873 "NI migrant population triples in decade, says study"]. BBC News. 26 June 2014.</ref> Most are from Eastern Europe and [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]]. The largest non-white ethnic groups were [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] (6,300) and [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]] (6,200). [[Black people]] of various origins made up 0.2% of the 2011 population and people of mixed ethnicity made up 0.2%.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Religion===
At the 2011 census, 41.5% of the population identified as Protestant/non-Roman Catholic Christian, 41% as [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Roman Catholic]], and 0.8% as non-Christian, while 17% identified with no religion or did not state one.<ref name="ReferenceA">Census 2011</ref> The biggest of the Protestant/non-Roman Catholic Christian denominations were the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Presbyterian Church]] (19%), the [[Church of Ireland]] (14%) and the [[Methodist Church in Ireland|Methodist Church]] (3%). In terms of community background (i.e. religion or religion brought up in), 48% of the population came from a Protestant background, 45% from a Catholic background, 0.9% from non-Christian backgrounds, and 5.6% from non-religious backgrounds.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Several studies and surveys carried out between 1971 and 2006 have indicated that, in general, most Protestants in Northern Ireland see themselves primarily as British, whereas a majority of Roman Catholics regard themselves primarily as Irish.<ref>Breen, R., Devine, P. and Dowds, L.

The significance of the Belfast Agreement of 1998|author=Joseph Ruane and Jennifer Todd }}</ref> This does not, however, account for the [[People of Northern Ireland|complex identities within Northern Ireland]], given that many of the population regard themselves as "Ulster" or "Northern Irish", either as a primary or secondary identity. Overall, the Catholic population is somewhat more ethnically diverse than the more homogeneous Protestant population. 83.1% of Protestants identified as "British" or with a British ethnic group (English, Scottish, or Welsh) in the 2011 Census, whereas only 3.9% identified as "Irish". Meanwhile, 13.7% of Catholics identified as "British" or with a British ethnic group. A further 4.4% identified as "all other", which are largely immigrants, for example from [[Poland]].

A 2008 survey found that 57% of Protestants described themselves as British, while 32% identified as Northern Irish, 6% as Ulster and 4% as Irish. Compared to a similar survey carried out in 1998, this shows a fall in the percentage of Protestants identifying as British and Ulster and a rise in those identifying as Northern Irish. The 2008 survey found that 61% of Catholics described themselves as Irish, with 25% identifying as Northern Irish, 8% as British and 1% as Ulster. These figures were largely unchanged from the 1998 results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2008/Community_Relations/NINATID.html |title=Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, 2008; Module:Community Relations, Variable:IRISH |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=17 May 2007 |access-date=16 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1998/Community_Relations/NINATID.html |title=Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, 1998; Module:Community Relations, Variable:IRISH |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=9 May 2003 |access-date=16 June 2010}}</ref>

People born in Northern Ireland are, with some exceptions, deemed by UK law to be [[British nationality law|citizens of the United Kingdom]]. They are also, with similar exceptions, entitled to be [[Irish nationality law|citizens of Ireland]]. This entitlement was reaffirmed in the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] between the British and Irish governments, which provides that:

<blockquote>...it is the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly [the two governments] confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.</blockquote>

[[File:Predominant passport held northern ireland.png|thumb|Map of most commonly held passport]]
As a result of the Agreement, the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution of the Republic of Ireland]] was amended. The current wording provides that people born in Northern Ireland are entitled to be Irish citizens on the same basis as people from any other part of the island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/?docID=243 |title=Department of the Taoiseach |publisher=Taoiseach.gov.ie |access-date=16 June 2010}}</ref>

Neither government, however, extends its citizenship to all persons born in Northern Ireland. Both governments exclude some people born in Northern Ireland, in particular persons born without one parent who is a British or Irish citizen. The Irish restriction was given effect by the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|twenty-seventh amendment to the Irish Constitution]] in 2004. The position in UK nationality law is that most of those born in Northern Ireland are UK nationals, whether or not they so choose. Renunciation of British citizenship requires the payment of a fee, currently £372.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697987/Gov_uk_fees_revision_2018.pdf |title=Home Office Immigration & Nationality Charges 2018 |publisher=[[Home Office]] |date=6 April 2018 |access-date=12 September 2018}}</ref>

[[File:English dialects in Ulster contrast.png|thumb|right|Approximate boundaries of the current and historical English/[[Scots language|Scots]] dialects in [[Ulster]]. South to north, the colour bands represent [[Hiberno-English]], South-[[Ulster English]], Mid-Ulster English and the three traditional [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] areas. The Irish-speaking [[Gaeltacht]] is not shown.]]

English is spoken as a first language by almost all of the Northern Ireland population. It is the ''de facto'' official language and the [[Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737]] prohibits the use of languages other than English in legal proceedings.

Under the [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]], Irish and [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] (an Ulster dialect of the [[Scots language]], sometimes known as ''Ullans''), are recognised as "part of the cultural wealth of Northern Ireland".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.pdf |title=The Agreement |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003065655/http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.pdf |archive-date= 3 October 2011 }}&nbsp;{{small|(204&nbsp;KB)}}</ref> Two all-island bodies for the promotion of these were created under the Agreement: ''[[Foras na Gaeilge]]'', which promotes the Irish language, and the [[Ulster Scots Agency]], which promotes the Ulster Scots dialect and culture. These operate separately under the aegis of [[the North/South Language Body]], which reports to the [[North/South Ministerial Council]].

The [[British government]] in 2001 ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, with a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters. A lower level of recognition was accorded to Ulster Scots, under Part II of the Charter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/report/EvaluationReports/UKECRML3_en.pdf |title=Council of Europe Charter monitoring report, 2010 |access-date=7 August 2013}}</ref>

{{Main|Irish language in Northern Ireland|Ulster Irish}}

The Irish language ({{lang-ga|an Ghaeilge}}), or ''Gaelic'', is a native language of Ireland.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ryan |first=James G. |title=Irish Records: Sources for Family and Local History |publisher=Flyleaf Press |year=1997 |page=[https://archive.org/details/irishrecordssour0000ryan_s8k7/page/40 40] |isbn=978-0-916489-76-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/irishrecordssour0000ryan_s8k7/page/40 }}</ref> It was spoken predominantly throughout what is now Northern Ireland before the [[Ulster Plantations]] in the 17th century and most place names in Northern Ireland are [[anglicised]] versions of a Gaelic name. Today, the language is often associated with Irish nationalism (and thus with Catholics). However, in the 19th century, the language was seen as a common heritage, with Ulster Protestants playing a leading role in the [[Gaelic revival]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=28 January 2013|title=Presbyterians and the Irish Language Roger Blaney (Ulster Historical Foundation/The Ultach Trust, £6.50) ISBN 0-901905-75-5|url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/presbyterians-and-the-irish-language-roger-blaney-ulster-historical-foundationthe-ultach-trust-6-50-isbn-0-901905-75-5/|access-date=12 June 2020|website=History Ireland}}</ref>

In the 2011 census, 11% of the population of Northern Ireland claimed "some knowledge of Irish"<ref name="Census 2011"/> and 3.7% reported being able to "speak, read, write and understand" Irish.<ref name="Census 2011"/> In another survey, from 1999, 1% of respondents said they spoke it as their main language at home.<ref name = "Survey-NorthernIreland">Northern Ireland LIFE & TIMES Survey: [http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/MAINLANG.html What is the main language spoken in your own home?]</ref>

The dialect spoken in Northern Ireland, Ulster Irish, has two main types, East Ulster Irish and Donegal Irish (or West Ulster Irish),<ref name="pipex1">{{cite web |url=http://www.ultach.dsl.pipex.com/english/faqs.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416045904/http://www.ultach.dsl.pipex.com/english/faqs.htm |archive-date=16 April 2009 |title=Frequently-Asked Questions about the Irish Language |publisher=Ultach |access-date=7 February 2012}}</ref> is the one closest to [[Scottish Gaelic]] (which developed into a separate language from Irish Gaelic in the 17th century). Some words and phrases are shared with Scots Gaelic, and the dialects of east Ulster – those of [[Rathlin Island]] and the [[Glens of Antrim]] – were very similar to the dialect of [[Argyll]], the part of Scotland nearest to Ireland. And those dialects of Armagh and Down were also very similar to the dialects of Galloway.

Use of the Irish language in Northern Ireland today is politically sensitive. The erection by some [[Local government in Northern Ireland|district councils]] of bilingual street names in both English and Irish,<ref>The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (No. 759 (N.I. 5))[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=25&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=1011237&activetextdocid=1011254]</ref> invariably in predominantly nationalist districts, is resisted by unionists who claim that it creates a "chill factor" and thus harms community relationships. Efforts by members of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to legislate for some official uses of the language have failed to achieve the required cross-community support, and the UK government has declined to legislate. There has recently been an increase in interest in the language among unionists in East Belfast.<ref>{{cite news|last=Keenan|first=Dan|title=Loyalists line up to learn cúpla focail at language classes in heart of east Belfast|work=Irish Times|date=9 January 2014|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/loyalists-line-up-to-learn-c%C3%BApla-focail-at-language-classes-in-heart-of-east-belfast-1.1650239|access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref>

====Ulster Scots====

{{Main|Ulster Scots dialects}}

Ulster Scots comprises varieties of the [[Scots language]] spoken in Northern Ireland. For a native English speaker, "[Ulster Scots] is comparatively accessible, and even at its most intense can be understood fairly easily with the help of a glossary."<ref name = "Poilin-BBC">Aodan Mac Poilin, 1999, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/history/stateapart/agreement/culture/support/cul2_c011.shtml "Language, Identity and Politics in Northern Ireland"] in Ulster Folk Life Vol. 45, 1999</ref>

Along with the Irish language, the Good Friday Agreement recognised the dialect as part of Northern Ireland's unique culture and the [[St Andrews Agreement]] recognised the need to "enhance and develop the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/st_andrews_agreement.pdf |title=St Andrews Agreement |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104144328/http://www.nio.gov.uk/st_andrews_agreement.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2006}}&nbsp;{{small|(131&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>

Approximately 2% of the population claim to speak Ulster Scots.<ref>Northern Ireland LIFE & TIMES Survey: [http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/USPKULST.html Do you yourself speak Ulster-Scots?]</ref> However, the number speaking it as their main language in their home is negligible,<ref name = "Survey-NorthernIreland"/> with only 0.9% of 2011 census respondents claiming to be able to speak, read, write and understand Ulster-Scots. 8.1% professed to have "some ability" however.<ref name="Census 2011"/>

====Sign languages====

{{Main|Northern Ireland Sign Language|Irish Sign Language|British Sign Language}}

The most common [[sign language]] in Northern Ireland is [[Northern Ireland Sign Language]] (NISL). However, because in the past Catholic families tended to send their deaf children to schools in Dublin{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} where [[Irish Sign Language]] (ISL) is commonly used, ISL is still common among many older deaf people from Catholic families.

Irish Sign Language (ISL) has some influence from the French family of sign language, which includes [[American Sign Language]] (ASL). NISL takes a large component from the British family of sign language (which also includes [[Auslan]]) with many borrowings from ASL.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Northern Ireland}}
[[File:Ulster Covenant Commemoration Parade, Belfast, September 2012 (010).JPG|thumb|right|An [[Orange Order|Orange]] march]]
Northern Ireland shares both the [[culture of Ireland]] and the [[culture of the United Kingdom]].

[[Parades in Northern Ireland|Parades are a prominent feature]] of Northern Ireland society,<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/parade/summary.htm Parades and Marches – A Summary of the Issue]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).</ref> more so than in the rest of Ireland or in Britain. Most are held by Protestant fraternities such as the [[Orange Order]], and [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalist]] marching bands. Each summer, during the "marching season", these groups have hundreds of parades, [[Northern Ireland flags issue|deck streets with British flags]], bunting and specially-made arches, and light [[Eleventh Night|large towering bonfires]].<ref name=bryan130>Bryan, Dominic. ''Orange Parades: The Politics of Ritual, Tradition and Control''. Pluto Press, 2000. p. 130</ref> The biggest parades are held on 12 July ([[The Twelfth]]). There is often tension when these activities take place near Catholic neighbourhoods, which sometimes leads to violence.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25429676 "NI talks issues explained: flags, parades, the past and welfare reform"]. BBC News, 12 December 2014.</ref>

Since the end of the Troubles, Northern Ireland has witnessed rising numbers of tourists. Attractions include cultural festivals, musical and artistic traditions, countryside and geographical sites of interest, [[public house]]s, welcoming hospitality and sports (especially golf and fishing). Since 1987 [[public house]]s have been allowed to open on Sundays, despite some opposition.

The [[Ulster Cycle]] is a large body of prose and verse centring on the traditional heroes of the [[Ulaid]] in what is now eastern Ulster. This is one of the four major cycles of [[Irish mythology]]. The cycle centres on the reign of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]], who is said to have been king of Ulster around the 1st century. He ruled from [[Emain Macha]] (now Navan Fort near Armagh), and had a fierce rivalry with queen [[Medb]] and king Ailill of Connacht and their ally, [[Fergus mac Róich]], former king of Ulster. The foremost hero of the cycle is Conchobar's nephew [[Cúchulainn]], who features in the [[epic poetry|epic prose/poem]] ''An [[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' (The Cattle Raid of Cooley, a ''[[cassus belli]]'' between Ulster and [[Connaught]]).

Northern Ireland comprises a patchwork of communities whose national loyalties are represented in some areas by flags flown from flagpoles or lamp posts. The [[Union Jack]] and the former [[flag of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland flag]] are flown in many loyalist areas, and the Tricolour, adopted by republicans as the [[flag of Ireland]] in 1916,<ref>{{citation|title=Reactions To Irish Nationalism, 1865–1914|editor=Alan O'Day|publisher=Hambledon Press|location=London|year=1987|quote=With the Rising of 1916 a break took place in national symbolism which was most visibly manifested in the national flag and the anthem which the young Irish nation accepted. The demise of the Parliamentary Party stands in direct parallel to the just as rapidly diminishing power of its symbols. The green flag and 'God save Ireland' began to be discredited as symbols of constitutional nationalism and, instead, the symbols of revolutionary nationalism gained popularity as the majority of the Irish people identified itself with the political aims of the Easter revolutionaries. The use of symbols made apparent that the occurrences of 1916 initiated a new epoch in Irish history much in the same as the Union of 1801 and the Famine of 1845–8 did.<p>Both the national flag and the national anthem of present-day Ireland drive origins directly from the Rising. At first it still appeared as if the revolutionaries would take over the old symbols because on the roof of their headquarters, the Dublin General Post Office, a green flag with the harp was hoisted next to the republican tricolour although with the inscription 'Irish Republic'. Even 'Got save Ireland' was sung by the revolutionaries during Easter week. But after the failure of the Rising and the subsequent executions of the leading revolutionaries the tricolour and 'The Soldier's Song' became more and more popular as symbols of the rebellion.</p>}}</ref> is flown in some republican areas. Even [[curb (road)|kerbstones]] in some areas are painted red-white-blue or green-white-orange, depending on whether local people express unionist/loyalist or nationalist/republican sympathies.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7748005.stm Vandals curbed by plastic edging] BBC News, 25 November 2008.</ref>

The [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] and the [[Church of Ireland]] have used the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]] or "Cross of St&nbsp;Patrick". This red [[saltire]] on a white field was used to represent Ireland in the [[flag of the United Kingdom]]. It is still used by some [[British army]] regiments.

The United Kingdom [[national anthem]] of "[[God Save the Queen]]" is often played at state events in Northern Ireland. At the [[Commonwealth Games]] and some other sporting events, the Northern Ireland team uses the Ulster Banner as its flag—notwithstanding its lack of official status—and the ''[[Londonderry Air]]'' (usually set to [[lyrics]] as ''[[Danny Boy]]''), which also has no official status, as its [[national anthem]].<ref>''Sport, Nationalism and Globalization: European and North American Perspectives'' by Alan Bairner ({{ISBN|978-0791449127}}), p. 38</ref><ref>''Sport, Sectarianism and Society in a Divided Ireland'' by John Sugden and Alan Bairner ({{ISBN|978-0718500184}}), p60</ref> The [[Northern Ireland national football team|national football team]] also uses the Ulster Banner as its flag but uses "God Save The Queen" as its anthem.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/en/organisation/confederations/associationdetails/0,1483, NIR,00.html?countrycode=NIR |title=FIFA.com: Northern Ireland, Latest News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210203557/http://www.fifa.com/en/organisation/confederations/associationdetails/0%2C1483%2CNIR%2C00.html?countrycode=NIR |archive-date=10 December 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Sport==
{{Main|Sport in Northern Ireland}}

In Northern Ireland, sport is popular and important in the lives of many people. Sports tend to be organised on an [[all-Ireland]] basis, with a single team for the whole island.<ref name="theherald1">[http://www.heraldscotland.com/how-do-other-sports-in-the-island-cope-with-the-situation-1.877873 How do other sports in the island cope with the situation?] The Herald, 3 April 2008</ref> The most notable exception is association football, which has separate governing bodies for each jurisdiction.<ref name="theherald1"/>

===Field sports===

====Association football====

[[File:George best 1976.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Best]], [[People of Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] international footballer and 1968 [[Ballon d'Or]]]]

The [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA) serves as the organising body for association football in Northern Ireland, with the [[Northern Ireland Football League]] (NIFL) responsible for the independent administration of the three divisions of national domestic football, as well as the [[Northern Ireland Football League Cup]].

The highest level of competition within Northern Ireland are the [[NIFL Premiership]] and the [[NIFL Championship]]. However, many players from Northern Ireland compete with clubs in [[England]] and [[Scotland]].

NIFL clubs are [[semi-professional]] or Intermediate.[[NIFL Premiership]] clubs are also eligible to compete in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]] with the league champions entering the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions league]] second qualifying round and the 2nd placed league finisher, the European play-off winners and the [[Irish Cup]] winners entering the [[Europa League]] second qualifying round. No clubs have ever reached the group stage.

Despite Northern Ireland's small population, the [[Northern Ireland national football team|national team]] qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]], [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], making it to the quarter-finals in 1958 and 1982 and made it the first knockout round in the [[European Championships]] in 2016.

====Rugby union====

The six counties of Northern Ireland are among the nine governed by the [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster branch]] of the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]], the governing body of [[rugby union]] in Ireland.  Ulster is one of the four professional provincial teams in Ireland and competes in the [[Pro14]] and [[Heineken Cup|European Cup]]. It won the European Cup in 1999.

In international competitions, the [[Ireland national rugby union team]]'s recent successes include four [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]]s between 2004 and 2009 and a [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] in 2009 in the [[Six Nations Championship]].

====Cricket====

Northern Ireland plays as the [[Ireland cricket team]] which represents both Northern Ireland and [[Republic of Ireland]]. The Ireland Cricket team is a full member of the [[International Cricket Council]], having been granted [[Test cricket|Test status]] and full membership (along with [[Afghanistan cricket team|Afghanistan]]) by the ICC in June 2017. They are currently able to compete in Test cricket, the highest level of competitive cricket in the international arena and they are one of the twelve full-member countries under the ICC.

Ireland is the current champion of the [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]]. One of Ireland's regular international venues is [[Stormont (cricket ground)|Stormont]] in Belfast.[[File:Peter Canavan - SFC 2005 cc 3.0.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Peter Canavan]], [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] captain 2003]]

====Gaelic games====

Gaelic games include [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] (and [[camogie]]), [[Gaelic handball|handball]] and [[rounders]]. Of the four, football is the most popular in Northern Ireland.  Players play for local clubs with the best being selected for their county teams. The [[Ulster GAA]] is the branch of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] that is responsible for the nine counties of Ulster, which include the six of Northern Ireland.

These nine county teams participate in the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]], [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]], [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]].

Recent successes for Northern Ireland teams include [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]]'s 2002 [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] win and [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]]'s wins in 2003, 2005 and 2008.

===Golf===

Perhaps Northern Ireland's most notable successes in professional sport have come in golf. Northern Ireland has contributed more major champions in the modern era than any other European country, with three in the space of just 14 months from the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] in [[2010 U.S. Open (golf)|2010]] to [[The Open Championship]] in [[2011 Open Championship|2011]]. Notable golfers include [[Fred Daly (golfer)|Fred Daly]] (winner of The Open in [[1947 Open Championship|1947]]), [[Ryder Cup]] players [[Ronan Rafferty]] and [[David Feherty]], leading [[European Tour]] professionals [[David Jones (golfer)|David Jones]], [[Michael Hoey (golfer)|Michael Hoey]] (a five-time winner on the tour) and [[Gareth Maybin]], as well as three recent major winners [[Graeme McDowell]] (winner of the U.S. Open in 2010, the first European to do so since 1970), [[Rory McIlroy]] (winner of four [[Men's major golf championships|majors]]) and [[Darren Clarke]] (winner of The Open in 2011).<ref>{{cite news|work=Daily News |location=New York |title=Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell wins U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, ends European losing streak|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2010/06/20/2010-06-20_northern_irelands_graeme_mcdowell_wins_us_open_at_pebble_beach_ends_european_los.html#ixzz0sG74YZKd|last=Gagne|first=Matt|access-date=29 June 2010|date=20 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Lawrence Donegan at Congressional |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/20/rory-mcilroy-us-open |title=US Open 2011: Remarkable Rory McIlroy wins by eight shots &#124; Sport |work=The Guardian  |location=UK |access-date=23 August 2011 |date=20 June 2011}}</ref> Northern Ireland has also contributed several players to the Great Britain and Ireland [[Walker Cup]] team, including [[Alan Dunbar]] and Paul Cutler who played on the victorious 2011 team in Scotland. Dunbar also won [[The Amateur Championship]] in 2012, at Royal Troon.

The [[Golfing Union of Ireland]], the governing body for men's and boy's amateur golf throughout Ireland and the oldest golfing union in the world, was founded in Belfast in 1891. Northern Ireland's golf courses include the Royal Belfast Golf Club (the earliest, formed in 1881), [[Royal Portrush Golf Club]], which is the only course outside Great Britain to have hosted [[The Open Championship]], and [[Royal County Down Golf Club]] (''[[Golf Digest]]'' magazine's top-rated course outside the United States).<ref>{{cite book|last=Redmond|first=John|title=The Book of Irish Golf|page=10|publisher=Pelican Publishing Company|year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/golf-courses/golf-courses/2009-05/100greatestinternational_golfcourses?currentPage=2|access-date=21 June 2010|title=The Best of the Rest: A World of Great Golf|year=2009|publisher=Golf Digest|page=2}}</ref>

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Northern Ireland}}
[[File:Queen's University Belfast 2.jpg|thumb|right| [[Queen's University Belfast]]]]

Unlike most areas of the United Kingdom, in the last year of primary school, many children sit entrance examinations for [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar schools]].

[[Integrated Education|Integrated schools]], which attempt to ensure a balance in enrolment between pupils of Protestant, Roman Catholic and other faiths (or none), are becoming increasingly popular, although Northern Ireland still has a primarily ''de facto'' religiously segregated education system. In the primary school sector, 40 schools (8.9% of the total number) are integrated schools and 32 (7.2% of the total number) are [[Gaelscoileanna|Irish language-medium schools]].

The main universities in Northern Ireland are [[Queen's University Belfast]] and [[Ulster University]], and the distance learning [[Open University]] which has a regional office in Belfast.

==Wildlife==
356 species of marine [[algae]] have been recorded in the north-east of Ireland. As Counties Londonderry, Antrim and Down are the only three counties of Northern Ireland with a shoreline this will apply to all Northern Ireland. 77 species are considered rare having been recorded rarely.<ref>Morton, O. 1994.
