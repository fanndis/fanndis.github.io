==History==
''The Japan Times'' was launched by Motosada Zumoto on 22&nbsp;March 1897, with the goal of giving Japanese people an opportunity to read and discuss news and current events in [[English language|English]] to help Japan to participate in the international community.<ref name=Kamiya>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/08/13/national/japan-times-not-just-wartime-mouthpiece/ |title=Japan Times not just wartime mouthpiece |date=13 August 2011 |last=Kamiya |first=Setsuko |work=The Japan Times}}</ref> The newspaper was independent of government control, but from 1931 onward, the paper's editors experienced mounting pressure from the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] to submit to its policies. In 1933, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] appointed [[Hitoshi Ashida]], former ministry official, as chief editor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fccj.or.jp/node/2123 |title=The Japan Times at War Time: Mouth piece or Moderator? |first=Peter |last=O'Connor |date=4 April 2007 |publisher=[[Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan]] |website=fccj.or.jp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716064544/http://www.fccj.or.jp/node/2123 |archive-date=16 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], the newspaper served as an outlet for [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] government propaganda and editorial opinion.<ref name="Kamiya" /> It was successively renamed '''''The Japan Times and Mail''''' (1918–1940) following its merger with ''The Japan Mail'', '''''The Japan Times and Advertiser''''' (1940–1943) following its merger with ''The Japan Advertiser'', and '''''Nippon Times''''' (1943–1956), before reverting to the ''Japan Times'' title in 1956.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.library.yale.edu/news/2015/09/new-resource-available-japan-times-archives-1897-2014|title=New Resource Available: Japan Times Archives (1897-2014) {{!}} Yale University Library|website=web.library.yale.edu|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref> The temporary change to ''Nippon Times'' occurred during the ban on English language sentiment during World War II-era Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/02/24/national/history/wartime-naval-cadet-recalls-twisted-history-english-japan/ |title=Wartime naval cadet recalls the twisted history of English in Japan |last=Ishii |first=Hayato |date=24 February 2015 |work=The Japan Times |agency=[[Kyodo News]] |access-date=5 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226165141/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/02/24/national/history/wartime-naval-cadet-recalls-twisted-history-english-japan/ |archive-date=26 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Shintaro Fukushima ([[:ja:1907年|1907]]–[[:ja:1987年|1987]]) became president of ''The Japan Times'' in 1956. He sold some of the company's shares to Toshiaki Ogasawara  (小笠原 敏晶 ''Ogasawara Toshiaki''), who was chairman of Nifco, a manufacturer of automotive fasteners. Fukushima renounced management rights in 1983, after which Nifco acquired control of ''The Japan Times'' and brought about staff changes and alterations to the company's traditions established in 1897.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/4216?page=4|title=小野寺優・ニフコ社長--自動車用にとどまらず、工業用ファスナーを軸として切り口増やしたい|trans-title=Yu Onodera, President Nifco--I want to increase the number of cuts by using industrial fasteners as an axis, not only for automobiles|last=|first=|date=2010-04-26|website=toyokeizai.net|publisher=[[Toyo Keizai]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Ogasawara served as the chairman and publisher of ''The Japan Times'' until 2016,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/12/05/national/japan-times-honorary-chairman-former-publisher-toshiaki-ogasawara-dies-85/|title=Japan Times honorary chairman and former publisher Toshiaki Ogasawara dies at 85|date=5 December 2016|newspaper=Japan Times Online}}</ref> when his daughter Yukiko Ogasawara (小笠原 有輝子 ''Ogasawara Yukiko'') succeeded him as chairman of the company.

After being acquired by News2u, ''The Japan Times'' changed its editorial stance and contributor lineup as part of efforts to reduce criticism of the newspaper as an "anti-Japanese" outlet.<ref name=reuters2019>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-politics-newsroom-insight/fear-and-favor-chill-newsroom-at-storied-japanese-paper-idUSKCN1PI36V|title='Fear' and 'favor' chill newsroom at storied Japanese paper|work=[[Reuters]]|first1=Mari|last1=Saito|first2=Ami|last2=Miyazaki|date=24 January 2019|access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref> In November 2018, it was announced in an editor's note that subsequent articles would use the term "forced labor" rather than "wartime laborers", and the term "[[comfort women]]" would be replaced with "women who worked in wartime brothels, including those who did so against their will, to provide sex to Japanese soldiers".<ref name=jtterms>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/11/29/national/crime-legal/south-koreas-top-court-orders-mitsubishi-heavy-pay-compensation-wartime-labor/|title=South Korea's top court orders Mitsubishi Heavy to pay compensation for wartime labor|work=The Japan Times|date=29 November 2018|access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref> The change drew immediate criticism from readers and employees, with particular concerns expressed over the paper's apparent alignment with the political positions of Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]].<ref name=guardianterms>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/30/japanese-paper-sparks-anger-as-it-ditches-ww2-forced-labour-term|title='Comfort women': anger as Japan paper alters description of WWII terms|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Justin|last=McCurry|date=30 November 2018|access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref>
