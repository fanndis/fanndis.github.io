== Etymology ==
''Métairie'' ({{IPA-fr|me.tɛ.ʁi|lang}}) is the [[French language|French]] term for a small tenant farm which paid the landlord with a share of the produce, a practice also known as [[sharecropping]] (in French, ''[[métayage]]''). In the 1760s, many of the original French farmers were tenants; after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the majority of the community's inhabitants were sharecroppers until urbanization started in the 1910s.

== History ==
In the 1720s, French settlers became the first Europeans to settle Metairie in the area known then as Tchoupitoulas and now as Metairie Ridge, a natural levee formed by an ancient branch of the Mississippi River, [[Bayou Metairie]], which flowed through modern-day [[River Ridge, Louisiana|River Ridge]], Metairie, [[Gentilly, New Orleans|Gentilly]], and [[New Orleans East]]. It emptied into [[Mississippi Sound]]. The [[Acolapissa]] Native Americans used this ridge as a road; it is the oldest road in the New Orleans area. Paved in the 1920s, it is called Metairie Road. An electric [[streetcar]] was installed running along Metairie Road in the late 1910s, opening the area to greater development. Upscale housing tracts were constructed off the road in the 1920s; this area is now known as "Old Metairie". It is today the most prestigious area of Metairie. The areas to the north and northwest of Metairie Road were not developed until after [[World War II]]. The land between Metairie Ridge and [[Lake Pontchartrain]], which was [[bald cypress|cypress]] swamps and marshlands, was drained with the [[Wood Pump]]. With development of this new land for residences, Metairie's population grew in the 1940s as a result of cheaper land, lower taxes, and larger lots as compared to Orleans Parish.

The [[1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane]], with winds of {{convert|125|mph|abbr=on}}, directly hit Metairie. Much of the community was under {{convert|6|ft}} of water.

[[Hurricane Betsy]], a Category Three storm, hit the area in 1965, causing extensive wind damage and moderate flooding. In 1995 the [[May 8th 1995 Louisiana flood]], which dumped upwards of {{convert|20|in}} of rain into Metairie in a twelve-hour period, also flooded some parts of the region, especially areas south and west of Metairie, including Kenner, [[Harahan, Louisiana|Harahan]], and River Ridge.

In 1990, Metairie made history when one of its districts elected [[white supremacist]] [[David Duke]] to the Louisiana state legislature for a single term. On August 29, 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] caused a new migration from Orleans Parish, because housing was needed to replace what had been destroyed in the flooding of the city. It has been a racially neutral migration, with equal numbers of black and white residents moving to Jefferson Parish. The 2010 Census showed that Metairie has increasingly become more diverse.

Veterans Boulevard was laid out alongside a drainage [[canal]], and became a commercial center of the region. The [[central business district]] of Metairie is located on Causeway Boulevard near Lake Pontchartrain. Metairie also has one of the handful of major malls located in the New Orleans metro area. [[Lakeside Shopping Center]] is the highest-grossing mall in the New Orleans metropolitan area. In the 1970s and early 1980s, an area of [[bar]]s and [[nightclub]]s opened in a section of Metairie known as "Fat City", which is now the most racially diverse area in the New Orleans metropolitan area and is home to a vibrant restaurant scene. Several New Orleans radio and television stations have transmitter facilities in Metairie and Jefferson Parish; two of them, [[WGNO-TV]] and [[WNOL]], now have studios and main offices in Metairie.  Metairie has a large [[Mardi Gras]] season that touts itself as more family-friendly than the [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]].

==Geography==
Metairie is located in eastern [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] and is bordered by [[New Orleans]] to the east, [[Kenner, Louisiana|Kenner]] to the west, [[Lake Pontchartrain]] to the north, and the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] tracks to the south. South of the railroad are [[River Ridge, Louisiana|River Ridge]], Harahan, [[Elmwood, Louisiana|Elmwood]], and [[Jefferson, Louisiana|Jefferson]]. The [[17th Street Canal]] forms the border between Metairie and New Orleans to the east. It is a principal community in [[New Orleans metropolitan area|Greater New Orleans]]. According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the Metairie CDP has a total area of {{convert|60.2|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|60.1|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqkm|order=flip|2}}, or 0.18%, is water.<ref name="Census 2010" />

===Climate===
The climate of Metairie has been classified as [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]]. Like the city of New Orleans, it has short, generally mild winters and hot, humid summers. The average precipitation is {{convert|62.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} annually; the summer months are the wettest, while October is the driest month.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=lix|title=National Weather Service}}</ref> Precipitation in winter usually accompanies the passing of a cold front. On average, there are 77 days of {{convert|90|°F}} or greater highs, 8.1 days per winter where the high does not exceed {{convert|50|°F}}, and 8.0&nbsp;nights with freezing lows annually. It is rare for the temperature to reach {{convert|20|or|100|°F|°C|1}}, with the last occurrence of each being February 5, 1996 and June 26, 2016, respectively.<ref name=":0" />

==Infrastructure==
=== Transportation ===
[[Image:MetryJuly2008CausewayWestEsplanade.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two of the major roads in Metairie, Causeway Boulevard and West Esplanade Avenue, where they intersect in the CBD]]
The most common method of transportation within Metairie is the automobile. Mass transit is provided by "JeT" ([[Jefferson Transit (Louisiana)|Jefferson Transit]]), but it does not run on Sundays, holidays, or late at night, unlike many lines of New Orleans' RTA. JeT's coverage is also very limited in terms of usability.

[[Interstate 10]] runs east–west through Metairie.

Major east–west roads (starting from north to south) include West Esplanade Avenue, [[Veterans Memorial Boulevard]], West Napoleon Avenue, West Metairie Avenue, Metairie Road, Airline Drive (which is part of [[U.S. Route 61]]) and Jefferson Highway (which is part of [[U.S. Route 90]]). The [[Earhart Expressway]], running east–west immediately south of Airline Drive, is the only other freeway entering New Orleans from the west, but it ends as an expressway soon after crossing into Orleans Parish  and well before the New Orleans CBD (in Central City.)

For many of the major east–west roadways, the eastbound and westbound lanes are separated by large, open-topped drainage canals. These canals are one of the most distinct characteristics of the Metairie landscape.  Similar canals once bisected many streets in neighboring New Orleans, but most were covered over in the mid-20th century.

Multi-line, continuous north–south roads (starting from west to east) include Power Boulevard/David Drive/Hickory Avenue, Transcontinental Drive, Clearview Parkway, Causeway Boulevard, and Bonnabel Boulevard.

The [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]]'s southern terminus lies in Metairie.
