Various versions of the concept have developed over the centuries, many of which are mutually incompatible (inclusion or exclusion of the United Kingdom, secular or religious union, etc.).

=== 19th century ===
[[Felix Markham]] notes how during a conversation on St. Helena, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] remarked: "Europe thus divided into nationalities freely formed and free internally, peace between States would have become easier: the United States of Europe would become a possibility".<ref>Felix Markham, ''Napoleon'' (New York: Penguin Books USA Inc., 1966), 257 as quoted in Matthew Zarzeczny, ''Napoleon's European Union: The Grand Empire of the United States of Europe'' (Kent State University Master's thesis), 2.</ref> "United States of Europe" was also the name of the concept presented by [[Wojciech Jastrzębowski]] in ''About eternal peace between the nations'', published 31 May 1831. The project consisted of 77 articles. The envisioned United States of Europe was to be an international organisation rather than a superstate. [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], an early advocate of a "United States of Europe"  regarded the European unification as a logical continuation of the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]]. <ref>{{cite book|title=A Cosmopolitanism of Nations|first=Giuseppe|last=Mazzini|chapter=From a Revolutionary Alliance to the United States of Europe|pages=131–135|editor1=Steffano Reccia|editor2=Nadia Urbinati|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACLiOPrOW2kC}}
</ref> Mazzini created the [[Young Europe]] movement.

The term "United States of Europe" ({{lang-fr|États-Unis d'Europe}}) was used by [[Victor Hugo]], including during a speech at the [[International Peace Congress]] held in Paris in 1849.<ref>https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Congr%C3%A8s_de_la_Paix_1849</ref> Hugo favoured the creation of "a supreme, sovereign senate, which will be to Europe what parliament is to England" and said: "A day will come when all nations on our continent will form a European brotherhood ... A day will come when we shall see ... the United States of America and the United States of Europe face to face, reaching out for each other across the seas". Hugo planted a tree in the grounds of his residence on the Island of [[Guernsey]] and was noted in saying that when this tree matured the United States of Europe would have come into being. This tree to this day is still growing in the gardens of Maison de Hauteville, [[Saint Peter Port|St. Peter Port]], Guernsey, Victor Hugo's residence during his exile from France.

In 1867, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] joined Victor Hugo at a congress of the League for Peace and Freedom in [[Geneva]]. Here the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] stated: "That in order to achieve the triumph of liberty, justice and peace in the international relations of Europe, and to render civil war impossible among the various peoples who make up the European family, only a single course lies open: to constitute the United States of Europe".{{cn|date=January 2018}} The [[French National Assembly]] also called for a United States of Europe on 1 March 1871.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=dubious}}

Following the catastrophe of the [[First World War]], some thinkers and visionaries again began to float the idea of a politically unified Europe. In 1923, the Austrian Count [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]] founded the [[Paneuropean Union|Pan-Europa Movement]] and hosted the First Paneuropean Congress, held in [[Vienna]] in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jews Participate in Pan-europe Congress Sessions in Vienna|url=http://www.jta.org/1926/10/05/archive/jews-participate-in-pan-europe-congress-sessions-in-vienna|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=12 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409060558/http://www.jta.org/1926/10/05/archive/jews-participate-in-pan-europe-congress-sessions-in-vienna|archive-date=9 April 2017|location=Vienna|language=en|date=5 October 1926}}</ref> The aim was for a Europe based on the principles of [[liberalism]], [[Christianity]] and [[social responsibility]].<ref name="paneuropa.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.paneuropa.org/ |title=Internationale Paneuropa Union - Union Paneuropeénne Internationale - International Paneuropean Union<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=15 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215145537/http://www.paneuropa.org/ |archive-date=15 February 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Before the [[October Revolution|communist revolution]] in Russia, [[Leon Trotsky]] foresaw a "Federated Republic of Europe — the United States of Europe", created by the [[proletariat]].<ref>John Reed, "Ten Days That Shook The World", Boni & Liveright, New York, (March 1919) ch. 3.</ref>

In 1929, [[Aristide Briand]], [[French Prime Minister]], gave a speech before the Assembly of the [[League of Nations]] in which he proposed the idea of a federation of European nations based on solidarity and in the pursuit of economic prosperity and political and social co-operation.{{cn|date=January 2018}} At the League's request, Briand presented a "Memorandum on the organisation of a system of European Federal Union" in 1930.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In 1931, French politician [[Édouard Herriot]] and British civil servant [[Arthur Salter, 1st Baron Salter|Arthur Salter]] both penned books titled ''The United States of Europe''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=ISBNs please}}
After the First World War, [[Winston Churchill]] had seen continental Europe as a source of threats and sought to avoid Britain's involvement in European conflicts. On 15 February 1930, Churchill commented in the American journal ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' that a "European Union" was possible between continental states, but without Britain's involvement: {{quote|We see nothing but good and hope in a richer, freer, more contented European commonality.

During the 1930s, Churchill was influenced by and became an advocate of the ideas of [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]] and his [[Paneuropean Union]],{{cn|date=January 2018}} though Churchill did not advocate Britain's membership of such a union. (Churchill revisited the idea in 1946).

During the World War II victories of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] stated that "the hand of God is creating a new world & working miracles. ... We are becoming the United States of Europe under German leadership, a united European Continent".<ref>Jonathan Petropoulos, ''Royals and the Reich'', Oxford University Press (2006) p. 170</ref>

In 1941, the Italian anti-fascists [[Altiero Spinelli]] and [[Ernesto Rossi (politician)|Ernesto Rossi]] finished writing the [[Ventotene Manifesto]], encouraging a federation of European states.<ref>Bertrand Vayssière,  "Le Manifeste de Ventotene (1941): Acte de Naissance du Federalisme Europeen," ''Guerres Mondiales et Conflits Contemporains'' (Jan 2005), Vol. 55 Issue 217</ref>

=== Post World War II ===
Churchill used the term "United States of Europe" in a speech delivered on 19 September 1946 at the [[University of Zurich]], Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/AboutUs/zurich_e.htm|title=Speech of Sir Winston Churchill|date=19 September 1946|website=PACE website|publisher=[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]|location=Zürich, Switzerland|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218054245/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/AboutUs/zurich_e.htm|archive-date=18 February 2013|access-date=18 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In this speech given after the end of the Second World War, Churchill concluded: {{quote|We must build a kind of United States of Europe.

Churchill's was a more cautious approach ("the unionist position") to European integration than was the continental approach that was known as "the federalist position".<ref name="D. Dinan 2005. pages 14–15">D. Dinan, 2005. Ever Closer Union, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|1-58826-234-0}}. pages 14–15.</ref> The Federalists advocated full integration with a constitution, while the Unionist United Europe Movement advocated a consultative body and the Federalists prevailed at the Congress of Europe.<ref name="D.

Ever Closer Union, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|1-58826-234-0}}. page 15.</ref>

The [[Union Movement]] was a British party founded by [[Oswald Mosley]] after the dissolution of his [[British Union of Fascists]].  Mosley first presented his idea of "[[Europe a Nation]]" in his book ''The Alternative'' in 1947.
He argued that the traditional vision of nationalism that had been followed by the various shades of pre-war fascism had been too narrow in scope and that the post-war era required a new paradigm in which Europe would come together as a single state. In October 1948 when Mosley called for elections to a European Assembly as the first step towards his vision.<ref name="Harris31">Harris, Geoffrey, ''The Dark Side of Europe: The Extreme Right Today'', Edinburgh University Press, 1994, p. 31</ref>
''[[Nation Europa]]'' was a German magazine inspired by Mosley's ideas, founded in 1951 by former [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] commander [[Arthur Ehrhardt]] and [[Herbert Boehme]] with the support of  [[Carl-Ehrenfried Carlberg]].<ref>[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', p. 54</ref> 

By the 1950s and 1960s, Europe saw the emergence of two different projects, the [[European Free Trade Association]] and the much more political [[European Economic Community]].

===Early 21st century===
Individuals such as the former [[German Foreign Minister]] [[Joschka Fischer]] have said (in 2000) that he believes that the EU must in the end become a single [[federation]], with its political leader chosen by direct elections among all of its citizens.<ref name="BBC European Superstate">{{cite news|last1=Horsley|first1=William|title=Fears of a European superstate|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1058155.stm|access-date=29 January 2016|work=BBC News|date=7 December 2000}}</ref> However, claims that the (then) proposed [[Treaty of Nice]] aimed to create a "European superstate" were rejected by former United Kingdom [[European Commissioner]] [[Chris Patten]] and by many member-state governments.<ref name="BBC European Superstate" /> ({{As of|2018}}, the post "[[President of the European Union]]" does not exist, nor are there any plans that it should do so).

== Proposals for closer union ==
The [[Member state of the European Union|member states of the European Union]] do have many common policies within the EU and on behalf of the EU that are sometimes suggestive of a single state. It has a common executive (the [[European Commission]]), a single [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]], a common [[European Security and Defence Policy]], a supreme court ([[European Court of Justice]]{{spaced ndash}}but only in matters of [[European Union law]]) and an intergovernmental research organisation (the EIROforum with members like [[CERN]]). The [[euro]] is often referred to as the "single European currency", which has been officially adopted by nineteen [[Eurozone|EU countries]] while seven other member countries of the European Union have linked their currencies to the euro in [[ERM II]]. In addition, a number of European territories outside the EU have adopted the euro unofficially such as [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], the [[Vatican City]] and [[Andorra]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Several pan-European institutions exist separate from the EU. The [[European Space Agency]] counts almost all the EU member nations in its membership, but it is independent of the EU and its membership includes nations that are not EU members, notably Switzerland and Norway. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (not to be confused with the European Court of Justice) is also independent of the EU. It is an element of the [[Council of Europe]], which like ESA counts EU members and non-members alike in its membership.

At present, the European Union is a free association of sovereign states designed to further their shared aims.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Other than the vague aim of "ever closer union" in the [[Solemn Declaration on European Union]], the EU (meaning its member governments) has no current policy to create either a federation or a confederation. However, in the past [[Jean Monnet]], a person associated with the EU and its predecessor the [[European Economic Community]], did make such proposals. A wide range of other terms are in use to describe the possible future political structure of Europe as a whole and/or the EU. Some of them, such as "United Europe", are used often and in such varied contexts, but they have no definite constitutional status.

In the United States of America, the concept enters serious discussions of whether a unified Europe is feasible and what impact increased European unity would have on the United States of America's relative political and economic power. Glyn Morgan, a [[Harvard University]] associate professor of government and social studies, uses it unapologetically in the title of his book ''The Idea of a European Superstate: Public Justification and European Integration.'' While Morgan's text focuses on the security implications of a unified Europe, a number of other recent texts focus on the economic implications of such an entity. Important recent texts here include [[T. R. Reid]]'s ''The United States of Europe'' and [[Jeremy Rifkin]]'s ''The European Dream.'' Neither the ''[[National Review]]'' nor the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' doubt the appropriateness of the term in their reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/ramosmrosovsky200412200804.asp|title=Carlos Ramos-Mrosovsky on United States of Europe on National Review Online|access-date=2 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029005255/http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/ramosmrosovsky200412200804.asp|archive-date=29 October 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://chronicle.com/free/v51/i44/44a01201.htm Making the Case for a United States of Europe - Research - The Chronicle of Higher Education<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== European federalist organisations ===
Various federalist organisations have been created over time supporting the idea of a federal Europe. These include the [[Union of European Federalists]], the [[European Movement International]], the (former) [[European Federalist Party]] and [[Stand Up For Europe]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==== Union of European Federalists ====
The [[Union of European Federalists]] (UEF) is a European non-governmental organisation campaigning for a Federal Europe. It consists of 20 constituent organisations and it has been active at the European, national and local levels for more than 50 years. A young branch called the [[Young European Federalists]] also exists in 30 countries of Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==== European Movement International ====
The [[European Movement International]] is a lobbying association that coordinates the efforts of associations and national councils with the goal of promoting European integration, and disseminating information about it.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==== European Federalist Party ====
The [[European Federalist Party]] was a pro-European, pan-European and federalist political party from 2011 to 2016 which advocated further integration of the European Union.

==== Stand Up for Europe ====
As the successor movement of the [[European Federalist Party]], [[Stand Up For Europe]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Website of Stand Up for Europe|url=https://www.standupforeurope.eu/|website=Stand Up for Europe|access-date=2 February 2018}}</ref> is a pan-European NGO that advocates the foundation of a European Federation. Contrary to movements like the UEF or the former EFP, Stand Up for Europe does not command any national levels anymore, but only consists of regional city teams and the European level.

==== Volt Europa ====
[[Volt Europa]] is a pan-European, progressive movement that stands for a new and inclusive way of doing politics and that wants to bring change for European citizens.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.volteuropa.org/about|title=About us|work=Volt|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref> The party claims that a new pan-European approach is needed to overcome current and future challenges, such as - among others - climate change, economic inequality, migration, international conflict, terrorism, and the impact of the technological revolution on jobs. Volt says that national parties are powerless in front of these challenges, because they go beyond national borders and need to be tackled by Europeans, as one people. As a transnational party, it believes it can help the European people unite, create a shared vision and understanding, exchange good practices across the continent, and come up with working policies.

=== Politicians ===
==== Guy Verhofstadt ====
Following the negative referendums about the [[European Constitution]] in France and the [[Netherlands]], the former Belgian prime minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]] released in November 2005 his book, written in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Verenigde Staten van Europa'' ("United States of Europe") in which he claims – based on the results of a [[Eurobarometer]] questionnaire – that the average European citizen wants more Europe. He thinks a federal Europe should be created between those states that wish to have a federal Europe (as a form of enhanced cooperation). In other words, a core federal Europe would exist within the current EU. He also states that these core states should federalise the following five policy areas: a European social-economic policy, technology cooperation, a common justice and security policy, a common diplomacy and a [[European army]]. Following the ratification of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] (December 2009) by all member states of the EU, the outline of a common diplomatic service, known as the [[External Action Service of the European Union|External Action Service of the European Union (EEAS)]], was set in place. On 20 February 2009, the [[European Parliament]] also voted in favour of the creation of [[Synchronised Armed Forces Europe|Synchronised Armed Forces Europe (SAFE)]] as a first step towards a forming a true European military force.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/4689736/Blueprint-for-EU-army-to-be-agreed.html|title=Blueprint for EU army to be agreed|author=Bruno Waterfield in Brussels|date=18 February 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=30 December 2014}}</ref> 

Verhofstadt's book was awarded the first [[Europe Book Prize]], which is organised by the association Esprit d'Europe and supported by former [[President of the European Commission]] [[Jacques Delors]]. The prize money was €20,000. The prize was declared at the European Parliament in Brussels on 5 December 2007. Swedish crime fiction writer Henning Mankell was the president of the jury of European journalists for choosing the first recipient.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

While receiving the reward, Verhofstadt said: "When I wrote this book, I in fact meant it as a provocation against all those who didn't want the European Constitution. Fortunately, in the end a solution was found with the treaty, that was approved".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=europa&article=457865&lng=1|title=International news - euronews, latest international news|access-date=30 December 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206143409/http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=europa&article=457865&lng=1|archive-date=6 February 2012}}</ref>

==== Viviane Reding ====

==== Martin Schulz ====
In December 2017, [[Martin Schulz]], who was then the new leader of the German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], called for a new constitutional treaty for a "United States of Europe".<ref name=Schulz>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/martin-schulz-united-states-of-europe-germany-sdp  Martin Schulz wants 'United States of Europe' within five years ] - [[The Guardian]], 7 December 2017</ref>  He proposed that this constitution should be written by "a convention that includes civil society and the people" and that any state that declined to accept this proposed constitution should have to leave the bloc.<ref name=Schulz/> [[The Guardian]]'s view was that his proposal was "likely to be met with some resistance from [[Angela Merkel]] and other EU leaders".<ref name=Schulz /> On that day he also stated that he would like to see a "United States of Europe" by 2025.<ref name="Martin Schulz">[https://www.politico.eu/article/spds-martin-schulz-wants-united-states-of-europe-by-2025/ SPD's Martin Schulz wants United States of Europe by 2025 ] - [[Politico]], 7 December 2017</ref>

In his work he put forward the idea of creating the United States of Europe as a confederation of 75 states that would be formed according to an ethnic and linguistic principle with a population of 5 to 10 million people.<ref name="Tuesday Map: Heineken's „Eurotopia“">{{cite news|last1=Keating|first1=Joshua|title=Tuesday Map: Heineken's "Eurotopia"|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/05/26/tuesday-map-heinekens-eurotopia/|access-date=26 May 2009|work=Foreign Policy|date=1992}}</ref>

=== Future superpower ===
{{main article|Potential superpowers}}
The United States of Europe is widely hypothesized, fictionalised or depicted as a superpower that is as powerful as, or more powerful than, the United States of America. Some people, such as [[T.R. Reid]], Andrew Reding and [[Mark Leonard (writer)|Mark Leonard]], believe that the power of the hypothetical United States of Europe will rival that of the United States of America in the twenty-first century. Leonard cites seven factors: [[demographics of Europe|Europe's large population]], [[economy of Europe|Europe's large economy]], Europe's low inflation rates, Europe's central location in the world, the unpopularity and perceived failure of [[foreign relations of the United States|American foreign policy]] in recent years and certain European countries' highly developed [[social organisation]] and [[quality of life]] (when measured in terms such as hours worked per week and income distribution).<ref>[http://www.cer.org.uk/in-the-press/europe-new-superpower Europe: the new superpower by Mark Leonard], ''Irish Times'', Accessed 13 March 2014</ref> Some experts{{who|date=January 2016}} claim that Europe has developed a sphere of influence called the "[[Eurosphere]]".

=== Skepticisms ===
Some people think that the European Union is unlikely to evolve into a unified federal superstate, due to political opposition of some members. Norwegian foreign policy scholar and commentator [[Asle Toje]] has argued that the power and reach of the European Union more closely resembles a [[small power]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=396412|title=The European Union as a Small Power|access-date=30 December 2014}}</ref> In his book ''The EU As a Small Power'', he argues that the EU is a response to and function of Europe's unique historical experience in that the EU contains the remnants of not one but five past European orders. Although the 1990s and early 2000s have shown that there is policy space for greater EU engagement in European security, the EU has been unable to meet these expectations.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/84efd5fe-bc55-11df-a42b-00144feab49a,s01=1.html Europe heads for Japanese irrelevance] ''Financial Times''</ref>

Asle Toje expresses particular concerns over the EU's security and defence dimension [[Common Security and Defence Policy]], where attempts at pooling resources and forming a political consensus have failed to generate the results expected. These trends, combined with shifts in global power patterns, are seen to have been accompanied by a shift in EU strategic thinking whereby [[great power]] ambitions have been scaled down and replaced by a tendency towards hedging ''vis-à-vis'' the great powers. The author uses the case of the [[Military operations of the European Union|EUFOR]] intervention in [[Darfur]] and [[Chad]] to illustrate that the EU's effectiveness is hampered by a [[consensus–expectations gap]], owing primarily to the lack of an effective decision-making mechanism. In his view, the sum of these developments is that the EU – in the current situation – will not be a great power and is taking the place of a small power in the emerging multi-polar international order.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

=== Opposition ===
The European Union does not include every nation in Europe and there is no consensus among the existing member state governments towards becoming even a loose [[confederation]]. Specifically, the term "United States of Europe" – as a direct comparison with the [[United States of America]] – would imply that each of the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European states]] would acquire [[States' rights|a status similar]] to that of a [[U.S. state]], becoming constituent parts of a European federation acting as one sovereign country.

At the end of January 2020, the [[Brexit|United Kingdom left]] the European Union.

=== Polls ===
[[File:EU members where more people in favor of the European Federation.png|thumb|Attitude toward further development of the EU into a federation of nation states according to the [[Eurobarometer]] Poll of spring 2014.<br/>{{legend|#0e5e1b|border=1px solid #666|EU members with more people in favour of a federation than against it}}]]
According to [[Eurobarometer]] (2013), 69% of citizens of the EU were in favour of [[direct election]]s of the [[President of the European Commission]] and 46%  support the creation of a united EU army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-321_en.htm |title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - Making the European elections more democratic and boosting participation – Ground is prepared, say two Commission reports |publisher=Europa.eu |access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref>

Two thirds of respondents think that the EU (instead of a national government alone) should make decisions on foreign policy and more than half of respondents think that the EU should also make decisions on defense.<ref>http://www.reconproject.eu/main.php/RECON_wp_1119.pdf?fileitem=50512030</ref>

44% of respondents support the future development of the European Union as a federation of nation states, 35% are opposed. The Nordic countries were the most negative towards a united Europe in this study, as 73% of the Nordics opposed the idea.<ref name="europa1">[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb79/eb79_publ_en.pdf Standard Eurobarometer 79 Spring 2013]</ref> A large majority of the people for whom the EU conjures up a positive image support the further development of the EU into a federation of nation states (56% versus 27%).<ref name="europa1"/>

== Fiction ==
{{sources|section|date=October 2018}}
In ''[[The Old Earth]]'', the third volume (1911) of [[Jerzy Żuławski]]'s ''[[The Lunar Trilogy]]'', the USE is a communist tyranny.

In the [[fictional universe]] of [[Eric Flint]]'s best selling [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] [[1632 series|''1632'' series]], a United States of Europe is formed out of the Confederation of Principalities of Europe, which was composed of several German political units of the 1630s.<ref name=1632series>{{Cite book|title=[[1632 (novel)|1632]]|date=1 November 2002|page=655|edition=trade paperback (July 2003)|quote=President of the United States, Prime Minister of the United States of Europe}}</ref>

Science fiction has made particular use of the idea: ''[[Incompetence (book)|Incompetence]]'', a [[dystopian]] novel by [[Red Dwarf]] creator [[Rob Grant]], is a [[murder mystery]] [[political thriller]] set in a federated Europe of the near future, where stupidity is a constitutionally protected right. References to a European Alliance or European Hegemony have also existed in episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1987–1994). In the ''[[Spy High]]'' series of books for young adults, written by [[A. J. Butcher]] and set around the 2060s, a united Europe exists in the form of "Europa", and [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]]'s 1995 book ''[[The Aachen Memorandum]]'' details a United States of Europe formed from a fraudulent referendum entitled the Aachen Referendum.<ref>Roberts, Andrew (1995). ''The Aachen Memorandum''. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. {{ISBN|9780297816195}}</ref>

Since the 2000s a number of [[computer strategy game]]s set in the future have presented a unified European faction alongside other established military powers such as the United States and Russia. These include [[Battlefield 2#Euro Force|''Euro Force'']] (a 2006 expansion pack to ''[[Battlefield 2]]'') and ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'' (also released in 2006, with a 2007 expansion pack). In ''Battlefield 2142'' a united Europe is shown as one of the two great superpowers on Earth, the other being Asia, despite being mostly frozen in a new [[ice age]]. The disaster theme continues with ''[[Tom Clancy's EndWar]]'' (2009), in which a nuclear war between [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], destroying the Middle Eastern oil supply, prompts the EU to integrate further as the "European Federation" in 2018. One game not to make bold claims of full integration is ''[[Shattered Union]]'' (2005), set in a future civil war in the United States, with the EU portrayed as a peacekeeping force. The video game series [[Wipeout (video game series)|''Wipeout'']] instead makes a clear federal reference without a military element: one of the core teams that has appeared in every game is FEISAR. This [[acronym]] stands for Federal European Industrial Science and Research. In the video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' set in the 22nd century, the European Union is a sovereign state.

In the backstory of the [[Fallout (video game)|''Fallout'']] series, several European nations joined together after the end of the Second World War, becoming known as the European Commonwealth. Heavily dependent on oil imports from the Middle East, the Commonwealth began a military invasion of the region in April 2052 once oil supplies began to run dry. This marked the beginning of the Resource Wars. After the oil dried up completely in 2060 and both sides were left in ruins, the Commonwealth collapsed into civil war as member states fought over whatever resources remained. It is not specified whether the European Commonwealth is a single federated nation or just an economic bloc similar to the EU.
