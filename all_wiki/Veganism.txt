Pure vegetarians may use animal products, support the use of animals in research, wear leather clothing, or have no objection to the exploitation of animals for entertainment. They are mostly motivated by personal health concerns rather than by ethical objections.

===''Vegetarian'' etymology===
The term "vegetarian" has been in use since around 1839 to refer to what was previously described as a vegetable regimen or diet.<ref>Rod Preece, ''Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought'', Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uMnubkF5HjAC&pg=PA12 12].</ref> Its origin is an irregular compound of ''[[vegetable]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vegetable|title=Definition of VEGETABLE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref> and the suffix ''[[wikt:-arian|-arian]]'' (in the sense of "supporter, believer" as in ''[[wikt:humanitarian|humanitarian]]'').<ref name="VegetusMyth">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vegsource.com/john-davis/the-vegetus-myth.html|title=The Vegetus Myth|last=Davis|first=John|date=1 June 2011|website=VegSource|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318213259/https://www.vegsource.com/john-davis/the-vegetus-myth.html|archive-date=18 March 2018|url-status=live|access-date=18 March 2018|quote=Vegetarian can equally be seen as derived from the late Latin '{{lang|la|vegetabile}}' – meaning plant – as in {{lang|la|Regnum Vegetabile}} / Plant Kingdom. Hence vegetable, vegetation – and vegetarian. Though others suggest that 'vegetable' itself is derived from 'vegetus'. But it's very unlikely that the originators went through all that either – they really did just join 'vegetable+arian', as the dictionaries have said all along.}}</ref> The earliest known written use is attributed to actress, writer and [[abolitionist]] [[Fanny Kemble]], in her ''Journal of a Residence on a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgian]] [[plantation]] in 1838–1839''.{{efn|Fanny Kemble (''Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839'', 1839): "The sight and smell of raw meat are especially odious to me, and I have often thought that if I had had to be my own cook, I should inevitably become a vegetarian, probably, indeed, return entirely to my green and salad days."<ref>Fanny Kemble, ''Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839'', Harper and Brothers, New York, 1863, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WaFiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA197 197–198].</ref>{{pb}}
Another early use was by the editor of ''The Healthian'', a journal published by [[Alcott House]], in April 1942: "To tell a man, who is in the stocks for a given fault, that he cannot be so confined for such an offence, is ridiculous enough; but not more so than to tell a healthy vegetarian that his diet is very uncongenial with the wants of his nature, and contrary to reason."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100709210135/http://www.ivu.org/history/england19a/healthian.pdf ''The Healthian''], 1(5), April 1842, 34–35.{{pb}}

While vegans broadly abstain from animal products, there are many ways in which animal products are used, and different individuals and organizations that identify with the practice of veganism may use some limited animal products based on philosophy, means or other concerns.
Philosopher [[Gary Steiner]] argues that it is not possible to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are "deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society".<ref>Gary Steiner, ''Animals and the Limits of Postmodernism'', New York: Columbia University Press, 2013, 127–128.</ref>

===Meat, eggs and dairy===

[[File:Animal Abuse Battery Cage 02.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph of farm hens in battery cages|Modern methods of factory farming are considered highly unethical by most vegans.]]

Like [[vegetarians]] vegans do not eat meat (including [[beef]], [[pork]], [[poultry]], [[fowl]], [[Game (hunting)|game]], animal [[seafood]]).  The main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products and eggs. Ethical vegans avoid them on the premise that their production causes animal suffering and premature death. In egg production, most male [[Chick culling|chicks are culled]] because they do not lay eggs.<ref name=egg>{{cite book |first1=S. |last1=Aerts |first2=R. |last2=Boonen |first3=V. |last3=Bruggeman |first4=J. |last4=De Tavernier |first5=E. |last5=Decuypere |chapter=Culling of day-old chicks: opening the debates of Moria |pages=117–122 |chapter-url={{Google books|cFwbq035LsQC|page=117|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Kate |editor1-last=Millar |editor2-first=Pru Hobson |editor2-last=West |editor3-first=Brigitte |editor3-last=Nerlich |title=Ethical futures: bioscience and food horizons: Bioscience and Food Horizons : EurSafe 2009, Nottingham, United Kingdom, 2-4 July 2009 |date=2009 |publisher=Wageningen Academic Publishers |isbn=978-90-8686-115-6 }}</ref> To obtain milk from [[dairy cattle]], cows are made pregnant to induce [[lactation]]; they are kept lactating for three to seven years, then slaughtered.

===Clothing===

Many clothing products may be made of animal products such as [[silk]], [[wool]] (including [[lambswool]], [[shearling]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]], [[Angora wool|angora]], [[mohair]], and a number of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, [[leather]], snakeskin, or other kinds of skin or animal product.  While dietary vegans might use animal products in clothing, toiletries, and similar, ethical veganism extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or use of animal products, and rejects the [[commodification]] of animals altogether.<ref name="Francione2010"/>{{rp|62|quote=[Gary L. Francione:] Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or lifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political commitment to abolition on the individual level and extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical veganism is the personal rejection of the commodity status of nonhuman animals, of the notion that animals have only external value, and of the notion that animals have less moral value than do humans.}}  Most leather clothing is made from cow skins.

[[File:Oliiviöljysaippua.JPG|thumb|left|alt=photograph of vegan soap bar|[[Vegan soap]] made from [[olive oil]]; soap is usually made from [[tallow]] (animal fat).]]

Vegans replace [[personal care]] products and [[household cleaner]]s containing animal products with products that are vegan, such as vegan [[dental floss]] made of [[bamboo]] fiber. Animal ingredients are ubiquitous because they are relatively inexpensive. After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers are put through a [[Rendering (animals)|rendering]] process and some of that material, particularly the fat, is used in toiletries.

Common animal-derived ingredients include: [[tallow]] in soap; [[collagen]]-derived [[glycerine]], which used as a lubricant and [[humectant]] in many haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foams, soaps and toothpastes;<ref name=toiletries/> [[lanolin]] from sheep's wool is often found in lip balm and moisturizers; [[stearic acid]] is a common ingredient in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos, (as with glycerine, it can be plant-based, but is usually animal-derived); [[Lactic acid]], an [[alpha-hydroxy acid]] derived from animal milk, is used in moisturizers; [[allantoin]]— from the [[comfrey]] plant or cows' urine —is found in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste;<ref name=toiletries>''Animal Ingredients A to Z'', E.

A 2007 report based on the Oxford cohort of the [[European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition]], which began in 1993, suggested that vegans have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, likely because of lower dietary calcium intake. The study found that vegans consuming at least 525&nbsp;mg of calcium daily have a risk of fractures similar to that of other groups.{{efn|Appleby et al. (''[[European Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]'', 2007): "We observed similar fracture rates among meat eaters, fish eaters and vegetarians. A 30% higher fracture rate among vegans compared with meat eaters was halved in magnitude by adjustment for energy and calcium intake and disappeared altogether when the analysis was restricted to subjects who consumed at least 525 mg/day calcium, a quantity equal to the UK EAR.&nbsp;... In conclusion, fracture risk was similar for meat eaters, fish eaters and vegetarians in this study. The higher fracture risk among vegans appeared to be a consequence of their considerably lower mean calcium intake. Vegans, who do not consume dairy products, a major source of calcium in most diets, should ensure that they obtain adequate calcium from suitable sources such as almonds, sesame seeds, tahini (sesame paste), calcium-set tofu, calcium-fortified drinks and low-oxalate leafy green vegetables such as kale&nbsp;..."<ref name=EPICFeb2007>{{cite journal |last1=Appleby |first1=P |last2=Roddam |first2=A |last3=Allen |first3=N |last4=Key |first4=T |title=Comparative fracture risk in vegetarians and nonvegetarians in EPIC-Oxford |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition |date=7 February 2007 |volume=61 |issue=12 |pages=1400–1406 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602659 |pmid=17299475 |doi-access=free }}</ref>{{pb}}

====Vitamin D====
{{Further|Vitamin D deficiency|Rickets|Hypervitaminosis D}}

[[Vitamin D]] (calciferol) is needed for several functions, including calcium absorption, enabling mineralization of bone, and bone growth. Without it bones can become thin and brittle; together with calcium it offers protection against [[osteoporosis]]. Vitamin D is produced in the body when ultraviolet rays from the sun hit the skin; outdoor exposure is needed because [[UVB]] radiation does not penetrate glass. It is present in [[salmon]], [[tuna]], [[mackerel]] and [[cod liver oil]], with small amounts in cheese, egg yolks, and beef liver, and in some [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]].<ref name=VitD-NIH>[http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/ "Vitamin D"], Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health; Mangels et al. 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA204 204–209]; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13050 Ross et al. (Institute of Medicine) 2011], 75–124.</ref>

Most vegan diets contain little or no vitamin D without fortified food. People with little sun exposure may need supplements. The extent to which sun exposure is sufficient depends on the season, time of day, cloud and smog cover, skin [[melanin]] content, and whether [[sunscreen]] is worn. According to the [[National Institutes of Health]], most people can obtain and store sufficient vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer, and fall, even in the far north. They report that some researchers recommend 5–30 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen between 10 am and 3 pm, at least twice a week. [[Tanning bed]]s emitting 2–6% UVB radiation have a similar effect, though tanning is inadvisable.<ref name=VitD-NIH/><ref>Mangels et al. 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eJ10HoYQ2woC&pg=PA207 207–208]; [http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h8 "Vitamin D: Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin D"], Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health.</ref>

Vitamin D comes in two forms. [[Cholecalciferol]] (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) is synthesized in the skin after exposure to the sun or consumed from food, usually from animal sources. [[Ergocalciferol]] (vitamin D<sub>2</sub>) is derived from [[ergosterol]] from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. When produced industrially as supplements, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is typically derived from [[lanolin]] in sheep's wool. However, both [[provitamin]]s and vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> have been discovered in {{lang|la|[[Cladina]]}} spp. (especially {{lang|la|[[Cladina rangiferina]]}})<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Ting|last2=Bengtsson|first2=Göran|last3=Kärnefelt|first3=Ingvar|last4=Björn|first4=Lars Olof|date=1 September 2001|title=Provitamins and vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> in ''Cladina'' spp. over a latitudinal gradient: possible correlation with UV levels|url=https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/4763528/624375.pdf|access-date=22 March 2018|journal=[[Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology]]|volume=62|issue=1–2|pages=118–122|doi=10.1016/S1011-1344(01)00160-9|pmid=11693362|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322234902/https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/4763528/624375.pdf|archive-date=22 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and these [[edible lichen]] are harvested in the wild for producing vegan vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.<ref name=lichenD3>{{Cite news|last=Watson|first=Elaine|date=13 March 2012|title=Veggie vitamin D3 maker explores novel production process to secure future supplies|url=https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2012/03/13/Veggie-vitamin-D3-maker-explores-novel-production-process-to-secure-future-supplies|url-status=live|work=NutraIngredients-USA|publisher=[[William Reed Business Media]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322234242/https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2012/03/13/Veggie-vitamin-D3-maker-explores-novel-production-process-to-secure-future-supplies|archive-date=22 March 2018|access-date=22 March 2018|quote=The D3 is currently wild harvested from lichen that grows on rocks, trees and other locations in North America, Asia and Scandinavia [...] It is collected in buckets and washed at source, and then put through a multi-step process of extraction (using ethanol), purification and concentration in the UK before it is added to a [[vegetable oil]] carrier ([[medium chain triglyceride]]s).

===Ethical veganism===

[[File:Hog confinement barn interior.jpg|thumb|left|alt=photograph of pigs in barn|Pigs, as well as chicken and cattle, often have their movement restricted]]
Ethical veganism, also known as moral vegetarianism, is based on opposition to [[speciesism]], the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of (animal) species membership alone. Divisions within [[animal rights]] theory include the [[Animal rights#Utilitarian approach|utilitarian]], [[Animal protectionism|protectionist]] approach, which pursues improved conditions for animals. It also pertains to the rights-based [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]], which seeks to end human ownership of non-humans, including as pets. Abolitionists argue that protectionism serves only to make the public feel that animal use can be morally unproblematic (the "happy meat" position).<ref name="Francione2010"/>{{rp|62–63}}

[[Donald Watson]], the first vegan activist and founder of [[The Vegan Society]], stated in response to a question on why he was an ethical vegan, "If an open-minded, honest person pursues a course long enough, and listens to all the criticisms, and in one's own mind can satisfactorily meet all the criticisms against that idea, sooner or later one's resistance against what one sees as evil tradition has to be discarded."<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vegansociety.com/sites/default/files/DW_Interview_2002_Unabridged_Transcript.pdf|title=Donald Watson 2002 Unabridged Interview|last=George|first=Roger|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027031624/https://www.vegansociety.com/sites/default/files/DW_Interview_2002_Unabridged_Transcript.pdf|archive-date=27 October 2019}}</ref> On [[Blood sport|bloodsports]], he has said that "to kill creatures for fun must be the very dregs," and that [[vivisection]] and [[Animal testing|animal experimentation]] "is probably the cruelest of all Man's attack on the rest of Creation." He has also stated that "[[vegetarianism]], whilst being a necessary stepping-stone, between meat eating and veganism, is only a stepping stone."<ref name=":3" />

[[Alex Hershaft]], co-founder of the [[Farm Animal Rights Movement]] and [[Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]], states he "was always bothered by the idea of hitting a beautiful, living, innocent animal over the head, cutting him up into pieces, then shoving the pieces into [his] mouth," and that his experiences in the Nazi Holocaust allowed him "to empathize with the conditions of animals in factory farms, auction yards, and slaughterhouses" because he "knows firsthand what it's like to be treated like a worthless object."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIgAi6k69IQC&pg=PA145|title=People Promoting and People Opposing Animal Rights: In Their Own Words|last=Kistler|first=John M.|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313313226|pages=145–146|language=en}}</ref>

Law professor [[Gary Francione]], an abolitionist, argues that all sentient beings should have the right not to be treated as property, and that adopting veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non-humans have intrinsic moral value.{{efn|[[Gary Francione]] (2009): "We all believe it's wrong to inflict unnecessary suffering and death on animals.&nbsp;... So now the next question becomes 'what do we mean by necessity?' Well, whatever it means, whatever abstract meaning it has, if it has any meaning whatsoever, its minimal meaning has to be that it's wrong to inflict suffering and death on animals for reasons of pleasure, amusement or convenience&nbsp;... Problem is 99.9999999 percent of our animal use can only be justified by reasons of pleasure, amusement or convenience."<ref>Eric Prescott, [http://vimeo.com/23001319 "I'm Vegan: Gary Francione], Vimeo, 2009, from 00:13:53.</ref>}}<ref name="Francione2010" />{{rp|62|quote=[Gary L. Francione:] Ethical veganism must be the unequivocal moral baseline of any social and political movement that recognizes that nonhuman animals have inherent or intrinsic moral value and are not resources for human use.}} Philosopher [[Tom Regan]], also a rights theorist, argues that animals possess value as "subjects-of-a-life", because they have beliefs, desires, memory and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals. The right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden by other moral principles, but Regan argues that pleasure, convenience and the economic interests of farmers are not weighty enough.<ref>[[Tom Regan]], ''The Case for Animal Rights'', University of California Press, 1983, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tWjRmxFE4C&pg=PA243 243], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tWjRmxFE4C&pg=PA333 333–339].</ref> Philosopher [[Peter Singer]], a protectionist and utilitarian, argues that there is no moral or logical justification for failing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making decisions, and that killing animals should be rejected unless necessary for survival.<ref>[[Peter Singer]], ''[[Practical Ethics]]'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lNgnV0eDtM0C&pg=PA50 50]; Singer 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lNgnV0eDtM0C&pg=PA60 60–61].</ref> Despite this, he writes that "ethical thinking can be sensitive to circumstances", and that he is "not too concerned about trivial infractions".<ref>Peter Singer and Jim Mason, ''The Way We Eat'', Rodale, 2006, 281–282.</ref>

An argument proposed by [[Bruce Friedrich]], also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because it focuses on personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can.<ref>[[Bruce Friedrich]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080611232631/http://www.goveg.com/effectiveAdvocacy_personal.asp "Personal Purity vs. Effective Advocacy"], PETA, 2006.</ref> For Francione, this is similar to arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own [[consequentialist]] terms.<ref name="Francione2010"/>{{rp|72–73|quote=[Gary L. Francione:] The PETA/Singer position is problematic on its own consequentialist terms because it assumes that not observing veganism will make it easier to persuade others to go vegan. But it is as likely that the opposite is true. [...] It is just as likely as a matter of consequence alone that such an event may serve as an opportunity for the animal advocate to educate her companions about why she views the moral issue as she does and thereby influence their thinking about the issue.}}

Philosopher [[Val Plumwood]] maintained that ethical veganism is "subtly [[Anthropocentrism|human-centred]]", an example of what she called "human/nature dualism" because it views humanity as separate from the rest of nature. Ethical vegans want to admit non-humans into the category that deserves special protection, rather than recognize the "ecological embeddedness" of all.<ref>[[Val Plumwood]], "Gender, Eco-Feminism and the Environment", in Robert White (ed.), ''Controversies in Environmental Sociology'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, 52–53.</ref> Plumwood wrote that animal food may be an "unnecessary evil" from the perspective of the consumer who "draws on the whole planet for nutritional needs"—and she strongly opposed factory farming—but for anyone relying on a much smaller ecosystem, it is very difficult or impossible to be vegan.<ref>Val Plumwood, [http://epress.anu.edu.au/titles/the-eye-of-the-crocodile ''The Eye of the Crocodile''], edited by Lorraine Shannon, Canberra: Australian National University E Press, 2012, 87.</ref>

[[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]], a [[transhumanist]] philosopher, has argued that humanity has a "hedonistic imperative" to not merely avoid [[cruelty to animals]] or abolish the ownership of non-human animals, but also to redesign the global ecosystem such that [[wild animal suffering]] ceases to exist.<ref>Thweatt-Bates, Jeanine (2016). ''Cyborg Selves: A Theological Anthropology of the Posthuman''. London: Routledge, 100–101 (first published 2012).</ref> In the pursuit of abolishing suffering itself, Pearce promotes [[predation]] elimination among animals and the "cross-species global analogue of the [[welfare state]]".

[[Plasmodium]]-carrying species of the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito keep human populations in check. In each case, a valuable ecological role is achieved at the price of immense suffering and the loss of hundreds of millions of lives. What's in question isn't the value of the parasite or predator's ecological role, but whether intelligent moral agents can perform that role better. On some fairly modest assumptions, fertility regulation via family planning or cross-species [[immunocontraception]] is a more civilised and compassionate policy option than famine, predation and disease. The biggest obstacle to a future of compassionate ecosystems is the ideology of traditional conservation biology—and unreflective [[status quo bias]].}}</ref> The increasing number of vegans and vegetarians in the transhumanism movement has been attributed in part to Pearce's influence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fairlie|first=Simon|title=Meat: A Benign Extravagance|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2010|at=230–231|isbn=978-1603583251}}</ref>

A growing [[political philosophy]] that incorporates veganism as part of its [[Social revolution|revolutionary]] [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] is [[veganarchism]], which seeks "total abolition" or "[[Total liberationism|total liberation]]" for all animals, including humans. Veganarchists identify the [[State (polity)|state]] as unnecessary and harmful to animals, both human and non-human, and advocate for the adoption of a vegan lifestyle within a [[stateless society]]. The term was popularized in 1995 with Brian A. Dominick's pamphlet ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution'', described as "a vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism".<ref name="Brian">Dominick, Brian. ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism'', third edition, Firestarter Press, 1997, pp. 5–6.</ref>

[[Direct action]] is a common practice among veganarchists (and anarchists generally) with groups like the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) and [[Revolutionary Cells – Animal Liberation Brigade]] (RCALB) often engaging in such activities, sometimes criminally, to further their goals. [[Steven Best]], animal rights activist and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]], is an advocate of this approach, and has been critical of vegan activists like Francione for supporting animal liberation, but not total liberation, which would include not only opposition to "the property status of animals", but also "a serious critique of capitalism, the state, property relations, and commodification dynamics in general." In particular, he criticizes the focus on the simplistic and apolitical "Go Vegan" message directed mainly at wealthy Western audiences, while ignoring people of color, the working class and the poor, especially in the developing world, noting that "for every person who becomes vegan, a thousand flesh eaters arise in China, India and Indonesia." The "faith in the singular efficacy of conjectural education and moral persuasion," Best writes, is no substitute for "direct action, mass confrontation, civil disobedience, alliance politics, and struggle for radical change."<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1057/9781137440723_2 |chapter=The New Abolitionism: Capitalism, Slavery, and Animal Liberation |title=The Politics of Total Liberation |year=2014 |last1=Best |first1=Steven |pages=21–49 |isbn=978-1-349-50086-4 }}</ref> [[Donald Watson]] has stated that he "respects the people enormously who do it, believing that it's the most direct and quick way to achieve their ends."<ref name=":3" />

Some vegans also embrace the philosophy of [[anti-natalism]], as they see the two as complementary in terms of "harm reduction" to animals and the environment.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a14751412/antinatalism/|title=This Extreme Sect of Vegans Thinks Your Baby Will Destroy the Planet|last=Pelley |first=Virginia |date=29 January 2018 |magazine= [[Marie Claire]]|access-date=30 July 2018 }}</ref>

Environmental vegans focus on [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing, hunting, trapping and farming, particularly [[factory farming]], are environmentally unsustainable. In 2010, [[Paul Watson]] of the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] called pigs and chicken "major aquatic predators", because livestock eat 40 percent of the fish that are caught.<ref name=environmental/> {{As of|2002|since=y}}, all Sea Shepherd ships have been vegan for environmental reasons.

The answer is because vegetarianism and especially veganism are powerful alternatives to eight billion human beings and their domestic animals eating the oceans alive. The diversity in our ocean is being diminished more and more every day and when diversity collapses, interdependence between species collapses and the result is a dead ocean. And a dead ocean means death to all creatures big and small because if the ocean dies, we all die. [...] Sea Shepherd's position is that all commercial fisheries must be shut down so fish can have a chance to recover. The only relatively 'sustainable' fisheries are artisanal fishing by fishermen working from very small boats out of tiny ports in India, Africa, etc. We need to remove the corporations, the big trawlers, [[seiner]]s, and long-liners, the heavy gear, the big nets, the long lines and the factory ships if our oceans are going to be saved.}}</ref>

===Feminist veganism===
{{See also|Vegetarian ecofeminism}}

====Pioneers====
One of the leading activists and scholars of feminist animal rights is [[Carol J. Adams]]. Her premier work, ''The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory'' (1990), sparked what was to become a movement in animal rights as she noted the relationship between feminism and meat consumption. Since the release of ''The Sexual Politics of Meat'', Adams has published several other works including essays, books, and keynote addresses. In one of her speeches, "Why feminist-vegan now?"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=C. J.|title=Why feminist-vegan now?|journal=Feminism & Psychology|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=302–317|doi=10.1177/0959353510368038|year=2010|s2cid=146751008|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e0b9a07cd93c8046f8ecb220a51202570470ad15}}</ref>—adapted from her original address at the "Minding Animals" conference in Newcastle, Australia (2009)—Adams states that "the idea that there was a connection between feminism and vegetarianism came to [her] in October 1974", illustrating that the concept of feminist veganism has been around for nearly half a century. Other authors have also paralleled Adams' ideas while expanding on them. Angella Duvnjak states in "Joining the Dots: Some Reflections on Feminist-Vegan Political Practice and Choice" that she was met with opposition to the connection of feminist and veganism ideals, although the connection seemed more than obvious to her and other scholars (2011).<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Duvnjak|first=Angella|date=6 September 2011|title=Joining the Dots: Some Reflections on Feminist-Vegan Political Practice and Choice|url=https://www.outskirts.arts.uwa.edu.au/volumes/volume-24/duvnjak|access-date=7 March 2018|journal=Outskirts|publication-date=May 2011|volume=24|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180308035756/https://www.outskirts.arts.uwa.edu.au/volumes/volume-24/duvnjak|archive-date=8 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other scholars elaborate on the connections between feminism, such as Carrie Hamilton who makes the connection to sex workers and animal reproductive rights.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Carrie|title=sex, work, meat: the feminist politics of veganism|journal=Feminist Review|language=en|volume=114|issue=1|pages=112–129|doi=10.1057/s41305-016-0011-1|year=2017|s2cid=152213281}}</ref> Many other scholars of feminist vegan philosophy continue to add to the arguments that Adams, Duvnjak, and Hamilton have brought forth.

====Animal and human abuse parallels====
Some of the main concepts of feminist veganism is that is the connection between the violence and oppression of animals. For example, Marjorie Spiegal compares the consumption or servitude of animals for human gain to slavery.<ref name=":1"/> Animals are purchased from a breeder, used for personal gain—either for further breeding or manual labor—and then discarded, most frequently as food. This capitalist use of animals for personal gain has held strong, despite the work of animal rights activists and ecofriendly feminists.

Similar notions that suggest animals—like fish, for example—feel less pain are brought forth today as a justification for animal cruelty.<ref name=":1"/> The feminist side of the argument states that there is no rationalization for treating animal lives with lesser reverence than human lives, even if the theory that animals are less capable of pain is verifiable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Another connection between feminism and veganism is the parallel of violence against women or other minority members and the violence against animals. Animal rights activists closely relate animal cruelty to feminist issues. This connection is even further mirrored as animals that are used for breeding practices are compared to human trafficking victims and migrant sex workers.<ref name=":0"/> Hamilton comments that violent "rapists sometimes exhibit behavior that seems to be patterned on the mutilation of animals" suggesting there is a trend between the violence towards rape victims and animal cruelty previously exhibited by the rapist.<ref name=":0"/>

====Capitalism and feminist veganism====
Another way that feminist veganism relates to feminist thoughts is through the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] means of the production itself. [[Carol J. Adams]] mentions Barbara Noske talking about "meat eating as the ultimate capitalist product, because it takes so much to make the product, it uses up so many resources".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=88416ac1-93ae-431e-89c1-b12379291e33@sessionmgr103&vid=7&hid=104|title=Vegan Feminist: An Interview with Carol J.

Donald Watson argued, "If [[Jesus]] were alive today, he'd be an itinerant vegan propagandist instead of an itinerant preacher of those days, spreading the message of compassion, which, as I see it, is the only useful part of what religion has to offer and, sad as it seems, I doubt if we have to enroll our priest as a member of [[the Vegan Society]]."<ref name=":3" />

These findings are consistent with vegans who feel discriminated by people who eat meat.<ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden"/> There are also meat-eaters who do not transition to a vegan diet because they fear to be stigmatized when becoming a vegan.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Markowski |first1=Kelly L. |last2=Roxburgh |first2=Susan |title='If I became a vegan, my family and friends would hate me:' Anticipating vegan stigma as a barrier to plant-based diets |journal=Appetite |date=April 2019 |volume=135 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2018.12.040 |pmid=30605705 |s2cid=58643649 }}</ref>

These negative prejudices against vegans are sometimes termed ''[[vegaphobia]]''.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-658-22438-7_12 |chapter=Vegaphobie: Ein Hindernis auf dem Weg zur Nachhaltigkeit |title=Chancen und Grenzen der Nachhaltigkeitstransformation |year=2019 |last1=Bendl |first1=Regine |last2=Delmestri |first2=Giuseppe |last3=Kudelka |first3=Petr |pages=201–229 |isbn=978-3-658-22437-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cole |first1=Matthew |last2=Morgan |first2=Karen |title=Vegaphobia: derogatory discourses of veganism and the reproduction of speciesism in UK national newspapers1 |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |date=March 2011 |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=134–153 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01348.x |pmid=21361905 }}</ref><ref name="Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An">{{cite journal |last1=Vandermoere |first1=Frédéric |last2=Geerts |first2=Robbe |last3=De Backer |first3=Charlotte |last4=Erreygers |first4=Sara |last5=Van Doorslaer |first5=Els |title=Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An Exploration of the Characteristics of Meat Eaters, Vegaphobes, and Their Social Environment |journal=Sustainability |date=19 July 2019 |volume=11 |issue=14 |pages=3936 |doi=10.3390/su11143936 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Positive feelings regarding vegans also exist, however: because of their diet, they may be rated as more virtuous.

=== Media ===

In 2011, a media analysis found that veganism and vegans are discredited in British media through ridicule, or as being difficult or impossible to maintain in practice. Vegans were variously stereotyped as ascetics, faddists, sentimentalists, or in some cases, hostile extremists. The study found that of 397 articles, 20% were neutral, approximately 5% were positive and 75% were negative.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cole |first1=Matthew |last2=Morgan |first2=Karen |title=Vegaphobia: derogatory discourses of veganism and the reproduction of speciesism in UK national newspapers |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |date=March 2011 |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=134–153 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01348.x |pmid=21361905 }}</ref> In 2018, a British food editor lost his job because a message from him showed him talking about "killing vegans one by one".<ref>Why do people hate vegans so much?

In social media, some vegans are also attacked for their choice to have only sexual relations to other vegans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Potts |first1=Annie |last2=Parry |first2=Jovian |title=Vegan Sexuality: Challenging Heteronormative Masculinity through Meat-free Sex |journal=Feminism & Psychology |date=15 February 2010 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=53–72 |doi=10.1177/0959353509351181 |s2cid=144430044 }}</ref>

=== Reasons ===

Negative attitudes against vegans are largest in people who share conservative or [[right-wing]] ideologies,<ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden"/><ref name="A dual-process motivational model o">{{cite journal |last1=Judge |first1=Madeline |last2=Wilson |first2=Marc S. |title=A dual-process motivational model of attitudes towards vegetarians and vegans |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |date=February 2019 |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=169–178 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2386 |doi-access=free }}</ref> often being most pronounced in far-right groups.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Weill|first=Kelly|date=2018-08-24|title=Why Right Wingers Are Going Crazy About Meat|language=en|work=The Daily Beast|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-right-wingers-are-going-crazy-about-meat|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> For right-wing adherents, eating meat is not only a delight, but also a part of their attitude towards life. Thus, those who advocate against meat consumption can be perceived a threat to their way of life.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhont |first1=Kristof |last2=Hodson |first2=Gordon |title=Why do right-wing adherents engage in more animal exploitation and meat consumption? |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=July 2014 |volume=64 |pages=12–17 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2014.02.002 |url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5030419 }}</ref> A survey of about 1,000 participants showed that vegans are perceived as a threat mainly by older and lower-educated people and convinced meat eaters.<ref name="Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An"/> A 2019 study found a positive correlation between worldviews rooted in [[Power (social and political)|social dominance]] and a negative perception of vegans.<ref name="A dual-process motivational model o"/>

Explanations are founded on what is sometimes called the [[meat paradox]]: many people who eat meat like to eat meat but do not like to harm animals. Vegans can contribute to those who eat meat being aware of this [[cognitive dissonance]], which in turn will lead to discomfort in meat eaters and eventually interactions between vegans and meat eaters can become strained.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rothgerber |first1=Hank |title=Efforts to overcome vegetarian-induced dissonance among meat eaters |journal=Appetite |date=August 2014 |volume=79 |pages=32–41 |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2014.04.003 |pmid=24727102 |s2cid=12089867 }}</ref><ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden"/>
Therefore, one way to resolve this inner conflict and reduce dissonance is to maintain prejudice against vegans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bastian |first1=Brock |last2=Loughnan |first2=Steve |title=Resolving the Meat-Paradox: A Motivational Account of Morally Troublesome Behavior and Its Maintenance |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |date=19 May 2016 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=278–299 |doi=10.1177/1088868316647562 |pmid=27207840 |s2cid=13360236 |url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/25381242/Bastian_Loughnan_2016_PSPR_meat_paradox.pdf }}</ref>

Another proposed reason for negative attitudes against vegans is that meat eaters may feel judged by vegans for eating meat. Discrediting ethical vegans as [[do-gooder]]s is then a way to invalidate the judgement of oneself. These negative attitudes against vegans are higher when vegans are thought to think of themselves as morally superior.<ref name="Do-Gooder Derogation">{{cite journal |last1=Minson |first1=Julia A. |last2=Monin |first2=Benoît |title=Do-Gooder Derogation |journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science |date=18 July 2011 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=200–207 |doi=10.1177/1948550611415695 |s2cid=13891898 }}</ref>

While there may be an inner conflict in meat eaters when it comes to the killing and eating of animals, this theory may not hold up to environmental reasons for not eating meat. Environmentalists may not see a conflict in eating meat because they see their individual environmental impact of meat consumption as low.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Evon |last2=Kallis |first2=Giorgos |last3=Zografos |first3=Christos |last4=Olsson |first4=I Anna S |title=Why environmentalists eat meat |journal=PLOS ONE |date=11 July 2019 |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=e0219607 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0219607 |pmid=31295301 |pmc=6622546 |bibcode=2019PLoSO..1419607S }}</ref>

Also, vegans are not always discredited for ideological reasons. Sometimes the reason may be that the person cannot share their food with them.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bresnahan |first1=Mary |last2=Zhuang |first2=Jie |last3=Zhu |first3=Xun |title=Why is the vegan line in the dining hall always the shortest?

== Vegan rights ==
In some countries, vegans have some rights to meals and legal protections against [[discrimination]].

* In [[Portugal]], starting in 2017, public administration canteens and cafeterias such as schools, prisons and social services must offer at least one vegan option at every meal.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017|title=Lei n.º 11/2017 (Law No. 11/2017)|url=https://dre.pt/pesquisa/-/search/106886578/details/maximized|website=[[Diário da República]]|at=Note that the law means vegan, not what is commonly understood as vegetarian: Art. 3-2 specifies that "Para efeitos do número anterior, entende-se por «opção vegetariana» a que assenta em refeições que não contenham quaisquer produtos de origem animal." ("For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, «vegetarian option» is understood to be based on meals that do not contain any products of animal origin.")|language=pt}}</ref>
* In the [[United Kingdom]] , a 2020 judicial ruling stated that "ethical veganism" is a protected characteristic under the [[Equality Act 2010]] (like gender, ethnicity and religion).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mr J Casamitjana Costa v The League Against Cruel Sports: 3331129/2018|url=https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunal-decisions/mr-j-casamitjana-costa-v-the-league-against-cruel-sports-3331129-2018|access-date=2020-11-14|website=GOV.UK|language=en|quote=Ethical veganism is a philosophical belief which qualifies as a protected belief within the meaning of Section 10 of the Equal Act 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/01/03/ethical-veganism-is-a-protected-class-akin-to-religion-in-the-u-k-after-a-landmark-ruling/|title='Ethical veganism' is a protected class akin to religion in the U.K. after a landmark ruling|first=Emily|last=Heil|date=January 3, 2020|website=[[The Washington Post]]|url-access=registration}}</ref>
* The [[Federal Police (Germany)|German police]] sometimes provides on-duty staff with food. After not being provided a vegan option in this context, a vegan employee has been granted an additional food allowance.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-01-10|title=Vegan bei der Polizei|url=https://veganes-recht.de/vegan-bei-der-polizei|access-date=2020-10-15|website=Veganes Recht|language=de-DE}}</ref> 
* In [[Ontario]], a province of [[Canada]], there were reports<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ethical Veganism Now Legally Recognized in Ontario, Canada|url=https://vegnews.com/2016/1/ethical-veganism-now-legally-recognized-in-ontario-canada|access-date=2020-09-15|website=VegNews.com|language=en-US}}</ref> that ethical veganism became protected under the [[Human Rights Code (Ontario)|Ontario Human Rights Code]], following a 2015 update to legal guidance by the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]]. However, said body later issued a statement that this question is for a judge or tribunal to decide on a case-by-case basis.<ref>{{Cite web|date=February 25, 2016|title=In response to claims that ethical veganism is now a creed|url=http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/news_centre/response-claims-ethical-veganism-now-creed|website=OHRC}}</ref>

==Economics of veganism==
{{See also|Economic vegetarianism|Food vs. feed}}
The documentary film ''[[Cowspiracy]]'' estimates that a vegan, over the course of one year, will save 1.5 million litres of water, 6,607&nbsp;kg of grain, 1,022 square metres of forest cover, 3,322&nbsp;kg of {{CO2}}, and 365 animal lives compared to the average U.S. diet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thevegancalculator.com/#calculator |access-date=27 May 2019|title=Vegan Calculator - the Vegan Web Designer}}</ref>{{fix|link=WP:RS|text=scholarly source needed}} According to a 2016 study, if everyone in the U.S. switched to a vegan diet, the country would save $208.2 billion in direct health-care savings, $40.5 billion in indirect health-care savings, $40.5 billion in environmental savings, and $289.1 billion in total savings by 2050. The study also found that if everybody in the world switched to a vegan diet, the global economy would save $684.4 billion in direct health-care savings, $382.6 billion in indirect health-care savings, $569.5 billion in environmental savings, and $1.63 trillion in total savings by 2050.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Springmann |first1=Marco |last2=Godfray |first2=H.

In his 2015 book ''[[Doing Good Better]]'', [[William MacAskill]] stated:

{{cquote|Economists have worked out how, on average, a consumer affects the number of animal products supplied by declining to buy that product. They estimate that, on average, if you give up one egg, total production ultimately falls by 0.91 eggs; if you give up one gallon of milk, total production falls by 0.56 gallons. Other products are somewhere in between: economists estimate that if you give up one pound of beef, beef production falls by 0.68 pounds; if you give up one pound of pork, production ultimately falls by 0.74 pounds; if you give up one pound of chicken, production ultimately falls by 0.76 pounds.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacAskill |first=William |title= Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Help Others, Do Work that Matters, and Make Smarter Choices about Giving Back |publisher=Random House |date=28 July 2015}}{{page needed|date=March 2020}}</ref>}}
