===Shooting of student at law school===
Duterte stated at a rally in April 2016 that he shot a fellow student who had bullied him about his Visayan origin as well as other students of the same ethnicity, while at San Beda law college. He said "But the truth is, I'm used to shooting people. When we were about to graduate from San Beda, I shot a person." Duterte said that he shot the student in a corridor at the college when the said student called him names again. He later told a reporter that the student survived, but refused to answer any further questions about the incident.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/780836/law-student-duterte-shot-frat-brod-on-campus-in-72 |title=Law student Duterte shot frat brod on campus in '72 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=May 22, 2016 |access-date=September 24, 2016 }}</ref>

However, in an interview aired at 24 Oras and published on the official GMA News Online website on April 22, 2016, retired labor arbiter Arthur Amansec said Duterte and Octavio Goco at that time were both playing with a gun as it was normal for students to bring guns to school in the seventies. Amansec&nbsp;is Duterte's former classmate in San Beda College who witnessed the incident. He added that "the bullet hit the school's wooden floor and was embedded there."

As early as the first quarter of 2015, Duterte made hints to the media of his intention to run for president in the 2016 elections. However, he denied these plans numerous times amidst clamor from his supporters for him to run.

In January, Duterte said he would abolish Congress if he chose to run for president and was elected.<ref>{{cite news|title=Duterte eyes abolition of Congress if elected president in 2016|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/2015/01/26/1416721/duterte-eyes-abolition-congress-if-elected-president-2016|access-date=November 6, 2016|work=The Philippine Star}}</ref> On November 21, in a private gathering with fraternity brothers from [[San Beda College of Law]], Duterte formally announced his presidential bid and also finally accepted [[Alan Peter Cayetano]]'s offer to be his running mate, and named his daughter, Sara Duterte, as his substitute for Mayor.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dioquino |first=Rose-An Jessica |date=November 27, 2015 |title=Duterte files COC for president |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/545982/news/nation/duterte-files-coc-for-president |work=GMA News |access-date=July 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Duterte makes a stand |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/duterte-makes-a-stand/#LubMmVQSGTGM834v.99 |work=Manila Bulletin |access-date=November 22, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123202534/http://www.mb.com.ph/duterte-makes-a-stand/ |archive-date=November 23, 2015 }}</ref>

In his campaign, he said he would introduce a federal parliamentary form of government. He also promised to kill tens of thousands of criminals and eradicate crime in six months.<ref>{{cite news|title=Philippines election: Duterte declares victory and promises change|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/rodrigo-duterte-declares-victory-in-philippines-election-vows-to-rewrite-constitution|access-date=November 6, 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name="ABC6"/>

===Constitutional reform===
Rodrigo Duterte campaigned for [[decentralization]] and a shift to federal government during the 2016 presidential election. In an October 2014 forum organized by ''Federal Movement for a Better Philippines'' in [[Cebu City]] prior to joining the presidential race, the then-mayor of Davao City called for the creation of two federal states for [[Moro people]] as a solution to the problems besetting [[Mindanao]].<ref name="inq">{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/643859/argument-for-federalism-manila-steals-funds |title=Argument for federalism: Manila steals funds |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |author=Lacorte, G. |date=October 10, 2014 |access-date=May 17, 2017}}</ref> Mayor Duterte said that [[Nur Misuari]] and his [[Moro National Liberation Front]] don't see eye-to-eye with the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] which the administration of President [[Benigno Aquino III]] had inked a peace deal with.

===Rape comments===
{{further|Rodrigo Duterte 2016 presidential campaign#Rape of an Australian missionary}}
At a campaign rally on April 12, 2016, Duterte told supporters that, as mayor, he thought he "should have been first" to rape Jacqueline Hamill, an Australian missionary who was [[gang-rape]]d and killed during the [[1989 Davao hostage crisis]]. He recalled examining her corpse and saying that he "should have gone first".<ref>{{cite news|title=The dark, cruel joke about rape that derailed a presidential campaign|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/philippine-presidential-candidate-rodrigo-duterte-gang-rape-comments-a6990911.html|access-date=November 5, 2016|work=The Independent|date=April 19, 2016}}</ref>

After being condemned for his comments, Duterte apologized for the incident and claimed the comment was a "bad remark" and that he regretted his "gutter language," but "would not apologize for being misinterpreted." He said that the comment was not a "joke," as was reported by some media outlets, and that he made it out of "utter anger" when recalling the events.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-18/rodrigo-duterte-hits-back-back-as-rape-remark-sparks-fury/7333532|title=Rodrigo Duterte: Philippines presidential candidate hits back as rape remark sparks fury|work=ABC News}}</ref><!-- There was an earlier supplementary citation of a Rappler.com source, but per an RSN post, that appears to be a social media site or a venue for self-publishing, whose use here violated WP:BLPSPS.

===Human rights===
In a campaign speech on April 27 to business leaders, he said his presidency would be "a bloody one", but that he would issue "a thousand pardons a day" to police and soldiers accused of human rights abuses, and would also issue a presidential pardon to himself for mass murder at the end of his six-year term.<ref name="ABC6">{{cite news|title=Philippine presidential frontrunner Rodrigo Duterte vows to pardon himself for murder|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-28/philippine-candidate-rodrigo-duterte-vows-murder-pardon/7365436|access-date=November 6, 2016|work=Australian Broadcasting Company}}</ref>

The Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte began at noon on June 30, 2016, when he became the [[List of Philippine Presidents#List of Presidents|16th]] [[President of the Philippines]], succeeding [[Benigno Aquino III]].

He described how the corpses were dumped at the roadside ("salvage" victims), or had their heads wrapped in masking tape with a cardboard placard labelling them as a drug offender, so that the killing would not be investigated. The chairman of the [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]], [[Chito Gascon]], was quoted in the report: "I am not surprised, I have heard of this." The [[Philippine National Police]] declined to comment. The report stated: "although ''The Guardian'' can verify the policeman's rank and his service history, there is no independent, official confirmation for the allegations of state complicity and police coordination in mass murder."<ref>{{cite news|title=Philippines secret death squads: officer claims police teams behind wave of killings|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/philippines-secret-death-squads-police-officer-teams-behind-killings|access-date=October 6, 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

In February 2018, the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' published aerial surveillance photos of Chinese military fortifications in the South China Sea which showed runways, hangars, control towers, helipads, radomes and multi-storey buildings on reefs across the region, described by the newspaper as "island fortresses". The photos, which were mostly taken in late 2017, were authenticated by the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], which described them as "the most complete, detailed batch of aerial pics available", and stated that the "photos show China is nearly done with its militarization of South China Sea". Duterte's spokesman told reporters: "[The region has] long been militarized. And the question is, what can we do?" – which led to accusations of dereliction of his "sacred core duty" of defending Philippine territory.<ref>{{cite news|title=Photos show Beijing's militarisation of South China Sea in new detail|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/06/photos-beijings-militarisation-south-china-sea-philippines|access-date=February 19, 2018|work=The Guardian|date=February 6, 2018}}</ref>

Early in his term, Duterte's expletive-laden outbursts triggered the biggest exodus from stocks in a year and made the peso Asia's worst performer in September 2016. The Philippine currency was at a seven-year low and rounding out its worst month since May 2010. In the same month, the Philippine peso completed its biggest monthly decline since October 2000 amid the biggest outflow from the nation's stocks in a year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-30/philippine-peso-completes-worst-month-in-16-years-amid-outflows |title=Philippine Peso Completes Worst Month in 16 Years Amid Outflows |author=Lopez, Ditas B. |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=September 30, 2016 |access-date=October 7, 2016}}</ref> According to the Philippines' Finance Secretary [[Carlos Dominguez III|Carlos Dominguez]], the peso's slump this year is "mainly due to a deteriorating trade outlook because of rising imports of capital goods, which is normal for a country that is growing very fast".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/philippines-in-a-sweet-spot-despite-peso-slump-dominguez-says | title=RP in sweet spot despite peso slump |date=August 17, 2017|work=Bloomberg}}</ref> Currency strategists have, however, "predicted a rebound once investors see beyond Duterte's words".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/duterte-s-noisy-peso-rout-out-of-harmony-with-philippine-economy |title=Duterte's Peso Rout Runs Counter to the Booming Philippine Economy |last1=Liau |first1=Y-Sing |last2=Lopez |first2=Ditas B |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=September 29, 2016 |access-date=October 7, 2016}}</ref>

In October 2016, the French newspaper ''[[Libération]]'' depicted Duterte as a "serial killer president", pertaining to the spate of drug-related killings in the Philippines. The newspaper report drew condemnation from the Filipino community in France. Presidential Spokesperson [[Ernesto Abella]] said in a radio interview that the newspaper's presentation of Duterte as a serial killer was "very unfair" and "irresponsible" while DILG Secretary [[Ismael Sueno]] stated that the description was "too much" and noted the lack of understanding over the administration's war on drugs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/146418/french-paper-banners-duterte-as-serial-killer-president |title=French paper banners Duterte as 'serial killer president' |author=Gonzales, Yuji Vincent |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 9, 2016 |access-date=October 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/palace-hits-french-dailys-serial-killer-tag-on-duterte/ |title=Palace hits French daily's "serial killer" tag on Duterte |author=Kabiling, Genalyn |work=Manila Bulletin |date=October 9, 2016 |access-date=October 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/10/10/1632125/french-newspaper-calls-duterte-serial-killer |title=French newspaper calls Duterte 'serial killer'  |work=The Philippine Star |date=October 10, 2016 |access-date=October 22, 2016}}</ref>

Then Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque cited a Social Weather Stations survey showing a "record-low" of 6.1 percent of Filipinos who said they had fallen victim to common crimes. "We reiterate that the administration's campaign against illegal drugs is conducted through legitimate police enforcement operations, and deaths arising from these are due to the drug personalities’ violent resistance to lawful apprehensions," he said.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/07/20/18/palace-to-rights-group-duterte-did-not-make-ph-a-more-dangerous-place|title=Palace to rights group: Duterte did not make PH a 'more dangerous place'|last=Placido|first=Dharel |work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=November 21, 2019}}</ref>

Duterte has repeatedly admitted to killing three people while he was the Mayor of Davao. In December 2015, Duterte recounted shooting three gunmen dead only months into his first mayoral term in 1988 after they had kidnapped and raped a Chinese girl.

Duterte was once married to [[Elizabeth Zimmerman|Elizabeth Abellana Zimmerman]], a flight attendant of [[Jewish]] and [[German American]] descent from Davao City. She traces her roots in [[Tuburan, Cebu]]. They together have three children (from eldest to youngest): [[Paolo Duterte|Paolo]] ("Pulong"), [[Sara Duterte|Sara]] ("Inday Sara") and Sebastian ("Baste"). Paolo and Sara entered politics while Baste, with no interest in politics, concentrated on business and surfing but eventually ran and won as Davao City Vice Mayor in 2019.<ref name="DBD">{{cite web|url=https://durianburgdavao.wordpress.com/2015/05/16/the-dutertes-in-davao-city-politics/|title=The Dutertes in Davao City Politics|work=Durian Post by DurianburgDavao}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|sure=y|date=June 2020}} In 2012, Duterte made a notorious remark in a media interview regarding an incident where Paolo's name was allegedly linked to a carnapping ([[portmanteau]] of car and [[kidnapping]]) syndicate led by Ryan Yu.

Duterte has been publicly very open about his infidelity and philandering while married to Zimmerman and cited it as the reason for his failed first marriage when asked in interviews. In 1998, Zimmerman filed a petition in the [[Regional Trial Court]] in [[Pasig]] to nullify her marriage. Duterte never appeared in court and did not contest Zimmerman's petition. Two years later, the court decided in her favor, ending the 27-year marriage of Duterte and Zimmerman. Duterte and Zimmerman have been on good terms in recent years with Zimmerman stating, "Yes, [Rodrigo] is really a very good leader. That is all he is. But when it comes to family, he is not capable of taking care of it." In 2001, Zimmerman eventually ran for a seat on the city council but lost. Duterte and Zimmerman are said to have patched things up and appear to be civil to each other, 15 years after their marriage was declared null and void. Zimmerman eventually joined the campaign trail for Duterte's presidential candidacy in early 2016 called ''Byaheng Du30'' in which she would travel by bus to major cities together with her daughter Sara and a number of delegates.<ref name="Zimmerman" />

Despite being raised as a communicant of the [[Catholic Church]], on January 19, 2016, while meeting with businessmen in [[Binondo]], Manila, Duterte clarified that he has not attended [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] for quite some time already since he deemed it incompatible with his mayoral responsibilities: "If I listened to the [[Ten Commandments]] or to the priests," said Duterte, "I would not be able to do anything as a mayor." He then clarified that he still believed in God, but not in religion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/05/20/1585212/duterte-says-he-believes-god-not-religion |last=Romero |first=Alexis |title=Duterte says he believes in God but not in religion |work=The Philippine Star |date=May 20, 2016 |access-date=September 2, 2016}}</ref> On June 26, 2016, Duterte said he's [[Christianity|Christian]], but also said that he believes "in one God [[Allah]]".<ref name="Christian"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/duterte.vows.to.promote.birth.control.in.the.philippines.says.hes.a.christian.but.believes.in.one.god.allah/89535.htm |title=Duterte vows to promote birth control in the Philippines, says he's a Christian but believes 'in one god Allah' |author=Torres, Hazel |work=[[Christian Today]] |date=June 29, 2016 |access-date=November 6, 2016}}</ref> Later, he challenged the Catholic Church to show evidence of the existence of God, while paradoxically claiming he is neither an [[Atheism|atheist]] nor an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] but happens "to be a human being believing in that there's a universal mind somewhere which controls the universe".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1040733|title=Duterte: I'm not agnostic, not atheist|work=Philippine News Agency|date=July 7, 2018}}</ref> He has also called God "stupid".<ref name="AlJazeera-GodRemark">{{cite news |last1=Regencia |first1=Ted |title=Duterte's 'stupid God' quip is his 'personal opinion' - spokesman |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/duterte-stupid-god-quip-personal-opinion-spokesman-180625082730103.html |access-date=June 5, 2020 |work=Al Jazeera |date=June 25, 2018}}</ref>

A psychological assessment of Duterte was commissioned by Dr. Natividad Dayan during Duterte's marriage annulment to Elizabeth Zimmerman in July 1998. The result was that Duterte (then Davao City mayor) was found to have "[[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] personality disorder", exemplified by "gross indifference, insensitivity and self-centeredness", and a "grandiose sense of self-entitlement and manipulative behaviours". According to the assessment, he had a "pervasive tendency to demean, humiliate others and violate their rights and feelings", and was "unable to reflect on the consequences of his actions."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Samuels |first1=Gabriel |title=Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte mental health assessment reveals tendency to 'violate rights and feelings'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-mental-health-psychological-condition-a7355891.html |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=June 1, 2019}}</ref>
