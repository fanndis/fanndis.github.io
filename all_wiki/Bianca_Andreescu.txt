'''Bianca Vanessa Andreescu''' ({{IPA-ro|andreˈesku}}; born June 16, 2000) is a Canadian professional [[tennis]] player. She has a career-high ranking of No. 4 in the world, and is the highest-ranked Canadian in the history of the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA). Andreescu was the champion at the [[2019 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]] and the [[2019 Rogers Cup|Canadian Open]] in 2019, having defeated [[Serena Williams]] to win both titles. She is the first Canadian tennis player to win a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles title,{{efn|Canadian-born [[Mary Pierce]] won two Grand Slam singles titles while representing France.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mary Pierce |url=https://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/mary-pierce |website=International Tennis Hall of Fame |accessdate=April 1, 2020}}</ref>}} and the first to win the Canadian Open in 50 years. She is also the first player to win a Grand Slam singles title as a teenager since [[Maria Sharapova]] in 2006.

Andreescu began playing tennis in her parents' home country of Romania before returning to Canada, the country of her birth. She had success as a junior, winning the [[Orange Bowl (tennis)|Orange Bowl]] and two Grand Slam doubles titles with compatriot [[Carson Branstine]] en route to reaching a career-best junior ranking of No. 3 in the world. After not playing any matches at the WTA Tour level in 2018, Andreescu had a breakout year in 2019, beginning with a runner-up in her first event of the season, the [[2019 ASB Classic|Auckland Open]]. She then rose to prominence by winning the [[2019 Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells Open]], a Premier Mandatory tournament. Although she missed several months due to injury, Andreescu qualified for the WTA Finals at the end of the season and finished the year ranked No. 5.

Andreescu's style of play that combines power with variety has been widely regarded as "fun to watch" by tennis commentators and journalists. She has strong support from both Canadian and Romanian fanbases.

==Early life and background==
Bianca Andreescu was born on June 16, 2000 in [[Mississauga]], Ontario to Nicu and Maria Andreescu.<ref name=wta-bio/> Her parents emigrated from [[Romania]] to Canada in 1994 when her father accepted a job in the country. Andreescu's father works as a mechanical engineer at an automotive company, while her mother had worked at a bank in Romania. Her family moved back to Romania when Bianca was six years old so that her mother could start a business in their home country. After two and a half years, they closed the business and returned to Canada. Her mother has since worked as the chief compliance officer at a financial services company.<ref name=parents>{{cite web |last1=Freeze |first1=Colin |title=Bianca Andreescu’s cool, hard-working demeanour comes from the example set by her Romanian parents |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/article-from-romania-to-ontario-ambition-has-always-driven-the-andreescu/ |website=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=28 November 2019 | date = September 8, 2019}}</ref> Andreescu began playing tennis in [[Pitești]] at the age of seven.

She finished runner-up to compatriot [[Charlotte Robillard-Millette]] at the Open International Junior de Beaulieu-sur-Mer, her first Grade 1 tournament.

==Playing style==

Andreescu employs a wide variety of shots into her style of play that is set apart by the level of power she incorporates into her game. [[Martina Navratilova]] in particular has noted, "Everyone knows how to bang the ball; it's when you bring something extra to the table that it makes all the difference, and Andreescu brings a lot of extra to the table.

She has been regularly practicing a form of meditation called creative visualization since she was 12 years old. She also practices yoga. She has said, "I don't only work on my physical aspect. I also work on the mental, because that's also very, very important. It's definitely showing through my matches where I'm staying in the present moment a lot of the time. I don't like to focus on what just happened or in the future." While she used to practice creative visualization for a few hours a day, she has since limited this type of meditation to 15 minutes per day due to her busy schedule.<ref name=new-yorker/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/%E2%80%98-first-thing-i-do-meditate%E2%80%99-bianca-andreescu-visualizes-indian-wells-success|title=‘The first thing I do is meditate’: Bianca Andreescu visualizes Indian Wells success|last=Livaudais|first=Stephanie|date=March 14, 2019|website=WTA Tennis|language=en|access-date=September 6, 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190401012853/https://www.wtatennis.com/news/%E2%80%98-first-thing-i-do-meditate%E2%80%99-bianca-andreescu-visualizes-indian-wells-success | archive-date= April 1, 2019 | url-status=dead}}</ref> Andreescu's former coach Aref Jallali credited her mental fortitude to her mother, while another of her former coaches attributed her ability to manage stress to her father.<ref name=parents/>
