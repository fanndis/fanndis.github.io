==History==
Bloomberg News was founded by [[Michael Bloomberg]] and [[Matthew Winkler (journalist)|Matthew Winkler]] in 1990 to deliver financial news reporting to Bloomberg Terminal subscribers.<ref name="Bodine">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9G-FWJIAOSEC|title=Make It New: Essays in the History of American Business|publisher=[[iUniverse]]|year=2004|author=Paul Bodine|pages=180–190|location=[[Lincoln, Nebraska]]|isbn=9780595309214|accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref>

The agency was established in 1990 with a team of six people.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/solutions/bloomberg_news/|title=Bloomberg Solutions|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=2013-05-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624034259/http://www.bloomberg.com/solutions/bloomberg_news/|archivedate=2010-06-24}}</ref> Winkler was first editor-in-chief.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/cult-of-bloomberg-way-underpinned-by-accuracy/story-e6frg996-1226140375103|title=Cult of Bloomberg way underpinned by accuracy|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref> In 2010, Bloomberg News included more than 2,300 [[editor]]s and [[reporter]]s in 72 countries and 146 news bureaus worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/pressroom/facts/|title=At A Glance|publisher=Bloomberg Press Room|accessdate=2013-03-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707114539/http://www.bloomberg.com/pressroom/facts/|archivedate=2012-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jomc.unc.edu/video/bloomberg-news-editor-in-chief-to-speak-oct-16-about-the-economy-and-the-presidential-election|title=Bloomberg News editor-in-chief speaks about the economy and the presidential election|publisher=UNC School of Journalism and Mass Communication|accessdate=2013-03-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224135451/http://www.jomc.unc.edu/video/bloomberg-news-editor-in-chief-to-speak-oct-16-about-the-economy-and-the-presidential-election|archivedate=2013-02-24}}</ref>

===Beginnings (1990–1995)===
Bloomberg Business News was created to expand the services offered through the terminals. According to Matthew Winkler, then a writer for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [[Michael Bloomberg]] telephoned him in November 1989 and asked, "What would it take to get into the news business?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/damian-radcliffe/in-conversation-with-matthew-winkler-editor-in-chief-emeritus-and-co-founder-of-bloomberg-news-61e26e14d904|title=In conversation with Matthew Winkler, Editor-in-Chief Emeritus and co-founder of Bloomberg News|last=Radcliffe|first=Damian|date=2020-01-08|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>

In his book, ''The Bloomberg Way'', Winkler recalls a conversation with Bloomberg about a hypothetical ethical dilemma which could have arisen from Bloomberg's interest in creating a newspaper:

<blockquote>"You have just published a story that says the chairman—and I mean chairman—of your biggest customer has taken $5 million from the corporate till. He is with his secretary at a Rio de Janeiro resort, and the secretary's spurned boyfriend calls to tip you off. You get an independent verification that the story is true. Then the phone rings. The customer's public-relations person says, 'Kill the story or we will return all the terminals we currently rent from you.{{'"}}

"What would you do?" Winkler asked.

"Go with the story," Bloomberg replied. "Our lawyers will love the fees you generate."<ref name="winklerandsondag">{{cite book|author1=Matthew Winkler|author2=Jennifer Sondag|title=The Bloomberg Way|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2014|pages=xi–xii|isbn=978-1-118-84226-3}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Matthew|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNbnAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT8|title=The Bloomberg Way: A Guide for Reporters and Editors|last2=Sondag|first2=Jennifer|date=2014-02-20|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-84233-1|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>

Winkler recalls this as his "deciding moment", the time at which he became willing to help Bloomberg build his news organization.<ref name="winklerandsondag"/><ref name=":0" />

The publication was created to provide concise, timely financial news.<ref name=Bloomberg>{{cite book|author=Michael Bloomberg|title=Bloomberg by Bloomberg|year=1997|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-15545-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bloombergbybloom00bloo/page/79 79–100]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bloombergbybloom00bloo/page/79}}</ref> As a new company in 1990, Bloomberg hoped that the news service would spread the company name, sell more Bloomberg Terminals and end Bloomberg's reliance on the [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones News Services]].<ref name="Bodine"/>

The creation of Bloomberg Business News required Winkler to open a Bloomberg office in [[Washington, D.C.]] to report about political effects on the business world. However, the Standing Committee of Correspondents (SCC) in Washington required Bloomberg News be formally accredited to act as a legitimate news source, a title that Bloomberg Business News only accomplished after agreeing to provide free terminals to major newspapers in exchange for news space in the publications.<ref name="Bodine"/> During this growth period Bloomberg News opened a small television station in New York, purchased New York Radio Station WNEW, launched fifteen-minute weekday business news programs for broadcast on [[PBS]] and opened offices in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Frankfurt, Germany]].<ref name="Bodine"/>

===1995–2000===
The initial goal of Bloomberg Business News to increase terminal sales was met by the mid-1990s and the company refocused the scope of its news service to rival the profitability of other media groups such as [[Reuters]] and [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]]. This led to the creation of Bloomberg's magazine, ''Bloomberg Personal,'' in 1995, which was carried in the Sunday edition of 18 U.S. papers.<ref name="Gale Group">{{cite book|last=Group|first=Gale|url=https://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?Ntt=7805587867677144810625576211998284400&N=197+4294916723&Ntk=P_EPI|title=International Directory of Company Histories Vol. 126|publisher=St. James Press|year=2011|isbn=9781558628083|edition=Casebound|location=[[Farmington Hills, Michigan]]}}</ref> In 1994, Bloomberg launched a 24-hour financial news service through [[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg Information Television]], which was broadcast on [[DirecTV]]. Bloomberg also launched a web site to provide the audio feed of its radio broadcasts.<ref name="Bodine"/> Bloomberg Business News was renamed Bloomberg News in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} 

===2000–2014===
In 2009 Bloomberg News and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' launched a global news service known as ''The Washington Post News Service with Bloomberg News'', to provide economic and political news.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Carr|first=David|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/28/business/media/28cbs.html|title=To Cover World, CBS Joins With a News Site|date=2009-09-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> 

In April 2014, Bloomberg News launched the ''Bloomberg Luxury'' lifestyle section of its paper.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://wwd.com/business-news/media/bloomberg-to-build-luxury-online-7653531/|title=Bloomberg to Build Luxury Online|magazine=[[Women's Wear Daily]]|date=2014-04-23}}</ref> The section's content covers topics including travel, wine news, dining, auto news, gadgets, technology news, and more. It also highlights content from Bloomberg's quarterly lifestyle and luxury magazine, ''Pursuits''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===2015 refocus===
In 2015, an internal memo written by editor-in-chief [[John Micklethwait]] was leaked to the public. This memo indicated an intent to refocus the agency to better target its core audience, "the clever customer who is short of time," and better achieve the goal of being "the definitive 'chronicle of capitalism.'"<ref name="Greenberg" /> This change led to a reduction in reporting on general interest topics in favor of content related to business and economics.<ref name="Greenberg"/>

===2018 redesign and paywall===
In 2018, Micklethwait announced a new digital design for Bloomberg News. Bloomberg uses a metered [[paywall]] to charge visitors for content, limiting users to view 10 free articles per month with unlimited re-read option, and 30 minutes of Bloomberg Television watch per day with reset at local midnight time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/bloombergs-new-paywall-will-charge-users-35-a-month-1525285030|title=Bloomberg's New Paywall Will Charge Users $35 a Month|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2018-05-02|author=Benjamin Mullin|accessdate=2019-02-16|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Bloomberg subscriptions|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/abgw2m846tx8qks/|last=|first=|date=|website=Bloomberg.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Michael Bloomberg presidential campaign ===
In November 2019, as [[Michael Bloomberg]] announced [[Michael Bloomberg 2020 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]], editor-in-chief [[John Micklethwait]] ordered his staff not to investigate their boss, nor any other [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates, while investigations into [[Donald Trump]] would continue, "as the government of the day".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/24/bloomberg-news-will-not-investigate-mike-bloomberg-or-his-democratic-rivals-during-primary.html |title=Bloomberg News will not investigate Mike Bloomberg or his Democratic rivals during primary |work=[[CNBC]] |first1=Lauren |last1=Hirsch |first2=Brian |last2=Schwartz |date=November 24, 2019 |access-date=November 26, 2019}}</ref> Subsequent reporting said Micklewait was referring to a team of specialized investigative reporters, as opposed to the overall political team, but he would not elaborate or issue a public clarification despite newsroom staff wishing for him to do so. Investigative journalists and political reporters operate separately but reporting indicates this distinction would not be clear to the general public.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Grynbaum|first=Michael M.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/bloomberg-news-conflict-of-interest.html|title=Bloomberg News's Dilemma: How to Cover a Boss Seeking the Presidency|date=2020-02-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Following Bloomberg's announcement, the Houston Chronicle dropped Bloomberg as a source for the 2020 Presidential campaign, saying that "journalists should not choose targets based on their political affiliation."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/474333-houston-chronicle-stops-using-bloomberg-news-wire-stories-for-campaign|title=Houston Chronicle stops using Bloomberg News wire stories for campaign coverage|first=Justin|last=Wise|date=December 12, 2019|website=TheHill}}</ref> Former Bloomberg News DC Bureau Chief Megan Murphy also criticized the decision, saying it bars "talented reporters and editors from covering massive, crucial aspects of one of the defining elections of our time" and calling the decision to avoid coverage "not journalism".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/meganmurp/status/1198665230273974272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/bloomberg-news-not-investigating-bloomberg-democrats|title=It is truly staggering that *any* editor would put their name on a memo that bars an army of unbelievably talented reporters and editors from covering massive, crucial aspects of one of the defining elections of our time. Staggering.|first=Megan|last=Murphy|date=November 24, 2019}}</ref> Responding to the controversy, [[Michael Bloomberg]] told CBS News: “We just have to learn to live with some things." He added that his reporters “get a paycheck. But with your paycheck comes some restrictions and responsibilities.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/bloomberg-news-reporters-accept-restrictions-67554419|title=Bloomberg: His news reporters need to accept restrictions|website=ABC News}}</ref>

Bloomberg suspended his campaign on March 4, 2020, the day after Super Tuesday.

==Controversy==
===China coverage===
Bloomberg News received a 2012 [[George Polk Awards|George Polk Award]] for its series of stories about China's political elite, "Revolution to Riches."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liu.edu/About/News/Univ-Ctr-PR/2013/February/UC_PR-Feb18-2|title=George Polk Awards|website=[[Long Island University]]|date=2013-02-18|accessdate=2018-01-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://topics.bloomberg.com/revolution-to-riches/|title=Revolution to Riches|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=2014-07-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231142229/http://topics.bloomberg.com/revolution-to-riches|archivedate=2012-12-31}}</ref>

One story in the series focused on the family wealth of Chinese leader [[Xi Jinping]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-29/xi-jinping-millionaire-relations-reveal-fortunes-of-elite.html|title=Xi Jinping Millionaire Relations Reveal Fortunes of Elite|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=2012-06-29|url-access=subscription|accessdate=2014-11-09}}</ref> Journalist and author [[Howard W. French]] reported in the May/June 2014 issue of the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' that prior to publication of the Xi story, high-level Bloomberg officials met with Chinese diplomats twice without informing the journalists who were working on the story.<ref name="French">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.cjr.org/feature/bloombergs_folly.php|title=Bloomberg's Folly|magazine=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=2014-05-01|author=Howard W. French|accessdate=2014-12-07}}</ref>

The first meeting was between Winkler and [[Zhang Yesui]], the [[Chinese ambassador to the United States]]. Zhang is said to have told Winkler, "If Bloomberg publishes this story, bad things will happen for Bloomberg in China. If Bloomberg does not publish the story, good things will happen for Bloomberg." The second meeting occurred shortly after in New York and included Bloomberg Chairman [[Peter Grauer]], the company's then Chief Executive [[Daniel Doctoroff]], and an unnamed Chinese diplomat.

Around the time of the second meeting, during a lengthy conference call with Bloomberg reporters and editors, Doctoroff insisted on changes in the story that softened its impact by revising the language used to describe the Xi family's assets.<ref name="French"/>

After the Xi story appeared, terminal sales in China slowed because government officials ordered state enterprises not to subscribe. The Bloomberg News website was also blocked on Chinese servers, and the company was unable to get visas for journalists it wanted to send to China.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/world/asia/reporter-on-unpublished-bloomberg-article-is-suspended.html|title=Bloomberg News Suspends Reporter Whose Article on China Was Not Published|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-11-17|author1=Edward Wong|author2=Christine Haughney|issn=0362-4331|authorlink1=Edward Wong|accessdate=2019-02-16|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2014, Grauer told the staff at the Bloomberg Hong Kong bureau that the company's sales team had done a "heroic job" of mending relations with Chinese officials who had indicated their displeasure about the publication of the Xi revelations. He also warned that if Bloomberg "were to do anything like" the Xi story again, the company would "be straight back in the shit-box."<ref name="French"/>

On October 29, 2013, during a conference call, Winkler told four Bloomberg journalists in Hong Kong that the findings of their major investigation into "the hidden financial ties between one of the wealthiest men in China and the families of top Chinese leaders" would not be published. Less than a week later, a second planned article "about the children of senior Chinese officials employed by foreign banks" was also killed, according to Bloomberg employees.<ref name="nytimes-2013-11-09">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/world/asia/bloomberg-news-is-said-to-curb-articles-that-might-anger-china.html|title=Bloomberg News Is Said to Curb Articles That Might Anger China|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2013-11-08|author=Edward Wong|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=2019-02-16|language=en-US}}</ref>

Unnamed Bloomberg employees quoted by ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the decision not to publish was made by the company's top editors, led by Winkler. According to one employee, Winkler said, "If we run the story, we'll be kicked out of China."<ref name="nytimes-2013-11-09"/><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=Folkenflik|first=David|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/04/14/828565428/bloomberg-news-killed-investigation-fired-reporter-then-sought-to-silence-his-wi|title=Bloomberg News Killed Investigation, Fired Reporter, Then Sought To Silence His Wife|date=April 14, 2020|work=[[NPR]]|access-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

When contacted by the Times, Winkler said in an email that neither story had been killed. "'What you have is untrue,'" he wrote. "'The stories are active and not spiked.'" [[Laurie Hays]], the senior editor on the articles, "echoed" his statement. Winkler declined to discuss the conference call.<ref name="nytimes-2013-11-09"/>

The Winkler and Hays denials appeared in a story published by the Times on November 8, 2013. At a mayoral news conference four days later, Michael Bloomberg also denied the accusation. He "insisted" that Bloomberg News "did not do that; the editors said that was just not the case." Noting Winkler's response to the Times, he added, "No one thinks that we are wusses and not willing to stand up and write stories that are of interest to the public and that are factually correct." He also said that because he was mayor of New York, he was not involved in the operations of the news agency. "I've recused myself from anything to do with the company," he said.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/business/media/bloomberg-says-news-service-did-not-kill-articles-on-china.html|title=Bloomberg Says News Service Did Not Kill Articles on China|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2013-11-12|author=Ben Sisario|issn=0362-4331|authorlink=Ben Sisario|accessdate=2019-02-16|language=en-US}}</ref>

He also said that the company has threatened the journalists who worked on the story with legal action if they discuss the incident publicly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimromenesko.com/2014/03/24/ben-richardson-quits-bloomberg-news-over-handling-of-investigative-piece/|title=Ben Richardson Quits Bloomberg News Over Handling of Investigative Piece|website=JimRomenesko.com|date=2014-03-24|author=Jim Romenesko|authorlink=Jim Romenesko|accessdate=2014-06-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200811/http://jimromenesko.com/2014/03/24/ben-richardson-quits-bloomberg-news-over-handling-of-investigative-piece/|archivedate=2014-06-02}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

Taiwan-based [[Next Media Animation]] produced an animated cartoon ridiculing Winkler and Michael Bloomberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/animated-take-on-bloombergs-coverage-of-china/|title=Animated Take on Bloomberg's Coverage of China|work=Sinosphere Blog|via=The New York Times|date=2013-11-08|author=Edward Wong|accessdate=2019-02-16|language=en-US}}</ref>

According to French, Bloomberg's handling of the episode "has tainted its corporate identity and journalism brand to a degree that could last for years."<ref name="French"/>

===Vinci reporting fine===

On December 16, 2019, France's financial markets watchdog, the [[Autorité des marchés financiers (France)|Autorité des marchés financiers]] (AMF), fined Bloomberg €5,000,000 for a report based on a fake news release that triggered a plunge in the shares of French construction giant Vinci and wiped billions off its market value. The AMF said Bloomberg distributed "information that it should have known was false" and that Bloomberg did not respect journalistic ethics "as no verification of the information was undertaken before publication".<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/fake-news-report-costs-bloomberg-76m-in-fines |title= Fake news report costs Bloomberg $7.6m in fines|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=2019-12-17|accessdate=2019-12-23}}</ref>
