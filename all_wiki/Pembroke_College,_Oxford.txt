'''Pembroke College''' is one of the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|constituent colleges]] of the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]], located in [[Pembroke Square, Oxford|Pembroke Square]]. The college was founded in 1624 by [[King James I of England]], using in part the endowment of merchant [[Thomas Tesdale]], and was named after [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], [[Lord Chamberlain]] and then-Chancellor of the University.<ref name=History>{{cite web| url=https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/About/History/index.php| title=History| website=www.pmb.ox.ac.uk| language=en| accessdate=10 October 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618055953/http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/About/History/index.php| archive-date=2013-06-18| url-status=dead}}</ref>

Like many of Oxford's colleges, Pembroke admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, having previously accepted men only.<ref name=History/> As of 2019, Pembroke had an estimated [[financial endowment]] of £63 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/pembroke_college_annual_report_and_financial_statements_31st_july_2019_04.12.19.pdf |title=Annual Report and Financial Statements|website=www.pmb.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> Pembroke offers the study of almost all the courses offered by the university.

[[Ernest Ryder|Sir Ernest Ryder]], a former Lord Justice of Appeal, has been Master of the College since July 2020.<ref>https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/news/sir-ernest-ryder-elected-next-master</ref>

==History==
===Foundation and origins===
In the early seventeenth century, the endowment of [[Thomas Tesdale]], a merchant from nearby [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], and [[Richard Wightwick]], the parish priest of [[Donnington, Shropshire]], enabled the conversion of Broadgates Hall, which had been a University hostel for law students since its construction in the fifteenth century, to form the basis of a fully-fledged college. The [[letters patent]] to found the college were signed by [[James I of England|King James I]] in 1624, with the college being named after [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], [[Lord Chamberlain]], Chancellor of the University,<ref name=History/> and rumoured patron of [[William Shakespeare]].

===Coat of arms===
The arms of Pembroke College were granted by the [[College of Arms|College of Heralds]] on 14 February 1625, the formal [[blazon]] describing it as:

:''“Per pale [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] and [[gules]] three Lyons [[Charge (heraldry)|rampant]], two and one, [[Argent]], in a Cheife party per pale Argent and [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], in the first a Rose Gules, seeded or, barbed vert in second a Thistle of Scotland proper”.''

Both [[James I]], as founder of the college, and the Earl of Pembroke are commemorated in the arms. The former, representing the union of the crowns as James I of England and [[James VI]] of Scotland, is symbolised by the rose (of England) and the thistle (of Scotland). The three lions rampant are taken from the Earl’s personal coat arms.

==Buildings==
[[File:Pembroke College quad.jpg|thumb|left|Old Quad, with [[Tom Tower]] in the distance]]
[[File:Pembroke Lodge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The entrance to Pembroke College in [[Pembroke Square, Oxford|Pembroke Square]]. [[Samuel Johnson]] had rooms on the second floor above the entrance, as an undergraduate in 1728.]]

===Old quad===
Following its foundation, the college proceeded to expand around Broadgates, building what is now known as "Old Quad" in the 1600s. Built in stages through the seventeenth century out of the local [[Cotswolds|Cotswold]] [[limestone]], space restrictions saw the south-side of the Quad built directly on top of the old City Wall. 

===Chapel quad===
A Chapel was built in 1732, and the introduction of further accommodation in 1846, and the Hall in 1848 to designs by Exeter-based architect [[John Hayward (architect)|John Hayward]]<ref>Oxford: an architectural guide, Geoffrey Tyack. {{ISBN|0-19-817423-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-817423-3}}</ref> created "Chapel Quad"—widely considered one of the most beautiful Quads in the University.<ref name="Buildings">{{cite web| url=http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/College/Buildings/index.php| title=Buildings - Pembroke College, University of Oxford| accessdate=2007-11-10| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501040437/http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/College/Buildings/index.php| archivedate=2008-05-01}}</ref> The Chapel was designed and built by William Townsend, although the interior was dramatically redesigned by [[Charles Kempe]]—a Pembroke graduate—in 1884. Pembroke alumnus Dr. Damon Wells is a significant benefactor of the college over many years: he enabled the restoration of the Chapel in 1972 and continues to support the Chaplaincy and History Fellowship. The Chapel which is still used for regular worship bears his name.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/College/The_Chapel/Chapel_History.php| title=Chapel History - Pembroke College, University of Oxford| accessdate=2007-11-10| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515054641/http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/College/The_Chapel/Chapel_History.php| archivedate=2008-05-15}}</ref>

===North quad===
Further expansion of the college came in the 1960s, after the closure of Beef Lane to the north of Chapel Quad. The private houses north of the closed road were acquired by the college in a piecemeal fashion and reversed so that access was only possible from the rear. The area is now known as "North Quad" and was formally opened in 1962.<ref name="Buildings"/>

===Rokos quad===
[[File:UK-2014-Oxford-Pembroke College 05.jpg|thumb|The bridge connecting Pembroke's new quad with the Chapel quadrangle]]
In April 2013 the [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]] officially opened a new quadrangle named for the lead donor [[Chris Rokos]]<ref name="Rokos awards">{{cite web|url=https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/news/pembroke-undergraduates-support-cutting-edge-research-through-inaugural-rokos-awards |title=Pembroke Undergraduates Support Cutting-Edge Research Through Inaugural Rokos Awards Internships  |publisher=pmb.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref> The new buildings include a 170-seat multi-purpose auditorium, a new cafe, art gallery, and teaching and function rooms.  The development is physically joined to the college's existing city-centre site via a new bridge crossing [[Brewer Street, Oxford|Brewer Street]] and the original medieval city wall, and 'landing' in the old fellows' garden adjacent to Chapel Quad.  Having historically been one of the university's physically smaller colleges, following the opening of the new building, undergraduates are now able to live in college premises for all years of study; postgraduates benefit from more rooms, and six flats for those with partners.<ref name="BGS Architects">{{cite web|url=http://www.bgsarchitects.co.uk/projects/brewer-street-project-pembroke-college-oxford/ |title=Brewer Street Project |publisher=bgsarchitects.co.uk |access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref>

===Geoffrey Arthur Building=== 
A modern annexe, built near to college on the banks of the [[River Thames|Isis]] at [[Grandpont, Oxford|Grandpont]], provides accommodation for thirty-six graduates and around forty undergraduates. Named the Geoffrey Arthur Building (commonly referred to as "The GAB"), the building was named for the diplomat Sir [[Geoffrey Arthur]]—a former master of the college (1975–1985).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/College/Buildings/Geoffrey_Arthur_Building.php| title=Geoffrey Arthur Building - Pembroke College, Oxford| accessdate=2007-11-10| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524020250/http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/College/Buildings/Geoffrey_Arthur_Building.php| archivedate=2008-05-24}}</ref>

==Admissions==
Pembroke offers a broad range of courses, covering almost all the subject areas offered by the university; [[Literae Humaniores]] (Classics), [[Geography]] and [[Computer Science]] are notable exceptions. In particular, the college has had a strong involvement with [[Economics]], as well as [[Management Studies]], being the first traditional Oxford college to appoint a [[Fellow]] in the field.<ref name="E&M">{{cite web|url= http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/Students/Admissions/Courses/Economics_and_Management.php?courseId=7|title= Pembroke College Course Guide: Economics & Management|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131022144216/http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/Students/Admissions/Courses/Economics_and_Management.php?courseId=7|archivedate= 2013-10-22}}</ref> The college has maintained a close relationship with the [[Saïd Business School]].

In March 2002 two Pembroke fellows resigned after allegations that they had offered a place to the fictional child of an undercover reporter in return for a donation to the college library. The journalist had taped a conversation where he posed as the father of a fictitious son.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1388770/Two-quit-in-Oxford-cash-for-places-scandal.html|title=2002 Admissions Scandal | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=David | last=Graves | date=2002-03-25 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

Pembroke runs its own access schemes entitled 'Pem-Brooke' and 'Pembroke North' which work with disadvantaged students from London and areas of the North. These schemes provide students with long-term academically intensive programmes, which will give students important skills that will support them with both Oxbridge applications but also [[Russell Group]] university applications.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/library/Documents/Students/access-folder-final-low-res.pdf|title=Access Programme 2012-2016 | work=Pembroke College | location=Oxford | accessdate=2017-01-20}}</ref>

===Junior and Middle Common Rooms===
Pembroke is home to a [[Junior Common Room]] (undergraduate community) notable for its artistic wealth and sporting prowess. The JCR is the wealthiest in Oxford due to the purchase and sale of a [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] painting in the early 20th century; it was bought in 1953 for £150 and sold for £400,000 in 1997.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pembrokejcr.org/?page_id=747| title=Pembroke College JCR Art: A Bit of History| access-date=11 July 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234753/http://www.pembrokejcr.org/?page_id=747| archive-date=3 March 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref> The JCR has used those funds to support a student support scheme and an artistic acquisition programme.

The Middle Common Room, for postgraduates, is housed in a suite of historic mahogany-panelled rooms.

===Sport===
The college has a strong sporting reputation across the university. Recent years have seen the JCR achieve particular success at [[Rugby Union|rugby]], [[cricket]], [[football (soccer)|football]], [[hockey]] and [[darts]]. In 2018, Pembroke made history by becoming the first college to win two rugby honours in one year, with the women's team winning Cuppers, and the men's team winning the Cuppers Bowl. 2018 also saw Pembroke win Cuppers in mixed netball and futsal. The MCR has been particularly strong at women's boxing, [[polo]] and cricket. Despite being a newly formed team, Pembroke has also done well in pool, reaching the semifinals in the 2015 Pool Cuppers.

[[Pembroke College Boat Club (Oxford)|Pembroke College Boat Club]] is one of Oxford's strongest boat clubs, in 2013 holding both the [[Torpids]] and [[Eights Week|Summer Eights]] men's headship, with the women's 1st boat sitting at 4th and 7th places respectively. In 2016, the men held Head of the River in Torpids and 4th in Summer Eights, and the women held 3rd and 2nd for Torpids and Summer Eights respectively. Pembroke Men's 2nd Torpids also bumped five places up to 11th in Division 1—the first time there have been two men's boats from a single college in over 40 years. Pembroke has been the top club in aggregate points across all boats for three years running.<ref>See [https://web.archive.org/web/20150904115001/http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/rowing/points/] for points tables.</ref> In 2003, Pembroke became the first college ever to win the "Double Headship Trophy" for having both men's and women's Eights head the river. In 2018, the Pembroke Women's 1st boat again achieved the Summer Eights headship.

[[File:Dr Johnson's desk.jpg|thumb|right|[[Samuel Johnson]]'s desk, in Broadgates]]

[[Samuel Johnson]] was one of the college's more famous alumni, though he did not complete his degree (he was later awarded an honorary degree by the University); lack of funds forced him to leave Oxford after about a year and a half. Two of his desks and various other possessions are displayed around the college.  He spoke fondly of Pembroke to his death, recalling especially the college's many poets, telling friends that ‘we were a nest of singing birds.'<ref>https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42960/42960-h/42960-h.htm</ref> [[James Smithson]], whose bequest founded the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (despite him never having visited the [[United States]]) was an undergraduate at Pembroke, under the name "James Lewis Macie"—he changed his name to that of his natural father after the death of his mother. Meanwhile, Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], who established the [[Fulbright Program]], was a [[Rhodes Scholar]] at Pembroke in the 1920s.

====Diplomacy====
[[Thomas Randolph (diplomat)|Thomas Randolph]], principal of Pembroke's precursor mediaeval hall, Broadgates, served as ambassador for [[Elizabeth I]] in Scotland from 1559, where he acquired the friendship of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], until he was accused of supporting the rebellion of [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Thomas_Randolph_(poet).aspx |title=Thomas Randolph (poet) Facts, information, pictures &#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about Thomas Randolph (poet) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2013-04-27}}</ref>  In 1568 he was sent to Russia to secure trading rights from [[Ivan IV]], better known as Ivan the terrible, and succeeded in winning valuable access to Russia for English merchants.

More recently, [[John Kerr, Baron Kerr of Kinlochard]], served as UK Ambassador to the United States from 1995 to 1997, before being appointed Head of the [[British Foreign and Commonwealth Office]].  [[Philip Lader]] served as US Ambassador to the UK from 1997 to 2001.  Thus in 1997, both the US Ambassador in London and the UK Ambassador in Washington were former Pembroke students. Sir [[Peter Ricketts]] also served as head of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 2006 until 2010, and was then British Ambassador to France for six years until his retirement in 2016.

Additionally, two former chairs of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] Senator [[Richard Lugar|Richard G. Lugar]], (Republican), and Senator [[J. William Fulbright]] (Democrat), were students of Pembroke, between them chairing the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] for a 27-year period.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B01IuzJJ3MEC&q=richard+lugar+pembroke%2F&pg=PA199 |title=The next American century: essays in honor of Richard G.

Beyond the transatlantic, the Prime Minister of Hungary, [[Viktor Orbán]], Polish Foreign Minister and an MEP [[Radek Sikorski]], the Sultan of Oman, [[Haitham bin Tariq Al Said]], and [[King Abdullah II of Jordan]] all studied at Pembroke.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arabnews.com/node/1611351/middle-east|title=Haitham bin Tariq appointed new ruler of Oman|website=Arab News|date=11 January 2020}}</ref>

===Fellows===
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was a [[Fellow]] of Pembroke from 1925 to 1945, and wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the first two volumes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' during his time there. Since 2013 the college has held an [[The J.R.R. Tolkien Lecture on Fantasy Literature|annual lecture on fantasy literature]] in his honour.<ref>[http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/content/tolkien-lecture-series Tolkien Lecture Series], ''Pembroke College, Oxford.'' Retrieved 2017-06-20.</ref>  [[R. G. Collingwood|Robin G.
