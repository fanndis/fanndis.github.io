She would occasionally stay with her maternal grandmother.<ref name="Morris2016" />

==Career==
===2012–2014: Career beginnings===
Frangipane started writing music when she was 17, and in 2012, she began posting videos to social media sites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Kik Messenger|Kik]], and in particular [[Tumblr]], under the username ''se7enteenblack''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2618129/thank-you-halsey-fangirl/|title=Thank You, Halsey, For Being A Fangirl Just Like Me|last=Lakshmin|first=Deepa|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=December 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224024123/http://www.mtv.com/news/2618129/thank-you-halsey-fangirl/|archive-date=December 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She became known for a parody of [[Taylor Swift]]'s song "[[I Knew You Were Trouble]]", inspired by Swift's relationship with [[Harry Styles]].

The result, a song about her ex-boyfriend, titled "[[Ghost (Halsey song)|Ghost]]", was posted by Frangipane on [[SoundCloud]] several weeks after it was recorded. Within hours, the song gained online popularity and she was subsequently contacted by several record labels, with the song eventually charting and going on radio. She signed with [[Astralwerks]], feeling that they gave her more creative freedom than other labels that contacted her.<ref name="Morris2016" />
