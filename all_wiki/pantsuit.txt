A '''pantsuit''' or '''pant suit''', also known as a '''trouser suit''' outside the [[United States]], is a woman's [[suit (clothes)|suit]] of [[clothing]] consisting of [[pants]] and a matching or coordinating [[coat (clothing)|coat or jacket]].

Formerly, the prevailing fashion for women included some form of a coat,  paired with a skirt or dress—hence the name ''pantsuit''.

==History==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 199919 Young woman modelling a short pantsuit, Brisbane, 1952.jpg|thumb|Young woman modelling a short pantsuit, [[Brisbane]], 1952 The model wears a short-sleeved, collared blouse with front patch pockets, teamed with a pair of high-waisted, tailored shorts with slit pockets. She also wears a cloth hat and a pair of high-ankled sandals. This style is typical of the post-war period in women's clothing, when menswear style shirts, shorts and pants became popular in women's fashion.]]

The pantsuit was introduced in the 1920s, when a small number of women [[1920s in Western fashion#The boyish figure|adopted a masculine style]], including pantsuits, [[hat]]s, [[Walking stick|canes]] and [[monocle]]s. However, the term, "trouser suit" had been used in Britain during the [[First World War]], with reference to women working in heavy industry.<ref>Henrietta Heald, 'For England's Sake', ''History Today'', October 2014, page 33</ref>

During the 1960s pant suits for women became increasingly widespread. Designers such as [[Foale and Tuffin]] in London and [[Luba Marks]] in the United States were early promoters of trouser suits.<ref name=V&A_02>{{cite web|title=Marion Foale & Sally Tuffin|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/marion-foale-and-sally-tuffin/|website=V&A|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=eugenia>{{cite news |last1=Sheppard |first1=Eugenia |authorlink1=Eugenia Sheppard |title=Ballerina is Heroine of Medium Price Coat |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2026662/the_daily_timesnews/ |accessdate=20 March 2015 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |work=The Daily Times-News, Burlington |date=12 September 1966}}</ref> In 1966 [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] introduced his [[Le Smoking]], an evening pantsuit for women that mimicked a man's [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]].<ref name="alexander">Alexander, Hilary.

Pantsuits were often deprecated as inappropriately masculine clothing for women. For example, until 1993, women were not permitted to wear pantsuits (or pants of any kind) on the [[United States Senate]] floor.<ref>Robin Givhan (20 July 2007) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/19/AR2007071902668.html "Hillary Clinton's Tentative Dip Into New Neckline Territory"] ''Washington Post''</ref><ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com">{{cite web |author=Robin Givhan |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-01-21/features/0401210033_1_carol-moseley-braun-wore-jacket |title=Moseley Braun: Lady in red |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2004-01-21 |accessdate=2016-11-10}}</ref><ref name="rollcall">{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=Cassandra|title=The Long and Short of Capitol Style|url=http://www.rollcall.com/features/50th-Anniversary_2005/fifty_anniversary/-9592-1.html|publisher=Roll Call|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140726010220/http://www.rollcall.com/features/50th-Anniversary_2005/fifty_anniversary/-9592-1.html|archivedate=2014-07-26|date=2005-06-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1993, Senators [[Barbara Mikulski]] and [[Carol Moseley Braun]] wore pants onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms [[Martha Pope]] to allow women to wear pants on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket, thus allowing pantsuits, among other types of clothing.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/><ref name="rollcall"/> 

[[Hillary Clinton]], who is well known for wearing pantsuits, once referred to her presidential campaign staff as "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pantsuits" (in her August 26, 2008 speech at the Democratic National Convention), a play on ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=AUG. 26, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/us/politics/26text-clinton.html?pagewanted=print&_r=0 |title=Hillary Rodham Clinton's Democratic Convention Speech - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2008-08-26 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref>

During the 2016 Presidential election, the pantsuit became a symbolic rallying cry among supporters of Hillary Clinton, many of whom donned pantsuits when they went to the polls to cast their ballots. This was in part due to the influence of a [[Facebook]] group of 2.9 million Hillary Clinton supporters called [[Pantsuit Nation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/10/07/pantsuit-power-flashmob-video-for-hillary-clinton-two-women-170-dancers-no-police/|title='Pantsuit Power' flashmob video for Hillary Clinton: Two women, 170 dancers and no police|last=Kaufman|first=Sarah L.|date=2016-10-07|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/politics/hillary-clinton-pantsuit-flash-mob-nyc/|title=Hillary Clinton Pantsuit Flash Mob Hits NYC|date=2016-10-07|newspaper=PEOPLE.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/7/hillary-clinton-pantsuit-power-activists-flashmob-/|title=Hillary Clinton 'Pantsuit Power' activists flashmob to Justin Timberlake song in NYC|last=Ernst|first=Douglas|newspaper=The Washington Times|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-flash-mob-union-square_us_57f3075ce4b01b16aafeab04|title=Hillary Clinton-Inspired Flash Mob Is Pro-Pantsuit, Anti-Donald Trump|last=Herreria|first=Carla|date=2016-10-04|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref>
