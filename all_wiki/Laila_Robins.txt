===Theatre===
Robins appeared as Lady Utterword in the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]]'s revival of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Heartbreak House]]'' (2006). Robins' other Broadway appearances were ''[[Frozen (play)|Frozen]]'' by [[Bryony Lavery]] (2004), ''[[The Herbal Bed]]'' by [[Peter Whelan]] (1998), and ''[[The Real Thing (play)|The Real Thing]]'' by [[Tom Stoppard]] (1985), directed by [[Mike Nichols]]. (Robins succeeded actress [[Glenn Close]] in the role).

Robins has appeared [[Off-Broadway]] in ''Sore Throats'' by [[Howard Brenton]], ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]], ''Mrs. Klein'' by Nicholas Wright (in which she also toured with [[Uta Hagen]]) (1995–1996), ''Burnt Piano'' by [[Justin Fleming]] and ''The Film Society'' by [[Jon Robin Baitz]], among others.

In 1997, she starred in the Fiftieth Anniversary production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago. Robins also appeared as [[Cleopatra]] in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' at the [[Guthrie Theater]] in Minneapolis in 2002. In 2000, she was cast opposite [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] in the stage revival of ''Tiny Alice''. Robins is also a frequent performer at the [[Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey]], where she has starred in ''Macbeth'', ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''.

[[Charles Isherwood]], critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', assessed her stage work as Ariadne in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Heartbreak House]]'' (2006). Robins played opposite [[Swoosie Kurtz]], and Isherwood described both as such: "...this expert comic actress [Kurtz] may not fit the textbook definition of ''siren,'' as Hesione is called, but she may just be the most seductive woman on a New York stage right now...unless that nod goes to Ms. Robins, who locates the essence of her character's shallow allure in a languid, liquid strut and a smile both entrancing and devouring".<ref>[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9B07E1DD1030F931A25753C1A9609C8B63&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FS%2FShaw%2C%20George%20Bernard "THEATER REVIEW; British Gentry, Fiddling While the Abyss Looms"] October 12, 2006, ''The New York Times''</ref>
