During his childhood, Maguire entertained the idea of becoming a chef and wanted to enroll in a home economics class as a sixth grader. His mother offered him $100 to take a drama class instead, and he agreed.<ref name="Thoughtful1">[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/02/ca.s02.tobey.maguire/ Tobey Maguire: A Thoughtful ''Spider-Man''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305095238/http://edition.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/02/ca.s02.tobey.maguire/ |date=March 5, 2016 }}, published May 2, 2002; retrieved May 1, 2007.</ref> The transient nature of his school years began to take a toll on Maguire emotionally, and after another relocation for his freshman year, he dropped out of high school and did not return.

==Career==
Maguire's first appearance in a feature film was in 1989's ''[[The Wizard (1989 film)|The Wizard]]''. He plays one of Lucas Barton's goons (one of three competitors at a video game competition) and had no lines. He worked as a child actor in the early 1990s, often playing roles much younger than his chronological age, and as late as 2002 he was still playing teenagers while in his mid-20s. He appeared in a variety of [[commercials]] and TV and movie roles, working opposite such actors as [[Chuck Norris]] (''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]''), [[Roseanne Barr]] (''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''), and [[Tracey Ullman]] (''[[Tracey Takes On...]]''). Eventually, he was cast as the lead in the FOX TV series ''[[Great Scott! (TV series)|Great Scott!]]'', which was canceled five weeks later.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

During many of his auditions, Maguire found himself auditioning for roles opposite another rising actor, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. The pair quickly became friends and made an informal pact to help each other get parts in their movies/TV shows/other projects. For example, both auditioned for the same part in the [[Parenthood (1990 TV series)|1990 TV series]] based on the 1989 comedy ''[[Parenthood (1989 film)|Parenthood]]''. DiCaprio was cast, and Maguire later got a guest role at least partly on DiCaprio's recommendation. The same scenario played itself out during casting for the 1993 movie ''[[This Boy's Life (film)|This Boy's Life]]'' (featuring [[Robert De Niro]] as the lead); DiCaprio got the main teen role (coincidentally, the character was named "Toby") and Maguire got a part as one of Toby's friends.<ref>Conversations with Leonardo di Caprio September 23, 2014, SAG Foundation</ref>

By the mid-1990s, he was working steadily but was also becoming involved in the hard-partying lifestyle of some of his fellow young actors. In 1995, he requested director [[Allan Moyle]] to release him from his part in the movie ''[[Empire Records]]''. Moyle agreed, and all of Maguire's scenes were deleted from the final film.<ref name="AskMen1">[http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_150/150c_tobey_maguire.html Men of the Week in Entertainment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007175339/http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_150/150c_tobey_maguire.html |date=October 7, 2008 }}; retrieved May 14, 2007.</ref> Maguire then sought help for a [[alcoholism|drinking problem]] from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]; he has been sober ever since.<ref name="AA">[http://www.addictioninfo.org/articles/1463/1/Tobey-Maguire-reveals-AA-meetings/Page1.html Tobey Maguire Reveals AA Meetings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190915/http://www.addictioninfo.org/articles/1463/1/Tobey-Maguire-reveals-AA-meetings/Page1.html |date=July 29, 2016 }}, published April 12, 2007; retrieved May 14, 2007.</ref>

As part of his recovery from alcoholism and learning to deal with his self-described "addictive and compulsive nature",<ref name="AA" /> Maguire changed his career path slightly to obtain roles where he and DiCaprio would not always be in competition for the same part, and the move paid off when given the role of Paul Hood, a teenage boarding school student whose narration anchors the action, in [[Ang Lee]]'s 1997 film, ''[[The Ice Storm (film)|The Ice Storm]].'' This led to a variety of lead roles in films such as ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]'', ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'', and ''[[Wonder Boys (film)|Wonder Boys]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In the 1998 film ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' he portrayed a hitchhiker who meets [[Raoul Duke]] and [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Dr. Gonzo]] during their drive to Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blair|first=Andrew|title=Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/19059/looking-back-at-terry-gilliam%E2%80%99s-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>

In ''[[Ride with the Devil (film)|Ride with the Devil]]'' (1999), Maguire portrayed Jakob Roedel, opposite [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel Kilcher]]. Here he played the son of a unionist German immigrant who joins his southern friends in the Missouri riders, avenging the atrocities committed against Missourians by Kansas [[Jayhawker]]s and redleggers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Ride with the Devil|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ride-with-the-devil-1999|accessdate=June 18, 2013|date=December 17, 1999}}</ref>

In 2001, Maguire took a role that featured his youthful-sounding voice, a beagle puppy named Lou, in the family movie ''[[Cats & Dogs]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cats & Dogs (2001)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Cats-Dogs-Alec-Baldwin/dp/B00005TOTC|accessdate=June 18, 2013|newspaper=Amazon}}</ref>

In 2002, Maguire starred in ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', based on the popular [[Marvel Comics]] superhero. The film was a major success and made him into a star. He reprised the role in the sequels ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004) and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007), and has also provided the voice of [[Spider-Man]] for the video game adaptations of the films.
