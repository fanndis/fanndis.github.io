==History==
As the Lancaster inheritance the estate dates to 1265, when [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] granted his younger son, [[Edmund Crouchback]], lands forfeited by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester]].{{cn|date=October 2020}} In 1266, the estates of [[Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby]],<ref name="oxford">{{cite encyclopedia|year=2004|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Maddicott|first=J.

Matthew, Brian Harrison}}<!--| accessdate=28 October 2007--></ref> another protagonist in the [[Second Barons' War]], were added. In 1267 the estate was granted as the County, Honour and Castle of Lancaster. In 1284 Edmund was given the [[Manor of Savoy]] by his mother, [[Eleanor of Provence]], the niece of the original grantee, [[Peter II, Count of Savoy]]. Edward III raised Lancashire into a [[county palatine]] in 1351,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and the holder, [[Henry of Grosmont]], Edmund's grandson, was created Duke of Lancaster.{{cn|date=October 2020}} After his death a charter of 1362 conferred the dukedom on his son-in-law [[John of Gaunt]], Earl of Lancaster, and the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten for ever.

In 1399 the [[Duke of Lancaster|Duchy of Lancaster]], held by John of Gaunt's son [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]], merged with the crown on his appropriation of the throne (after the dispossession from [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]). His first act as [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] was to declare that the Lancastrian inheritance be held separately from the other possessions of the Crown, and should descend to male heirs. This separation of identities was confirmed in 1461 by [[Edward IV]] when he incorporated the inheritance and the palatinate responsibilities under the title of the Duchy of Lancaster, and stipulated that it be held separate from other inheritances by him and his heirs, but would however be inherited with the Crown, to which it was forfeited on the [[attainder]] of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].<ref>[http://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-004/ Blackstone, W. (1765) ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', Introduction, chapter 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927001715/http://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-004/ |date=27 September 2016 }}. [[Sir William Blackstone]] described the duchy as "separate from the other possessions of the crown in order and government, but united in point of inheritance." (Footnote no. 78.)</ref> The Duchy thereafter passed to the reigning monarch, and in 1760 its separate identity preserved it from being surrendered with the [[Crown Estate]]s in exchange for the [[civil list]]. It is primarily a landed inheritance belonging to the reigning sovereign (now [[Elizabeth II]]).

In 2011, the Duchy established a rebalancing asset plan{{clarify|date=January 2017}} and sold most of the [[Winmarleigh]] estates farms in Lancashire, and donated a plot of land to the Winmarleigh Village Hall committee by June 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Duchy nears completion of Winmarleigh sales|url=http://www.duchyoflancaster.co.uk/2012/06/21/1219/|website=Duchy of Lancaster|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=21 June 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903063413/http://www.duchyoflancaster.co.uk/2012/06/21/1219/|archivedate=3 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=gc>{{cite news|title=Duchy land farm sell-off|url=http://www.garstangcourier.co.uk/news/local/duchy-land-farm-sell-off-1-3236795|accessdate=31 August 2014|work=Garstang Courier|date=31 March 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903112039/http://www.garstangcourier.co.uk/news/local/duchy-land-farm-sell-off-1-3236795|archivedate=3 September 2014}}</ref>

In 2017, the [[Paradise Papers]] revealed that the Duchy held investments in two [[offshore financial centre]]s, the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Bermuda]]. Both are [[British Overseas Territories]] of which [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is monarch, and nominally appoints governors. Britain handles foreign policy for both islands to a large extent, but Bermuda has been self-governing since 1620. The Duchy's investments included [[First Quench Retailing]] off-licences and [[rent-to-own]] retailer [[BrightHouse (retailer)|BrightHouse]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Osborne|first1=Hilary|title=Revealed: Queen's private estate invested millions of pounds offshore|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/revealed-queen-private-estate-invested-offshore-paradise-papers|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=5 November 2017|date=5 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105190200/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/revealed-queen-private-estate-invested-offshore-paradise-papers|archivedate=5 November 2017}}</ref> Labour Party Leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] posited whether the Queen should apologise, saying anyone with money offshore for tax avoidance should "not just apologise for it, [but] recognise what it does to our society". A spokesman for the Duchy said that all of their investments are audited and legitimate and that the Queen voluntarily pays taxes on income she receives from Duchy investments.<ref name=beeb>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41883472|publisher=BBC|title=Paradise Papers: Queen should apologise, suggests Corbyn|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107042716/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41883472|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>

==Role==
The chief officer is the [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], a position sometimes held by a cabinet minister but always a ministerial post. For at least the last two centuries the estate has been run by a deputy; its chancellor has rarely had any significant duties pertaining to its management but is available as a [[minister without portfolio]].

The monarch derives the [[privy purse]] from the revenues of the Duchy. The surplus for the year ended 31 March 2015 was £16 million and the Duchy was valued at just over £472 million.<ref name="investments">{{cite web| title=Accounts, Annual Reports and Investments| url=http://www.duchyoflancaster.com/management-and-finance-2/accounts-annual-reports-and-investments/| publisher=The Duchy of Lancaster| date=18 July 2011| accessdate=30 September 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012094537/http://www.duchyoflancaster.com/management-and-finance-2/accounts-annual-reports-and-investments/| archivedate=12 October 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Its land holdings are not to be confused with the [[Crown Estate]], whose revenues have been handed to the Treasury since the 18th century in exchange for the receipt of a yearly payment.

The Duchy Council's primary officers carrying out the estate's day-to-day duties are the Clerk of the Council (the Chief Executive Officer), the Chairman of the Council, and the Chief Finance Officer.<ref name=finance/> The chancellor is responsible for the appointment of the steward and the barmaster of the [[barmote court]]s on behalf of the Queen in right of Her Duchy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duchyoflancaster.com/duties-of-the-duchy/further-key-appointments/barmote-courts/ |title=Barmote Courts |date=26 January 2011 |publisher=Duchy of Lancaster |accessdate=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712214624/http://www.duchyoflancaster.com/duties-of-the-duchy/further-key-appointments/barmote-courts/ |archivedate=12 July 2011  }} ()</ref>

==Royal prerogative==
Both the Duchy of Lancaster and the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] have special legal rights not available to other estates held by [[peerage|peers]] or [[county palatine|counties palatine]], for example, ''[[bona vacantia]]'' operates to the advantage of the Duke rather than the Crown throughout the Duchy. Proceeds from ''bona vacantia'' in the Duchy are divided between two registered charities.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.duchyoflancaster.com/duties-of-the-duchy/further-key-appointments/benevolent-fund-trustees/| publisher=Duchy of Lancaster| title=Benevolent Fund Trustees| date=25 January 2011| accessdate=30 September 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108010449/http://www.duchyoflancaster.com/duties-of-the-duchy/further-key-appointments/benevolent-fund-trustees/| archivedate=8 November 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/5243170.stm| publisher=BBC News| title=Terraced house 'belongs to Queen'| date=3 August 2006| accessdate=3 January 2010| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314025049/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/5243170.stm| archivedate=14 March 2007| df=dmy-all}} – provides an example of ''bona vacantia'' operating in favour of the Duchy in [[Gorton]] in [[Manchester]].</ref> ''Bona vacantia'' arises, in origin, by virtue of the Royal Prerogative and in some respects remains the position although the right to ''bona vacantia'' of the two major categories is now based on statute: [[Administration of Estates Act 1925]]<ref>"In default of any person taking an absolute interest under the foregoing provisions, the residuary estate of the intestate shall belong to the Crown or to the Duchy of Lancaster or to the Duke of Cornwall for the time being, as the case may be, as bona vacantia, and in lieu of any right to escheat." Administration of Estates Act 1925 Section 46</ref> and the [[Companies Act 2006]].<ref>Section 1016 of the Companies Act 2006 defines the Crown Representative in relation to property vested in the Duchy of Lancaster, as being the Solicitor to that Duchy</ref>

There are separate [[Attorney General|attorneys general]] for the estates.  Generally the exemptions tend to follow the same line: any rights pertaining to the Crown in most areas of the country instead pertain to the Duke in the Duchy.  Generally, any [[Act of Parliament]] relating to rights of this kind will specifically set out special exemptions for the two Duchies and specify the extent to which they apply.  They are subject to strict regulation, especially with respect to [[auditing]] and [[Alienation (property law)|alienation]] of land.

==Holdings==
[[File:Duchy of Lancaster offices 2020.jpg|thumb|right|The Duchy of Lancaster headquarters office in Lancaster Place, London. It flies the Duchy flag.]]
The holdings of the Duchy are divided into six units called surveys, five rural and one urban. The rural surveys make up most of the assets and area but the urban survey generates a greater income. The holdings were accrued over time through marriage, inheritance, gift and confiscation, and in modern times by purchase and sale.<ref name="properties"/>
