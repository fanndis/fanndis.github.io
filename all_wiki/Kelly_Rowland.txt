== Career ==

=== 1997–2001: Destiny's Child ===
Taken from a passage in the Biblical [[Book of Isaiah]], the group changed their name to Destiny's Child, after signing to [[Columbia Records]] in 1997.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/24/beyonces-father-producing-destinys-child-musical-told-from-his-perspective</ref> That same year, Destiny's Child recorded their major label debut song "Killing Time", for the soundtrack to the 1997 film, ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]''.<ref>http://www.mtv.com/news/1504044/destinys-childs-long-road-to-fame-the-song-isnt-called-survivor-for-nothing/</ref> Later that year, the group released their debut single, "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]", and the following year, they released their [[Destiny's Child (album)|self-titled debut album]].<ref name="Farley" /> The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, amassing moderate sales and winning the group three [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards]]. The group rose to fame after releasing their multi-platinum second album ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'' in 1999.<ref name="mtvnews">{{cite web|title=Destiny's Child: Where did it all go wrong? |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/destinys_child/news_feature_061405/ |work=MTV News |date=March 13, 2000 |accessdate=July 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514040038/http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/destinys_child/news_feature_061405/ |archive-date=May 14, 2013 }}</ref> The album featured some of the group's most widely known songs such as "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]", "[[Jumpin' Jumpin']]" and "[[Say My Name]]", which became their most-successful song at the time, and would remain as one of their [[signature song]]s. "Say My Name" won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at the [[43rd Annual Grammy Awards]]. <ref>https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/destinys-child/13008</ref> ''The Writing's on the Wall'' sold more than 15 million copies worldwide,<ref name="Farley" /> essentially becoming their breakthrough album.<ref name="ASCAP">{{cite web|title=The Best in Hip hop/Soul |url=http://www.ascap.com/playback/2004/winter/hiphopsoul2.html |publisher=[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) |accessdate=April 2, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Anthony">{{cite news|last=Anthony|first=James|title=Of course you can lose yourself|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1852025,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 18, 2006|accessdate=April 16, 2008|location=London}}</ref>

[[File:Say My Name Live.jpg|thumb|right|[[Destiny's Child]] performing their 2000 hit "[[Say My Name]]" during their farewell concert tour, [[Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin' It]]]]
Along with their commercial successes, the group became entangled in much-publicized turmoil involving the filing of a lawsuit by Luckett and Roberson for breach of contract. The issue was heightened after [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Farrah Franklin]] appeared in the video of "Say My Name", implying that Luckett and Roberson had already been replaced. Eventually, Luckett and Roberson left the group. Franklin would eventually fade from the group after five months,<ref name="Farley" /> as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. She attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group resulting from the departure. After settling on their final lineup, the trio recorded "[[Independent Women Part I]]", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]''. It became their best-charting single, topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for eleven consecutive weeks. <ref name="ASCAP" /> The success cemented the new lineup and skyrocketed them to fame.<ref name="People" /> Later that year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former bandmates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging.

Later that year, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'', Rowland appeared on the remix of [[Avant (singer)|Avant]]'s single "[[Separated (song)|Separated]]". ''Survivor'', which channeled the turmoil the band underwent, spawned its [[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|lead single of the same name]], which was a response to the experience.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |title=Destiny's Child Use Turmoil To Fuel New LP |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435986/20010108/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=January 8, 2001 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> The song went on to win a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.<ref name="survivorgrammy">{{cite web|title=Destiny's Child Timeline |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-d/destinyschild.htm |work=Rockonthenet.com |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref> The themes of "Survivor", however, caused Luckett and Roberson to refile their lawsuit; the proceedings were eventually settled in June 2002.<ref name="Anthony" /> Meanwhile, the album was released in May 2001, debuting at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.<ref name="Martens3">{{cite web|last=Todd |first=Martens |title=Beyonce, Branch Albums Storm The Chart |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/70145/beyonce-branch-albums-storm-the-chart |work=Billboard |date=July 2, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> To date, ''Survivor'' has sold over twelve million copies worldwide, over forty percent of which were sold in the US alone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carpenter |first=Troy |title=Destiny's Child Slapped With Infringement Suit |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68539/destinys-child-slapped-with-infringement-suit |work=Billboard |date=October 22, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> The album also spawned the number-one hit "[[Bootylicious]]" on which Rowland sang lead vocals.
