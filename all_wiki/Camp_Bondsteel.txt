</ref> To construct the base, two hills were flattened and the valley between them was filled. In August 1999, 52 helipads were constructed on the facility's west perimeter to handle helicopter aviation. The camp is built mainly of wooden, semi permanent SEA (South East Asia) huts and is surrounded by a {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high earthen wall.

Camp Bondsteel was constructed by the 94th Engineer Construction Battalion, augmented by A Company, 864th Engineer Battalion, and the 568 Combat Support Engineer Company, together with the private [[Kellogg, Brown and Root]] Corporation (KBR). The planning, design and construction management of the project was completed by the Construction Management Section of the 130th Engineer Brigade and a team from the Baltimore District of the U.S. [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. KBR is also the prime contractor for the operation of the camp.

Camp Bondsteel has many facilities on base, all built with aid from the US military which are used by the soldiers and civilian employees who live and work there, and can hold up to 7,000 soldiers which makes it the largest US base in the Balkans. The post exchange (PX) is the largest military exchange in south eastern Europe and contains all the necessities and more that someone may need while in Kosovo, including TVs, phones, books, DVDs, CDs, small furniture, video games, computers, clothes, shoes, food, and more, all in its two-story building.<ref name=globalsec/><ref>{{cite web|title=Camp Bondsteel Army Base in Ferizaj, Kosovo|url=https://militarybases.com/overseas/kosovo/camp-bondsteel/|website=Military Bases|accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref> 

The base also has a hospital; two gyms; two recreation buildings that have phones, computers with internet connection, pool tables, video games and more; one chapel with various religious services and other activities; one large dining facility; a fire station; a military police station; two cappuccino bars, a [[Burger King]], [[Taco Bell]], and an [[Anthony's Pizza]] [[pizzeria]]; one [[barber|barber shop]]; one [[laundry]]  
employing local nationals; one dry cleaner; a tailor; various local vendors who sell Kosovo souvenirs and products; softball and football fields; and more.<ref name=globalsec/>

Camp Bondsteel is not open to inspections by the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] (CPT), which has the right to visit all "places of detention" of the member states of the [[Council of Europe]]. Negotiations with KFOR were underway, but they have been suspended since [[Kosovo's declaration of independence|Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence]] was not recognized by the Council of Europe. The United States Army had been criticized for using the base as a detention facility housing the detainees who were suspected of terrorism.<ref name=Javno2009-01-31>{{cite news

In November 2005, [[Alvaro Gil-Robles]], the human rights envoy of the Council of Europe, described the camp as a "smaller version of [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo]]" following a visit.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clandestine Camps in Europe: "Everyone Knew What Was Going On in Bondsteel"|date=5 December 2005|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|location=Hamburg|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/clandestine-camps-in-europe-everyone-knew-what-was-going-on-in-bondsteel-a-388556.html|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Secret prisons: Obama's order to close 'black sites'|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=23 January 2009|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Condi goes on offensive over secret CIA jails|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|location=London|date=4 December 2005|page=21}}</ref> The US Army denied the accusation and stated that there were no secret detention facilities in the Camp.<ref>{{cite news|title=US denies running secret prison in Kosovo as covert CIA flights investigated|date=28 November 2005|first=Daniel|last=McLaughlin|work=[[The Irish Times]]|location=Dublin|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/us-denies-running-secret-prison-in-kosovo-as-covert-cia-flights-investigated-1.522067|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>
