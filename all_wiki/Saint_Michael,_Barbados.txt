The [[parishes of Barbados|parish]] of '''St. Michael''' is one of eleven parishes of [[Barbados]]. It has a land area of 39&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and is found at the southwest portion of the island. Saint Michael has survived by name as one of the original six parishes created in 1629 by Governor Sir William Tufton.

The parish is home to [[Bridgetown]], the capital of [[Barbados]]. Bridgetown is the centre of commercial activity in Barbados, as well as a central hub for the public transport network. Other major infrastructure in St. Michael is the international seaport of Barbadosâ€”the [[Deep Water Harbour]]. Therein, a number of cruise ships arrive and depart including various lines such as [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] and [[Cunard Line|Cunard]]. The harbour features several sugar towers for loading locally produced sugar into transport ships, and a tower for loading flour for transport.
[[File:Bridgetown aerial.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Bridgetown]] The [[Needham's Point Lighthouse]] is located in Needham's Point, Saint Michael, behind the new Hilton Barbados Hotel.

Under Barbados's historical [[vestry]] system, the main [[Church of England parish church|parish church]] ([[Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels|St Michael's Cathedral]]) is sited in St Michael's Row in Bridgetown. The cathedral replaced the former parish church that was located at the site of St Mary's Church. St Michael's Cathedral was elevated to cathedral status under [[William Hart Coleridge|Bishop Coleridge]], who arrived in Barbados in 1825 to head the newly created Diocese of Barbados and the Leeward Islands.
