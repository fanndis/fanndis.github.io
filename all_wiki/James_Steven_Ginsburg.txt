'''James Steven Ginsburg''' (born September 8, 1965) is an American music producer. He is founder and president of [[Cedille Records]], a classical label he launched in 1989 while a student at the [[University of Chicago]].

==Background==
Ginsburg was born into a family of lawyers. His mother, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], was appointed to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] by President Bill Clinton in 1993. His father, [[Martin D. Ginsburg]], taught at [[Georgetown University Law Center]]. His sister, [[Jane C. Ginsburg|Jane]], teaches law at [[Columbia University]].

He attended [[The Dalton School]], [[Georgetown Day School]] in Washington, DC, and the [[University of Chicago]] where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1987, and attended its [[University of Chicago Law School|Law School]] for one and a half years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0610/peer/music.shtml|title=The University of Chicago Magazine|website=magazine.uchicago.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/19/style/weddings-lisa-brauston-james-ginsburg.html|title=WEDDINGS;Lisa Brauston, James Ginsburg|publisher= |work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 1995|accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref>

==Cedille Records==
Ginsburg was raised in [[New York City]]'s [[Upper East Side]], where he began collecting [[classical music]] recordings at an early age. While attending the [[University of Chicago]], he managed classical programming at the university’s mixed-format radio station, [[WHPK]]. Before his undergraduate graduation, he began reviewing classical recordings for ''[[American Record Guide]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideonline.com/site/epage/14066_162.htm|title=Local label is a Chicago classic North Side?s Cedille Records up for First Grammy Award|website=insideonline.com|accessdate=September 19, 2012|author=Silverman, Nathan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220104120/http://www.insideonline.com/site/epage/14066_162.htm|archivedate=February 20, 2012}}</ref>

In 1989, Ginsburg launched a record label, [[Cedille Records]], to record classical music produced by artists and composers in [[Chicago]]. The label is based in the Edgewater neighborhood of the city. Encouraged by the critical and commercial response to his early recordings, Ginsburg abandoned law school in his second year to devote himself full-time to Cedille.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.americantowns.com/il/chicago/news/chicago-tribune-names-james-ginsburg-a-chicagoan-of-the-year-243115|title=Chicago Tribune names Cedille President James Ginsburg a Chicagoan of the Year!|publisher=|website=americantowns.com|date=December 28, 2009|accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Rhein|first=John von|title=Classical recording label Cedille marks 25 years|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-0903-classical-cedille-20140903-column.html|access-date=September 18, 2020|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>

In 1994, Cedille became a not-for-profit under the umbrella of an operating foundation, now called Cedille Chicago, NFP (formerly The Chicago Classical Recording Foundation).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cedille Chicago, NFP|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/36-3925368|access-date=September 19, 2020|website=www.guidestar.org}}</ref> This change gave Cedille the ability to produce more recordings and pursue more ambitious projects. Cedille Records releases an average of eight recordings per year. 

==Professional recognition==
In 2009, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' nominated Ginsburg as "Chicagoan of the Year," writing, "Let's hear it for James Ginsburg. The Chicagoan is one of the last independent entrepreneurs in classical recording, a man who has stuck to his artistic vision and made a success of it at a time of market shrinkage and industry downsizing."<ref name="auto"/>

In 2010, Ginsburg won the Helen Coburn Meier and Tim Meier Charitable Foundation for the Arts Achievement Award. In making the award, the Foundation wrote, "We applaud Jim for seeing that Chicago has an abundance of stellar musicians. With his recording projects, Jim believes he can advance musicians' careers and serve the listening public in equal measure."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Helen Coburn Meier & Tim Meier Charitable Foundation for the Arts – James Ginsburg|url=http://www.meierfoundation.org/james-ginsburg/|access-date=September 18, 2020|language=en-US}}</ref>

Additional recognition and awards include being named a Jewish Chicagoan of the Year by the [[Chicago Jewish News]] in 2011; in 2012, he received the Ruth D. and Ken M. Davee Excellence in the Arts Award from the [[Illinois Philharmonic Orchestra]]; in 2016, [[Musical America]] named him one of The Top 30 Performing Arts Professionals of the Year;<ref>{{Cite web|title=MusicalAmerica - MA 30 The Innovators: James Ginsburg|url=https://www.musicalamerica.com/news/newsstory.cfm?storyid=37344&categoryid=7|access-date=September 18, 2020|website=www.musicalamerica.com}}</ref> and in 2017, he was the honoree at the annual galas of both [[Chicago Opera Theater]] and the Rembrandt Chamber Musicians. Most recently, he received a 2020 Distinguished Service to the Arts Award from Lawyers for the Creative Arts.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 4, 2020|title=Annual Benefit|url=https://law-arts.org/annual-benefit-0|access-date=September 18, 2020|website=Lawyers for the Creative Arts|language=en}}</ref>
