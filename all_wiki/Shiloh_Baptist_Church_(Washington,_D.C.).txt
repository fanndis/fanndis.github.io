'''Shiloh Baptist Church''' is located at 1500 9th Street N.W., [[Washington, D.C.]] 20001 in the historic [[Shaw, Washington, D.C.|Shaw District]].  The church was founded in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg, VA]] in 1804.

==History==
===Origins in Fredericksburg VA===
The Shiloh Baptist Church was organized by its white members in 1804. The church's membership included some free blacks but most were slaves. The black members were subjected to segregated seating. The church was sold to African American members in 1854, and this congregation was led by a white pastor.<ref name="From Strength to Strength">From Strength to Strength: A Journey of Faith 1863-1988, p. 25</ref>

===Civil War===
At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Shiloh had about 750 members. The Civil War disrupted the church's life but also brought the possibility of equality for blacks. The Shiloh religious services were discontinued when the Union Army wanted to use the church as a hospital because of a planned attack on Fredericksburg in June 1862.

The Union Army protected and helped the slaves and free blacks escape to Washington D.C. About 400 members of the Shiloh Baptist Church of Fredericksburg arrived in Washington D.C. Once in Washington D.C., they became free civilians in April 1862 when Congress emancipated the slaves of the District of Columbia.<ref name="From Strength to Strength"/>
