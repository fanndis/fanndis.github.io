A '''filibuster''' is a political procedure where one or more members of [[parliament]] or congress debate over a proposed piece of legislation so as to delay or entirely prevent a decision being made on the proposal. It is sometimes referred to as "talking a bill to death" or "talking out a bill"<ref>"Talking it out" usage example: {{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6654675.stm |title=MPs renew info exemption effort |date=15 May 2007 |publisher=BBC |access-date=25 September 2010}}</ref> and is characterized as a form of [[obstructionism|obstruction]] in a [[legislature]] or other decision-making body. This form of political obstruction reaches as far back as Ancient Roman times and could also be referred to synonymously with political [[stonewalling]]. Due to the often extreme length of time required for a successful filibuster, many speakers stray off topic after exhausting the original subject matter. Past speakers have read through laws from different states, recited speeches, and even read from cookbooks and phone books.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Jon |title=The art of the filibuster: How do you talk for 24 hours straight? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20672974 |website=BBC News Magazine |publisher=BBC |access-date=12 June 2018}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The word filibuster comes from the Spanish "filibote", English "[[fly-boat]]", a small, swift sailing-vessel with a large mainsail, which enabled [[buccaneer]]s to pursue merchantmen in the open sea and escape when pursued.<ref>{{citation | author=R. A. Van Middeldyk | title=The History of Puerto Rico | year=1910 | page=131 | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofpuertor00vanm}}</ref> The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' finds its only known use in early modern English in a 1587 book describing "flibutors" who robbed supply convoys.<ref name="OED">''Oxford English Dictionary'', "filibuster", pp. F:212–213.</ref>

The English ''filibuster'' was borrowed from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in the 19th century. Originally it applied to pirates infesting the Spanish American coasts, but around 1850 it designated the followers of [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and [[Narciso López]], who were then pillaging former Spanish colonies in [[Central America]].<ref name="webster">{{citation | entry=FILIBUSTER | title=[[Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]] | year=1913}}</ref> The word entered American political slang with the meaning "to delay legislation by [[dilatory motion]]s or other artifices".<ref name="webster" />

==Ancient Rome==
One of the first known practitioners of the filibuster was the [[Roman Senate|Roman senator]] [[Cato the Younger]]. Cato would obstruct a measure by speaking continuously until nightfall.<ref name="goldsworthy">{{Cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|title=Caesar: Life of a Colossus|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|year=2006|page=583}}</ref> As the Roman Senate had a rule requiring all business to conclude by dusk, Cato's long-winded speeches could forestall a vote.

Cato attempted to use the filibuster at least twice to frustrate the political objectives of [[Julius Caesar]].<ref name="goldsworthy"/> The first incident occurred during the summer of 60 BCE, when Caesar was returning home from his [[promagistrate|propraetorship]] in [[Hispania Ulterior]]. Caesar, by virtue of his military victories over the raiders and bandits in Hispania, had been awarded a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]  by the Senate. Having recently turned forty, Caesar had also become eligible to stand for [[Roman consul|consul]]. This posed a dilemma. Roman generals honored with a triumph were not allowed to enter the city prior to the ceremony, but candidates for the consulship were required, by law, to appear in person at the [[Forum Romanum|Forum]].<ref name="goldsworthy"/> The date of the election, which had already been set, made it impossible for Caesar to stand unless he crossed the ''[[pomerium]]'' and gave up the right to his triumph. Caesar petitioned the Senate to stand ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]],'' but Cato employed a filibuster to block the proposal. Faced with a choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship and entered the city.

Cato made use of the filibuster again in 59 BCE in response to a land reform bill sponsored by Caesar, who was then consul.<ref name="goldsworthy"/> When it was Cato's time to speak during the debate, he began one of his characteristically long-winded speeches. Caesar, who needed to pass the bill before his co-consul, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]], took possession of the ''[[fasces]]'' at the end of the month, immediately recognized Cato's intent and ordered the [[lictor]]s to jail him for the rest of the day. The move was unpopular with many senators and Caesar, realizing his mistake, soon ordered Cato's release. The day was wasted without the Senate ever getting to vote on a motion supporting the bill, but Caesar eventually circumvented Cato's opposition by taking the measure to the [[Tribal Assembly]], where it passed.

==Westminster-style parliaments==
{{See also |Westminster system}}
<!--Should probably transclude the introduction for Westminster system here-->

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], a bill defeated by a filibustering manoeuvre may be said to have been "talked out". The procedures of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] require that members cover only points germane to the topic under consideration or the debate underway whilst speaking. Example filibusters in the Commons and Lords include:
* In 1874, [[Joseph Biggar]] started making long speeches in the House of Commons to delay the passage of [[Irish coercion acts]]. [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], a young Irish nationalist [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP), who in 1880 became leader of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], joined him in this tactic to obstruct the business of the House and force the Liberals and Conservatives to negotiate with him and his party. The tactic was enormously successful, and Parnell and his MPs succeeded, for a time, in forcing Parliament to take the [[Irish Question]] of return to self-government seriously.
* In 1983, Labour MP [[John Golding (British politician)|John Golding]] talked for over 11 hours during an all-night sitting at the committee stage of the [[British Telecommunications]] Bill. However, as this was at a standing committee and not in the Commons chamber, he was also able to take breaks to eat.
* On July 3, 1998, Labour MP [[Michael Foster (Worcester MP)|Michael Foster]]'s Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill was blocked in parliament by opposition filibustering.
* In January 2000, filibustering directed by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs to oppose the [[Disqualifications Act 2000|Disqualifications Bill]] led to cancellation of the day's parliamentary business on [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]'s 1000th day in office. However, since this business included [[Prime Minister's Questions]], [[William Hague]], Conservative leader at that time, was deprived of the opportunity of a high-profile confrontation with the Prime Minister.
* On Friday 20 April 2007, a [[Private Member's Bill]] aimed at exempting Members of Parliament from the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] was "talked out" by a collection of MPs, led by Liberal Democrats [[Simon Hughes]] and Norman Baker who debated for five hours, therefore running out of time for the parliamentary day and "sending the bill to the bottom of the stack." However, since there were no other [[Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Private Members' Bills]]  to debate, it was resurrected the following Monday.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6586131.stm |title=MPs' info exemption bill revived |work=BBC News |date=2007-04-24 |access-date=2010-12-24}}</ref>
* In January 2011, Labour peers, including most notably [[John Prescott]], were attempting to delay the passage of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill 2010]] until after 16 February, the deadline given by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] to allow the referendum on the Alternative Vote to take place on 5 May. On the eighth day of debate, staff in the House of Lords set up camp beds and refreshments to allow peers to rest.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703396604576087740260334576?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Ainsley | last=Thomson | title=U.K. in Marathon Session on Voting Bill | date=2011-01-17}}</ref>
* In January 2012, Conservative and [[Scottish National Party]] MPs used filibustering to successfully block the Daylight Savings Bill 2010–12, a Private Member's Bill that would put the UK on [[Central European Time]]. The filibustering included an attempt by [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] to amend the bill to give the county of [[Somerset]] its own [[time zone]], 15 minutes behind London.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2012/01/conservative-backbenchers-halt-effort-to-move-the-clocks-forward.html | title=Conservative backbenchers halt effort to move clocks forward | date=January 21, 2012 | access-date=July 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n58wr9FVzO0 | title=Jacob Rees-Mogg Proposes Somerset Time Zone}}</ref>
* In November 2014, Conservative MPs [[Philip Davies]] and [[Christopher Chope]] successfully filibustered a Private Member's Bill that would prohibit retaliatory evictions. Davies's speech was curtailed by Deputy Speaker [[Dawn Primarolo]] for disregarding her authority, after she ordered Davies to wrap up his then hour-long speech. A closure motion moved by the government, which was agreed to 60–0, failed due to being inquorate.<ref>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/chan70.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/fury-as-retaliatory-evictions-bill-talked-out-of-commons/7007119.article|title=Fury as retaliatory evictions bill talked out of Commons|publisher=Inside Housing|access-date=15 June 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814222938/http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/fury-as-retaliatory-evictions-bill-talked-out-of-commons/7007119.article|archive-date=14 August 2016}}</ref>
* In October 2016 Conservative Minister [[Sam Gyimah]] filibustered a bill sponsored by [[John Nicolson (politician)|John Nicolson]] of the [[Scottish National Party]] that would pardon historic convictions of homosexual activity (which is no longer an offence), replacing an existing law that requires each pardon to be applied for separately.
* In October 2016, the Private Members' Bill of Labour's [[Julie Cooper (politician)|Julie Cooper MP]] which would exempt carers from having to pay hospital car parking charges, received its first reading on 24 June.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2015/june/private-members-ballot-bills-first-reading-24-june-2015/|title=Private Members' Ballot Bills First Reading: 24 June 2015 - News from Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref> At the second reading, in October, it was talked out in a fillibuster by the Conservative MP [[Philip Davies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-34691890/philip-davies-why-i-blocked-free-parking-bill|title=Tory MP: Why I blocked free parking bill|publisher=[[BBC News]]|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref>

The all-time Commons record for non-stop speaking, six hours, was set by [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] in 1828, though this was not a filibuster. The 21st century record was set on December 2, 2005 by [[Andrew Dismore]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP for [[Hendon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hendon]]. Dismore spoke for three hours and 17 minutes to block a Conservative Private Member's Bill, the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Protection of Property) Bill, which he claimed amounted to "vigilante law".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4492688.stm "MP's marathon speech sinks bill"]. [[BBC News]]. Retrieved February 14, 2007.</ref> Although Dismore is credited with speaking for 197 minutes, he regularly accepted interventions from other MPs who wished to comment on points made in his speech. Taking multiple interventions artificially inflates the duration of a speech and thus may be used as a tactic to prolong a speech.

In local [[unitary authorities of England]] a motion may be carried into closure by filibustering. This results in any additional motions receiving less time for debate by Councillors instead forcing a vote by the Council under closure rules.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

====Northern Ireland====
A notable filibuster took place in the [[Northern Ireland House of Commons]] in 1936 when [[Tommy Henderson]] (Independent Unionist MP for Shankill) spoke for nine and a half hours (ending just before 4 am) on the Appropriation Bill. As this Bill applied government spending to all departments, almost any topic was relevant to the debate, and Henderson used the opportunity to list all of his many criticisms of the Unionist government.

===Australia===
Both houses of the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] have strictly enforced rules on how long members may speak, so filibusters are generally not possible, though this is not the case in some state legislatures.<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/a00.htm Parliament of Australia] – Standing Orders and other orders of the Senate. Retrieved June 23, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216184132/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/a00.htm |date=February 16, 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/House/pubs/standos/chapter1.htm Parliament of Australia] – House of Representatives Standing and Sessional Orders.

The [[Museum of Australian Democracy]] identifies the last filibuster at the federal level to be a 12-hour-long speech (including interruptions) by Senator [[Albert Gardiner]] in 1918, in which he read the entire [[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]], to which the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] was opposed because it introduced preferential voting. The next year, [[Australian Senate|Senate]] speeches were limited to 20 minutes (there was already a limit on speeches in the House of Representatives).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rhodes |first1=Campbell |title=The last Australian filibuster |url=https://www.moadoph.gov.au/blog/the-last-australian-filibuster/# |website=Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House |access-date=9 June 2020}}</ref>

During the [[2008 Parnell–Bressington filibuster]], two Members of the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] spoke for 13 hours to filibuster "to stall changes to [[Workers' compensation|workers' compensation laws]].".<ref>{{cite news |title=SA MPs in record-breaking filibuster |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/sa-mps-in-recordbreaking-filibuster-20080509-2che.html |access-date=21 September 2020 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 May 2008 |language=en}}</ref>

In opposition, [[Tony Abbott]]'s [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal National coalition]] used [[Suspension of the rules|suspension]] of [[Parliamentary procedure|standing orders]] in 2012 for the purposes of talking at length on political issues, most commonly during question time against the Labor government.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ireland|first=Judith|title=Abbott finds a new victim for his schtick|url=https://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/blogs/question-time/abbott-finds-a-new-victim-for-his-schtick-20120229-1u2p7.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=February 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/suspended-in-the-time-it-takes-for-a-sound-bite/story-e6frgd0x-1226300897875 | work=The Australian | title=Suspended in the time it takes for a sound bite | date=2012-03-16}}</ref> However, the suspension of standing orders was not intended to delay or stop the passage of legislation, as with a traditional filibuster.

===New Zealand===
In August 2000, New Zealand opposition parties [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] delayed the voting for the Employment Relations Bill by voting slowly, and in some cases in [[Māori language|Māori]] (which required translation into English).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=147731 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315134007/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=147731 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-03-15 |title =Bill debate goes to rare Monday |first=Vernon |last=Small |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=2000-08-21 |access-date=2017-12-16}}</ref>

In 2009, several parties staged a filibuster of the Local Government (Auckland Reorganisation) Bill in opposition to the government setting up a new [[Auckland Council]] under urgency and without debate or review by select committee, by proposing thousands of [[wrecking amendments]] and voting in Māori as each amendment had to be voted on and votes in Māori translated into English. Amendments included renaming the council to "Auckland [[Katchafire]] Council" or "[[Rodney Hide]] Memorial Council" and replacing the phrase "powers of a regional council" with "power and muscle".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=157300 |title="Melissa Lee Memorial Council" mooted |publisher=Newstalk ZB |access-date=2010-12-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519190937/http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=157300 |archive-date=2009-05-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/2415569/Labour-filibuster-on-Supercity-bills |title=Labour filibuster on Supercity bills |work=Stuff.co.nz |access-date=2010-12-24}}</ref>

===India===
The [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of states) – which is the upper house in the bicameral [[Parliament of India]] – allows for a debate to be brought to a close with a simple majority decision of the house, on a closure motion so introduced by any member.<ref>{{cite book|last=Government of India|title=Handbook for Members of Rajya Sabha|date=January 2010|page=60 |chapter= 2: General Matters|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/handbook/hand_book_2010.pdf}}</ref> On the other hand, the [[Lok Sabha]] (Council of the people) – the lower house – leaves the closure of the debate to the discretion of the speaker, once a motion to end the debate is moved by a member.<ref>{{cite book|last=Government of India|title=Handbook for Members of Lok Sabha (Fifteenth Edition)|page=67|chapter=2: General|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/members/membersbook/Chapter2.pdf|access-date=2014-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813162644/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/members/membersbook/chapter2.pdf|archive-date=2014-08-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Ireland===
In 2014, Irish Justice Minister [[Alan Shatter]] performed a filibuster; he was perceived to "drone on and on" and hence this was termed a "Drone Attack".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/bizarre-story-defies-shatter-s-drone-attack-1.1697923 |title=Bizarre story defies Shatter’s drone attack | date=February 20, 2014 |work=The Irish Times}}</ref>

====Federal====
A dramatic example of filibustering in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] took place between Thursday June 23, 2011 and Saturday June 25, 2011. In an attempt to prevent the passing of Bill C-6, which would have legislated the imposing of a four-year contract and pay conditions on the locked out [[Canada Post]] workers, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) led a filibustering session which lasted for fifty-eight hours. The NDP argued that the legislation in its then form undermined collective bargaining. Specifically, the NDP opposed the salary provisions and the form of binding arbitration outlined in the bill.<ref name=cbc>

Another example of filibuster in Canada federally came in early 2014 when NDP MP and Deputy Leader [[David Christopherson]] filibustered the government's bill C-23, the [[Fair Elections Act]] at the Procedure and House Affairs Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=6427238&Language=E&Mode=1|title=House of Commons Committees – PROC (41-2) – Minutes of Proceedings – Number 016|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> His filibuster lasted several meetings the last of which he spoke for over 8 hours and was done to support his own motion to hold cross country hearings on the bill so MPs could hear what the Canadian public thought of the bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1190246/the-art-of-the-filibuster-preparation-focus-and-a-hardy-bladder/|title=The art of the filibuster: preparation, focus and a hardy bladder|first=Laura|last=Stone|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> In the end, given that the Conservative government had a majority at committee, his motion was defeated and the bill passed although with some significant amendments.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/05/13/conservatives_pass_fair_elections_act.html|title=Conservatives pass Fair Elections Act |work= Toronto Star|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref>

====Provincial====
The [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislature]] of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]] has witnessed several significant filibusters,<ref name="cpsa-acsp.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2006/Locke.pdf |title=Obstruction in the Ontario Legislature: The struggle for power between the government and the opposition |access-date=2012-08-07}}</ref> although two are notable for the unusual manner by which they were undertaken.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thoughtundermined.com/2011/01/26/on-filibusters/ |title=On Filibusters |access-date=2012-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803022656/http://thoughtundermined.com/2011/01/26/on-filibusters/ |archive-date=2012-08-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first was an effort on May 6, 1991, by [[Mike Harris]], later premier but then leader of the opposition [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservatives]], to derail the implementation of the budget tabled by the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|NDP]] government under premier [[Bob Rae]]. The tactic involved the introduction of Bill 95, the title of which contained the names of every lake, river and stream in the province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/hansardeissue/35-1/l028.htm |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Hansard. Monday, 6 May 1991 |access-date=2012-08-07}}</ref> Between the reading of the title by the proposing [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]], and the subsequent obligatory reading of the title by the clerk of the chamber, this filibuster occupied the entirety of the day's session until adjournment. To prevent this particular tactic from being used again, changes were eventually made to the [[Parliamentary procedure|Standing Orders]] to limit the time allocated each day to the introduction of bills to 30 minutes.<ref name="cpsa-acsp.ca"/>

A second high-profile and uniquely implemented filibuster in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario Legislature]] occurred in April 1997, where the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]], then in opposition, tried to prevent the governing [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservatives']] [[Common Sense Revolution#Bill 103|Bill 103]] from taking effect. To protest the Tory government's legislation that would [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamate]] the municipalities of [[Metro Toronto]] into the "megacity" of [[Toronto]], the small NDP caucus introduced 11,500 [[Bill (proposed law)|amendments]] to the megacity bill, created on computers with [[mail merge]] functionality. Each amendment would name a street in the proposed city, and provide that public hearings be held into the megacity with residents of the street invited to participate. The [[Ontario Liberal Party]] also joined the filibuster with a smaller series of amendments; a typical Liberal amendment would give a historical designation to a named street. The NDP then added another series of over 700 amendments, each proposing a different date for the bill to come into force.
The filibuster began on April 2 with the Abbeywood Trail amendment<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/house-documents/parliament-36/session-1/1997-04-02/hansard-1#P1041_186456 |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Hansard. Wednesday, 2 April 1997, volume B |language=en |publisher=ola.org |access-date=2020-06-10}}</ref> and occupied the legislature day and night, the members alternating in shifts. On April 4, exhausted and often sleepy government members inadvertently let one of the NDP amendments pass, and the handful of residents of Cafon Court in [[Etobicoke, Ontario|Etobicoke]] were granted the right to a public consultation on the bill, although the government subsequently nullified this with an amendment of its own.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/house-documents/parliament-36/session-1/1997-04-04/hansard-2 |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

A weird example of filibustering occurred when the governing [[Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador]] had "nothing else to do in the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]" and debated between only themselves about their own interim supply bill, after both the Conservative and New Democratic Parties indicated they intended to vote in favour of the bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetelegram.com/news/local/2017/3/14/liberal-government-filibusters-its-own-budget-debate.amp.html|title=Liberal government filibusters its own budget debate|last=McLeod|first=James|date=March 14, 2017|website=The Telegram|access-date=November 5, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315024711/http://www.thetelegram.com/news/local/2017/3/14/liberal-government-filibusters-its-own-budget-debate.amp.html|archive-date=March 15, 2017}}</ref>

On 28 October 1897, Dr. [[Otto Lecher]], Delegate for [[Brno|Brünn]], spoke continuously for twelve hours before the  ''Abgeordnetenhaus'' ("House of Delegates") of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|''Reichsrat'']] ("Imperial Council") of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], to block action on the "''[[Ausgleich]]''" with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], which was due for renewal.

In the [[Southern Rhodesia]] Legislative Assembly, Independent member Dr [[Ahrn Palley]] staged a similar filibuster against the Law and Order Maintenance Bill on 22 November 1960, although this took the form of moving a long series of amendments to the Bill, and therefore consisted of multiple individual speeches interspersed with comments from other Members. Palley kept the Assembly sitting from 8 PM to 12:30 PM the following day.

In the [[Senate of the Philippines]], [[Roseller Lim]] of the [[Nacionalista Party]] held out the longest filibuster in [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]] history.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} On the election for the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines]] in April 1963, he stood on the podium for more than 18 hours to wait for party-mate [[Alejandro Almendras]] who was to arrive from the United States. The Nacionalistas, who comprised exactly half of the Senate, wanted to prevent the election of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to the Senate Presidency. Prohibited from even going to the comfort room, he had to relieve himself in his pants until Almendras' arrival. He voted for party-mate [[Eulogio Rodriguez]] just as Almendras arrived, and had to be carried off via stretcher out of the session hall due to exhaustion. However, Almendras voted for Marcos, and the latter wrested the Senate Presidency from the Nacionalistas after more than a decade of control.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

On December 16, 2010, [[Werner Kogler]] of the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Austrian Green Party]] gave his speech before the budget committee, criticizing the failings of the budget and the governing parties ([[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Austrian People's Party]]) in the last years.

===Senate===
{{Main|Filibuster in the United States Senate}}
The filibuster is a powerful legislative device in the [[United States Senate]].

[[File:Senator Murphy gun control filibuster.webm|thumb|US Senator [[Chris Murphy]] engaging in a filibuster (commencing at 1hr 52mins)]]

Under current Senate rules, any modification or limitation of the filibuster would be a rule change that itself could be filibustered, with two-thirds of those senators present and voting (as opposed to the normal three-fifths of those sworn) needing to vote to break the filibuster.<ref name=rule22/>

However, under Senate precedents, a simple majority can (and has acted to) limit the practice by overruling decisions of the chair. The removal or substantial limitation of the filibuster by a simple majority, rather than a rule change, is colloquially called the [[nuclear option]].

On November 21, 2013, the then-Democratic-controlled Senate exercised the [[nuclear option]], in a 52–48 vote, to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of all executive and judicial nominees, excluding Supreme Court nominees, rather than the 3/5 of votes previously required.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/us/politics/reid-sets-in-motion-steps-to-limit-use-of-filibuster.html?hpw&rref=us&_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Jeremy W. | last=Peters | title=In Landmark Vote, Senate Limits Use of the Filibuster | date=2013-11-21}}</ref> On April 6, 2017, the Republican-controlled Senate did the same, in a 52–48 vote, to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] nominees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-approves-nuclear-option-fight-gorsuch-supreme-court/story?id=46608672|title=Senate OKs ‘nuclear option,' clears path for high court nomination vote|date=2017-04-06|website=ABC News|access-date=2017-04-06}}</ref>  A 60% supermajority is still required to end filibusters on legislation.

=== House of Representatives ===
In the [[United States House of Representatives]], the filibuster (the right to unlimited debate) was used until 1842, when a permanent rule limiting the duration of debate was created. The [[disappearing quorum]] was a tactic used by the minority until [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Thomas Brackett Reed]] eliminated it in 1890. As the membership of the House grew much larger than the [[United States Senate|Senate]], the House had acted earlier to control floor debate and the delay and blocking of floor votes. On February 7, 2018, Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] set a record for the longest speech on the House floor (8 hours and 7 minutes), in support of [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]], taking advantage of the fact that the [[Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives|Minority Leader]] is allowed to speak indefinitely without interruption.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-surpasses-hour-immigration-speech-house-floor/story?id=52904794|title=Pelosi ends immigration speech after more than 8 hours, setting record|date=8 February 2018|website=ABC News|access-date=10 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nancy-pelosi-holds-fake-filibuster-on-house-floor-on-dreamers/|title=Nancy Pelosi sets record for longest House floor speech about Dreamers|website=cbsnews.com|access-date=10 March 2018}}</ref>

==France==
In France, member of Parlement [[Christine Boutin]] spoke for five hours in the [[National Assembly (France)|French National Assembly]] in November 1999 in an attempt to prevent or postpone the adoption of [[Civil solidarity pact|PACS]], a contractual form of civil union open to homosexual couples, which she opposed.

In August 2006, the left-wing opposition submitted 137,449 amendments<ref>{{Cite news|title=TIMELINE: Key dates in Gaz de France-Suez merger |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL0257250120070902 |agency=Reuters |date=2 September 2007 |access-date=2010-02-24}}</ref> to the proposed law bringing the share in [[Gaz de France]] owned by the French state from 80% to 34% in order to allow for the merger between Gaz de France and [[Suez (company)|Suez]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/19/business/worldbusiness/19iht-gdf.2868154.html |title=Plan for Gaz de France advances toward a vote |last=Kanter |first=James |date=19 September 2006 |work=International Herald Tribune |access-date=2010-02-24}}</ref> Normal parliamentary procedure would require 10 years to vote on all the amendments.

The [[Constitution of France|French constitution]] gives the government two options to defeat such a filibuster. The first one was originally the use of the [[Article 49 of the French Constitution|article 49]] paragraph 3 procedure, according to which the law was adopted except if a majority is reached on a non-confidence motion (a reform of July 2008 resulted in this power being restricted to budgetary measures only, plus one time each ordinary session – i.e. from October to June – on any bill. Before this reform, article 49, 3 was frequently used, especially when the government was short a majority in the [[Assemblée nationale]] to support the text but still enough to avoid a non-confidence vote). The second one is the article 44 paragraph 3 through which the government can force a global vote on all amendments it did not approve or submit itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fr00000_.html |title=France – Constitution |publisher=International Constitutional Law |access-date=2010-02-24}}</ref>

In the end, the government did not have to use either of those procedures. As the parliamentary debate started, the left-wing opposition chose to withdraw all the amendments to allow for the vote to proceed. The "filibuster" was aborted because the privatisation of Gaz de France appeared to have little opposition amongst the general population. It also appeared that this privatisation law could be used by the left-wing in the presidential election of 2007 as a political argument. Indeed, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], president of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]] (UMP – the right wing party), Interior Minister, former Finance Minister and campaigning for [[President of France|President]], had previously promised that the share owned by the French government in Gaz de France would never go below 70%.

==Hong Kong==
The first incidence of filibuster in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) after [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|the Handover]] occurred during the second reading of the Provision of Municipal Services (Reorganization) Bill in 1999, which aimed at dissolving the partially elected [[Urban Council, Hong Kong|Urban Council]] and [[Regional Council (Hong Kong)|Regional Council]]. As the absence of some [[Pro-Beijing camp|pro-Establishment]] legislators would mean an inadequate support for the passing of the bill, the Pro-establishment Camp filibustered along with [[Michael Suen]], the then-[[Secretary for Constitutional Affairs]], the voting of the bill was delayed to the next day and that the absentees could cast their votes. Though the filibuster was criticised by the [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy camp]], [[Lau Kong-wah]] of the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong]] (DAB) defended their actions, saying "it (a filibuster) is totally acceptable in a parliamentary assembly."<ref>[http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr99-00/english/counmtg/hansard/991201fe.pdf Official Record of Proceedings, Legislative Council, 1 December 1999], p. 1875.</ref>

Legislators of the Pro-democracy Camp filibustered during a debate about financing the construction of the [[Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link]] by raising many questions on very minor issues, delaying the passing of the bill from 18 December 2009 to 16 January 2010.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126315844550823775 Hong Kong Opposition to Rail Holds Off Vote], Wall Street Journal</ref> The [[Legislative Council Building (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council Building]] was surrounded by thousands of [[Guangzhou-Hong Kong high-speed rail controversy|anti-high-speed rail protesters]] during the course of the meetings.

In 2012, [[Albert Chan]] and [[Wong Yuk-man]] of [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] submitted a total of 1306 amendments to the Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill, by which the government attempted to forbid lawmakers from participating in by-elections after their resignation. The bill was a response to the so-called '[[2010 Hong Kong by-election|Five Constituencies Referendum]], in which 5 lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp resigned and then joined the by-election, claiming that it would affirm the public's support to push forward the electoral reform. The pro-democracy camp strongly opposed the bill{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}, saying it was seen a deprivation of the citizens' political rights. As a result of the filibuster, the LegCo carried on multiple overnight debates on the amendments. In the morning of 17 May 2012, the President of the LegCo ([[Jasper Tsang]]) terminated the debate, citing Article 92 of the Rules of Procedure of LegCo: ''In any matter not provided for in these Rules of Procedure, the practice and procedure to be followed in the Council shall be such as may be decided by the President who may, if he thinks fit, be guided by the practice and procedure of other legislatures.'' In the end, all motions to amend the bill were defeated and the Bill was passed.

To ban filibuster, [[Ip Kwok-him]] of the DAB sought to limit each member to move only one motion, by amending the procedures of the Finance Committee and its two subcommittees in 2013. All 27 members from pan-democracy camp submitted 1.9 million amendments.<ref>[http://legco.gov.hk/yr12-13/english/fc/fc/papers/fc0222fc-104-1-e.pdf Paper for the Finance Committee Meeting on 22 February 2013: Members' motions that seek to amend the procedures of the Finance Committee and its two subcommittees], Legislative Council of Hong Kong</ref> The Secretariat estimated that 408 man-months (each containing 156 working hours) were needed to vet the facts and accuracy of the motions, and, if all amendments were admitted by the Chairman, the voting time would take 23,868 two-hour meetings.

{{as of|2017}}, filibustering is still an ongoing practice in Hong Kong by the pan-democratic party, but at the same time, the pan-democratic party are undergoing huge amounts of fire from the pro-Beijing camp for making filibustering a norm in the Legislative Council.

==Iran==
In [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company#Nationalisation|Iranian oil nationalisation]], the filibustering speech of [[Hossain Makki]], the [[Iranian National Front|National Front]] deputy took four days<ref name="Encyclopædia Iranica 1901">{{cite web | title=Oil Agreements in Iran | website=Encyclopædia Iranica | date=1901-05-28 | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/oil-agreements-in-iran | access-date=2015-09-01}}</ref> that made the pro-British and pro-royalists in [[Majlis (Iran)]] inactive.
