''The Week'' was founded in the United Kingdom by [[Jolyon Connell]] (formerly of the right-of-centre ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'') in 1995.<ref name=pasm>{{cite web|title=The 20 Best Magazines of the Decade (2000-2009)|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2009/11/the-20-best-magazines-of-the-decade.html|work=Paste Magazine|accessdate=10 August 2015|date=26 November 2009}}</ref> In April 2001, the magazine began publishing an American edition;<ref name=pasm/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Steve Black|title=Life spans of Library Journal's 'Best Magazines of the Year'|journal=Serials Review|date=2009|volume=35|issue=4|pages=213â€“217|doi=10.1080/00987913.2009.10765248}}</ref> and an Australian edition followed in October 2008. [[Dennis Publishing]], founded by [[Felix Dennis]], publishes the UK edition and, until 2012, published the Australian edition. The Week Publications publishes the U.S. edition.

The various editions of the magazine provide perspectives on the week's current events and other news, as well as editorial commentary from global media, with the intent to provide readers with multiple political viewpoints.
