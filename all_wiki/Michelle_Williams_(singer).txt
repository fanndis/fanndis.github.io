== Life and career ==
=== 1979-99: Early life ===
Williams was born in [[Rockford, Illinois]], on July 23, 1979<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B0ZBYXvgicJ/|title=Michelle Williams on Instagram: "My birthday celebration was a perfect evening of friends and family.

Williams graduated from [[Rockford Auburn High School]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Beyonce Knowles|author2=Kelendria Rowland|author3=Michelle Williams|title=Soul Survivors: The Official Autobiography of Destiny's Child|year=2002|publisher=HarperCollins|pages=42–43}}</ref> Shortly after graduating, she pursued a degree in [[criminal justice]] at [[Illinois State University]], doubtful of her ability to make a career as a professional singer. However, after two years of college, she left to pursue a music career, as a backing vocalist for other artists such as [[Monica Arnold|Monica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rrstar.com/article/20140720/Special/140719488|title=Michelle Williams: Back to her gospel roots, with Destiny's Child mates in tow|author=Corina Curry|website=Rockford Register Star}}</ref> In late 1999, 20-year-old Williams met Destiny's Child band members [[Beyoncé Knowles]] and [[Kelly Rowland]] in the lobby of an [[Atlanta]] hotel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9oDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA194|title=Ebony|page=194|date=September 5, 2000|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|via=Google Books}}</ref> Several months later, a choreographer acquaintance of Williams who knew the group connected Williams to the Knowles family and Rowland, as they were vetting potential new group members.<ref name="DunnDate">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/jun/10/life1.lifemagazine5|title=Date with destiny|last=Dunn|first=Jancee|date=June 10, 2001|work=The Observer|accessdate=February 27, 2009|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023132651/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/jun/10/life1.lifemagazine5|archive-date=October 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 2000–03: Breakthrough with Destiny's Child, ''Heart to Yours'' and ''Aida'' ===
{{main|Destiny's Child|Heart to Yours}}
After the much-publicized turmoil, Williams, alongside backup dancer [[Farrah Franklin]]—officially joined the group in early 2000, replacing [[LeToya Luckett]] and [[LaTavia Roberson]] without notice. Buoyed by the group's breakout success, Luckett and Roberson had both attempted to split with the group's manager in the late 1990s, claiming that he kept a disproportionate share of the band's profits and unfairly favored Knowles and Rowland.<ref name="Kaufman">{{Cite news |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |title=Destiny's Child's Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing) |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504044/20050613/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=June 13, 2005 |accessdate=April 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624084104/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504044/destinys-childs-long-road-fame.jhtml |archive-date=June 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The issue was heightened after Williams and Franklin appeared in the video of "[[Say My Name]]", implying that the original band members were already replaced.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Franklin, however, faded from the group after five months, as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. Franklin attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group resulting from the strife.<ref name="Kaufman"/> After settling on this final lineup, the trio recorded "[[Independent Women Part I]]", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]''. It became their best-charting single yet, topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|official US singles chart]] for eleven consecutive weeks;<ref name="Kaufman"/> the success cemented the new lineup and skyrocketed them to fame.

In May 2001, Destiny's Child released the group's third studio album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]''.

== Personal life ==
Williams reportedly began dating pastor and professional sports chaplain Chad Johnson in July 2017. Williams and Johnson announced their engagement via ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' on April 19, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://people.com/music/michelle-williams-destinys-child-engaged-pastor-chad-johnson/|title=Michelle Williams Is Engaged!

On November 3, 2018, the reality show ''Chad Loves Michelle'' began airing on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.essence.com/entertainment/michelle-williams-reality-series-chad-loves-michelle/|title=Michelle Williams And Fiancé Chad Johnson To Star In New Reality Series 'Chad Loves Michelle'|website=Essence|access-date=November 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106132322/https://www.essence.com/entertainment/michelle-williams-reality-series-chad-loves-michelle/|archive-date=November 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2018, Williams announced that she and Johnson had both called off their engagement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/994282/destiny-s-child-s-michelle-williams-says-she-and-pastor-chad-johnson-split/|title=Destiny's Child's Michelle Williams and Pastor Chad Johnson Break Up|last=Heller|first=Corinne|work=[[E!]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181208161544/https://www.eonline.com/news/994282/destiny-s-child-s-michelle-williams-says-she-and-pastor-chad-johnson-split|archive-date=December 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Williams has a history of depression, saying that she has "been suffering since the ages of 13 and 15".<ref name="BBC1">{{cite news |title=Michelle Williams was suicidal in Destiny's Child |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41678187 |accessdate=25 September 2020 |publisher=BBC |date=19 October 2017}}</ref> During her time with Destiny's Child, she says that she told their then-manager [[Mathew Knowles]] about her feelings, but that he  did not really understand. He replied to her concerns by trying to point out the good side of their new-found fame, "You all just signed a multi-millionaire dollar deal, you're about to go on tour, what have you got to be depressed about?"<ref name=BBC1 /> She said that she had difficulty understanding her own feelings until later in life, around her thirties, stating that "I didn't know until I was in my 30s what was going on, I just thought it was growing pains, I just thought I'm turning into a woman." She also felt that Knowles intended no malice, and only had her best interests at heart, "Bless his heart... I think he wanted me to be grateful, which I was, but I was still sad."<ref name=BBC1 />

Williams again felt helpless after she and her fiancé, Chad Johnson, split up in late 2018. She said the breakup left her "shattered and [...] fighting suicidal thoughts."<ref name="MCD1">{{cite news |last1=DeSantis |first1=Rachel |title=Michelle Williams Talks Battling Through Her Depression: 'I Didn't Think I Would Be Alive' Today |url=https://people.com/music/michelle-williams-depression-didnt-think-i-would-be-alive/ |accessdate=25 September 2020 |work=People |publisher=Meredith Corporation |date=2019-06-27}}</ref> She said that she felt "so angry. The rage built up in me. I did not attempt suicide, but I was questioning [life]".<ref name="MCD1" /> Williams suffered a nervous breakdown just after opening day for a Broadway production of ''Once on This Island'', and was advised to leave the show by her doctor. By April 2020 she had returned to better health, saying that "I am in a better place now. I am not perfect. I'm not preaching [...] When people say it gets better, it does. It just takes time. The days do get brighter".<ref name="MCD1" />

In November 2020, Williams announced plans to release a memoir "revealing her entire truth including a deeper dive into where her anxiety and depression came from." She stated, "I'm ready to share, I’ve been a very transparent person and now I'm ready to share the good, bad, and ugly parts of my journey—the concerning part of my journey. [...] I really go into the specifics, I really go into the first time I was diagnosed, I go into assessing the first time I had anxiety in a romantic relationship and what it did to that relationship and then subsequently what it did to the next one." Williams said she hoped to "really help heal through my story" and "let people know what I do on a daily, what I do on a monthly–whatever it takes to get people whole and get people where they can maybe start seeing some better results in their own life." The book titled ''Checking In: How Getting Real about Depression Saved My Life—and Can Save Yours'' will be published in May 2021.<ref name="essence.com"/>

In 2001, Williams made a "bountiful" donation of $148,900 to her church, St. Paul Church of God in Christ in Rockford, Illinois – of which she has been a member since birth – to finish construction of the church's school, St. Paul Academy.
