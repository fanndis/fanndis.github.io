==Early life==
Olson was born Barbara Kay Bracher in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], on December 27, 1955. Her older sister, Toni Bracher-Lawrence, was a member of the Houston City Council from 2004 to 2010. She graduated from [[Waltrip High School]]<ref>"[http://hs.houstonisd.org/WaltripHS/TriviaFolder/trivia.htm Waltrip Trivia Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831194046/http://hs.houstonisd.org/WaltripHS/TriviaFolder/trivia.htm |date=2012-08-31 }}," ''[[Waltrip High School]]''</ref> and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of St. Thomas (Houston)|University of Saint Thomas]] in Houston. She earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[Yeshiva University]] [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]].{{fact|date=November 2020}}

==Career==
As a newcomer, she achieved a surprising measure of success, working for [[HBO]] and Stacy Keach Productions.{{When|date=May 2012}} In the early 1990s, she worked as an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of [[Wilmer Cutler & Pickering]] where she did civil litigation for several years before becoming an [[Assistant U.S. Attorney]].{{fact|date=November 2020}}

Olson's support in 1991 of Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas]] led to the formation of the [[Independent Women's Forum]]. At that time, Olson and friend [[Rosalie (Ricky) Gaull Silberman]] started an informal network of women who supported the Thomas nomination to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment by [[Anita Hill]], a former subordinate of Thomas at the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]. Olson, who had also worked under Thomas at the EEOC and was a close friend of Thomas, spoke out on his behalf during his contentious Senate confirmation hearings. Olson later helped edit ''[[The Real Anita Hill]]'', a book by [[David Brock]] that savaged Hill and portrayed the harassment claim as a political dirty trick (Brock later recanted his claims and apologized to Hill). The Independent Women's Forum continued on with a goal of retaining a high profile group of women to advocate for economic and political freedom and personal responsibility.{{fact|date=November 2020}}

In 1994, Olson became chief investigative counsel for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]. In that position, she led the [[Travelgate]] and [[Filegate]] investigations into the Clinton administration. She was later a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of the [[Birmingham, Alabama]] law firm [[Balch & Bingham]].{{fact|date=November 2020}}

==Personal life==
She married [[Theodore Olson]] in 1996, becoming his third wife.<ref name=napanuptials>{{cite news |title= Napa Nuptials for Olson and His Lady |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/22/AR2006102200052.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns |date= October 22, 2006 |accessdate= August 19, 2009 |work= [[The Washington Post]] |first1= Amy |last1= Argetsinger |first2= Roxanne |last2= Roberts |name-list-style= amp |authorlink1= Amy Argetsinger |authorlink2= Roxanne Roberts |department= The Reliable Source }}</ref> Theodore went on to successfully represent [[2000 United States presidential election|presidential candidate]] [[George W. Bush]] in the Supreme Court case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', and subsequently served as [[United States Solicitor General|U.S. Solicitor General]] in the Bush administration.{{fact|date=November 2020}}

Olson was a frequent critic of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton administration]] and wrote a book about then [[First Lady]] [[Hillary Clinton]], ''Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton'' (1999). Olson's  second book, ''The Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House'' was published posthumously.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_final_days.html?id=xANcUb7FY1UC | title=The final days: the last, desperate abuses of power by the Clinton White House | publisher=Regnery Pub. | author=Olson, Barbara | date=October 25, 2001| isbn=9780895261670 }}</ref>
