'''Le Havre''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|_|ˈ|h|ɑː|v|(|r|ə|)}},<ref>{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|Le Havre|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Le Havre|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Le Havre|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref> {{IPA-fr|lə ɑvʁ(ə)|lang|LL-Q150 (fra)-Jules78120-Le Havre.wav}}; {{lang-nrf|Lé Hâvre}}) is an urban French [[Communes of France|commune]] and city in the [[Seine-Maritime]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Normandy (French region)|Normandy]] region of northwestern France. It is situated on the right bank of the [[estuary]] of the [[Seine|river Seine]] on the [[English Channel|Channel]] southwest of the [[Pays de Caux]]. Le Havre is the most populous commune of Upper Normandy, although the total population of the greater Le Havre conurbation is smaller than that of [[Rouen]]. After [[Reims]], it is also the second largest [[subprefecture]] in France. The name ''Le Havre'' means "the harbour" or "the port". Its inhabitants are known as ''Havrais'' or ''Havraises''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.habitants.fr/seine-maritime-76|title=Le nom des habitants du 76 - Seine-Maritime - Habitants|website=www.habitants.fr}}</ref>

The city and port were founded by [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] in 1517. Economic development in the [[Early modern period]] was hampered by [[European wars of religion|religious wars]], conflicts with the English, epidemics, and storms. It was from the end of the 18th century that Le Havre started growing and the port took off first with the slave trade then other international trade. After the 1944 bombings the firm of [[Auguste Perret]] began to rebuild the city in concrete. The oil, chemical, and automotive industries were dynamic during the [[Trente Glorieuses]] (postwar boom) but the 1970s marked the end of the golden age of [[ocean liner]]s and the beginning of the economic crisis: the population declined, unemployment increased and remains at a high level today.

Changes in years 1990–2000 were numerous. The right won the municipal elections and committed the city to the path of reconversion, seeking to develop the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] and new industries ([[Aeronautics]], [[Wind turbine]]s). The [[Port of Le Havre|Port 2000]] project increased the container capacity to compete with ports of northern Europe, transformed the southern districts of the city, and ocean liners returned. Modern Le Havre remains deeply influenced by its employment and maritime traditions. Its [[Port of Le Havre|port]] is the second largest in France, after that of [[Marseille-Fos Port|Marseille]], for total traffic, and the largest French [[Intermodal container|container]] port.

In 2005, [[UNESCO]] inscribed the central city of Le Havre as a [[World Heritage Site]]. The [[Musée Malraux|André Malraux Modern Art Museum]] is the second of France for the number of [[Impressionism|impressionist paintings]]. The city has been awarded two flowers by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.villes-et-villages-fleuris.com/les_villes_et_village_fleuris-47.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210053901/http://www.cnvvf.fr/les_villes_et_village_fleuris-47.html|url-status=dead|title=Site officiel du Label Villes et Villages Fleuris|archivedate=10 December 2014|website=www.villes-et-villages-fleuris.com}}</ref>

===Location===
{{further|Le Havre Seine Métropole|Baie de la Seine}}

Le Havre is located {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Rouen]] on the shore of the [[English Channel]] and at the mouth of the [[Seine]]. Numerous roads link to Le Havre with the main access roads being the [[A29 autoroute]] from [[Amiens]] and the [[A13 autoroute]] from Paris linking to the [[A131 autoroute]].

[[File:Map Le Havre.jpg|thumb|Map of Le Havre: to the south the Seine estuary; to the west the [[English Channel]].]]

Administratively, Le Havre is a commune in the [[Normandy]] region in the west of the department of [[Seine-Maritime]]. The urban area of Le Havre corresponds roughly to the territory of the [[Agglomeration community of Le Havre]] (CODAH)<ref>[http://www.adcf.org/urbanisme/Redecoupage-des-unites-urbaines-poursuite-de-l-expansion-urbaine-760.html ''Rezoning of Urban areas: seeking urban expansion''], Assemblée des Communautés de France, consulted on 19 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> which includes 17 communes and 250,000 people.<ref>[http://www.agglo-lehavre.fr/delia-CMS/page/all-1/article_id-/article_principal_id-/folder_id-/topic_id-3/presentation.html ''Editorial'']{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, CODAH, consulted on 19 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> It occupies the south-western tip of the natural region of [[Pays de Caux]] where it is the largest city. Le Havre is sandwiched between the coast of the [[English Channel|Channel]] from south-west to north-west and the estuary of the Seine to the south.

===Geology and terrain===
{{details|Pays de Caux}}

Le Havre belongs to the [[Paris Basin]] which was formed in the [[Mesozoic]] period. The Paris Basin consists of [[sedimentary rocks]]. The commune of Le Havre consists of two areas separated by a natural cliff edge: one part in the lower part of the town to the south including the harbour, the city centre and the suburbs. It was built on former [[marshland]] and [[mudflat]]s that were drained in the 16th century.<ref name="Steiner21">Claire Étienne-Steiner, Frédéric Saunier, ''Le Havre a port with new towns'', Paris, éditions du patrimoine, 2005, p. 21 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The soil consists of several metres of [[alluvium]] or silt deposited by the [[Seine]].<ref name="Steiner21"/> The city centre was rebuilt after the Second World War using a metre of flattened rubble as a foundation.<ref>C. Étienne-Steiner, ''Le Havre. City, Port, and agglomeration'', Rouen, édition du patrimoine, 1999, p. 15 {{in lang|fr}}</ref><ref name="Letélié14">Isabelle Letélié, ''Le Havre, unusual itineraries'', Louviers, Ysec éditions, 2010, p. 14 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

The upper town to the north, is part of the [[Pays de Caux|cauchois]] [[plateau]]: the neighbourhood of Dollemard is its highest point (between {{convert|90|to|115|m|0|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]). The plateau is covered with a layer of [[flint]]y [[clay]] and a fertile [[silt]].<ref name="Ragot6">J. Ragot, M. Ragot, ''Guide to Nature in the Pays de Caux'', 2005, p. 6 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The bedrock consists of a large thickness of [[chalk]] measuring up to {{convert|200|m|0|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name="Auger33">P. Auger, G. Granier, ''The Guide to Pays de Caux'', 1993, p. 33 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Because of the slope the coast is affected by the risk of landslides.<ref name="carmen2">[http://carmen.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/17/DonneesrisquessurlestuairedelaSeine.map# ''Information on Nature and scenery in the estuary of the Seine''], Carmen, Haute-Normandie, consulted on 19 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Diagramme Climatique du Havre.png|thumb|[[Climograph|Climatic Graph]] for Le Havre]]

Due to its location on the coast of the Channel, the climate of Le Havre is [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]]. Days without wind are rare. There are maritime influences throughout the year. According to the records of the meteorological station of the [[Sainte-Adresse|Cap de la Heve]] (from 1961 to 1990), the temperature drops below {{convert|0|C|F}} on 24.9 days per year and it rises above {{convert|25|°C|0}} on 11.3 days per year. The average annual sunshine duration is 1,785.8 hours per year.<ref name=Infoclimat/>

Precipitation is distributed throughout the year, with a maximum in autumn and winter. The months of June and July are marked by some thunderstorms on average 2 days per month.<ref name=Infoclimat/> One of the characteristics of the region is the high variability of the temperature, even during the day.<ref name="Auger42">P. Auger, G. Granier, ''The Guide to Pays de Caux'', 1993, p. 42 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The prevailing winds are from the southwest sector for strong winds and north-north-east for breezes,<ref>[http://seine-aval.crihan.fr/web/SilverpeasWebFileServer/3993656065Ifr_Seine_aval_02.pdf?ComponentId=kmelia106&SourceFile=1161364849854.pdf&MimeType=application/pdf&Directory=Attachment/Images/&logicalName=3993656065Ifr_Seine_aval_02.pdf ''Currents, flows, and tides: The movements of water''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718041937/http://seine-aval.crihan.fr/web/SilverpeasWebFileServer/3993656065Ifr_Seine_aval_02.pdf?ComponentId=kmelia106&SourceFile=1161364849854.pdf&MimeType=application%2Fpdf&Directory=Attachment%2FImages%2F&logicalName=3993656065Ifr_Seine_aval_02.pdf |date=18 July 2013 }}, Pierre Le Hir, Ricardo Silva Jacinto, Ifremer, 2001, consulted on 31 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> snowstorms occur in winter, especially in January and February.<ref name=Infoclimat/>

[[File:Photojanvier2005CLG 002.jpg|thumb|Le Havre under snow]]

The absolute speed record for wind at Le Havre – Cap de la Heve was recorded on 16 October 1987 at {{convert|180|km/h|0|abbr=off}}.<ref name=Infoclimat/>

The main natural hazards are floods, storms, and [[storm surge]]s. The lower town is subject to a rising [[water table]].<ref name="carmen1">[http://carmen.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/17/DonneesnatureetpaysagesurlestuairedelaSeine.map ''Nature and Scenic information the estuary of the Seine''], Carmen, Haute-Normandie, consulted on 19 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The lack of watercourses within the commune prevents flooding from overflows. Le Havre's beach may rarely experience flooding known as "flooding from storms". These are caused by the combination of strong winds, high waves, and a large [[tidal range]].

For a long time Le Havre has exploited the strengths of its coastal location but also suffered from its relative isolation. This is why the accessibility of the city has been improved with the harbour highway A131 (E05) which links Le Havre to the [[A13 autoroute]] over [[Tancarville Bridge]]. The city is one hour from [[Rouen]] and one and a half-hour from [[Île-de-France]].<ref name="réseaux">[http://www.havre-developpement.com/havre_reseauxcommunication.asp Communication Network] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807001418/http://www.havre-developpement.com/havre_reseauxcommunication.asp |date=7 August 2013 }}, Le Havre Development, consulted on 20 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> More recently the [[A29 autoroute]] (E44) has connected Le Havre to the north of France and passes over the [[Pont de Normandie|Normandy Bridge]] which makes [[Amiens]] (in the north-east) two hours away and [[Caen]] (in the south-west) one hour.

The [[Transport express régional|TER]] network was modernized with the creation of the [[Lézarde Express Régionale|LER]] line in 2001 and direct services to [[Fécamp]] in 2005. Thirteen [[Corail (train)|Corail trains]] of the [[Paris–Le Havre railway|Paris–Le Havre line]] link stations at Bréauté-Beuzeville, [[Yvetot]], and [[Gare de Rouen-Rive-Droite|Rouen]], with [[Gare de Paris-Saint-Lazare|Paris Saint-Lazare station]].<ref name="réseaux"/> In addition there is a [[TGV]] daily service to Le Havre: it has connected the city to [[Marseille]] since December 2004 serving Rouen, [[Gare de Mantes-la-Jolie|Mantes-la-Jolie]], [[Gare de Versailles-Chantiers|Versailles]], [[Gare de Massy-Palaiseau|Massy]], [[Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu|Lyon]], [[Gare d'Avignon TGV|Avignon]], [[Aix-en-Provence TGV railway station|Aix-en-Provence]], and [[Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles|Saint Charles station]] in Marseilles.<ref name="réseaux"/>

No direct rail link connects Le Havre and [[Caen]] yet many projects – known as the "Southwest Line" – to link Le Havre to the left bank of the Seine downstream from Rouen, near the estuary of the river, were studied in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century but none have been realized. By public transport it is necessary to go to Rouen by train or bus (using No. 20 [[Bus Verts du Calvados|Green Bus]]). There is a Gray Coach to [[Etretat]] and [[Fécamp]] and there is VTNI for destinations in the Seine valley and Rouen who provide inter-urban services on behalf of the Department of [[Seine-Maritime]]. Finally, the company AirPlus provides a shuttle service to the train stations and airports of Paris.

For air transport, there is [[Le Havre Octeville Airport]] which is located {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Le Havre at the town of [[Octeville-sur-Mer]] and managed by [[Agglomeration community of Le Havre|CODAH]].

The main destination is the [[Transport hub]] of [[Lyon]]. Many holiday destinations are offered each year ([[Tunisia]], Balearic Islands, [[Portugal]], [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], etc.) through local travel agencies that charter aircraft. {{Vn|date=February 2014}} There is also the [[Flying club]] Jean Maridor at the airport.

The Channel maritime links with [[Portsmouth]] in southern England with [[P&O Ferries]] ended on 30 September 2005 to be taken over by [[LD Lines]] who have changed the configuration. Two services to Portsmouth are provided daily<ref name="réseaux"/> from the Terminal de la Citadelle. The link to Ireland was moved to the port of [[Cherbourg]].

Crossing times to Portsmouth vary from five hours and thirty minutes to eight hours.<ref>[http://ldlines.co.uk/timetables/le-havre-portsmouth Le Havre Portsmouth Timetables &#124;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804075204/http://ldlines.co.uk/timetables/le-havre-portsmouth |date=4 August 2012 }}, Cross Channel Ferry, LD Lines, consulted on 12 Match 2013</ref> Popular alternative routes going to areas close to Le Havre include [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] to [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], and [[Poole]] to [[Cherbourg]].

The city and the metropolitan area has a dense transport network. This solves the problem of a break between the lower town and the upper town and the two parts of the city are connected by long boulevards, winding roads, many stairs, a [[Funiculaire du Havre|funicular]], and finally the Jenner tunnel.

The [[Agglomeration community of Le Havre|CODAH]] transport network is called ''Lia''<ref name="LIA">[http://www.transports-lia.fr/presentation/index.asp?rub_code=36&thm_id=20&gpl_id= ''Who are we?''], CODAH, consulted on 27 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> and is operated by the ''Ocean Port Transport company'' (CTPO), a subsidiary of [[Veolia Transport]]. The overhaul of the bus network in 2008 helped to ensure a better service for all the towns in the metropolitan area. The CTPO operates a bus network consisting of 19 regular urban routes and six evening routes called the "Midnight Bus".<ref name="LIA"/> The Le Havre urban area is served by 165 vehicles and 41 regular bus routes with an average of 100,000 passengers per day.<ref name="LIA"/> From January 2011 there has been a regular shuttle service specific to the Industrial Zone and Port of Le Havre, thus adding to the cross-estuary service of VTNI.<ref name="réseaux"/> Since 1890 the funicular has provided a link between the upper town and the lower town in four minutes with a cable car.<ref name="guide">[http://lehavre.fr/guidemobilite/ ''Mobility Guide 2011''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116201521/http://lehavre.fr/guidemobilite/ |date=16 January 2014 }}, Ville du Havre, consulted on 20 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

Le Havre had a tramway system from 1894 until it closed in 1957. More recently a new tramway system, with 23 stations and {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} of route,<ref name=chiffres_tram>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100523191046/http://www.tramway-agglo-lehavre.fr/le-tramway-arrive/le-tramway-en-chiffres ''The Key Numbers''] (French), accessed on 20 July 2012</ref> was built, and opened on 12 December 2012. The first part of the line connects the beach to the station climbing to the upper town through a new tunnel near the Jenner tunnel then it splits into two: one link going to Mont-Gaillard, the other to Caucriauville.

Finally, since 2001 Le Havre agglomeration has operated the LER, a TER line connecting the Le Havre station to [[Rolleville]] passing through five other [[SNCF]] railway stations of the urban area.

From 2005, development work for [[Segregated cycle facilities]] have increased including a connection to the [[Greenway (landscape)|Greenway]] which promises to be an important network of quality. Between 2007 and 2011, the total length of cycle paths has doubled to {{convert|46|km|0|abbr=on}} in total length.<ref name="rapport">[http://lehavre.fr/dossier/lutter-contre-le-changement-climatique-0/ ''Annual Report on sustainable development for the city of Le Havre 2010–2011''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718010548/http://lehavre.fr/dossier/lutter-contre-le-changement-climatique-0 |date=18 July 2012 }}, Ville du Havre, consulted on 20 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> It is possible to rent bicycles through agencies of the Océane bus or from the town hall (Vel-H)<ref name="guide"/> which has them on hand.

===Lower city===

====City rebuilt after 1945====
[[File:Plan de la ville du Havre.png|thumb|Plan of Le Havre and its town centre rebuilt after the [[Second World War]]]]

Largely destroyed during the [[Second World War]], the city was rebuilt according to the plans of the architect [[Auguste Perret]] between 1945 and 1964. Only the town hall and the [[St. Joseph's Church, Le Havre|Church of Saint Joseph]] (107m high) were personally designed by Auguste Perret. In commending the reconstruction work [[UNESCO]] listed the city of Le Havre on 15 July 2005 as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name="unesco">[https://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/1181/ ''Le Havre, the city rebuilt by Auguste Perret''], UNESCO, consulted on 20 July 2012</ref> This area of 133 hectares is one of the few inscribed contemporary sites in Europe.<ref name="unesco"/> The architecture of the area is characterized by the use of precast concrete using a system of a modular frame of 6.24 metres and straight lines.<ref name="unesco"/><ref name="Letélié31">Isabelle Letélié, ''Le Havre, unusual itineraries'', Louviers, Ysec éditions, 2010, p. 31 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

Another notable architectural work of the central city is that of the ''House of Culture'' built in 1982 by the Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and nicknamed "the Volcano" because of the shape of the building.<ref name="Letélié32">Isabelle Letélié, ''Le Havre, unusual itineraries'', Louviers, Ysec éditions, 2010, p. 32 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> From 2012, this place was refurbished both inside and outside with fairly significant changes approved by the architect including greater openness to the outside of the plaza.

The Notre Dame and Perrey neighbourhoods are mainly residential. Les Halles is one of the commercial hubs of the city. The Saint Francis neighborhood was also rebuilt after 1945 {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} but in a radically different architectural style: the buildings are brick and have pitched [[slate]] roofs. This is the restaurant district and the fish market.

====Neighbourhoods====
[[File:Church Saint-Vincent.jpg|thumb|The neighborhood of the church of Saint-Vincent extending toward the coast]]

To the east and north of the rebuilt central city are a stretch of old neighbourhoods (Danton, Saint-Vincent, Graville, Massillon, etc.) which were spared the bombings of World War II. The buildings, usually in brick, dated to the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries. The shops are concentrated along several major roads in the Rond-Point neighbourhood. During the 1990s and 2000s, these neighborhoods have seen major redevelopments, particularly in the context of an OPAH: improvement of habitat by rehabilitation or reconstruction, creation of public facilities, and revitalization of business.<ref name="renovation">[http://lehavre.fr/dossier/un-centre-ancien-en-cours-de-renovation-0 ''An old centre in course of renovation''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718021250/http://lehavre.fr/dossier/un-centre-ancien-en-cours-de-renovation-0 |date=18 July 2012 }}, Ville du Havre, consulted on 20 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, the area around the railway station has undergone a major transformation. As the station is the gateway to the city with the main avenues intersecting here. New buildings have sprung up ([[University of Le Havre]], the conservatory, headquarters of the SPB (Provident Society Bank), and of [[CMA CGM]], [[Novotel]], Matmut, new CCI) some of which were designed by renowned architects. The bus station, certified ''NF'' since 2005, has been refurbished. North of the station, another construction project in place of the dilapidated island of Turgot-Magellan will be opened in 2013,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paumier-architectes.fr/project/turgot-magellan|title=Hôtel Pressense}}</ref> including {{convert|12500|m2|abbr=on}} of office space and an eight-storey hotel, complete with shops on the ground-floor.

====Southern districts====
[[File:Docks Vauban au Havre.jpg|thumb|Commercial area of the south side of the [[Vauban Docks]] in 2009]]

The southern districts of Le Havre are mainly used for industrial and port activities. There are buildings in brick from the 19th century, large developments (Chicago, Les Neiges), worker estates, SMEs, warehouses, dock and port facilities, and transport infrastructure. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The southern districts have for some years experienced profound change due to European funding. It is revitalizing areas neglected by industrial and port activities by developing tertiary activities. Thus, the docks have been completely transformed into sports and entertainment complexes ([[Dock Océane]]), a mall (Docks Vauban), and an exhibition hall (Docks Café). [[Les Bains Des Docks]] was designed by the architect [[Jean Nouvel]]. At the end of 2012 students from Sciences-Po Europe Asia and from INSA integrated new buildings next to the ISEL (Higher Institute of logistics studies) and the future ENSM (Ecole Nationale Supérieure Maritime).<ref name="sciencespo">[http://lehavre.fr/dossier/science-po-et-l-insa-institut-national-des-sciences-appliquees-codah-0 ''Parks and Gardens of Le Havre''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718113240/http://lehavre.fr/dossier/science-po-et-l-insa-institut-national-des-sciences-appliquees-codah-0 |date=18 July 2012 }}, Sciences Po and INSA, consulted on 20 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The new medical axis around the new ''Clinic des Ormeaux'' was built in the neighbourhoods where many homes are planned with the aim of promoting social mix.

===Upper town===
[[File:Cimetiere ste marie.jpg|thumb|The cemetery of Sainte-Marie]]

The upper town is composed of three parts: the "coast", the suburban districts of the plateau, and large peripheral housing estates.

The neighbourhoods on the "coast" (the Dead Cliff) are residential – more prosperous in the western part (Les Ormeaux, Rue Felix Faure) and more modest to the east (St. Cecilia, Aplemont). The Jenner tunnel passes under the "coast" and connects the upper town to the lower town. It is also on the coast that there are two [[fortifications]] of the city, Forts [[Sainte-Adresse]] and Tourneville, and the main cemetery (Sainte-Marie cenetery). With the demise of the military functions of the city, the forts are gradually being converted: Fort Sainte-Adresse houses the ''Hanging Gardens'' and Fort Tourneville hosted the Tetris project in 2013 – an axis of contemporary music with concert halls and rehearsal studios.<ref name="tetris">[http://lehavre.fr/dossier/le-fort-de-tourneville-0 ''Tourneville Fort''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718013824/http://lehavre.fr/dossier/le-fort-de-tourneville-0 |date=18 July 2012 }}, Ville du Havre, consulted on 20 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

To the north of the "coast" suburban districts such as Rouelles, Sainte-Cecile, la Mare au Clerc, Sanvic, Bleville, and Dollemard were developed during the first half of the 19th century.<ref name="chiffres clés quartiers"/> In their extension North-west between Bleville and Octeville airport a new area is being developed: "Les Hauts de Bleville". This eco-district made up of housing units to [[HQE]] standards, a Joint Development Area (ZAC), and a school should have a total of 1,000 housing units.<ref>[http://www.ville-lehavre.fr/delia-CMS/dossier/index/article_id-28162/ext-1/first_article_id-28148/plus-1/topic_id-789/le-projet.html ''The eco-district "Les Hauts de Bléville"'']{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Ville du Havre, consulted on 31 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

The peripheral suburbs of the commune grew in the postwar period. These are large [[housing estate]]s in Caucriauville, Bois de Bleville, Mont-Gaillard, and Mare-rouge where a disadvantaged population is concentrated. In October 2004 the National Agency for Urban Renewal (ANRU) signed with the municipality of Havre the first agreement to finance the rehabilitation of these areas. This finance agreement provides more than 340&nbsp;million euros for the housing estates in the northern districts, where about 41,000 people reside. This development extends the budget for the ''Grand Projet de Ville'' (GPV). It allows the demolition and rebuilding of more than 1,700 homes.

==History==
{{main|History of Le Havre|Timeline of Le Havre}}
[[File:The Place Gambetta and docks, Havre, France-LCCN2001698147.jpg|thumb|Le Havre in the late 19th century]]
When founded in 1517, the city was named ''Franciscopolis'' after [[Francis I of France]]. It was subsequently named ''Le Havre-de-Grâce'' ("Harbor of Grace"; hence [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]]). Its construction was ordered to replace the ancient harbours of [[Honfleur]] and [[Harfleur]] whose utility had decreased due to silting.

The history of the city is inextricably linked to its harbour. In the 18th century, as trade from the [[West Indies]] was added to that of France and Europe, Le Havre began to grow.  On 19 November 1793, the city changed its name to Hâvre de Marat and later Hâvre-Marat in honor of the recently deceased [[Jean-Paul Marat]], who was seen as a martyr of the [[French Revolution]].  By early 1795, however, Marat's memory had become somewhat tarnished, and on 13 January 1795, Hâvre-Marat changed its name once more to simply Le Havre, its modern name. During the 19th century, it became an industrial center.

At the end of World War I Le Havre played a major role as the transit port used to wind up affairs after the war.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bullock |first=Arthur |title=Gloucestershire Between the Wars: A Memoir |publisher=The History Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7524-4793-3}} Pages 102-110.</ref>

The city was devastated during the [[Battle of Normandy]] when 5,000 people were killed and 12,000 homes were totally destroyed before its capture in [[Operation Astonia]]. The center was rebuilt in a [[Modernism|modernist]] style by [[Auguste Perret]].

===Toponymy===
The name of the town was attested in 1489, even before it was founded by [[François I]] in the form ''le Hable de Grace'' then ''Ville de Grace'' in 1516, two years before its official founding.<ref name="Beaurepaire-92-93">François de Beaurepaire (pref. Marianne Mulon), ''The names of Communes and former parishes of Seine-Maritime'', Paris, A. et J. Picard, 1979, 180 p., {{ISBN|2-7084-0040-1}}, {{OCLC|6403150}}, p. 92-93 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The learned and transient name of ''Franciscopolis'' in tribute to the same king, is encountered in some documents then that of ''Havre Marat'', referring to [[Jean-Paul Marat]] during the [[French Revolution]] but was not imposed. However it explains why the complementary determinant ''-de-Grace'' was not restored.<ref name="Beaurepaire-92-93"/> This qualifier undoubtedly referred to the Chapel of Notre Dame located at the site of the [[Le Havre Cathedral|cathedral of the same name]]. The chapel faced the Chapel Notre Dame de Grace of [[Honfleur]] across the estuary.<ref name="Beaurepaire-92-93"/> The common noun ''havre'' meaning "port" was out of use at the end of the 18th or beginning of the 19th centuries but is still preserved in the phrase ''havre de paix'' meaning "safe haven". It is generally considered a loan from [[Middle Dutch]] from the 12th century.<ref>[http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/Havre Lexicographic definitions] and [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/Havre etymologies] of ''Havre'', TLFi, on the CNRTL website {{in lang|fr}}</ref> A Germanic origin can explain the "aspiration" of the initial ''h''.

New research however focuses on the fact that the term was attested very early (12th century) and in [[Norman language|Norman texts]] in the forms ''Hable'', ''hafne'', ''havene'', ''havne'', and ''haule'' makes a Dutch origin unlikely. By contrast, a [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]] etymology is relevant given the old Scandinavian ''höfn'' (genitive ''hafnar'') or ''hafn'' meaning "natural harbour" or "haven" and the phonetic evolution of the term ''[[Stem (ship)|étrave]]'' which is assuredly of Scandinavian origin is also attested in similar forms such as ''estable'' and probably dates back to the ancient Scandinavian ''stafn''.<ref>Elisabeth Ridel, ''The Vikings and the words: The contribution of old Scandinavian to the French language'', éditions errance, Paris, 2009, p. 203, 226, 227, 228. {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

For the parliamentary elections, Le Havre spans two constituencies: the seventh (cantons I, V, VI, and VII) and the eighth (cantons II, III, IV, VIII, IX).<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/qui/communes/result_new.asp?legislature=14&commune=le+havre&canton=&choix_dept=num&dept=&Rechercher=Lancer+la+recherche ''Research on constituencies by commune or by canton''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116191307/http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/qui/communes/result_new.asp?legislature=14&commune=le+havre&canton=&choix_dept=num&dept=&Rechercher=Lancer+la+recherche |date=16 January 2014 }}, National Assembly, consulted on 24 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

===Political trends and results===
Several politicians have spent part of their lives in the city: Jules Lecesne (1818–1878), [[Jules Siegfried]] (1837–1922), and [[Félix Faure]] (1841–1899) were elected as municipal councillors and MPs. A pool, a shopping centre and a street have been named after [[René Coty]] from Le Havre, who served as [[President of the French Republic]] from 1954 to 1959. [[Christine Lagarde]] (born 1956) attended high schools in Le Havre before becoming [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|Minister of the Economy]] and Director-General of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in 2011.

Since 23 October 2010 the [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] has been Édouard Philippe ([[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]). He also holds the presidency of the [[Agglomeration community of Le Havre|CODAH]] and has held a seat in the National Assembly for the 7th district of Seine-Maritime since 2012.<ref name="Philippe">[http://lehavre.fr/dossier/edouard-philippe-0 ''Edouard Philippe''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718090912/http://lehavre.fr/dossier/edouard-philippe-0 |date=18 July 2012 }}, Ville du Havre, consulted on 24 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> He succeeded [[Antoine Rufenacht]] (UMP), who was mayor of Le Havre for fifteen years before resigning, as the head of the municipality. The city of Le Havre has long been the strongest bastion of the [[Communist Party of France]], who directed it from 1956 to 1995.<ref name="Gras47">Pierre Gras, ''The time of Ports.

===Public institutions and services===
[[File:LeHavrePalaisJustice.jpg|thumb|The Palace of Justice]]

The Le Havre Palace of Justice is located on the Boulevard de Strasbourg. With its annex, it includes a high court, a juvenile court, and a commercial court. The city also has a Labour Court and District Court. Among the legal services offered there are legal aid services and the application of penalties. Le Havre depends on the [[Court of Appeal (France)|Court of Appeal]] of Rouen. The prison, which dates from the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], was completely destroyed in 2012. The new prison for Le Havre was completed in 2010 at [[Saint-Aubin-Routot]] east of the Le Havre agglomeration. It has an area of 32,000 m2 on a site of 15 hectares and can accommodate 690 people.<ref>[http://www.annuaires.justice.gouv.fr/etablissements-penitentiaires-10113/direction-interregionale-de-lille-10124/le-havre-10710.html Le Havre, Ministry of Justice], consulted on 24 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

The ''Hospital Group of Havre'' is a public health facility managed by a Supervisory Board chaired by the [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Le Havre. Its main structures are Flaubert Hospital (the oldest, located downtown), the Monod Hospital (in [[Montivilliers]]), the Pierre Janet Hospital (psychiatry), the house for adolescents, day hospitals, and seniors' residences. It is the largest employer in the CODAH. Built in 1987, the Jacques Monod Hospital offers a full range of care in medicine, surgery, gynecology, obstetrics, pediatrics, geriatrics, mental health follow-up care, rehabilitation, reintegration, and public health.

Finally, there are several private clinics that offer complete care: the private clinic of the Estuary groups together the old clinics of ''Petit Colmoulins'' and François I. The private clinic of Ormeaux is located in the neighbourhood of Eure.

During the first half of the 20th century, the 129th regiment of infantry of the line was stationed at Le Havre and left an important mark on the city so a street was named after them. The 74th Infantry Regiment of commandos was present from 1963 to 1976. Finally, Le Havre is the godmother city for [[Mistral-class amphibious assault ship|BPC Mistral]]. The ceremony was held at the City Hall on 15 November 2009, during a stopover at the Building.<ref>[http://www.ville-lehavre.fr/delia-CMS/archives_oceanes/index/article_id-39255/ext-1/plus-1/theme-82/le-mistral-en-escale.html Le Havre, Marine city of Mistral]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, November 2009, Océanes Le Havre {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

==Demographics==
[[File:Plan de la ville du Havre.png|thumb|right|Downtown Le Havre]]

Le Havre experienced a population boom in the second half of the 19th century. Subsequently, the population drain of the [[First World War]] was offset by the annexation of the town of Graville (the city gained 27,215 people between 1911 and 1921). During the [[Second World War]] the population decreased significantly (a loss of 57,149 people between 1936 and 1946) because of the exodus and bombings. After the war the commune saw its population increase until 1975. Since then population has decreased again, especially between 1975 and 1982: during these years of industrial crisis the population fell by 18,494 people. The trend continued in the 1980s although at a slower pace. The current policy of the municipality is to build new housing to attract new residents with the goal of exceeding 200,000 inhabitants, a level that was reached in the 1960s. The population of the commune of Le Havre was 191,000 inhabitants in 1999 which placed the city at 12th place among the most populated cities in France and in the first place in [[Normandy]]. In 2017 [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]] counted 170,147 people living in the commune of Le Havre,<ref name="complet">[https://insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2011101?geo=COM-76351 Dossier complet: Commune du Havre (76351)], INSEE, 2020, consulted on 14 August 2020 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> while the [[Unité urbaine|urban area]] of Le Havre had 235,218 inhabitants and the [[metropolitan area]] of Le Havre had 288,973 inhabitants.<ref name=insee2017>[https://insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=COM-76351+UU2010-76701+AU2010-032 Comparateur de territoire], [[INSEE]], consulted on 14 August 2020 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

In 2017, the commune had 170,147 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger towns that have a sample survey every year.<ref group=Note>At the beginning of the 21st century, the methods of identification have been modified by law No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002 [https://web.archive.org/web/20130514005038/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100&fastPos=1&fastReqId=2036940488&categorieLien=cid&oldAction=rechTexte ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306074946/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100 |date= 6 March 2016 }}, the so-called "law of local democracy" and in particular Title V "census operations" which allow, after a transitional period running from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For municipalities with a population greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is conducted annually, the entire territory of these municipalities is taken into account at the end of the period of five years. The first "legal population" after 1999 under this new law came into force on 1 January 2009 and was based on the census of 2006.</ref>

===Events===
Le Havre has been and is still the venue of major sports events: the Tour de France has passed a dozen times by the Ocean Gate, the last stage took place here in 2015. Sailing events are often held and the [[Transat Jacques Vabre]] transatlantic race has been held every two years since 1993 linking Le Havre to Latin America. The course of the [[Solitaire du Figaro]] was partly in Le Havre in 2010. Since 2006, weekends of freestyle board sports have been popular (skateboarding, rollerblading, funboard, kiteboarding, skydiving etc.). Every summer roller blade events are organized in the city on Friday evening every fortnight and have great success. The first International Triathlon was held in 2012.<ref>''Océanes Le Havre'', No. 157, Summer 2012, p. 17 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Finally, there are several opportunities for runners with ten kilometres ({{convert|10|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) in Le Havre or the strides of Montgeon.

==Media==

===Religion===
[[File:LeHavreCathedrale4.JPG|thumb|The nave of [[Le Havre Cathedral]].]]

At the request of Monsigneur André Mulch, [[Archbishop of Rouen]], [[Pope Paul VI]] decided on 6 July 1974 through the [[papal bull]] ''Quae Sacrosanctum'' on the creation of the [[diocese of Le Havre]] (''Portus Gratiae'' in [[Latin]] meaning "Port of Grace"). The diocese was created from part of the parishes of the [[Archdiocese of Rouen]] to the west of a line joining [[Norville]] to [[Sassetot-le-Mauconduit]]. Monseigneur Michel Saudreau, its first bishop, was ordained on 22 September 1974. The church of Notre Dame was promoted to [[le Havre Cathedral|Cathedral Notre Dame du Havre]]. Today, the commune of Le Havre is divided into eight [[parishes]]<ref name="Diocèse">[http://catholique-lehavre.cef.fr/3_les_paroisses_du_diocese/3_26_zone_le_havre_sainte_adresse/Page%20zone%20Le%20Havre%20Sainte%20Adresse.php Le Havre-Sainte-Adresse], diocèse of Le Havre, consulted on 4 April 2008 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> and 24 places of worship (churches and chapels). The oldest chapel is Saint-Michel d'Ingouville which dates back to the 11th century. The [[St. Joseph's Church, Le Havre|Church of Saint Joseph du Havre]], built by [[Auguste Perret]], dominates the city with its spire 107m high. There are several monastic establishments (Carmel of the Transfiguration, [[Franciscan]] Monastery, [[Little Sisters of the Poor]], etc.).

The Protestant Church of Le Havre was built in the city centre in 1862. Bombed in 1941, it lost its [[pediment]], its [[bell tower]], and roof. Rebuilt in 1953 by the architects Jacques Lamy and Gérard Dupasquier,<ref name="Steiner114">C. Étienne-Steiner, ''Le Havre. City, Port, and conurbation'', Rouen, édition du patrimoine, 1999, p. 114 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> who worked in the Auguste Perret office, is the only building in Le Havre uniting the original architecture of the 19th century with the architecture of the Perret school. Le Havre also has seven evangelical Protestant churches: ''Salvation Army'', ''Seventh Day Adventist'', ''Apostolic Church'', ''Assembly of God'', ''Baptist Church'', ''Good News Church'', et ''Church of Le Havre'' as well as several Protestant churches of African origin.

The city also has seven Muslim places of worship: the socio-cultural association of Muslims in Upper Normandy, En-Nour Mosque on Rue Paul Claudel, El Fath Mosque on rue Victor Hugo, Bellevue mosque on rue Gustavus Brindeau, and three prayer rooms located on rue Audran, Boulevard Jules Durant, and rue Lodi.

==Economy==

===General===
Although well developed and diversified, the local economy relies heavily on industrial sites, international groups, and subcontracted [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]]s. The Le Havre economy is far from decision centres which are located mainly in Paris and major European economic cities. There is therefore a low representation of head offices in the city with the exception of some local economic successes such as the Sidel Group (now a subsidiary of [[Tetra Pak]]) – a distributor of interior furniture, and the [[ship-owner]] [[Delmas (shipping company)|Delmas]] which was recently acquired by the [[CMA-CGM]] group.

The two largest employers in the service sector are the ''Groupe Hospitalier du Havre'' with 4,384 staff<ref name="groupe hospi">[http://eportail.ch-havre.fr/portal/page/portal/ver-1/WWW_COMMUN/Le%20GHH/Le%20GHH%20et%20vous/Presentation%20generale/Chiffres%20cles/Donn%C3%A9es%20%20cl%C3%A9s%202012%20version%20web.pdf?_template= Presentation and key data], Groupe Hospitalier du Havre, consulted on 30 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> and the ''City of Le Havre'' with 3,467 permanent employees.<ref name="recrute">[http://lehavre.fr/dossier/la-ville-recrute-0 The City recruits] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801130512/http://lehavre.fr/dossier/la-ville-recrute-0 |date=1 August 2012 }}, Ville du Havre, consulted on 30 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The city has long been home to many service companies whose activity is related to port operations: primarily the ship-owning companies and also the [[marine insurance]] companies. The headquarters of [[Delmas (shipping company)|Delmas]] (transport and communications, 1,200 employees) and SPB (Provident Society Banking, insurance, 500 employees) have settled recently at the entrance to the city. The head office of Groupama Transport (300 employees) is also present.

The transport sector is the largest economic sector in Le Havre with 15.5% of employment. Logistics occupies a large part of the population and the [[Industrial Syndicalist Education League|ISEL]] trains engineers in this field. Since September 2007 the ICC has welcomed local students in their first year in the relocated Europe-Asia campus of the [[Sciences Po|Institute of Political Studies of Paris]]. Higher Education is represented by the [[University of Le Havre]] which employs 399 permanent professors and 850 lecturers<ref name="chiffres université">[http://www.univ-lehavre.fr/ulh_services/Chiffres.html University of Le Havre data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211225814/http://www.univ-lehavre.fr/ulh_services/Chiffres.html |date=11 February 2012 }}, Université du Havre, consulted on 26 July 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> as well as by engineering companies like Auxitec and SERO.

There are many growth factors in the tourist industry: [[Blue Flag beach|blue flag]] rating, World Heritage status from UNESCO, the label ''[[French Towns and Lands of Art and History]]'', cruise ship development, a policy of value-creation from heritage, and the ''City of the Sea'' project. In January 2020 the city had 26 hotels with a total of 1,428 rooms.<ref name="complet"/>

== Culture==

===Events and festivals===
[[File:Le Havre (France) fête des bretons dans le quartier Saint-François.JPG|thumb|Breton Festival in the Saint-François district]]
Le Havre's festival calendar is punctuated by a wide range of events.

In spring a ''Children's Book Festival'' was recently created. In May there is the ''Fest Yves'', a Breton festival in the Saint-François district. On the beach of Le Havre and Sainte-Adresse there is a [[jazz]] festival called ''Dixie Days'' in June. In July, [[detective novels]] are featured in the Polar room at the Beach hosted by ''The Black Anchors''. Between the latter also in the context of ''Z'Estivales'' is an event offering many shows of [[street art]] throughout the summer supplemented by the festival of world music ''MoZaïques'' at the fort of Sainte-Adresse in August since 2010. In mid-August there is a [[Flower parade]] which passes through the streets of the central city.

In the first weekend of September the marine element is highlighted in the ''Festival of the Sea''. This is a race between Le Havre and [[Bahia]] in Brazil. Also every November there is a fair held in the Docks Café. The Autumn Festival in Normandy, organized by the departments of [[Seine-Maritime]] and [[Eure]], and the Region of [[Normandy]], runs from September to November and offers numerous concerts throughout the region as well as theatre performances and dance. In late October, since 2009, there is rock music festival which has been at the fort of Tourneville since the moving of the ''Papa's Production'' association site there. The West Park Festival, after its inauguration in 2004, has been held in the park of the town hall of Harfleur.

Since 1 June 2006 a ''Biennale of contemporary Art'' has been organized by the group ''Partouche''.<ref>[http://lehavre.fr/rubrique/evenements-culturels Cultural Events] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910223937/http://lehavre.fr/rubrique/evenements-culturels |date=10 September 2012 }}, Ville du Havre, consulted on 9 October 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

===Cultural heritage and architecture===
[[File:Panorama lh.JPG|thumb|View of the rebuilt central city: the belfry of the town hall and the bell tower of the ''Church of Saint-Joseph du Havre''.]]
[[File:Abbaye de Graville ensoleillée (Le Havre, France).jpg|thumb|Graville Abbey]]

Many buildings in the city are classified as "historical monuments", but the 2000s marked the real recognition of Le Havre's architectural heritage. The city received the label "City of Art and History" in 2001, then in 2005 [[UNESCO]] inscribed the city of Le Havre as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name="Unesco">{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/1181/|title=Le Havre, la ville reconstruite par Auguste Perret|first=UNESCO Centre du patrimoine|last=mondial|website=UNESCO Centre du patrimoine mondial}}</ref>

The oldest building still standing in Le Havre is the Graville Abbey. The other medieval building in the city is the Chapel of Saint-Michel of Ingouville. Because of the bombing in 1944, heritage from the [[modern era]] is rare: ''[[Le Havre Cathedral]]'', the ''Church of Saint Francis'', the ''Museum of the Hotel Dubocage of Bleville'', the ''House of the ship-owner'' and the old palace of justice (now the ''Natural History Museum'') are concentrated in the Notre-Dame and Saint-François areas. The buildings of the 19th century testify to the maritime and military vocations of the city: the ''Hanging Gardens'', the ''Fort of Tourneville'', ''Vauban docks'', and the ''Maritime Villa''. The heritage of the 1950s and 1960s which were the work of the [[Auguste Perret]] workshop forms the most coherent architecture: the ''Church of Saint Francis'' and the Town Hall are the centrepieces. The all curved architecture of the ''"Volcano"'', designed by [[Oscar Niemeyer]], contrasts with that of the rebuilt centre. Finally, the reconstruction of many districts is a showcase for the architecture of the 21st century. Among the achievements by renowned architects are the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (René and Phine Weeke Dottelond), [[Les Bains Des Docks]] ([[Jean Nouvel]]).<ref name="Unesco"/>

;Musée d'histoire naturelle (Museum of Natural History).
Founded in 1881 but heavily damaged during World War II, the Museum of Natural History is housed in Le Havre's former law courts, built in the mid-18th century; the façade and monumental staircase are listed as historical monuments. The museum houses mineralogy, zoology, ornithology, palaeontology and prehistory departments as well as 8,000 early 19th-century paintings from the collection of local naturalist and traveller [[Charles-Alexandre Lesueur]] (1778–1846).<ref>[http://lehavre.fr/dossier/collection-lesueur-0 Lesueur Collection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802192844/http://lehavre.fr/dossier/collection-lesueur-0 |date=2 August 2012 }}, Ville du Havre, consulted on 2 August 2012 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The museum was destroyed during Allied bombings on 5 September 1944. The library was lost, along with its collections of photographs, scientific instruments and archives. The mineral and geological collections were all destroyed, including a rare collection of local mineral specimens of [[Normandy]]. The destruction of the museum was so intense, that all the catalogues, lists of donations, lists of purchases and other archives prevented even a precise inventory of all that was lost."<ref>"Les Collections Biologiques du Muséum avant le désastre du 5 Septembre 1944."

===Representations in visual arts===
[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpg|thumb|Claude Monet, ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'', 1872, painted in the Port of Le Havre.]]

The Port of Le Havre and the light on the estuary of the Seine inspired many painters: [[Louis-Philippe Crepin]] (1772–1851), [[Jean-Baptiste Corot]] (1796–1875), [[Eugène Isabey]] (1803–1886), [[Theodore Gudin]] (1802–1880), [[Adolphe-Felix Cals]] (1810–1880), [[Jean-François Millet]] (1814–1875) in 1845,<ref name="Millet">Alfred Sensier, ''The Life and works of J.-F Millet'', A. Quantin, 1881. {{in lang|fr}}</ref> [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–1877) etc.. It is to [[Eugène Boudin]] (1824–1898) who created many representations of Le Havre in the 19th century. The artist lived for a time in the city. Thanks to its proximity to [[Honfleur]], Le Havre was also represented by foreign artists such as [[William Turner (artist)|William Turner]], [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], [[Alfred Stevens (painter)|Alfred Stevens]], and [[Richard Parkes Bonington]].

[[File:MuMA - Pissaro - L'avant-port du Havre. Matin. Soleil.

[[Claude Monet]] (1840–1926), a resident of Le Havre from the age of five, in 1872 painted ''Impression soleil levant'' ([[Impression, Sunrise]]), a painting that gave its name to the [[impressionist]] movement. In 1867–1868, he painted many seascapes in the Le Havre region (''Terrasse a Sainte-Adresse'' ([[Garden at Sainte-Adresse (Monet)|Garden at Sainte-Adresse]]), 1867 ''Bateaux quittant le port'' (Boats Leaving the Port), 1874). The [[Musée Malraux]] houses some of his paintings : Waterlilies, London Parliament et Winter Sun at Lavacourt. Two other Impressionists, [[Camille Pissarro]] (1830–1903) and [[Maxime Maufra]] (1861–1918) also represented the port of Le Havre which also inspired [[Paul Signac]] (1863–1935), [[Albert Marquet]] (1875–1947), and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] (1876–1958).

Then came the school of [[Fauvism]] in which many artists did their training at Le Havre: [[Othon Friesz]] (1879–1949), Henri de Saint-Delis (1876–1958), [[Raoul Dufy]] (1877–1953), [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963), Raymond Lecourt (1882–1946), Albert Copieux (1885–1956), who followed the course of the ''School of Fine Arts of Le Havre'' in the time of Charles Lhuillier. They left a number of paintings on the theme of the city and the port. In 1899, [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] (1864–1901) painted  ''La serveuse anglaise du Star'' (The English waitress of Star) (Museum Toulouse-Lautrec, Albi) of a girl he met in a bar in the city.

Other painters who painted Le Havre and/or its surroundings such as Sainte-Adresse can be cited in particular: [[Frédéric Bazille]], John Gendall, [[Thomas Couture]], [[Ambroise Louis Garneray]], [[Pablo Picasso]] (''Souvenir du Havre''). [[Jean Dubuffet]] studied at the School of Art in Le Havre.

The film by [[Sophie Marceau]], ''[[Trivial (film)|La Disparue de Deauville]]'', made in 2007, contains many scenes around the port of Le Havre, in the Coty shopping centre of Coty and in the streets of the central city.

The film ''[[Le Havre (film)|Le Havre]]'' by [[Aki Kaurismäki]] received two prizes at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] and also the [[Louis Delluc Prize]].<ref name="Le Monde">[http://www.lemonde.fr/cinema/article/2011/12/16/aki-kaurismaki-remporte-le-prix-louis-delluc-pour-le-havre_1619890_3476.html Aki Kaurismäki wins the Louis-Delluc Prize for Le Havre], Le Monde, 16 December 2011, consulted on 19 December 2011 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> It was nominated three times for the [[37th César Awards]].

===Literature===
[[File:Bernardin de Saint-Pierre statue Le Havre.jpg|thumb|Statue of the writer [[Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] in front of the before the Law Courts in Le Havre.]]

Le Havre appears in several literary works as a point of departure to America: in the 18th century, [[Antoine François Prévost|Father Prevost]] embarked ''[[Manon Lescaut]]'' and ''Des Grieux'' for [[French Louisiana]]. Fanny Loviot departed from Le Havre in 1852, as an emigrant to San Francisco and points further west, and recounted her adventures in ''Les pirates chinois'' (''A Lady's Captivity among Chinese Pirates in the Chinese Seas'', 1858).

In the 19th century, Le Havre was the setting for several French novels: [[Honoré de Balzac]] described the failure of a Le Havre merchant family in ''[[Modeste Mignon]]''. Later, the Norman writer [[Guy de Maupassant]] located several of his works at Le Havre such as ''Au muséum d'histoire naturelle'' (At the Museum of Natural History) a text published in ''Le Gaulois'' on 23 March 1881 and again in ''[[Pierre et Jean]]''. [[Alphonse Allais]] located his intrigues at Le Havre too. ''[[La Bête humaine]]'' (The Human Beast) by [[Émile Zola]] evokes the world of the railway and runs along the [[Paris–Le Havre railway]]. Streets, buildings, and public places in Le Havre pay tribute to other famous Le Havre people from this period: the writer [[Casimir Delavigne]] (1793–1843) has a street named after him and a statue in front of the palace of justice alongside another man of letters, [[Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] (1737–1814).

In the 20th century, [[Henry Miller]] located part of the action in Le Havre in his masterpiece ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', published in 1934. [[Bouville, Seine-Maritime|Bouville]] was the commune where the writer lived who wrote his diary in  ''La Nausée'' (The Nausea) (1938) by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was inspired by Le Havre city where he wrote his first novel. There are also the testimonies of [[Raymond Queneau]] (1903–1976), born in Le Havre, the city served as a framework for his novel ''Un rude hiver'' (A harsh winter) (1939). The plot of ''Une maison soufflée aux vents'' (A house blown to the winds) by [[Emile Danoën]], winner of the Popular Novel Prize in 1951, and its sequel ''Idylle dans un quartier muré'' (Idyll in a walled neighbourhood) were located in Le Havre during the [[Second World War]]. Under the name ''Port de Brume'' Le Havre is the setting for three other novels by this author: ''Cerfs-volants'' (Kites), ''L'Aventure de Noël'' (The Adventure at Christmas), and ''La Queue à la pègre'' (Queue to the underworld). [[Michel Leiris]] wrote ''De la littérature considérée comme une tauromachie'' (Of literature considered like a bullfight) in December 1945.

[[Diana Gabaldon]] set the second novel in her [[Outlander series|''Outlander'' series]], ''[[Dragonfly in Amber]]'' (1992), partly in Le Havre.

Two [[mystery novels]] take place in Le Havre: ''Le Bilan Maletras'' (The Maletras Balance) by [[Georges Simenon]] and ''Le Crime de Rouletabille'' (Crime at the Roulette table) by [[Gaston Leroux]]. In ''[[Rouge Brésil]]'' (Red Brazil), winner of the [[Prix Goncourt|Goncourt Prize]] in 2001, [[Jean-Christophe Rufin]] describes Le Havre in the 16th century as the port of departure of French expeditions to the [[New World]]: the hero [[Villegagnon]] leaves of the port to conquer new lands for the French crown which become [[Brazil]]. Martine–Marie Muller tells the saga of a clan of [[Stevedore]]s from Le Havre in the 1950s to the 1970s in ''Quai des Amériques'' (Quay of the Americas).

[[Benoît Duteurtre]] published in 2001, ''Le Voyage en France'' (Travel in France), for which he received the [[Prix Médicis]]: the main character, a young American impassioned by France, lands at Le Havre which he describes in the first part of the novel. In 2008, Benoît Duteurtre publishes ''Les pieds dans l'eau'' (Feet in the water), a highly autobiographical book in which he describes his youth spent between Le Havre and [[Etretat]]. The city hosted writers such as [[Emile Danoën]] (1920–1999) who grew up in the district of Saint-François, Yoland Simon (born 1941), and Philippe Huet (born 1955). Canadian poet [[Octave Crémazie]] (1827–1879) died at Le Havre and was buried in Saint Marie Cemetery. The playwright [[Jacques-François Ancelot]] (1794–1854) was also a native of Le Havre. Two famous historians, [[Gabriel Monod]] (1844–1912) and [[André Siegfried]] (1875–1959) were from the city.

Le Havre also appears in comic books: for example, in  ''[[L'Oreille cassée]]'' (The Broken Ear) (1937), [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] embarks on the vessel ''City of Lyon'' sailing to South America. The meeting between Tintin and [[General Alcazar]] in ''Les Sept Boules de cristal'' ([[The Seven Crystal Balls]]) (1948) is in Le Havre, according to notes by [[Hergé]] in the margins of [[Le Soir]], the first publisher of this adventure. The first adventure of [[Ric Hochet]] (1963), the designer [[Tibet (comics)|Tibet]] and [[André-Paul Duchâteau]], ''Traquenard au Havre'' (Trap at Le Havre) shows the seaside and the port. Similarly, in 1967, for the album ''Rapt sur le France'' (Rapt on France), the hero passes by the ocean port. [[Frank Le Gall]], in  ''Novembre toute l'année'' (November all year) (2000) embarks Theodore Poussin at Le Havre on the ''Cap Padaran''.

=== Music===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}

Le Havre is the birthplace of many musicians and composers such as Henri Woollett (1864–1936), [[André Caplet]] (1878–1925) and [[Arthur Honegger]] (1892–1955). There was also Victor Mustel (1815–1890) who was famous for having perfected the [[Pump organ|harmonium]].

Le Havre has long been regarded as one of the cradles of French rock and [[blues]]. In the 1980s many groups have emerged after a first dynamic development in the 1960s and 1970s. The most famous personality of Le Havre rock is ''Little Bob'' who began his career in the 1970s. The port tradition in many of the groups was repeated in the unused sheds of the port, such as Bovis hall which could hold 20,000 spectators. A blues festival, driven by Jean-François Skrobek, Blues a Gogo existed for eight years from 1995 to 2002. Several artists have been produced such as: [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Popa Chubby]], [[Amadou & Mariam]], [[Patrick Verbeke]] etc. It was organized by the Coup de Bleu association whose former president was head of music Café ''[[L'Agora]]'' in the Niemeyer Centre which produced the new Le Havre scene. During these same years, the ''Festival of the Future'', the local version of the ''[[Fête de l'Humanité]]'' (Festival of Humanity), attracted a large audience.

Currently, the musical tradition continues in the Symphony Orchestra of the city of Le Havre, the orchestra of Concerts André Caplet, the conservatory, and music schools such as the Centre for Vocal and Musical Expression (rock) or the JUPO (mainly [[jazz]]), associations or labels like Papa's Production (la Folie Ordinaire, Mob's et Travaux, Dominique Comont, Souinq, Your Happy End etc.). The organization by the association of West Park Festival since the 2000s in [[Harfleur]] and since 2004 at the Fort of Tourneville is a demonstration. Moreover, since 2008, the association ''I Love LH'' was started and promotes Le Havre culture and especially its music scene by organizing original cultural events as well as the free distribution of compilation music by local artists.
