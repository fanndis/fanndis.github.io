'''Joachim Wilhelm Gauck''' ({{IPA-de|joˈʔaxiːm ɡaʊ̯k|lang|De-Joachim Gauck.ogg}}; born 24 January 1940) is a German politician and civil rights activist who served as [[President of Germany]] from 2012 to 2017. A former [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[pastor]], he came to prominence as an [[anti-communist]] [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] [[activism|activist]] in [[East Germany]].<ref name="rfe-rl"/><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/world/europe/joachim-gaucks-background-seen-as-an-asset-in-germany.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&seid=auto&smid=tw-nytimesglobal "German Presidential Nominee’s Background Seen as an Asset"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 February 2012</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100630-2010-german--president-merkel-gauck-wulff-political-test-afghanistan-resign-cdu-greens-fdp |title=A crucial test for Angela Merkel |publisher=FRANCE 24 |date= 30 June 2010|access-date=21 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15751782,00.html |title=Gauck's civic engagement wins him wide support |publisher=DW.DE |date=17 February 2012 |access-date=21 February 2012}}</ref>

During the [[Peaceful Revolution]] in 1989, he was a co-founder of the [[New Forum]] opposition movement in East Germany, which contributed to the downfall of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) and later with two other movements formed the electoral list [[Alliance 90]]. In 1990 he was a member of the only freely elected East German [[People's Chamber]] in the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]] faction. Following [[German reunification]], he was elected as a member of the [[Bundestag]] by the People's Chamber in 1990 but resigned after a single day having been chosen by the Bundestag to be the first [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]], serving from 1990 to 2000. He earned recognition in this position as a "[[Stasi]] hunter" and "tireless pro-democracy advocate", exposing the crimes of the communist secret police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20100604-27645.html|title=German media roundup: Little excitement for Wulff presidency|work=thelocal.de|date=4 June 2010|access-date=30 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wn.de/Archiv/2010/06/Politik-Inland-Joachim-Gauck-der-Stasi-Jaeger |title=Politik Inland : Joachim Gauck, der Stasi-Jäger – Archiv – Westfälische Nachrichten |language=de |publisher=Wn.de |date=30 June 2010 |access-date=20 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,816407,00.html |title=Germany's Next President: 'I'm No Superman' – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= 20 February 2012|access-date=20 February 2012|newspaper=Spiegel Online |last1=Gathmann |first1=Florian }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-20/merkel-names-gauck-as-unity-candidate-for-german-presidency.html |title=Merkel Names Gauck as Unity Candidate for German Presidency |magazine=Businessweek |date=8 December 2009 |access-date=20 February 2012}}</ref>

==Childhood and life in East Germany (1940–1989)==
Joachim Gauck was born into a family of sailors in [[Rostock]], the son of Olga (née Warremann; born 1910) and Joachim Gauck, Sr. (born 1907). His father was an experienced ship's captain and distinguished naval officer (''[[Kapitän zur See]]'' – captain at sea), who after [[World War II]] worked as an inspector at the [[Neptun Werft]] shipbuilding company. Both parents were members of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP).<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/deutschland-das-geheimnis-um-den-onkel_aid_524185.html|title=Das Geheimnis um den Onkel|magazine=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus Online]]|date=2010-06-28}}</ref> Following the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet occupation]] at the end of World War II, the communists were installed into power in what became the German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]). When Joachim Gauck was eleven years old, in 1951, his father was arrested by Soviet occupation forces; he was not to return until 1955.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aspekte.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/12/0,1872,7913004,00.html|title=Der Herr der Akten erzählt sein Leben|work=[[ZDF]]|date=16 October 2009|access-date=30 June 2010|language=de}}</ref> He was convicted by a Russian military tribunal of espionage for receiving a letter from the West and also of anti-Soviet demagogy for being in the possession of a western journal on naval affairs, and deported to a [[Gulag]] in [[Siberia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20120220-40853.html |title=Profile: Joachim Gauck, Germany's 'President of Hearts' – The Local |publisher=Thelocal.de |date= 20 February 2012|access-date=20 March 2012}}</ref> where he was mistreated to the extent that he was considered [[Physical disability|physically disabled]] after one year, according to his son.<ref>Gauck 2009, p. 37</ref> For nearly three years, the family knew nothing about what had happened to him and whether he was still alive. He was freed in 1955, following the state visit of [[Konrad Adenauer]] to Moscow. Adenauer negotiated the release of thousands of German prisoners of war and civilians who had been deported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.de/webarticle/webarticle.jsp?aid=19360|title=Joachim Gauck – Oppositionskandidat für das Amt des Bundespräsidenten|first=Jan|last=Witt|work=randomhouse.de|access-date=30 June 2010|language=de}}</ref>

Gauck graduated with an [[Abitur]] from Innerstädtisches Gymnasium in [[Rostock]]. According to Gauck, his political activities were inspired by the ordeal of his father,<ref>„Wir Deutsche können Freiheit", Interview, Ostseezeitung Rostock, 23/24 January 2010</ref> and he stated that he grew up with a "well-founded anti-communism".<ref>Eckhard Jesse, Eine Revolution und ihre Folgen: 14 Bürgerrechtler ziehen Bilanz, 2000</ref> Already in school in East Germany, he made no secret of his anti-communist position, and he steadfastly refused to join the communist youth movement, the [[Free German Youth]]. He wanted to study German and become a journalist, but because he wasn't a communist, he wasn't allowed to do so.<ref name="thelocalhearts"/> Instead he chose to study [[theology]] and become a pastor in the Protestant church in Mecklenburg. He has stated that his primary intention was not to become a pastor, but the theology studies offered an opportunity to study [[philosophy]] and the church was one of the few institutions in East Germany where communist ideology was not dominant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otz.de/startseite/detail/-/specific/Joachim-Gauck-Vom-Buergerrechtler-zum-Staatsoberhaupt-1722468051 |title=Joachim Gauck: Vom Bürgerrechtler zum Staatsoberhaupt |publisher=otz.de |date=21 February 2012 |access-date=20 March 2012}}</ref> Nevertheless, he did eventually become a pastor. His work as a pastor in East Germany was very difficult due to the hostility of the communist regime towards the church, and for many years he was under constant observation and was harassed by the [[Stasi]] (the secret police).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/die-welt/kultur/literatur/article5125631/Unbelehrbarer-Antikommunist.html|title=Unbelehrbarer Antikommunist|first=Arnulf|last=Baring|newspaper=[[Die Welt]]|date=8 November 2009|access-date=30 June 2010|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2010/04/L-P-Gauck|title=Joachim Gauck: Eine Freiheitslehre|first=Alexander|last=Cammann|work=[[Die Zeit]]|date=24 January 2010|access-date=30 June 2010|language=de}}</ref> The Stasi described Gauck in their file on him as an "incorrigible anti-communist" ("unverbesserlicher Antikommunist").<ref>{{cite web|author=Nachrichten |url=http://news.de.msn.com/politik/politik.aspx?cp-documentid=153650764 |title=Joachim Gauck – eine patriotische Ich-AG |work=News.de.msn.com |access-date=30 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> He has said that "at the age of nine, I knew [[Real socialism|socialism]] was an unjust system."<ref name="thelocalhearts"/>

==Career during and after the Peaceful Revolution of 1989==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-1218-302, Joachim Gauck.jpg|180px|thumb|Joachim Gauck (1990)]]
During the [[Peaceful Revolution]] of 1989, he became a member of the [[New Forum]], a democratic opposition movement, and was elected as its spokesman. He also took part in major demonstrations against the communist regime of GDR. In the [[1990 East German general election|free elections on 18 March 1990]], he was elected to the [[People's Chamber]] of the GDR, representing the [[Alliance 90]] (that consisted of the New Forum, [[Democracy Now (East Germany)|Democracy Now]] and the [[Initiative for Peace and Human Rights]]), where he served until the dissolution of the GDR in October 1990.

On 2 October 1990, the day before the dissolution of the GDR, the People's Chamber elected him Special Representative for the Stasi Records. After the dissolution of the GDR the following day, he was appointed Special Representative of the Federal Government for the Stasi Records by President [[Richard von Weizsäcker]] and Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. As such, he was in charge of the archives of the Stasi and tasked with investigating communist crimes. In 1992, his office became known as the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records. He served in this position until 2000, when he was succeeded by [[Marianne Birthler]].

Gauck served as a member of the [[Bundestag]], the Parliament of Germany, from 3 to 4 October 1990 (the 1990 People's Chamber was granted the right to nominate a certain number of MPs as part of the reunification process). He stepped down following his appointment as Special Representative of the Federal Government. As such, he was the shortest serving Member of Parliament of Germany ever.

He refused the position of President of the [[Federal Agency for Civic Education]] as well as offers to be nominated as a candidate for parliament by the SPD. Voices inside the CSU proposed him as a possible conservative presidential candidate (against SPD career politician [[Johannes Rau]]) in 1999,<ref name="taz">{{cite news|url=http://www.taz.de/1/politik/deutschland/artikel/1/ich-kann-zaehlen/|title=Bundespräsidenten-Kandidat Gauck: "Ich kann zählen"|work=[[Die Tageszeitung|taz]]|date=5 June 2010|access-date=30 June 2010|last1=Lohre|first1=M.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426152235/http://taz.de/1/politik/deutschland/artikel/1/ich-kann-zaehlen/|archive-date=26 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> and his name was also mentioned as a possible candidate for CDU/CSU and Free Democratic Party in subsequent years. For instance the Saxon FDP state party proposed him as a liberal-conservative candidate in 2004, before the leaders of the parties agreed on [[Horst Köhler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/fdp-politiker-zastrow-joachim-gauck-ist-ein-liberaler-wie-wir-1.955188|title=FDP-Politiker Zastrow – "Gauck ist ein Liberaler wie wir"|first=Oliver|last=Das Gupta|work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|date=8 June 2010|access-date=30 June 2010|language=de}}</ref>

Since 2003, he has been chairman of the association [[Gegen Vergessen – Für Demokratie]] ("Against Forgetting – For Democracy"), and he served on the Management Board of the [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] 2001–2004.<ref>[http://www.rpo.gov.pl/pliki/12785936230.pdf Commemoration of the 20th Anniversary of the Commissioner for Civil Rights Protection in Poland], [[Government of Poland]], 2008</ref>

In an interview with [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] in 2007, Gauck said that "we have to delegitimatize [the communist era] not only because of the many victims and criminal acts, but [also because] modern politics in the entire Soviet empire was basically taken backward."<ref name="rfe-rl"/> According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', he "has dedicated his life to showing that the Soviet system's evils were no less than the Third Reich's."<ref name="wsj"/> In his 2012 book ''[[Freedom.
