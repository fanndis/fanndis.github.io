'''Robert Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KG|MC|PC}} (12&nbsp;June 1897&nbsp;– 14 January 1977), was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician who served three periods as [[Foreign Secretary]] and then a relatively brief term as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1955 to 1957.

Achieving rapid promotion as a young Member of Parliament, he became Foreign Secretary aged 38, before resigning in protest at [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement policy]] towards [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s Italy.<ref>Robert Mallett, "The Anglo‐Italian war trade negotiations, contraband control and the failure to appease Mussolini, 1939–40." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 8.1 (1997): 137–167.</ref><ref name=wc1>{{harvnb|Churchill|1948}}</ref> He again held that position for most of the [[Second World War]], and a third time in the early 1950s. Having been deputy to [[Winston Churchill]] for almost 15 years, he succeeded him as the [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|leader of the Conservative Party]] and prime minister in April 1955, and a month later [[1955 United Kingdom general election|won a general election]].

Eden's worldwide reputation as an opponent of appeasement, a "man of peace", and a skilled diplomat was overshadowed in 1956 when the United States refused to support the Anglo-French military response to the [[Suez Crisis]], which critics across party lines regarded as a historic setback for [[British foreign policy]], signalling the end of British predominance in the Middle East.<ref name="Dutton">David Dutton: ''Anthony Eden. A Life and Reputation'' (London, Arnold, 1997).</ref> Most historians argue that he made a series of blunders, especially not realising the depth of American opposition to military action.<ref>Tony Shaw, ''Eden, Suez & the Mass Media: Propaganda & Persuasion during the Suez Crisis'' (1996).</ref> Two months after ordering an end to the [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Suez operation]], he resigned as prime minister on grounds of ill health and because he was widely suspected of having misled the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] over the degree of collusion with France and Israel.<ref>{{cite book|author=Keith Layborn|title=Fifty Key Figures in Twentieth Century British Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GgGDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA102|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|page=102|isbn=9781134588749|access-date=8 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207015831/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgGDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA102|archive-date=7 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

R. Thorpe (2003) ''Eden''.</ref> Biographer [[D. R. Thorpe]] described the Suez Crisis as "a truly tragic end to his premiership, and one that came to assume a disproportionate importance in any assessment of his career."<ref name=Thorpe2003>Thorpe (2003) ''Eden''.</ref>

==Family==
Eden was born on 12 June 1897 at [[Windlestone Hall]], County Durham, into a conservative family of [[landed gentry]]. He was the third of four sons of [[Sir William Eden, 7th Baronet|Sir William Eden, 7th and 5th Baronet]], a former colonel and local [[magistrate]] from an [[Eden baronets|old titled family]]. Sir William, an eccentric and often foul-tempered man, was a talented watercolourist, portraitist and collector of [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].<ref>Aster 1976, p. 2.</ref><ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp 9–14">Rhodes James 1986, pp. 9–14.</ref>

Eden's mother, Sybil Frances Grey, was a member of the prominent [[Earl Grey|Grey family]] of [[Northumberland]]. She had wanted to marry [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Francis Knollys]], who later became a significant Royal adviser, but the match was forbidden by [[Edward VII|the Prince of Wales]].<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 10.</ref> Although she was a popular figure locally, she had a strained relationship with her children, and her profligacy ruined the family fortunes.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp 9–14"/> Eden's elder brother Tim had to sell Windlestone in 1936.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 6.</ref> [[Rab Butler]] would later quip that Eden—a handsome but ill-tempered man—was "half mad baronet, half beautiful woman".<ref name=Thorpe2003/><ref>John Charmley (1989) ''Chamberlain and the Lost Peace''.</ref>

Eden's great-grandfather was William Iremonger, who commanded the [[2nd Regiment of Foot]] during the [[Peninsular War]] and fought under [[Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] (as he became) at [[Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeiro]].<ref>''Antiques Trade Gazette'', 26 November 2011, p. 45.</ref> He was also descended from Governor [[Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland]] and, through the Calvert Family of Maryland, he was connected to the ancient [[Roman Catholic]] aristocracy of the [[Baron Arundell of Wardour|Arundell]] and [[House of Howard|Howard]] families, some of whom were Roman Catholics like the Dukes of Norfolk and others Anglican such as the earls of Carlisle, Effingham and Suffolk. The Calverts had converted to the Established Church early in the 18th century to regain the proprietorship of Maryland. He was also descendant from the Schaffalitzky de Muckadell family of [[Denmark]], and Bie family of [[Norway]].<ref>Ole Feldbæk, Ole Justesen, Svend Ellehøj, Kolonierne i Asien og Afrika, 1980, p. 171.</ref> Eden was once amused to learn that one of his ancestors had, like Churchill's ancestor [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|the Duke of Marlborough]], been the lover of [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Castlemaine]].<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 3.</ref>

There was speculation for many years that Eden's biological father was the politician and man of letters [[George Wyndham]], but this is considered impossible as Wyndham was in South Africa at the time of Eden's conception.<ref>D. R. Thorpe, ''Eden'', (Robert) Anthony, first earl of Avon (1897–1977)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2011.</ref> Eden's mother was rumoured to have had an affair with Wyndham.<ref name=Thorpe2003/> His mother and Wyndham exchanged affectionate communications in 1896 but Wyndham was an infrequent visitor to Windlesham and probably did not reciprocate Sybil's feelings. Eden was amused by the rumours but, according to his biographer Rhodes James, probably did not believe them. He did not resemble his siblings, but his father Sir William attributed this to his being "a Grey, not an Eden".<ref>Rhodes James 1986, pp. 16–18.</ref>

Eden had an elder brother, John, who was killed in action in 1914,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/488339 |title = Casualty Details|publisher=CWGC |year=1914|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> and a younger brother, Nicholas, who was killed when the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|6}} blew up and sank at the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2865847 |title = Casualty Details|publisher=CWGC |year=1916|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref>

==Early life==
===School===
Eden was educated at two independent schools. He attended [[Sandroyd School]] in [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]] from 1907 to 1910, where he excelled in languages.<ref>Thorpe (2003), pp. 48–49.</ref> He then started at [[Eton College]] in January 1911.<ref>Aster 1976, p. 4.</ref> There, he won a [[Divinity (academic discipline)|Divinity]] prize and excelled at cricket, rugby and rowing, winning House [[colours, standards and guidons|colours]] in the last.<ref>Alan Campbell-Johanson, ''Eden: The Making of a Statesman'', Read Books, 2007, p. 9 {{ISBN|978-1-4067-6451-2}}</ref>

Eden learned French and German on continental holidays and, as a child, is said to have spoken French better than English.<ref>Aster 1976, p. 3.</ref> Although Eden was able to converse with Hitler in German in February 1934 and with Chinese Premier [[Chou En-lai]] in French at Geneva in 1954, he preferred, out of a sense of professionalism, to have interpreters to translate at formal meetings.<ref>Thorpe 2003, p. 46.</ref><ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 136.</ref>

Although Eden later claimed to have had no interest in politics until the early 1920s, his teenage letters and diaries show him to have been obsessed with the subject. He was a strong, partisan Conservative by rejoicing in the defeat of [[Charles Masterman]] at a by-election in May 1913 and once astonishing his mother on a train journey by telling her the MP and the size of his majority for each constituency through which they passed.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 26.</ref> By 1914 he was a member of the Eton Society ("Pop").<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 27. ("Pop" is a self-selecting social club of senior Eton boys, who are permitted to wear coloured waistcoats.)</ref>

===First World War===
During the [[First World War]], Eden's elder brother, Lieutenant John Eden, was killed in action on 17 October 1914, at the age of 26, while serving with the [[12th Royal Lancers|12th (Prince of Wales's Royal) Lancers]]. He is buried in [[Larch Wood (Railway Cutting) Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery]] in Belgium.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/488339/eden,-john/ |title=Casualty |access-date=14 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215001305/https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/488339/eden,-john/ |archive-date=15 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> His uncle Robin was later shot down and captured whilst serving with the [[Royal Flying Corps]].<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8">Aster 1976, pp. 5–8.</ref>

Volunteering for service in the [[British Army]], like many others of his generation, Eden served with the 21st (Yeoman Rifles) Battalion of the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] (KRRC), a [[Kitchener's Army]] unit, initially recruited mainly from [[County Durham]] country labourers, who were increasingly replaced by Londoners after losses at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] in mid-1916.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/> He was commissioned as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 2 November 1915 (antedated to 29 September 1915).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29376 |supp=y|page=11579|date=19 November 1915}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29426 |supp=y|page=124|date=31 December 1915}}</ref> His battalion transferred to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] on 4 May 1916 as part of the [[41st Division (United Kingdom)|41st Division]].<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/> On 31 May 1916, Eden's younger brother, Midshipman William Nicholas Eden, was killed in action, aged 16, on board {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|6}} during the [[Battle of Jutland]]. He is commemorated on the [[Plymouth Naval Memorial]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2865847/eden,-william-nicholas/ |title=Casualty |access-date=14 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215001415/https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2865847/eden,-william-nicholas/ |archive-date=15 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> His brother-in-law, Lord Brooke, was wounded during the war.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8" />

One summer night in 1916, near [[Ploegsteert]], Eden had to lead a small raid into an enemy trench to kill or capture enemy soldiers to identify the enemy units opposite. He and his men were pinned down in [[no man's land]] under enemy fire, his sergeant seriously wounded in the leg. Eden sent one man back to British lines to fetch another man and a stretcher, and he and three others carried the wounded sergeant back with, as he later put it in his memoirs, a "chilly feeling down our spines", unsure whether the Germans had not seen them in the dark or were chivalrously declining to fire. He omitted to mention that he had been awarded the [[Military Cross]] (MC) for the incident, which he had made little mention in his political career.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, pp. 43–44.</ref> On 18 September 1916, after the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]] (part of the [[Battle of the Somme]]), he wrote to his mother, "I have seen things lately that I am not likely to forget".<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/> On 3 October, he was appointed an [[Adjutant#Military and paramilitary appointment#Britain and the Commonwealth|adjutant]], with the rank of temporary [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] for the duration of that appointment.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29911|page=823|date=19 January 1917}}</ref> At the age of 19, he was the youngest adjutant on the Western Front.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/>

Eden's MC was gazetted in the [[1917 Birthday Honours]] list.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30111 |date=1 June 1917 |page=5478 |supp=y}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=13099 |date=4 June 1917 |page=1070 |city=e}}</ref> His battalion fought at [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines Ridge]] in June 1917.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/> On 1 July 1917, Eden was confirmed as a temporary lieutenant,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30333 |supp=y|page=10558|date=12 October 1917}}</ref> relinquishing his appointment as adjutant three days later.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30487 |supp=y|page=1081|date=18 January 1918}}</ref> His battalion fought in the first few days of [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Battle of Ypres]] (31 July – 4 August).<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/> Between 20 and 23 September 1917 his battalion spent a few days on coastal defence on the Franco-Belgian border.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/>

On 19 November, Eden was transferred to the General Staff as a [[Staff (military)|General Staff Officer Grade 3]] (GSO3), with the temporary rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30452 |supp=y|page=101|date=28 December 1917}}</ref> He served at [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] HQ between mid-November 1917 and 8 March 1918, missing out on [[Italian Expeditionary Force|service in Italy]] (as the 41st Division had been transferred [[Italian Front (World War I)|there]] after the [[Second Army (Italy)|Italian Second Army]] was defeated at the [[Battle of Caporetto]]). Eden returned to the Western Front as a [[Operation Michael|major German offensive]] was clearly imminent, only for his former battalion to be disbanded to help alleviate the British Army's acute manpower shortage.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/> Although [[David Lloyd George]], then the [[British prime minister]], was one of the few politicians of whom Eden reported frontline soldiers speaking highly, he wrote to his sister (23 December 1917) in disgust at his "wait and see twaddle" in declining to extend [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|conscription to Ireland]].<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p.52">Rhodes James 1986, p. 52.</ref>

In March 1918, during the German [[Spring Offensive]], he was stationed near [[La Fère]] on the [[Oise (river)|Oise]], opposite [[Adolf Hitler]], as he learned at a conference in 1935.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/><ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p.55">Rhodes James 1986, p. 55.</ref> At one point, when brigade HQ was bombed by German aircraft, his companion told him, "There now, you have had your first taste of the next war."<ref>Aster 1976, pp. 20–21.</ref> On 26 May 1918, he was appointed [[brigade major]] of the [[198th (East Lancashire) Brigade|198th Infantry Brigade]], part of the [[66th Division (United Kingdom)|66th Division]].<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/><ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p.52"/> At the age of 20, Eden was the youngest brigade major in the British Army.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p.55"/>

He considered standing for Parliament at the end of the war, but the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|general election]] was called too early for that to be possible.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p.55"/> After the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice with Germany]], he spent the winter of 1918–1919 in the Ardennes with his brigade; on 28 March 1919, he transferred to be brigade major of the [[99th Brigade (United Kingdom)|99th Infantry Brigade]].<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/> Eden contemplated applying for a commission in the Regular Army, but it was very hard to come by with the army contracting so rapidly. He initially shrugged off his mother's suggestion of studying at Oxford. He also rejected the thought of becoming a [[barrister]]. His preferred career alternatives at this stage were standing for Parliament for Bishop Auckland, the Civil Service in East Africa or the Foreign Office.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, pp. 56–58.</ref> He was demobilised on 13 June 1919.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 5–8"/> He retained the rank of captain.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31479 |supp=y|page=9661|date=29 July 1919}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=32034 |supp=y|page=8846|date=27 August 1920}}</ref>

Eden had dabbled in the study of Turkish with a family friend.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 8–9">Aster 1976, pp. 8–9.</ref> After the war, he studied [[Oriental Languages]] ([[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]) at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], starting in October 1919.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp. 59–62">Rhodes James 1986, pp. 59–62.</ref> Persian was his main and Arabic his secondary language. He studied under Richard Paset Dewhurst and [[David Samuel Margoliouth]].<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 8–9"/>

At Oxford, Eden took no part in student politics, and his main leisure interest at the time was art.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp. 59–62"/> Eden was in the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] and President of the Asiatic Society. Along with [[Lord David Cecil]] and [[Robert Gathorne-Hardy|R. E. Gathorne-Hardy]] he founded the Uffizi Society, of which he later became President. Possibly under the influence of his father he gave a paper on [[Paul Cézanne]], whose work was not yet widely appreciated.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 8–9"/> Eden was already collecting paintings.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp. 59–62"/>

In July 1920, still an undergraduate, Eden was recalled to military service as a lieutenant in the 6th Battalion of the [[Durham Light Infantry]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=32030 |supp=y|page=8779|date=24 August 1920}}</ref> In the spring of 1921, once again as a temporary captain, he commanded local defence forces at [[Spennymoor]] as [[Triple Alliance (1914)#The Post-War Triple Alliance|serious industrial unrest]] seemed possible.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p.62">Rhodes James 1986, p. 62.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=32320 |supp=y|page=3821|date=10 May 1921}}</ref> He again relinquished his commission on 8 July.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=32439 |supp=y|page=6832|date=29 August 1921}}</ref> He graduated from Oxford in June 1922 with a [[Double First]].<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp. 59–62"/> He continued to serve as an officer in the Territorial Army until May 1923.<ref>Aster 1976, p. 9.</ref>

==Early political career, 1922–1931==

===1922–1924===
Captain Eden, as he was still known, was selected to contest [[Spennymoor (UK Parliament constituency)|Spennymoor]], as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. At first, he had hoped to win with some Liberal support as the Conservatives were still supporting Lloyd George's coalition government, but by the time of the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|November 1922 general election]], it was clear that the surge in the Labour vote made that unlikely.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, pp. 63–64.</ref> His main sponsor was the [[Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]], a local coalowner. The seat went from Liberal to Labour.<ref>Aster 1976, p. 10.</ref>

Eden's father had died on 20 February 1915.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 32.</ref> As a younger son, he had inherited capital of £7,675 and in 1922 he had a private income of £706 after tax (approximately £375,000 and £35,000 at 2014 prices).<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p.62"/><ref name="measuringworth.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php|title=Measuring Worth – Measures of worth, inflation rates, saving calculator, relative value, worth of a dollar, worth of a pound, purchasing power, gold prices, GDP, history of wages, average wage|website=www.measuringworth.com|access-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331194822/https://measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php|archive-date=31 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Eden read the writings of [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] and was hoping to emulate him by entering politics with a view to specialising in foreign affairs.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 622.</ref> Eden married [[Beatrice Beckett]] in the autumn of 1923, and after a two-day honeymoon in Essex, he was selected to fight [[Warwick and Leamington (UK Parliament constituency)|Warwick and Leamington]] for a by-election in November 1923. His Labour opponent, [[Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick|Daisy Greville]], Countess of Warwick, was by coincidence his sister Elfrida's mother-in-law and also mother to his wife's step-mother, Marjorie Blanche Eve Beckett, née Greville.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52294243|title=ADONIS OF BRITISH POLITICS|date=18 February 1939|work=The Examiner|location=Launceston, Tasmania|accessdate=1 September 2017|page=1}}</ref> On 16 November 1923, during the by-election campaign, Parliament was dissolved for the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|December 1923 general election]].<ref>Aster 1976, p. 11.</ref> He was elected to Parliament at the age of twenty-six.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp 78–9">Rhodes James 1986, pp. 78–79.</ref>

The first Labour Government, under [[Ramsay MacDonald]], took office in January 1924. Eden's [[maiden speech]] (19 February 1924) was a controversial attack on Labour's defence policy and was heckled, and he was thereafter careful to speak only after deep preparation.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp 78–9"/> He later reprinted the speech in the collection ''Foreign Affairs'' (1939) to give an impression that he had been a consistent advocate of air strength. Eden admired [[H. H. Asquith]], then in his final year in the Commons, for his lucidity and brevity. On 1 April 1924, he spoke to urge Anglo-Turkish friendship and the ratification of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], which had been signed in July 1923.<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 12–13">Aster 1976, pp. 12–13.</ref>

===1924–1929===
The Conservatives returned to power at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 General Election]]. In January 1925, Eden, disappointed not to have been offered a position, went on a tour of the [[Middle East]] and met [[Faisal I of Iraq|Emir Feisal of Iraq]]. Feisal reminded him of the "[[Nicholas II of Russia|Czar of Russia]] & (I) suspect that his fate may be similar" (a similar fate indeed befell the Iraqi Royal Family [[14 July Revolution|in 1958]]). He inspected the oil refinery at Abadan, which he likened to "a [[Swansea]] on a small scale".<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp 84–6">Rhodes James 1986, pp. 84–86.</ref>

He was appointed [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Godfrey Locker-Lampson]], Under-Secretary at the Home Office (17 February 1925), serving under Home Secretary [[William Joynson Hicks]].<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p85">Rhodes James 1986, p. 85.</ref>

In July 1925, he went on a second trip to Canada, Australia and India.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp 84–6"/> He wrote articles for ''[[The Yorkshire Post]]'', controlled by his father-in-law Sir [[Gervase Beckett]], under the pseudonym "Backbencher".<ref name="Aster 1976, pp. 12–13"/> In September 1925, he represented the ''Yorkshire Post'' at the Imperial Conference at [[Melbourne]].<ref>Aster 1976, p. 14.</ref>

Eden continued to be PPS to Locker-Lampson when the latter was appointed Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office in December 1925.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p85"/> He distinguished himself with a speech on the Middle East (21 December 1925),<ref>Rhodes James 1986, pp. 87–89.</ref> that called for the readjustment of Iraqi frontiers in favour of Turkey but also for a continued [[Mandatory Iraq|British mandate]], rather than a "scuttle". Eden ended his speech by calling for Anglo-Turkish friendship. On 23 March 1926, he spoke to urge the [[League of Nations]] to admit Germany, which would happen the following year.<ref>Aster 1976, p. 15.</ref> In July 1926 he became PPS to the Foreign Secretary Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]].<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 91.</ref>

Besides supplementing his parliamentary income of around £300 a year at that time by writing and journalism, he published a book about his travels, ''Places in the Sun'' in 1926 that was highly critical of the detrimental effect of socialism on Australia and to which [[Stanley Baldwin]] wrote a foreword.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p103">Rhodes James 1986, p. 103.</ref>

In November 1928, with Austen Chamberlain away on a voyage to recover his health, Eden had to speak for the government in a debate on a recent Anglo-French naval agreement in reply to Ramsay MacDonald, then Leader of the Opposition.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 92.</ref> According to Austen Chamberlain, he would have been promoted to his first ministerial job, Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, if the Conservatives had won the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 election]].<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p101">Rhodes James 1986, p. 101.</ref>

===1929–1931===
The 1929 general election was the only time that Eden received less than 50% of the vote at Warwick.<ref>Aster 1976, p. 19.</ref> After the Conservative defeat, he joined a progressive group of younger politicians consisting of [[Oliver Stanley]], [[William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech|William Ormsby-Gore]] and the future [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] [[William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil|W.S. "Shakes" Morrison]]. Another member was [[Noel Skelton]], who had before his death coined the phrase "property-owning democracy", which Eden was later to popularise as a Conservative Party aspiration. Eden advocated co-partnership in industry between managers and workers, whom he wanted to be given [[share (finance)|shares]].<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p101"/>

In opposition between 1929 and 1931, Eden worked as a City broker for Harry Lucas, a firm that was eventually absorbed into [[S. G. Warburg & Co.]]<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p103"/>

==Foreign Affairs Minister, 1931–1935==
In August 1931, Eden held his first ministerial office as [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Under-Secretary]] for [[foreign policy|Foreign Affairs]] in Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]]. Initially, the office was held by [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Lord Reading]] (in the House of Lords), but [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] held the position from November 1931.

Like many of his generation who had served in the First World War, Eden was strongly [[antiwar]], and he strove to work through the [[League of Nations]] to preserve European peace. The government proposed [[World Disarmament Conference|measures]] superseding the postwar [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Treaty]] to allow Germany to rearm (albeit replacing its [[Reichswehr|small professional army]] with a short-service militia) and to reduce French armaments. [[Winston Churchill]] criticised the policy sharply in the House of Commons on 23 March 1933, opposing "undue" French disarmament as this might require Britain to take action to enforce peace under the 1925 [[Locarno Treaties|Locarno Treaty]].<ref name=wc1/><ref>This was the speech in which Churchill declared "Thank God for the French Army" and in which he stated that Ramsay MacDonald had "more than any other man, the gift of compressing the largest number of words into the smallest amount of thought". Although Churchill compared Eden's planned trip to see Mussolini to the [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]]'s trip to [[Canossa]], they had a friendly drink afterwards. [Rhodes James 1986, pp. 126–7]</ref> Eden, replying for the government, dismissed Churchill's speech as exaggerated and unconstructive and commented that land disarmament had yet to make the same progress as naval disarmament at the [[Washington Naval Conference|Washington]] and [[London Naval Treaty|London]] Treaties and arguing that French disarmament was needed to "secure for Europe that period of appeasement which is needed".<ref>{{cite book|title=Hansard|date=23 March 1933}}</ref><ref>Rhodes James 1986, pp. 126–127.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Manchester|first=William|title=The last lion, Winston Spencer Churchill vol. 2.

[[Neville Chamberlain]] commented shortly afterwards, "That young man is coming along rapidly; not only can he make a good speech but he has a good head and what advice he gives is listened to by the Cabinet".<ref>Thorpe 1997, p. 29.</ref> Eden later wrote that in the early 1930s, the word "appeasement" was still used in its correct sense (from the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'') of seeking to settle strife. Only later in the decade would it come to acquire a pejorative meaning of acceding to bullying demands.<ref name=wc1/><ref>Thorpe 2003, p. 55.</ref>

He was appointed [[Lord Privy Seal]] in December 1933,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34014 |date=12 January 1934 |page=311}}</ref> a position that was combined with the newly created office of Minister for League of Nations Affairs.

He entered the cabinet for the first time when [[Stanley Baldwin]] formed his third administration in June 1935. Eden later came to recognise that peace could not be maintained by appeasement of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]]. He privately opposed the policy of the Foreign Secretary, Sir [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]], of trying to appease Italy during its [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invasion of Abyssinia]] (now called [[Ethiopia]]) in 1935. After Hoare resigned after the failure of the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]], Eden succeeded him as Foreign Secretary. When Eden had his first audience with [[King George&nbsp;V]], the King is said to have remarked, "No more coals to Newcastle, no more Hoares to Paris".

In 1935, Baldwin sent Eden on a two-day visit to see Hitler, with whom he dined twice.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|page=288}}</ref> Litvinov's biographer John Holroyd-Doveton believed that Eden shares with Molotov the experience of being the only people to have had dinner with Hitler, Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin although not on the same occasion. Hitler never had dinner with any of the other three leaders, and as far as is known, Stalin never saw Hitler.

Attlee was convinced that public opinion could stop Hitler, saying in a speech in the House of Commons: 

"We believe in a League system in which the whole world would be ranged against an aggressor. If it is shown that someone is proposing to break the peace let us bring the whole world opinion against her".<ref>{{Cite journal|date=11 March 1935|title=Hansard|volume=299|page=40}}</ref>

However, Eden was more realistic and correctly predicted: 

"Hitler could only be stopped. There may be the only course of action open to us to join with those powers who are members of the League in affirming our faith in that institution and to uphold the principles of the Covenant. It may be the spectacle of the great powers of the League reaffirming their intentions to collaborate more closely than ever is not only the sole means of bringing home to Germany that the inevitable effect of persisting in her present policy will be to consolidate against her all those nations which believe in collective security but will also tend to give confidence to those less powerful nations which through fear of Germany’s growing strength might well otherwise be drawn into her orbit".<ref name="auto">{{Cite book|title=Memoirs, Facing the Dictators|last=Eden|first=Anthony|page=157}}</ref>

Eden proceeded to Moscow for talks with Stalin and Soviet Minister Litvinov,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|page=289}}</ref> Most of the British cabinet feared of the spread of Bolshevism to Britain and hated the Soviets, but Eden went with an open mind and had a respect for Stalin:

"(Stalin’s) personality made itself felt without exaggeration. He had natural good manners, perhaps a Georgian inheritance. Though I knew the man was without mercy, I respected the quality of his mind and even felt a sympathy I have never been able to analyse. Perhaps it was because of the pragmatic approach. I cannot believe he had any affinity to Marx. Certainly no one could have been less doctrinaire".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memoirs, Facing The Dictators|last=Eden|first=Anthony}}</ref>

Eden felt sure most of his colleagues would feel unenthusiastic about any favourable report on the Soviet Union but felt certain to be correct.

The representatives of both governments were happy to note that as a result of a full and frank exchange of views, there is at present no conflict of interest between them on any of the major issues of international policy, which provided a firm foundation between them in the cause of peace.

Eden stated when he sent the communiqué to his government, he thought that his colleagues would be "Unenthusiastic, I am sure".<ref name="auto"/>

John Holroyd-Doveton argued that Eden would proved right. Not only was the French army defeated by the Germany army, but France broke its treaty with Britain by seeking an armistice with Germany. In contrast, the Red Army finally defeated the German Army.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publication|year=2013|page=367}}</ref>

At that stage in his career, Eden was considered as something of a leader of fashion. He regularly wore a [[Homburg (hat)|Homburg]] hat, which became known in Britain as an "[[Anthony Eden hat|Anthony Eden]]".

==Foreign Secretary and resignation, 1935–1938==
[[File:Léon Blum, Anthony Eden, 1936.jpg|thumb|170px|Eden with French Prime Minister [[Léon Blum]] in Geneva in 1936]]
Eden became Foreign Secretary while Britain had to adjust its [[foreign policy]] to face the rise of the fascist powers. He supported the policy of non-interference in the [[Spanish Civil War]] through conferences such as the [[Nyon Conference]] and supported Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] in his efforts to preserve peace through reasonable concessions to Germany. The [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian-Ethiopian War]] was brewing, and Eden tried in vain to persuade Mussolini to submit the dispute to the League of Nations. The Italian dictator scoffed at Eden publicly as "the best dressed fool in Europe". Eden did not protest when Britain and France failed to oppose Hitler's [[remilitarisation of the Rhineland|reoccupation of the Rhineland]] in 1936. When the French requested a meeting with a view to some kind of military action in response to Hitler's occupation, Eden's statement firmly ruled out any military assistance to France.<ref>W.N. Medlicott et al., Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919–39, XVI(H.M.S.O.), pp. 60–66.</ref>

Growing dissatisfaction with Chamberlain's policy of coming to friendly terms with Italy led to his resignation on 20 February 1938 as a public protest. Eden used secret intelligence reports to conclude Italy was an enemy.<ref>H. Matthew Hefler, "'In the way': intelligence, Eden, and British foreign policy towards Italy, 1937–38." ''Intelligence and National Security'' (2018): 1–19.</ref>

Eden still had no complaints about the appeasement of Nazi Germany. He became a Conservative dissenter, leading a group that Conservative whip [[David Margesson]] called the "Glamour Boys". Meanwhile, the leading anti-appeaser [[Winston Churchill]] led a similar group, "The Old Guard".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95077.html |title=Oxford DNB theme: Glamour boys |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |accessdate=15 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606080851/http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95077.html |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> They were not yet allies and would not see eye-to-eye until Churchill became prime minister in 1940. There was much speculation that Eden would become a rallying point for all the disparate opponents of Chamberlain, but Eden's position declined heavily among politicians since he maintained a low profile and avoided confrontation though he opposed the [[Munich Agreement]] and abstained in the vote on it in the House of Commons. However, he remained popular in the country at large and, in later years, was often wrongly supposed to have resigned as Foreign Secretary in protest at the Munich Agreement and appeasement generally. In a 1967 interview, Eden explained his decision to resign: "we had an agreement with Mussolini about the Mediterranean and Spain, which he was violating by sending troops to Spain, and Chamberlain wanted to have another agreement. I thought Mussolini should honour the first one before we negotiated for the second. I was trying to fight a delaying action for Britain, and I could not go along with Chamberlain's policy".<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news |first=Alden |last=Whitman |date=15 January 1977 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0612.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Career Built on Style and Dash Ended with Invasion of Egypt |access-date=5 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626083842/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0612.html |archive-date=26 June 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the last months of peace in 1939, Eden joined the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] with the rank of major, in the London Rangers motorised battalion of the King's Royal Rifle Corps and was at annual camp with them in [[Beaulieu, Hampshire]], when he heard news of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]].<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Volume 17, p. 669.</ref>

On the outbreak of war, on 3 September 1939, Eden, unlike most Territorials, did not mobilise for active service. Instead, he returned to Chamberlain's government as [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] and he visited [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] in February 1940 to inspect the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Glennie |first1=Reg |title=Anthony Eden ls Heart Throb To 'Aussie' Nurses In Palestine |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/58967996 |accessdate=7 March 2020 |work=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]] |date=18 February 1940 |location=Perth |page=1}}</ref> However, he was not in the [[War Cabinet]].

At the end of 1940, Eden returned to the [[Foreign Office]] and became a member of the executive committee of the [[Political Warfare Executive]] in 1941. Although he was one of Churchill's closest confidants, his role in wartime was restricted because Churchill conducted himself the most important negotiations, with [[Franklin D.

Nevertheless, he was in charge of handling most of the relations between Britain and the [[Free French]] leader, [[Charles de Gaulle]], during the last years of the war. Eden was often both critical of the emphasis Churchill put on the [[special relationship]] with the United States and disappointed by the American treatment of its British allies.<ref name="Dutton" />

In 1942, Eden was given the additional role of [[Leader of the House of Commons]]. He was considered for various other major jobs during and after the war, including Commander-in-Chief Middle East in 1942 (which would have been a very unusual appointment as Eden was a civilian; General [[Harold Alexander]] would be appointed), [[Viceroy of India]] in 1943 (General [[Archibald Wavell]] was appointed to this job) or Secretary-General of the newly-formed United Nations Organisation in 1945.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In 1943, with the revelation of the [[Katyn Massacre]], Eden refused to help the [[Polish Government in Exile]].<ref name='Andrews1976'>{{cite book | last = Andrews | first = Allen | title = Exemplary Justice | publisher = Harrap | year = 1976 | location = London | isbn = 978-0-245-52775-3 }}</ref> Eden supported the idea of postwar [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia]].<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EWz5oFDQhaUC&pg=PA113 The Myriad Chronicles]''".

In early 1943, Eden blocked a request from the Bulgarian authorities to aid with deporting part of the [[Jews in Bulgaria|Jewish population]] from newly-acquired Bulgarian territories to British-controlled Palestine. After his refusal, some of the people were transported to [[German concentration camps]] in Nazi-occupied Poland.<ref>A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time by Howard M. Sachar, Alfred A. Knopf, N.Y., 2007.</ref>

In 1944, Eden went to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet Union at the [[Tolstoy Conference]]. Eden also opposed the [[Morgenthau Plan]] to deindustrialise Germany. After the [[Stalag Luft III murders]], he vowed in the House of Commons to bring the perpetrators of the crime to "exemplary justice", which led to a successful manhunt after the war by the [[Royal Air Force]]'s [[Special Investigation Branch]].<ref name="Andrews1976" />

Eden's eldest son, [[Pilot Officer]] Simon Gascoigne Eden, went missing in action and was later declared dead; he was serving as a [[navigator]] with the Royal Air Force in [[Burma]] in June 1945.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2085328 |title=Casualty Details |publisher=CWGC |date=23 June 1945 |accessdate=15 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612184650/https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2085328 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> There was a close bond between Eden and Simon, and Simon's death was a great personal shock to his father.

In 1945, he was mentioned by [[Halvdan Koht]] among seven candidates who were qualified for the [[Nobel Prize in Peace]]. However, he did not explicitly nominate any of them. The person who was actually nominated was [[Cordell Hull]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/nomination.php?action=show&showid=3319 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130904010737/http://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/nomination.php?action=show&showid=3319 | url-status=dead | archive-date = 4 September 2013 | accessdate = 14 May 2010 | title = Record from The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Peace, 1901–1956 | publisher = [[Nobel Foundation]]}}</ref>

==Postwar, 1945–1955==
===In opposition, 1945–1951===
After the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won the 1945 election, Eden went into opposition as [[Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party]]. Many felt that Churchill should have retired and allowed Eden to become party leader, but Churchill refused to consider the idea. As early as the spring of 1946, Eden openly asked Churchill to retire in his favour.<ref>Williams, Charles ''Harold Macmillan'' (2009), p. 183.</ref> He was in any case depressed by the end of his first marriage and the death of his eldest son. Churchill was, in many ways, only "part-time Leader of the Opposition"<ref name="Dutton"/> because of his many journeys abroad and his literary work, and left the day-to-day work largely to Eden, who was largely regarded as lacking sense of party politics and contact with the common man.<ref name="Time-man who waited">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891429,00.html |work=Time |title=Foreign News: Sir Anthony Eden: The Man Who Waited |date=11 April 1955 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121234132/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891429,00.html |archive-date=21 November 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the opposition years, however, he developed some knowledge about domestic affairs and created the idea of a "property-owning-democracy", which [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government attempted to achieve decades later. His domestic agenda is overall considered to be [[centre-left]].<ref name="Dutton"/>

===Return to government, 1951–1955===
In 1951 the Conservatives returned to office and Eden became Foreign Secretary for a third time and, additionally, Deputy Prime Minister,<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anthony-Eden</ref> though he was never officially appointed to the latter office by the King, whose advisers considered that the position did not exist in the UK constitution (Attlee's appointment during the Second World War being an exception) and that it might interfere with the monarch's prerogative to (in principle) freely choose the next prime minister.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brazier|first=Rodney|title=Choosing a Prime Minister: The Transfer of Power in Britain|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2020|pages=72}}</ref> Churchill was largely a figurehead in the government, and Eden had effective control of British foreign policy for the second time, with the decline of the empire and the intensifying of the [[Cold War]].
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-27106-0001, Paris, Verhandlungen über NATO-Beitritt.jpg|thumb|[[London and Paris Conferences|Negotiations in London and Paris]] in 1954 ended the [[Allied-occupied Germany|allied occupation]] of [[West Germany]] and allowed for its rearmament as a NATO member.]]
Eden's biographer Richard Lamb said that Eden bullied Churchill into going back on commitments to European unity made in opposition. The truth appears to be more complex. Britain was still a world power or at least trying to be one in 1945–55, with the concept of sovereignty not as discredited as on the Continent. The United States encouraged moves towards European federalism so that it could withdraw troops and have the Germans rearmed under supervision. Eden was less Atlanticist than Churchill and had little time for European federalism. He wanted firm alliances with France and other Western European powers to contain Germany.<ref>Charmley 1995, pp. 30, 246–249.</ref> Half of British trade was then with the [[sterling area]] and only a quarter with Western Europe. Despite later talk of "lost opportunities", even Macmillan, who had been an active member of the [[European Movementa]] after the war, acknowledged in February 1952 that Britain's relationship with the United States and the Commonwealth would prevent it from joining a federal Europe at the time.<ref name="Charmley 1995, p299">Charmley 1995, p. 299.</ref> Eden was also irritated by Churchill's hankering for a summit meeting with the Soviet Union in 1953 after Stalin's death.<ref name="Charmley 1995, p299"/> Eden became seriously ill from a series of botched bile duct operations in April 1953 that nearly killed him. After that, he had frequent bouts of poor physical health and psychological depression.<ref>{{cite book|author=D. R.

Despite the ending of the [[British Raj]] in India, British interest in the [[Middle East]] remained strong. Britain had treaty relations with [[Jordan]] and [[Iraq]] and was the protecting power for [[Kuwait]] and the [[Trucial States]], the colonial power in [[Aden]], and the occupying power in the [[Suez Canal]]. Many right-wing Conservative MPs, organised in the so-called ''Suez Group'', sought to retain the imperial role, but economic pressures made maintenance of it increasingly difficult. Britain sought to maintain its huge military base in the Suez Canal zone and, in the face of Egyptian resentment, to further develop its alliance with Iraq, and the hope was that the Americans would assist Britain, possibly by finance. While the Americans co-operated with the British in overthrowing the [[Mosaddegh]] government in [[Iran]] after it had nationalised British oil interests, the Americans developed their own relations in the region and took a positive view of the Egyptian [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers]] and developed friendly relations with [[Saudi Arabia]]. Britain was eventually forced to withdraw from the canal zone, and the [[Baghdad Pact]] security treaty was not supported by the United States, which left Eden vulnerable to the charge of having failed to maintain British prestige.<ref>Turner, Suez 1956: The Inside Story of the First Oil War, Hodder & Stoughton, {{ISBN|978-0340837696}}, 2007.</ref>

[[File:1stIndochinaWar003.jpg|thumb|[[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]], 21 July 1954. Last plenary session on [[Indochina]] in the Palais des Nations.]]
Eden had grave misgivings about American foreign policy under Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. As early as March 1953, Eisenhower was concerned at the escalating costs of defence and the increase of state power that it would bring.<ref name="Charmley 1995, pp 274–5">Charmley 1995, pp. 274–275.</ref> Eden was irked by Dulles's policy of "brinkmanship", or display of muscle, in relations with the communist world. In particular, both had heated exchanges with one another regarding the proposed American aerial strike operation ([[Operation Vulture|''Vulture'']]) to try to save the beleaguered French garrison at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in early 1954.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sherwood |first1=Elizabeth D |title=Allies in crisis |date=1990 |publisher=Yale |isbn=9780300041705 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/alliesincrisisme00sher/page/52 52]–53 |url=https://archive.org/details/alliesincrisisme00sher|url-access=registration}}</ref> The operation was cancelled because of Eden's refusal to commit to it for fear of Chinese intervention. Dulles then walked out early in the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] talks and was critical of the American decision not to sign it. Nevertheless, the success of the conference ranked as the outstanding achievement of Eden's third term in the [[Foreign Office]]. During the summer and fall of 1954, the Anglo-Egyptian agreement to withdraw all British forces from Egypt was also negotiated and ratified.

There were concerns that if the [[European Defence Community]] was not ratified as it wanted, the United States might withdraw into defending only the [[Western Hemisphere]], but recent documentary evidence confirms that the US intended to withdraw troops from Europe anyway even if the EDC was ratified.<ref name="Charmley 1995, pp 274–5"/> After the French National Assembly rejected the EDC in August 1954, Eden tried to come up with a viable alternative. Between 11 and 17 September, he visited every major West European capital to negotiate West Germany becoming a sovereign state and entering the Brussels Pact prior to it entering NATO. [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] said that Eden "saved the Atlantic alliance".<ref>Gilbert, Martin. ''Winston S. Churchill: Never Despair: 1945–1965''. (c) 1988: pp. 298–300.</ref>

In October 1954, he was appointed to the [[Order of the Garter]]<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=40310 |date=26 October 1954 |page=6067}}</ref> and became ''Sir Anthony Eden''.

==Prime Minister, 1955–1957==

{{further|Eden ministry}}
In April 1955 Churchill retired, and Eden succeeded him as prime minister. He was a very popular figure as a result of his long wartime service and his famous good looks and charm. His famous words "Peace comes first, always" added to his already substantial popularity.

On taking office, he immediately called a [[1955 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 26 May 1955, at which he increased the Conservative majority from seventeen to sixty, an increase in majority that broke a ninety-year record for any UK government. The 1955 general election was the last in which the Conservatives won the majority share of the votes in Scotland. However, Eden had never held a domestic portfolio and had little experience in economic matters. He left these areas to his lieutenants such as [[Rab Butler]], and concentrated largely on foreign policy, forming a close relationship with US President Dwight Eisenhower. Eden's attempts to maintain overall control of the Foreign Office drew widespread criticism.

Eden has the distinction of being the British prime minister to oversee the lowest unemployment figures of the post-World War II era, with unemployment standing at just over 215,000—barely one per cent of the workforce—in July 1955.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15276765 | work=BBC News | title=Whatever happened to full employment? | date=13 October 2011 | access-date=20 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130165442/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15276765 | archive-date=30 November 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>

===Suez (1956)===
{{further|Suez Crisis|Operation Musketeer (1956)}}
The alliance with the US proved not universal, however, when in July 1956 [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], President of [[Egypt]], nationalised the [[Suez Canal]], following the withdrawal of Anglo-American funding for the [[Aswan Dam]]. Eden believed the nationalisation was in violation of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1954 that Nasser had signed with the British and French governments on 19 October 1954. This view was shared by Labour leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and Liberal leader [[Jo Grimond]].<ref>James Eayrs, ''The Commonwealth and Suez: A Documentary Survey'' (Oxford University Press, 1964)</ref> In 1956 the Suez Canal was of vital importance since over two-thirds of the oil supplies of Western Europe (60 million tons annually) passed through it, with 15,000 ships a year, one-third of them British; three-quarters of all Canal shipping belonged to NATO countries. Britain's total oil reserve at the time of the nationalisation was enough for only six weeks.<ref name="historytoday1">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.historytoday.com/robert-james/anthony-eden-and-suez-crisis |title=Anthony Eden and the Suez Crisis |magazine=History Today |accessdate=21 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305094215/http://www.historytoday.com/robert-james/anthony-eden-and-suez-crisis |archive-date=5 March 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Soviet Union was certain to veto any sanctions against Nasser at the United Nations. Britain and a conference of other nations met in London following the nationalisation in an attempt to resolve the crisis through diplomatic means. However, the Eighteen Nations Proposals, including an offer of Egyptian representation on the board of the [[Suez Canal Company]] and a share of profits, were rejected by Nasser.<ref>Thorpe (2003), p. 506.</ref> Eden feared that Nasser intended to form an Arab Alliance that would threaten to cut off oil supplies to Europe and, in conjunction with France, decided he should be removed from power.<ref>Ian J. Bickerton and Carla L. Klausner, ''A Concise History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict,'' pp. 12–127.</ref>

Eden, drawing on his experience in the 1930s, saw Nasser as another [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], considering the two men aggressive [[fascist]]s determined to invade other countries. Others believed that Nasser was acting from legitimate patriotic concerns and the nationalisation was determined by the Foreign Office to be deliberately provocative but not illegal. The Attorney General, Sir [[Reginald Manningham-Buller]], was not asked for his opinion officially but made his view, that the government's contemplated armed strike against Egypt would be unlawful, known through the Lord Chancellor.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/09/iraq.iraq?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Clare | last=Dyer | title=Clare Dyer: Legality of the war in Iraq | date=9 March 2004 | access-date=11 December 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617053230/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/09/iraq.iraq?INTCMP=SRCH | archive-date=17 June 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Anthony Nutting]] recalled that Eden told him, "What's all this nonsense about isolating Nasser or 'neutralising' him as you call it? I want him destroyed, can't you understand? I want him murdered, and if you and the Foreign Office don't agree, then you'd better come to the cabinet and explain why." When Nutting pointed out that they had no alternative government to replace Nasser, Eden apparently replied, "I don't give a damn if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt."<ref>Robert McNamara. ''Britain, Nasser and the balance of power in the Middle East, 1952–1967'' (2003), p. 46.</ref> At a private meeting at Downing Street on 16 October 1956 Eden showed several ministers a plan, submitted two days earlier by the French. Israel would invade Egypt, Britain and France would give an ultimatum telling both sides to stop and, when one refused, send in forces to enforce the ultimatum, separate the two sides – and occupy the Canal and get rid of Nasser. When Nutting suggested the Americans should be consulted Eden replied, "I will not bring the Americans into this ... Dulles has done enough damage as it is. This has nothing to do with the Americans. We and the French must decide what to do and we alone."<ref>Charles Williams, ''Harold Macmillan'' (2009), p. 254.</ref> Eden openly admitted his view of the crisis was shaped by his experiences in the two world wars, writing, "We are all marked to some extent by the stamp of our generation, mine is that of the assassination in Sarajevo and all that flowed from it. It is impossible to read the record now and not feel that we had a responsibility for always being a lap behind ... Always a lap behind, a fatal lap."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Keep-Calm/2012/0523/With-Crocker-s-exit-a-chance-for-a-new-approach-to-Afghanistan/(page)/2 |title=With Crocker's exit, a chance for a new approach to Afghanistan |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=21 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524205321/http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Keep-Calm/2012/0523/With-Crocker-s-exit-a-chance-for-a-new-approach-to-Afghanistan/(page)/2 |archive-date=24 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

There was no question of an immediate military response to the crisis – Cyprus had no deep-water harbours, which meant that Malta, several days' sailing from Egypt, would have to be the main concentration point for an invasion fleet if the Libyan government would not permit a land invasion from its territory.<ref name="historytoday1"/> Eden initially considered using British forces in the [[Kingdom of Libya]] to regain the Canal, but then decided this risked inflaming Arab opinion.<ref name="qjmed.oxfordjournals.org">{{cite web |author=The Rt Hon Lord Owen CH |url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/6/387.full |title=The effect of Prime Minister Anthony Eden's illness on his decision-making during the Suez crisis |publisher=Qjmed.oxfordjournals.org |date=6 May 2005 |accessdate=21 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925024926/http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/6/387.full |archive-date=25 September 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Unlike the French prime minister [[Guy Mollet]], who saw regaining the Canal as the primary objective, Eden believed the real need was to remove Nasser from office. He hoped that if the Egyptian army was swiftly and humiliatingly defeated by the Anglo-French forces the Egyptian people would rise up against Nasser. Eden told Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] that the overall aim of the mission was simply, "To knock Nasser off his perch."<ref>{{cite news |first=Col.

Eden believed that if Nasser were seen to get away with seizing the Canal then Egypt and other Arab countries might move closer to the Soviet Union. At that time, the Middle East accounted for 80–90 percent of Western Europe's oil supply. Other Middle East countries might also be encouraged to nationalise their oil industries. The invasion, he contended at the time, and again in a 1967 interview, was aimed at maintaining the sanctity of international agreements and at preventing future unilateral denunciation of treaties.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Eden was energetic during the crisis in using the media, including the BBC, to incite public opinion to support his views of the need to overthrow Nasser.<ref>Tony Shaw, "Government Manipulation of the Press during the 1956 Suez Crisis," ''Contemporary Record,'' 1994, 8#2, pp. 274–288.</ref> In September 1956 a plan was drawn up to reduce the flow of water in the Nile by using dams in an attempt to damage Nasser's position. However, the plan was abandoned because it would take months to implement, and due to fears that it could affect other countries such as Uganda and Kenya.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6197002.stm|title=UK considered cutting off Nile|work=BBC News|access-date=21 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303232124/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6197002.stm|archive-date=3 March 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 25 September 1956, the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Harold Macmillan]] met informally with President Eisenhower at the White House; he misread Eisenhower's determination to avoid war and told Eden that the Americans would not in any way oppose the attempt to topple Nasser.<ref>Williams, ''Harold Macmillan'' (2009) pp. 250–252.</ref> Though Eden had known Eisenhower for years and had many direct contacts during the crisis, he also misread the situation. The Americans saw themselves as the champion of decolonisation and refused to support any move that could be seen as imperialism or colonialism. Eisenhower felt the crisis had to be handled peacefully; he told Eden that American public opinion would not support a military solution. Eden and other leading British officials incorrectly believed Nasser's support for Palestinian militia against Israel, as well as his attempts to destabilise pro-western regimes in Iraq and other Arab states, would deter the US from intervening with the operation. Eisenhower specifically warned that the Americans, and the world, "would be outraged" unless all peaceful routes had been exhausted, and even then "the eventual price might become far too heavy".<ref>James, ''Anthony Eden,'' pp. 462–465, quote p. 472 dated 31 July 1956.</ref><ref>C. Philip Skardon, ''A Lesson for Our Times: How America Kept the Peace in the Hungary-Suez Crisis of 1956'' (2010), pp. 194–195.</ref> At the root of the problem was the fact that Eden felt that Britain was still an independent world power. His lack of sympathy for British integration into Europe, manifested in his scepticism about the fledgling European Economic Community (EEC), was another aspect of his belief in Britain's independent role in world affairs.

Israel invaded the Sinai peninsula at the end of October 1956. Britain and France moved in ostensibly to separate the two sides and bring peace, but in fact to regain control of the canal and overthrow Nasser. The United States immediately and strongly opposed the invasion. The United Nations denounced the invasion, the Soviets were bellicose, and only New Zealand, Australia, West Germany and South Africa spoke out for Britain's position.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPQWZwpcx_4C&pg=PA115 |page=115 |title=The Suez crisis |last1=Gorst |first1=Anthony |last2=Johnman |first2=Lewis |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-11449-3 |series=Routledge Sources in History |access-date=29 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124234018/https://books.google.com/books?id=NPQWZwpcx_4C&pg=PA115 |archive-date=24 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Dietl, Ralph "Suez 1956: A European Intervention?" pp. 259–273 from Journal of Contemporary History, Volume 43, Issue # 2, April 2008, p. 273.</ref>

The Suez Canal was of lesser economic importance to the US, which acquired 15 percent of its oil through that route. Eisenhower wanted to broker international peace in "fragile" regions. He did not see Nasser as a serious threat to the West, but he was concerned that the Soviets, who were well known to want a permanent warm water base for their Black Sea fleet in the Mediterranean, might side with Egypt. Eisenhower feared a pro-Soviet backlash amongst the Arab nations if, as seemed likely, Egypt suffered an humiliating defeat at the hands of the British, French and Israelis.<ref>{{cite book|author=Simon C.

Eden, who faced domestic pressure from his party to take action, as well as stopping the decline of British influence in the Middle East,<ref name="Dutton"/> had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US in the wake of the Second World War, and had assumed the US would automatically endorse whatever action taken by its closest ally. At the 'Law not War' rally in [[Trafalgar Square]] on 4 November 1956, Eden was ridiculed by [[Aneurin Bevan]]: 'Sir Anthony Eden has been pretending that he is now invading Egypt to strengthen the United Nations. Every burglar of course could say the same thing; he could argue that he was entering the house to train the police. So, if Sir Anthony Eden is sincere in what he is saying, and he may be, then he is too ''stupid'' to be a prime minister'. Public opinion was mixed; some historians think that the majority of public opinion in the UK was on Eden's side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/norfolk-life/drama_sparks_suez_crisis_memories_1_949446 |title=Drama sparks Suez Crisis memories |work=Norfolk life – Eastern Daily Press |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=21 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102190920/http://www.edp24.co.uk/norfolk-life/drama_sparks_suez_crisis_memories_1_949446 |archive-date=2 November 2014 }}</ref> Eden was forced to bow to American diplomatic and financial pressure, and protests at home, by calling a ceasefire when Anglo-French forces had captured only 23 miles of the Canal. With the US threatening to withdraw financial support from sterling, the cabinet divided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Harold Macmillan]] threatening to resign unless an immediate ceasefire was called, Eden was under immense pressure. He considered defying the calls until the commander on the ground told him it could take up to six days for the Anglo-French troops to secure the entire Canal zone. Therefore, a ceasefire was called at quarter past midnight on 7 November.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In his 1987 book ''[[Spycatcher]]'' [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]] said that, following the imposed ending to the military operation, Eden reactivated the assassination option for a second time. By this time virtually all MI6 agents in Egypt had been rounded up by Nasser, and a new operation, using renegade Egyptian officers, was drawn up. It failed principally because the cache of weapons which had been hidden on the outskirts of Cairo was found to be defective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWnasser.htm |title=Gamal Nasser : Biography |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |accessdate=21 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614134002/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWnasser.htm |archive-date=14 June 2012 }}</ref>

Suez badly damaged Eden's reputation for statesmanship, and led to a breakdown in his health. He went on vacation to [[Jamaica]] in November 1956, at a time when he was still determined to soldier on as prime minister. His health, however, did not improve, and during his absence from London his Chancellor [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Rab Butler]] worked to manoeuvre him out of office. On the morning of the ceasefire Eisenhower agreed to meet with Eden to publicly resolve their differences, but this offer was later withdrawn after Secretary of State Dulles advised that it could inflame the Middle Eastern situation further.<ref name="Kyle, Keith p. 489">Kyle, Keith ''Britain's End of Empire in the Middle East'', p. 489.</ref>

''The Observer'' newspaper accused Eden of lying to Parliament over the Suez Crisis, while MPs from all parties criticised his calling a ceasefire before the Canal was taken. Churchill, while publicly supportive of Eden's actions, privately criticised his successor for not seeing the military operation through to its conclusion. Eden easily survived a vote of confidence in the House of Commons on 8 November.<ref name="Kyle, Keith p. 489"/>

====1957 resignation====
While Eden was on holiday in Jamaica, other members of the government discussed on 20 November how to counter charges that the UK and France had worked in collusion with Israel to seize the Canal, but decided there was very little evidence in the public domain.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/3122846/Sir-Anthony-Edens-cabinet-discussed-concealing-Suez-collusion-records-show.html | location=London | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | first=John | last=Bingham | title=Sir Anthony Eden's cabinet discussed concealing Suez 'collusion', records show | date=2 October 2008 | access-date=3 April 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220070416/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/3122846/Sir-Anthony-Edens-cabinet-discussed-concealing-Suez-collusion-records-show.html | archive-date=20 February 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>

On his return from Jamaica on 14 December, Eden still hoped to continue as prime minister. He had lost his traditional base of support on the Tory left and amongst moderate opinion nationally, but appears to have hoped to rebuild a new base of support amongst the Tory Right.<ref name="Rothwell 1992, p244, 247">Rothwell 1992, pp. 244, 247.</ref> However, his political position had eroded during his absence. He wished to make a statement attacking Nasser as a puppet of the Soviets, attacking the United Nations and speaking of the "lessons of the 1930s", but was prevented from doing so by Macmillan, Butler and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]].<ref>Charmley 1995, pp. 352–353.</ref>

On his return to the House of Commons (17 December), he slipped into the Chamber largely unacknowledged by his own party. One Conservative MP rose to wave his [[Order Paper]], only to have to sit down in embarrassment whilst Labour MPs laughed.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, pp. 591–2 Rhodes James was a clerk of the House of Commons in the 1950s. His account of this incident appears to be that of a personal eyewitness.</ref> On 18 December he addressed the [[1922 committee]] (Conservative backbenchers), declaring "as long as I live, I shall never apologise for what we did", but was unable to answer a question about the validity of the [[Tripartite Declaration of 1950]] (which he had in fact reaffirmed in April 1955, two days before becoming Prime Minister).<ref name="Rothwell 1992, p244, 247"/> In his final statement to the House of Commons as prime minister (20 December 1956), he performed well in a difficult debate, but told MPs that "there was not foreknowledge that Israel would attack Egypt". Victor Rothwell writes that the knowledge of his having misled the House of Commons in this way must have hung over him thereafter, as was the concern that the US Administration might demand that Britain pay reparations to Egypt.<ref name="Rothwell 1992, p244, 247"/> Papers released in January 1987 showed the entire cabinet had been informed of the plan on 23 October 1956.<ref name="qjmed.oxfordjournals.org"/>

Eden suffered another fever at [[Chequers]] over Christmas, but was still talking of going on an official trip to the USSR in April 1957, wanting a full inquiry into the [[Crabb affair]] and badgering [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]] ([[First Lord of the Admiralty]]) about the £6m being spent on oil storage at Malta.<ref name="Rothwell 1992, p244, 247"/>

Eden resigned on 9 January 1957, after his doctors warned him his life was at stake if he continued in office.<ref>James, ''Anthony Eden'', p. 595-</ref> [[John Charmley]] writes "Ill-health ... provide(d) a dignified reason for an action (i.e.. resignation) which would, in any event, have been necessary."<ref>Charmley 1995, p. 353.</ref> Rothwell writes that "mystery persists" over exactly how Eden was persuaded to resign, although the limited evidence suggests that Butler, who was expected to succeed him as prime minister, was at the centre of the intrigue. Rothwell writes that Eden's fevers were "nasty but brief and not life-threatening" and that there may have been "manipulation of medical evidence" to make Eden's health seem "even worse" than it was. Macmillan wrote in his diary that "nature had provided a real health reason" when a "diplomatic illness" might otherwise have had to be invented. David Carlton (1981) even suggested that the Palace might have been involved, a suggestion discussed by Rothwell. As early as spring 1954 Eden had been indifferent to cultivating good relations with the new Queen. Eden is known to have favoured a Japanese or [[Scandinavia]]n style monarchy (i.e. with no involvement in politics whatsoever) and in January 1956 he had insisted that [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] spend only the minimum amount of time in talks with the Queen. Evidence also exists that the Palace was concerned at not being kept fully informed during the Suez Crisis. In the 1960s, Clarissa Eden was observed to speak of the Queen "in an extremely hostile and belittling way", and in an interview in 1976, Eden commented that he "would not claim she was pro-Suez".<ref>Rothwell 1992, pp. 245–246.</ref>

Although the media expected Butler would get the nod as Eden's successor, a survey of the cabinet taken for the Queen showed Macmillan was the nearly unanimous choice, and he became prime minister on 10 January 1957.<ref>James, ''Anthony Eden'', pp. 599–600.</ref> Shortly afterwards Eden and his wife left England for a holiday in New Zealand.

====Suez in retrospect====
[[A. J. P. Taylor]] wrote in the 1970s: "Eden … destroyed (his reputation as a peacemaker) and led Great Britain to one of the greatest humiliations in her history … (he) seemed to take on a new personality. He acted impatiently and on impulse. Previously flexible he now relied on dogma, denouncing Nasser as a second Hitler. Though he claimed to be upholding international law, he in fact disregarded the United Nations Organisation which he had helped to create...The outcome was pathetic rather than tragic".<ref>Aster 1976, intro (no page number)</ref>

Biographer D. R. Thorpe says Eden's four goals were to secure the canal; to make sure it remained open and that oil shipments would continue; to depose Nasser; and to prevent the USSR from gaining influence. "The immediate consequence of the crisis was that the Suez Canal was blocked, oil supplies were interrupted, Nasser's position as the leader of Arab nationalism was strengthened, and the way was left open for Russian intrusion into the Middle East.<ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 357–358.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Garnett|display-authors=et al|title=British Foreign Policy since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Hc2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT154|year=2017|page=154|isbn=9781317588993}}</ref>

[[Michael Foot]] pushed for a special inquiry along the lines of the Parliamentary Inquiry into the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Attack on the Dardanelles]] in the First World War, although [[Harold Wilson]] (Labour Prime Minister 1964–70 and 1974–76) regarded the matter as a can of worms best left unopened. This talk ceased after the defeat of the Arab armies by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, after which Eden received a lot of fanmail telling him that he had been right, and his reputation, not least in Israel and the United States, soared.<ref name="historytoday1"/><ref>Rhodes James 1986, pp. 612–614.</ref> In 1986 Eden's official biographer [[Robert Rhodes James]] re-evaluated sympathetically Eden's stance over Suez<ref>Robert Rhodes James (1986) ''Anthony Eden''.</ref> and in 1990, following the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]], James asked: "Who can now claim that Eden was wrong?".<ref>Letter, ''The Daily Telegraph'', 7 August 1990.</ref> Such arguments turn mostly on whether, as a matter of policy, the Suez operation was fundamentally flawed or whether, as such "revisionists" thought, the lack of American support conveyed the impression that the West was divided and weak. [[Anthony Nutting]], who resigned as a Foreign Office Minister over Suez, expressed the former view in 1967, the year of the Arab–Israeli Six-Day War, when he wrote that "we had sown the wind of bitterness and we were to reap the whirlwind of revenge and rebellion".<ref>Anthony Nutting (1967) ''No End of a Lesson''</ref> Conversely, Jonathan Pearson argues in ''Sir Anthony Eden and the Suez Crisis: Reluctant Gamble'' (2002) that Eden was more reluctant and less bellicose than most historians have judged. [[D. R. Thorpe]], another of Eden's biographers, writes that Suez was "a truly tragic end to his premiership, and one that came to assume a disproportionate importance in any assessment of his careers"; he suggests that had the Suez venture succeeded, "there would almost certainly have been no Middle East war in 1967, and probably no [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973 also".<ref>D. R. Thorpe (2003) ''Eden''.</ref>

[[Guy Millard]], one of Eden's Private Secretaries, who thirty years later, in a radio interview, spoke publicly for the first time on the crisis, made an insider's judgement about Eden: "It was his mistake of course and a tragic and disastrous mistake for him. I think he overestimated the importance of Nasser, Egypt, the Canal, even of the Middle East."<ref name="qjmed.oxfordjournals.org"/> While British actions in 1956 are routinely described as "imperialistic", the motivation was in fact economic. Eden was a liberal supporter of nationalist ambitions, such as over Sudanese independence. His 1954 Suez Canal Base Agreement (withdrawing British troops from Suez in return for certain guarantees) was sold to the Conservative Party against Churchill's wishes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3656288/What-we-failed-to-learn-from-Suez.html |title=What we failed to learn from Suez |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=21 July 2012 |first=D.

Rothwell believes that Eden should have cancelled the Suez Invasion plans in mid-October, when the Anglo-French negotiations at the United Nations were making some headway, and that in 1956 the Arab countries threw away a chance to make peace with Israel on her existing borders.<ref>Rothwell 1992, pp. 254–255.</ref>

===Britain–France rejected plan for union ===
British Government cabinet papers from September 1956, during Eden's term as prime minister, have shown that French Prime Minister [[Guy Mollet]] approached the British Government suggesting the idea of an [[Franco-British Union#Suez Crisis (1956)|economic and political union between France and Great Britain]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6261885.stm When Britain and France nearly married] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117021254/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6261885.stm |date=17 January 2007 }} 15 January 2007.</ref> This was a similar offer, in reverse, to that made by Churchill (drawing on a plan devised by [[Leo Amery]]<ref>See David Faber (2005) ''Speaking for England''.</ref>) in June 1940.<ref>See, for example, Julian Jackson (2003) ''The Fall of France''.</ref>

The offer by [[Guy Mollet]] was referred to by Sir [[John Colville (civil servant)|John Colville]], Churchill's former private secretary, in his collected diaries, ''The Fringes of Power'' (1985), his having gleaned the information in 1957 from Air Chief Marshal Sir [[William Dickson (RAF officer)|William Dickson]] during an air flight (and, according to Colville, after several whiskies and soda).<ref name="Postscript">"Postscript to Suez", recording conversation of 9 April 1957: John Colville (1985) ''The Fringes of Power, Volume Two''</ref> Mollet's request for Union with Britain was rejected by Eden, but the additional possibility of France joining the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] was considered, although similarly rejected. Colville noted, in respect of Suez, that Eden and his Foreign Secretary [[Selwyn Lloyd]] "felt still more beholden to the French on account of this offer".<ref name="Postscript"/>

==Retirement==
Eden also resigned from the House of Commons when he stood down as prime minister.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp 608–9">Rhodes James 1986, pp. 608–609.</ref> Eden kept in touch with Lord Salisbury, agreeing with him that Macmillan had been the better choice as prime minister, but sympathising with his resignation over Macmillan's Cyprus policy. Despite a series of letters in which Macmillan almost begged him for a personal endorsement prior to the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 election]], Eden only issued a declaration of support for the Conservative Government.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp 609–10">Rhodes James 1986, pp. 609–610.</ref> Eden retained much of his personal popularity in Britain and contemplated returning to Parliament. Several Conservative MPs were reportedly willing to give up their seats for him, although the party hierarchy were less keen. He finally gave up such hopes in late 1960 after an exhausting speaking tour of Yorkshire.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp 608–9"/> Macmillan initially offered to recommend him for a viscountcy, which Eden assumed to be a calculated insult, and he was granted an earldom (which was then the traditional rank for a former prime minister) after reminding Macmillan that he had already been offered one by the queen.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, pp 609–10"/> He entered the [[House of Lords]] as the [[Earl of Avon]] in 1961.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=42411 |date=14 July 1961 |page=5175}}</ref>

In retirement Eden lived in 'Rose Bower' by the banks of the [[River Ebble]] in [[Broad Chalke]], Wiltshire. Starting in 1961 he bred a herd of sixty [[Hereford (cattle)|Herefordshire cattle]] (one of whom was called "Churchill") until a further decline in his health forced him to sell them in 1975.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 617.</ref> In 1968, he bought [[Alvediston Manor]], where he lived until his death in 1977.{{sfn|Rhodes James|1985|p=613}}

In July 1962 Eden made front-page news by commenting that "Mr Selwyn Lloyd has been horribly treated" when the latter was dismissed as Chancellor in the reshuffle known as the "[[Night of the Long Knives (1962)|Night of the Long Knives]]". In August 1962, at a dinner party, he had a "slanging match" with [[Nigel Birch, Baron Rhyl|Nigel Birch]], who as [[Secretary of State for Air]] had not wholeheartedly supported the Suez Invasion.<ref>Rothwell 1992, p. 248.</ref> In 1963 Eden initially favoured Hailsham for the Conservative leadership but then supported [[Alec Douglas-Home|Home]] as a compromise candidate.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p611">Rhodes James 1986, p. 611.</ref>

From 1945 to 1973, Eden was [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Birmingham]]. In a television interview in 1966 he called on the United States to halt its bombing of North Vietnam to concentrate on developing a peace plan "that might conceivably be acceptable to Hanoi." The bombing of North Vietnam, he argued, would never settle the conflict in South Vietnam. "On the contrary," he declared, "bombing creates a sort of David and Goliath complex in any country that has to suffer—as we had to, and as I suspect the Germans had to, in the last war."<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Eden sat for extensive interviews for the famed multi-part Thames Television production, ''[[The World at War (TV series)|The World at War]]'', which was first broadcast in 1973. He also featured frequently in [[Marcel Ophüls]]' 1969 documentary ''[[The Sorrow and the Pity|Le chagrin et la pitié]]'', discussing the [[German occupation of France in World War II|occupation of France]] in a wider geopolitical context. He spoke impeccable, if accented, French.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1760503,00.html We would have done the same under Nazi occupation] Tuesday 25 April 2006.</ref>

Eden's occasional articles and his early 1970s television appearance were an exception to an almost total retirement.<ref>Aster 1976, pp. 164–165.</ref> He seldom appeared in public, unlike other former prime ministers, e.g. [[James Callaghan]] who commented frequently on current affairs.<ref name="Rothwell 1992, p 249">Rothwell 1992, p. 249-</ref> He was even accidentally omitted from a list of Conservative prime ministers by [[Margaret Thatcher]] when she became Conservative leader in 1975, although she later went out of her way to establish relations with Eden, and later, his widow.<ref name="Rothwell 1992, p 249" /> In retirement, he was highly critical of regimes such as [[Sukarno]]'s [[Indonesia]] which confiscated assets belonging to their former colonial rulers, and appears to have reverted somewhat to the right-wing views which he had espoused in the 1920s.<ref>Rothwell 1992, p. 251,</ref>

===Memoirs===
In retirement Eden corresponded with Selwyn Lloyd, coordinating the release of information and with which writers they would agree to speak and when. Rumours that Britain had colluded with France and Israel appeared, albeit in garbled form, as early as 1957. By the 1970s they had agreed that Lloyd would only tell his version of the story after Eden's death (in the event, Lloyd would outlive Eden by a year, struggling with terminal illness to complete his own memoirs).<ref>Rothwell 1992, pp. 246–247.</ref>

In retirement Eden was particularly bitter that Eisenhower had initially indicated British and French troops should be allowed to remain around Port Said, only for the US ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr]] to press for an immediate withdrawal at the UN, thereby rendering the operation a complete failure. Eden felt the Eisenhower administration's unexpected opposition was hypocritical in light of the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]] and the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]].

Eden published three volumes of political memoirs, in which he denied that there had been any collusion with France and Israel. Like Churchill, Eden relied heavily on the ghost-writing of young researchers, whose drafts he would sometimes toss angrily into the flowerbeds outside his study. One of them was the young [[David Dilks]].<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p611"/>

In his view, American Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]], whom he particularly disliked, was responsible for the ill fate of the Suez adventure. In an October press conference, barely three weeks before the fighting began, Dulles had coupled the Suez Canal issue with colonialism, and his statement infuriated Eden and much of the UK as well. "The dispute over Nasser's seizure of the canal," wrote Eden, "had, of course, nothing to do with colonialism, but was concerned with international rights." He added that "if the United States had to defend her treaty rights in the [[Panama Canal]], she would not regard such action as colonialism."<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1960/04/suez-in-retrospect-anthony-eden-apos-s-memoirs/5585/2/ |title=Suez in Retrospect: Anthony Eden's Memoirs |first=Chalmers |last=Roberts |journal=[[The Atlantic]] | date=April 1960 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> His lack of candour further diminished his standing and a principal concern in his later years was trying to rebuild his reputation that was severely damaged by Suez, sometimes taking legal action to protect his viewpoint.<ref name="Dutton"/>

Eden faulted the United States for forcing him to withdraw, but he took credit for United Nations action in patrolling the Israeli-Egyptian borders. Eden said of the invasion, "Peace at any price has never averted war. We must not repeat the mistakes of the pre-war years, by behaving as though the enemies of peace and order are armed with only good intentions." Recalling the incident in a 1967 interview, he declared, "I am still unrepentant about Suez. People never look at what would have happened if we had done nothing. There is a parallel with the 1930s. If you allow people to break agreements with impunity, the appetite grows to feed on such things. I don't see what other we ought to have done. One cannot dodge. It is hard to act rather than dodge."<ref name="nytimes.com"/> In his 1967 interview (which he stipulated would not be used until after his death), Eden acknowledged secret dealings with the French and "intimations" of the Israeli attack. He insisted, however, that "the joint enterprise and the preparations for it were justified in the light of the wrongs it [the Anglo-French invasion] was designed to prevent." "I have no apologies to offer," Eden declared.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

At the time of his retirement, Eden had been short of money, although he was paid a £100,000 advance for his memoirs by ''[[The Times]]'', with any profit over this amount to be split between himself and the newspaper. By 1970, they had brought him £185,000 (around £3,000,000 at 2014 prices), leaving him a wealthy man for the first time in his life. Towards the end of his life, he published a personal memoir of his early life, ''Another World'' (1976).<ref name="measuringworth.com"/><ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 616 It is unclear from the wording whether this includes the initial £100,000.</ref>

==Personal life==

===Relationships===
On 5 November 1923, shortly before his election to Parliament, he married [[Beatrice Beckett]], who was then eighteen.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, pp. 68–72.</ref> They had three sons: Simon Gascoigne (1924–1945), Robert, who died fifteen minutes after being born in October 1928, and [[Nicholas Eden, 2nd Earl of Avon|Nicholas]] (1930–1985).<ref>Rhodes James 1986, pp. 96–97.</ref>

The marriage was not a success, with both parties apparently conducting affairs. By the mid-1930s his diaries seldom mention Beatrice.<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p158">Rhodes James 1986, p. 158.</ref> The marriage finally broke up under the strain of the loss of their son Simon, who was killed in action with the RAF in Burma in 1945. His plane was reported "missing in action" on 23 June and found on 16 July; Eden did not want the news to be public until after the election result on 26 July, to avoid claims of "making political capital" from it.{{sfn|Thorpe|2003|p=313}}

Between 1946 and 1950, whilst separated from his wife, Eden conducted an open affair with Dorothy, Countess Beatty, the wife of [[David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty|David, Earl Beatty]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mount |first1=Ferdinand |title=Always the Same Dream |journal=The London Review of Books |date=2018-01-04 |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n01/ferdinand-mount/always-the-same-dream |accessdate=9 September 2020}}</ref>

Eden was the great-great-grandnephew of author [[Emily Eden]] and in 1947, wrote an introduction to her novel ''The Semi-Attached Couple'' (1860).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798038,00.html |title=Books: Not New but Fresh |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=23 June 1947 |accessdate=15 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226181244/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798038,00.html |archive-date=26 February 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1950, Eden and Beatrice were finally divorced, and in 1952, he married Churchill's niece [[Clarissa Eden|Clarissa Spencer-Churchill]], a nominal Roman Catholic who was fiercely criticised by Catholic writer [[Evelyn Waugh]] for marrying a divorced man. Eden's second marriage was much more successful than his first had been.

===Health issues===
Eden had a stomach ulcer, exacerbated by overwork, as early as the 1920s.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 93.</ref> During an operation to remove [[gallstone]]s on 12 April 1953, his [[bile duct]] was damaged, leaving Eden susceptible to recurrent infections, biliary obstruction, and liver failure. The physician consulted at the time was the royal physician, Sir [[Horace Evans, 1st Baron Evans]]. Three surgeons were recommended and Eden chose the one that had previously performed his [[appendectomy]], [[John Basil Hume]], surgeon from [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kunne|first=Gabriel|date=2003|title=Anthony Eden's bile duct: portrait of an ailing leader|url=https://docslide.us/documents/anthony-edens-bile-duct-portrait-of-an-ailing-leader.html|journal= ANZ Journal of Surgery|volume=73|issue=5|pages=341–345|pmid=12752293|doi=10.1046/j.1445-2197.2003.t01-1-02625.x|s2cid=21569199|access-date=27 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228000117/https://docslide.us/documents/anthony-edens-bile-duct-portrait-of-an-ailing-leader.html|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Eden suffered from [[cholangitis]], an abdominal infection which became so agonising that he was admitted to hospital in 1956 with a temperature reaching {{convert|106|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.

He was also prescribed [[Benzedrine]], the wonder drug of the 1950s. Regarded then as a harmless [[stimulant]], it belongs to the family of drugs called [[amphetamines]], and at that time they were prescribed and used in a very casual way. Among the side effects of Benzedrine are insomnia, restlessness, and mood swings, all of which Eden suffered during the Suez Crisis; indeed, earlier in his premiership he complained of being kept awake at night by the sound of motor scooters.<ref>Cecil Beaton, diary, quoted in Hugo Vickers (1994) ''Loving Garbo''.</ref> Eden's drug use is now commonly agreed to have been a part of the reason for his bad judgment while prime minister.<ref name="Dutton"/> The Thorpe biography, however, denied Eden's abuse of Benzedrine, stating that the allegations were "untrue, as is made clear by Eden's medical records at Birmingham University, not yet [at the time] available for research".<ref name=Thorpe2003/>

The resignation document written by Eden for release to the cabinet on 9 January 1957 admitted his dependence on stimulants but not that they affected his judgement during the Suez crisis in the autumn of 1956. "... I have been obliged to increase the drugs [taken after the "bad abdominal operations"] considerably and also increase the stimulants necessary to counteract the drugs. This has finally had an adverse effect on my precarious inside," he wrote. However, in his book ''The Suez Affair'' (1966), historian [[Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|Hugh Thomas]], quoted by [[David Owen]], claimed that Eden had revealed to a colleague that he was "practically living on Benzedrine" at the time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Owen |first=David |date=1 June 2005 |title=The effect of Prime Minister Anthony Eden's illness on his decision-making during the Suez crisis |url=https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/98/6/387/1548168 |journal=QJM: An International Journal of Medicine |volume=96 |issue=6 |pages=387–402 |access-date=10 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211110857/https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/98/6/387/1548168 |archive-date=11 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Final illness and death==
[[File:Tomb of Anthony Eden, Earl of Avon 1897-1977 - geograph.org.uk - 314379.jpg|thumb|Tomb in Alvediston]]

In December 1976, Eden felt well enough to travel with his wife to the United States to spend Christmas and New Year with [[Averell Harriman|Averell]] and [[Pamela Harriman]], but after reaching the States his health rapidly deteriorated. Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]] arranged for an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] plane that was already in America to divert to [[Miami]], to fly Eden home.<ref>D. R. Thorpe, ''Eden: The Life and Times of Anthony Eden First Earl of Avon, 1897–1977'' (New York: Random House, 2003).</ref>

Eden died from [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] at his home [[Alvediston Manor]] on 14 January 1977, aged 79.{{sfn|Rhodes James|1985|p=620}} He was survived by Clarissa.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1566824/Clarissa-Eden-A-witness-to-history.html |title=Clarissa Eden: A witness to history |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=21 October 2007 |accessdate=21 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226200857/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1566824/Clarissa-Eden-A-witness-to-history.html |archive-date=26 December 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> His will was proven on 17 March, with his estate amounting to £92,900 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|92900|1977|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/Calendar?surname=Avon&yearOfDeath=1977&page=1#calendar |title=Avon, Earl, The Rt. Hon. Robert Anthony |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1977 |website=probatesearchservice.gov |publisher=UK Government |access-date=13 August 2019 }}</ref>

He was buried in St Mary's churchyard at [[Alvediston]], just three miles upstream from 'Rose Bower', at the source of the River Ebble. Eden's papers are housed at the [[University of Birmingham]] Special Collections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.special-coll.bham.ac.uk |title=Special Collections |publisher=Special-coll.bham.ac.uk |accessdate=15 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828141622/http://www.special-coll.bham.ac.uk/ |archive-date=28 August 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

At his death, Eden was the last surviving member of Churchill's [[Churchill war ministry|War Cabinet]]. Eden's surviving son, [[Nicholas Eden, 2nd Earl of Avon]] (1930–1985), known as Viscount Eden from 1961 to 1977, was also a politician and a minister in the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government until his death from [[AIDS]] at the age of 54.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nicholas Eden, Earl of Avon And Former Aide to Thatcher|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/21/world/nicholas-eden-earl-of-avon-and-former-aide-to-thatcher.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=16 November 2016|date=21 August 1985|agency=[[Associated Press]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822022308/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/21/world/nicholas-eden-earl-of-avon-and-former-aide-to-thatcher.html|archive-date=22 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Character, speaking style and assessments==
Eden, who was well-mannered, well-groomed, and good-looking, always made a particularly cultured appearance. This gave him huge popular support throughout his political life, but some contemporaries felt he was merely a superficial person lacking any deeper convictions.

That view was enforced by his very [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to politics. Sir [[Oswald Mosley]], for example, said he never understood why Eden was so strongly pushed by the [[Tory]] party, as he felt that Eden's abilities were very much inferior to those of [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Oliver Stanley]].<ref>Sir Oswald Mosley. ''My Life'' London, 1968.</ref> In 1947, [[Richard Crossman|Dick Crossman]] called Eden "that peculiarly British type, the idealist without conviction".<ref>Rothwell 1992, p. 250.</ref>

US Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] regarded Eden as a quite old-fashioned amateur in politics typical of the British Establishment.<ref name="Dutton"/> In contrast, Soviet Leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] commented that until his Suez adventure Eden had been "in the top world class".<ref>Rothwell 1992, p. 255.</ref>

Eden was heavily influenced by Stanley Baldwin when he first entered Parliament. After earlier combative beginnings, he cultivated a low-key speaking style that relied heavily on rational argument and consensus-building, rather than rhetoric and party point-scoring, which was often highly effective in the [[House of Commons]].<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 624.</ref> However, he was not always an effective public speaker, and his parliamentary performances sometimes disappointed many of his followers, such as after his resignation from [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government. [[Winston Churchill]] once even commented on one of Eden's speeches that the latter had used every [[cliché]] except "[[1 John|God is love]]".<ref name="Time-man who waited"/> That was deliberate since Eden often struck out original phrases from speech drafts and replaced them with clichés.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 161.</ref>

Eden's inability to express himself clearly is often attributed to shyness and lack of self-confidence. Eden is known to have been much more direct in meeting with his secretaries and advisers than in cabinet meetings and public speeches and sometimes tended to become enraged and behave "like a child",<ref>Evelyn Shuckburgh: ''Descent to Suez. Diaries 1951–1956''. London, 1986.</ref> only to regain his temper within a few minutes.<ref name="Dutton"/> Many who worked for him remarked that he was "two men": one charming, erudite, and hard-working and the other petty and prone to temper tantrums during which he would insult his subordinates.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 623.</ref>

As prime minister, Eden was notorious for telephoning ministers and newspaper editors from 6 a.m. onward. Rothwell wrote that even before Suez, the telephone had become "a drug": "During the Suez Crisis Eden's telephone mania exceeded all bounds".<ref>Rothwell 1992, p. 254.</ref>

Eden was notoriously "unclubbable" and offended Churchill by declining to join [[The Other Club]]. He also declined honorary membership in the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum]].<ref name="Rhodes James 1986, p158"/> However, he maintained friendly relations with Opposition MPs; for example, [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]] received a kind two-page letter from Eden on learning that his stepfather had died.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 160.</ref> Eden was a Trustee of the [[National Gallery]] (in succession to MacDonald) between 1935 and 1949. He also had a deep knowledge of Persian poetry and of [[Shakespeare]] and would bond with anybody who could display similar knowledge.<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 162.</ref>

Rothwell wrote that although Eden was capable of acting with ruthlessness, for instance over [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II|the repatriation of the Cossacks]] in 1945, his main concern was to avoid being seen as "an appeaser", such as over the Soviet reluctance to accept a democratic Poland in October 1944. Like many people, Eden convinced himself that his past actions were more consistent than they had in fact been.<ref>Rothwell 1992, pp. 251–252.</ref>

Recent biographies put more emphasis on Eden's achievements in foreign policy and perceive him to have held deep convictions regarding world peace and security as well as a strong social conscience.<ref name="RRJames"/> Rhodes James applied to Eden Churchill's famous verdict on [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] (in ''[[Great Contemporaries]]''): "The morning had been golden; the noontime was bronze; and the evening lead. But all was solid, and each was polished until it shone after its fashion".<ref>Rhodes James 1986, p. 625.</ref>
