'''Urdd Gobaith Cymru''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈɨrð ˈɡɔbaɪθ ˈkəmrɨ}}) (known as the '''Urdd''') is a national voluntary youth organisation, which claimed over 56,000 members in 2019<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Annual Report 2018-19 Urdd Gobaith Cymru|url=https://www.urdd.cymru/files/4015/7480/5640/Annual_Report_2018-19.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 October 2020|website=Urdd Gobaith Cymru}}</ref> aged between 8 and 25 years old. It provides opportunities for children and young people across Wales to take part in a range of experiences through the medium of [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

Urdd Gobaith Cymru also has 5 residential centres for children and young people across [[Wales]]. 

The main aim is to ensure that all young people in Wales are given the opportunity, through the medium of Welsh, to play a constructive role in the community, developing personal and social skills'. Up till 2019, 4 million children and young people have engaged with the Urdd in one form or another.

The Urdd National Eisteddfod (Welsh: ''Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Urdd Gobaith Cymru'' or ''Eisteddfod Genedlaethol yr Urdd'') is an annual Welsh-language youth festival of literature, music and performing arts organised by Urdd Gobaith Cymru. Arguably [[Europe]]'s largest youth festival,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.countytimes.co.uk/news/16247751.powys-is-ready-to-host-europes-largest-youth-festival/|title=Powys is ready to host Europe's largest youth festival|website=County Times|language=en|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> it is usually held during the last week of May, coinciding with schools' half term holiday. 

==History==
Urdd Gobaith Cymru was established by [[Ifan ab Owen Edwards|Sir Ifan ab Owen Edwards]] in [[1922]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cymraeg.gov.wales/events/Societies/Yr-Urdd/?lang=en|title=Yr Urdd|last=Government|first=Welsh|date=2015-02-09|website=cymraeg.gov.wales|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> His aim was to protect the Welsh language in a world where the English language dominated every aspect of life outside the home. In an issue of the magazine ''‘Cymru’r Plant’'' in 1922 Sir Ifan said, "These days, in many villages, and in most towns in Wales, children play and read in English. They forget that they are Welsh."

He appealed to the children of Wales to join a new organization that offered opportunities through the medium of Welsh, and as a result, Urdd Gobaith Cymru was established.

Nearly a century later, Urdd Gobaith Cymru, the main youth organization in Wales, has over 56,000 members, belonging to over 900 branches who take part in a wide range of activities. The work is carried out with the help of 260 staff and 10,000 volunteers. The Chief Executive appointed in 2015 to take the movement forward to the 2022 centenary left in 2017 after Trustees took action following the expression of a lack of faith in her ability by staff.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-40614723 |website=BBC News |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref> The current Chief Executive of Urdd Gobaith Cymru is Sian Lewis.

== Eisteddfod yr Urdd ==
The '''Urdd National Eisteddfod''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Urdd Gobaith Cymru'' or ''Eisteddfod Genedlaethol yr Urdd'') is an annual Welsh-language youth festival of literature, music and performing arts organised by Urdd Gobaith Cymru. Arguably Europe's largest youth festival, it is usually held during the last week of May, coinciding with schools' half term holiday. Locations alternate between north and south Wales.

The Eisteddfod consists of competitive [[singing]], [[recitation]], art, composition, [[dance]] and [[instrumental]] events for contestants aged between 7 and 24 years. Regional qualifying heats are held in advance around Wales, as occurs for the [[National Eisteddfod]].

In 2019, the Eisteddfod yr Urdd was held in Cardiff Bay. In 2020, it was planned to be held in [[Denbigh]] but was cancelled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

The Urdd's Sports Department hosts a wide range of community sports clubs and national sporting events for children and young people through the medium of Welsh.

The Sports Department, supported by Sport Wales, now employs 20 staff and trains over 1,000 volunteers annually. This has enabled the organisation to offer regular activities for children and young people, with 150 sports clubs held weekly across the country, and over 11,000 children attending.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.urdd.cymru/en/sports/|title=Urdd Gobaith Cymru / Sports|website=www.urdd.cymru|language=en|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref>
