'''William Henry<!-- Do not include "Bill" here per [[MOS:HYPOCORISM]] --> Cosby Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|z|b|i}}; born July 12, 1937) is an American [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]], actor, author, and convicted [[sex offender]]. Cosby began his career as a stand-up comic at the [[hungry i]] in [[San Francisco]] during the 1960s. He then landed a starring role in the television show ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'', followed by his own sitcom ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'', which ran for two seasons from 1969 to 1971. In 1972, using the [[Fat Albert]] character developed during his stand-up routines, Cosby created, produced, and hosted the animated comedy television series ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'' which ran until 1985, centering on a group of young friends growing up in an urban area. Throughout the 1970s, Cosby starred in about half a dozen films, and he occasionally returned to film later in his career. In 1976, he earned his [[Doctor of Education]] from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. His dissertation discussed the use of ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' as a teaching tool in elementary schools.<!-- linked at its mention within the main article below -->

Beginning in the 1980s, Cosby produced and starred in the television sitcom ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', which aired from 1984 to 1992 and was rated as the number one show in America from 1985 through 1989. The sitcom highlighted the experiences and growth of an affluent [[African-American]] family. Cosby produced the spin-off sitcom ''[[A Different World]]'', which aired from 1987 to 1993. He also starred in ''[[The Cosby Mysteries]]'' from 1994 to 1995 and in the sitcom ''[[Cosby (TV series)|Cosby]]'' from 1996 to 2000 and hosted ''[[Kids Say the Darndest Things]]'' from 1998 to 2000.

Cosby's reputation was tarnished during the mid-2010s when numerous women made [[Bill Cosby sexual assault cases|sexual assault accusations]] against him, the earliest dating back to 1965. More than 60 women have accused him of either attempted [[sexual assault]], [[rape]], [[drug-facilitated sexual assault]], [[sexual battery]], [[child sexual abuse]], or [[sexual misconduct]], all of which he has denied, and the [[statute of limitations]] had by the mid-2010s expired in nearly all cases. Cosby was found guilty of three counts of [[aggravated indecent assault]] and sentenced to three to ten years in prison in September 2018.<ref name="NewYorkTimes">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/arts/television/bill-cosby-sentencing.html |title=Bill Cosby, Once a Model of Fatherhood, Is Sentenced to Prison |last1=Bowely |first1=Graham |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=September 25, 2018 |last2=Coscarelli |first2=Joe |language=en}}</ref><ref name=BBCNews>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45644374|title=Cosby sentenced to prison for sex assault|date=September 25, 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=September 25, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=ABCNews>Francescani, Chris; Hutchinson, Bill (September 25, 2018).

Cosby left Temple to pursue a career in comedy. He lined up stand-up jobs at clubs in Philadelphia and then in [[New York City]], where he appeared at [[The Gaslight Cafe]] beginning in 1961.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |last=Ghare |first=Madhavi |title=Bill Cosby Biography |publisher=Buzzle.com |url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/bill-cosby-biography.html |accessdate=May 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802144531/http://www.buzzle.com/articles/bill-cosby-biography.html |archive-date=August 2, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He booked dates in cities such as [[Chicago]], [[Las Vegas]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] In the summer of 1963, he received national exposure on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.

While many comics of the time were using the growing freedom of that decade to explore controversial and sometimes risqué material, Cosby was making his reputation with humorous recollections of his childhood. Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosby's stories. As Cosby's success grew he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, "A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, 'Yeah, that's the way I see it too.' Okay. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that ''we are alike. Right?''

Seinfeld said of Cosby: "He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story.

In 1965, Cosby was cast alongside [[Robert Culp]] in the ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' espionage adventure series on [[NBC]].

During the series' run, Cosby continued to do stand-up comedy performances and recorded half a dozen record albums for Warner Bros. Records. He also began to dabble in singing, recording ''[[Silver Throat: Bill Cosby Sings]]'' in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} In June 1968, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] reported that Cosby had turned down a five-year, $3.5{{nbsp}}million contract renewal offer and would leave the label in August that year to record for his own record label.<ref>"Cosby to Exit WB in August to Join Own Record Firm", [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']], June 1, 1968, p. 1</ref>

[[Tetragrammaton Records]], a division of the Campbell, Silver, Cosby (CSC) Corporation—the Los Angeles–based production company founded by Cosby, his manager Roy Silver, and filmmaker Bruce Post Campbell—produced films as well as records, including Cosby's television specials, the ''[[Fat Albert]]'' cartoon special and series, and several motion pictures. CSC hired Artie Mogull as President of the label. Tetragrammaton was fairly active during 1968–69 (its most successful signing was British heavy rock band [[Deep Purple]]) but it quickly went into the red and ceased trading during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |title=TetragrammatonAlbum Discography |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/la/tetragrammaton/tetragrammaton.html |accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref>

===1970s: ''Fat Albert'', and ''The Bill Cosby Show''===

[[File:Bill cosby 1969.JPG|thumb|upright|Cosby in 1969]]

Cosby pursued a variety of additional television projects and appeared as a regular guest host on ''The Tonight Show'' and as the star of an annual special for NBC. In 1969, he returned with another series, ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'', a situation comedy that ran for two seasons. Cosby played a physical education teacher at a Los Angeles high school. While only a modest critical success, the show was a ratings hit, finishing eleventh in its first season. Cosby was lauded for using African-American performers such as [[Lillian Randolph]], [[Moms Mabley]], and [[Rex Ingram (actor)|Rex Ingram]] as characters. According to commentary on the Season{{nbsp}}1 DVDs for the show, Cosby was at odds with NBC over his refusal to include a [[laugh track]] in the show, as he felt viewers had the ability to find humor for themselves when watching a TV show.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

After ''The Bill Cosby Show'' left the air, Cosby resumed his formal education. He began graduate work at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. For the [[PBS]] series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]'', Cosby recorded several segments teaching reading skills to young children.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

When Cosby was about 35 years old in 1972, he received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]] and was also back in prime time with a variety series, ''[[The New Bill Cosby Show]]''. However, this show lasted only a season. More successful was a [[Saturday-morning cartoon]], ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', hosted by Cosby and based on his own childhood. That series ran from 1972 to 1979, then ran as ''The New Fat Albert Show'' in 1979, and finally ran as ''The Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids''. In 1984, Cosby wrote a [[dissertation]]: "An Integration of the Visual Media Via 'Fat Albert And The Cosby Kids' into the Elementary School Curriculum as a Teaching Aid and Vehicle to Achieve Increased Learning". This was as partial fulfillment for his 1976 doctorate in education from UMass.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>The first 22 pages of his dissertation are available at the [https://search.proquest.com/docview/302825147 UMI ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts, publication number AAT 7706369]</ref> Subsequently, Temple University granted him his [[bachelor's degree]] on the basis of "life experience".<ref>{{cite web|last=Holznagel|title=From Dropout to Doctorate: A Bill Cosby Educational Timeline |url=http://www.who2.com/blog/2010/12/from-dropout-to-doctorate-a-bill-cosby-educational-timeline |work=Who2 Biographies|accessdate=December 5, 2010}}</ref>

During the 1970s, Cosby and other African-American actors, including [[Sidney Poitier]], joined forces to make some successful [[comedy film]]s to counter the violent "[[blaxploitation]]" films of the era, such as ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'' in 1974; ''[[Let's Do It Again (1975 film)|Let's Do It Again]]'' in 1975; and in 1976, ''[[Mother, Jugs & Speed]]'', co-starring [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Harvey Keitel]]. About this last film, a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reviewer wrote, "Bill Cosby steals the film outright with his hilarious performance as 'Mother', the streetwise seen-it-all [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]."{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1976, Cosby starred in ''[[A Piece of the Action (film)|A Piece of the Action]]'' with Poitier; and ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]]'', a compilation of four [[Neil Simon]] plays. He also hosted ''[[Cos (TV series)|Cos]]'' in 1976. In addition, he produced an hour-long variety show featuring puppets, sketches, and musical numbers. It was during this season that ABC decided to take advantage of this phase of Cosby's career, by joining with [[Filmation]] producers of ''Fat Albert'' to create live-action segments starring Cosby, for the 1964/1971 animated film ''[[Journey Back to Oz]]''; it subsequently aired in syndication. Cosby was also a regular on children's [[Public broadcasting|public television]] programs starting in the 1970s, hosting the "[[Picture Pages]]" segments that lasted into the early 1980s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===1980s: ''The Cosby Show''===

Cosby's greatest television success came in September 1984 with the debut of ''[[The Cosby Show]]''. Cosby, an advocate for family-oriented humor, co-produced the series, held creative control, and involved himself in every aspect of production. Plots were often based on ideas that Cosby suggested while in meetings with the writing staff.<ref name="People Magazine article (December 10, 1984)">{{cite web|title=People Magazine article (December 10, 1984)|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089368,00.html|website=People |accessdate=July 19, 2015}}</ref> The show had parallels to Cosby's actual family life: like the characters [[Cliff Huxtable|Cliff]] and [[Clair Huxtable]], Cosby and his wife [[Camille Cosby|Camille]] were college-educated and financially successful, and they had five children. On the show, Cosby played the role of an [[obstetrician]]. Much of the material from the pilot and first season of ''The Cosby Show'' was taken from his video ''[[Bill Cosby: Himself]]'',{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} released in 1983. The series was an immediate success, debuting near the top of the ratings and staying there for most of its eight-season run.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 1987, Cosby attempted to return to film with the spy spoof ''[[Leonard Part 6]]''. Although Cosby himself was the producer and wrote the story, he realized during production that the film was not going to be what he wanted and publicly denounced it, warning audiences to stay away.<ref name=yahoobio>{{cite web|publisher=Yahoo!

After ''The Cosby Show'' went off the air in 1992, Cosby embarked on a number of other projects, which included a [[revival (television)|revival]] of the classic [[Groucho Marx]] game show ''[[You Bet Your Life#1992 Bill Cosby version|You Bet Your Life]]'' (1992–93), the [[Television movie|TV-movie]] ''[[I Spy Returns]]'' (1994), and ''[[The Cosby Mysteries]]'' (1994). In the mid-1990s, he appeared as a detective in [[black-and-white]] [[film noir]]-themed commercials for [[Turner Classic Movies]]. He made appearances in three more films: ''[[Ghost Dad]]'' (1990), ''[[The Meteor Man (film)|The Meteor Man]]'' (1993), and ''[[Jack (1996 film)|Jack]]'' (1996). In addition, he was interviewed in [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997), a documentary about the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|1963 racist bombing]] of a church in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Also in 1996, he started up a new show for CBS, ''[[Cosby (TV series)|Cosby]]'', again co-starring [[Phylicia Rashād]], his onscreen wife on ''The Cosby Show''. Cosby co-produced the show for [[Carsey-Werner Productions]]. It centered on Cosby as Hilton Lucas, an iconoclastic [[senior citizen]] who tries to find a new job after being [[Layoff|downsized]] and, in the meantime, gets on his wife's nerves. [[Madeline Kahn]] co-starred as Rashād's goofy business partner Pauline. Cosby was hired by CBS to be the official spokesman of its Detroit affiliate [[WWJ-TV]] during an advertising campaign from 1995 to 1998. Cosby also hosted a CBS special, ''[[Kids Say the Darndest Things]]'' on February 6, 1995, which was followed after as a full season show, with Cosby as host, from January 9, 1998, to June 23, 2000.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Tim |last2=Marsh |first2=Earle F. |date=October 17, 2007 |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946–Present |edition=9 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-49773-4 |pages=736–737}}</ref> After four seasons, ''Cosby'' was canceled. Its last episode aired April 28, 2000. ''Kids Say the Darndest Things'' was terminated the same year.

A series for [[preschool]]ers, ''[[Little Bill]]'', created by Cosby as a semi-biographical representation of his childhood growing up in Philadelphia, made its debut on [[Nickelodeon]] in 1999. The network renewed the popular program in November 2000. In 2001, Cosby's agenda included the publication of a new book, as well as delivering the [[commencement address]]es at [[Morris Brown College]],<ref>{{cite news |date=August 2001 |title=Who Were Our 2001 College Commencement Speakers?

Cosby has been the subject of highly publicized accusations of rape, [[drug-facilitated sexual assault]], [[sexual battery]], [[child sexual abuse]], and [[sexual misconduct]], the earliest of which were said by his accusers to have taken place in the mid-1960s. In October 2014, a part of comedian [[Hannibal Buress]]'s comedy routine that described sexual misbehavior by Cosby went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]], resulting in more women coming forward to state that they were assaulted by Cosby.

On June 23, 2020, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Cosby would be able to appeal his sexual assault conviction based upon questions on testimony from a witness being more prejudicial than probative.

==Defamation lawsuit settlement==

In early April 2019, Cosby's home insurance company ([[American International Group|AIG]]) settled a federal defamation lawsuit with seven women accused of lying by Cosby when they accused Cosby of sexual assault, but could no longer bring criminal charges because their allegations were too old. The suit was filed in December 2014, and the settlement terms were not disclosed. The seven women's accusations span decades, from 1969 until 1992. The seven are a subset of more than 60 women who have spoken out accusing Cosby of sexual harassment and/or assault.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-cosby-idUSKCN1RH2AE|title=Bill Cosby settles defamation lawsuit brought by seven women|date=April 6, 2019|agency=[[Reuters]]|access-date=April 7, 2019|language=en}}</ref> A spokesman for Cosby, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby did not settle the case; rather, AIG settled without the "knowledge, permission, and/or consent of Mr. Cosby.

Cosby received an award at the celebration of the 50th anniversary commemoration of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling—a ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] that outlawed [[racial segregation]] in public schools. Later, in May 2004, he made public remarks critical of African-Americans who put higher priorities on sports, fashion, and "acting hard" than on education, self-respect, and self-improvement. He pleaded for African-American families to educate their children on the many different aspects of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Brownfeld |first=Alan |date=June 17, 2013 |title=Father's Day with Bill Cosby, an American Original |publisher=Salem-News.com |url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/june172013/bill-cosby-ab.php |accessdate=June 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Cosby: Charity Work & Causes |publisher=LooktotheStars.org |url=https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/bill-cosby |accessdate= June 26, 2015}}</ref> In the [[Pound Cake speech]], Cosby asked that African-American parents teach their children better morals at a younger age. As reported in ''[[The Washington Times]]'', Cosby "told reporters during a special session of the [[Congressional Black Caucus Foundation]]'s 34th annual legislative conference" that, "Parenting needs to come to the forefront. If you need help and you don't know how to parent, we want to be able to reach out and touch you."<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/sep/9/20040909-121926-4474r/| title= Cosby urges leaders to aid black families| first= Brian | last= DeBose| work= [[The Washington Times]]| date=September 9, 2009 | accessdate= June 26, 2015}}</ref> Richard Leiby of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported, "Bill Cosby was anything but [[politically correct]] in his remarks Monday night at a Constitution Hall bash commemorating the 50th anniversary of the ''Brown v.

Cosby again came under sharp criticism, and was largely unapologetic, for his stance when he made similar remarks during a speech at a July{{nbsp}}1 meeting of the [[Rainbow/PUSH|Rainbow/PUSH Coalition]] that commemorated the anniversary of ''Brown v.

He further described those who needed attention as blacks who "had forgotten the sacrifices of those in the [[Civil Rights Movement]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Fattah Lauds Bill Cosby as 'Hometown Hero' |date=October 26, 2009 |location=Washington DC |url=http://fattah.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=34&sectiontree=32,34&itemid=510 |website=US House of Representatives |publisher=Congressman Chaka Fattah |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602102013/http://fattah.house.gov//index.cfm?sectionid=34 |archivedate=June 2, 2011 |df= }}</ref>

In a 2008 interview, Cosby mentioned [[Philadelphia]]; [[Atlanta]]; [[Chicago]]; [[Detroit]]; [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]]; and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], Massachusetts among the cities where crime was high and young African-American men were being murdered and jailed in disproportionate numbers. Cosby stood his ground against criticism and affirmed that African-American parents were continuing to fail to inculcate proper standards of moral behavior.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/race/2008/06/four-years-ago.html|title=Cosby to blacks: Come on people, it's time for change|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=November 9, 2013 |date=June 2, 2008}}</ref>

Cosby's vocal social comments led to the unsealing of documents in a previous civil suit by a woman who had [[Andrea Constand v. William H. Cosby, Jr.|accused Cosby of sexual assault]], which in turn sparked renewed interest in older allegations. The judge ruled that releasing the sealed documents was justified by the "stark contrast between Bill Cosby, the public moralist and Bill Cosby, the subject of serious allegations concerning improper (and perhaps criminal) conduct".<ref name=MDale>{{cite news|last1=Dale|first1=Maryclaire|title=Cosby admitted in 2005 to getting sedatives to give to women he sought sex with|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/cosby-admitted-in-2005-to-getting-quaaludes-to-give-to-women-he-sought-sex-with/article25330387/|work=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |date=July 7, 2015 |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}</ref>

Cosby has also been vocally critical of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians in regard to their views on socioeconomic and racial issues. In a 2013, [[CNN]] interview regarding [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]], Cosby stated "this Republican Party is not the Republican Party of 1863, of [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[abolitionism|abolitionists]] and [[slavery]], is not good. I think it's important for us to look at the underlying part of it. What is the value of it?

===Autumn Jackson extortion trial===

During [[Autumn Jackson]]'s [[extortion]] trial in July 1997, Cosby testified that he made private payments to Shawn Upshaw, a woman who had briefly been his lover in Las Vegas during the early 1970s. Upshaw later told Cosby that he was the father of her daughter, Autumn Jackson. Cosby denies being the father and said he gave Upshaw a total of about $100,000 because he did not want her to publicly reveal the affair.<ref>{{cite news |first=John J.|last=Goldman |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/16/news/mn-13121|title=Cosby Testifies About Secret Payments |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Company]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=July 16, 1997|accessdate=August 16, 2018}}</ref> The then-22-year-old Jackson was sentenced to 26 months in jail for trying to extort $40&nbsp;million from Cosby. In the trial and subsequent appeal, the courts held that Jackson's belief that she was Cosby's child—even if sincere—was irrelevant to the question of her guilt. The courts stated that the mere fact that she was Cosby's child would not have entitled her to the money, and therefore the demand was extortionate, whether or not she believed herself to be Cosby's daughter.<ref>{{cite news |first=Benjamin |last=Weiser |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/16/nyregion/judges-reinstate-conviction-in-extortion-of-bill-cosby.html|title=Judges Reinstate Conviction In Extortion of Bill Cosby|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=November 16, 1999|accessdate=August 16, 2018 }}</ref> Although both Jackson and Cosby stated at various times that they were willing to undergo [[DNA testing]] to determine Jackson's paternity, the two sides never reached an agreement as to when and how to perform the test.
