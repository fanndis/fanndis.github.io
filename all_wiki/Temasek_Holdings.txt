Temasek differs from many [[sovereign wealth fund]]s because it invests mostly in equities, is the outright owner of many assets, and pays taxes like other commercial investment firms.<ref>{{cite web

==History==

===Incorporation===
At the point of [[History of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|Singapore's independence]] in August 1965, the [[Government of Singapore]] had ownership or joint ownership of various local companies, such as [[Malaysia-Singapore Airlines]] (later split up into [[Malaysia Airlines]] and [[Singapore Airlines]]) and the Singapore Telephone Board (which became [[Singapore Telecommunications]]). As part of its push for local and foreign private investment in sectors such as manufacturing and shipbuilding, the government's [[Economic Development Board]] (EDB) also bought minority stakes in a variety of local companies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Singapore - Our History - The Sixties|url=http://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/why-singapore/about-singapore/our-history/1960s.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006094315/http://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/why-singapore/about-singapore/our-history/1960s.html|archive-date=6 October 2012}}</ref> During the first ten years after independence, the government acquired or established several companies, such as the [[Keppel Corporation]] (originally Keppel Shipyard, taken over from the [[Royal Navy]] after the British military withdrawal from Singapore), [[ST Engineering]] (originally a weapon manufacturer set up to supply the [[Singapore Armed Forces]]), and the shipping company [[Neptune Orient Lines]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

On 25 June 1974, Temasek was incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act<ref name="temasek-incorporated" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Singapore Statutes Online - 50 - Companies Act|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Ac3063e4b-61ed-4faf-8014-fabd5b998ed7%20%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231145749/http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Ac3063e4b-61ed-4faf-8014-fabd5b998ed7%20%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0|archive-date=31 December 2012}}</ref> to hold and manage the assets previously held directly by the Singapore government. The goal was for Temasek to own and manage these investments on a commercial basis,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=29 July 2009|title=Speeches by Ho Ching, Executive Director & CEO, at the Institute of Policy Studies|url=http://www.temasek.com.sg/mediacentre/speeches?detailid=8600|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102150707/http://www.temasek.com.sg/mediacentre/speeches?detailid=8600|archive-date=2 November 2013}}</ref> allowing the [[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Ministry of Finance]] and the [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Singapore)|Ministry of Trade and Industry]] to focus on policymaking.

===Status===
Temasek is a company incorporated in Singapore, and operates under the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act. It is neither a government agency nor a [[Statutory boards of the Singapore Government|statutory board]]. Like any other commercial company, Temasek pays [[tax]]es that contributes to government revenue in the countries it operates in, distributes dividends to its shareholder and has its own board of directors and a professional management team. Its sole shareholder is Singapore's Ministry of Finance.

Temasek is designated a Fifth Schedule<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.modernmeadow.com/press-release/modern-meadow-series-b-press-release/|title=Modern Meadow Closes $40M Series B Round to Commercialize Biofabricated Leather - Modern Meadow|work=Modern Meadow|access-date=21 July 2017}}</ref> entity under the Singapore Constitution, which imposes certain safeguards to protect the government's past reserves. For instance, the approval of the President of Singapore is required for any transaction which is likely to result in a draw-down of Temasek's cash reserves.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-smrt-corp-m-a-temasek-holdings-idUSKCN11Z1L9|title=Shareholders approve Temasek buyout of Singapore rail operator|date=29 September 2016|work=Reuters|access-date=21 July 2017}}</ref> The president also has the right to appoint, terminate, or renew the members of Temasek's board of directors. In most other respects, however, Temasek operates as an independent commercial investment holding company.

In a 2009 speech,<ref name=":0" /> [[Ho Ching]], Temasek Holdings' Executive Director and CEO, said that the company had made an effort to instill discipline and professionalism, and to be tested and measured by providing public markers of performance.  She noted that Temasek's bonds spreads and credit ratings have been regularly<ref>{{Cite web|date=18 April 2013|title=Moody's affirms Temasek's Aaa rating|url=https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-affirms-Temaseks-Aaa-rating--PR_271122|website=Moody's}}</ref> and independently<ref>{{Cite news|title = S&P CONFIRMS AAA RATING AS TEMASEK UPSIZES GLOBAL NOTES TO US$15 BILLION|date = 15 July 2013|url = http://asiatoday.com.au/content/sp-confirms-aaa-rating-temasek-upsizes-global-notes-us15-billion}}</ref> monitored as public markers of Temasek's financial position and credit risks.

===Initial holdings===
Temasek's initial portfolio of S$354 million comprised shares previously held by the Singapore Government, including a [[Jurong Bird Park|bird park]], a hotel, a shoe maker, a detergent producer, naval yards converted into a ship repair business, a start-up airline, and an iron and steel mill.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chart of the Day: Temasek’s major stock investments yielded 8.1%|url=https://sbr.com.sg/markets-investing/news/chart-day-temaseks-major-stock-investments-yielded-81|website=Singapore Business Review}}</ref>

===Stake Buy===
In June 2018, Temasek invested S$340 million in a minority stake in UST Global, a digital technology services company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/temasek-invests-340m-in-ust-global|title=Temasek invests $340m in UST Global|last=hermes|date=2018-06-28|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}</ref> The size of the stake was not disclosed.

Temasek purchased 30 per cent of Haldor Topsoe’s shares in March 2019. The investment company was selected in recognition of the value that it would add through its deep insights and connections in Asian growth and other emerging markets, according to the Danish engineering firm.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Haldor Topsøe Holding A/S sells minority stake to Temasek|url=https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/03/12/1751600/0/en/Haldor-Tops%C3%B8e-Holding-A-S-sells-minority-stake-to-Temasek.html|website=GlobeNewsWire}}</ref> The transaction price was not disclosed.

In August 2020, Temasek Holdings added a 3.9 per cent stake in BlackRock Inc, worth about US$3.5 billion, becoming one of its largest shareholders.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Temasek buys stake worth US$3.5b in BlackRock|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/temasek-buys-stake-worth-us35b-in-blackrock|website=The Business Times}}</ref> According to people familiar with the matter, Temasek was one of several players that bought the money manager’s shares when PNC Financial Services Group Inc. sold a US$14 billion stake earlier in the year.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Temasek Holdings adds 3.9% stake in BlackRock for US$3.5 bil; becomes one of BlackRock's largest shareholders|url=https://www.theedgesingapore.com/news/company-news/temasek-holdings-adds-39-stake-blackrock-us35-bil-becomes-one-blackrocks-largest|website=The Edge Singapore}}</ref>

==Controversy==

===Purchase of Shin Corporation===
{{Main|Sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings}}

Temasek's 2006 acquisition of [[Shin Corporation]], owned by the family of then Thai prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], was particularly controversial, with protestors burning effigies of Lee and Ho on the streets of Bangkok.<ref name="asiamedia">[http://www.international.ucla.edu/cnes/article/41204 Thailand: Protesters burn images of Lee, wife. Bangkok Post], 18 March 2006.</ref> The deal was a factor in exacerbating the [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006|Thai political crisis]], which eventually led to the downfall of Thaksin and a review of the transaction's legality. The [[CDRM|military junta]] that overthrew Thaksin later tried unsuccessfully to force Temasek to divest a large part of its investment in Shin Corp.<ref>[http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=337&Itemid=32 Thailand Moves Against Foreign Firms], Asia Sentinel, 10 January 2007</ref> As of 2015, Temasek's stake in [[Intouch Holdings|Intouch Corporation]] (as Shin Corporation was renamed) had reduced to 42%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.temasekreview.com.sg/major-investments/telecommunications-media-and-technology.html#table|title=Temasek Review|date=4 July 2015|publisher=Temasek|access-date=21 October 2015}}</ref>
