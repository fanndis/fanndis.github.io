'''Crispin Beltran''', also known as '''Ka Bel''' (January 7, 1933 – May 20, 2008) was a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] [[Labor Movement|labor]] leader. A staunch critic of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], his imprisonment in 2006 and 2007 on disputed charges of rebellion and sedition drew international attention. He was a member of [[13th Congress of the Philippines]] with the [[Anakpawis]] ("Toiling Masses") [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list]] and former chair of [[Kilusang Mayo Uno]] (KMU), a militant and progressive labor movement.

==Labor leader==
Beltran began his labor career in his 20s when he served as the president of the Yellow Taxi Drivers’ Union and the Amalgamated Taxi Drivers Federation from 1955 to 1963. He served as vice administrator of the Confederation of Labor Unions of the Philippines and was vice president of the Philippine Alliance of Nationalist Organizations from 1963 to 1972.

In August 1982 to 1984, he was arrested and detained at [[Camp Crame]], [[Quezon City]], and his 10 children lived on his small earnings from selling rubber slippers and selling fish in the market. Osang delivered his speeches at rallies, and eventually did volunteer work at the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines.

In 1984, when KMU president Felixberto Olalia died of [[pneumonia]] in his detention cell, Ka Osang successfully planned a daring escape plan amid his [[kidney]] ailment, but he endured blows, punches and kicks from his guards. Beltran became a fugitive of justice in Central Luzon, and was protected by insurgents.

In 1986 President [[Corazon Aquino]] ordered the release of Beltran and of all political prisoners. He joined the party-list elections as a second nominee of Bayan Muna in 2001 and won a seat in the House of Representatives. He won a second term in 2004 and a third term in 2007 as [[Anakpawis]] representative.<ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net">{{Cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/|title=Philippines Top Stories: Politics, Environment, Education, Trending {{!}} Inquirer.net|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|language=en|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>

Beltran joined the [[Kilusang Mayo Uno]] in 1955. He became the Chairperson of the organization in 1986 following the murder of [[Rolando Olalia]]. From 1993 to 1999, Beltran was the Chairperson of [[BAYAN]].

==Detention and release==

On February 25, 2006, Beltran was arrested shortly after a [[2006 state of emergency in the Philippines|state of emergency]] was declared by [[President of the Philippines|President]] Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He was charged with inciting to sedition. He was subsequently implicated in an alleged plot to overthrow the government of Arroyo.<ref name="supremecourt.gov.ph">[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2007/june2007/172070-72.htm ''Beltran v.
