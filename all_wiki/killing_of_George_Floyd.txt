=== State investigations and criminal charges ===
On May 29, 2020, Chauvin was charged with [[third-degree murder]] and second-degree [[manslaughter]], and held at [[Minnesota Correctional Facility – Oak Park Heights|Oak Park Heights state prison]]. According to the criminal complaint, police are trained that the neck restraint that he applied "with a subject in prone position is inherently dangerous".<ref name=cbslocal_20200529_derek>{{Cite web |work=CBS Minnesota|url=https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/29/derek-chauvin-arrested-george-floyd-death-minneapolis-police-officer/ |title=Former MPD Officer Derek Chauvin In Custody, Charged With Murder In George Floyd's Death |date=May 29, 2020|access-date=May 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200529173202/https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/29/derek-chauvin-arrested-george-floyd-death-minneapolis-police-officer/|archive-date=May 29, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> On June 3, 2020, the charge against Chauvin was upgraded to [[second-degree murder]], and the three other officers were charged with [[aiding and abetting]] second-degree murder.<ref name=cbslocal_20200603_george>{{Cite web |url=https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/06/03/george-floyd-death-derek-chauvins-murder-charge-upgraded-to-2nd-degree-unintentional-murder-3-other-officers-charged/ |title=George Floyd Death: All Four Ex-Officers Involved Now Charged, In Custody |website=CBS Minnesota |date=June 3, 2020|access-date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603211009/https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/06/03/george-floyd-death-derek-chauvins-murder-charge-upgraded-to-2nd-degree-unintentional-murder-3-other-officers-charged/|archive-date=June 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|
According to [[Mitchell Hamline School of Law|Mitchell Hamline]] law professor Ted Sampsell-Jones, Chauvin was charged with second-degree [[felony murder]], not second-degree intentional murder, which is possible because Minnesota is one of only two jurisdictions that rejects the [[Lesser included offense|merger doctrine]] and allows the use of [[assault]] as a predicate felony.<ref name="Sampsell-Jones">{{cite news |last1=Sampsell-Jones |first1=Ted |title=Explaining the New Second Degree Murder Charge Against Derek Chauvin |url=https://thedispatch.com/p/explaining-the-new-second-degree |access-date=June 23, 2020 |work=The Dispatch |date=June 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622010707/https://thedispatch.com/p/explaining-the-new-second-degree |archive-date=June 22, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> While a charge of second-degree intentional murder could have exposed Chauvin under state sentencing guidelines to the possibility of a presumptive sentence as long as 306 months, second-degree felony murder carries the same presumptive sentence as the previous charge of third-degree murder: 180 months.<ref name="Sampsell-Jones" /> Another issue with invoking the felony murder doctrine is that Minnesota law allows the trial court judge to make the requisite finding that the predicate felony posed a "special danger to human life", which may conflict with [[Apprendi v. New Jersey|federal case law]] requiring every fact essential to a criminal sentence to be submitted to the jury at trial.<ref name="Sampsell-Jones" />

=== Civil litigation ===
The family of George Floyd filed a lawsuit in federal court in July 2020 against the City of Minneapolis and the four former police officers involved in the killing. The complaint said Floyd's [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights were violated by "excessive use of unjustified, excessive, illegal, and deadly force". The lawsuit did not specify the amount of monetary damages the family sought.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Treisman |first1=Rachel |last2=Dwyer |first2=Colin |date=July 15, 2020 |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/07/15/891221766/floyd-family-attorneys-to-announce-a-civil-lawsuit-against-minneapolis-and-polic |title=George Floyd's Family Files Civil Lawsuit Against Minneapolis And Police, Lawyers Say |work=NPR }}</ref>

===Criminal proceedings===
On August 29, 2020, attorneys for Derek Chauvin filed a motion for dismissal, claiming that Floyd most likely died as a result of drug use and preexisting medical conditions. On the same day, prosecutors moved to increase potential sentences for the four officers beyond the guidelines for all four accused, arguing that Floyd was vulnerable while being held down on the ground in handcuffs and was treated cruelly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/08/29/minneapolis-officer-derek-chauvin-seeks-dismissal-george-floyd-murder-charges/5669077002/|title=Derek Chauvin, former officer accused in George Floyd's death, wants murder charges dismissed|first=Doug|last=Stanglin|website=USA TODAY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/derek-chauvin-seeking-dismissal-of-charges-in-george-floyd-case-report|title=Derek Chauvin seeking dismissal of charges in George Floyd case: reports|first=Dom|last=Calicchio|date=August 30, 2020|website=Fox News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/29/us/george-floyd-killing-officer-dismissal/index.html|title=Former officer in George Floyd killing asks judge to dismiss charges |first=Andy |last=Rose |website=CNN}}</ref> Despite dismissing the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, the presiding judge also tossed Chauvin's motion to dismiss the more serious second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.<ref name="CNN20201022" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Bailey|first=Holly|date=2020-10-22|title=Judge dismisses third-degree murder charge against officer in George Floyd's death; upholds more serious charge|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-dismisses-third-degree-murder-charge-against-officer-in-george-floyds-death-upholds-more-serious-charge/2020/10/22/3f3a1cce-1490-11eb-ad6f-36c93e6e94fb_story.html|access-date=2020-10-27|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> The trial of the four officers is scheduled to start on March 8, 2021.<ref name=trialdate>{{cite news|url=https://www.fox9.com/news/judge-orders-1-trial-for-4-officers-charged-in-george-floyds-death|title=Judge orders 1 trial for 4 officers charged in George Floyd's death|first=Allie|last=Johnson|publisher=Fox 9 News|date=November 5, 2020|access-date=November 5, 2020}}</ref>
