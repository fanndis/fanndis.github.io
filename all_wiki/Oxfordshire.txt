'''Oxfordshire''' (abbreviated '''Oxon''', from ''Oxonium'', the [[Latin]] name for [[Oxford]]) is a landlocked [[county]] in [[South East England]]. The [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial]] county borders [[Warwickshire]] to the north-west, [[Northamptonshire]] to the north-east, [[Buckinghamshire]] to the east, [[Berkshire]] to the south, [[Wiltshire]] to the south-west and [[Gloucestershire]] to the west.

The county has major education and tourist industries and is noted for concentrations of performance motorsport, car manufacturing and technology companies. [[Oxford University Press]] is the largest firm among a concentration of print and publishing firms; the [[University of Oxford]] is also linked to the concentration of local [[biotechnology]] companies.

As well as the city of [[Oxford]], other centres of population are [[Banbury]], [[Bicester]], [[Kidlington]] and [[Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire|Chipping Norton]] to the north of Oxford; [[Carterton, Oxfordshire|Carterton]] and [[Witney]] to the west; [[Thame]] and [[Chinnor]] to the east; and [[Abingdon-on-Thames]], [[Wantage]], [[Didcot]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] and [[Henley-on-Thames]] to the south. The areas south of the Thames, the [[Vale of White Horse]] and parts of [[South Oxfordshire]], are in the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Berkshire]], as is the highest point, the {{convert|261|m}} [[White Horse Hill]].<ref name=Countytops>{{cite web | url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/CountyTops.php?ct=EWM | title=County and Unitary Authority Tops | publisher=The Mountains of England and Wales | first=Simon | last=Edwardes | accessdate=14 December 2015 | year=2001 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222095151/http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/CountyTops.php?ct=EWM | archive-date=22 December 2015 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Oxfordshire}}
Oxfordshire was recorded as a county in the early years of the 10th century and lies between the [[River Thames]] to the south, the [[Cotswolds]] to the west, the [[Chilterns]] to the east and the Midlands to the north, with spurs running south to [[Henley-on-Thames]] and north to [[Banbury]].

Although it had some significance as an area of valuable agricultural land in the centre of the country, it was largely ignored by the Romans, and did not grow in importance until the formation of a settlement at Oxford in the 8th century. [[Alfred the Great]] was born across the Thames in Wantage, Vale of White Horse. The University of Oxford was founded in 1096, though its collegiate structure did not develop until later on. The university in the county town of [[Oxford]] (whose name came from [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Oxenaford'' = "ford for [[oxen]]") grew in importance during the Middle Ages and early modern period. The area was part of the [[Cotswolds]] wool trade from the 13th century, generating much wealth, particularly in the western portions of the county in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds. [[Morris Motors]] was founded in Oxford in 1912, bringing heavy industry to an otherwise agricultural county. The importance of agriculture as an employer declined rapidly in the 20th century; currently{{when|date=October 2020}} under one percent of the county's population are involved due to high mechanisation.{{cn|date=October 2020}} Nonetheless, Oxfordshire remains a very agricultural county by land use, with a lower population than neighbouring Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, which are both smaller.

Throughout most of its history the county was divided into fourteen [[hundred (division)|hundreds]], namely [[Bampton, Oxfordshire|Bampton]], [[Banbury (hundred)|Banbury]], [[Binfield]], [[Bloxham]], [[Bullingdon (hundred)|Bullingdon]], [[Chadlington (hundred)|Chadlington]], [[Dorchester (hundred)|Dorchester]], [[Ewelme]], [[Langtree (hundred)|Langtree]], [[Lewknor]], [[Pyrton]], [[Ploughley]], [[Thame (hundred)|Thame]] and [[Wootton, West Oxfordshire|Wootton]].

The [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]], the main army unit in the area, was based at [[Cowley Barracks]] on Bullingdon Green, [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]].

The [[Vale of White Horse]] district and parts of the [[South Oxfordshire]] administrative district south of the River Thames were historically part of [[Berkshire]], but in 1974 [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], [[Didcot]], [[Faringdon]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] and [[Wantage]] were added to the administrative county of Oxfordshire under the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Conversely, the [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]] area of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], now administratively in [[Berkshire]], was historically part of Oxfordshire as was the parish of [[Stokenchurch]], now administratively in [[Buckinghamshire]]. The areas of [[Oxford]] city south of the Thames such as [[Grandpont]] were transferred much earlier, in 1889.

== Geography ==

Oxfordshire includes parts of three [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. In the north-west lie the [[Cotswolds]], to the south and south-east are the open chalk hills of the [[North Wessex Downs]] and wooded hills of the [[Chilterns]]. The north of the county contains the ironstone of the Cherwell uplands. Long-distance walks within the county include the [[Ridgeway National Trail]], [[Macmillan Way]], [[Oxfordshire Way]] and the D’Arcy Dalton Way.

=== Extreme points ===

* '''Northernmost point''': {{coord|52|10|6.58|N|1|19|54.92|W|region:GB|display=inline}}, near Claydon Hay Farm, [[Claydon, Oxfordshire|Claydon]]
* '''Southernmost point''': {{coord|51|27|34.74|N|0|56|48.3|W|region:GB|display=inline}}, near Thames and Kennet Marina, [[Playhatch]]
* '''Westernmost point''': {{coord|51|46|59.73|N|1|43|9.68|W|region:GB|display=inline}}, near Downs Farm, [[Westwell, Oxfordshire|Westwell]]
* '''Easternmost point''': {{coord|51|30|14.22|N|0|52|13.99|W|region:GB|display=inline}}, River Thames, near [[Lower Shiplake]]

=== Rivers ===
The central part of Oxfordshire contains the River Thames with its flat floodplains; the river forms the [[Historic counties of England|historic]] county boundary with [[Berkshire]]. The [[Thames Path]] National Trail parallels the river as it crosses Oxfordshire, continuing towards London. There are many smaller rivers that feed into the Thames such as the [[River Thame|Thame]], [[River Windrush|Windrush]], [[River Evenlode|Evenlode]] and [[River Cherwell|Cherwell]]. Some of these rivers have trails running along their valleys. The [[Oxford Canal]] follows the Cherwell from Banbury to Kidlington.

===Green belt===
{{further|Oxford Green Belt}}
Oxfordshire contains a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] area that fully envelops the city of Oxford, and extends for some miles to afford a protection to surrounding towns and villages from inappropriate development and urban growth. Its border in the east extends to the Buckinghamshire county boundary, while part of its southern border is shared with the North Wessex Downs [[AONB]]. It was first drawn up in the 1950s, and all the county's districts contain some portion of the belt.

==Politics==
The [[Oxfordshire County Council]], since 2013 under [[no overall control]], is responsible for the most strategic [[local government]] functions, including schools, county roads, and [[social services]]. The county is divided into five [[Non-metropolitan district|local government districts]]: [[Oxford]], [[Cherwell (district)|Cherwell]], [[Vale of White Horse]] (after the [[Uffington White Horse]]), [[West Oxfordshire]] and [[South Oxfordshire]], which deal with such matters as [[town and country planning]], waste collection, and housing.

In the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]], Oxfordshire was the only English county as a whole to vote to remain in the European Union by a significant margin, at 57.06% (70.27% in the City of Oxford), despite Cherwell (barely) voting to leave at 50.31%.

==Education==
{{See also|List of schools in Oxfordshire}}

[[File:Chemistry Research Laboratory Atrium.JPG|thumb|The University of Oxford's Chemistry Research Laboratory.]]
Oxfordshire has a completely comprehensive education system with 23 independent schools, including the notable [[Radley College]], and 35 state secondary schools. Only eight schools do not have a [[sixth form]]; these are mostly in South Oxfordshire and Cherwell districts.

The county has two universities: the ancient [[University of Oxford]] and the modern [[Oxford Brookes University]], which are both located in Oxford. In addition, [[Wroxton College]], located in [[Banbury]], is affiliated with [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] of [[New Jersey]].

==Buildings==
[[File:The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|[[The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay]], a ‘textbook’ example of the English medieval [[manor house]].]]
The "dreaming spires" of the buildings of the University of Oxford are among the reasons for Oxford being the sixth most visited city in the United Kingdom for international visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxford.gov.uk/PageRender/decC/Economic_statistics_occw.htm|title=Economic Statistics|publisher=Oxford City Council|accessdate=8 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217215028/http://www.oxford.gov.uk/PageRender/decC/Economic_statistics_occw.htm|archive-date=17 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Among many notable University buildings are the [[Sheldonian Theatre]], built 1664–68 to the design of [[Sir Christopher Wren]], and the [[Radcliffe Camera]], built 1737–49 to the design of [[James Gibbs]].

[[Blenheim Palace]] close to [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]] was built by the great architect [[John Vanbrugh]] for [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], after he had won the [[battle of Blenheim]]. The gardens, which can be visited, were designed by the landscape gardener [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown|"Capability Brown"]], who planted the trees in the battle formation of the victorious army. In the palace, which can also be visited by the public, Sir [[Winston Churchill]] was born in 1874.

[[Chastleton House]], on the Gloucestershire and Warwickshire borders, is a great [[English country house|country mansion]] built on property bought from [[Robert Catesby]], who was one of the men involved in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] with [[Guy Fawkes]]. [[Stonor Park]], another country mansion, has belonged to the [[Recusancy|recusant]] Stonor family for centuries.

[[Mapledurham House]] is an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] stately home in the far south-east of the county, close to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].

[[The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay|The Abbey]] in [[Sutton Courtenay]] is a medieval [[courtyard house]]. It has been recognised by the [[Historic buildings council|Historic Building Council for England]] (now [[Historic England]]) as a building of outstanding historic and [[architecture|architectural]] interest.<ref name=abbeyarchives>The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay archives.</ref> It is considered to be a ‘textbook’ example of the English medieval [[manor house]],{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} and is a [[listed building#Grade I|Grade I-listed]] building.<ref name=listed>{{NHLE|num=1052729|desc=The Abbey|accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>
