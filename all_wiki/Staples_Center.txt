'''Staples Center''' (officially stylized as '''STAPLES Center''') is a multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. Adjacent to the [[L.A. Live]] development, it is located next to the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] complex along [[Figueroa Street]]. The arena opened on October 17, 1999.

It is owned and operated by the Arturo L.A. Arena Company and [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]]. The arena is home venue to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), and the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA). The [[Los Angeles Avengers]] of the [[Arena Football League]] (AFL) and the [[South Bay Lakers|Los Angeles D-Fenders]] of the [[NBA G League|NBA D-League]] were also tenants; the Avengers were folded in 2009, and the D-Fenders moved to the Lakers' practice facility at the [[Toyota Sports Center]] in [[El Segundo, California]] for the 2011–12 season.<ref name = "LASportsCouncil">{{cite web|publisher=Los Angeles Sports Council|title=L.A.

Staples Center is the venue of the [[Grammy Award]]s ceremony and will host the basketball competition during the [[2028 Summer Olympics]].

On August 24, 2020, a day the city of Los Angeles designated [[Kobe Bryant Day]] to honor former Lakers guard [[Kobe Bryant]] who [[2020 Calabasas helicopter crash|died in a helicopter crash]] in January of that year, the City of Los Angeles announced that Figueroa Street between Olympic and Martin Luther King Jr., which includes the area Staples Center is on, will be renamed Kobe Bryant Boulevard.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kobe Bryant Boulevard: Part of Figueroa St outside Staples Center to be renamed after Lakers legend |url=https://abc7.com/kobe-bryant-boulevard-staples-center-figueroa-street-day/6386782/ |website=ABC7.com}}</ref>

; Secret tunnel
On January 15, 2018, in the aftermath of an NBA basketball game between the [[Houston Rockets]] and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], point guard [[Chris Paul]] utilized a secret tunnel (connecting the away team's locker room to the backdoor of the Clippers locker room) to confront former Clipper teammates [[Austin Rivers]] and [[Blake Griffin]]. Blake Griffin reportedly called LAPD screaming "Come quick! Chris Paul is trying to beat me up!". Paul was joined by teammates, [[Trevor Ariza]], [[James Harden]], and [[Gerald Green]] to confront the opponents, which only resulted in verbal altercations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/harden-paul-rockets-teammates-reportedly-entered-clippers-locker-room-after-game/|title=Report: Chris Paul, other Rockets entered Clippers locker room after testy game|first=Colin|last= Ward-Henninger|date=Jan 16, 2018|accessdate=July 1, 2019|work=CBS Sports}}</ref>

Long before construction broke ground, plans for the arena were negotiated between elected city officials and [[real estate]] developers [[Edward P. Roski]] of [[Majestic Realty Co.|Majestic Realty]] and [[Philip Anschutz]].<ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/10/magazine/tm-20652|title=Six Who Made It Happen|last=WHARTON|first=DAVID|date=1999-10-10|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-16|last2=NORWOOD|first2=ROBYN|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> Roski and Anschutz had acquired the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in 1995 and in 1996 began looking for a new home for their team, which then played at the Forum in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1996-12-04/local/me-5629_1_city-council|title=Council Expected to Be Given Plan for Arena Ticket Levy|last=MERL|first=JEAN|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2009/08/20090803/SBJ-In-Depth/Staples-Becomes-A-Beacon-For-Urban-Renewal.aspx|title=Staples becomes a beacon for urban renewal|website=www.sportsbusinessdaily.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref>

Majestic Realty Co. and [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG]] were scouring the Los Angeles area for available land to develop an arena when they were approached by [[Steve Soboroff]], then president of the LA Recreation and Parks Commission. Soboroff requested that they consider building the arena in [[downtown Los Angeles]] adjacent to the convention center. This proposal intrigued Roski and Anschutz, and soon a plan to develop the arena, the current Staples Center, was devised.<ref name=":12" />

Months of negotiations ensued between Anschutz and city officials, with Roski and John Semcken of Majestic Realty Co. spearheading the negotiations for the real estate developers. The negotiations grew contentious at times and the real estate developers threatened to pull out altogether on more than one occasion.<ref name=":12" /> The main opposition came from Councilman [[Joel Wachs]], who opposed utilizing public funds to subsidize the proposed project,<ref name=":02" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/28/news/mn-26592|title=Arena Developers Adopt a Strategy of Disclosure|last=ROHRLICH|first=TED|date=1997-08-28|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> and councilwoman [[Rita Walters]], who objected to parts of it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-16/news/mn-19146_1_sports-arena|title=Council Endorses Deal to Build Sports Arena|last=MERL|first=JEAN|date=1997-01-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

Ultimately, the developers and city leaders reached an agreement, and in 1997, construction broke ground on the new building, which opened two years later. It was financed privately at a cost of US$375 million and is named for the office-supply company [[Staples, Inc.]], which was one of the center's corporate sponsors that paid for [[naming rights]].<ref name="LASportsCouncil" /> The arena opened on October 17, 1999, with a [[Bruce Springsteen]] & The [[E Street Band]] concert as its inaugural event.

During the late summer of 2010, modifications were made to the arena, including refurbished locker rooms for the Clippers, Kings, and Lakers and the installation of a new US$10 million [[High-definition video|HD]] center-hung video scoreboard and [[jumbotron]], replacing the original one that had been in place since the building opened in 1999.<ref name="Live4HD3">{{cite news|url=http://www.staplescenter.com/doublecol.php?section=about&page=news_article&news_id=942|title=Staples Center unveils Live 4HD scoreboard system by Panasonic|date=September 22, 2010|accessdate=October 18, 2010|publisher=staplescenter.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128075308/http://staplescenter.com/doublecol.php?section=about&page=news_article&news_id=942|archivedate=November 28, 2010}}</ref> The [[Panasonic]] Live 4HD scoreboard was officially unveiled on September 22, 2010, as AEG and Staples Center executives, as well as player representatives from the Clippers ([[Craig Smith (basketball, born 1983)|Craig Smith]]), Kings ([[Matt Greene]]), and Lakers ([[Sasha Vujacic]]) were on hand for the presentation.

Following the sudden death of former basketball player [[Kobe Bryant]] in January 2020, a number of media outlets picked up on a phrase used by some, referring to the stadium as "The House That Kobe Built",<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ortiz |first1=Aimee |title=Kobe Bryant Is Honored at the Grammys With Tributes and Jerseys |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/arts/music/grammys-kobe-bryant.html |accessdate=1 February 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=26 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tributes Planned for an Emotional Night in the House That Kobe Built |url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/sports/kobe-bryant-staples-center-lakers-helicopter-crash-nba/2301784/ |accessdate=1 February 2020 |work=NBC Los Angeles}}</ref> due to his historic 20-year career with the Lakers.
