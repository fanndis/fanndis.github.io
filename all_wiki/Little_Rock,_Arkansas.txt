'''Little Rock''' is the [[Capital city|capital]] and most populous city of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arkansas]]. As the [[county seat]] of [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski County]], the city was incorporated on November 7, 1831, on the south bank of the [[Arkansas River]] close to the state's geographic center. The city derived its name from a rock formation along the river, named [[The Little Rock|the "Little Rock"]] ([[French language|French]]: ''La Petite Roche'') by the French explorer [[Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe]] in the 1720s. The capital of the [[Arkansas Territory]] was moved to Little Rock from [[Arkansas Post, Arkansas|Arkansas Post]] in 1821. The city's population was 197,312 in 2019 according to the [[United States Census Bureau]]. The six-county [[Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway, AR Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA) is ranked 78th in terms of population in the United States with 738,344 residents according to the 2017 estimate by the [[United States Census Bureau]].<ref name="wwwcensusgov">{{cite web |title=U.S. Census website |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2014-06-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/feb/10/census-data-arkansas-released/?latest |title=Census shows overall state population up 9.1 percent|publisher=Arkansasonline.com|date=2011-02-10|accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref>

Little Rock is a cultural, economic, government, and transportation center within Arkansas and [[Southern United States|the South]]. Several cultural institutions are in Little Rock, such as the [[Arkansas Arts Center]], the [[Arkansas Repertory Theatre]], and the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra, in addition to hiking, boating, and other outdoor recreational opportunities. Little Rock's history is available through history museums, historic districts or neighborhoods like the [[Quapaw Quarter]], and historic sites such as [[Little Rock Central High School]]. The city is the headquarters of [[Dillard's]], [[Windstream Communications]], [[LiveRamp|Acxiom]], [[Stephens Inc.]], [[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]], [[Heifer International]], [[Winrock International]], the [[Clinton Foundation]], and the [[Rose Law Firm]]. Other corporations, such as [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Dassault Falcon Jet]], [[LM Wind Power]], [[Simmons Bank]], [[Euronet Worldwide]], [[AT&T]], and [[Entergy]] have large operations in the city. State government is a large employer, with many offices downtown. Two major Interstate highways, [[Interstate 30]] and [[Interstate 40]], meet in Little Rock, with the Port of Little Rock serving as a shipping hub.

==Etymology==
Little Rock derives its name from a small rock formation on the south bank of the [[Arkansas River]] called the "Little Rock" (French: ''La Petite Roche''). The Little Rock was used by early river traffic as a landmark and became a well-known river crossing. The Little Rock is across the river from The Big Rock, a large bluff at the edge of the river, which was once used as a rock quarry.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Historical City |publisher=City of Little Rock |url=http://www.littlerock.org/citymanager/divisions/cityclerksoffice/ourhistoricalcity.aspx |accessdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Little Rock, Arkansas|History of Arkansas}}
{{Expand section|date=April 2019}}

[[Archeological]] artifacts provide evidence of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] inhabiting Central Arkansas for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. The early inhabitants may have been the [[Folsom tradition|Folsom]] people, Bluff Dwellers, and [[Mississippian culture]] peoples who built [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] mounds recorded in 1541 by [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[explorer]] [[Hernando de Soto]]. Historical tribes of the area were the [[Caddo]], [[Quapaw]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Choctaw]], and [[Cherokee]].

Little Rock was named for a stone outcropping on the bank of the [[Arkansas River]] used by early travelers as a landmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansas.com/things-to-do/history-heritage/colorful-names/ |title=Colorful Names |publisher=Arkansas Department of Parks & Tourism |accessdate=14 July 2014 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124055328/http://www.arkansas.com/things-to-do/history-heritage/colorful-names/ |archivedate=November 24, 2013 }}</ref> It was named in 1722 by French explorer and [[Merchant|trader]] [[Bernard de la Harpe|Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe]], marked the transition from the flat [[Mississippi Delta]] region to the [[Ouachita Mountains|Ouachita Mountain]] foothills. Travelers referred to the area as the "Little Rock." Though there was an effort to officially name the city "Arkopolis" upon its founding in the 1820s, and that name did appear on a few maps made by the [[US Geological Survey]], the name Little Rock is eventually what stuck.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYolAQAAMAAJ&q=little+rock+arkopolis&pg=RA1-PA61|title=The Hyde Park Historical Record|date=December 29, 2017|publisher=Hyde Park Historical Society|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRCLFU_855UC&q=arkopolis&pg=PA5|title=Historic Little Rock: An Illustrated History|first=C.

==Geography==
Little Rock is located at {{Coord|34|44|10|N|92|19|52|W|type:city}} (34.736009, −92.331122).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2011-04-23 |date=2011-02-12 |title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990 }}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|116.8|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|116.2|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.6|sqmi}} (0.52%) is water.

Little Rock is located on the south bank of the [[Arkansas River]] in Central Arkansas. Fourche Creek and Rock Creek run through the city, and flow into the river. The western part of the city is located in the foothills of the [[Ouachita Mountains]]. Northwest of the city limits are Pinnacle Mountain and Lake Maumelle, which provides Little Rock's drinking water.

The city of [[North Little Rock]] is located just across the river from Little Rock, but it is a separate city. [[North Little Rock]] was once the 8th ward of Little Rock. An [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] decision on February 6, 1904, allowed the ward to merge with the neighboring town of North Little Rock. The merged town quickly renamed itself Argenta (the local name for the former 8th Ward), but returned to its original name in October 1917.<ref name="NLR">{{cite web |last=Bradbury |first=Cary |title=North Little Rock (Pulaski County) |date=2007-11-14 |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=973 |accessdate=2008-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092200/http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=973 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>
