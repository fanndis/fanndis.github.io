'''''The Dictator''''' is a 2012 [[political satire]] [[Comedy film|comedy]] film co-written by and starring [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as his fourth feature film in a leading role. The film is directed by [[Larry Charles]], who previously directed Baron Cohen's [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]] ''[[Borat]]'' and ''[[Br√ºno]]''. Baron Cohen, in the role of Admiral General Aladeen, the [[dictator]] of the fictional Republic of Wadiya visiting the United States, stars alongside [[Anna Faris]], [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Jason Mantzoukas]], and an [[Cameo appearance|uncredited appearance]] by [[John C. Reilly]].

Producers [[Jeff Schaffer]] and [[David Mandel]] said that Baron Cohen's character was inspired by real-life [[dictator]]s like [[Kim Jong-il]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], and [[Saparmurat Niyazov]].<ref>Stuart Jeffries, [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/15/the-dictator-right-to-laugh The Dictator: are we right to laugh?], ''Guardian'' (May 15, 2012).</ref> The film's opening credits dedicate it to Kim Jong-il, "in loving memory".

==Plot==
For years, the nonfictional [[North Africa]]n nation of the Republic of Wadiya has been ruled by Admiral-General Haffaz Aladeen, a childish, [[Tyrant|tyrannical]], [[Sexism|sexist]], [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]], and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] dictator who surrounds himself with [[Amazonian Guard|female bodyguards]], sponsors terrorism (especially giving shelter to [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama Bin Laden]] after [[Osama bin Laden death conspiracy theories|"they killed his double one year ago"]]), changes many words in the Wadiyan dictionary to "Aladeen", and is working on developing [[nuclear weapon]]s to [[Anti-Zionism|attack Israel]]. He also refuses to sell Wadiya's oil fields, a promise he made to his father prior to his death. After the [[United Nations Security Council]] resolves to [[Military intervention|intervene]] militarily, Aladeen travels to the [[United Nations Headquarters|UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] to address the council.

Shortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton, supposedly in charge of the security preparations but was a hitman hired by his treacherous uncle Tamir, whom Aladeen's father passed over as successor in favor of his son. Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dimwitted [[Political decoy|lookalike]] named Efawadh, whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally [[Democratization|democratizing]] Wadiya while opening up the country's [[oil field]]s to the [[China|Chinese]] and other foreign vested interests. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally burns himself to death in a failed torture attempt. When his burnt corpse is discovered, Tamir thinks Aladeen has been killed. However, Aladeen is practically unrecognizable as Clayton shaved off his iconic beard prior to his death.

Wandering through New York City, Aladeen encounters Zoey, a [[human rights activist]] who offers him a job at her [[Progressivism|socially progressive]], [[alternative lifestyle]] co-op. Aladeen refuses the offer and encounters "Nuclear" Nadal, the former chief of Wadiya's nuclear weapons programme, whom Aladeen thought he had previously executed over an argument about the warhead's design. Aladeen follows him to New York's "Little Wadiya" district, which is populated by refugees from his own country, and meets him in "Death to Aladeen Restaurant", a restaurant run by and visited by numerous people whom Aladeen had ordered to be executed. The restaurant's waiter and the refugees mistake him as "Aladeen sympathizer" after a failed attempt to cover up his identity and is about to be attacked when Nadal saves him. Nadal reveals to Aladeen that all the people he had ordered to be executed are instead sent into exile to the United States; the secret police were actually members of the resistance. Nadal agrees to help Aladeen thwart Tamir's plot and regain his power, on condition that Aladeen makes him head of Wadiya's nuclear programme again. Aladeen agrees and accepts Zoey's job offer, as she is catering at the hotel where the signing is to occur. Aladeen grows closer to Zoey after she refuses his sexual advances and teaches him how to [[Masturbation|masturbate]], and eventually falls in love with her after seeing her angry. Turning around Zoey's struggling business, Aladeen begins imposing strict schedules on everyone, forming a [[Cult of personality|personality cult]] around Zoey and intimidating an inspector into giving the store a good review.

However, Aladeen's relationship with Zoey becomes strained after he decides to be honest with her and reveal his true self; she cannot love a man who was so brutal to his own people. After acquiring a new beard taken from a corpse, Aladeen [[Zip line|ziplines]] into the hotel and tells Efawadh he has recovered; his double was fooled into thinking the Supreme Leader was ill. At the signing ceremony, he tears up Tamir's document in front of the media and holds an impassioned speech praising the virtues of [[dictatorship]], drawing unintended parallels to current issues in the United States. However, upon seeing Zoey in the room, he declares his love for her and, knowing Zoey's strongly-held views, vows to democratize his country and open up Wadiya's oil fields for business, but in a way where the general populace will benefit. Angry with Aladeen staying in power, Tamir attempts to assassinate him but Efawadh jumps in front of the bullet and survives, as it is his job "to be shot in the head". Tamir is arrested afterwards.

A year later, Wadiya holds its first democratic elections, although they are [[Vote rigging|rigged in favor]] of Aladeen (who has now added the titles [[President (government title)|President]]&ndash;[[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] to his previous Admiral-General). Afterwards, he marries Zoey, but is shocked when she [[Glass-breaking ceremony|breaks a glass with her foot]] and reveals herself to be [[Judaism|Jewish]]; throughout the film he was shown vowing to "destroy Israel". Scenes during the [[Closing credits|credits]] show Aladeen's convoy, now consisting of [[Green vehicle|eco-friendly cars]], Aladeen visiting a re-instated Nadal, and later Zoey revealing in a television interview that she is pregnant with the couple's first child. Aladeen responds to the news by asking if Zoey is having "[[Sex-selective abortion|a boy or an abortion]]".

===Unrated version===
The unrated cut of ''The Dictator'' runs an additional fifteen minutes from the original 83-minute theatrical version. Much of the added material is additional sexual content and dialogue. There is a scene following Aladeen falling asleep in the back of the store where one of his bodyguards, Etra, tries to kill him by beating him with her enlarged breasts on orders by Tamir. Another added scene is Mr. Ogden, the manager of the Lancaster Hotel, talking to Zoey at The Collective and cancelling the catering contract because of Aladeen.

Internet rumors claimed the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] had banned Baron Cohen from attending the [[84th Academy Awards]] in his role as Admiral General Aladeen, but the Academy said the rumors were unfounded, saying, "We haven't banned him.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars out of a possible four, saying, "''The Dictator'' is funny, in addition to being obscene, disgusting, scatological, vulgar, crude and so on. Having seen Sacha Baron Cohen promoting it on countless talk shows, I feared the movie would feel like [[d√©j√† vu]]. But no. He establishes a claim to be the best comic filmmaker now working. And in a speech about dictatorships, he practices merciless political satire."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120509/REVIEWS/120519999 |title=The Dictator |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=May 9, 2012 |work= Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=May 18, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' conversely concluded, "bound to be one of the year's biggest comedy letdowns, ''The Dictator'' doesn't so much stir hot-button issues as showcase a great satirist off his game."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-dictator/6284 |title=The Dictator |date=May 12, 2012 |access-date=May 18, 2012}}</ref> Keith Uhlich of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' approved, giving it four stars out of five, and calling the opening scenes in the film "a brisk, hilarious [[jeremiad]]" and its ending monologue "a rousing, uproarious climactic speech worthy of both [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] and ''[[Team America: World Police|Team America]]''."<ref name="time out">{{cite web |url=https://www.timeout.com/us/film/the-dictator |title=The Dictator |last=Uhlich |first=Keith |date=May 17‚Äì23, 2012 |publisher=Time Out New York |access-date=June 13, 2012}}</ref>
