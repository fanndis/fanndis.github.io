==Background==
{{Main|Kurdish rebellions in Turkey|Kurds in Turkey|History of the Kurdistan Workers Party}}

Kurdish rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] go back two centuries, but the modern conflict dates back to the [[abolition of the Caliphate]]. During the reign of [[Abdul Hamid II]], who was [[Caliph]] as well as [[Sultan]], the Kurds were loyal subjects of the Caliph and the establishment of a [[secular republic]] following the abolition of the [[Caliphate]] in 1924 became a source of widespread resentment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hassan |first=Mona |title=Longing fir the Lost Caliphate: A Transregional History |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=169}}</ref> The establishment of the [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish nationalist]] state and Turkish citizenship brought an end to the centuries-old ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'' system, which had unified the Muslim ethnic groups of the Ottoman Empire under a unified Muslim identity. The diverse Muslim ethnic groups of the former Empire were considered Turkish by the newly formed [[secularism in Turkey|secular]] Turkish state, which did not recognize an independent Kurdish or Islamic national identity. One of the consequences of these seismic changes was a series of uprisings in Turkey's Kurdish-populated eastern and southeastern regions, including the brutally suppressed [[Sheikh Said rebellion]] in 1925.<ref>{{cite book |last=Şentürk |first=Burcu |title=Invisibility of a Common Sorrow: Families of the Deceased in Turkey's Kurdish Conflict |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |date=2010 |page=99 |isbn=9781443839549}}</ref> Other major historical events include the [[Bitlis uprising]] (1914), [[Kurdish rebellions during World War I]] (1914–1917), [[Koçgiri Rebellion]] (1920), [[Beytussebab rebellion]] (1924), [[Ararat rebellion]] (1930), and the [[Dersim Rebellion]] (1938).

The [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) was founded in 1974 by [[Abdullah Öcalan]]. Initially a [[Marxist–Leninist]] organization, it abandoned orthodox communism and adopted a program of greater political rights and cultural autonomy for Kurds. Between 1978 and 1980, the PKK engaged in limited [[urban warfare]] with the Turkish state to these aims. The organization restructured itself and moved the [[organization structure]] to Syria between 1980 and 1984, just after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]].

==History==
{{Main|Timeline of the Turkey–PKK conflict}}

===Beginnings===
In 1977, a small group under Öcalan's leadership released a declaration on Kurdish identity in Turkey. The group, which called itself the ''Revolutionaries of Kurdistan'' also included [[Ali Haydar Kaytan]], [[Cemil Bayik]], [[Haki Karer]] and [[Kemal Pir]].<ref name="PK 1995">{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~kicadam/kurdistan/2_99/ocalan.html |title=Abdullah Öcalan and the development of the PKK |publisher=Xs4all.nl |accessdate=15 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215175054/http://www.xs4all.nl/~kicadam/kurdistan/2_99/ocalan.html |archivedate=15 December 2010 }}</ref> The group decided in 1974<ref name="security" /> to start a campaign for Kurdish rights. Cemil Bayik was sent to [[Urfa]], Kemal Pir to [[Muş|Mus]], Haki Karer to [[Batman, Turkey|Batman]], and Ali Haydar Kaytan to [[Tunceli]]. They then started student organisations which talked to local workers and farmers about Kurdish rights.<ref name="PK 1995" />

In 1977, an assembly was held to evaluate these political activities. The assembly included 100 people from different backgrounds and several representatives of other leftist organisations. In spring 1977, Öcalan travelled to [[Mount Ararat]], [[Erzurum]], Tunceli, [[Elazig]], [[Antep]], and other cities to make the public aware of the group's activities. This was followed by a Turkish government crackdown against the organisation. On 18 March 1977, Haki Karer was assassinated in Antep. During this period, the group was also targeted by the Turkish ultranationalist organization, the [[Nationalist Movement Party]]'s [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]]. Some wealthy Kurdish landowners targeted the group as well, killing Halil Çavgun on 18 May 1978, which resulted in large protest meetings in Erzurum, [[Dersim]], Elazig, and Antep.<ref name="PK 1995" />

The founding Congress of the PKK was held on 27 November 1978 in Fis, a village near the city of [[Lice, Turkey|Lice]]. During this congress, the 25 people present decided to found the Kurdistan Workers' Party. The Turkish state, Turkish rightist groups, and some Kurdish landowners continued their attacks on the group. In response, the PKK organised and armed members to protect itself, thus becoming more involved in the [[Political violence in Turkey, 1970s|fighting between leftist and rightist groups in Turkey (1978–1980)]].<ref name="PK 1995" /> During this time, the right-wing Grey Wolves militia killed 109 and injured 176 [[Alevi]] Kurds in the town of [[Kahramanmaraş]] on 25 December 1978 in what would become known as the [[Maraş Massacre]].<ref name=david>A modern history of the Kurds, By David McDowall, page 415, at [https://books.google.com/books?id=1tarN6gfxX8C&pg=PA415&lpg=PA415&dq=Maras+Massacre&source=bl&ots=VugE6xVwFk&sig=_gQUK4y0PGbXNK5qjQNJC9lwUvc&hl=en&ei=B-4tTPyoC4OBlAf0pMnhCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=Maras%20Massacre&f=false Google Books], accessed on 1 May 2011</ref> In Summer 1979, Öcalan travelled to [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] where he made contacts with Syrian and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] leaders.<ref name="PK 1995" /> After the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|Turkish coup d'état on 12 September 1980]] and a crackdown which was launched on all political organisations,<ref name=Gil>Gil, Ata.

Some PKK fighters allegedly took part in the [[1982 Lebanon War]] on the Syrian side.<ref name="PK 1995" />

The Second PKK Party Congress was then held in [[Daraa]], Syria, from 20 to 25 August 1982. Here it was decided that the organisation would return to [[Turkish Kurdistan]] to start an armed guerilla war there for the creation of an independent Kurdish state. Meanwhile, they prepared guerrilla forces in Syria and Lebanon to go to war. However, many PKK leaders were arrested in Turkey and sent to [[Diyarbakir Prison]]. Because of the treatment of the prisoners, the prison became the site of much political protest.<ref name="PK 1995" /> (See also [[Torture in Turkey#Deaths in custody]].)

On 25 October 1986, the third Congress was held in [[Beqaa Valley]], [[Lebanon]]. Issues raised included lack of discipline, growing internal criticism, and splinter groups within the organization. This had led the organisation to execute some internal critics, especially ex-members who had joined [[Tekosin]], a rival Marxist–Leninist organization. Öcalan strongly criticized the leaders responsible for the guerrilla forces during the early 1980s and threatened others with the death penalty, if they joined rival groups or refused to obey orders. The PKK's military defeats meant they were no closer to their primary goal of an independent [[Kurdistan]]. Cooperation with criminals and [[dictator]]s had tarnished the organization's image. During the Congress, the leaders decided to advance the armed struggle, increase the number of fighters, and dissolve the [[HRK]], which was replaced by the [[Kurdistan Popular Liberation Army]] (ARGK). A newly established [[Mahsum Korkmaz Academy]], a politico-military academy, replaced the [[Helve Camp]], and a new military [[conscription]] policy was approved, which obliged every family to send someone to the guerrilla forces.<ref name="davidp1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSwrDwAAQBAJ&q=pkk+third+congress+1986&pg=PA55|title=The Kurdish Spring: A New Map of the Middle East|last=Phillips|first=David L.|date=2017-07-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351480376|language=en}}</ref><ref name="natpol1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vYtCgAAQBAJ&q=third+congress+pkk+criticism+1986&pg=PA137|title=Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey: Political Islam, Kemalism and the Kurdish Issue|last1=Casier|first1=Marlies|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|date=2010-09-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136938672|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a80KQ4jdOeUC&q=PKK+executions+fourth+congress&pg=PA144|title=Primitive Rebels Or Revolutionary Modernizers?: The Kurdish National Movement in Turkey|last=White|first=Paul J.|date=2000|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=9781856498227|language=en}}</ref>

The decisions that were taken during the third Congress transformed the PKK from a Leninist organization into one in which power was more concentrated, as Öcalan accrued more Önderlik (leadership). Some of the reasons why Öcalan took power from the other leaders, such as [[Murat Karayilan]], [[Cemil Bayik]] and [[Duran Kalkan]], were growing internal conflict and the organization's inability to stop it. According to Michael Gunter, Öcalan, even before this time , had already carried out a purge of many rival PKK members, who were tortured and forced to confess they were traitors before being executed. [[Ibrahim Halik]], [[Mehmet Ali Cetiner]], [[Mehmet Result Altinok]], [[Saime Askin]], [[Ayten Yildirim]] and [[Sabahattin Ali]] were some of the victims. Later in 2006, Öcalan denied these accusations and stated in his book that both [[Mahsum Korkmaz]], the first supreme military commander of the PKK, and [[Engin Sincer]], a high-ranking commander, likely died as a result of internal conflicts and described the perpetrators as "gangs". Leaked reports, however, revealed the [[authoritarian]] personality of Öcalan, who had brutally suppressed dissent and purged opponents since the early 1980s. According to David L. Philips, up to sixty PKK members were executed in 1986, including Mahsum Korkmaz, who he believes was murdered on 28 March 1986. Between the 1980 and 1990, the organization targeted defectors, assassinating two of them in Sweden, two in the Netherlands, three in Germany and one in Denmark.<ref name=natpol1 /><ref>{{Cite book|title=PKK'ya Dayatılan Tasfiyecilik ve Tasfiyeciligin Tasfiyesi|last=Öcalan|first=Abdullah|year=2006|isbn=|location=Turkey|pages=365}}</ref>

In 1990, during the fourth Congress, the PKK ended its unpopular conscription policy. The organization's attempts to take into the account the demands and criticism of its support base had helped it to increase its popularity. According to Stanton, the PKK's improved relationship with its civilian base likely created incentives for the government to engage in [[state terrorism]] against some of its Kurdish citizens. The PKK was rarely able to prevent this.<ref name="civtar1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIgwDQAAQBAJ&q=PKK+fourth+congress&pg=PA196|title=Violence and Restraint in Civil War: Civilian Targeting in the Shadow of International Law|last=Stanton|first=Jessica A.|date=2016-09-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316720592|language=en}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, President [[Turgut Özal]] agreed to negotiations with the PKK, after the 1991 [[Gulf War]] changed the geopolitical dynamics in the region.

In 1992, however, Turkey, backed by the [[United States]] and the [[Peshmerga]] of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] (KRG), launched [[Operation Northern Iraq]], a cross-border operation between 9 October and 1 November against the PKK, using more than 300,000 troops. Thousands of local Peshmerga, with the support of more than 20,000 Turkish troops who had crossed the Iraqi border, attacked 10,000 PKK guerrillas. Despite heavy casualties, the PKK managed to  maintain its presence in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], and a ceasefire agreement was reached between the PKK and KRG. In 1993, Özal returned to working on a peace plan with the former finance minister [[Adnan Kahveci]] and the General Commander of the Turkish Gendarmerie, [[Eşref Bitlis]].<ref>''[[Today's Zaman]]'', 11 April 2012, [http://todayszaman.com/news-277125-prosecutors-look-into-links-between-suspicious-army-deaths.html Prosecutors look into links between suspicious army deaths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109114114/http://todayszaman.com/news-277125-prosecutors-look-into-links-between-suspicious-army-deaths.html |date=9 November 2013 }}</ref>

To counter the PKK, the Turkish military started new [[counter-insurgency]] strategies between 1992 and 1995. To deprive the rebels of a logistical base of operations and punish local people supporting the PKK, the military carried out [[deforestation]] of the countryside and [[Kurdish villages depopulated by Turkey|destroyed over 3,000 Kurdish villages]], causing at least 2&nbsp;million refugees. Most of these villages were evacuated, but other villages were burned, bombed, or shelled by government forces, and several villages were obliterated from the air. While some were destroyed or evacuated, other villages agreed to join the side of the government. The state offered salaries to local farmers and shepherds to join the [[Village Guards]], to prevent the PKK from operating in these villages. Villages which refused to cooperate were evacuated by the military. These tactics managed to drive the rebels from the cities and villages into the mountains, although they still often launched reprisals on pro-government villages, which included attacks on civilians.<ref>[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.indian/2005-08/msg00317.html Turkey's war on the Kurds] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714012631/http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.indian/2005-08/msg00317.html |date=14 July 2012 }}, 13 August 2005</ref> During [[Newroz as celebrated by Kurds|Newroz]] (the Kurdish New Year) in March 1995, the Turkish military launched its largest military operation against the PKK in Iraq.

Finally on 21 March 2013, after months of negotiations with the Turkish Government, Abdullah Ocalan's letter to people was read both in Turkish and Kurdish during [[Nowruz]] celebrations in [[Diyarbakır]]. The letter called a cease-fire that included disarmament and withdrawal from Turkish soil and calling ''an end to armed struggle''. [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] announced that they would obey, stating that the year of 2013 is the year of solution either through war or through peace.

<nowiki>*:</nowiki>these names by Turkey military or political leadership have communication / propaganda purposes
<br><nowiki>**:</nowiki>  Most of Turkey's Operation Euphrates Shield combats were between TSK & TFSA against IS on one side, and between YPG against IS on the other, while the Turkish forces and US-allied YPG avoided full scale clashed. Turkey strategic objective was to prevent [[Afrin canton]] from connecting with [[Shahba Canton|YPG Manbij]] and other [[Regions of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria|Rojava regions]]. Accordingly, only a minor part of these operations casualties were from Turkey forces vs YPG forces..

==Demographic effect==

The [[Turkification]] of predominantly Kurdish areas in country's East and South-East were also bound in the early ideas and policies of modern Turkish nationalism, going back to as early as 1918 to the manifesto of Turkish nationalist [[Ziya Gökalp]] "Turkification, Islamization and Modernization".<ref name=joost /> The evolving [[Young Turks|Young Turk]] conscience adopted a specific interpretation of progressism, a trend of thought which emphasizes the human ability to make, improve and reshape human society, relying of science, technology and experimentation.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last=Üngör|first=Ugur Ümit|title=The Making of Modern Turkey: Nation and State in Eastern Anatolia, 1913-1950|date=2012-03-01|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-164076-6|location=|pages=153–154|language=en}}</ref> This notion of social evolution was used to support and justify policies of population control.<ref name=":7" /> The [[Kurdish rebellions in Turkey|Kurdish rebellions]] provided a comfortable pretext for Turkish [[Kemalism|Kemalists]] to implement such ideas, and in a [[1934 Turkish Resettlement Law|Settlement Law was issued in 1934]].

====Massacres====

In August 1993, Turkish security forces opened fire during the protest, killing 10 people and wounding 51.<ref> https://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38e91e.html</ref>

In November 1992, the Turkish gendarmerie officers forced the leader of the Kelekçi village to evacuate all of the inhabitants, before shooting at them and their houses with heavy weapons. The soldiers set up fire to nine houses and forced all villagers to flee. Later soldiers burned the rest of the village and destroyed all 136 houses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/eca/turkey1206/3.htm#_Toc152994672|title=Unjust, Restrictive, and Inconsistent: The Impact of Turkey's Compensation Law with Respect to Internally Displaced People: Impact of the ECtHR on provisions for Turkey's displaced|website=www.hrw.org|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>

In 1993, Mehmet Ogut, his pregnant wife and all their seven children were burned to death by [[Special Forces (Turkish Armed Forces)|Turkish special forces]] soldiers. The Turkish authorities initially blamed the PKK and refused to investigate the case until it was opened again 17 years later. The investigations eventually came to an end in late 2014 with sentences of life imprisonment for three gendarme officers, a member of the special forces and nine soldiers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkish military guilty of killing family of 9, blamed on PKK for 20 years|url=http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/09012016|accessdate=9 January 2016|work=Rudaw|agency=Rudaw}}</ref>

On 8 September 1993, the [[Turkish Air Force]] dropped a bomb near the Munzur mountains, killing 2 women.

According to Amnesty International, the curfews had been imposed in more than 19 different towns and districts, putting the lives of hundreds of thousands of people at risk.

[[Human Rights Watch]] notes in 1992 that:
* As Human Rights Watch has often reported and condemned, Turkish government forces have, during the conflict with the PKK, also committed serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including [[torture]], extrajudicial killings, and indiscriminate fire. We continue to demand that the Turkish government investigate and hold accountable those members of its security forces responsible for these violations. Nonetheless, under international law, the government abuses cannot under any circumstances be seen to justify or excuse those committed by Ocalan's PKK.<ref name=hrwdalema />
* The Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), a separatist group that espouses the use of violence for political ends, continues to wage guerrilla warfare in the southeast, frequently in violation of international humanitarian law, or the laws of war. Instead of attempting to capture, question and indict people suspected of illegal activity, Turkish security forces killed suspects in house raids, thus acting as investigator, judge, jury and executioner. Police routinely asserted that such deaths occurred in shoot-outs between police and "terrorists". In many cases, eyewitnesses reported that no firing came from the attacked house or apartment. Reliable reports indicated that while the occupants of raided premises were shot and killed, no police were killed or wounded during the raids. This discrepancy suggests that the killings were summary, extrajudicial executions, in violation of international human rights and humanitarian law.<ref name="hrwdevelopments"/>

Turkish–Kurdish human right activists in Germany accused Turkey of using chemical weapons against PKK. Hans Baumann, a German expert on photo forgeries, investigated the authenticity of the photos and claimed that the photos were authentic. A forensics report released by the Hamburg University Hospital has backed the allegations. Claudia Roth from Germany's Green Party demanded an explanation from the Turkish government.<ref name="spiegel">{{cite news|last=Steinvorth|first=Daniel|title=Shocking Images of Dead Kurdish Fighters: Turkey Accused of Using Chemical Weapons against PKK|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/shocking-images-of-dead-kurdish-fighters-turkey-accused-of-using-chemical-weapons-against-pkk-a-711536.html|accessdate=23 July 2013|newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]]|date=12 August 2010|author2=Musharbash, Yassin}}</ref> The Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Selçuk Ünal commented on the issue.

In response to the activities of the PKK, the Turkish government placed Southeastern Anatolia, where citizens of Kurdish descent are in the majority, under military rule. The Turkish Army and the Kurdish village guards loyal to it have abused Kurdish civilians, resulting in [[mass migration]]s to cities.<ref name="mcdowall" /> The Government claimed that the displacement policy aimed to remove the shelter and support of the local population and consequently, the population of cities such as Diyarbakır and [[Cizre]] more than doubled.<ref name=phillips>{{cite book|last1=David L.|first1=Phillips|title=From Bullets to Ballots: Violent Muslim Movements in Transition|date=2011|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412812016|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNq0gvBPcGQC&pg=PA121}}</ref> However, martial law and military rule was lifted in the last provinces in 2002.

====State terrorism====

Since its foundation, the [[Republic of turkey|Republic of Turkey]] has pursued variously [[assimilationist]] and [[Political repression|repressive]] policies towards the [[Kurdish people]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/11/01/protesting-terrorist-offense/arbitrary-use-terrorism-laws-prosecute-and|title=Protesting as a Terrorist Offense: The Arbitrary Use of Terrorism Laws to Prosecute and Incarcerate Demonstrators in Turkey|date=2010-11-01|website=Human Rights Watch|language=en|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref> At the beginning of the conflict, the PKK's relationship with its civilian supporters created incentives for the Turkish government to use [[state terrorism|terrorism]] against the Kurdish citizens in the Kurdish dominated southeast region of Turkey.<ref name=civtar1 /> Since the early 1980s, the authorities have systematically used arbitrary arrests, executions of suspects, excessive force, and torture to suppress the opponents. In 1993, the report published by [[Human Rights Watch]] stated:<ref name=hrwrep1993 />
{{quote|Kurds in Turkey have been killed, tortured and disappeared at an appalling rate since the coalition government of Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel took office in November 1991. In addition, many of their cities have been brutally attacked by security forces, hundreds of their villages have been forcibly evacuated, their ethnic identity continues to be attacked, their rights to free expression denied and their political freedom placed in jeopardy.|sign=|source=}}

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the authorities even executed the Kurdish civilians and took the pictures of their corpses with the weapons, they carried for staging the events, in order to show them as [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) "terrorists" to press. In 1995, another report published by [[Human Rights Watch]] stated:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/Turkey.htm|title=Turkey|website=www.hrw.org|access-date=2019-01-07}}</ref>
{{quote|Based on B.G.'s statement and substantial additional evidence, Human Rights Watch believes that the official government casualty estimates severely misrepresent the true number of civilians slain by government forces. It is likely that many of the persons referred to in the official estimates as "PKK casualties" were in fact civilians shot by mistake or deliberately killed by security forces. Witness testimony also demonstrates that many of the Turkish government's denials of wrong-doing by the Turkish security forces are fabrications manufactured by soldiers or officials somewhere along the government's chain of command.}}

Shooting and killing peaceful demonstrators was one of the methods the security forces used to spread fear. In 1992, the security forces killed more than 103 demonstrators, 93 of them during the celebration of Newroz in three Kurdish cities. No security force member was ever charged with any of the deaths.<ref name=hrwrep1993 />

In the early 1990s, hundreds of people had disappeared after they had been taken into custody by security forces. Only in 1992, more than 450 people had been reportedly killed. Among those killed were journalists, teachers, doctors, human rights activists and political leaders. The security forces usually denied to have detained the victims but sometimes they claimed that they had released the victims after "holding them briefly".<ref name="hrwrep1993">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1993|title=THE KURDS OF TURKEY: KILLINGS, DISAPPEARANCES AND TORTURE|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/TURKEY933.PDF|journal=HRW: The Kurds of Turkey: Killings, Disappearances and Torture|volume=|pages=2|via=}}</ref> According to the [[Human Rights Association (Turkey)|Human Rights Association (İHD)]], there have been 940 cases of enforced disappearance since the 1990s.

During the 1990s and onward Turkish security services have detained Kurds, in some cases they were never seen again with only eyewitnesses coming forward to tell the story.<ref name="hrw-disappearances">{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/11/05/turkey-no-answers-kurdish-victims|publisher=Human Rights Watch|title=Turkey: No Answers for Kurdish Victims}}</ref> In 1997, Amnesty International (AI) reported that disappearances and extrajudicial executions had emerged as new and disturbing patterns of human rights violations by the Turkish state.<ref name="AmnestyChapter2">[https://www.amnesty.org/ailib/intcam/turkey/turk2.htm Turkey campaign (Chapter 2)], [[Amnesty International]], 1997. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714171715/http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/intcam/turkey/turk2.htm |date=14 July 2007 }}</ref><ref name="HRW-disappearances2">{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/09/03/time-justice/ending-impunity-killings-and-disappearances-1990s-turkey|publisher=Human Rights Watch (HRW)|title=Time for Justice Ending Impunity for Killings and Disappearances in 1990s Turkey}}</ref>

====Torture====

In August 1992, [[Human Rights Watch]] reported the vile practice of torture by security forces in Turkey. The victims of torture interviewed by Helsinki Watch had revealed the systematic practice of torture against detainees in police custody. Sixteen people had died in suspicious circumstances in police custody, ten of them Kurds in the Southeast.<ref name=hrwrep1993 />

In 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the rape and torture of Kurdish prisoners in Turkey are disturbingly commonplace. According to the report, published by Amnesty International in 2003, Hamdiye Aslan, a prisoner accused of supporting the Kurdish group, the PKK, had been detained in Mardin Prison, south-east Turkey, for almost three months in which she was reportedly blindfolded, anally raped with a truncheon, threatened and mocked by officers.<ref name =gg>{{cite web|author=Meral Duzgun |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/10/turkey-history-sexual-violence |title=Turkey: a history of sexual violence |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref>

In February 2017, a report published by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] stated the Turkish authorities had beaten and punched detainees, using sexual violence, including rape and threat of rape. In some cases, the detainees were photographed nude and threatened with [[public humiliation]] after being tortured by [[Turkish army|Turkish authorities]].<ref name=un122017 />

====Executions====

On 24 February 1992, Cengiz Altun, the Batman correspondent for the weekly pro-Kurdish newspaper, ''[[Yeni Ülke]],'' was killed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Political Violence and Kurds in Turkey|last=Orhun|first=Mehmet|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138918870|location=|pages=184}}</ref> More than 33 Kurdish journalists working for different newspapers were killed between 1990 and 1995. The killings of Kurdish journalists had started after the pro-Kurdish press had started to publish the first daily newspaper by the name of "[[Özgür Gündem]]" (Free Agenda). [[Musa Anter]], a prominent Kurdish intellectual and journalist of Özgur Gundem, was assassinated by members of [[Gendarmerie Intelligence Organization]] in 1992.

In 1992, Turkish security forces executed seventy-four people in house raids and more than hundred people in demonstrations.<ref name=hrwrep1993 />

====Kidnappings====

In its early stages, some PKK members and groups systematically recruited children, men and women by kidnapping them. This forced families whose children were already a member of the organization to cooperate and thus turning them into accomplices, which increased the number of women joining the group, according to the publication, published by the Jamestown Foundation. The systematic kidnapping of man, women and even children was at its peak between the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the PKK decided to force every family to send someone to serve their armed wings after the third Congress. Many members who had been kidnapped were described as heroes in Serxwebun, the PKK's monthly magazine, after they were killed in the clashes. Some victims like Esengul Akgul, a child soldier who had been allegedly kidnapped when she was only ten years old in 1990, were described as model 'revolutionary fighters' when they died.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Serxwebun 1997|last=|first=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=392}}</ref><ref name="gender">Ali Özcan, Nihat{{cite web|url=http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373638|title=PKK Recruitment of Female Operatives|accessdate=2010-08-23|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915044101/http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373638|archivedate=15 September 2007|df=dmy}}, ''Global Terrorism Analysis'', [[Jamestown Foundation]], Volume 4, Issue 28, 11 September 2007.</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4XefrTlSygC&q=pkk+recruit+women&pg=PA40|title=Understanding International Counter Terrorism: A Professional's Guide to the Operational Art|first=A.|last=Hunsicker|date=5 January 2019|publisher=Universal-Publishers|accessdate=5 January 2019|via=Google Books|isbn=9781581129052}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTN0481FXRYC&q=pkk+recruit+women&pg=PA67|title=Women as Terrorists: Mothers, Recruiters, and Martyrs|first1=Kim|last1=Cragin|first2=Sara A.|last2=Daly|date=5 January 2019|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=5 January 2019|via=Google Books|isbn=9780275989095}}</ref>

====Terrorism====

In the early 1980s, [[Abdullah Öcalan]], the organization's leader, demanded the civilians to choose between loyalty to the government and support for the PKK, which reportedly led to the campaign of propaganda and [[terrorism|terror]] against some civilians, doctors, nurses, Kurdish elites, government institutions, schools and even hospitals. Thousands of people were reportedly killed for serving the government or just for refusing to support the organization. Additionally, hundreds of schools were burned and only between 1984 and 1987, more than 217 teachers were murdered. The PKK saw schools as "emblems of Turkish imperialism" that belonged to the "colonial assimilation system" and a justification for the killing of teachers was that they taught Turkish to Kurdish children.<ref name=davidp1 />

In the early 1990s, the organization allegedly began to bomb civilian targets and commit massacres against innocent civilians after the government refused to negotiate. According to Jessica Stanton, an associate professor in the global policy area, the shift in PKK tactics was a direct response to government behavior. [[Abdullah Öcalan]], the organization's leader, has been claimed to have stated publicly: {{quote|If attacks on military and police targets could not force the government to negotiate, then perhaps attacks on civilian targets would.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIgwDQAAQBAJ&q=pkk+targeted+tourism+finish+tourists+book&pg=PA221|title=Violence and Restraint in Civil War: Civilian Targeting in the Shadow of International Law|first=Jessica A.|last=Stanton|date=26 September 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=5 January 2019|via=Google Books|isbn=9781316720592}}</ref>}}

Some organization's campaigns were so brutal and violent that it even caused criticism within the organization. During the organization's fourth Conference, some leaders and members of the organization demanded the end of attacks against the civilians who cooperate with the government. This reduced the number of attacks significantly for a few years but didn't end them. Some organization groups continued to slaughter civilians, bomb tourist sites and hotels, and kidnap tourists, and is claimed to be responsible for roughly 7,000 civilian deaths since it was founded.

On 21 October 1993, the organization committed the Derince Massacre, killing 22 people from the same family. Women, children and babies were executed after being accused of cooperating with the state. The PKK has been also claimed to have executed some bakers that had delivered bread to army bases, burnt down and killed some owners of fuel stations that served the authorities in the areas they were active in. In some cases, the organization’s members had reportedly forbidden the distribution of Turkish newspapers and the watching of Turkish television channels, forcing the inhabitants to remove their antennae. The inhabitants in some areas were banned from joining any Turkish political party and were forced to get the approval of the PKK if they were to run for local offices.<ref name=":14">{{cite book|last1=Nachmani|first1=Amikam|title=Turkey: facing a new millennium: Coping with intertwined conflicts|date=2009|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9781847795595|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbxrBgAAQBAJ}}</ref> According to [[Amnesty International]] reports in 1997, the PKK has tortured and killed Kurdish peasants and its own members that were against them in the 1980s.

====Executions====
[[Abdullah Öcalan]], the leader of the organization, who captured power by brutally suppressing dissent and purging opponents after the PKK's third Congress, consolidated absolute power through a campaign of torture and executions he started against the closest cadres in 1980.  Only in 1986, the PKK executed more than sixty of its members, including [[Mahsum Korkmaz]], who is believed to have been murdered during the clashes on 28 March 1986.<ref name="davidp1" /> The organization also targeted the defectors and assassinated at least eight of them in the [[European Union|EU]].
