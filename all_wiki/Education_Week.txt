{{Education in the U.S.}}
'''''Education Week''''' is an independent news organization that has covered [[K–12 (education)|K–12 education]] since 1981. It is known for providing both news and analysis, along with explanatory and investigative journalism across a range of digital, print, and broadcast platforms as well as through live and virtual events. It is owned by Editorial Projects in Education (EPE), a [[nonprofit organization]], whose mission is to raise awareness and understanding of critical issues facing American schools. It is headquartered in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] in [[Greater Washington DC]].

The newspaper publishes 37 issues a year, including three special annual reports (''Quality Counts'', ''Technology Counts'', and ''Leaders to Learn From''). Other in-depth coverage includes regular, deep-dive topical reports on subjects like personalized learning, teacher recruitment, and assessment.

== History ==
In 1957, Corbin Gwaltney, founder and then editor of ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'' for alumni of [[Johns Hopkins University]], and a group of other university alumni magazine editors came together to discuss writing on higher education and decided to form Editorial Projects for Education (EPE), a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] educational organization. Soon after, Gwaltney left Johns Hopkins Magazine to become the first full-time employee of the newly created EPE, starting in an office in his apartment in [[Baltimore]] and later moving to an office near the Johns Hopkins campus.<ref name="BALDWINPL1995">{{cite book | last =Baldwin| first =Patricia L.| title =Covering the Campus: The History of the Chronicle of Higher Education, 1966-1993| publisher =University of North Texas Press| date =1995| location =Denton, Texas| pages =167| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=aNwjHVzwyjwC&printsec=frontcover| isbn =0-929398-96-3}}</ref> He realized that higher education would benefit from a news publication.<ref name="DEPASQUALE042000" /> Gwaltney and other board members of EPE met to plan a new publication. In 1966, EPE published the first issue of ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''.<ref name="DEPASQUALE042000">{{cite journal| last=De Pasquale| first=Sue| title=A Model of Lively Thought| journal=Johns Hopkins Magazine| publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]| date=April 2000| url=http://www.jhu.edu/~jhumag/0400web/corbin.html| accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>Viadero, Debra, [http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2006/09/06/02edweek-s2.h26.html Education Week: "A Media Organization With Many Faces"].

In 1978, EPE sold ''Chronicle'' to its editors and shifted its attention. With the support of several philanthropies, and using the successful model of ''Chronicle'', EPE went on to launch ''Education Week'' under the leadership of Ronald A. Wolk.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ronald-wolk-whose-education-week-put-national-spotlight-on-schools-dies-at-86/2018/05/02/7f2f5538-4e04-11e8-b725-92c89fe3ca4c_story.html|title=Ronald Wolk, whose Education Week put national spotlight on schools, dies at 86|last=Anderson|first=Nick|date=2018-05-02|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> The first issue of ''Education Week'' appeared on Sept. 7, 1981, and sought to provide ''Chronicle''-like coverage of elementary and secondary education.<ref>{{cite journal
