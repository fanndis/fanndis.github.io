== Career ==

=== 1976–1989 ===
Leigh worked in her first film at age nine, a nonspeaking role for the film ''Death of a Stranger (The Execution)'' (1973). At age 14, Leigh attended acting workshops, taught by [[Lee Strasberg]], and the [[Stagedoor Manor]] Performing Arts Training Center in [[Loch Sheldrake, New York]]. Afterwards, she landed a role in the film ''The Young Runaways'' (1978). She also appeared in an episode of ''[[Baretta]]'' and an episode of ''[[The Waltons]]''. Several television films followed, including a portrayal of an [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexic]] teenager in ''[[The Best Little Girl in the World]]'', for which Leigh dropped to {{convert|86|lb|kg}} under medical supervision. She made her big-screen debut playing a blind, deaf, and mute rape victim in the 1981 [[slasher film]] ''[[Eyes of a Stranger (1981 film)|Eyes of a Stranger]]''; she quit school to star in the film.<ref name="guardian interview"/>

In 1982, Leigh played a teenager who gets pregnant in the [[Cameron Crowe]]-scripted high-school comedy film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', which served as a launching pad for several of its young stars. While decrying the writing as sexist and exploitative, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] was enthusiastic about the acting, singling out Leigh and writing, "Don't they know they have a star on their hands?"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-1982|title=Fast Times at Ridgemont High|last=Ebert|first=Roger|work=RogerEbert.com|date=January 1, 1982|access-date=November 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022556/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-1982|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> With the exception of ''Ridgemont High'' and a supporting role in the 1983 comedy film ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'' alongside [[Rodney Dangerfield]], Leigh's early film work consisted of playing fragile, damaged, or [[Neurosis|neurotic]] characters in low-budget horror or thriller genre films. She played a virginal princess kidnapped and raped by mercenaries in ''[[Flesh and Blood (1985 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), an innocent waitress pursued by the psychopathic title character in ''[[The Hitcher (1986 film)|The Hitcher]]'' (1986) (both films pitting her alongside [[Rutger Hauer]]), and a young woman on the verge of a [[nervous breakdown]] in ''[[Heart of Midnight (film)|Heart of Midnight]]'' (1989).

=== 1990–1999 ===
In 1990, Leigh made a significant career breakthrough when she was awarded [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyfcc.com/awards/?awardyear=1990|title=New York Film Critics Circle Awards: 1990|work=New York Film Critics Circle|access-date=March 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517073741/http://www.nyfcc.com/awards/?awardyear=1990|archive-date=May 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and the [[Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bostonfilmcritics.org/past-winners-1990s/|title=BSFC Winners 1990s|work=Boston Society of Film Critics|access-date=February 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717194814/https://bostonfilmcritics.org/past-winners-1990s/|archive-date=July 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> for her portrayals of two very different prostitutes: the tough streetwalker Tralala who is brutally gang-raped in ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn (film)|Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'', and Susie, a teenage prostitute who falls in love with ex-con [[Alec Baldwin]] in ''[[Miami Blues]]''.

Leigh was then cast in her first mainstream Hollywood studio film, the firefighter drama ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'' (1991), in which she played a more conventional role, the girlfriend of lead actor [[William Baldwin]]. Leigh found more success in the gritty crime drama ''[[Rush (1991 film)|Rush]]'' (1991), portraying an undercover cop who becomes a junkie and falls in love with her partner, played by [[Jason Patric]]. Her next film, ''Single White Female'' (1992), was a surprise box-office success, bringing Leigh to her largest mainstream audience yet, portraying a mentally ill woman who terrorizes roommate [[Bridget Fonda]].

Leigh was awarded the [[MTV Movie Award for Best Villain]] at the [[1993 MTV Movie Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/1993/|title=1993 MTV Movie Awards|work=[[MTV]]|access-date=March 25, 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69tTNTjtq?url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/1993/|archive-date=August 13, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> and nominated for [[Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress]]. Leigh co-starred with [[Kathy Bates]] as a tormented, pill-popping woman hiding a history of childhood sexual abuse in the adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Dolores Claiborne (film)|Dolores Claiborne]]'' (1995). Leigh achieved her greatest acclaim in the role of Sadie Flood, an angry, drug-addicted rock singer living in the shadow of her successful older sister ([[Mare Winningham]]), in ''Georgia'' (1995). For the role, Leigh dropped to {{convert|90|lb|kg}} and sang all of her songs live, including a rambling 8{{sfrac|1|2}}-minute version of [[Van Morrison]]'s "Take Me Back". ''Georgia'' was met with critical praise. [[James Berardinelli]] wrote, "There are times when it's uncomfortable to watch this performance because it's so powerful",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/georgia.html|title=Georgia|last=Berardinelli|first=James|work=Reelviews.net|access-date=March 22, 2013}}</ref> and [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Leigh's "fierce, risk-taking performance and flashes of overwhelming honesty".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE5D6113AF933A0575AC0A963958260|title=Movie Review – Georgia|last=Maslin|first=Janet|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 30, 1995|access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref>

=== Writing and directing ===
In 2001, Leigh co-wrote and co-directed ''[[The Anniversary Party]]'', an independently produced feature film about a recently reconciled married couple who assemble their friends at their Hollywood Hills house, ostensibly to celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary. As the evening progresses, the party disintegrates into emotional confrontations and bitter arguments as the façade of their happy marriage crumbles. Leigh was inspired by her recent experience filming the low-budget [[Dogme 95]] film ''[[The King Is Alive]]''.<ref name="Salon interview">{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2001/06/26/leigh_4/|title=Jennifer Jason Leigh|last=Lemons|first=Stephen|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=June 26, 2001|access-date=November 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128001354/https://www.salon.com/2001/06/26/leigh_4/|archive-date=November 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Leigh and co-writer [[Alan Cumming]] drew freely from their personal experiences in the writing of the film.<ref name="Salon interview"/> Leigh plays an aging actress who makes jokes about her lack of Academy Award nominations and is fearful of losing her bisexual husband (Cumming).

== Other work ==
Leigh filmed a role in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s final film ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999) as a grieving patient of Dr. Bill Harford ([[Tom Cruise]]) who declares her love for him after her father's death. Kubrick wanted to reshoot the scenes, but Leigh was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Existenz|eXistenZ]]''; instead, her scenes were cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-04-27-9904270063-story.html|title=Hyper 'Existenz'|first=Gary|last=Dretzka|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 27, 1999|access-date=May 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512042834/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-04-27-9904270063-story.html|archive-date=May 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Leigh was originally cast as [[Vincent Gallo]]'s girlfriend in his self-directed film ''[[The Brown Bunny]]'', and was apparently prepared to perform [[oral sex]] on Gallo as the script required. Leigh subsequently commented that "it just didn't work out" and the role was eventually played by [[Chloë Sevigny]].<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/leigh%20would%20not%20have%20shied%20away%20from%20brown%20bunny%20controversy_1050658 Jennifer Jason Leigh – Leigh Would Not Have Shied Away From Brown Bunny Controversy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004035809/http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/leigh%20would%20not%20have%20shied%20away%20from%20brown%20bunny%20controversy_1050658 |date=October 4, 2008 }} Music, Film and Entertainment News, 2007/11/19</ref> In 1997, she was featured in [[Faith No More]]'s music video for "[[Last Cup of Sorrow]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.fnm.com/faq/#48|title=Faith No More Frequently Asked Questions|last=Samborska|first=Agatha|work=Faith No More Official Website|access-date=March 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612084431/http://old.fnm.com/faq/#48|archive-date=June 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> She was selected as one of "America's 10 Most Beautiful Women" by ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' magazine in 1989 and served as a jury member at the [[57th Venice International Film Festival]] in 2000.

== Personal life ==
In 1982, Leigh's father, Vic Morrow, was accidentally killed along with two child actors when [[Twilight Zone accident|a helicopter stunt went wrong]] during the filming of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''. Leigh and her sister filed a wrongful death lawsuit against [[Warner Bros.]], [[John Landis]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]. They [[Settlement (litigation)|settled out of court]] a year later and the terms of the settlement have never been made public.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/40963425/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/|title=Vic Morrow's daughters settle suit over death|work=[[The San Bernardino Sun]]|agency=Associated Press|date=December 31, 1983|access-date=December 23, 2019|page=A-2|via=Newspapers.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223040859/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/40963425/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/|archive-date=December 23, 2019|url-status=live}} {{free access}}</ref>

She met independent film writer-director [[Noah Baumbach]] in 2001 while starring on Broadway in ''Proof''. The couple married on September 2, 2005. Their son was born on March 17, 2010. Leigh filed for divorce on November 15, 2010, in [[Los Angeles]], citing irreconcilable differences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/11/exclusive-single-white-female-star-jennifer-jason-leigh-files-divorce/|title=''Single White Female Star'' Jennifer Jason Leigh Files For Divorce|work=[[RadarOnline]]|date=November 23, 2010|access-date=December 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223163903/https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/11/exclusive-single-white-female-star-jennifer-jason-leigh-files-divorce/|archive-date=December 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She sought spousal support as well as primary custody of the couple's son, with visitation for Baumbach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/celebrity/jennifer-jason-leigh-files-for-divorce/|title=Jennifer Jason Leigh Files for Divorce|last=Lee|first=Ken|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=November 23, 2010|access-date=December 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203010845/https://people.com/celebrity/jennifer-jason-leigh-files-for-divorce/|archive-date=December 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The divorce was finalized in September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/467698/jennifer-jason-leigh-officially-divorced-from-director-noah-baumbach|title=Jennifer Jason Leigh Officially Divorced From Director Noah Baumbach|last=Finn|first=Natalie|work=[[E!]]|date=October 7, 2013|access-date=December 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181202202720/https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/467698/jennifer-jason-leigh-officially-divorced-from-director-noah-baumbach|archive-date=December 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
