Beijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the [[List of IOC meetings|112th]] [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, [[Istanbul]], and [[Osaka]]. Prior to the session, five other cities ([[Bangkok]], [[Cairo]], [[Havana]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], and [[Seville]]) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a [[majority]] of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.<ref name="Election">{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/beijing/election_uk.asp |title=Beijing 2008: Election |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] |accessdate=18 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205234608/http://olympic.org/uk/games/beijing/election_uk.asp |archive-date=5 December 2006 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Toronto's bid was its 5th failure since 1960 (failed bids for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 games, losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/07/24/toronto-has-made-5-attempts-to-host-the-olympics-could-the-sixth-be-the-winner.html|title=Toronto has made 5 attempts to host the Olympics.

Members of the IOC did not disclose their votes, but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations who had received assistance from China in the construction of stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] to Sydney were all factors in the decision.<ref name="beijingchosen">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/sports/olympics-beijing-wins-bid-for-2008-olympic-games.html | title=OLYMPICS; Beijing Wins Bid for 2008 Olympic Games | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=14 July 2001 | accessdate=11 June 2009 | last=Longman | first=Jere | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019020637/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/sports/olympics-beijing-wins-bid-for-2008-olympic-games.html | archive-date=19 October 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref> Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of [[2000 Summer Olympics bids|voting]] for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/sports/olympics-2000-olympics-go-to-sydney-in-surprise-setback-for-china.html | title=Olympics; 2000 Olympics Go to Sydney In Surprise Setback for China | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=24 September 1993 | accessdate=5 June 2009 | author=Riding, Alan | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130021127/http://nytimes.com/1993/09/24/sports/olympics-2000-olympics-go-to-sydney-in-surprise-setback-for-china.html | archive-date=30 November 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Human rights concerns expressed by [[Amnesty International]] and politicians in both Europe and the United States were considered by the delegates, according to IOC Executive Director François Carrard. Carrard and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human rights in China. In addition, a number of IOC delegates who had formerly been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games, considering the high levels of air pollution in Beijing. China outlined plans to address these environmental concerns in its bid application.<ref name=beijingchosen/>

=== Costs ===
The ''Oxford Olympics Study 2016'' estimates the outturn cost of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at US$6.8 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 2% in real terms.<ref>{{Cite book|ssrn=2804554|title=The Oxford Olympics Study 2016: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|last2=Stewart|first2=Allison|last3=Budzier|first3=Alexander|publisher=Saïd Business School Working Papers (Oxford: University of Oxford)|year=2016|location=Oxford|pages=18–20}}</ref> This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) ''operational costs'' incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) ''direct capital costs'' incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are ''not'' included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Beijing Olympics' cost of US$6.8 billion compares with costs of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and US$15 billion for London 2012. Average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.

On 6 March 2009, the [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games]] reported that total spending on the games was "generally as much as that of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games", which was equivalent to about US$15&nbsp;billion. They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Surplus of Beijing Olympic Games exceeds 16 million USD|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90884/6608035.html|publisher=[[People's Daily Online]]|date=6 March 2009|accessdate=5 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624100914/http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90884/6608035.html|archive-date=24 June 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40&nbsp;billion to $44&nbsp;billion, which would make the Games "far and away the most expensive ever".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSPEK25823820080805 | title=Beijing Games to be costliest, but no debt legacy | work=[[Reuters]] | date=5 August 2008 | accessdate=5 June 2009 | author=Rabinovitch, Simon | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714014915/http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSPEK25823820080805 | archive-date=14 July 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.pravda.ru/sports/games/06-08-2008/106003-beijing_olympics-0/|title=Beijing Olympics to cost China 44 billion dollars|work=Pravda|date=8 August 2008|accessdate=29 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802050026/http://english.pravda.ru/sports/games/06-08-2008/106003-beijing_olympics-0/|archive-date=2 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/28/olympicgames2008.china1|title=The cost of the Beijing Olympics|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=28 July 2008|accessdate=5 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902123910/http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/28/olympicgames2008.china1|archive-date=2 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

The showpiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing National Stadium, nicknamed "The Bird's Nest" because of its nest-like skeletal structure.  The stadium hosted both the [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing]] ceremonies, as well as the [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics|athletics]] competition.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/supporters-protesters-greet-olympic-torch-s-arrival-in-beijing-1.701340 | title=Supporters, protesters greet Olympic torch's arrival in Beijing | work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]] | date=6 August 2009 | accessdate=20 June 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231233748/https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/supporters-protesters-greet-olympic-torch-s-arrival-in-beijing-1.701340 | archive-date=31 December 2008 | url-status=live }}</ref> Construction of the venue began on 24 December 2003.

The 2008 Beijing Olympics caused traditional [[Hutong]] neighborhoods to be cleared for the construction of modern Olympic stadiums. In an effort to ensure success for the games, the government invested billions in building new infrastructure, although clearance to tiny, outdated neighborhoods in Beijing called hutongs resulted (Petrun). Jim Yardley, a New York Times reporter interviews Pan Jinyu, a 64-year-old local resident: "They [the government] don't want foreigners to see this scarred old face". Feng Shuqin and her husband, Zheng Zhanlin have lived in their house for 50 years and the family has owned the property before the Communists took control in 1949. The government, trying to clear the area, has offered them to move with a compensatory sum of US$175,000, but the family insists the land is worth US$1.4 million (Yardley). Michael Meyer, an American who lives in the hutongs reported that a total of 500,000 residents were relocated from their homes before the Olympics began (Meyer).

The 2008 Summer Olympics emblem was known as [[Dancing Beijing]]. The emblem combined a traditional Chinese red seal and a representation of the [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphic]] [[Chinese character|character]] for "capital" ([[wikt:京|京]] , also the second character of Beijing's Chinese name) with athletic features. The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolized the invitation from China to the world to share in its culture.

The relay began 24 March 2008, in [[Olympia, Greece]]. From there, it traveled across Greece to [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on 31 March. From Beijing, the torch followed a route passing through every continent except Antarctica. The torch visited cities on the [[Silk Road]], symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. A total of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations and entities.<ref name="BOCOG relay">{{cite news |url=http://torchrelay.beijing2008.cn/en/news/headlines/n214042288.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308103032/http://torchrelay.beijing2008.cn/en/news/headlines/n214042288.shtml |archive-date=8 March 2008 | title=Beijing 2008 Olympic Torch Relay Planned Route and Torch Design unveiled | work=[[BOCOG]] | date=26 April 2007 | accessdate=26 April 2007}}</ref>

The originally proposed route would have taken the torch through [[Taipei]] after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the [[Taiwan independence|independence]]-leaning [[Democratic Progressive Party]]) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make the portion of the relay in Taiwan appear to be part of the torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route.<ref name="Taiwan relay">{{cite news |url=http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=24170&CtNode=122 | title=Taiwan rejects 'domestic' Olympic torch route | work=[[Taiwan Journal]] | date=4 May 2007 | accessdate=15 August 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411165900/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=24170&CtNode=122 | archive-date=11 April 2008}}</ref> This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the [[flag of the Republic of China|flag]] and the [[National Anthem of the Republic of China|national anthem of the Republic of China]] be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7005984.stm | title=Olympic torch will bypass Taiwan | work=[[BBC News]] | date=21 September 2007 | accessdate=20 June 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930022455/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7005984.stm | archive-date=30 September 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Sports ===
The program for the Beijing Games was quite similar to that of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games.  Nine new events were held, including two from the new [[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|cycling]] discipline of [[BMX]]. Women competed in the {{convert|3000|m|ft|0|adj=mid|sp=us}} [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] for the first time. [[Open water swimming]] events for men and women, over the distance of {{convert|10|km|mi|sp=us}}, were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2008/08/10/2008-08-10_a_2008_summer_olympics_primer.html|title=A 2008 Summer Olympics primer|date=10 August 2008|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=8 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225174703/https://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/2008-summer-olympics-primer-article-1.313803|archive-date=25 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In [[fencing]], the women's team foil and women's team saber replaced men's team foil and women's team [[épée]].{{efn|The fencing program included six individual events and four team events; the [[Fédération Internationale d'Escrime|FIE]]'s rules call for the set of team events to be different from those held in the previous Games and for at least one team event in each weapon to be contested.

The 2008 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony concluded the Beijing Games on 24 August 2008. It began at 8:00&nbsp;pm China Standard Time (UTC+8), and took place at the Beijing National Stadium.

The Ceremony included handover of the Games from Beijing to London. [[Guo Jinlong]], the [[Mayor of Beijing]] handed over the [[Olympic flag]] to the Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]], followed by a performance organized by [[LOCOG]] (London Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games).

=== National participation changes ===
[[File:Flag of Chinese Taipei for Olympic games.svg|thumb|Flag of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee.]]
Athletes from the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) competed at the 2008 Games as [[Chinese Taipei]] (TPE) under the [[Chinese Taipei Olympic flag]] and used the [[National Banner Song]] as their official anthem. The participation of Taiwan was briefly in doubt because of disagreements over the name of their team in the Chinese language and concerns about Taiwan marching in the Opening Ceremony next to the special administrative region of Hong Kong. A compromise on the naming was reached, and Taiwan was referred to during the games as "Chinese Taipei," rather than "Taipei, China," as the mainland China government had proposed. In addition, the [[Central African Republic at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Central African Republic]] was placed between Chinese Taipei and the Special Administrative Regions during the march of nations.<ref>{{cite news | last = Callick | first = Rowan | title = Taiwan clears Games hurdle | work = The Australian | date = 4 August 2008 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24123163-5013406,00.html | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120526213717/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24123163-5013406,00.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 26 May 2012 | accessdate = 15 June 2009 }}</ref>

[[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]] was due to take part in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.

=== Participation of athletes with disabilities ===
South African swimmer [[Natalie du Toit]], whose left leg was amputated following a motor scooter accident, qualified to compete at the Beijing Olympics. The five time gold medalist at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics|Athens Paralympics in 2004]] made history by becoming the first [[amputee]] to qualify for the Olympic Games since [[Olivér Halassy]] in 1936. She was able to compete in the Olympics rather than the Paralympics because she does not use a prosthetic leg while swimming.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hart |first=Simon |title=Dreams carry Natalie Du Toit to Beijing |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=4 May 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/swimming/2299269/Dreams-carry-Natalie-Du-Toit-to-Beijing.html |accessdate=15 June 2009 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530170103/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/swimming/2299269/Dreams-carry-Natalie-Du-Toit-to-Beijing.html |archive-date=30 May 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Polish athlete [[Natalia Partyka]], who was born without a right forearm, competed in Table Tennis in the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Paralympic Games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london2012.com/blog/2008/06/18/natalia-paralympic-and-olympic-athlete.php |title=Natalia: Paralympic AND Olympic athlete |accessdate=15 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120906040512/http://www.london2012.com/about-us/our-vision/blog-archive/blog=natalia-paralympic-and-olympic-athlete/ |archive-date=6 September 2012  }}</ref>

The games were hit by a number of doping scandals before and after the games had commenced. Since seven Russian track and field stars were suspended just before the start of the games for allegedly tampering with their urine samples, only five of the seven who were due to take part in the games could participate. Eleven Greek weightlifters also failed tests in the run up to the games and the entire Bulgarian weightlifting team had to withdraw after eleven of their weightlifters also failed tests. A small number of athletes from other nations also failed pre-games tests.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/weightlifting/7477827.stm |title=Bulgaria withdraws lifting team |work=BBC Sport |date=27 June 2008 |accessdate=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226184403/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/weightlifting/7477827.stm |archive-date=26 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/weightlifting/7330927.stm |title=Greek 'B' samples test positive |work=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2008 |accessdate=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408073929/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/weightlifting/7330927.stm |archive-date=8 April 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/7679893.stm |title=Seven Russians handed doping bans |work=BBC Sport |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023172031/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/7679893.stm |archive-date=23 October 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Urine samples taken from the games were reanalyzed in 2016–17 using more advanced technologies that were not available at the time of competition. 61 athletes failed these re-tests, and 50 medals being stripped.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The [[Economic history of the People's Republic of China|long-term economic impact]] of the games on China and Beijing in particular is not yet clear. Some sectors of the economy may have benefited from the influx of tourists, and other sectors such as manufacturing lost revenue because of plant closings related to the government's efforts to improve air quality. Four years after the Games, many of the specially constructed facilities were underused or even deserted.<ref>{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Mark|title='Ruin Porn' — the Aftermath of the Beijing Olympics|date=15 July 2012|url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/ruin-porn-the-aftermath-of-the-beijing-olympics|accessdate=21 July 2012|work=The New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719133617/http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/ruin-porn-the-aftermath-of-the-beijing-olympics/|archive-date=19 July 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>  It is generally expected by economists that there will be no lasting effects on Beijing's economy from the games.<ref name="legacy5">{{cite news|title=Beijing's economy – Going for gold |date=25 August 2008 |url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11920899 |accessdate=29 August 2008 |work=The Economist |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828170049/http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11920899 |archive-date=28 August 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

One 2009 study found that countries which host the Olympics experience a significant boost in trade.  But this is also the case for countries which merely bid to host.  "The benefit, in other words, came from the signal that a country was open for business, not from the spending itself."

On how hosting boosts trade as does merely bidding to host, the article cites economists Andrew K. Rose at the University of California, Berkeley, and Mark M. Spiegel at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.</ref>

Seven years after the 2008 Games, Beijing was awarded the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]. It will thus be the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Games.
