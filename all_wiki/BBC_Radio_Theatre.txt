The '''BBC Radio Theatre''' (originally named '''The Concert Hall''') is a theatre situated within the [[BBC]]'s [[Broadcasting House]] complex. It is used for live broadcast and audio recordings.

== History ==
Originally named '''The Concert Hall''', the theatre was designed by [[George Val Myer]] as part of the [[BBC]]'s new [[Broadcasting House]] building.<ref name="Beckwith LG">{{cite web |last1=Beckwith |first1=Roger |title=Lower Ground Floor |url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/bh32/bh32_lg.htm |website=www.orbem.co.uk |publisher=Old BBC Radio Broadcasting Equipment and Memories |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref> The hall is {{convert|106|ft}} long, and tapers from {{convert|48|ft}} wide at the rear to {{convert|36|ft}} wide behind the stage. The room's height is {{convert|31|ft}}, taking up three storeys of Broadcasting House.<ref name="Beckwith LG" /> Upon original specification, the hall had a [[reverberation time]] of 1.7 seconds.<ref name="Beckwith LG" />

Broadcasting House was opened on 14 May 1932 by Queen [[Mary of Teck]].<ref name="BBC BH Opens">{{cite web |title=BBC – History of the BBC, Broadcasting House opens 14 May 1932 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01z12dt |website=BBC Online |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref> The theatre's first performance was held on 15 October 1932; at this time the hall's capacity allowed a large orchestra and an audience of 550.<ref name="Beckwith LG" /> On 10 March 1933, the hall hosted a memorial concert to the BBC's former Director of Music, [[Percy Pitt]].<ref name="DoctorDoctor1999">{{cite book|author=Jennifer Ruth|title=The BBC and Ultra-Modern Music, 1922–1936: Shaping a Nation's Tastes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVCtkShvDSkC&pg=PA467|accessdate=11 November 2019|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66117-1|page=467}}</ref>

In 1933, the BBC ''Yearbook'' described the hall's [[acoustics]] and architecture:
{{cquote|In the design of public concert halls a difficulty frequently encountered is the variability of the reverberation time according to the size of the audience, owing to the sound-absorbing properties of the latter [...] This difficulty has to a very large extent been avoided by providing heavily upholstered seats for the audience and by carpeting the space occupied by the orchestra. The upholstery and carpets provide sufficient sound absorption in themselves, and conditions are not greatly altered when the upholstered seats are occupied.<ref name="Beckwith LG" />}}

Val Myer's interior included extensive [[Art Deco]] fittings, an oak [[dado (architecture)|dado]] and [[bas-relief]]s by [[Gilbert Bayes]].<ref name="Beckwith LG" /> The theatre's [[green room]] was designed by [[Raymond McGrath]].<ref name="Beckwith LG" />

Upon the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], part of the theatre was used as a dormitory.<ref name="Beckwith LG" /> On 6 September 1939, [[Stuart Hibberd]] wrote that:

{{cquote|Wakened by sirens at 6.50 a.m. in Broadcasting House, I scrambled into some clothes and went to the concert hall now being used as the main shelter for those on duty. One end of it had been converted into a dormitory, in which twenty or thirty people were asleep. The other was filled with people sitting and standing around in groups, dressed in all sorts of garment: girls in dressing-gowns of various hues, some thirty or more charladies, some with their mops and buckets, and engineers and programme staff on duty, like myself. We sat there for two hours before the 'All Clear' went; then there was a stampede to the canteen for breakfast, and of course nothing was ready.<ref name="Beckwith LG" />}}

In 1966, the BBC commissioned a report into [[sound propagation]] between spaces inside Broadcasting House, entitled ''Acoustic Tests in Broadcasting House, London: The Anomalous Sound Transmission between Studio S2 and the Concert Hall''. The investigation found that Studio S2—situated in the sub basement below the Concert Hall<ref name="Beckwith SB">{{cite web |last1=Beckwith |first1=Roger |title=The Sub-Basement |url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/bh32/bh32_sb.htm |website=www.orbem.co.uk |publisher=Old BBC Radio Broadcasting Equipment and Memories |accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref> and used for small orchestras and pop groups—leaked sound into the auditorium above due to inadequate [[sound insulation]] and lack of a [[floating floor]]; this occasionally distracted musicians in the Concert Hall although it could not be heard on transmissions or recordings.<ref name="BBC Report 1966 1">{{cite web |last1=Gilford |first1=C.L.S. |last2=Burd |first2=A.N. |title=ACOUSTIC TESTS IN BROADCASTING HOUSE, LONDON: THE ANOMALOUS SOUND TRANSMISSION BETWEEN STUDIO S2 AND THE CONCERT HALL |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1966-21.pdf |website=BBC Online |publisher=BBC Research Department |accessdate=12 November 2019 |page=1 |date=21 January 1966}}</ref>

In 1994, the Concert Hall was renamed the Radio Theatre.<ref name="Hines2008">{{cite book|author=Mark Hines|title=The Story of Broadcasting House: Home of the BBC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sc7nPAAACAAJ|accessdate=11 November 2019|year=2008|publisher=Merrell|isbn=978-1-85894-421-0|page=121}}</ref>

On 16 June 1933, the BBC unveiled the Concert Hall's [[Compton organ]]. To celebrate the event, the corporation broadcast a concert featuring [[George Thalben-Ball]], [[G. D. Cunningham]], and [[Walter Alcock]]. The organ featured 2,826 [[organ pipe|pipes]] in 35 [[Organ stop|rank]]s.<ref name="Beckwith LG" />
