'''Digital Spy''' is a British-based entertainment, television and film website and brand and is the largest digital property at [[Hearst UK]]. Since its launch in 1999, 'DS' has focused on entertainment news related to television programmes, films, music and show business to a global audience.

As well as breaking news, in-depth features, reviews and authoritative editorial explainers, the site also features the DS [[Internet forum|Forum]].

==History==
===digiNews (1999)===
In early January 1999, Iain Chapman launched the digiNEWS website, providing news, rumours and information on Sky's new digital satellite platform [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|SkyDigital]]. At the same time, Chris Butcher launched the ONfaq website, offering similar news and information on the UK's new digital terrestrial platform [[ITV Digital|ONdigital]]. Both sites proved to be popular, attracting a lot of attention from visitors eager for more news about these rapidly developing TV platforms. Very quickly, Iain and Chris discussed the idea of a merger of the two sites, to create the digiNEWS Network. [[File:Digital Spy Logo.svg|right|thumb|200px|Original Digital Spy logo used from 1999 until 2013]]On 28 February 1999, digiNEWS and ONfaq merged and were rebranded as sites of the new 'digiNEWS network'. More websites joined the network, including Chris Norris's cablenews:uk (covering NTL and TeleWest cable services), Mark Hughes' DVDNews (DVD news and reviews) and Neil Wilkes' TV:uk (TV news and gossip). While the network grew, it was still served from personal webspace from ISPs such as Freeserve, so discussions with website guru Jose Cardoso began and work started on integrating the multitude of sites into a single portal.

It was important for the new site to be easily accessible, so a .COM address was preferable but the diginews.com address was already taken. After many many emails back and forth, the name 'Digital Spy' was chosen.

===Digital Spy (2000–2011)===
The Digital Spy forums first went live on 1 March 2000, built on the UBB forum platform. The newly named 'Digital Spy' news portal went live on 19 May 2001, running on a custom-built content management system called RAMS (Remote Article Management System).

Digital Spy Limited was incorporated in late 2001<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04270534/filing-history|title=Companies House Incorporation for Digital Spy|publisher=Registrar of Companies|location=UK}}</ref> by Alan Jay, Neil Wilkes and Mark Hughes, with Ian Chapman, Jose Cardoso and James Welsh joining later as shareholders.

On 9 April 2008, it was announced that the website had been purchased by magazine publisher [[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]], a subsidiary of the [[Lagardère Group]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2008/04/09/afx4871332.html|title=Lagardere buys UK web portal Digitalspy.co.uk|date=9 April 2008|work=Forbes|publisher=[[Thomson Financial News]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717175742/https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2008/04/09/afx4871332.html|archive-date=July 17, 2008|accessdate=9 April 2008}}</ref> for a "significant" sum.<ref name="independent">{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Ciar|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/hachette-spies-a-good-match-with-a-digital-duo-816398.html|title=Hachette spies a good match with a digital duo|date=28 April 2008|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=29 April 2008|location=London}}</ref>
