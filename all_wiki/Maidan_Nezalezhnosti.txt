'''Maidan Nezalezhnosti''' ({{lang-uk|Майдан Незалежності}} {{IPA-uk|mɐjˈdɑn nezɐˈlɛʒnosʲtʲi|}}, literally "'''Independence Square'''") is the central [[town square|square]]<ref>Kyiv: Encyclopedic Handbook. Main Edition of Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia. Kyiv 1982</ref> of [[Kyiv]], the capital city of [[Ukraine]]. One of the city's main squares, it is located on [[Khreshchatyk Street]] in the [[Shevchenko Raion, Kyiv|Shevchenko Raion]]. The square has been known under many different names, but often it is called simply ''Maidan'' ("square").

{{External media
|image1 = [http://ruslanstory.com/wp-content/gallery/lpg/dsc_9112.jpg Maidan] 
}}

In the 19th century, the square contained buildings of the city council and noble assembly.

Since the start of [[History of Ukraine|Ukraine's independence movement in 1990]], the square has been the traditional place for political rallies, including four large-scale radical protest campaigns: the 1990 student "[[Revolution on Granite]]", the 2001 "[[Ukraine without Kuchma]]", the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]], and the 2013–14 [[Euromaidan]].<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/why-ukraine-is-so-important-2014-1 Why Ukraine Is So Important], [[Business Insider]] (28 January 2014)<br>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2DI9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA154&dq=%22Revolution+on+Granite%22+Ukraine&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFxt3g___XAhXpK8AKHc-vA38Q6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=%22Revolution%20on%20Granite%22%20Ukraine&f=false The Process of Politicization: How Much Politics Does a Society Need?], [[Cambridge Scholars Publishing]], 2017, {{ISBN|1-4438-9628-4}} (page 154)<br>[https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/tom-junes/where-does-key-to-political-change-in-post-soviet-space-lie Where does the key to political change lie in the post-Soviet space?], [[openDemocracy]] (23 August 2016)</ref> Maidan is also a regular site for non-political displays and events, however since 2014 most of them were moved to Sofiyivska Square or elsewhere, because making entertainment on a place [[List of people killed during Euromaidan|where people were killed]] during [[Euromaidan]] was considered inappropriate. Most notably, Christmas Fairs and New Year celebrations were moved to Sofiyivska Square.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tyzhden.ua/News/150773|script-title=uk:Київська влада оприлюднила план святкування Нового року та Різдва|language=Ukrainian|trans-title=Kyiv government published the plan of New Year and Christmas celebrations|date=6 November 2015|publisher=Тиждень.ua|access-date=14 January 2019|quote=But, like in previous year, considering the events of winter of 2013-2014, no celebrations are planned on Maidan Nezalezhnosti.}}</ref>

==Names==
The square received its current name in 1991, in the aftermath of the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]] and the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)#Yeltsin and the dissolution of the USSR|collapse of the Soviet Union]].
''[[:wikt:майдан#Ukrainian|Maidan]]'' is a Ukrainian word for "square, open space", with widely used equivalents in the Middle East and South Asia to refer to an open space in or near a town, used as a parade ground or for events such as public meetings. It has similar forms in [[Urdu]] {{lang|ur|میدان}} (''maidān''), and its source, [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|میدان}} (''meydân'', "town-square or central place of gathering"), from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|مَيْدَان}} (''maydān''), itself an [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] borrowing  ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{lang|ine|*médʰyos}}. Compare [[Avestan]] {{lang|ae-Latn|maiδya}}, [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|मध्य}} (''madhya'') and Latin {{lang|la|medius}}. The word also was borrowed into neighboring [[Turkic languages]], as in the [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{lang|tr|meydan}}, which are the likely sources of the borrowing into Ukrainian.

Timeline of the square's names:
* 1869: [[Khreshchatyk]] Square (Khreshchatitskaya ploshchad)
* 1876: [[City Duma|Council (Parliament)]] Square (Dumskaya ploshchad)
* 1919: [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet]] Square (Sovetskaya ploshchad)
* 1935: [[Mikhail Kalinin|Kalinin]] Square (Ploshchad Kalinina)
* 1941: Council (Parliament) Square (Dumska ploshcha)
* 1943: Kalinin Square (Ploshchad Kalinina)
* 1977: Square of the [[October Revolution]] (Russian: Ploshchad Oktyabrskoi Revolutsyi, Ukrainian: Ploshcha Zhovtnevoyi revolyutsii)
* 1991: [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Independence]] Square (Maidan Nezalezhnosti)

City squares called ''Maidan Nezalezhnosti'' are also found in [[Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine|Khmelnytskyi]]<ref>{{coord|49.419|N|26.979|E|}}, formerly "Lenin Square" ({{lang|uk|площа Леніна}}, 1967).</ref> and [[Sumy]].<ref>{{coord|50.912|N|34.804|E|}}, formerly  "Lenin Square" ({{lang|uk|площа Леніна}}, 1970).</ref>
[[Kropyvnytskyi]], [[Kremenchuk]] and [[Odessa]] have "Independent Squares" named ''Ploshcha Nezalezhnosti'' (using the more familiar ''[[:wikt:площа|ploshcha]]'' rather than ''maidan'' for "square").

==Location==
Independence Square is one of three squares located along [[Khreshchatyk]], close to the northeastern end of the street. It is situated close to [[European Square, Kyiv|European Square]], which is the terminal end of Khreshchatyk. Besides Khreshchatyk, which splits the square in half, several other streets lead to the square. These include Architect Horodecki Street, Institute Street, Michael Street, Kosciol Street, Minor Zhytomyr Street, Sophia Street, Taras Shevchenko Lane, and Boris Hrinchenko Street.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The square itself is a multi-level location. At ground level is the intersection of Khreshchatyk, which splits Institute Street (vulytsia Instytutska), and Michael Street (vulytsia Mykhailivska). Underneath the square, the [[Obolonsko–Teremkivska line]] of the [[Kyiv Metro]] stretches across with its station [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Kyiv Metro)|Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] located underground.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Also the "Hlobus" mall is situated underneath the square.

==History==

=== Early history and Tsarist Russia===
Until the 10th century, the future square's site, as well as the rest of Khreshchatyk, was called ''Perevisyshch''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was located just to the south of the Kyiv City, beyond which were located territories of the Cave Monastery (Kyiv-Pechersky) along the [[Dnipro River]].

At the lower end of Sofiivska vulytsia (Sofia Street), which led to the High City, stood one of the three main gates of [[Old Kyiv]] (Yaroslav's City), the Lyadski Gates; the other two were the [[Golden Gate, Kyiv|Golden Gates]] and Zhydivski Gates. Those gates are also mentioned in 1151, and around them lived the Polish population of the city, Lacka Sloboda. The Lyadksi Gates were destroyed during the storm of city by the Mongol army of [[Batu Khan]] in 1240.

Sometime during the 18th century, the new Pecherski Gates were erected; they stood until 1833. Until the early 19th century, the area was a low-lying vacant ground known as ''Goat Swamp'' (''Kozyne Boloto'').

In the 1830s, the first wooden dwellings were built on the site, and in the 1850s stone buildings appeared. The most famous Ukrainian writer, [[Taras Shevchenko]] lived in that area in 1859, in a building between Mala Zhytomyrska (Little Zhytomyr) and Mykhailivska vulytsia (Michael's Street).

Development rapidly intensified after the mid-19th century, when the territory gradually became the commercial center of Kyiv, which underwent an immense boom during the Russian [[Industrial Revolution]], becoming the third most important city in the [[Russian Empire]]. Until 1871, it was called the ''Khreshchatitskaya Ploshchad'' (Khreshchatyk Square); it was a location for the local market and folk entertainment. In 1876, the [[Kyiv City Duma building]] was built here, and the area became known as the Dumskaya Ploshchad ([[Duma]] Square). A line from the [[Kyiv tram]], the first electric tram built in the Russian Empire (opened 1892) reached the square in 1894.

In 1913, in front of the City Duma, a monument of [[Pyotr Stolypin]] (who was assassinated in Kyiv in 1911) was constructed, and it stood there until March 1917 at the dawn of the Revolutionary war within the Empire.

===Soviet prewar years===
[[File:Kyiv-city-duma-1941.jpg|thumb|275px|Much of the square was destroyed in the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}]]
In 1919, the square was renamed ''Soviet Square''. From 1935, it was called ''Kalinin Square'', after [[Mikhail Kalinin]], the first chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]].

===Soviet postwar years===
During the first couple of years after the war, the square was completely rebuilt from scratch. It was architecturally integrated with the newly constructed Khreshchatyk in the typical (for the time) [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] [[Stalinist architecture]]. The newly constructed Kyiv ''Central Post Office'' and ''Trade-Union House'' with its high-rise clock located in the square, is very well known and frequently appears in pictures of the center of the city.

In 1976-77, as a part of metro construction, much of the square was again rebuilt, and it was renamed  ''October Revolution Square'' (Ploshcha Zhovtnevoyi revolyutsii). During the reconstruction, the massive [[cubism|cubist]] monument to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]] was put up as was the complex ensemble of fountains.

During the Soviet period, the square was used for demonstrations and parades in honor of [[International Workers' Day|May 1]] (until 1969), [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] and the [[October Revolution]].

===Independent Ukraine===
[[File:TreeAlleyMaidan.jpg|thumb|275px|Alley of trees on Maidan Nezalezhnosti]]
After [[History of Ukraine#Independent Ukraine|Ukraine's independence in 1991]], the square was given its current name. The competing proposal of ''Liberty Square'' (Ploshcha Svobody) was raised at the time as well as in the years to follow, but the current name commemorating the Ukrainian independence is now firmly associated with the square (''see [[#Symbol of political activity|the section below]]'').

In 2001, as the square was the major center of the "[[Ukraine without Kuchma]]" mass protest campaign, the new extensive construction of the area was abruptly ordered by the Kyiv mayor of the time, [[Oleksandr Omelchenko]]. The square was fenced off for construction and became inaccessible for the protesters and many observers claimed that the main goal of the project ordered by the city mayor was to disrupt the

Following the construction, the old familiar look of the square, with its many fountains, was significantly altered and the public reaction to the new look of the square was mixed at first.<ref>Aristova, Natalia. "Maidan Nezalezhnosti: Everything will be not so" in ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli]]'', 15–21 June 2006. Available in [http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/ie/show/397/35063 Russian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311134047/http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/ie/show/397/35063 |date=11 March 2007 }} and [http://www.zn.kiev.ua/nn/show/397/35063/ in Ukrainian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526011251/http://www.zn.kiev.ua/nn/show/397/35063/ |date=26 May 2006 }}</ref> However, by now the square's monument to [[Kyi, Schek and Khoryv]], the legendary founders of Kyiv, the folklore hero [[Cossack Mamay]], the city's historic protector [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] as well as a more modern invention, the protecting goddess [[Berehynia]], and the many glass domes are easily recognisable as parts of the modern city centre.

A mostly underground shopping mall called ''Hlobus'' was built under the square to replace the old and shabby giant underpass formerly dubbed by Kyivans as "Truba" (the Tube).

Trade-Unions House was severely damaged during the fire in February 2014, so later it went through a reconstruction.

Future developments of the square include the demolition of the old "Ukrayina" hotel (formerly hotel "Moskva"), and building a new 68-floor building instead.

==Symbol of political activity==
As the central Kyiv square, following the end of Soviet era the Maidan has been the centre of public political activity. In the autumn of 1990, students' protests and [[hunger strike]]s also known as the [[Revolution on Granite]] at the Maidan resulted in the resignation of the Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR [[Vitaliy Masol]].<ref>[http://m.day.kyiv.ua/en/article/day-after-day/lesson-revolution-granite The lesson of the Revolution on Granite], [[Den (newspaper)|Den]] (4 October 2016)</ref><ref>{{in lang|uk}}

In the 2000s, the biggest political protests in Ukraine, such as the ''[[Ukraine without Kuchma]]'' campaign and the [[Orange Revolution]] took place in this square. During the ''Orange Revolution'' in late 2004, Maidan Nezalezhnosti received global media coverage, as hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in the square and nearby streets, and pitched tents for several weeks, enduring the cold and snow. One of the eminent activists during that time became [[Paraska Korolyuk]]. The protests against [[electoral fraud]] resulted in an additional round of presidential elections being ordered by the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]], which were won by the opposition candidate, [[Viktor Yushchenko]].

Following his election as the [[President of Ukraine]], and after taking the official oath in the [[Verkhovna Rada|parliament]], Yushchenko took a public oath at Maidan Nezalezhnosti in front of his numerous supporters.

After the [[Orange Revolution]], Maidan Nezalezhnosti continues to attract political protesters, but no protest related event has ever approached the scale of the Orange protests.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/91316/ Tax code protests intensify], [[Kyiv Post]] (26 November 2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/91790/ Update: Yanukovych vetoes tax code after protests], [[Kyiv Post]] (30 November 2010)<br>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_general/detail/91755/ Yanukovych vetoes the tax code], [[Kyiv Post]] (30 November 2010)</ref> Mass rallies for political candidates, however, have attracted large numbers, with the 2009 "Batkivshchyna" party congress (during which Yulia Tymoshenko was nominated as a candidate for president) being a notable example that brought nearly 200,000 people to the square.

[[File:Victory day Kiev 2.jpg|thumb|A color guard marching during the [[2010 Kyiv Victory Day Parade]] while carrying the banners of [[Red Army]] units based in the [[Ukrainian SSR]].]]

The square was the site of [[Euromaidan]] protests beginning in November 2013, progressing to violent clashes, fires, and ending in the February [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]].<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/euromaidan-rallies-in-ukraine-live-updates-332341.html Live updates of the protests],  [[Kyiv Post]] (27, 28 & 29 November 2013)<br>[http://www.euronews.com/2013/11/26/students-in-ukraine-threaten-indefinite-national-strike/ Students in Ukraine threaten indefinite national strike], [[Euronews]] (26 November 2013)<br>[http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2013/11/27/7003276/ Students from various cities across Ukraine are joining the protests], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (27 November 2013)<br>[http://www.euronews.com/2013/11/27/protests-continue-in-kyiv-ahead-of-vilnius-eu-summit/ Protests continue in Kyiv ahead of Vilnius EU summit], [[Euronews]] (27 November 2013)<br>[http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-protests-generational-divide/25182439.html In Ukraine, Protests Highlight 'Generational Rift' ], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (27 November 2013)<br>[http://www.euronews.com/2013/11/29/ukraine-tension-in-kyiv-as-pro-and-anti-government-protesters-hold-rallies/ Ukraine: tension in Kyiv as pro and anti government protesters hold rallies], [[Euronews]] (29 November 2013)<br>[http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/20081107/ukraine-opposition-demands-leader-resign-after-eu-snub/ Ukraine opposition demands leader resign after EU snub] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204011730/http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/20081107/ukraine-opposition-demands-leader-resign-after-eu-snub/ |date=4 December 2013 }}, [[Seven News]] (30 November 2013)</ref> The square was covered in protesters all day and night since 1 December 2013.<ref name="Reuters- dead man">{{cite news|title=Dead man found hanging on Kiev's Independence Square - police|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-tree-idUSBREA0Q0RK20140127|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=27 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174412/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-tree-idUSBREA0Q0RK20140127|archive-date=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref name="Legge- Dead man">{{cite news|last=Legge|first=James|title=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315183447/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-protests-police-forced-to-abandon-kiev-conference-centre-to-opposition-as-presidents-latest-9090559.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=28 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="Kyiv Post">{{cite news|title=Police: Dead body found hanging on New Year tree in Kyiv|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/police-dead-body-found-hanging-on-new-year-tree-in-kyiv-335669.html|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=27 January 2014}}</ref> On 27 January 2014, Ukrainian police reported a 55-year-old man from [[Western Ukraine]] found dead hanging from the framework of a huge artificial 'New Year tree' in central Kyiv.
