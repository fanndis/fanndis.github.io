On 11 May 2013, the new chief executive [[Stuart Gulliver]] announced that HSBC would refocus its business strategy and that a large-scale retrenchment of operations, particularly in respect of the retail sector, was planned. HSBC would no longer seek to be 'the world's local bank', as costs associated with this were spiralling and US$3.5 billion needed to be saved by 2013, with the aim of bringing overheads down from 55% of revenues to 48%. In 2010, then-chairman [[Stephen Green, Baron Green of Hurstpierpoint|Stephen Green]] planned to depart HSBC to accept a government appointment in the Trade Ministry. Group Chief Executive [[Michael Geoghegan]] was expected to become the next chairman. However, while many current and former senior employees supported the tradition of promoting the chief executive to chairman, many shareholders instead pushed for an external candidate.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8019235/HSBC-investors-against-Michael-Geoghegan-becoming-chairman.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=Harry | last1=Wilson | first2=Sean | last2=Farrell | first3=Philip | last3=Aldrick | title=HSBC investors against Michael Geoghegan becoming chairman | date=22 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/business/hsbc-chief-michael-geoghegan-to-quit-after-failing-to-get-top-job/story-e6frfm1i-1225928665163 | work=NewsCore | title=HSBC chief Michael Geoghegan 'to quit' after failing to get top job | date=24 September 2010}}</ref> HSBC's board of directors had reportedly been split over the succession planning and investors were alarmed that the row would damage the company.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8021673/Douglas-Flint-to-be-HSBC-chairman-Michael-Geoghegan-to-leave-in-radical-reshuffle.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Wilson | title=Douglas Flint to be HSBC chairman, Michael Geoghegan to leave in radical reshuffle | date=23 September 2010}}</ref>

In September 2008, HSBC announced that it would combine its two Swiss private banks under one brand name in 2009, with HSBC Guyerzeller and HSBC Private Bank to be merged into one [[Legal personality|legal entity]], under the newly appointed CEO of HSBC Private Bank, Alexandre Zeller.<ref>[http://www.hsbc.guyerzeller.com/files/pdf/en/press_20080917.pdf Press Clippings, HSBC Guyerzeller website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923184838/http://www.hsbc.guyerzeller.com/files/pdf/en/press_20080917.pdf |date=23 September 2008 }}</ref>

Retail Banking and Wealth Management (also known as RBWM) was previously referred to as Personal Financial Services (PFS). This rename was announced during HSBC's 2011 Investor Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsbc.com/1/content/assets/investor_relations/strategy_day/2011/110511_strategy_day_overview_transcript.pdf |title=Strategy Day |accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref>

====Group service centers====

As a cost-saving measure HSBC is [[offshoring]] processing work to lower cost economies in order to reduce the cost of providing services in developed countries. These locations take on work such as [[data processing]] and [[customer service]], but also internal [[software engineering]] at [[Pune]] (India), [[Gurgaon, Haryana|Gurgaon]] (India), [[Bangalore, Karnataka|Bangalore]] (India), [[Chennai, Tamil Nadu|Chennai]] (India), [[Hyderabad, Telangana|Hyderabad]] (India), [[Vishakhapatnam]] (India), [[Kolkata]] (India), [[Guangzhou]] (China), [[Curitiba]] (Brazil) and [[Kuala Lumpur]] (Malaysia). Chief Operating Officer Alan Jebson said in March 2005 that he would be very surprised if fewer than 25,000 people were working in the centers over the next three years: "I don't have a precise target but I would be surprised if we had less than 15 (global service centers) in three years' time." He went on to say that each centre cost the bank from $20m to $30m to set up, but that for every job moved the bank saves about $20,000 (£10,400).<ref name="bbc1">{{Cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4353423.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=HSBC bank 'to offshore more jobs' | date=16 March 2005}}</ref> [[Trades union]]s, particularly in the UK and US, blame these centers for job losses in developed countries, and also for the effective imposition of wage caps on their members.<ref name="bbc1" />

In December 2012, Assistant U.S. Attorney General [[Lanny A.

The group announced in November 1998 that the HSBC brand and the hexagon symbol would be adopted as the unified brand in all the markets where HSBC operates, with the aim of enhancing recognition of the group and its values by customers, shareholders and staff throughout the world. The hexagon symbol was originally adopted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation as its logo in 1983. It was developed from the bank's house [[flag]], a white rectangle divided diagonally to produce a red [[hourglass (sandglass)|hourglass]] shape. Like many other Hong Kong company flags that originated in the 19th century, and because of its founder's nationality, the design was based on the [[Saltire|cross]] of [[Saint Andrew]]. The logo was designed by Austrian graphic artist [[Henry Steiner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HSBC Logo|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/hsbc-logo|publisher=FamousLogos.net|accessdate=24 January 2012}}</ref>

In 2018, HSBC made minor changes to their logo.
