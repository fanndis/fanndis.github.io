'''Instax''' (stylized as '''instax''') is a brand of [[Instant camera|instant still cameras]] and [[instant film]]s marketed by [[Fujifilm]].

The [[Film format|formats]] of Instax film give an image size of {{convert|46|x|62|mm|in|abbr=on}} for the Mini, {{convert|99|x|62|mm|in|abbr=on|lk=on}} for the Wide and {{convert|62|x|62|mm|in|abbr=on|lk=on}} for the Square. The Instax colour film is available in Mini, Wide, and Square formats and the black and white Instax Monochrome is available in Mini and Wide formats.

Other manufacturers also make compatible cameras and camera backs.

==Cameras and printers==
{{Main|List of Instax cameras and printers}}
Fujifilm produces a range of Instax Mini and Instax Wide cameras, as do other manufacturers. Fujifilm also produces Instax Mini printers and has in the past produced Instax Pivi printers.

== Film characteristics ==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Fuji's instant film products are based upon the improvements made to [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]]'s [[Polaroid SX-70|SX-70]] instant film system that the [[Eastman Kodak Company]] [[Instant film#Kodak|sold in the 1970s and 1980s]] – namely the ability to expose the film through the rear of the photograph and the reversal of the dye layers' order so that development in the blue layer is visible first. As a result of these changes, the image does not need to be taken via a [[Single-lens reflex camera#Optical components|reflex mirror]] in order to reverse the image (as all Polaroid [[Instant camera|integral film cameras]] do). Colour balance and tonal range are also improved over Polaroid integral [[instant film]]s. Fuji's decision to integrate the pressure plate springs and batteries into the camera bodies rather than the disposable film pack itself helps make the Instax system more economical per exposure than Polaroid's equivalents.

=== Instax Mini ===
[[File:Fuji Instax mini 8 (16267984790).jpg|thumb|Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 camera]]
[[File:Instax mini film.jpg|thumb|Packs of Instax Mini film]]
Instax Mini is a {{convert|54|x|86|mm|in|abbr=on}} (approximately [[ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1|ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 credit-card-size]]) integral daylight ISO 800 color film designed for use with Fujifilm instax mini compatible cameras. In Japan the Instax Mini cameras are called and referred to as cheki (チェキ without mini), after the sound of camera shutters, and instax mini 10/20/… is the model name.<ref name="instax">{{Cite web|title=インスタントカメラ【instax＜チェキ＞】公式サイト|url=https://instax.jp/|access-date=2020-10-06|website=instax.jp|language=ja}}</ref> Instax Mini is available in colour and black and white.

=== Digital Instax Pivi ===
The Digital Instax Pivi line was intended as a digital/analog hybrid. The original intention was to produce a new format to feed a series of digital instant cameras similar in approach to the [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] C-211, a digital camera with a built-in Polaroid 500 film [[Printer (computing)|printer]]. Fujifilm eventually released the FinePix PR21, a digital camera with a built-in Instax mini printer, in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.fujifilm.co.jp/news_r/nrj514.html | date = 1999 | title = FinePix PR21 JP press release}}</ref> A stand-alone printer was planned from the start but was not the primary focus, but this changed with the advent of mobile devices.{{cn|date=January 2017}} This device made it to market in 2004 (as the Pivi MP-100), after about five years in development.

Instax Pivi film looks physically identical to Instax mini, but it takes a different formulated film producing a color-inverted image when used in a mini camera, making them incompatible.

[[File:Fujifilm Instax 100.JPG|thumb|Instax 100 camera]]
Called Cheki Wide in Japan.
Released the year after the mini film and cameras, the negative was increased on this format to create an image size based on the [[golden ratio]].<ref name=JCII>{{cite web|title=23 "Japanese Historical Cameras" of 1999 Named|url=http://www.jcii-cameramuseum.jp/museum/historicalc_e/1999_e.html|website=JCII Camera Museum|publisher=Japan Camera Industry Institute|accessdate=26 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212205510/http://www.jcii-cameramuseum.jp/museum/historicalc_e/1999_e.html|archive-date=12 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Upon introduction, this format was simply called Instax without any suffix (making it the normal, not mini, Instax film), Fujifilm gradually embedded the "Wide" moniker into the name of the product. That rebranding pattern can also be seen on the Instax 210 which is now described on the Fujifilm web site as Instax Wide 210, despite not being referenced elsewhere in such a way.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.fujifilm.com/products/instant_photo/cameras/instax_210/ |date = October 2014 |title = Instax WIDE 210 product pagel |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031234456/http://www.fujifilm.com/products/instant_photo/cameras/instax_210/ |archive-date = 2014-10-31 }}</ref> Instax Wide is available in colour and black and white.

==History==
=== Pre-Instax ===
Kodak ceased production of instant film cameras when it was successfully sued by Polaroid for [[patent infringement]] in 1986. Fujifilm, through an agreement with Polaroid specifying they could not officially distribute in certain territories (such as the US) until the original [[patent]]s expired in the mid-1990s, continued to manufacture and market their own line of films. As such, Fuji produced several lines of instant films starting in the early 1980s.

=== Release ===
Instax was released to consumers in 1998<ref name=fujiInstant /><ref name=JCII /> and was based on those earlier instant film systems, having the same film speed and dye order.

Fujifilm originally wished to release the Instax series worldwide including North America and Europe simultaneously,<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/31/business/company-news-fuji-photo-may-enter-us-instant-film-market.html | date = 31 October 1998 | title = Fuji may enter US instant film market}}</ref> but chose to work with Polaroid on the mio camera based on the Instax mini 10/20 for the US market. The mio product was discontinued after a few years.

=== Polaroid withdraws ===
With Polaroid ceasing production of instant films in 2008, the Instax system was the only integral instant film system in production until Impossible Project (now [[Polaroid B.V.|Polaroid]] through brand acquisition) launched their integral film in early 2010. The Instax Mini system is also sold in some markets by Polaroid itself through the Polaroid 300<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polaroid.com/products/pic-300-instant-camera | accessdate = 4 September 2016 | title = Polaroid Pic-300 Instant Print Camera | publisher = [[Polaroid Corporation]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033452/http://polaroid.com/products/pic-300-instant-camera | archive-date = 1 December 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref> and Polaroid 300 Film<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polaroid.com/products/PIF-300-film | accessdate = 4 September 2016 | title = PIF-300 Instant Film for Pic-300 Instant Cameras | publisher = [[Polaroid Corporation]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171204082153/http://www.polaroid.com/products/PIF-300-film | archive-date = 4 December 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref> brands (in reality, rebranded Instax Mini 7S and Instax Mini film).

=== Reception and growing popularity ===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
In 2014 it was reported that the Instax Mini 8 was outselling flagship models like the [[Fujifilm X-T1]]<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-09-12|title=Instax Rules Them All: massive sales of Fuji's instax film.

In 2016 it was reported that sales of Instax cameras had risen to 5 million units the previous fiscal year, up from 100,000 units in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mogg|first=Trevor|date=April 5, 2016|title=Fujifilm’s Instax analog camera is outselling its digital devices by nearly 4 times|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/fujifilms-instax-analog-camera-outselling-its-digital-devices-by-nearly-four-times/|access-date=2020-10-06|website=www.digitaltrends.com}}</ref> Also that year, Fujifilm released a monochrome formulation of the film.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Jim|title=Fujifilm Instax Mini Monochrome|url=https://petapixel.com/2016/09/06/fujifilm-unveils-black-white-instax-mini-film/|accessdate=17 January 2017|publisher=PC Magazine|date=19 December 2016}}</ref>
