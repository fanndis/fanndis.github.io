"''Guǎng''" ({{zh|first=t|t=廣|s=广}}) means "wide" or "vast", and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in AD 226.<ref>{{cite book |title=Regional China: A Business and Economic Handbook |year=2013 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |author=Rongxing Gao |page=77 |isbn=9781137287670}}</ref> The name "''Guang''" ultimately came from Guangxin ({{zh|labels=no|first=t|t=廣信 |s=广信}}), an outpost established in [[Han dynasty]] near modern [[Wuzhou]], whose name is a reference to an order by [[Emperor Wu of Han]] to "widely bestow favors and sow trust".

===Prehistory===
The [[Neolithic]] era began in the [[Pearl River Delta]] ({{Lang|zh|珠江三角洲}}) 7,000 years before present (BP), with the early period from around 7000 to 5000 BP (c. 5050–3050 BC), and the late period from about 5000 to 3500 BP (c. 3050–1550 BC). In coastal Guangdong, the Neolithic was likely introduced from the middle Yangtze River area (Jiao 2013). In inland Guangdong, the neolithic appeared in Guangdong 4,600 years before present (BP). The Neolithic in northern inland Guangdong is represented by the [[Shixia culture]] ({{Lang|zh|石峽文化}}), which occurred from 4600 to 4200 BP (c. 2650–2250 BC).<ref>Jiao, Tianlong. 2013.

===Imperial===
Originally inhabited by a mixture of tribal groups known to the Chinese as the [[Baiyue]] ("Hundred Yue"), the region first became part of China during the [[Qin dynasty]]. Under the Qin Dynasty, Chinese administration began and along with it reliable historical records in the region. After establishing the first [[Qin's wars of unification|unified Chinese empire]], the Qin expanded southwards and set up Nanhai [[Commandery (China)|Commandery]] at [[Panyu District|Panyu]], near what is now part of Guangzhou. The region was an independent kingdom as [[Nanyue]] between the fall of Qin and the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]]. The [[Han dynasty]] administered Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam as [[Jiaozhi|Jiaozhi Province]], southernmost Jiaozhi Province was used as a gateway for traders from the west—as far away as the Roman Empire. Under the [[Eastern Wu|Wu Kingdom]] of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, Guangdong was made its own province, the Guang Province, in 226 CE.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Once known as Canton, the town was a prosperous port city along a tropical frontier region beset by disease and wild animals, but rich in oranges, [[banyan]], bananas, and [[lychee]] fruits, they traded slaves, silk and [[chinaware]]  with [[Persians]], [[Brahmans]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] in exchange for their renowned medicines and fragrant tropical woods. [[Shi'a Muslims]] who had fled persecution in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Buddhists]] from India lived side by side in the thriving town each erecting their own houses of worship. A foreign quarter sprang up along the [[Pearl River (China)|river]] where many traders of diverse backgrounds including Arabs, and [[Sinhalese people|Singhalese]] took up residence.<ref name="University of California Press">{{cite book |last1=Schafer |first1=Edward H. |title=The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of Tang Exotics |date=1963 |publisher=University of California Press |page=15 |isbn=978-0-520-05462-2}}</ref>

The port's importance declined after it was raided by Arabs and Persians in 758 and the foreign residents were at times troubled by the corrupt local officials, sometimes responding violently. During one incident in 684, for example, a merchant vessel's captain murdered a corrupt governor who had used his position to steal from the merchant.<ref name="University of California Press"/>

Together with [[Guangxi]], Guangdong was made part of [[Lingnan culture|Lingnan]] Circuit (political division Circuit), or Mountain-South Circuit, in 627 during the [[Tang dynasty]]. The Guangdong part of Lingnan Circuit was renamed [[Guangnan East Circuit]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|廣南東路}}) in 971 during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).

As time passed, the demographics of what is now Guangdong gradually shifted to ([[Han people|Han]]){{when|date=February 2020}} Chinese dominance as the populations intermingled due to commerce along the great canals, and abruptly shifted through massive migration from [[Northern China|the north]] during periods of political turmoil and nomadic incursions from the fall of the Han dynasty onwards. For example, internal strife in northern China following [[An Lushan Rebellion|the rebellion]] of [[An Lushan]] resulted in a 75% increase in the population of Guangzhou prefecture between the 740s–750s and 800s–810s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhyz.org/yxx/jxzy/zy/zy48.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030529135953/http://www.nhyz.org/yxx/jxzy/zy/zy48.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 May 2003 |title=nhyz.org |publisher=nhyz.org |accessdate=25 April 2012 }}</ref> As more migrants arrived, the local population was gradually [[Sinicization|assimilated to Han Chinese culture]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=11836649 |title=  Phylogeographic differentiation of mitochondrial DNA in Han Chinese|journal=  The American Journal of Human Genetics|date= March 2002|doi=10.1086/338999 |volume=70 |issue=3 |pmc=384943 |pages=635–51|last1=  Yao|first1=  Yong-Gang|last2=  Kong|first2=  Qing-Peng|last3=  Bandelt|first3=  Hans-Jürgen|last4=  Kivisild|first4=  Toomas|last5=  Zhang|first5=  Ya-Ping}}</ref> or displaced.

As [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|Mongols]] from the north engaged in their [[Mongol conquest of China|conquest of China]] in the 13th century, the [[Southern Song]] court fled southwards from its capital in [[Hangzhou]]. The defeat of the Southern Song court by Mongol naval forces in The [[Battle of Yamen]] 1279 in Guangdong marked the end of the Southern Song dynasty (960–1279).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://world.time.com/2013/06/15/exiled-in-hong-kong-famous-company-for-edward-snowden/slide/the-southern-sung-emperors/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 February 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829110014/http://world.time.com/2013/06/15/exiled-in-hong-kong-famous-company-for-edward-snowden/slide/the-southern-sung-emperors/ |archivedate=29 August 2017  }}</ref>

During the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], large parts of current Guangdong belonged to [[Jiangxi]].<ref>Zhang Tingyu, et al. (1739). "[[History of Ming]]". Vol. 45, ''Records XXI, Geography VI'': {{lang|zh-hant|廣東《禹貢》揚州之域及揚州徼外。元置廣東道宣慰使司，治廣州路。屬江西行中書省。|nocat=true}}{{in lang|zh}}</ref> Its present name, "Guangdong Province" was given in early [[Ming dynasty]].

Since the 16th century, Guangdong has had extensive trade links with the rest of the world. European merchants coming northwards via the [[Straits of Malacca]] and the [[South China Sea]], particularly the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and British, traded extensively through Guangzhou. [[Macau]], on the southern coast of Guangdong, was the first European settlement in 1557.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the 19th century, the [[opium trade]]d through Guangzhou triggered the [[First Opium War]], opening an era of Western imperialists' incursion and intervention in China. In addition to [[Macau]], which was then a [[History of Macau#Portuguese settlement|Portuguese colony]], Hong Kong was ceded to the British, and [[Guangzhouwan|Kwang-Chou-Wan]] (modern day area of [[Zhanjiang]]) to the French.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Due to the large number of people that emigrated out of the Guangdong province, and in particular the ease of immigration from Hong Kong to other parts of the [[British Empire]](later [[British Commonwealth]]), many overseas Chinese communities have their origins in Guangdong and/or Cantonese culture. In particular, the [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] dialects have proportionately more speakers among overseas Chinese people than Mandarin-speaking Chinese. Additionally, many Taishanese-speaking Chinese [[Chinese emigration|emigrated]] to Western countries, with the results that many Western versions of Chinese words were derived from the Cantonese dialects rather than through the mainstream Mandarin language, such as "[[dim sum]]".   Some Mandarin Chinese words originally of foreign origin also came from the original foreign language by way of Cantonese. For example, the Mandarin word ''{{transl|zh|níngméng}}'' ({{zh|s=柠檬|t=檸檬}}), meaning "Lemon", came from Cantonese, in which the characters are pronounced as ''{{transl|zh|lìng mung}}''.<ref>{{cite book

|accessdate=8 December 2011}}()</ref> In the United States, there is a large number of Chinese who are descendants of immigrants from the [[county-level city]] of [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]] (Toisan in Cantonese), who speak a distinctive dialect related to Cantonese called [[Taishanese]] (or Toishanese).

During the 1850s, the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], whose leader [[Hong Xiuquan]] was born in Guangdong and received a pamphlet from a Protestant Christian missionary in Guangdong, was allied with a local Guangdong [[Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856)]]. Because of direct contact with the West, Guangdong was the center of anti-Manchu and anti-imperialist activity. The generally acknowledged founder of modern China, [[Sun Yat-sen]], was also from Guangdong.

===20th century===
During the early 1920s of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], Guangdong was the staging area for the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) to prepare for the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]], an effort to bring the various [[warlord era|warlords]] of China back under a unified central government. [[Whampoa Military Academy]] was built near Guangzhou to train military commanders.

In recent years, the province has seen extremely rapid economic growth, aided in part by its close trading links with Hong Kong, which borders it. It is now the province with the highest gross domestic product in China.

In 1952, a small section of Guangdong's coastline ([[Qinzhou]],  Lianzhou (now [[Hepu County]]), [[Fangchenggang]] and [[Beihai]]) was given to Guangxi, giving it access to the sea. This was reversed in 1955, and then restored in 1965. [[Hainan]] Island was originally part of Guangdong, but it was separated into its own province in 1988.

== Geography ==
[[File:虎门大桥.JPG|<center>[[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] and [[Humen Pearl River Bridge|Humen Bridge]]</center>|right|thumb]]

Guangdong faces the [[South China Sea]] to the south and has a total of {{convert|4,300|km|abbr=on}} of coastline. The [[Leizhou Peninsula]] is on the southwestern end of the province. There are a few inactive [[volcanoes]] on Leizhou Peninsula. The [[Pearl River Delta]] is the convergent point of three upstream rivers: the [[Dong Jiang|East River]], [[Bei Jiang|North River]], and [[Xi Jiang|West River]]. The [[river delta]] is filled with hundreds of small islands. The province is geographically separated from the north by a few [[mountain range]]s collectively called the [[Nan Mountains]] (Nan Ling). The highest peak in the province is [[Shikengkong]] with an elevation of 6,240 feet (1,902 meters) above sea level.

Guangdong borders [[Fujian]] to the northeast, [[Jiangxi]] and [[Hunan]] to the north, [[Guangxi]] autonomous region to the west, and [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] [[special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|Special Administrative Regions]] to the south. [[Hainan]] is offshore across from the [[Leizhou Peninsula]]. [[Pratas Island]], which were traditionally governed as part of Guangdong, are part of [[Cijin District]], [[Kaoshiung]], [[Taiwan]] (ROC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/joe-hung/2009/06/22/213223/Sovereignty-over.htm |title=Sovereignty over the Spratly Islands – The China Post 22 June 2009 |publisher=Chinapost.com.tw |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924083855/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/joe-hung/2009/06/22/213223/Sovereignty-over.htm |archivedate=24 September 2012  }}</ref>

Cities around the [[Pearl River Delta]] include [[Dongguan]], [[Foshan]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Huizhou]], [[Jiangmen]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Shunde]], [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], [[Zhongshan]] and [[Zhuhai]]. Other cities in the province include [[Chaozhou]], [[Chenghai]], [[Nanhai District|Nanhai]], [[Shantou]], [[Shaoguan]], [[Zhanjiang]], [[Zhaoqing]], [[Yangjiang]] and [[Yunfu]].

Guangdong has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'' inland, ''Cwa'' along the coast), though nearing a tropical climate in the far south. Winters are short, mild, and relatively dry, while summers are long, hot, and very wet. Average daily highs in Guangzhou in January and July are {{convert|18|°C|°F}} and {{convert|33|°C|°F}}, respectively, although the humidity makes it feel much hotter in summer. Frost is rare on the coast but may happen a few days each winter well inland.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Guangdong}}
The economy of Guangdong is large enough to be compared to that of many countries. In 2019, the gross domestic product (GDP) is about $1.6&nbsp;trillion, Guangdong has been the largest province by GDP since 1989 in [[Mainland China]]. Guangdong is responsible for 11 percent of the China' $14.4&nbsp;trillion GDP.<ref name="data2018-2019">GDP-2019 is a preliminary data, and GDP-2018 is a revision based on the 2018 CASEN: {{cite press release | url=http://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=E0102| title=Home - Regional - Quarterly by Province| publisher=China NBS| date=15 April 2020| accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> In 2019, Guangdong's GDP was slightly larger than that of Spain ranking 13th.

After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]] and until the start of the [[Deng Xiaoping]] reforms in 1978, Guangdong was an economic backwater, although a large underground, service-based economy has always existed. Economic development policies encouraged industrial development in the interior provinces which were weakly joined to Guangdong via transportation links. The government policy of economic [[autarky]] made Guangdong's access to the ocean irrelevant.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Deng Xiaoping's open door policy radically changed the economy of the province as it was able to take advantage of its access to the ocean, proximity to Hong Kong, and historical links to [[overseas Chinese]]. In addition, until the 1990s when the [[Tax system in China|Chinese taxation system]] was reformed, the province benefited from the relatively low rate of taxation placed on it by the central government due to its post-Liberation status of being economically backward.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Guangdong's economic boom began with the early 1990s and has since spread to neighboring provinces, and also pulled their populations inward.  The economic growth of Guangdong province owes much to the low-value-added manufacturing which characterized (and in many ways still defines) the province's economy following [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s reforms. Guangdong is not only China's largest exporter of goods, it is the country's largest importer as well.<ref name="thechinaperspective1">{{cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/guangdong-province/ |title=Guangdong Province: Economic News and Statistics for Guangdong's Economy |publisher=Thechinaperspective.com |accessdate=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502105943/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/guangdong-province/ |archivedate=2 May 2012  }}</ref>

Guangdong officially became the [[List of People's Republic of China administrative divisions by population|most populous province]] in 2005.<ref name="English people.com.cn"/><ref name="Chinadaily.com"/> Official statistics had traditionally placed Guangdong as the 4th-most populous province of China with about 80&nbsp;million people, though an influx of migrants, temporary workers, and newly settled individuals numbered around 30&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.163.com/05/0201/11/1BGKCSFN0014183O.html |title=media163 |publisher=media163 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625190924/http://media.163.com/05/0201/11/1BGKCSFN0014183O.html |archivedate=25 June 2012  }}</ref> The massive influx of migrants from other provinces, dubbed the "floating population", is due to Guangdong's booming economy and high demand for labor. If Guangdong were an independent nation, it would rank among the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|twenty largest countries of the world by population]].

===Urbanization===
[[File:Guangzhou skyline.jpg|<center>[[Guangzhou]] is the third largest city in the People's Republic of China</center>|left|thumb]]
Guangdong's population is 70.7% urban and 29.3% rural.<ref name="gd2018"/>

===Genealogy===
Guangdong is the ancestral home of large numbers of [[overseas Chinese]]. Most of the railroad laborers in Canada, Western United States and Panama in the 19th century came from Guangdong. Many people from the region also travelled to the US / California during the gold rush of 1849, and also to Australia during its gold rush a decade or so later.

The majority of the province's population is [[Han Chinese]]. Within the Han Chinese, the largest subgroup in Guangdong are the [[Cantonese people]]. Two other major groups are the [[Teochew people]] in [[Chaoshan]] and the [[Hakka people]] in [[Huizhou]], [[Meizhou]], [[Heyuan]], [[Shaoguan]] and [[Zhanjiang]]. There is a small [[Yao people|Yao]] population in the north. Other smaller [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|minority groups]] include [[She people|She]], [[Hmong people|Miao]], [[Li Chinese|Li]], and [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]].

===Gender ratio===
Guangdong has a highly unbalanced gender ratio that is among the highest of all provinces in China.  According to a 2009 study published in the [[British Medical Journal]], in the 1–4 age group, there are over 130 boys for every 100 girls.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b1211.full |title=China's excess males, sex selective abortion, and one child policy: analysis of data from 2005 national intercensus survey – Zhu et al. 338 |publisher=bmj.com |accessdate=25 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101005559/http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b1211.full |archivedate=1 January 2012  }}</ref>

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Guangdong|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}

Guangdong is governed by a dual-party system like the rest of China. The Governor is in charge of provincial affairs; however, the Communist Party Secretary, often from outside of Guangdong, keeps the Governor in check.

===Relations with Hong Kong and Macau===
[[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], while historically parts of Guangdong before becoming colonies of the United Kingdom and Portugal, respectively, are [[Special administrative region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]] (SARs). Furthermore, the [[Basic Law]]s of both SARs explicitly forbid provincial governments from intervening in local politics. As a result, many issues with Hong Kong and Macau, such as border policy and water rights, have been settled by negotiations between the SARs' governments and the Guangdong provincial government.

== Media ==
Guangdong and the greater Guangzhou area are served by several [[Radio Guangdong]] stations, [[Guangdong Television]], [[Southern Television Guangdong]], [[Shenzhen Television]], and [[Guangzhou Television]]. There is an English programme produced by [[Radio Guangdong]] which broadcasts information about this region to the entire world through the [[WRN Broadcast]].

== Culture ==
{{main|Lingnan culture}}
{{See also|Music of Guangdong}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
The central region, which is also the political and economic center, is populated predominantly by [[Yue Chinese]] speakers, though the influx in the last three decades of millions of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking immigrants has slightly diminished Cantonese linguistic dominance. This region is associated with [[Cantonese cuisine]]. [[Cantonese opera]] is a form of [[Chinese opera]] popular in Cantonese speaking areas. Related Yue dialects are spoken in most of the western half of the province.

The area comprising the cities of [[Chaozhou]], [[Shantou]] and [[Jieyang]] in coastal east Guangdong, known as [[Chaoshan]], forms its own cultural sphere. The [[Teochew people]] here, along with [[Hailufeng dialect|Hailufeng Min]] people in [[Shanwei]], speak [[Hokkien]], which is a [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialect closely related to mainstream [[Hokkien|Southern Min]] (Hokkien) and their cuisine is [[Chiuchow cuisine|Teochew cuisine]]. [[Teochew opera]] is also well-known and has a unique form.

The [[Hakka people]] live in large areas of Guangdong, including [[Huizhou]], [[Meizhou]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Heyuan]], [[Shaoguan]] and other areas. Much of the Eastern part of Guangdong is populated by the Hakka people except for the Chaozhou and Hailufeng area. Hakka culture include [[Hakka cuisine]], Han opera ({{zh|s=汉剧 |t=漢劇}}), Hakka ''Hanyue'' and ''sixian'' (traditional instrumental music) and Hakka folk songs ({{lang|zh|客家山歌}}).

The outcast [[Tanka people]] traditionally live on boats throughout the coasts and rivers of Guangdong and much of Southern China.

[[Zhanjiang]] in southern Guangdong is dominated by the [[Leizhou Min|Leizhou dialect]], a variety of [[Min language|Minnan]]; Cantonese and Hakka are also spoken there.

Mandarin is the language used in education and government and in areas where there are migrants from other provinces, above all in Shenzhen. Cantonese maintains a strong and dominant position in common usage and media, even in eastern areas of the province where the local languages and dialects are non-Yue ones.

Guangdong Province is notable for being the birthplace of many famed [[Xiangqi]] (Chinese chess) grandmasters such as [[Lü Qin]], Yang Guanli, Cai Furu and [[Xu Yinchuan]].

== Education ==
[[Guangdong Province Department of Education]] is the department of the provincial government that oversees education.
