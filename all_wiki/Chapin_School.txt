'''Chapin School''' is an [[single-sex education|all-girls]] independent [[day school]] located in [[New York City]]'s [[Upper East Side]] neighborhood in [[Manhattan]].

== History ==

Maria Bowen Chapin opened "Miss Chapin's School for Girls and Kindergarten for Boys and Girls" in 1901. The school originally enrolled 78 students, who were taught by seven teachers.<ref>[http://www.chapin.edu/experience_chapin/history.html "School History & Timeline"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023213302/http://chapin.edu/experience_chapin/history.html |date=October 23, 2007 }}, undated, at chapin.edu. Retrieved May 18, 2009.</ref> It developed from a small elementary school Chapin and Alice Wetmore founded in 1894 that was explicitly intended to prepare young girls for success at the [[Brearley School]], which had been created 10 years earlier. Chapin ran the educational side of "Primary Classes for Girls" and Wetmore ran the business end. The two ended their partnership in 1901, and Miss Chapin's School was born.

Chapin's first high school diplomas were granted in 1908, and the last boys attended in 1917.

According to archival sources recounted in ''And Cheer for the Green and Gold'', Chapin was an early feminist and suffragette who focused heavily on character development and intended the school to offer the same classical education as was available to boys of that era.

Chapin remained headmistress until 1932. At her request, the school was renamed the Chapin School after she died, in 1934.

Chapin is at 100 [[East End Avenue]], at East [[84th Street (Manhattan)|84th Street]]. Chapin's school was originally at 12 West [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th Street]]. In 1905 the school moved to East [[58th Street (Manhattan)|58th Street]]. In 1910 it moved to East [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]]. The school has been at its current location on the [[Upper East Side]] since 1928.<ref>[http://www.chapin.edu/experience_chapin/history.html "School History & Timeline"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023213302/http://chapin.edu/experience_chapin/history.html |date=October 23, 2007 }}, undated, at chapin.edu.

== Academics, activities, and athletics ==
Chapin's 802 students are split into three divisions: Lower School ([[kindergarten]] through grade 3), [[Middle School]] (grades 4 through 7), and [[Upper School]] (grades 8 through 12).

Around sixty girls start in kindergarten, where they are divided into three classes. Each K class has two teachers, with regular use of teaching specialists (e.g., reading, Spanish, art, music, science, technology, gym, etc.)

There are about 265 students in the Upper School (8th through 12th grades), where they are taught by 53 faculty members. Traditionally, Chapin did not make an effort to replace students who left the school (generally for boarding and coed schools), leading to graduating classes of around 40. In recent years, students are more readily accepted into Chapin's middle and upper schools, leading to graduating classes of around 55.

While the lower school program combines progressive and traditional characteristics, the upper school curriculum is considered to be a traditionally rigorous liberal arts program. There are multiple requirements, including at least one modern language and two years of [[Latin]]. While a small school, Chapin offers 15 [[Advanced Placement]] courses and a total of 36 elective courses in grades 10-12. Elective courses may cover topics such as neuroscience, pharmacology, directing lab or Greek. Upper school students may take up to 2 electives per trimester.

Many students do independent studies or study abroad programs, particularly through Chapin's exchange programs with the St. Hilda's Anglican School for Girls (Perth, Australia) and the [[American Community Schools]] (Athens, Greece). Since 2011, Chapin has worked with the Kibera School for Girls in Nairobi, Kenya, developing curriculum ideas and visiting each other's campuses.<ref name="chapin">{{cite web|url=http://www.chapin.edu/cf_news/view.cfm?newsid=1463|website=chapin.edu|title=News Post|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref> Chapin is also a charter affiliate member of the [[Online School for Girls]] (OSG), in which students can take courses offered to more than 30 girls' schools across the country. [[New York Interschool]] courses are offered in advanced math, leadership, and ethics. Mentorship derives from multiple sources, including faculty advisors and peer leaders.<ref name="chapin2">{{cite web|url=http://www.chapin.edu/page.cfm?p=2674|website=chapin.edu|title=The Chapin School: Quick Facts|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref>

While many Chapin students live on the Upper East Side near the school, others hail from other parts of Manhattan, as well as Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, New Jersey, Westchester, and Long Island.

The student-to-teacher ratio is 6.8 to 1. Twenty-one percent of the students receive tuition assistance, amounting to over $5&nbsp;million per year.<ref name="chapin3">{{cite web|url=http://www.chapin.edu/page.cfm?p=3135|website=chapin.edu|title=The Chapin School: Chapin Facts|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref>

Among the 21 Chapin activities are the [[student government]] (advisory), the [[student newspaper]], the [[literary magazine]], [[Amnesty International]], the [[Gay-Straight Alliance]], the [[Model UN]], and groups dedicated to the study and performance of [[Classics]], [[dance]], [[drama]], [[music]], [[math]], [[media (communication)|media]], the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], and [[science]]. Students are also welcome to start up new clubs during the school year.

There are 18 athletic teams at Chapin, including 15 varsity sports. The Gators compete in the Athletic Association for Independent Schools (AAIS), which is a league composed of the [[Brearley School]], Chapin, [[Friends Seminary]], [[Hewitt School]], [[Marymount School of New York|Marymount School]], [[Nightingale Bamford School]], [[Packer Collegiate Institute]], [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]], [[Saint Ann's School (Brooklyn)|Saint Ann's School]], and [[Spence School]]. Chapin varsity sports include [[badminton]], [[basketball]], [[cross country running|cross country]], [[fencing]], [[field hockey]], [[golf]], [[gymnastics]], [[indoor track]], [[lacrosse]], [[soccer]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]], [[Track and field|track]] and [[volleyball]].<ref name="chapin5">{{cite web|url=http://www.chapin.edu/page.cfm?p=3137|website=chapin.edu|title=The Chapin School: Athletics|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref>

== Traditions ==
[[File:Chapin School 100 E End Av jeh.jpg|thumb|The Chapin School|left]]

The school's [[motto]] is ''Fortiter et Recte'' (Bravely and Rightly).

The wheel on the school's seal was chosen by the school's founder because it is the symbol for [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], the patron saint of philosophers, thinkers, and educated women. The students leave assembly in a wheel pattern.<ref name="chapin6">{{cite web|url=http://www.chapin.edu/page.cfm?p=2607|website=chapin.edu|title=The Chapin School: Mission & History|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref>

Chapin was fond of plants, which led to the school's early construction of a greenhouse within the building. Lower schoolers care for its plants during holidays, and kindergarten applicants are given a Chapin plant during the interview process.

From its beginning, the Chapin School educated students from some of the most affluent and socially prominent families in New York. At the same time, the school has long focused on the importance of serving the surrounding community and on feminism. In 1923, for example, the Alumnae Association created a babies clinic and a health clinic for the disadvantaged. Scholarship funds began to be collected during the Great Depression; proceeds of this fundraising allowed students to continue in school despite the economic turmoil of the 1930s. Seniors (or "Twelves") were offered a course on the status and work of women beginning in the 1940s. Mildred Berendsen was headmistress during the tumultuous 1960s, and she became an early board member of A Better Chance and Early Steps, both of which had just been created to encourage and prepare students of color for private schools. She would later be involved in an even more successful program, [[Prep for Prep]]. The first African-American student enrolled at Chapin in 1967. Within three years, there would be 17 African American girls at the school. Thirty-eight percent of Chapin students in 2016 are young women of color.

The specifics of the school uniform have steadily evolved since 1914. As of 2017, the uniform depends upon the girl's grade level, but green is a recurrent sartorial theme.

Chapin has had a tradition of green/gold competitions since at least 1912. Throughout the year, but especially on the annual Field Day, these green and gold teams fiercely compete until a winner is announced at the end of each school year. Students join their team in 4th grade—when applicable, joining the team of their mother or grandmother—and remain on the same team throughout their time at Chapin.<ref name="chapin2" />

Commencement ceremonies have remained unchanged for a century. Students wear white dresses and stand together with no differentiation made. No academic awards are given, and there has never been a Chapin valedictorian.

Chapin has affiliations and competitions with a variety of other New York City schools, often through [[New York Interschool]]. Chapin is most closely aligned and rivalrous, however, with the neighboring [[Brearley School]], with which it shares some classes, after-school programs, [[homecoming]], and a robotics team.<ref name="robotics">{{cite web|url=http://robotics.brearley.org|website=robotics.brearley.org|title=Double X Robotics – Home|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref>

== Facilities ==
All Chapin programs exist under one roof.

=== Annenberg Library ===
The building features the two-story Annenberg Library with over 45,000 volumes and rooms for [[multimedia]] and [[video editing]].<ref name="chapin7">{{cite web|url=http://www.chapin.edu/page.cfm?p=2685|website=chapin.edu|title=The Chapin School: Library|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref><ref name="chapin8">{{cite web|url=http://www.chapin.edu/page.cfm?p=2669|website=chapin.edu|title=The Chapin School: Curriculum|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref> The library also contains a [[3D printing]] and vinyl cutting room, three student study rooms, a student conference room, multiple lounge and table areas amongst the bookshelves, and a multi-media room. There is also a separate lower-school library.

=== Classrooms and gyms ===
As of 2015, Chapin featured 49 classrooms, eight science laboratories, four art studios including a photography [[darkroom]] and a [[ceramics]] studio, two [[music studios]], a [[black box theater]], a [[dance studio]], two computer laboratories, four gymnasiums and a greenhouse.

=== Additional facilities ===
Chapin students make frequent use of [[Carl Schurz Park]], which is located across the street from the school, as well as Asphalt Green Aquatics Center, which is six blocks away.

In 2008, construction at Chapin provided new facilities for art, language, science and the greenhouse via expansion of the fifth and sixth floors and addition of the seventh and eighth floors.<ref name="advancedglazings">{{cite web|url=http://blog.advancedglazings.com/2011/02/23/chapin/|website=blog.advancedglazings.com|title=Urban School Harnesses Daylight, Architectural Firm Is Born &#124; Solera Light Reading|accessdate=February 14, 2017|date=February 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028232706/https://blog.advancedglazings.com/2011/02/23/chapin/|archive-date=October 28, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
