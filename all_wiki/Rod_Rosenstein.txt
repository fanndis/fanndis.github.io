President [[Donald Trump]] nominated Rosenstein to serve as Deputy Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice on February 1, 2017. Rosenstein was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 25, 2017.

In May 2018, Rosenstein reportedly told the five [[U.S. Attorney]]s in districts along the border with Mexico that, where refugees were concerned, they should not "be categorically declining immigration prosecutions of adults in family units because of the age of a child." The directive, issued as part of the [[Trump administration family separation policy]], led to the separation of thousands of small children from their parents, many of whom were seeking asylum in the United States after fleeing [[Northern Triangle of Central America|violence in Central America]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/us/politics/family-separation-border-immigration-jeff-sessions-rod-rosenstein.html|title='We Need to Take Away Children,' No Matter How Young, Justice Dept.

{{see also|Dismissal of James Comey}}
On May 8, 2017, President Trump directed Sessions and Rosenstein to make a case against FBI Director [[James Comey]] in writing. The next day, Rosenstein handed a memo to Sessions providing the basis for Sessions's recommendation to President Trump that Comey be [[James Comey#Dismissal|dismissed]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39866767|work=BBC News |title=Rod Rosenstein's letter recommending Comey is fired |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510022336/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39866767|archivedate=May 10, 2017 |accessdate=May 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/comey-fbi-memo-rod-rosenstein.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Deputy Attorney General's Memo Spells Out Case Against Comey|first=Charlie |last=Savage|quote=When President Trump fired James B.

''The New York Times'' reported in August 2020 that concerns about a possible counterintelligence threat posed by Trump's personal and financial dealings with Russia increased after his May 9 firing of Comey, prompting the FBI to open an inquiry separate from the [[Crossfire Hurricane (FBI investigation)]] and the incipient [[Mueller investigation]]. Within days, Rosenstein curtailed that inquiry, giving the bureau the impression that Mueller would pursue it, though Rosenstein instructed Mueller not to, effectively ending the inquiry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/us/politics/trump-russia-justice-department.html|title=Justice Dept.

Former FBI deputy director [[Andrew McCabe]] stated in a February 2019 [[60 Minutes]] interview that during the days after Comey was fired, "the highest levels of American law enforcement were trying to figure out what to do with the president," including the possibility of invoking the [[25th Amendment]] to have Trump removed from office. Rosenstein again denied such discussions occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/mccabe-trump.html|title=McCabe Says Justice Officials Discussed Recruiting Cabinet Members to Push Trump Out of Office|first1=Adam|last1=Goldman|first2=Matthew|last2=Haag|date=February 14, 2019|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

===Transfer of Mueller oversight and issuance of report===
On November 7, 2018, Trump named [[Matthew Whitaker]] as Acting Attorney General, and Whitaker took over the oversight of Mueller's investigation. Oversight of the investigation was later assumed by [[William Barr]] upon his confirmation as Attorney General.<ref name=cnbcnov7 /><ref name=voxnov7>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/11/7/17896316/matthew-whitaker-jeff-sessions-trump-mueller|title=Matthew Whitaker said the Mueller probe could become a "witch hunt." He's now in charge of it.|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=theweeknov7 /><ref name=hillnov7 />

On March 22, 2019, Mueller released his report to Attorney General Barr. On March 24, Barr sent a four-page letter to Congressional leaders "summarizing" the Mueller report, although he later said he had not intended the letter as a summary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/31/when-is-summary-not-a-summary/?noredirect=on|title=When is a summary not a summary?|last=Rubin|first=Jennifer|date=March 31, 2019|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref> In it he said that Mueller had made no determination about whether Trump had committed obstruction of justice, and that Barr and Rosenstein had concluded that the evidence in the report was "not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/ag-barrs-letter-on-mueller-report-leaves-many-unanswered-questions.html|title=Attorney General William Barr's letter to Congress on special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report left many unanswered questions|last=Breuninger|first=Kevin|date=March 25, 2019|work=CNBC|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref>

In an address at the [[Yale Club]] as he was preparing to leave the Justice Department following the release of the Mueller Report, Rosenstein criticized the Obama administration, the FBI, Congress, and the press for their conduct regarding [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]]. Rosenstein asserted, “The previous administration chose not to publicize the full story about Russian computer hackers and social media trolls, and how they relate to a broader strategy to undermine America.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/us/politics/trump-obama-russian-meddling.html|title=Trump Tries to Shift Blame to Obama for Not Countering Russian Meddling|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=February 20, 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> He asserted that former FBI director [[James Comey]] had stated that Trump pressured him to end the investigation into the matter. Rosenstein went on to say, "In politics — as in journalism — the rules of evidence do not apply.” He quoted President Trump advocating for the rule of law. He also criticized the FBI and Congress for leaks regarding the investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-speech.html|title=Rosenstein Assails Obama Administration, Comey and Journalists in Defending Handling of Russia Inquiry|first=Katie|last=Benner|date=April 26, 2019|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref>

===Involvement in Trump administration's family separation policy===
In May 2018, Rosenstein reportedly told five [[U.S. Attorney]]s in districts along the border with Mexico that, where refugees were concerned, they should not "be categorically declining immigration prosecutions of adults in family units because of the age of a child." The directive, issued under Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] and other Trump Justice Department officials as part of the [[Trump administration family separation policy]], led to the separation of thousands of small children from their parents, many of whom were seeking asylum in the United States after fleeing [[Northern Triangle of Central America|violence in Central America]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/us/politics/family-separation-border-immigration-jeff-sessions-rod-rosenstein.html|title='We Need to Take Away Children,' No Matter How Young, Justice Dept.
