'''Strathclyde''' ({{lang|gd|Srath Chluaidh}} {{IPA-gd|s̪t̪ɾa ˈxl̪ˠɯi|}} in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], meaning "strath (city) of the [[River Clyde]]") is one of thirty one [[Local government States in Scotland|local government]] 
[[Regions and districts of Scotland|regions]] of [[Scotland]] created in 1974 by the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] and [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994|Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]]. The Strathclyde region had 19 [[Regions and districts of Scotland|districts]]. The region was named after the medieval [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] but covered a broader geographic area than its namesake.

== Functions ==
The area was on the west coast of Scotland and stretched from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] in the north to the [[Southern Uplands]] in the south. As a local government region, its population, in excess of 2.5&nbsp;million, was by far the largest of the regions and contained half  of the nation's total.<ref>[https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usfeatures/areas/strathclyde.html Strathclyde], Undiscovered Scotland</ref> The Region was responsible for education (from nursery to colleges); social work; police; fire; sewage; [[strategic planning]]; roads; transport – and, therefore, employed almost 100,000 public servants (almost half were teachers, lecturers and others in the education service).<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/a-cry-of-gerrymander-as-strathclyde-is-axed-1485561.html A cry of 'Gerrymander' as Strathclyde is axed], The Independent, 18 July 1993</ref><ref>[https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12051786.region-hands-over-reins-after-21-years/ Region hands over reins after 21 years], The Herald, 18 March 1996 </ref>

The regional administrative headquarters was in the city of [[Glasgow]], and politics were by and large dominated by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].  The first regional council convener was the Reverend [[Geoff Shaw (minister)|Geoff Shaw]], who died in 1978. It was largely due to his leadership that the Region forged its innovative strategy on [[Multiple deprivation index|multiple deprivation]], which remained its central commitment to the end of the Region's life through "Social Strategy for the Eighties" (1982) and "SS for the 90s".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicadminreform.webs.com/|title=key papers|website=publicadminreform}}</ref>

== Police ==
Until April 2013, the area was also used as a police force area, covered by [[Strathclyde Police]] and a [[Fire services in Scotland|fire service]] area, covered by [[Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service]]. Both have now been replaced by single services ([[Police Scotland]] and [[Scottish Fire and Rescue Service]]).

== Transport ==
The name is still in use as a transport area, covered by [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport]]. The area covered by SPT however is smaller than the region, as most of [[Argyll and Bute]] lies outside its remit.

== Boundaries ==
The region was formed from the [[Counties of Scotland|county]] of the [[City of Glasgow]], the counties of [[Ayr (county)|Ayr]], [[Bute (county)|Bute]], [[Dunbarton (county)|Dunbarton]], [[Lanark (county)|Lanark]], and [[Renfrew (county)|Renfrew]], and parts of the counties of [[Argyll (county)|Argyll]] (all ''except the district of [[Ardnamurchan]] and the electoral divisions of [[Ballachulish]] and [[Kinlochleven]]''), and the county of [[Stirling (county)|Stirling]] (the burgh of [[Kilsyth]], Western No. 3 district, the electoral division of Kilsyth West, and the polling district of Kilsyth East (Banton)).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1973/oct/22/new-local-government-areas|title=New Local Government areas|publisher=[[Hansard]]|date=22 October 1973 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSFG|title= Modern Times: 1950s to The Present Day > Neighbourhoods|author=Irene Maver|website=The Glasgow Story|accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/glasgow/|title=Scotland's Landscape: City of Glasgow|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref>


Since 1996 the area of the region has been divided between 12 [[Council areas of Scotland|council areas]]: [[Argyll and Bute (council area)|Argyll and Bute]], [[East Ayrshire (council area)|East Ayrshire]], [[East Dunbartonshire (council area)|East Dunbartonshire]], [[East Renfrewshire (council area)|East Renfrewshire]], [[Glasgow City (council area)|Glasgow City]] (created as ''[[City of Glasgow (council area)|City of Glasgow]]''), [[Inverclyde (council area)|Inverclyde]], [[North Ayrshire (council area)|North Ayrshire]], [[North Lanarkshire (council area)|North Lanarkshire]], [[Renfrewshire (council area)|Renfrewshire]], [[South Ayrshire (council area)|South Ayrshire]], [[South Lanarkshire (council area)|South Lanarkshire]], and [[West Dunbartonshire (council area)|West Dunbartonshire]] (created as ''[[Dumbarton and Clydebank (council area)|Dumbarton and Clydebank]]''), all created to be entirely within the area of the region.

=== Sub-regions and districts ===

Except for [[Argyll and Bute (local government district, Strathclyde region)|Argyll and Bute]] and the [[Glasgow (district)|City of Glasgow]], the 19 districts were grouped to form 'sub-regions' or 'divisions', each named after a historic county. The Argyll and Bute district and the City of Glasgow district were sub-regions in their own right, and Argyll and Bute was named after two counties.
