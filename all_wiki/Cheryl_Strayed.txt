== Early life ==
Strayed was born in [[Spangler, Pennsylvania]], the second daughter of Barbara Anne "Bobbi" (née Young; 1945–1991) and Ronald Nyland. At age six, she moved with her family from Pennsylvania to [[Chaska, Minnesota]]. Her parents divorced soon after and Cheryl's father left her life. When Cheryl was 12 her mother married Glenn Lambrecht, and the following year the family moved to rural [[Aitkin County, Minnesota|Aitkin County]], where they lived in a house that they had built themselves on 40 acres. The house did not have electricity or running water for the first few years. Indoor plumbing was installed after Strayed moved away for college. Strayed also has two half-siblings from her father's second marriage, with whom she connected only after ‘Wild’ was published.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2013/09/08/cheryl-strayed-wild-half-sister/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/09/08/219754257/the-wild-story-of-cheryl-strayed-and-her-long-lost-half-sister}}</ref>

In 1986, at the age of 17, Strayed graduated from [[McGregor High School]] in [[McGregor, Minnesota]], where she was a track and cross country runner, cheerleader, and homecoming queen. In 1987, during the summer after her freshman year of college, Strayed worked as a newspaper reporter for her hometown county weekly, The Aitkin Independent Age in [[Aitkin, Minnesota]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.messagemedia.co/aitkin/}}</ref>
She loosely based the fictional Coltrap County in her novel ''Torch'' on McGregor and Aitkin County. Strayed attended her freshman year of college at the [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], but by her sophomore year, she transferred to the [[University of Minnesota]] in Minneapolis, where she received her Bachelor of Arts degree, graduating [[magna cum laude]] with a double major in English and [[Women's Studies]]. In March 1991, when Strayed was a senior in college, her mother, Bobbi Lambrecht, died suddenly of lung cancer at the age of 45. Strayed has described this loss as her "genesis story". She has written about her mother's death and her grief in each of her books and several of her essays.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kirch, Clare |title=Girl gone wild: Cheryl Strayed |date=January 9, 2012 |work=Publishers Weekly |issue=2 |volume=259}}</ref>
