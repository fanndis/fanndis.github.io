Due to its location just south of the City of Manila, Pasay quickly became an urban town during the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American colonial period]].

==History==
=== Early history ===
{{see also|Namayan|Rajahnate of Maynila}}
[[File:Map of the Kingdom of Namayan.jpg|left|thumb|120px|The map of territory once said to be under the rule of [[Namayan]], which includes Pasay, in modern [[Metro Manila]]]]

In local folk history about the period before the arrival of Spanish colonizers, Pasay is said to have been part of [[Namayan]] (sometimes also called Sapa), a [[confederation]] of [[Barangay state|barangay]]s which supposedly controlled territory stretching from [[Manila Bay]] to [[Laguna de Bay]], and which, upon the arrival of the Spanish, eventually became known as Santa Ana de Sapa (modern day [[Santa Ana, Manila]]).<ref name="Dery2001">{{cite book  | last = Dery  | first = Luis Camara  | authorlink =   | title = A History of the Inarticulate  | publisher = New Day Publishers  | date = 2001  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 978-971-10-1069-0  }}</ref> According to these legends, the ruler of Namayan bequeathed his territories in what is now Culi-culi, Pasay, and [[Baclaran]] to one of his sons, named Pasay, explaining the origin of the name.<ref name="Dery2001"/>

In another version of the legend, it was [[Rajah Sulayman]] of [[Rajahnate of Maynila|Maynila]] who bequeathed the territory to his child - also named Pasay, but this time a daughter with the title of ''Dayang-dayang''.<ref name="Dery2001"/>

===Spanish era===
On May 19, 1571, [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] took formal possession of the [[Rajahnate of Maynila]] and its surrounding polities in the name of the Spanish crown{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}.

Of the many religious orders that came, it was the [[Augustinian Order]] who would figure predominantly in the evangelisation of Pasay. The parish of Pasay was governed from the old Namayan capital, since renamed Santa Ana de Sapa, which was under the jurisdiction of the [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]]. The promise of space in [[Heaven]] prompted early native converts to donate their possessions to the Church, with folklore recounting how a baptized Pasay on her deathbed donated her vast estate to the Augustinians. Most of Pasay went to friar's hands either via donation or by purchase; many natives were also forced to divest of their properties to cope with stringent colonial impositions. In 1727, the Augustinians formally took over Pasay and attached it to the [[Malate Church|Parish of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios]] in [[Malate, Manila|Malate]]. In that year, Pasay was renamed ''"Pineda"'' in honour of ''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'' Cornelio Pineda, a Spanish [[horticulturist]].

In 1862, a number of prominent citizens of Pasay sent a petition to the civil and ecclesiastical authorities asking that they be allowed to manage their own political and religious affairs. On December 2, 1863, Pasay became a ''pueblo'' upon the recommendation of the [[Archbishop of Manila]], Gregorio Melitón Martínez Santa Cruz.

===Revolution and the Spanish–American War===
Pasay produced numerous heroes during the [[Philippine Revolution]]. The [[Katipunan]], the organization founded by [[Andrés Bonifacio]] that spearheaded the revolution, had a chapter in Pineda organized by Pascual Villanueva, Jacinto Ignacio, and Valentin Ignacio. Several women also fought for the cause of the [[Katipunan]] including [[Marcela Marcelo]]. The execution of [[José Rizal]], who authored the novels ''[[Noli me tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' (considered seditious by the colonial government) on December 30, 1896, fanned the flames of the Revolution.

General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] meanwhile declared the independence of the [[First Philippine Republic]] on June 12, 1898, and issued decrees providing political reorganization in the country. With this, ''Don'' Catalino became Pasay's first ''Presidente municipal'' (equivalent to today's Mayor).

Pineda was made the command outpost of the ''Primera Zona de Manila'' under Gen. Mariano Noriel, but Gen. Merritt appealed that the Pineda outpost turned over to the Americans so that they could be closer to the Spanish lines. Thinking Americans were allies, Noriel left Pineda on July 29, allowing American General Greene to transfer. When Intramuros was finally captured, the Filipinos were denied entry to the walled city. Since then, tension simmered between Filipino and American troops, with both sides assigned respective zones but neither observed boundary lines. On the night of February 4, 1899, four Filipinos crossed the American line in [[Santa Mesa, Manila]], and shots were exchanged, triggering the [[Philippine–American War]].

On May 19, 1899, General Noriel was given command again of Pineda. In June, Noriel together with General Ricarte almost defeated the American forces had they exploited the exhaustion of the enemy in the Battle of Las Piñas. Instead, their forces were attacked by American reinforcements and bombarded by warships. The assault forced them to abandon Pineda to occupation by American forces.

===American period===
On June 1, 1901, Pineda was incorporated into the [[Rizal|Province of Rizal]]. Antonio Dancel was appointed a provincial governor and Pascual Villanueva as municipal president. On August 4, 1901, a resolution was passed petitioning that the original name of Pasay be returned. On September 6, 1901, the Philippine Commission, acting on the request of the townsfolk, passed Act No. 227 renaming Pineda back to Pasay.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l8b8a| title = Act No. 227 | accessdate = December 2, 2017| publisher = Lawyerly.ph}}</ref> Two years later, on October 12, 1903, Act No. 942 merged Pasay with the southern municipality of Malibay, expanding its territory.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad| title = Act No. 942 | accessdate = December 2, 2017| publisher = Lawyerly.ph}}</ref> With a population of 8,100 in 1903, Pasay was placed under the fourth-class category together with 9 other municipalities.

Friar lands, then nationalized, were turned into subdivisions. Soon the Pasay Real Estate Company offered friar lands as residential lots for sale or for lease to foreign investors. Postal, telegraph, and telephone lines were installed and branches of Philippine Savings Bank were established. In 1907 a first-class road from Pasay to Camp Nichols was completed. Others were repaired including the old Avenida Mexico now called the Taft Avenue extension. Transportation services improved. Among the first buses plying routes to Pasay were Pasay Transportation, Raymundo Transportation, Try-tran, and Halili Transit.

[[File:Fabian de la Rosa, Pasay Beach, Manila.jpg|thumb|left|''Pasay beach, Manila'', oil on board by [[Fabián de la Rosa]], 1927]]
By 1908, [[Meralco]] [[tranvia]] (electric [[tram]] car) lines linked Pasay to Intramuros, Escolta, San Miguel, San Sebastian, and San Juan. Automobiles took to the streets, testing their maximum 20&nbsp;km/h speed on Taft Avenue. On April 11, 1914, Ms. Cora Wong, a nurse at the Chinese General Hospital, became the first woman in the Philippines to fly as a passenger on a flight with [[Tom Gunn]] in a Curtiss seaplane off Pasay Beach.

Much of the bayside area beyond Luneta was swamp but American ex-soldiers were quick to seize the opportunity to develop it for residential purposes. By 1918, Pasay had a population of 18,697 because of the exodus of prominent Filipino families and government officials to this seaside town including future president Manuel L. Quezon. By the 1930s, the former rural town had become a suburb of the capital city.

=== Japanese occupation and the Second Republic ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}

World War II came and on December 26, 1941, McArthur issued a proclamation declaring Manila and its suburbs (Caloocan, Quezon City, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Pasay) an open city. On New Year's Day 1942, Quezon, while in Corregidor, called his secretary Jorge Vargas and appointed him by executive order "the Mayor of Greater Manila" which included Pasay. The mayor of Pasay was then Rufino Mateo, governing a town of more than 55,161. During the WWII many Pasayeños joined in the fight against the Japanese. Jose P. Maibag, born and bred in Pasay, laid out underground networking. Carlos Mendoza, a resident of Barrio San Roque, together with 14 others, formed a mobile broadcasting station called "The Voice of Juan dela Cruz." On July 11, 1942, Japanese military police captured the group. Carling Mendoza, alias Juan de la Cruz" and other members of the group were brought to the old Bilibid Prison and were tortured.

Pasay had to redo the signs all over town, with Filipino was ordered to prevail over English. The national language became a core subject in the secondary school curriculum, while Japanese was taught as well at all levels of education. On October 14, 1943, Japan proclaimed the Second Philippine Republic. Meantime, food had become so scarce that prices soared. Pasay residents began to move away from the city to the provinces outside. In the middle of February up to early March 1945, as the combined Allied forces began to converge on the way to the Manila area northwards from the south, Pasay suffered enormous damage during the month-long [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], and many residents perished either by the Japanese or friendly fire from the combined Filipino and American forces.

===Third Republic and the conversion to city status===
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2019}}

On February 27, 1945, General MacArthur turned over the government to President Sergio Osmeña. One of Osmeña's first acts was to dissolve the Greater Manila Complex. [[Caloocan]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Makati]], Pasay, and [[Parañaque|Paranaque]] were returned to their original province of Rizal. He then appointed Juan S. Salcedo, born in Pasay in 1904, as Director of Philippine Health, and then as executive officer of the Philippine Rehabilitation Administration in charge of national recovery from the devastation wrought by the Japanese occupation. Osmeña appointed Adolfo Santos as prewar vice mayor of Pasay, in place of incumbent Moises San Juan who died during the war.

Ignacio Santos Diaz, a congressman from the first district of Pasay, pushed for the conversion of the town into a city and it to be named after Rizal. Republic Act No. 183 was signed into law by President Roxas on June 21, 1947, officially establishing '''Rizal City''',<ref name="RA183">{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 183 - An Act Creating The Rizal City |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno183.html |website=www.chanrobles.com |publisher=Philippine Laws, Statutes And Codes - Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |accessdate=3 April 2018 |language=en |date=June 21, 1947}}</ref> with Mateo Rufino as Mayor and a population of 88,738. As of June 1948, the city had revenues of P472,835. But the residents could not get themselves to call their city by its new name. After two years, eight months, and twelve days of trying, the force of habit prevailed and Pasay Congressman Eulogio Rodriguez, Jr. filed a bill returning the city to its original name. On May 3, 1950, President [[Elpidio Quirino]], once a resident of Pasay himself, signed into law Republic Act No. 437, which changed the name of Rizal City to '''Pasay City'''.<ref name="RA437">{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 437 - An Act Changing the Name of Rizal City to Pasay City |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno437.html |website=www.chanrobles.com |publisher=Philippine Laws, Statutes And Codes - Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |accessdate=3 April 2018 |language=en |date=June 7, 1950}}</ref>

It was also in the 1940s when houses of faith were constructed in different parts of Pasay. Among them was the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows, the Libreria de San Pablo Catholic Women's League, Caritas, the nutrition center, and the grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes. In 1951, two parishes were established: the Parish of San Isidro Labrador and the Parish of San Rafael. By that time the city was once more the aviation center of the country when what is now the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] opened its doors in 1948.

On June 14, 1955, Pasay City regained its power to choose its leader. [[Pablo Cuneta]] ran against one-time Mayor Adolfo Santos and became the city's first elected mayor. In 1959, he campaigned again and won against his former vice mayor, Ruperto Galvez. On December 30, 1965, Ferdinand Marcos was sworn in as President of the Philippines, with [[Fernando Lopez]], a resident of Pasay, as vice-president. From that moment [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda Romualdez Marcos]], the then First Lady, became involved in national affairs. On the northern boundary of Pasay, she started filling the waterfront on Manila Bay to build the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]. In the later decades she would add three more architectural showpieces on reclaimed land in Pasay: the Folk Arts Theater, Film Center, and the [[Philippine International Convention Center]], and later on the PhilCite Exhibition Hall, the basis of what is now today the nation's first ever true amusement park, [[Star City (amusement park)|Star City]]. The city, through, was also being groomed as a television center for the country, for in 1958 [[ABS-CBN]] had opened its brand new television studios on what is now [[Roxas Boulevard]] with state of the art equipment, the studios, with color-ready equipment and cameras from Japan plus a number of video recording equipment, were handed over in 1969 to the [[Radio Philippines Network]], which used them until a 1973 fire which ruined the studios, as ABS-CBN had moved northward into Quezon City with the opening of its current studios and offices.

In 1967, Jovito Claudio won the city elections as chief executive against Pablo Cuneta. In the following year, an [[Pope Paul VI#Attempted assassination of Paul VI|assassination attempt]] occurred in Pasay when a Bolivian surrealist painter lunged at [[Pope Paul VI]], with a knife grazing his chest. In 1971, Cuneta was re-elected as city mayor of a growing city of almost 90 thousand people.

On December 7, 1972, almost two months after martial law was declared, an assassin tried to kill Imelda Marcos. The event took place in Pasay, on live television, while Mrs. Marcos was distributing prizes to the winners of the National Beautification and Cleanliness contest. She suffered some wounds and broken nails but on the whole, she emerged unscathed from that close encounter. On the second anniversary of martial law, Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 557, declaring every barrio in the country as barangays.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree No. 557 - Declaring All Barrios in The Philippines as Barangays, and For Other Purposes |url=https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1974/pd_557_1974.html |website=The LawPhil Project |publisher=Arellano Law Foundation |accessdate=6 January 2020 |date=21 September 1974}}</ref> Not long after the decree had been put into effect, the Metropolitan Manila Commission and the Department of Local Government instructed Pasay to create its own barangays. Mayor Cuneta, in response, ordered the creation of 487 barangays. Upon the firm suggestion of Secretary Jose Roño of the Department of Local Government, the number of barangays was cut down to two hundred, organized into several zones.

On November 7, 1975, Marcos appointed the First Lady, Imelda, as governor of Metro Manila. The federation consolidated 13 towns and 4 cities including Pasay, which was removed from Rizal Province.<ref name="PD824">{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html|title=Presidential Decree No. 824 November 7, 1975.

Pasay was the host city of [[Miss Universe 1974]], the first time this event had been held in the morning and in the Asia Pacific, and thus was in the international spotlight in the leadup to the pageant day.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Requintina|first1=Robert|title=PH eyes MOA or Philippine Arena as venue for Miss Universe 2016|url=http://tempo.com.ph/2016/08/02/ph-eyes-moa-or-philippine-arena-as-venue-for-miss-universe-2016/|newspaper=Tempo|accessdate=2 August 2016|language=English, Filipino|date=2 August 2016}}</ref> Half a decade later, the city's first family would become famous nationally in the music scene: Sharon, the then young daughter of the mayor, broke out into the spotlight as a singer with the release of the LP ''DJ's Pet''.

On December 22, 1979, along with [[Manila]], [[Quezon City]], [[Caloocan]], and other cities in the country, Pasay became a highly urbanized city.

===People Power and contemporary period===
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2019}}

The situation changed in the city in the immediate aftermath of the People Power Revolution. Cuneta left his post to be replaced by two acting mayors,  Eduardo Calixto and Norman Urbina, only to be reelected in 1988 and serving for three more terms, before handing over to Jovito O. Claudio in 1998. Upon the end of his term, he was the city's longest ever city mayor. Claudio, himself replaced by the then vice mayor Wenceslao "Peewee" Trinidad in 2000, saw the building of the [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3]] southern terminus in the city, linked to the LRT Line 1 along Taf Avenue, and the Pasay City General Hospital and [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|NAIA Terminal 2]] were both opened to the public. All these and other projects spurred a new era of growth in the city that continues to this day. The EDSA Entertainment Complex, located just to the city's west along [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]], just miles from the [[Baclaran, Parañaque|Baclaran district of Paranaque]], for many years now is very well known for adult entertainment, including [[prostitution]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coorlim |first1=Leif |title=Undercover journalists trawl Manila's seedy red light district |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/06/world/asia/freedom-fighters-undercover/index.html |website=CNN |accessdate=31 January 2019 |date=16 May 2013}}</ref><ref name="A Farang Abroad">{{cite web |title=Starter Guide To Manila Red Light District |url=https://afarangabroad.com/manila-red-light-district/ |website=A Farang Abroad |accessdate=31 January 2019}}</ref>

In 2006, the [[SM Mall of Asia]], the 4th biggest shopping center overall in the country, was opened, and the area around this mall began to grow into the city's business center in the years that followed, followed on by the opening later on of the city's biggest sports venue, the Mall of Asia Arena. 2 years later, the NAIA Terminal 3 opened its doors in July 2008, and within two years, progress blossomed in the vicinity with the opening of yet another residential and entertainment hub, Newport City, strengthened by the construction of the NAIA Expressway in 2016.

In 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].
