James Ladson was born in 1753 in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] to a prominent South Carolinian family of English origin. He was the son of William Ladson and Anne Gibbes. His great-grandfather John Ladson emigrated from [[Northamptonshire]] in England to [[Barbados]] and then to Carolina as one of the first English settlers in 1679, where he built a large plantation and served in the Commons House of Assembly from 1685.<ref>Mary Preston Foster, ''Charleston: A Historic Walking Tour'', p. 31</ref> His mother was the daughter of the prominent colonial official Colonel [[John Gibbes (Carolina)|John Gibbes]] (1696–1764) and the granddaughter of the colonial governor [[Robert Gibbes]]. The [[Gibbes Museum of Art]] is named for his mother's family. James Ladson was also a 2nd great-grandson of [[Henry Woodward (colonist)|Henry Woodward]], the first British colonist in Carolina.<ref name="bio" />

Following the early death of his parents he was raised by his uncle John Gibbes (1733–1780), who owned the Grove Plantation that included today's [[Hampton Park (Charleston)|Hampton Park]] and its surrounding neighbourhoods. He attended the best schools in South Carolina. In 1773 he traveled to England to pursue his education, returning to South Carolina the following year. He owned a plantation in St Andrew Parish and a plantation named Fawn Hill on the Santeee River, and a house and other properties in Charleston.<ref name="bio">''Biographical directory of the South Carolina Senate, 1776–1985'', vol. 2, p. 881, University of South Carolina Press, 1986, {{ISBN|9780872494800}}</ref><ref>Bryan Riggs, ''Historic Homes of Charleston'', 1993</ref>
