'''''The Sun''''' is a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper. As a [[broadsheet]], it was founded in 1964 as a successor to the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', and became a tabloid in 1969 after it was purchased by its current owner.<ref>{{cite news |title=On this day: 1964 The Sun Newspaper is Born |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/15/newsid_3068000/3068749.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=7 June 2017}}</ref> It is published by the [[News UK#News Group Newspapers Ltd|News Group Newspapers]] division of [[News UK]], itself a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corp (company)|News Corp]].<ref name=circ>{{cite web|title=The Sun – readership data|url= http://www.newsworks.org.uk/The-Sun|publisher=News Works|accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nmauk.co.uk/nma/do/live/factsAndFigures?newspaperID=20|title=''The Times'' Facts and figures|publisher=Newspaper Marketing Agency|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205094216/http://www.nmauk.co.uk/nma/do/live/factsAndFigures?newspaperID=20|archivedate=5 February 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since ''The Sun on Sunday'' was launched in February 2012, the paper has been a seven-day operation.

== History ==
=== ''The Sun'' before Rupert Murdoch ===
''The Sun'' was first published as a [[broadsheet]] on 15 September 1964,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/15/newsid_3068000/3068749.stm |title=The Sun newspaper is born |work=BBC News  |date=15 September 2008|accessdate=19 January 2009}}</ref> with a logo featuring a glowing orange disc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenmarkeson.com/scrapbook/large/oldsunlogo.htm|title=Scrapbook – The IPC Sun logo|website=www.stephenmarkeson.com}}</ref> It was launched by owners [[IPC Media|IPC]] (International Publishing Corporation) to replace the failing ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' on the advice of market researcher [[Mark Abrams]]. The paper was intended to add a readership of "social radicals" to the ''Herald''{{'s}} "political radicals".<ref name="Curran">James Curran and [[Jean Seaton]] ''[[Power Without Responsibility: the Press, Broadcasting and the Internet in Britain]]'', Abingdon: Routledge, 2010, pp. 84–85</ref> Supposedly there was "an immense, sophisticated and superior middle class, hitherto undetected and yearning for its own newspaper", wrote [[Bernard Shrimsley]] of Abrams'   work 40 years later. "As delusions go, this was in the El Dorado class".<ref name="Shrimsley2004">{{cite news|last=Shrimsley|first=Bernard|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/media/article2177525.ece|title=When The Sun failed to shine for the middle class|work=The Times|location=London|date=10 September 2004|accessdate=11 June 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Launched with an advertising budget of £400,000,<ref name="Sandbrook58">Sandbrooik, p.58</ref> the brash new paper "burst forth with tremendous energy", according to ''[[The Times]]''.<ref name="The Times 1964, pp. 10-11">''The Times'', 15 September 1964, pp. 10–11</ref> Its initial print run of 3.5&nbsp;million was attributed to "curiosity" and the "advantage of novelty",<ref name="The Times 1964, pp. 10-11"/> and had declined to the previous circulation of the ''Daily Herald'' (1.2&nbsp;million)<ref name="Curran"/> within a few weeks.

By 1969, according to [[Hugh Cudlipp]], ''The Sun'' was losing about £2m a year<ref name="Grundy">Bill Grundy [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/26th-july-1969/11/the-press "The Press: Of the Sun..."], ''The Spectator'', 25 July 1969, p.11</ref> and had a circulation of 800,000.<ref name="Sandbrook58"/> IPC decided to sell to stop the losses, according to Bernard Shrimsley in 2004, out of a fear that the unions would disrupt publication of the ''Mirror'' if they did not continue to publish the original ''Sun''.<ref name="Shrimsley2004"/> [[Bill Grundy]] wrote in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in July 1969 that although it published "fine writers" in [[Geoffrey Goodman]], [[Nancy Banks-Smith]] and [[John Akass]] among others, it had never overcome the negative impact of its launch at which it still resembled the ''Herald''.<ref name="Grundy"/> The pre-Murdoch ''Sun'' was "a worthy, boring, leftish, popular broadsheet" in the opinion of Patrick Brogan in 1982.<ref name="Brogan">{{cite news|last=Brogan|first=Patrick|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/92429/rupert-murdoch-international-newspaper-empire|title=Citizen Murdoch|work=New Republic|date=11 November 1982|accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref>

Book publisher and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] [[Robert Maxwell]], eager to buy a British newspaper, offered to take it off their hands and retain its commitment to the Labour Party, but admitted there would be redundancies, especially among the printers. [[Rupert Murdoch]], meanwhile, had bought the ''[[News of the World]]'', a [[sensationalist]] Sunday newspaper, the previous year, but the presses in the basement of his building in London's [[Bouverie Street]] were unused six days a week.<ref name="Stokes">Charles Stokes [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/aug/27/rupert-murdoch-the-sun "Rupert Murdoch aims for The Sun"], ''The Guardian'', 27 August 1969 (2013 reprint)</ref>

Seizing the opportunity to increase his presence on Fleet Street, he made an agreement with the print unions,<ref name="Stokes"/> promising fewer redundancies if he acquired the newspaper. He assured IPC that he would publish a "straightforward, honest newspaper" which would continue to support Labour. IPC, under pressure from the unions, rejected Maxwell's offer, and Murdoch bought the paper for £800,000, to be paid in instalments.<ref name="Greenslade, Ch. 9">Greenslade, Ch. 9</ref> He would later remark: "I am constantly amazed at the ease with which I entered British newspapers".<ref name=ChippindaleCh1>{{cite book | last1 = Chippindale | first1 = Peter | last2 = Horrie | first2 = Chris | title = Stick it up your punter! : the uncut story of the Sun newspaper (Chapter 1) | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780671017828 }}</ref>

The ''Daily Herald'' had been printed in Manchester since 1930, as was the ''Sun'' after its original launch in 1964, but Murdoch stopped publication there in 1969 which put the ageing Bouverie Street presses under extreme pressure as circulation grew.

=== Early Murdoch years ===
Murdoch found he had such a rapport with [[Larry Lamb (newspaper editor)|Larry Lamb]] over lunch that other potential recruits as editor were not interviewed and Lamb was appointed as the first editor of the new ''Sun''.<ref name="Telegraph2000">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1366801/Sir-Larry-Lamb.html|title=Sir Larry Lamb (obituary)|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=20 May 2000}}</ref> Lamb wanted Bernard Shrimsley to be his deputy, which Murdoch accepted as Shrimsley had been the second name on his list of preferences.<ref name="Times2016">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/register/bernard-shrimsley-06kfj2m37|title=Bernard Shrimsley|work=The Times|location=London|date=11 June 2016|accessdate=11 June 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Lamb was scathing in his opinion of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', where he had recently been employed as a senior sub-editor, and shared Murdoch's view that a paper's quality was best measured by its sales, and he regarded the ''Mirror'' as overstaffed, and too focused on an ageing readership.<ref name="ChippindaleCh1"/> Godfrey Hodgson of ''The Sunday Times'' interviewed Murdoch at this time and expressed a positive view of the rival's "Mirrorscope" supplement. "If you think we're going to have any of that upmarket shit in our paper," Murdoch replied dropping a sample copy into a bin, "you're very much mistaken".<ref name="Brogan"/>

Lamb hastily recruited a staff of about 125 reporters, who were mostly selected for availability rather than their ability.<ref name="ChippindaleCh1" /> This was about a quarter of what the ''Mirror'' then employed, and Murdoch had to draft in staff on loan from his Australian papers. Murdoch immediately relaunched ''The Sun'' as a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], and ran it as a sister paper to the ''News of the World''.<ref name="ChippindaleCh1" /> ''The Sun'' used the same printing presses, and the two papers were managed together at senior executive levels.

The [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''Sun'' was first published on 17 November 1969, with a front page headlined "HORSE DOPE SENSATION", an ephemeral "exclusive".<ref>Roy Greenslade [https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/nov/15/mondaymediasection.comment1 "Night the Sun came up"], ''The Guardian'', 15 November 1999; Grenslade [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KPR0pB9UCS4C&pg=PA218 ''Press Gang''], p.218</ref> An editorial on page 2 announced: "Today's ''Sun'' is a new newspaper. It has a new shape, new writers, new ideas. But it inherits all that is best from the great traditions of its predecessors. ''The Sun'' cares. About the quality of life. About the kind of world we live in. And about people". The first issue had an "exclusive interview" with the Labour Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson]], on page 9.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/article/1969-11-17/3/8.html|title=Murdoch's new ''Sun'' rises|work=The Times|location=London|date=17 November 1969|accessdate=11 June 2016|page=3}} {{subscription required}}</ref> The paper copied the rival ''Daily Mirror'' in several ways. It was the same size and its masthead had the title in white on a red rectangle of the same colour as the ''Daily Mirror''. The ''Mirror''{{'s}} "Live Letters" was matched by "Livelier Letters".<ref>Bruce Page ''The Murdoch Archipelago'', London: Simon & Schuster, 2003, p.142</ref>

Sex was used as an important element in the content and marketing the paper from the start, which Lamb believed was the most important part of his readers' lives.<ref name="Telegraph2000"/><ref>Chippindale & Horrie, p.30</ref> The first topless [[Page 3]] model appeared on 17 November 1970, [[Stephanie Marrian|Stephanie Rahn]]; she was tagged as a "Birthday Suit Girl" to mark the first anniversary of the relaunched ''Sun''.<ref name=C&H>{{cite book | last1 = Chippindale | first1 = Peter | last2 = Horrie | first2 = Chris | title = Stick it up your punter! : the uncut story of the Sun newspaper | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = London | year = 1999 | page= 28 | isbn = 9780671017828 }}</ref> A topless Page 3 model gradually became a regular fixture, and with increasingly risqué poses. Both feminists and many cultural conservatives saw the pictures as pornographic and misogynistic. Lamb later expressed some regret at introducing the feature, although he denied it was sexist.<ref name="Telegraph2000"/> A Conservative council in Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, was the first to ban the paper from its public library, shortly after Page 3 began, because of its excessive sexual content.<ref name="C&H47">Chippindale and Horrie, p,.47-8</ref> Shrimsley, Lamb's deputy, came up with the headline, "The Silly Burghers of Sowerby Bridge" to describe the councillors.<ref name="Times2016"/> The decision was reversed after a sustained campaign by the newspaper itself lasting 16 months, and the election of a Labour-led council in 1971.<ref name="C&H47"/><ref name="HorrieBBC">Chris Horrie [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1026989.stm "Flirty not dirty at 30"], BBC News (London), 17 November 2000</ref>

The Labour MP [[Alex Lyon (politician)|Alex Lyon]] waved a copy of ''The Sun'' in the House of Commons and suggested the paper could be prosecuted for indecency. Sexually related features such as "Do Men Still Want To Marry A Virgin?" and "The Way into a Woman's Bed" began to appear. Serialisations of erotic books were frequent; the publication of extracts from ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'', at a time when copies of the book were being seized by Customs, produced a scandal and a significant amount of free publicity.<ref name="C&H32">Chippindale and Horrie, pp.32–3</ref>

Politically, ''The Sun'' in the early Murdoch years remained nominally Labour-supporting. It advocated a vote for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Harold Wilson]] in the 1970 General Election,<ref name="Thomas">{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = James | title = Popular newspapers, the Labour Party and British politics | publisher = Abingdon (UK): Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2005 | pages = 72–73 | isbn = 9780714653372 }}</ref> with the headline "Why It Must Be Labour",<ref>''The Sun'', 17 June 1970, cited by Roy Greenslade ''Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Money From Propaganda'', London: Pan Macmillan, 2003 [2004], p.235</ref> but by February 1974 it was calling for a vote for the Conservative Party led by [[Edward Heath]] while suggesting that it might support a Labour Party led by [[James Callaghan]] or [[Roy Jenkins]].<ref name="Thomas"/> In the October election an editorial asserted: "ALL our instincts are left rather than right and we would vote for any able politician who would describe himself as a Social Democrat."<ref name="Thomas"/> In the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]] on Britain continuing membership of the [[European Economic Community]], it advocated a vote to stay in the Common Market.<ref name=":1">{{cite news|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jun/14/the-suns-brexit-call-is-unsurprising-but-it-has-symbolic-significance|title=The Sun's Brexit call is unsurprising but it has a symbolic significance|work=The Guardian|date=14 June 2016|accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref>

The editor, Larry Lamb, was originally from a Labour background with a socialist upbringing, while his temporary replacement Bernard Shrimsley (1972–75) was a middle-class uncommitted [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. An extensive advertising campaign on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network in this period, voiced by actor [[Christopher Timothy]],<ref>Léon Hunt ''British Low Culture: From Safari Suits to Sexploitation'', London: Routledge, 1998, p.27</ref> may have helped ''The Sun'' to overtake the ''Daily Mirror''{{'s}} circulation in 1978.<ref>Kevin Williams ''Read All About It!: A History of the British Newspaper'', Abingdon: Routledge, 2010, p.197</ref> Despite the industrial relations of the 1970s – the so-called "[[Spanish practices]]" of the print unions – ''The Sun'' was very profitable, enabling Murdoch to expand his operations to the [[List of newspapers in the United States|United States]] from 1973.

=== Thatcher years ===
==== Changes ====
In 1979, the paper endorsed [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the year's [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]] at the end of a process which had been under way for some time, though ''The Sun'' had not initially been enthusiastic about Thatcher. On 3 May 1979, it ran the unequivocal front-page headline, "VOTE TORY THIS TIME".<ref name=":2">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1366801/Sir-Larry-Lamb.html Obituary: Larry Lamb], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 20 May 2000</ref>

The ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' had been launched in 1978 by Express Newspapers, and by 1981 had begun to affect sales of ''The Sun''. [[Bingo (Commonwealth)|Bingo]] was introduced as a marketing tool, and a 2p drop in cover price removed the ''Daily Star''{{'}}s competitive advantage, opening a new circulation battle which resulted in ''The Sun'' neutralising the threat of the new paper.<ref name="Page331">Bruce Page ''The Murdoch Archipelago'', London: Simon & Schuster, 2003 [2004], p.331</ref> The new editor of ''The Sun'', [[Kelvin MacKenzie]], took up his post in 1981 just after those developments,<ref>Greenslade, p.421</ref> and, according to Bruce Page, "changed the British tabloid concept more profoundly than [Larry] Lamb did". Under MacKenzie,<ref name="Page331"/> the paper became "more outrageous, opinionated and irreverent than anything ever produced in Britain".<ref>John Thomas ''Popular Newspapers, the Labour Party and British Politics'', London: Routledge, 2005, p.89</ref>

==== Falklands War ====
[[File:The Sun (Gotcha).png|thumb|upright|Front page of ''The Sun'' (4 May 1982) in early editions following the torpedoing of the ''[[ARA General Belgrano|Belgrano]]''. This headline was published before it was known the sinking of the vessel had cost 368 lives.<ref name="Page333">Bruce Page ''The Murdoch Archipelago'', London: Simon & Schuster, 2003, p.333</ref>]]
''The Sun'' became an ardent supporter of the [[Falklands War]]. The coverage "captured the zeitgeist", according to [[Roy Greenslade]], assistant editor at the time (though privately an opponent of the war), but was also "xenophobic, bloody-minded, ruthless, often reckless, black-humoured and ultimately triumphalist."<ref name="Greenslade2002">Roy Greenslade [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/feb/25/pressandpublishing.falklands "A new Britain, a new kind of newspaper"], ''The Guardian'', 25 February 2002</ref>

On 1 May, ''The Sun'' claimed to have "[[sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]]" a British missile. Under the headline "Stick This Up Your Junta: A Sun missile for Galtieri’s gauchos",<ref>''The Sun'', 1 May 1982, cited in Greenslade ''Press Gang'', p.444</ref> the newspaper published a photograph of a missile (actually a [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris missile]] stock shot from the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]) which had a large ''Sun'' logo printed on its side with the caption "Here It Comes, Senors..." underneath.<ref name="Greenslade2002"/><ref name="Chippindale138">Chippindale & Horrie, p.138</ref> The paper explained that it was "sponsoring" the missile by contributing to the eventual victory party on {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} when the war ended. In copy written by [[Wendy Henry]], the paper said that the missile would shortly be used against Argentinian forces. Tony Snow, ''The Sun'' journalist on ''Invincible'' who had "signed" the missile, reported a few days later that it had hit an Argentinian target.<ref name="Greenslade2002"/><ref name="Chippindale138"/>

One of the paper's best known front pages, published on 4 May 1982, commemorated the torpedoing of the Argentine ship the ''[[ARA General Belgrano|General Belgrano]]'' by running the story under the headline "GOTCHA".<ref name="BJR">{{cite journal|last=Richmond|first=Shane|year=2008|title=How SEO is changing journalism|journal=British Journalism Review|volume=19|issue=4|pages=51–55|doi=10.1177/0956474808100865|s2cid=62235664|url=http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2008/no4_richmond|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121223233611/http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2008/no4_richmond|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 December 2012|accessdate=29 April 2009}}</ref> At MacKenzie's insistence, and against the wishes of Murdoch (the mogul was present because almost all the journalists were on strike),<ref name="Greenslade445">Roy Greenslade ''Press Gang'', London: Pan Macmillan, 2003 [2004], p.445</ref> the headline was changed for later editions after the extent of Argentinian casualties became known.<ref name="Page333"/><ref name=ChippindaleCh7>{{cite book | last1 = Chippindale | first1 = Peter | last2 = Horrie | first2 = Chris | title = Stick it up your punter! : the uncut story of the Sun newspaper (Chapter 7) | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780671017828 }}</ref> John Shirley, a reporter for ''The Sunday Times'', witnessed copies of this edition of ''The Sun'' being thrown overboard by sailors and marines on {{HMS|Fearless|L10|6}}.<ref name="Greenslade445"/>

After {{HMS|Sheffield|D80|6}} was wrecked by an Argentinian attack, ''The Sun'' was heavily criticised and even mocked in the ''Daily Mirror'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' for its coverage of the war, and the wider media queried the veracity of official information and worried about the number of casualties, ''The Sun'' gave its response. "There are traitors in our midst", wrote leader writer Ronald Spark on 7 May, accusing commentators on ''Daily Mirror'' and ''The Guardian'', plus the BBC's defence correspondent [[Peter Snow]], of "treason" for aspects of their coverage.<ref>''The Sun'', 7 May 1982, cited in Chippindale & Horrie, p.146; Bruce Page ''The Murdoch Archipelago'', London: Pocket Books, 2003, p.334</ref>

The [[satirical]] magazine ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' mocked and lampooned what they regarded as the paper's [[jingoistic]] coverage, most memorably with the mock-''Sun'' headline "KILL AN ARGIE, WIN A [[Rover Metro|METRO]]!", to which MacKenzie is said to have jokingly responded, "Why didn't we think of that?"<ref name="Greenslade2002"/>

==== ''The Sun'' and the Labour Party ====
These years included what was called "spectacularly malicious coverage"<ref>Nick Davies ''Flat Earth News'', London: Chatto & Windus, p.198</ref> of the Labour Party by ''The Sun'' and other newspapers. During the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1983]], ''The Sun'' ran a front page featuring an unflattering photograph of [[Michael Foot]], then aged almost 70, claiming he was unfit to be Prime Minister on grounds of his age, appearance and policies, alongside the headline "Do You Really Want This Old Fool To Run Britain?"<ref name=StillShines>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1209115.stm "Sun still shines for Blair"], BBC News, 8 March 2001;</ref> A year later, in 1984, ''The Sun'' made clear its enthusiastic support for the re-election of [[Ronald Reagan]] as president in the USA. Reagan was two weeks off his 74th birthday when he started his second term, in January 1985.

On 1 March 1984, the newspaper extensively quoted an American psychiatrist claiming that British left-wing politician [[Tony Benn]] was "insane", with the psychiatrist discussing various aspects of Benn's supposed pathology.<ref>"Benn on the couch", ''The Sun'', 1 March 1984</ref> The story, which appeared on the day of the [[1984 Chesterfield by-election|Chesterfield by-election]] in which Benn was standing, was discredited when the psychiatrist quoted by ''The Sun'' publicly denounced the article, describing the false quotes attributed to him as "absurd". ''The Sun'' had apparently fabricated the entire piece. The newspaper made frequent scathing attacks on what the paper called the "[[loony left]]" element within the Labour Party<ref>''The Sun'' "popularized the phrase" according to Ivor Crewe and Anthony King in ''SDP: the Birth, Life and Death of the Social Democratic Party'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, p.367</ref> and on institutions supposedly controlled by it. [[Ken Livingstone]], the leader of the left-wing [[Greater London Council]], was described as "the most odious man in Britain"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/11/13/profile_ken_livingstone_feature.shtml "London: Candidates & Parties"], BBC News, 20 May 2008</ref> in October 1981.<ref>James Curran, et al.

During the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike of 1984–85]], ''The Sun'' supported the police and the Thatcher government against the striking [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|NUM]] miners, and in particular the union's president, [[Arthur Scargill]]. On 23 May 1984, ''The Sun'' prepared a front page with the headline "Mine [[Führer]]" and a photograph of Scargill with his arm in the air, a pose which made him look as though he was giving a [[Nazi salute]]. The print workers at ''The Sun'' refused to print it.<ref>Greg Philo ''War and Peace News'', Open University Press, 1985, p.138.</ref> ''The Sun'' strongly supported the April 1986 bombing of [[Libya]] by the US, which was launched from British bases.

During the 1987 general election, ''The Sun'' ran a mock-editorial entitled "Why I'm Backing [[Neil Kinnock|Kinnock]], by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1987_camp.stm "1987: Three on the trot for Thatcher"], BBC News Vote 2001.

==== Murdoch's response ====
Murdoch responded to some of the criticisms of the newspaper by saying that critics were "snobs" who want to "impose their tastes on everyone else". MacKenzie claimed the same critics were people who, if they ever had a "popular idea", would have to "go and lie down in a dark room for half an hour". Both have pointed to the huge commercial success of the ''Sun'' during that period, and its establishment as Britain's top-selling newspaper, claiming that they are "giving the public what they want". That conclusion was disputed by critics. [[John Pilger]] said that a late-1970s edition of the ''Daily Mirror'', which replaced the usual celebrity and domestic political news items with an entire issue devoted to his own front-line reporting of the [[Cambodian genocide|genocide in Pol Pot's Cambodia]], not only outsold ''The Sun'' on the day it was issued, but became the only edition of the ''Daily Mirror'' to ever sell every single copy issued, something never achieved by ''The Sun''.

In January 1986, Murdoch shut down the Bouverie Street premises of ''The Sun'' and ''News of the World'', and moved operations to the new [[Wapping]] complex in East London, substituting the electricians' union for the print unions as his production staff's representatives, and greatly reducing the number of staff employed to print the papers. A year-long [[picketing (protest)|picket]] by sacked workers was eventually defeated (see [[Wapping dispute]]).

==== "Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster" ====
[[File:Freddiehamster.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster", 13 March 1986]]
During that period, ''The Sun'' gained a reputation for running sensationalist stories of questionable veracity. On 13 March 1986, the newspaper published one of its best known headlines: "FREDDIE STARR ATE MY HAMSTER".

The story alleged that British comedian [[Freddie Starr]], while staying at the home of a writer and old friend of his named Vince McCaffrey and his partner Lea LaSalle<ref name="Clifford">Max Clifford and Angela Levin ''Max Clifford: Read All About It'', London: Random House, 2010, p.123</ref> in [[Birchwood]], Cheshire, had, after returning from a performance at a nightclub in the early hours, found little to eat in their house. LaSalle was reported as saying that Starr put her pet hamster "between two slices of bread and started eating it".<ref>Chippindale, Peter; Horrie, Chris (1999). ''Stick it up your punter!'', p.233, The account in this book deviates from the version in the 2012 book co-written by Max Clifford. For example, Vince McCaffrey's first name is given as Tom, while La Salle is Starr's ex-girlfriend.</ref>

According to ''Max Clifford: Read All About It'', written by Clifford and Angela Levin, La Salle invented the story out of frustration with Starr, who had been working on a book with McCaffrey. She contacted an acquaintance who worked for ''The Sun'' in Manchester. The story reportedly delighted MacKenzie, who was keen to run it, and Max Clifford, who had been Starr's public relations agent.<ref name="Clifford"/> Starr had to be persuaded that the apparent revelation would not damage him, and the attention helped to revive his career.<ref>Clifford & Lewin, p125; Chippindale & Horrie, p.235</ref> In his 2001 autobiography ''Unwrapped'', Starr wrote that the incident was a complete fabrication: "I have never eaten or even nibbled a live hamster, gerbil, guinea pig, mouse, shrew, vole or any other small mammal."<ref>{{cite book |title=Unwrapped |last=Starr |first=Freddie |year=2001 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=UK |isbn=1-85227-961-3 |page=300 }}</ref>

==== Elton John and other celebrities ====
Fuelled by MacKenzie's preoccupation with the subject, stories in ''The Sun'' spread rumours about the sexual orientation of famous people, especially pop stars.<ref>Chippindale & Horrie, p.305-6</ref>

''The Sun'' ran a series of false stories about [[Elton John]] from 25 February 1987, which eventually resulted in a total of 17 libel writs.<ref>Roy Greenslade ''Press Gang'', p.499, 736, n.93</ref> They began with an invented account of the singer having sexual relationships with rent boys. The singer-songwriter was abroad on the day indicated in the story, as former ''Sun'' journalist [[John Blake (journalist)|John Blake]], recently poached by the ''Daily Mirror'', soon discovered.<ref>Roy Greenslade ''Press Gang'', p.499; Chippindale & Horrie, p.315</ref> After further stories, in September 1987, ''The Sun'' accused John of having his [[Rottweiler]] guard dogs' [[surgical debarking|voice boxes surgically removed]].<ref name="Chippindale322">Chippindale & Horrie, p.322</ref> In November, the ''Daily Mirror'' found their rival's only source for the rent boy story, who admitted it was a totally fictitious concoction created for money.<ref>Chippindale & Horrie, p.322; Roy Greenslade ''Press Gang'', p.499, 736, n.96</ref> The inaccurate story about his dogs, actually [[German Shepherd|Alsatians]],<ref name="Chippindale322"/> put pressure on ''The Sun'', and John received £1&nbsp;million in an out-of-court settlement, then the largest damages payment in British history. ''The Sun'' ran a front-page apology on 12 December 1988, under the banner headline "SORRY, ELTON".<ref>Chippindale & Horrie, p.323-24; Greenslade, p.499, 736, n.97</ref>

In May 1987, gay men were offered free one-way airline tickets to Norway to leave Britain for good: "Fly Away Gays – And We Will Pay" was the paper's headline.<ref>Simon Watney [https://archive.org/details/policingdesirepo00watn/page/147 ''Policing Desire: Pornography, AIDS, And the Media''], Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1996, p.147</ref> Gay Church of England clergymen were described in one headline in November 1987 as "Pulpit poofs".<ref>Terry Sanderson ''Mediawatch: The Treatment of Male and Female Homosexuality in the British Media'', London: Cassell, 1995, p.179</ref>

Television personality [[Piers Morgan]], a former editor of the ''Daily Mirror'' and of ''The Sun''{{'}}s "Bizarre" pop column, has said that during the late 1980s, at Kelvin MacKenzie's behest, he was ordered to speculate on the sexuality of male pop stars for a feature headlined "The Poofs of Pop".<ref name="Morgan05">{{cite news |last=Morgan |first=Piers |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1498649/No-stereotypes-were-harmed-in-the-making-of-this-film.html?pageNum=2 |title=No stereotypes were harmed in the making of this film |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 September 2005 |accessdate=19 January 2009}}</ref> He also recalls MacKenzie headlining a January 1989 story about the first same-sex kiss on the BBC television soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' as "EastBenders",<ref name="Morgan05"/> describing the kiss between [[Colin Russell (EastEnders)|Colin Russell]] and [[Guido Smith]] as "a homosexual love scene between yuppie poofs ... when millions of children were watching".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Owen |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/one-day-coming-out-wont-be-a-thing--and-the-reaction-to-tom-daleys-announcement-shows-were-getting-there-8977908.html|title=One day 'coming out' won't be a thing – and the reaction to Tom Daley's announcement shows we're getting there|work=The Independent|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref>

In 1990, the Press Council adjudicated against ''The Sun'' and columnist [[Garry Bushell]] for their use of derogatory terminology about gay people.<ref>Peter Beherrell "AIDS and the British Press" in John Eldridge (ed.)

====Birmingham Six====

In January 1988 the Sun described [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]]’s efforts on behalf of the wrongly convicted [[Birmingham Six]] as being "Loony MP Backs Bomb Gang" and "If the Sun had its way, we would have been tempted to string ‘em up years ago".<Ref>Error of Judgement, by Chris Mullin Poolbeg Press, 1990, p.310.</Ref>

==== AIDS ====
''The Sun'' responded to the health crisis on 8 May 1983 with the headline: "US Gay Blood Plague Kills Three in Britain".<ref>Julian Petley "Positive and Negative Images" in James Curran (et al., eds) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ocdFS3CJKMQC&pg=PA160 ''Culture Wars: The Media and the British Left''], Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003, p.160</ref>

On 17 November 1989, ''The Sun'' headlined a page 2 news story titled "STRAIGHT SEX CANNOT GIVE YOU AIDS – OFFICIAL."<ref name="truth"/> ''The Sun'' favourably cited the opinions of [[John Godley, 3rd Baron Kilbracken|Lord Kilbracken]], a member of the [[All-Party Parliamentary Group|All Parliamentary Group on AIDS]], who had said that only one person out of the 2,372 individuals with [[HIV/AIDS]] mentioned in a specific [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] report was not a member of a "high risk group", such as homosexuals and recreational drug users. ''The Sun'' also ran an editorial arguing that "At last the truth can be told ... the risk of catching AIDS if you are heterosexual is 'statistically invisible'. In other words, impossible. So now we know – everything else is homosexual propaganda". Although many other British press services covered Lord Kilbracken's public comments, none of them echoed the argument in the ''Sun'', and none of them presented Lord Kilbracken's ideas without context or criticism.<ref name="truth">{{cite book|author=John Eldridge|title=Getting the Message: News, Truth, and Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bjiIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA198|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-89583-0|pages=196–226}}</ref>

Critics stated that both ''The Sun'' and Lord Kilbracken [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picked]] the results from one specific study while ignoring other data on HIV infection and not just AIDS infection, which the critics viewed as unethical politicisation of a medical issue. Lord Kilbracken himself criticised ''The Sun''{{'s}} editorial and the headline of its news story, stating that, while he thought that gay people were more at risk of developing AIDS, it was still wrong to imply that no one else could catch the disease. The [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]] condemned ''The Sun'' for committing what it called a "gross distortion". ''The Sun'' later published an apology, which was run on Page 28. Journalist [[David Randall]] argued in the textbook ''The Universal Journalist'' that the story in  ''The Sun'' was one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent history, putting its own readers in harm's way.<ref name=truth/><ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-7453-1641-3|title=The universal journalist|first=David|last=Randall|page=135|year=2000|publisher=[[Pluto Press]]}}</ref>

At the end of the decade, ''The Sun''{{'}}s coverage of the Hillsborough football stadium disaster in [[Sheffield]] on 15 April 1989, in which 96 people died as a result of their injuries, proved to be, as the paper later admitted, the "most terrible" blunder in its history.<ref>"The Sun Says" (editorial), ''The Sun'', 7 July 2004</ref>

===== Total Eclipse of the S*n Campaign =====
In response to The Sun's involvement in the Hillsborough scandal and the reporting of the article in 1989, the Total Eclipse of the S*n Campaign was launched in Liverpool. The Campaign received a large boost when the Hillsborough Inquest in 2017 formally recognized that the fans were not to blame for the disaster, and all lies and information circulated by The Sun were part of a larger cover-up for unlawful killing.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Conn|first=David|date=2016-04-26|title=Hillsborough inquests jury rules 96 victims were unlawfully killed|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-inquests-jury-says-96-victims-were-unlawfully-killed|access-date=2020-10-13|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> It aims to spread awareness about the disaster, remember the victims and their families, and support shops who Boycott sales of The Sun newspaper.<ref>{{Cite web|last=sun|first=Total Eclipse of the|title=Total Eclipse of the s*n|url=https://totaleclipseofthesun.org/|access-date=2020-10-13|website=Total Eclipse of the sun|language=en-GB}}</ref> Journalist Suzanne Moore wrote in response to the verdict: "This fantasy should be well and truly shattered by the Hillsborough verdict.

===== ''Later repercussions'' =====
On 7 July 2004, in response to verbal attacks in Liverpool on [[Wayne Rooney]], just before his transfer from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], who had sold his life story to ''The Sun'', the paper devoted a full-page editorial to an apology for the "awful error" of its Hillsborough coverage and argued that Rooney (who was only three years old at the time of Hillsborough) should not be punished for its "past sins". In January 2005, ''The Sun''{{'s}} managing editor [[Graham Dudman]] admitting the Hillsborough coverage was "the worst mistake in our history", added: "What we did was a terrible mistake. It was a terrible, insensitive, horrible article, with a dreadful headline; but what we'd also say is: we have apologised for it, and the entire senior team here now is completely different from the team that put the paper out in 1989."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jan/31/sun.mondaymediasection |title=No end to the Sun's sorry tale|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 31 January 2005|accessdate=19 January 2009| first=Mark | last=Lupton}}</ref>

In May 2006, Kelvin MacKenzie, ''Sun'' editor at the time of the Hillsborough disaster, returned to the paper as a columnist. Furthermore, on 11 January 2007, MacKenzie stated, while a panellist on BBC1's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'', that the apology he made about the coverage was a hollow one, forced upon him by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. MacKenzie further claimed he was not sorry "for telling the truth" but he admitted that he did not know whether some Liverpool fans urinated on the police, or robbed victims.<ref>{{cite news|title =No apology for Hillsborough story|work=BBC News|date= 12 January 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/6254767.stm|accessdate =23 February 2007}}</ref>

On 12 September 2012, following the publication of the official report into the disaster using previously withheld Government papers which officially [[exonerated]] the Liverpool fans present, MacKenzie issued the following statement:
{{quote|Today I offer my profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool for that headline. I too was totally misled. Twenty three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable news agency in Sheffield [White's] in which a senior police officer and a senior local MP [Sheffield Hallam MP [[Irvine Patnick]]] were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium. I had absolutely no reason to believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster. As the Prime Minister has made clear these allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters thereby shifting the blame for the tragedy from themselves. It has taken more than two decades, 400,000 documents and a two-year inquiry to discover to my horror that it would have been far more accurate had I written the headline "The Lies" rather than "The Truth". I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong.}}

Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected Mr MacKenzie's apology as "too little, too late", calling him "[[lowlife]], clever lowlife, but lowlife".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9538782/Hillsborough-Kelvin-MacKenzie-offers-profuse-apologies-to-the-people-of-Liverpool.html |title=Hillsborough: Kelvin MacKenzie offers 'profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool' |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>

Following the publication of the report ''The Sun'' apologised on its front page, under the headline "The Real Truth". With the newspaper's editor at the time, Dominic Mohan, adding underneath:
{{quote|It's a version of events that 23 years ago ''The Sun'' went along with and for that we're deeply ashamed and profoundly sorry.

The newspaper was banned by [[Everton F.C.]] in April after ''The Sun'' published a column by former editor Kelvin MacKenzie the day before the 28th anniversary of the disaster which included a passage about footballer [[Ross Barkley]] that was considered "appalling and indefensible" and included a racist epithet and insults against the people of Liverpool.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39608149|title=Everton ban the Sun after Ross Barkley article|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 April 2017|accessdate=15 April 2017}}</ref> Access to the club grounds and facilities for ''Sun'' reporters were blocked.

''The Sun'' remained loyal to Thatcher right up to her resignation in November 1990,<ref>"Maggie is the Tories' Only Hope", ''The Sun'', 29 October 1990, cited in Roy Greenslade ''Press Gang: How Newspaper's Make Profits From Propanganda'', London: Macmillan, p.548, 740, n.59</ref> despite the party's fall in popularity over the previous year following the introduction of the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]] (officially known as the Community Charge). This change to the way local government is funded was vociferously supported by the newspaper, despite widespread opposition, (some from Conservative MPs), which is seen as having contributed to Thatcher's own downfall. The tax was quickly repealed by her successor [[John Major]], whom ''The Sun'' initially supported enthusiastically,<ref>"Major By a Mile", "Why We Say It Must Be Major", ''The Sun'', 26 November 1990, p.1, 6, cited by Roy Greenslade ''Press Gang: How Newspaper's Make Profits From Propanganda'', London: Macmillan, p.550, 741, n.78</ref> believing the former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] was a radical Thatcherite.

On the day of the general election of 9 April 1992, its front-page headline, encapsulating its antipathy towards the Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock]], read "If Kinnock wins today, will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights". Two days later ''The Sun'' was so convinced its front page had swung a close election for the Conservatives it declared "[[It's The Sun Wot Won It]]".

''The Sun'' led with a headline "Now we've all been screwed by the cabinet" with a reference to [[Black Wednesday]] on 17 September 1992, and the exposure a few months earlier of an extra-marital affair in which Cabinet Minister [[David Mellor]] was involved.<ref>''The Sun'', 17 September 1992</ref> A month later, on 14 October, it attacked [[Michael Heseltine]] for the mass coal [[mine closure]]s.

Despite its initial opposition to the closures, until 1997, the newspaper repeatedly called for the implementation of further Thatcherite policies, such as [[Royal Mail]] privatisation,<ref>The Sun – 3 November 1994</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2011}} and social security cutbacks, with leaders such as "Peter Lilley is right, we can't carry on like this".<ref>The Sun – July 1993</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2011}} The paper showed hostility to the [[European Union]] (EU) and approval of public spending cuts, tax cuts, and promotion of right-wing ministers to the cabinet, with leaders such as "More of the Redwood, not Deadwood".<ref>The Sun – 1994</ref>

''The Sun'' attacked Labour leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] in February 1994, for saying that more British troops should be sent to [[Bosnia]]. ''The Sun''{{'s}} comment was that "The only serious radicals in British politics these days are the likes of Redwood, Lilley and Portillo".<ref>''The Sun'' – February 1994</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2011}} It also gradually expressed its bitter disillusionment with John Major as Prime Minister, with headlines such as "What fools we were to back John Major".<ref>''The Sun'' – 14 January 1994</ref>

Between 1994 and 1996, ''The Sun''{{'s}} circulation peaked. Its highest average sale was in the week ending 16 July 1994, when the daily figure was 4,305,957. The highest ever one-day sale was on 18 November 1995 (4,889,118), although the cover price had been cut to 10p. The highest ever one-day sale at full price was on 30 March 1996 (4,783,359).<ref>News International Circulation Reports Archive</ref>

On 22 January 1997, ''The Sun'' accused the shadow chancellor [[Gordon Brown]] of stealing the Conservatives' ideas by declaring, "If all he is offering is Conservative financial restraint, why not vote for the real thing?"<ref>The Sun, 22 January 1997</ref> and called the planned windfall tax, which was later imposed by the Labour government, "wrongheaded".<ref>The Sun, 15 February 1997</ref> In February 1997 it told Sir [[Edward Heath]] MP to stand down for supporting a national minimum wage.<ref>''The Sun'', 26 February 1997</ref>

==== Support for New Labour ====
''The Sun'' switched support to the Labour party on 18 March 1997, six weeks before the General Election victory which saw the [[New Labour]] leader [[Tony Blair]] become Prime Minister with a large parliamentary majority, despite the paper having attacked Blair and New Labour up to a month earlier. Its front-page headline read THE SUN BACKS BLAIR and its front-page editorial made clear that while it still opposed some New Labour policies, such as the minimum wage and devolution, it believed Blair to be "the breath of fresh air this great country needs".<ref name="archive1997">''The Sun'', 18 March 1997</ref> John Major's Conservatives, it said, were "tired, divided and rudderless".<ref name="archive1997"/> Blair, who had radically altered his party's image and policies, noting the influence the paper could have over its readers' political thinking, had courted it (and Murdoch) for some time by granting exclusive interviews and writing columns.

In exchange for Rupert Murdoch's support, Blair agreed not to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] which John Major had [[Black Wednesday|withdrawn the country from]] in September 1992 after barely two years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/pip/tor8v/?focuswin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111015633/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/pip/tor8v/?focuswin |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 January 2009 |title=A Very Special Relationship |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=5 February 2007 |accessdate=19 January 2009  }}</ref> Cabinet Minister [[Peter Mandelson]] was "outed" by [[Matthew Parris]] (a former ''Sun'' columnist) on BBC TV's ''[[Newsnight]]'' in November 1998. Misjudging public response, ''The Sun''{{'s}} editor David Yelland demanded to know in a front-page editorial whether Britain was governed by a "gay mafia" of a "closed world of men with a mutual self-interest". Three days later the paper apologised in another editorial which said ''The Sun'' would never again reveal a person's sexuality unless it could be defended on the grounds of "overwhelming public interest".

In 2003, the paper was accused of racism by the government over its criticisms of what it perceived as the "open door" policy on immigration. The attacks came from the Prime Minister's press spokesman [[Alastair Campbell]] and the Home Secretary [[David Blunkett]] (later a ''Sun'' columnist). The paper rebutted the claim, believing that it was not racist to suggest that a "tide" of unchecked illegal immigrants was increasing the risk of terrorist attacks and infectious diseases. It did not help its argument by publishing a front-page story on 4 July 2003, under the headline "Swan Bake", which claimed that asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans. It later proved to have no basis in fact. Subsequently, ''The Sun'' published a follow-up headlined "Now they're after our fish!". Following a [[Press Complaints Commission]] adjudication a "clarification" was eventually printed, on page 41.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=24624&sectioncode=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211123001/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=24624&sectioncode=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 December 2008 |title=Sun accused of Swan Bake 'myth-making' |work=Press Gazette |date=19 December 2003 |accessdate=19 January 2009  }}</ref> In 2005 ''The Sun'' published photographs of Prince Harry sporting a Nazi costume to a fancy dress party.

Despite being a persistent critic of some of the government's policies, the paper supported Labour in both subsequent elections the party won. For the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], ''The Sun'' backed Blair and Labour for a third consecutive election win and vowed to give him "one last chance" to fulfil his promises, despite berating him for several weaknesses including a failure to control immigration. However, it did speak of its hope that the Conservatives (led by [[Michael Howard]]) would one day be fit for a return to government.<ref name=StillShines/> This election (Blair had declared it would be his last as prime minister) resulted in Labour's third successive win but with a much reduced majority.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4519863.stm Blair secures historic third term] BBC News, 6 May 2005</ref>

On 22 September 2003, the newspaper appeared to misjudge the public mood surrounding mental health, as well as its affection for former world heavyweight champion boxer [[Frank Bruno]], who had been admitted to hospital, when the headline "Bonkers Bruno Locked Up" appeared on the front page of early editions. The adverse reaction, once the paper had hit the streets on the evening of 21 September, led to the headline being changed for the paper's second edition to the more sympathetic "Sad Bruno in Mental Home".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/sep/23/pressandpublishing.mentalhealth|title=Sun on the ropes over 'Bonkers Bruno' story|date=23 September 2003|work=The Guardian|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=19 October 2009|first=Owen | last=Gibson}}</ref>

''The Sun'' has been openly antagonistic towards other European nations, particularly the French and Germans. During the 1980s and 1990s, the nationalities were routinely described in copy and headlines as "frogs", "krauts" or "hun". As the paper is opposed to the EU it has referred to foreign leaders who it deemed hostile to the UK in unflattering terms. Former President [[Jacques Chirac]] of France, for instance, was branded "le Worm". An unflattering picture of German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], taken from the rear, bore the headline "I'm Big in the Bumdestag" (17 April 2006).

Although ''The Sun'' was outspoken against the racism directed at [[Bollywood]] actress [[Shilpa Shetty]] on television reality show ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' during 2007, the paper captioned a picture on its website, from a Bollywood-themed pop video by [[Hilary Duff]], "Hilary [[Papadum|PoppaDuff]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holymoly.co.uk/news/28/the-sun-online-catches-the-jade-goody-bug-1134.html |title=The Sun online catches the Jade Goody bug |publisher=Holy Moly! |accessdate=19 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905013642/http://www.holymoly.co.uk/news/28/the-sun-online-catches-the-jade-goody-bug-1134.html |archivedate=5 September 2008 }}</ref> a very similar insult to that directed at Shetty.

On 7 January 2009, ''The Sun'' ran an exclusive front-page story claiming that participants in a discussion on Ummah.com, a [[British Muslim]] [[internet forum]], had made a "hate hit list" of [[British Jews]] to be targeted by extremists over the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]. It was claimed that "Those listed [on the forum] should treat it very seriously. Expect a hate campaign and intimidation by 20 or 30 thugs." The UK magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' claimed that [[Glen Jenvey]], a man quoted by ''The Sun'' as a terrorism expert, who had been posting to the forum under the pseudonym "Abuislam", was the only forum member promoting a hate campaign while other members promoted peaceful advocacy, such as writing "polite letters". The story has since been removed from ''The Sun''{{'s}} website following complaints to the UK's [[Press Complaints Commission]].<ref>{{Cite news | date = 21 January 2009 | title = How Extremism Works | periodical = [[Private Eye]] | place = London | publisher=Pressdram Ltd | issue = 1228 | page = 4 }}</ref>

In January 2008, the [[Wapping]] presses printed ''The Sun'' for the last time and London printing was transferred to [[Waltham Cross]] in the Borough of [[Broxbourne]] in Hertfordshire,<ref>Stephen Brook [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/25/sun.newsinternational1 "Sun sets on Wapping printworks"], ''The Guardian'', 25 January 2008</ref> where News International had built what is claimed to be the largest printing centre in Europe with 12 presses.

Northern printing had earlier been switched to a new plant at Knowsley on Merseyside and the ''Scottish Sun'' to another new plant at Motherwell near Glasgow.

==== 2009: ''The Sun'' returns to the Conservatives ====
{{further|Rupert Murdoch#Political activities}}
Politically, the paper's stance was less clear under Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] who succeeded Blair in June 2007. Its editorials were critical of many of Brown's policies and often more supportive of those of Conservative leader [[David Cameron]]. [[Rupert Murdoch]], head of ''The Sun''{{'}}s parent company News Corporation, speaking at a 2007 meeting with the [[House of Lords]] Select Committee on Communications, which was investigating media ownership and the news, said that he acts as a "traditional proprietor". This means he exercises editorial control on major issues such as which political party to back in a general election or which policy to adopt on Europe.<ref name=Parliament070917>{{cite conference|title=Minute of the meeting with Mr Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, News Corporation |booktitle=Inquiry into Media Ownership and the News |pages=10 |publisher=House of Commons Select Committee on Communications |date=17 September 2007 |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/us.doc |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201082014/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/us.doc |archivedate=1 December 2007 }}

With "[[Broken Britain]]" controversies on issues like crime, immigration and public service failures in the news, on 30 September 2009, following Brown's speech at the Labour Party Conference, ''The Sun'', under the banner "Labour's Lost It", announced that it no longer supported the Labour Party:<ref>[http://www.supanet.com/business--money/which-political-parties-do-the-newspapers-support--25923p1.html "Which political parties do the newspapers support?"] Supanet</ref> "''The Sun'' believes – and prays – that the Conservative leadership can put the great back into Great Britain".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Greenslade|first1=Roy|title=The Sun's political switch is no surprise|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2009/sep/29/sun-conservatives|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Guardian|date=29 September 2009}}</ref>

That day at the Labour Party Conference, union leader [[Tony Woodley]] responded by ripping up a copy of that edition of ''The Sun'', remarking as he did so in reference to the newspaper's Hillsborough Disaster controversy: "In Liverpool we learnt a long time ago what to do".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8282535.stm?ls |title=Harman turns fire on Sun decision |work=BBC News  |date=30 September 2009|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> One attack on Gordon Brown backfired at around this time.

The ''Scottish Sun'' did not back either Labour or the Conservatives, with its editorial stating it was "yet to be convinced" by the Conservative opposition, and editor David Dinsmore asking in an interview "what is David Cameron going to do for Scotland?".<ref name=":3">{{cite news|work=The Guardian |location=UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/30/scottish-sun-tories|title=Scottish Sun stops short of backing Tories|date=30 September 2009| first=John | last=Plunkett | accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8282021.stm|title=Scottish Sun not backing Tories|date=30 September 2009}}</ref> Dinsmore also stated that the paper supported the Union, and was unlikely to back the [[Scottish National Party]].

During the campaign for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], ''[[The Independent]]'' ran ads declaring that "Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election – you will." In response [[James Murdoch (media executive)|James Murdoch]] and [[Rebekah Wade]] "appeared unannounced and uninvited on the editorial floor" of the ''Independent'', and had an energetic conversation with its editor [[Simon Kelner]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/apr/22/murdoch-wade-crash-independent Murdoch-Wade posse crash Independent's office – that's pretty uncool, isn't it?] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 April 2010</ref> Several days later the ''Independent'' reported ''The Sun''{{'s}} failure to report its own [[YouGov]] poll result which said that "if people thought Mr Clegg's party had a significant chance of winning the election" the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] would win 49% of the vote, and with it a landslide majority.<ref name=ind230410>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sun-censored-poll-that-showed-support-for-lib-dems-1951940.html 'Sun' censored poll that showed support for Lib Dems] ''[[The Independent]]'', 23 April 2010,</ref>

On [[2010 United Kingdom general election|election day]] (6 May 2010), ''The Sun'' urged its readers to vote for David Cameron's "modern and positive" Conservatives to save Britain from "disaster" which the paper thought the country would face if the Labour government was re-elected. The election ended in the first [[hung parliament]] after an election for [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|36 years]], with the Tories gaining the most seats and votes but being 20 seats short of an overall majority. They finally came to power on 11 May when Gordon Brown stepped down as prime minister, paving the way for David Cameron to become prime minister by forming a coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8676607.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Cameron and Clegg: We are united | date=12 May 2010}}</ref>

On 2 June 2013, ''The Sun on Sunday'' ran a front-page story on singer-songwriter [[Tulisa]].<ref name="Greenslade">Roy Greenslade [https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/jul/19/sun-on-sunday-tulisa-contostavlos "Tulisa 'entrapped by Sun on Sunday'"], ''The Guardian''.

It was claimed that Tulisa introduced three film producers (actually Mahmood and two other ''Sun'' journalists) to a drug dealer and set up an £800 deal.<ref name="Greenslade"/> The subterfuge involved conning the singer into believing that she was being considered for a role in an £8&nbsp;million Bollywood film.<ref>Adam Sherwin [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/questions-raised-over-the-suns-elaborate-tulisa-contostavlos-cocaine-sting-8659638.html "Questions raised over The Sun's elaborate Tulisa Contostavlos cocaine sting"], ''The Independent'', 14 June 2013</ref>

==== Trial of staff for misconduct in a public office ====
In October 2014, the trial of six senior staff and journalists at ''The Sun'' newspaper began. All six were charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office. They included ''The Sun''{{'}}s head of news Chris Pharo, who faced six charges, while ex-managing editor [[Graham Dudman]] and ex-''Sun'' deputy news editor Ben O'Driscoll were accused of four charges each. Thames Valley district reporter Jamie Pyatt and picture editor John Edwards were charged with three counts each, while ex-reporter John Troup was accused of two counts. The trial related to illegal payments allegedly made to public officials, with prosecutors saying the men conspired to pay officials from 2002 to 2011, including police, prison officers and soldiers. They were accused of buying confidential information about the Royal Family, public figures and prison inmates. They all denied the charges.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29645621|title=Sun staff made illegal payments on 'grand scale', court hears|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=16 October 2014 |work=BBC News | accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref> On 16 January 2015, Troup and Edwards were cleared by the jury of all charges against them.

Shortly afterwards, one of the jurors sent a note to the judge and was discharged. The judge told the remaining 11 jurors that their colleague had been "feeling unwell and feeling under a great deal of pressure and stress from the situation you are in", and that under the circumstances he was prepared to accept majority verdicts of "11 to zero or 10 to 1".<ref name="The Guardian 21 Jan 2015">{{cite news |last= O'Carroll |first= Lisa | title= Juror in trial of Sun journalists discharged due to 'pressure and stress'|url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/21/juror-discharged-sun-journalists-trial| date=21 January 2015| newspaper= The Guardian |location=London| accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref> On 22 January 2015, the jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the outstanding charges.

On 6 February 2015, it was announced that Judge Richard Marks was to be replaced by Judge Charles Wide at the retrial. Two days earlier, Marks had emailed counsel for the defendants, telling them: "It has been decided (not by me but by my elders and betters) that I am not going to be doing the retrial". Reporting the decision in UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', Lisa O'Carroll wrote: "Wide is the only judge so far to have presided in a case which has seen a conviction of a journalist in relation to allegations of unlawful payments to public officials for stories. The journalist, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is appealing the verdict". Defence counsel for the four journalists threatened to take the decision to judicial review, with the barrister representing Pharo, Nigel Rumfitt QC, saying: "The way this has come about gives rise to the impression that something has been going on behind the scenes which should not have been going on behind the scenes and which should have been dealt with transparently". He added that the defendants were "extremely concerned" and "entitled" to know why Marks was being replaced by Wide.<ref name="The Guardian 6 February 2015">{{cite news | title= Sun journalists retrial row after judge removed from case |url=  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/06/sun-journalists-retrial-row-after-judge-removed-from-case | last= O'Carroll| first= Lisa| date= 6 February 2015| newspaper= The Guardian| location= London | accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

In a separate trial, ''Sun'' reporter Nick Parker was cleared on 9 December 2014 of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office but found guilty of handling a stolen mobile phone belonging to Labour MP [[Siobhain McDonagh]].<ref name="BBC News 9 December 2014">{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30397952 |title=Sun journalist Nick Parker cleared of misconduct|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=9 December 2014 |work=BBC News | accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

On 22 May 2015, ''Sun'' reporter Anthony France was found guilty of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office between 2008 and 2011. France's trial followed the London [[Metropolitan Police]]'s [[Operation Elveden]], an ongoing investigation into alleged payments to police and officials in exchange for information. He had paid a total of more than £22,000 to PC Timothy Edwards, an anti-terrorism police officer based at Heathrow Airport. The police officer had already pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office and given a two-year jail sentence in 2014, but the jury in France's trial was not informed of this. Following the passing of the guilty verdict, the officer leading Operation Elveden, Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs said France and Edwards had been in a "long-term, corrupt relationship".<ref name="BBC News 22 May 2015">{{cite web | title= Sun reporter Anthony France guilty over police story tips|url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32852033| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 22 May 2015| work= BBC News | accessdate= 22 May 2015}}</ref>

The BBC reported that France was the first journalist to face trial and be convicted under Operation Elveden since the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had revised its guidance in April 2015 so that prosecutions would only be brought against journalists who had made payments to police officers over a period of time. As a result of the change in the CPS' policy, charges against several journalists who had made payments to other types of public officials – including civil servants, health workers and prison staff – had been dropped.<ref name="BBC News 22 May 2015"/> In July 2015, ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine reported that, at a costs hearing at the Old Bailey, ''The Sun''{{'s}} parent company had refused to pay for the prosecution costs relating to France's trial, leading the presiding judge to express his "considerable disappointment" at this state of affairs. Judge Timothy Pontius said in court that France's illegal actions had been part of a "clearly recognised procedure at ''The Sun''", adding that, "There can be no doubt that News International bears some measure of moral responsibility if not legal culpability for the acts of the defendant". The ''Private Eye'' report noted that despite this ''The Sun''{{'s}} parent organisation was "considering disciplinary actions" against France whilst at the same time it was also preparing to bring a case to the [[Investigatory Powers Tribunal]] against the London [[Metropolitan Police Service]] for its actions relating to him and two other journalists.<ref name="Private Eye 24 July 2015">{{cite news | title= Street of Shame| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 24 July 2015| work= [[Private Eye]] |issue= 1397| page= 8}}</ref>

In August 2017, ''The Sun'' published a column by [[Trevor Kavanagh]] which questioned what actions British society should take to deal with "The Muslim Problem".

A statement by the groups said, "The printing of the phrase 'The Muslim Problem'{{snd}} particularly with the capitalisation and italics for emphasis{{snd}} in a national newspaper sets a dangerous precedent, and harks back to the use of the phrase 'The [[Jewish problem]]' in the last century, to which the Nazis responded with 'The [[Final Solution]]'{{snd}} the [[Holocaust]]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Ponsford|first=Dominic|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/campaigner-unable-to-complain-over-sun-muslim-problem-piece-because-religious-groups-not-covered-by-editors-code/|title=Campaigner unable to complain over Sun 'Muslim problem' piece because religious groups not covered by Editors' Code|work=Press Gazette|date=15 August 2017|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref> A cross-party group of over 100 MPs from the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens subsequently signed a letter to the editor of ''The Sun'' demanding action over the column.

On 9 March 2016, ''The Sun''{{'}}s front page proclaimed that Queen [[Elizabeth II]] was backing [[Brexit]], a common term for a British withdrawal from the European Union. It claimed that in 2011 at [[Windsor Castle]], while having lunch with Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]], the monarch criticised the union.

In June 2018, ''The Sun'' provoked controversy after it criticised the dress worn by a 17-year-old actress, [[Isobel Steele]], to the British Soap Awards. The paper critiqued Steele for her decision to "cover up from head to toe" and told her to "flash a bit of flesh". The paper, and the journalist responsible for the piece, Tracey Lea Sayer, subsequently apologised.

The story prompted a statement from Stokes, calling the article the "lowest form of journalism" which dealt with "deeply personal and traumatic events" that affected his New Zealand-based family more than 30 years ago. ''The Sun'' defended its journalism; pointing out it had received the co-operation of a family member, it has commented that the events described were "a matter of public record" and "the subject of extensive front-page publicity in New Zealand at the time."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/49733464 |title=Ben Stokes: 'Country stands behind him' over row with ''Sun'', says cricket chief |date=17 September 2019 |work=[[BBC News]] }}</ref>

On 14 February 2020, a day before [[Caroline Flack]] was found dead in her [[Stoke Newington]] flat, ''The Sun'' published an article about a "brutal" Valentine's Day card mocking Flack on its website.

==== JK Rowling ====
In June 2020, shortly after [[J. K. Rowling|JK Rowling]] published a blog in which she described her first marriage as "violent", ''The Sun'' interviewed [[Jorge Arantes]], Rowling's former husband and published a front page article entitled "I slapped JK and I'm not sorry". In response, a number of domestic abuse charities criticised  the newspaper for  its handling of the story. The press regulator [[Independent Press Standards Organisation|Ipso]] reported that it had received more than 500 complaints about the article.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-06-12|title=Paper faces backlash for headline on Rowling's ex|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-53023543|access-date=2020-06-12}}</ref> The article was also criticized by British politicians with Opposition Labour MP Jess Phillips called the headline "awful," and Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, adding, "This reporting is unacceptable, glorifies domestic violence & disparages the millions of victims of domestic violence."<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/uk/jk-rowling-the-sun-front-page-scli-gbr-intl/index.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

==Circulation==
''The Sun'' has dominated the circulation figures for daily newspapers in the United Kingdom since the late 1970s, at times easily outpacing its nearest rivals, the ''Daily Mirror'' and the ''Daily Mail''. For a brief period in the late 1990s and early 2000s, this lead was more than a million copies per day. Sustained decline began in 2004, in line with print journalism as a whole, and it lost more than a million copies from its daily figures in the six-year period from 2012–18. ''The Sun''{{'}}s long run at the top was finally broken in February 2018 when it was announced that the circulation of the free ''Metro'' newspaper had overtaken it for the first time. However it remains the biggest-selling newspaper in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/national-newspaper-abcs-metro-climbs-above-the-suns-total-circulation-as-mirror-and-telegraph-titles-post-double-digit-drops/|title=National newspaper ABCs: Metro climbs above The Sun's total circulation as Mirror and Telegraph titles post double-digit drops|first=Charlotte|last=Tobitt|date=15 March 2018|work=Press Gazette}}</ref>

In February 2020, it was revealed that daily sales of ''The Sun'' had fallen 8% to 1.38 million in the year to July, but the publication remained the UK's biggest-selling paid-for paper. It was also revealed that ''The Sun on Sunday'' sold an average of 1.16 million copies a week, 111,000 fewer than the year before.<ref name="BBC News"/>

In April 2020 News UK instructed ABC that its circulation data should be kept private, and would only be shared with advertising agencies in confidence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/national-newsbrand-abc-sales-slump-during-uk-lockdown/|title=National newsbrand ABCs: Sales slump during UK lockdown|first=Freddy|last=Mayhew|date=21 May 2020|work=Press Gazette}}</ref>

== Other versions ==
=== ''The Scottish Sun'' ===
The Scottish edition of ''The Sun'' launched in 1987, known as ''The Scottish Sun''. Based in Glasgow, it duplicates much of the content of the main edition but with alternative coverage of Scottish news and sport. The launch editor was Jack Irvine who had been recruited from the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]''.

In the early 1990s, the Scottish edition declared support for the pro-independence [[Scottish National Party]]. At the time the paper elsewhere continued to support the Conservatives, who were then becoming an increasingly marginalised force in Scotland.

However, the ''Scottish Sun'' had performed a U-turn by the time of the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 Scottish parliamentary election]], in which its front page featured a [[Hangman's knot|hangman's noose]] in the shape of an SNP logo, stating "Vote SNP today and you put Scotland's head in the noose".<ref>Iain McWhirter [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/03/theheatofthescottishsun "The heat of the Scottish sun"], ''The Guardian'', 3 May 2007</ref> The ''Scottish Sun'' voiced its support for the SNP in the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 parliamentary election]].<ref name=":9">{{Cite news|last=McIvor|first=Jamie|date=2011-04-19|title=Scottish election: How important is the Sun's support?|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-13128712|url-status=live|access-date=2020-11-14}}</ref>

Although it expressed some support for [[Alex Salmond]], then [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] and the SNP's leader, ''The Scottish Sun'' took a neutral stance on the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on Scottish independence]]. On 17 September, the day before the poll, an editorial commented: "What we cannot do is tell you how we think you should vote".<ref name=":11">{{cite news|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/sep/17/sun-rupert-murdoch|title=Scottish independence: Murdoch and the Sun pull back from backing yes vote|date=17 September 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>

At the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], ''The Scottish Sun'' urged its readers to back the SNP. While in England and Wales, the paper saw a vote for the Conservatives as a means to "stop [the] SNP running the country", the edition north of the border said the SNP would "fight harder for Scotland's interests at Westminster".<ref name="Withnall"/>

Following the [[Stonehaven derailment]] on 12 August 2020, the [[Independent Press Standards Organisation]] received a "high volume" of complaints about a headline in the paper, referring to the derailed train as the "Death Express".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Scottish Sun article headlined "Death Express" |url=https://www.ipso.co.uk/news-press-releases/news/scottish-sun-article-headlined-death-express/ |access-date=2020-08-14 |publisher=[[Independent Press Standards Organisation]]}}</ref> On 14 August the newspaper's editor, [[Alan Muir (journalist)|Alan Muir]], issued an apology.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Webster |first=Laura |url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/18652331.stonehaven-rail-crash-scottish-sun-sorry-distressing-front-page/ |title=Stonehaven rail crash: Scottish Sun sorry for 'distressing' front page |website=The National |date=14 August 2020 |access-date=14 August 2020 |quote="'...Wednesday was a tragic day for Scotland, an the headline on the front page of our paper in relation to the terrible train accident caused further distress... For that, I am truly sorry.'"}}</ref>

=== ''The Irish Sun'' and ''The Irish Sun on Sunday'' <span id="The Irish Sun"></span>===
The Irish edition of the newspaper, based in Dublin, is known as the ''Irish Sun'', with a regional sub-edition for [[Northern Ireland]] where it is mastheaded as ''The Sun'', based in Belfast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Ireland Sun Twitter account showing covers and mastheads|url=https://twitter.com/TheSun_NI/media|accessdate=24 April 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=December 2017}}</ref> The Republic of Ireland edition shares some content – namely glamour and showbiz – with the editions published in Great Britain, but has mainly Irish news and editorial content, as well as sport and advertising.

It often views stories in a very different light to those being reported in the UK editions. Editions of the paper in Great Britain described the film ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'' (2006) as being "designed to drag the reputation of our nation through the mud" and "the most pro-IRA ever";<ref>{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Mick|url=http://www.indymedia.ie/article/76396|title=Ken Loach hits back at British tabloids|publisher=[[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]] Ireland|date=1 June 2006}}</ref> conversely, the Republic of Ireland edition praised the film and described it as giving "the Brits a tanning".<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/greenslade/2006/06/double_standards_over_loach_mo.html|title=A classic example of newspaper spin|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 6 June 2006| accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>

''The Irish Sun'', unlike its sister papers in Great Britain, did not have a designated website until late 2012. An unaffiliated news site with the name ''Irish Sun'' has been in operation since mid-2004.<ref name="Irish Sun About Us">{{cite web|title=About Irish Sun|url=http://www.irishsun.com/about|accessdate=27 December 2013|publisher='’Irish Sun.com'’}}</ref>

There is also an Irish edition of the ''Sun on Sunday'', the ''Irish Sun on Sunday'', which launched in February 2012.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== ''Polski Sun'' ===
''Polski Sun'' was a Polish-language version of the newspaper which ran for six issues in June 2008 during the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] football tournament, on the days of and the days after Poland played matches. Each issue had a circulation of 50,000–75,000, in relation to the estimated 600,000 Poles in the United Kingdom at the time.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brook|first1=Stephen|title=The Sun's Polish edition gears up for Euro 2008 debut|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/06/sun.pressandpublishing|accessdate=20 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=6 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The Sun launches issue for Poles|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7441569.stm|accessdate=20 September 2017|work=BBC News|date=7 June 2008}}</ref>
