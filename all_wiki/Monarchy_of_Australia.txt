{{Politics of Australia sidebar}}
The '''monarchy of Australia''' refers to the institution in which a person serves as Australia's [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and [[head of state]], on a [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] basis. The Australian monarchy is a [[constitutional monarchy]], modelled on the [[Westminster system]] of [[parliamentary government]], while incorporating features unique to the [[Constitution of Australia]]. 

The present monarch is [[Elizabeth II]], [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] ''Queen of Australia'',<ref name="Titles Act 1973" /> who has [[Queen regnant|reigned]] since 6 February 1952. She is represented in Australia as a whole by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], in accordance with the Australian Constitution<ref>[[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] section 2.</ref> and [[letters patent]] from the Queen,<ref>Letters Patent Relating to the Office of Governor‑General of the Commonwealth of Australia, 21 August 1984 {{cite web|url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004Q00670 |title=Office of Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia – 21/08/1984 |accessdate=13 August 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063849/https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004Q00670 |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/content.php?id=4 Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia: Letters Patent Relating to the Office of Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220901/http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/content.php?id=4 |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/content.php?id=3 Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia: Amendment of Letters Patent] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720174642/http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/content.php?id=3 |date=20 July 2008 }}</ref> and in each of the Australian states, according to the state constitutions, by a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]], assisted by a lieutenant-governor.

Australian constitutional law provides that the monarch of the United Kingdom is also the monarch in Australia.<ref>This is the effect of covering clause 2 of {{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013Q00005|title=Commonwealth of Australia Act 1900 (UK)|website=[[Federal Register of Legislation]]}}  "The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her Majesty's heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom". The act contains the [[Constitution of Australia]].</ref> This is understood today to constitute a separate Australian monarchy, the monarch acting with regard to Australian affairs exclusively upon the advice of Australian ministers. Australia is thus one of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, sixteen independent countries that share the same person as monarch and head of state. The future of the monarchy has been a recurring topic of public discussion. As of 2020, it has been over 8 years since the monarch's last [[Royal visits to Australia|visit]], the longest period of absence of [[Elizabeth II]]'s reign.

===Title===
{{Further|List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II}}
The sovereign's Australian title is currently ''Elizabeth the Second, by the [[Divine grace|Grace of God]] Queen of Australia and Her other Realms and Territories, [[Head of the Commonwealth]]''.<ref name="Titles Act 1973"/> 
[[File:Australianstamp 1609.jpg|thumb|Postage stamp with portrait of the Queen, 1953]]

Prior to 1953, the title had simply been the same as [[Style of the British sovereign|that in the United Kingdom]]. A change in the title resulted from occasional discussion and an eventual meeting of Commonwealth representatives in London in December 1952, at which Canada's preferred format for the monarch's title was ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of [Realm] and of Her other realms and territories, Head of the Commonwealth, [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]''.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110525202820/http://www.international.gc.ca/history-histoire/100/index.aspx Documents on Canadian External Relations; Volume No. 15 – 2; Chapter 1, Part 2, Royal Style and Titles]</ref> Australia, however, wished to have the United Kingdom mentioned as well.<ref>[http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefId=3498 Documents on Canadian External Relations; Volume No. 18 – 2; Chapter 1, Part 2, Royal Style and Titles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040916215907/http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefId=3498 |date=16 September 2004 }}</ref> Thus, the resolution was a title that included the United Kingdom but, for the first time, also separately mentioned Australia and the other Commonwealth realms. The passage of a new [[Royal Style and Titles Act]] by the [[Parliament of Australia]] put these recommendations into law.<ref name="Titles Act 1953">{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|rsata1953321953285|Royal Style and Titles Act 1953}}.</ref>

It was proposed by the Cabinet headed by [[Gough Whitlam]] that the title be amended to "denote the precedence of Australia, the equality of the United Kingdom and each other sovereign nation under the Crown, and the separation of Church and State." A new Royal Titles and Styles Bill that removed specific reference to the monarch's role as Queen of the United Kingdom was passed by the federal parliament, but the Governor-General, Sir [[Paul Hasluck]], reserved Royal Assent "for Her Majesty's pleasure" (similarly to Governor-General Sir [[William McKell]]'s actions with the 1953 Royal Titles and Styles Bill). Queen Elizabeth II signed her assent at [[Government House, Canberra]], on 19 October 1973.<ref name="Titles Act 1973">{{cite web| url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-did-28.html |title=Royal Style and Titles Act 1973 (Cth)| publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy| accessdate=3 November 2015}}</ref>

===Finance===
In 2018, a trip by the Prince of Wales to the Commonwealth country of Vanuatu, escorted by Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Julie Bishop]] in between a tour of Queensland and the Northern Territory, was paid for by Australian taxpayers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/07/royal-visit-flight-costs-could-top-100000-for-australian-taxpayers|last=Davidson|first=Helen|title=Royal visit flight costs could top $100,000 for Australian taxpayers|work=The Guardian|date=7 April 2018|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>

In Oct 2011, the cost of a 10-day royal visit to Australia was put at $5.85&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2014/03/06/royal-rates-what-youll-pay-for-will-and-kates-aussie-adventure/ | title=Royal rates: What you'll pay for Will and Kate's Aussie adventure| date=6 March 2014}}</ref>

Usually, the Queen's Australian governments pay only for the costs associated with the Governor-General and [[Governors of the Australian states|state governors]] in their exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices and ceremonial occasions.

==Personification of the state==
{{Further|The Crown}}
The monarch is also the locus of [[Oath of Allegiance (Australia)|oaths of allegiance]]; many employees of the Crown are required by law to recite this oath before taking their posts, such as all members of the [[Australian Parliament|Commonwealth parliament]], all members of the state and territorial parliaments, as well as all magistrates, judges, police officers and justices of the peace. This is in [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocation]] to the sovereign's [[Coronation]] Oath, wherein he or she promises "to govern the Peoples of... Australia... according to their respective laws and customs".<ref>[http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html The Form and Order of Service that is to be performed and the Ceremonies that are to be observed in the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, on Tuesday, the second day of June 1953] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007112304/http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html |date=7 October 2016 }}. Oremus.org (11 April 1994).</ref> New appointees to the Federal Cabinet currently also swear an oath that includes allegiance to the monarch before taking their post.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/2012-2013/OathsAffirmations |title=Oaths and affirmations made by the executive and members of federal parliament since 1901 |date=3 June 2013 |publisher=Parliament of Australia |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref> However, as this oath is not written in law, it has not always been observed and depends on the form chosen by the prime minister of the time, suggested to the Governor-General. In December 2007, [[Kevin Rudd]] did not swear allegiance to the sovereign when sworn in by the Governor-General, making him the first prime minister not to do so;{{cn|date=June 2020}} however, he (like all other members of parliament) did swear allegiance to the Queen, as required by law, when sworn in by the Governor-General as newly elected parliamentarians. Similarly, the [[Oath of citizenship#Australia|Oath of Citizenship]] contained a statement of allegiance to the reigning monarch until 1994, when a pledge of allegiance to "Australia" and its [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] was introduced. The High Court found, in 2002, though, that allegiance to the Queen of Australia was the "fundamental criterion of membership" in the Australian body politic, from a constitutional, rather than statutory, point of view.<ref name=PoAlib/>

===Head of state===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II and Michael Jeffery, 2007.jpg|thumb|Governor-General [[Michael Jeffery]] and the Queen at [[Buckingham Palace]], 2007]]
{{See also|Australian head of state dispute}}
Key features of Australia's system of government include its basis on a combination of "written" and "unwritten rules", and its heads of state, comprising the Sovereign and the [[Governors of the Australian states|State Governors]], and the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]].<ref name="Australia 2013. p.12"/> The [[Constitution of Australia#Head of state|constitution]] does not mention the term "[[head of state]]". The Constitution defines the Governor-General as the monarch's representative.<ref>{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution}} s 2.  Section 2 refers to "the Queen" (at the time, [[Queen Victoria]]) and covering clause 2 requires that to be interpreted as referring eventually to whoever of her "heirs and successors" is "in the sovereignty", i.e. is the monarch, of the United Kingdom.</ref> According to the [[Australian Parliamentary Library]], Australia's head of state is the monarch, and its [[Head of government#Parliamentary heads of government|head of government]] is the prime minister, with powers limited by both law and convention for government to be carried on democratically.<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_20_-_The_Australian_system_of_government Parliament House, Info Sheet 20 The Australian system of government] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220003241/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_20_-_The_Australian_system_of_government |date=20 December 2016 }}</ref> The federal constitution provides that the monarch is part of the Parliament and is empowered to appoint the Governor-General as the monarch's representative, while the executive power of the Commonwealth which is vested in the monarch is exercisable by the Governor-General as the monarch's representative.

A review of the political situation in Australia from the 1970s to the present shows that, while the position of the monarch as head of state has not been altered, some Australians have argued in favour of changing the constitution into a form of republican government that would, they propose, be better suited to the Commonwealth of Australia than the current monarchy.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Alan Fenna|author2=Jane Robbins|author3=John Summers|title=Government Politics in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDDiBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA21|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Pearson Higher Education AU|isbn=978-1-4860-0138-5|pages=21–23}}</ref> While current official sources use the description "head of state" for the monarch, in the lead up to the [[1999 Australian republic referendum|republic referendum]] in 1999, [[David Smith (public servant)|Sir David Smith]] proposed an alternative explanation, that Australia already has a head of state in the person of the Governor-General, who since 1965 has invariably been an Australian citizen.

==Constitutional role and royal prerogative==
{{rquote|right|<small>''We have a very good system now in terms of political stability... one of the reasons why we have had this wonderful stability is because of the constitutional linkages from Crown to Governor-General to Prime Minister at the Federal level, and Crown to Governor to Premiers at the State level. There are checks and balances in the system, and that is why we never had civil wars, that is why we never had huge political upheavals except in '32 and '75.

=== Foreign affairs ===
The royal prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the Governor-General-in-Council negotiates and ratifies treaties, alliances, and international agreements.<ref>[https://www.dfat.gov.au/treaties/making/#negotiating Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Negotiating and Implementing Treaties] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231232422/https://www.dfat.gov.au/treaties/making/#negotiating |date=31 December 2014 }}</ref> As with other uses of the royal prerogative, no parliamentary approval is required.<ref>[https://www.dfat.gov.au/treaties/making/#constitution Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Treaties, the Constitution and the National Interest] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231232422/https://www.dfat.gov.au/treaties/making/#constitution |date=31 December 2014 }}</ref>

===Parliament===
The sovereign, along with the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the House of Representatives, being one of the three components of [[Parliament of Australia|parliament]], is called the ''[[Queen-in-Parliament]]''. The authority of the Crown therein is embodied in the mace (House of Representatives) and Black Rod (Senate), which both bear a crown at their apex. The monarch and viceroy do not, however, participate in the legislative process save for the granting of [[Royal Assent]] by the Governor-General. Further, the constitution outlines that the Governor-General alone is responsible for summoning, [[Legislative session|proroguing]], and [[dissolution of Parliament|dissolving]] parliament,<ref>[http://australianpolitics.com/text/5.shtml ''Australian Constitution'' section 5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211015826/http://australianpolitics.com/constitution/text/5.shtml |date=11 December 2007 }}</ref> after which the [[Writ of election|writs for a general election]] are usually [[Dropping the writ|dropped by the Prime Minister]] at [[Government House, Canberra|Government House]]. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which either the monarch or the Governor-General reads the [[Speech from the Throne]]. As the monarch and viceroy, by convention, cannot enter the House of Representatives, this, as well as the bestowing of Royal Assent, takes place in the Senate chamber; Members of Parliament are summoned to these ceremonies from the House of Representatives by the Crown's messenger, the [[Black Rod|Usher of the Black Rod]], after he knocks on the doors of the lower house that have been slammed closed on him to symbolise the barring of the monarch from the House of Representatives.

All laws in Australia, except in the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Legislative Assembly]], are enacted only with the granting of [[Royal Assent]], done by the Governor-General, relevant state governor, or [[Administrator of the Northern Territory|Administrator]] in the case of the Northern Territory (NT), with the Great Seal of Australia or the appropriate state or territory seal. Laws passed by the ACT and NT legislatures, unlike their state counterparts, are subject to the oversight of the government of Australia and can be disallowed by the Australian Parliament. The Governor-General may reserve a bill "for the Queen's pleasure"; that is withhold his consent to the bill and present it to the sovereign for her personal decision. Under the constitution, the sovereign also has the power to disallow a bill within one year of the Governor-General having granted Royal Assent.<ref>[http://australianpolitics.com/text/59.shtml Australian Constitution s 59] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211015916/http://australianpolitics.com/constitution/text/59.shtml |date=11 December 2007 }}</ref> This power, however, has never been used.

===Courts===
In the United Kingdom, the sovereign is deemed the ''fount of justice''.<ref name=ACM>[http://www.norepublic.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=181&Itemid=24 Gibbs, Harry; '&#39;The Crown and the High Court – Celebrating the 100th birthday of the High Court of Australia'&#39;; 17 October 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427073954/http://www.norepublic.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=181&Itemid=24 |date=27 April 2016 }}.

Criminal offences are legally deemed to be offences against the sovereign and proceedings for [[indictment|indictable]] offences are brought in the sovereign's name in the form of ''The Queen [or King] against [Name]'' (sometimes also referred to as ''the Crown against [Name]'').<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCATrans|386|2000|litigants=Essenberg v The Queen B55/1999 |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|39|2008|litigants=The Queen v Tang |parallelcite=(2008) 237 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> Hence, the common law holds that the sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences. Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the monarch personally are not cognisable. In international cases, as a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and under established principles of [[international law]], the Queen of Australia is not subject to suit in foreign courts without her express consent. The ''[[Pardon|prerogative of mercy]]'' lies with the monarch, and is exercised in the state jurisdictions by the governors,<ref>Section 475(1) Crimes Act 1900 (ACT); ss 474B and 474C Crimes Act 1900 and s 26 Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW); s 433A Criminal Code (Northern Territory); ss 669A, 672A Criminal Code 1899 (Queensland); s 369 Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (South Australia); ss 398, 419 Criminal Code (Tasmania); s 584 Crimes Act 1958 (Victoria); s 21 Criminal Code and Part 19 Sentencing Act 1995 (Western Australia)</ref> who may pardon offences against the Crown, either before, during, or after a trial.

In addition, the monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of courts of justice, and of their judicial authority; sessions of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], for example, are opened with the words "the High Court of Australia is now in session; God Save the Queen." In a practice dating back to colonial times, state courts traditionally display the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|arms of the sovereign in right of the United Kingdom]], except in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]] where some of these have been replaced with the state arms.

==Cultural role==

===Royal presence and duties===
{{Further|Royal visits to Australia|List of Commonwealth visits made by Queen Elizabeth II}}
Members of the Royal Family have been present in Australia since the late 1800s, on military manoeuvres, for official tours, or as the vice-regal representative of the monarch. The Queen was the first reigning monarch of Australia to set foot on Australian soil on 3 February 1954. The Queen has visited the country 16 times, usually on important milestones, anniversaries, or celebrations of [[Culture of Australia|Australian culture]], while other royals have been asked to participate in lesser occasions. In these instances, when acting at the direction of the [[Cabinet of Australia|Australian Cabinet]], they do so as monarch of Australia and members of the Royal Family, respectively, and carry out two types of duties:  official and unofficial.

Unofficial duties are performed by Royal Family members on behalf of Australian organisations of which they may be [[Patronage|patrons]], through their attendance at charity events, visiting with members of the [[Australian Defence Force]] as [[Colonel-in-Chief]], or marking certain key anniversaries. The invitation and expenses associated with these undertakings are usually borne by the associated organisation.

Apart from Australia, the Queen and other members of the Royal Family regularly perform public duties in the other 15 nations of the Commonwealth in which the Queen is sovereign. As the Crown within these countries is a legally separate entity from the Australian Crown, it is funded in these countries individually, through the ordinary legislative budgeting process.

===Symbols===
[[File:Royal Standard of Australia.svg|thumb|right|The [[Queen's Personal Australian Flag]]]]

The monarchy is currently symbolised through images of the sovereign on currency and in portraits in public buildings; on [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Australia|Australian decorations and honours]], some postage stamps and on coats of arms and other government symbols. The crown is used as a heraldic symbol in the coats of arms of the Commonwealth and the states of Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Crowns are also visible on police and military badges. The [[Queen's Birthday]] is observed as a public holiday in all states.

"[[God Save the Queen]]" is Australia's [[royal anthem]]. The "Vice-Regal Salute", played only for the Governor-General and each state governor, is the first four and last four bars of "[[Advance Australia Fair]]".

There are also hundreds of places named after Australian and British monarchs and members of the Royal Family. The states of [[Queensland]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] were named after [[Queen Victoria]]; [[Adelaide]], the capital of South Australia is named after [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]], the [[Queen consort|consort]] of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]; numerous streets, squares, parks and buildings are also named in honour of past or present members of the Royal Family.

===Religious role===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip with Canberra Anglicans 23Oct11.jpg|thumb|right|The Queen and Prince Philip attending an Anglican service in Canberra]]
Until its new constitution went into force in 1962, the [[Anglican Church of Australia]] was part of the [[Church of England]]. Its titular head was consequently the monarch, in his or her capacity as [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].<ref>"The Church of England Australia was organised on the basis that it was part of the Church of England, not merely ‘in communion with’, or ‘in connection with’, the Church of England. Thus any changes to doctrine or practice in England were to be applied in Australia, unless the local situation made the change inapplicable. […] A new national constitution was agreed in 1961 and came into force on 1 January 1962.

==Vice-regal residences==

The Governor-General's official residence is [[Government House, Canberra|Government House]], commonly known as "Yarralumla", in the city of [[Canberra]]. The Australian monarch stays there when visiting Canberra, as do visiting heads of state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralianafund.org.au/government.html|title=Government House|publisher=[[The Australiana Fund]] |accessdate=14 April 2008}}</ref> Government House is the site of most state banquets, investitures, swearing-in of ministers, and other ceremonies. Another vice-regal residence is [[Admiralty House, Sydney|Admiralty House]], in Sydney, and is used principally as a retreat for the Governor-General. The Australian states also maintain official residences for their respective governors, though the monarch or other members of the Royal Family may stay there when in the state.

The Crown has a place in the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF), which consists of the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Australian Army]], and [[Royal Australian Air Force]].

Section 68 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] says: "The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representative." In practice, however, the Governor-General does not play any part in the ADF's command structure other than following the advice of the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] in the normal form of executive government.<ref>Raspal Khosa (2004).

Members of the Royal Family have presided over military ceremonies, including Trooping the Colours, inspections of the troops, and anniversaries of key battles. When the Queen is in Canberra, she lays a wreath at the [[Australian War Memorial]].

==History==
{{main|History of monarchy in Australia}}
The development of a distinctly Australian monarchy came about through a complex set of incremental events, beginning in 1770, when Captain [[James Cook]], in the name of, and under instruction from, King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], claimed the east coast of Australia.<ref name="Buck">[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5174.asp Queen and Commonwealth: Australia: History].

After [[Queen Victoria]]'s granting of [[Royal Assent]] to the [[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] on 9 July 1900, which brought about [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, whereupon the six colonies became [[States and territories of Australia|the states of Australia]], the relationship between the state governments and the Crown remained as it was pre-1901: References in the constitution to "the Queen" meant the government of the United Kingdom (in the formation of which Australians had no say)<ref name=RAC /> and the [[Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865]]{{spaced ndash}}by which colonial laws deemed repugnant to imperial (British) law in force in the colony were rendered void and inoperative{{spaced ndash}}remained in force in both the federal and state spheres;<ref>Craig, John; ''Australian Politics: A Source Book''; second ed.; p.43</ref> and all the governors, both of the Commonwealth and the states, remained appointees of the British monarch on the advice of the British Cabinet,<ref>W.J.

In response to calls from some Dominions for a re-evaluation in their status under the Crown after their sacrifice and performance in the [[First World War]],<ref name="Blackshield" />{{rp|110}} a series of [[Imperial Conference]]s was held in London, from 1917 on, which resulted in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], which provided that the United Kingdom and the Dominions were to be considered as "autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate to one another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown." The [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927]], an Act of the [[Westminster Parliament]], was the first indication of a shift in the law, before the Imperial Conference of 1930 established that the Australian Cabinet could advise the sovereign directly on the choice of Governor-General, which ensured the independence of the office.<ref>David Smith, ''Head of State'', Macleay Press 2005, p.24</ref> The Crown was further separated amongst its dominions by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]],<ref>[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1081723 Statute of Westminster 1931 (c. 4) s. 4] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804165251/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1081723 |date=4 August 2009 }}; cf McInn, W.G.; ''A Constitutional History of Australia''; p.152</ref> and, though it was not adopted by Australia until 1942 (retroactive to 3 September 1939),<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sowaa1942379/s3.html Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 (Cth) s 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213525/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sowaa1942379/s3.html |date=3 March 2016 }} Craig, John; ''Australian Politics: A Source Book''; p.43</ref> the law's validity in the United Kingdom required its government to seek Australia's consent in allowing [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|the abdication]] of [[Edward VIII]] as the King of Australia and all the other Dominions in 1936.

The [[Curtin Government|Curtin Labor Government]] appointed [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], as Governor-General during the Second World War. Curtin hoped the appointment might influence the British to despatch men and equipment to the [[Pacific War]], and the selection of the brother of [[George VI|King George VI]] reaffirmed the important role of the Crown to the Australian nation at that time.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120708131219/http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140317b.htm?hilite=duke;of;gloucester Biography – first Duke of Gloucester – Australian Dictionary of Biography].

The sovereign did not possess a title unique to Australia until the Australian parliament enacted the Royal Styles and Titles Act in 1953,<ref name="Titles Act 1953"/> after the accession of Elizabeth to the throne, and giving her the title of ''Queen of the United Kingdom, Australia and Her other Realms and Territories''. Still, Elizabeth remained both as a queen who reigned in Australia both as Queen of Australia (in the federal jurisdiction) and Queen of the United Kingdom (in each of the states), as a result of the states not wishing to have the Statute of Westminster apply to them, believing that the ''status quo'' better protected their sovereign interests against an expansionist federal government, which left the Colonial Laws Validity Act in effect. Thus, the British government could still{{spaced ndash}}at least in theory, if not with some difficulty in practice{{spaced ndash}}legislate for the Australian states, and the [[viceroy]]s in the states were appointed by and represented the sovereign of the United Kingdom, not that of Australia;<ref>Craig; p.43</ref> as late as 1976, the British ministry advised the Queen to reject [[Colin Hannah]] as the nominee of the [[Queensland]] Cabinet for [[Governors of Queensland|governor]],<ref>Chipp, Don; ''An Individual View''; p.144</ref> and court cases from Australian states could be appealed directly to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London, thereby bypassing the Australian High Court. It was with the passage of the [[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]] in 1986, which repealed the Colonial Laws Validity Act and abolished appeals of state cases to London, that the final vestiges of the British monarchy in Australia were removed, leaving a distinct Australian monarchy for the nation. The view in the [[Republic Advisory Committee]]'s report in 1993 was that if, in 1901, Victoria, as Queen-Empress, symbolised the British Empire of which all Australians were subjects, all of the powers vested in the monarch under Australia's Constitution were now exercised on the advice of the Australian government.<ref name=RAC /> In practice, the Queen's representative in Australia, the governor-general, represented the British Government directly in 1901 and until 1936, when the first [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Australia|High Commissioner]] of the United Kingdom to Australia was appointed.

It was around the same time{{clarify|reason=Around what time?|date=January 2016}} that a discussion on the matter of Australia becoming a republic began to emerge, later culminating in the [[1999 Australian republic referendum]], which was defeated by 54.4% of the populace, despite polls showing that the majority supported becoming a republic.<ref>[http://www.newspoll.com.au/image_uploads/cgi-lib.1278.1.1101republic.pdf Newspoll polls 1995–2002], ''The Australian'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050615110920/http://www.newspoll.com.au/image_uploads/cgi-lib.1278.1.1101republic.pdf |date=15 June 2005 }}</ref> It is believed the proposed model of the republic (not having a directly elected president) was unsatisfactory to most Australians.<ref>[http://www.skwirk.com/p-c_s-14_u-117_t-319_c-1084/nsw/history/power-people-and-politics-in-the-post-war-period/people-and-power/paul-keating-republicanism Paul Keating: republicanism, People and power, Power, people and politics in the post-war period, History Year 9, NSW | Online Education Home Schooling Skwirk Australia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115130315/http://www.skwirk.com/p-c_s-14_u-117_t-319_c-1084/nsw/history/power-people-and-politics-in-the-post-war-period/people-and-power/paul-keating-republicanism |date=15 January 2016 }}.

The previous Prime Minister, [[Julia Gillard]] re-affirmed her party's platform about a possible future republic. She stated that she would like to see Australia become a republic, with an appropriate time being when there is a change in monarch. A statement unaligned to this position was recorded on 21 October 2011 at a reception in the presence of the Queen at Parliament House in Canberra when Gillard stated that the monarch is "a vital constitutional part of Australian democracy and would only ever be welcomed as a beloved and respected friend."<ref>Speech by Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, 21 October 2011, Parliament House</ref> The then Opposition Leader, [[Tony Abbott]], a former head of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy stated on 21 October 2011, "Your Majesty, while 11 prime ministers and no less than 17 opposition leaders have come and gone, for 60 years you have been a presence in our national story and given the vagaries of public life, I'm confident that this will not be the final tally of the politicians that you have outlasted."<ref>Address to a Reception for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Parliament House – Office of Tony Abbott, Leader of the Opposition, 21 October 2011</ref>
