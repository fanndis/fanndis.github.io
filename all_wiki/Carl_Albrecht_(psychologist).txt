==Life==
Albrecht belonged to a family of wealthy cotton merchants; his father was the cotton merchant [[Carl Albrecht (businessman)|Carl Albrecht]] (1875–1952) and his mother was the American-born Mary Ladson Robertson (1883–1960), who belonged to a prominent planter family from [[South Carolina]]. His father was a grandson of Baron [[Ludwig Knoop]], one of the leading industrialists of the Russian Empire in his lifetime.<ref>"Albrecht," in ''[[Deutsches Geschlechterbuch]]'', Vol. 17, 1910.</ref>

He was the father of the conductor [[George Alexander Albrecht]] and of the politician [[Ernst Albrecht (politician, born 1930)|Ernst Albrecht]], and the paternal grandfather of the designated President of the European Commission [[Ursula von der Leyen]] (née Albrecht) and the conductor [[Marc Albrecht]].<ref>''[[Deutsches Geschlechterbuch]]'' vol. 187 p. 43</ref>

Albrecht was a trained medical doctor and psychotherapist, and is known for developing a new method of [[meditation]] based on [[autogenic training]].<ref name="Peng">[[Simon Peng-Keller]]: ''Gottespassion in Versunkenheit.

Woehrer. Woehrer notes that "Albrecht's results are unique in that they derive from a pioneering methodological approach based on 'Autogenic Training', which enabled a practitioner to verbalize spontaneously what he/she is experiencing while immersed in an altered state of consciousness."<ref>{{cite book |last=Woehrer |first=Franz K. |year=2019 |title=Psychology of Mystical Consciousness |chapter=Introduction |url= |location= |publisher= Crossroad Publishing Company |page= |isbn= 9780824599546 |author-link= }}</ref>
