It was designed by [[Airbus Military]] (now [[Airbus Defence and Space]]) as a [[tactical airlift]]er with [[Strategic airlift|strategic]] capabilities to replace older transport aircraft, such as the [[Transall C-160]] and the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]].<ref>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/a400m.cfm "RAF – A400m."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430164301/http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/a400m.cfm |date=30 April 2009}} ''RAF, MOD''. Retrieved: 15 May 2010.</ref> The A400M is between the C-130 and the [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|Boeing C-17]] in size; it can carry heavier loads than the C-130 and is able to use rough landing strips. Along with the transport role, the A400M can perform [[aerial refueling]] and [[medical evacuation]] when fitted with appropriate equipment.

The A400M's [[maiden flight]], originally planned for 2008, took place on 11 December 2009 from [[Seville Airport]], Spain. Between 2009 and 2010, the A400M faced cancellation as a result of development programme delays and cost overruns; however, the customer nations chose to maintain their support for the project. A total of 174 A400M aircraft had been ordered by eight nations by July 2011. In March 2013, the A400M received [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) certification. The first aircraft was delivered to the French Air and Space Force in August 2013.

==Development==

===Origins===
The project has its origins in the Future International Military Airlifter (FIMA) group, which was established in 1982 as a [[joint venture]] between [[Aérospatiale]], [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]] (MBB) with the goal of developing a replacement for both the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] and [[Transall C-160]].<ref name="Hewson">Hewson, R. ''The Vital Guide to Military Aircraft'', 2nd ed. Airlife Press, Ltd. 2001.</ref> Varying requirements and the complications of international politics meant that progress on the initiative was slow. During 1989, Lockheed decided to withdraw from the grouping; it went on to independently develop an upgraded Hercules, the [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J Super Hercules]]. With the addition of [[Alenia Aermacchi|Alenia]] of Italy and [[EADS CASA|CASA]] of Spain, the FIMA group became [[Euroflag]].

Project management evaluated twin and quad [[turbofan]] engine configurations, a quad [[propfan]] configuration, and a quad [[turboprop]] configuration, eventually settling on the turboprop option.<ref name="DesignReq-ConceptDef">{{Cite conference |date=3 October 2018 |title=A400M aircraft: Design requirements & conceptual definition |url=https://aulaairbus.etsiae.upm.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A400M-Design-Requirements-Conceptual-Definition.pdf#page=10 |location=Madrid, Spain |pages=10–12 |given1=J.L. |surname1=López Díez |given2=J.L. |surname2=Asenjo Tornell}}</ref> Since no existing turboprop engine in the western world was powerful enough to reach the projected cruise speed of Mach 0.72, a new engine design was required.

On 1 April 2016, ADS stated it was addressing production faults affecting 14 propeller gear boxes (PGBs) produced by Italian supplier [[Avio]] Aero in early 2015. The issue, involving a [[heat treating|heat treatment]] process that weakened the ring gear, affected no other PGBs; the units involved needed changing. Airbus noted: "pending full replacement of the batch, any aircraft can continue to fly with no more than one affected propeller gear box installed and is subject to continuing inspections."  Another PGB issue involved input pinion plug cracking, which could release small metallic particles into the oil system, which is safeguarded by a magnetic sensor; only engines 1 and 3, which have propellers that rotate to the right, are affected. The [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] issued an Airworthiness Directive mandating immediate on-wing inspection, followed by replacement if evidence of damage is found.<ref>{{Cite news |date=5 April 2016 |title=Airbus A400M engine glitch seen taking weeks to fix |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-a400m-engines-idUSKCN0X22G7 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623033042/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-a400m-engines-idUSKCN0X22G7 |archive-date=23 June 2018}}</ref> On 27 April 2016, Airbus warned there may be a substantial PGB repair cost.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 April 2016 |title=Airbus Reports A400M Engine Gearbox Problems Will Cause Delays |url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/2016/04/28/airbus-reports-a400m-engine-gearbox-problems-cause-delays/83643340/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515134137/http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air%2Dspace/2016/04/28/airbus%2Dreports%2Da400m%2Dengine%2Dgearbox%2Dproblems%2Dcause%2Ddelays/83643340/ |archive-date=15 May 2016 |publisher=Defense News}}</ref> An interim PGB fix was certified in July 2016, greatly extending inspection intervals.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shalal |first=Andrea |date=9 July 2016 |title=Interim fix for A400M engine issue certified: Airbus |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airshow-britain-airbus-a400m-idUSKCN0ZP0R9 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712100402/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-airshow-britain-airbus-a400m-idUSKCN0ZP0R9 |archive-date=12 July 2016 |website=reuters.com |publisher=Reuters}}</ref>

The first flight, originally scheduled for early 2008, was postponed due to delays and financial pressures. EADS announced in January 2008 that engine issues had been responsible for the delay. The rescheduled first flight, set for July 2008, was again postponed. Civil certification under [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) CS-25 shall be followed by certification for military uses.

The Airbus A400M increases the airlift capacity and range compared with the aircraft it was originally set to replace, the older versions of the Hercules and Transall. Cargo capacity is expected to double over existing aircraft, both in payload and volume, and range is increased substantially as well. The cargo box is {{cvt|17.71|m}} long excluding ramp, {{cvt|4.00|m}} wide, and {{cvt|3.85|m}} high (or {{cvt|4.00|m}} aft of the wing).<ref name="a400about" /> The maximum payload of {{convert|37|MT|ST}} can be carried over {{cvt|2000|nmi}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ABOUT THE ATLAS (A400M) |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircraft/atlas-a400m/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406145808/https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircraft/atlas-a400m/ |archive-date=6 April 2019 |website=RAF}}</ref> The A400M operates in many configurations including [[cargo]] transport, [[troop transport]], and [[medical evacuation]].

It features a [[fly-by-wire]] flight control system with sidestick controllers and [[flight envelope protection]]. Like other Airbus aircraft, the A400M has a full [[glass cockpit]]. Most systems are loosely based on those of the [[Airbus A380|A380]], but modified for the military mission. The hydraulic system has dual 207 bar (3,000 psi) channels powering the primary and secondary flight-control actuators, landing gear, wheel brakes, cargo door and optional hose-and-drogue refueling system. As with the A380, there is no third hydraulic system. Instead, there are two electrical systems; one is a set of dual-channel electrically powered hydraulic actuators, the other an array of electrically/hydraulically powered hybrid actuators.

The pair of propellers on each wing [[Counter-rotating propellers|turn in opposite directions]], with the tips of the propellers advancing from above towards the midpoint between the two engines. This is in contrast to the overwhelming majority of multi-engine propeller driven aircraft where all propellers turn in the same direction. The counter-rotation is achieved by the use of a gearbox fitted to two of the engines, and only the propeller turns in the opposite direction; all four engines are identical and turn in the same direction. This eliminates the need to have two different "handed" engines on stock for the same aircraft, simplifying maintenance and supply costs; this configuration, dubbed ''down between engines'' (DBE), allows it to produce more lift and lessens the [[torque]] and [[prop wash]] on each wing. It also reduces [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] in the event of an outboard engine failure.<ref name="Countdown">{{Cite web |title=Focus on innovation: Down-Between-Engines (DBE) |url=http://www.a400m-countdown.com/index.php?v=2&spage=7 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501074845/http://www.a400m-countdown.com/index.php?v=2&spage=7 |archive-date=1 May 2008 |website=[[Airbus Military]]}}</ref> Because of these benefits, the vertical stabilizer can be reduced by 17 percent in size, while the size of the horizontal stabilizer can be shrunk by 8 percent.<ref name="FI20041109-UnderTheSkin">{{Cite news |date=9–15 November 2004 |title=Under the skin: Airbus Military's airlifter has several things in common with its commercial siblings, sharing dimensions and composites technology that were pioneered for airliners |volume=166 |pages=46+ |work=[[Flight International]] |issue=4959 |department=A400M: Airframe |location=Toulouse, France |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/under-the-skin/57584.article |url-status=live |url-access=limited |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200702194536/https://www.flightglobal.com/power-demands/67488.article |archive-date=2 July 2020 |issn=0015-3710 |given=Guy |surname=Norris}}</ref>

On 10 September 2015, the RAF was declared the A400M fleet leader in terms of flying hours, with 900 hours flown over 300 sorties, achieved by a fleet of four aircraft. Sqn. Ldr. Glen Willcox of the RAF's Heavy Aircraft Test Squadron confirmed that reliability levels were high for an aircraft so early in its career, and that night vision goggle trials, hot and cold soaking, noise characterization tests and the first tie-down schemes for cargo had already been completed. In March 2015, the RAF's first operational mission occurred flying cargo to [[RAF Akrotiri]], [[Cyprus]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 September 2015 |title=A400M Deliveries Create Headaches For Uk |url=http://aviationweek.com/defense/a400m-deliveries-create-headaches-uk?NL=AW-05&Issue=AW-05_20150914_AW-05_283&sfvc4enews=42&cl=article_3&utm |publisher=Aviation Week}}</ref>

In September and October 2017, A400Ms from France, Germany and the UK participated in the disaster relief operations following [[Hurricane Irma]] in the [[Caribbean]], delivering a [[Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma|Puma]] helicopter, food, water and other aid supply, and evacuating stranded people.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Vigoureux |first=Thierry |date=10 September 2017 |title=Irma : l'Airbus A400M opérationnel aux Antilles |language=fr |trans-title=Irma: Airbus A400M operative in the Antilles |work=lepoint.fr |location=Paris |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/irma-l-airbus-a400m-operationnel-aux-antilles-10-09-2017-2155742_23.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729112038/http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/irma-l-airbus-a400m-operationnel-aux-antilles-10-09-2017-2155742_23.php |archive-date=29 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Gebauer |first=Matthias |date=11 September 2017 |title=Bundeswehr startet Rettungsmission in der Karibik |language=de |trans-title=Bundeswehr starts rescue mission in the Caribbean |work=spiegel.de |location=Hamburg |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/hurrikan-irma-bundeswehr-startet-rettungsmission-in-der-karibik-a-1167175.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219042438/http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/hurrikan-irma-bundeswehr-startet-rettungsmission-in-der-karibik-a-1167175.html |archive-date=19 February 2018}}</ref>

On 24 July 2018, the German Luftwaffe used an A400M for the first time to fly 75 soldiers from [[Wunstorf]] to [[Mazar-i-Sharif]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 July 2018 |title=Lufttransportgeschwader 62: A400M der Luftwaffe fliegt erstmals nach Afghanistan |url=https://www.flugrevue.de/militaer/lufttransportgeschwader-62-a400m-der-luftwaffe-fliegt-erstmals-nach-afghanistan/ |website=www.flugrevue.de}}</ref> German Air Force Inspector Ingo Gerhartz called this a "milestone" because it was the first such mission in an active war zone and showed that the armoring kit was fully functional.<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 July 2018 |title=Bundeswehr: Erstmals Bundeswehrsoldaten mit Problemflugzeug A400M nach Afghanistan gebracht |url=https://www.welt.de/newsticker/news1/article179947420/Bundeswehr-Erstmals-Bundeswehrsoldaten-mit-Problemflugzeug-A400M-nach-Afghanistan-gebracht.html |via=www.welt.de}}</ref>

On 7 September 2018, the French Air and Space Force announced that they had logged 10,000 flying hours with their fleet of 14 A400Ms, mostly flying supply missions for [[Operation Barkhane]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=7 September 2018 |title=A400M der Armée de l'Air haben 10.000 Flugstunden erreicht |url=https://www.aerobuzz.de/militar/a400m-der-armee-de-lair-haben-10-000-flugstunden-erreicht/ |website=Aerobuzz.de}}</ref>

The German government had planned to sell the last 13 A400Ms out of its order of 53 aircraft, but failed to attract any buyers. Instead the government decided to employ them in service. During a visit to the [[Wunstorf Air Base]] on 2 January 2019, the German [[Minister of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]] [[Ursula von der Leyen]] announced that the 13 A400Ms will be used to form a multinational airlift wing. Due to a lack of space at Wunstorf and for greater flexibility, the future air wing will be based at [[Lechfeld Air Base]], near [[Augsburg]] which used to house the [[Jagdbombergeschwader 32]] (disbanded in 2013).<ref>{{Cite web |date=3 January 2019 |title=Joy in Lechfeld - The A400M is coming |url=http://www.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/luftwaffe/start/archivneu/2019/jan/!ut/p/z1/hVDLTsMwEPyaXL2bB3lwS9QCRRAeUWnjC3IT4wQZO3LdBCE-HkeVKiFRsYeRdmZ2VrtAYQtUsbEXzPZaMen6msavcRatroMK79OHmwSfqjUmZRr5uAzhBTb_WaiT8UzlCFXLoXYZydmMdQAVUKAtJ41W3M5oubK9Q2GY1YYM2lg5KwdjnEL6Fmr0FwXGp1X-d5GGWbDMMFqsiuc58J2N7PM0y5r5aKg7plrJH3WTH4lboELq3fEbudqFqQBq-Bs33JCDcXRn7bC_9NDDaZqI0FpITpT28K-JTu8tbH8ZYfi4SsvyYvy645sf90rcUg!!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/#Z7_694IG2S0M8OH70QSU07N8410U2 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104072904/http://www.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/luftwaffe/start/archivneu/2019/jan/!ut/p/z1/hVDLTsMwEPyaXL2bB3lwS9QCRRAeUWnjC3IT4wQZO3LdBCE-HkeVKiFRsYeRdmZ2VrtAYQtUsbEXzPZaMen6msavcRatroMK79OHmwSfqjUmZRr5uAzhBTb_WaiT8UzlCFXLoXYZydmMdQAVUKAtJ41W3M5oubK9Q2GY1YYM2lg5KwdjnEL6Fmr0FwXGp1X-d5GGWbDMMFqsiuc58J2N7PM0y5r5aKg7plrJH3WTH4lboELq3fEbudqFqQBq-Bs33JCDcXRn7bC_9NDDaZqI0FpITpT28K-JTu8tbH8ZYfi4SsvyYvy645sf90rcUg!!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/#Z7_694IG2S0M8OH70QSU07N8410U2 |archive-date=4 January 2019 |website=Official Luftwaffe website}}</ref>
