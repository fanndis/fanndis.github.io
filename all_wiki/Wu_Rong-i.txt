Wu was the Vice Premier in 2005–2006.<ref name="taipeitimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2005/02/19/2003223650|title=Wu Rong-i becomes vice premier - Taipei Times|publisher=taipeitimes.com|accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref>, and now serves as senior advisor to [[Tsai Ing-wen]], current [[President of Taiwan]], and as Chairman of Taiwania Capital Management Corporation, the investment arm of Taiwan.

==Education==
In 1962 and 1965, Wu received his B.A. and M.A. in Economics from the [[National Taiwan University]]. Afterward, he obtained his doctoral degree in economics from [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] in [[Belgium]].

==Work==
From 1992 to 1993, Wu served as Commissioner and Member of the [[Fair Trade Commission (Taiwan)]]. He became Director and President of the [[Taiwan Institute of Economic Research]] from 1993 until 2005, and from 2005 onwards he was Vice Premier of the [[Executive Yuan]] of Taiwan. From 2001 to 2005, Wu was President and Chairman of [[Taiwan Stock Exchange]]. He has also served as Chairman of Taiwan Brain Trust and [[Taiwan Futures Exchange]], and as Advisor to the Taiwan delegation to the [[APEC]] Ministerial and Leaders' Meetings.

==Cross-strait relations==
In October 2005, Wu said that [[Chinese reunification]] is highly unlikely to happen during his lifetime unless [[Government of China|Beijing]] uses force. However, he considers Mainland China as a big brother, and wish to take the opportunity for Taiwanese to invest in the mainland and have peaceful relation with them.<ref name="bloomberg">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aQiJop8wyVRw&refer=top_world_news|title=Taiwan&#39;s Wu Won&#39;t See Unification With China `In His Lifetime&#39;  - Bloomberg|publisher=bloomberg.com|accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref>

In early October 2013 during the cross-strait peace forum in [[Shanghai]] in which attended by officials from the [[Communist Party of China]], [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] and [[Pan-Green Coalition]], Wu proposed the idea that Taiwan and Mainland China represent an "allegiance of brotherhood".<ref name="taipeitimes2">{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2013/10/25/2003575308|title=China can only develop with peace - Taipei Times|publisher=taipeitimes.com|accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref>
