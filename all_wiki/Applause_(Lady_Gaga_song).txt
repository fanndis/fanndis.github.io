"'''Applause'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] from her third studio album, ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013). It was released as the album's [[lead single]] through [[Interscope Records]] on August 12, 2013. Written and produced by Gaga, [[DJ White Shadow]], Dino Zisis and [[Nick Monson]], additional songwriters included [[Tchami|Martin Bresso]], Nicolas Mercier, Julien Arias and [[DJ Snake|William Grigahcine]]. "Applause" was inspired by the cheering of her fans, which kept her motivated during the months she toured with the [[Born This Way Ball]] in pain, before cancelling it due to a hip injury, and pays respect to the art of performance. It is an [[electropop]], [[dance-pop]] and [[Eurodance]] song built around [[synthesizers]] and [[hi-NRG]] beats, with lyrics addressing how Gaga is dependent upon her fans' adoration and how she lives to perform.

The song received generally positive reviews from [[music critics]], who felt its chorus was catchy and favorably compared it to the material featured on Gaga's debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008). "Applause" achieved commercial success in a number of nations, topping the charts in Hungary, Lebanon, South Korea, and Spain while peaking within the top 10 in Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Scotland, the United Kingdom, and the United States as well as the top 20 in Australia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Slovakia, and Sweden. It was also certified multi-platinum in Canada, Sweden, the United States, and Venezuela.

An accompanying music video directed by fashion photography duo [[Inez and Vinoodh]] was released on August 19, 2013, and broadcast on jumbotrons across [[Times Square]]. The video received positive reviews from critics, who saw it as a profile of Gaga herself and noted references to [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] cinema and [[Andy Warhol]]. To promote the record, Gaga opened the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]] with a performance of the song in which she represented her career through several on-stage wardrobe changes. She also performed it live on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', her tours [[ArtRave: The Artpop Ball]] and the [[Joanne World Tour]], and residency shows  [[Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom]] and [[Lady Gaga Enigma|Enigma]].

A hip surgery in February 2013 caused the singer to take a six-month hiatus, during which she studied literature and music with her creative team, the Haus of Gaga. It also allowed her to review and enhance her musical direction, which she described as a meticulous "gazing process".<ref name="WWD"/> "Applause" was written and produced by Gaga and DJ White Shadow, along with [[Nick Monson]] and Dino Zisis while on the road for her [[Born This Way Ball]] tour in 2012.

<blockquote>
"I realized it was the applause of the fans that really kept me going. Because I would be ready to go onstage and just be crying hysterically not understanding even how I was feeling. I was feeling very dizzy, I had a lot of vertigo, I had pain but it's like fuck if I know what hurts the most because I'd been on tour for a year. But I didn't want to let them down and I just couldn't cancel because the thought of leaving 50,000 kids in the arena just broke my heart. So I went out every night and I played and I played and I played until I couldn't walk one night."<ref name="sirius"/>
</blockquote>

==Recording and composition==
Recording sessions for the song took place at [[Record Plant Studios]], Hollywood, California, and Platinum Sound Recording Studio, [[New York City]] by Dave Russell, with Benjamin Rice and Andrew Robertson working as assistants. Russell also did the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the track at Record Plant and at Heard It! Studios. Additional mixing was carried out by Bill Malina, with assistance from Rice and Ghazi Hourani. Rick Pearl performed the additional [[programming (music)|programming]] and Gene Grimaldi completed the [[audio mastering]] at Oasis Mastering Studios in Burbank, California.<ref name="liner"/>

During the process of picking the lead single from ''Artpop'', Gaga played numerous songs for [[Jimmy Iovine]], an executive at [[Interscope Records]]. Of the 40 songs she played for Iovine, he preferred "Applause", the last song played.

Throughout the video bursts of color are shown theatrically. As Gaga sings the line "One second I'm a Koons then suddenly the Koons is me", she is transformed into a black swan/human hybrid.<ref name="koons" /> Gaga also wears hand-shaped lingerie and a seashell bra with matching shell decoration. Near the climax, the singer features in a violet, crystal-like scene, holding a silver, leg-shaped bouquet of colorful flowers. The final chorus concludes in flashing images from various scenes of the video. and at the end, ''Artpop'' is spelled using hand gestures.
