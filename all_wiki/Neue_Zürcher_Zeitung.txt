The '''''Neue Zürcher Zeitung''''' ('''''NZZ'''''; "New Journal of Zürich") is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]], [[German language|German-language]] [[daily newspaper]], published by [[NZZ Mediengruppe]] in [[Zürich]].<ref name=ina/> The paper was founded in 1780. A 1959 book about the paper described it a having a reputation as a high-quality newspaper, as the Swiss [[newspaper of record]], and for objective and detailed reports on international affairs.<ref>Elizabeth Wiskemann, ''A great swiss newspaper: the story of the Neue Zürcher Zeitung'' (Oxford University Press, 1959)</ref>

One of the oldest newspapers still published, it originally appeared as ''Zürcher Zeitung'',<ref>{{cite book|author=Hugo Bigi|title=Journalism Education Between Market Dependence and Social Responsibility: An Examination of Trainee Journalists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojPlRFHuvoYC&pg=PA25|accessdate=13 April 2015|year=2012|publisher=Haupt Verlag AG|isbn=978-3-258-07753-6|page=25}}</ref> edited by the Swiss painter and poet [[Salomon Gessner]], on 12 January 1780,<ref name=bbc4>{{cite news|title=The press in Switzerland|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3703425.stm|accessdate=17 January 2015|work=BBC|date=17 May 2004}}</ref><ref name=arian/> and was renamed as ''Neue Zürcher Zeitung'' in 1821.

According to Peter K. Buse and Jürgen C. Doerr many prestige German language newspapers followed its example because it set "standards through an objective, in-depth treatment of subject matter, eloquent commentary, an extensive section on entertainment, and one on advertising."<ref>Peter K. Buse and Jürgen C. Doerr, eds., ''Modern Germany: And Encyclopedia of history, people, and culture, 1871–1990'' (1998) 2:786.</ref>

Aside from the switch from its [[blackletter]] typeface in 1946, the newspaper has changed little since the 1930s. Only since 2005 has it added [[color photography|color pictures]], much later than most mainstream papers. The emphasis is on international news, business, finance, and high culture. Features and lifestyle stories are kept to a minimum.

Politically, the newspaper has been positioned close to the [[Liberalism in Europe|liberal]] [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland]] since its early period.<ref name="arian">{{cite book|author=Ariane Knüsel|title=Framing China: Media Images and Political Debates in Britain, the USA and Switzerland, 1900–1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-So1iWxAjMC&pg=PT32|accessdate=13 April 2015|date=1 September 2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-6178-4|page=32}}</ref> It has a liberal<ref name=bbc4/> and [[centre-right]] orientation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/source-information/23821-neue-zuercher-zeitung|title=Neue Zuercher Zeitung|work=Press Europ}}</ref> 

The appointment of Eric Gujer as editor-in-chief in 2015 and René Scheu as head of the feature section in 2016, as well as almost half of all contributing editors leaving the newspaper between 2015 and December 2017, marked a noticeable shift to the right, according to critics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.zeit.de/2017/52/neue-zuercher-zeitung-christoph-blocher-rechtsruck|title="Neue Zürcher Zeitung": Druck von rechts|last=Daum|first=Matthias|date=2017-12-16|work=Die Zeit|access-date=2019-07-10|last2=Shaller|first2=Caspar|language=de-DE|issn=0044-2070}}</ref>
