The river forms part of the borders between [[Maryland]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], on the left descending bank and [[West Virginia]] and [[Virginia]] on the river's right descending bank. The majority of the lower Potomac River is part of Maryland. Exceptions include a small tidal portion within the District of Columbia, and the border with Virginia being delineated from "point to point" (thus various bays and shoreline indentations lie in Virginia).  Except for a small portion of its headwaters in West Virginia, the [[#North Branch Potomac River|North Branch Potomac River]] is considered part of Maryland to the low water mark on the opposite bank. The [[South Branch Potomac River]] lies completely within the state of West Virginia except for its [[headwaters]], which lie in Virginia.

The river has two sources. The source of the North Branch is at the Fairfax Stone located at the junction of [[Grant County, West Virginia|Grant]], [[Tucker County, West Virginia|Tucker]], and [[Preston County, West Virginia|Preston]] counties in [[West Virginia]]. The source of the South Branch is located near [[Hightown, Virginia|Hightown]] in northern [[Highland County, Virginia|Highland County]], Virginia. The river's two branches converge just east of [[Green Spring, West Virginia|Green Spring]] in [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], West Virginia, to form the Potomac. As it flows from its [[River source|headwaters]] down to the Chesapeake Bay, the Potomac traverses five geological provinces: the [[Appalachian Plateau]], the [[Ridge and Valley]], the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]], the [[Piedmont Plateau]], and the [[Atlantic coastal plain]].

Once the Potomac drops from the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] to the [[Coastal Plain]] at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]] at [[Little Falls (Potomac River)|Little Falls]], [[tides]] further influence the river as it passes through Washington, D.C. and beyond. [[Salinity]] in the [[#cnote PES|Potomac River Estuary]] increases thereafter with distance downstream. The [[estuary]] also widens, reaching 11 statute miles (17&nbsp;km) wide at its mouth, between Point Lookout, Maryland, and [[Smith Point Light|Smith Point]], Virginia, before flowing into the Chesapeake Bay.

Being situated in an area rich in [[American history]] and American heritage has led to the Potomac being nicknamed "the Nation's River." [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States]], was born in, surveyed, and spent most of his life within, the Potomac basin. All of Washington, D.C., the nation's [[capital city]], also lies within the watershed. The 1859 siege of [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry]] at the river's [[confluence]] with the [[Shenandoah River|Shenandoah]] was a precursor to numerous epic battles of the [[American Civil War]] in and around the Potomac and its tributaries, such as the 1861 [[Battle of Ball's Bluff]] and the 1862 [[Battle of Shepherdstown]]. [[File:Map of the Potomac River ~1862 by Sneden LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Potomac River and its environs circa 1862 by [[Robert Knox Sneden]].]]General [[Robert E. Lee]] crossed the river, thereby invading the North and threatening Washington, D.C., twice in campaigns climaxing in the battles of [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] (September 17, 1862) and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] (July 1–3, 1863). Confederate General [[Jubal Early]] crossed the river in July 1864 on his attempted raid on the nation's capital. The river not only divided the Union from the Confederacy, but also gave name to the Union's largest army, the [[Army of the Potomac]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Peck|first=Garrett|title=The Potomac River: A History and Guide|year=2012|publisher=The History Press|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=978-1-60949-600-5|page=18}}</ref>

The [[Patowmack Canal]] was intended by George Washington to connect the [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater region]] near [[Georgetown, District of Columbia|Georgetown]] with [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], Maryland. Started in 1785 on the Virginia side of the river, it was not completed until 1802. Financial troubles led to the closure of the [[canal]] in 1830. The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] operated along the banks of the Potomac in Maryland from 1831 to 1924 and also connected Cumberland to Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Chesapeake & Ohio Canal: Pathway to the Nation's Capital |last=Hahn |first=Thomas |year=1984 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=Metuchen, NJ |isbn=0-8108-1732-2 }}</ref> This allowed freight to be transported around the [[rapids]] known as the [[Great Falls of the Potomac River]], as well as many other, smaller rapids.

Washington, D.C. began using the Potomac as its principal source of [[drinking water]] with the opening of the [[Washington Aqueduct]] in 1864, using a [[water intake]] constructed at Great Falls.<ref name="Ways">Ways, Harry C.

As a result of damaging floods in 1936 and 1937,<ref name="1936Flood" /> the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] proposed the [[Potomac River basin reservoir projects]], a series of dams that were intended to regulate the river and to provide a more reliable water supply. One dam was to be built at Little Falls, just north of Washington, backing its pool up to Great Falls. Just above Great Falls, the much larger [[Seneca Dam]] was proposed whose reservoir would extend to Harpers Ferry.<ref name="ffls1">{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19631204&id=cuQPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sYsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5587,5390295| title=Potomac Dam Is Opposed By Virginians| last=Carey| first=Frank| date=December 4, 1963| publisher=Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star| access-date=2009-11-13}}</ref> Several other dams were proposed for the Potomac and its tributaries.

[[File:Potomac green water.JPG|right|thumb|[[Eutrophication]] in the Potomac River is evident from this bright green water in Washington, D.C., caused by a dense bloom of [[cyanobacteria]], April 2012]]
Beginning in the 19th century, with increasing [[mining]] and [[agriculture]] upstream and urban [[sewage]] and [[Surface runoff|runoff]] downstream, the [[water quality]] of the Potomac River deteriorated. This created conditions of severe [[eutrophication]]. It is said that President [[Abraham Lincoln]] used to escape to the highlands on summer nights to escape the river's stench. In the 1960s, with dense green [[algae|algal]] blooms covering the river's surface, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] declared the river "a national disgrace" and set in motion a long-term effort to reduce [[water pollution|pollution]] from [[sewage]] and restore the beauty and ecology of this historic river. One of significant pollution control projects at the time was the expansion of the [[Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant]], which serves Washington and several surrounding communities.<ref>District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority. Washington, DC. [http://www.dcwater.com/about/gen_overview.cfm "History of Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317131913/http://www.dcwater.com/about/gen_overview.cfm |date=March 17, 2015 }} Accessed 2010-09-28.</ref> Enactment of the 1972 [[Clean Water Act]] led to construction or expansion of additional [[sewage treatment]] plants in the Potomac watershed. Controls on [[phosphorus]], one of the principal contributors to eutrophication, were implemented in the 1980s, through sewage plant upgrades and restrictions on phosphorus in detergents.<ref name="ICPRB timeline" />

By the end of the 20th century, notable success had been achieved, as massive algal blooms vanished and recreational fishing and boating rebounded. Still, the aquatic [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] of the Potomac River and its tributaries remain vulnerable to eutrophication, [[heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s and other toxic chemicals, over-fishing, [[Alien (biology)|alien species]], and [[pathogen]]s associated with [[fecal coliform]] [[bacteria]] and [[shellfish]] diseases. In 2005 two federal agencies, the [[US Geological Survey]] and the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]], began to identify fish in the Potomac and tributaries that exhibited "intersex" characteristics, as a result of [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine disruption]] caused by some form of pollution.<ref>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

For 400 years Maryland and Virginia have disputed control of the Potomac and its North Branch, since both states' original [[colonial charter]]s grant the entire river rather than half of it as is normally the case with boundary rivers. In its first state [[constitution]] adopted in 1776, Virginia ceded its claim to the entire river but reserved free use of it, an act disputed by Maryland. Both states acceded to the 1765 [[Mount Vernon Compact]] and the 1877 Black-Jenkins Award which granted Maryland the river bank-to-bank from the low water mark on the Virginia side, while permitting Virginia full [[riparian rights]] short of obstructing navigation.

From 1957 to 1996, the [[Maryland Department of the Environment]] (MDE) routinely issued permits applied for by Virginia entities concerning use of the Potomac. However, in 1996 the MDE denied a permit submitted by the [[Fairfax County Water Authority]] to build a water intake 725 feet (220 m) offshore, citing potential harm to Maryland's interests by an increase in Virginia sprawl caused by the project. After years of failed appeals within the Maryland government's appeal processes, in 2000 Virginia took the case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which exercises original jurisdiction in cases between two states. Maryland claimed Virginia lost its riparian rights by acquiescing to MDE's permit process for 63 years (MDE began its permit process in 1933). A [[Special Master]] appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate recommended the case be settled in favor of Virginia, citing the language in the 1785 Compact and the 1877 Award. On December 9, 2003, the Court agreed in a 7–2 decision.<ref>U.S. Supreme Court. ''Virginia v. Maryland,'' {{ussc|540|56|2003}}</ref>

[[File:Land Use in the Potomac Basin.gif|thumb|left|Map of land use in the watershed]]
The original charters are silent as to which branch from the upper Potomac serves as the boundary, but this was settled by the 1785 Compact. When West Virginia [[West Virginia#Separation from Virginia|seceded]] from Virginia in 1863, the question of West Virginia's succession in title to the lands between the branches of the river was raised, as well as title to the river itself. Claims by Maryland to West Virginia land north of the South Branch (all of [[Mineral County, West Virginia|Mineral]] and [[Grant County, West Virginia|Grant]] Counties and parts of [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire]], [[Hardy County, West Virginia|Hardy]], [[Tucker County, West Virginia|Tucker]] and [[Pendleton County, West Virginia|Pendleton]] Counties) and by West Virginia to the Potomac's high-water mark were rejected by the Supreme Court in two separate decisions in 1910.<ref>''[[Maryland v.

After having been depressed for many decades, the river's population of [[American Shad]] is currently re-bounding as a result of the [[ICPRB]]'s successful "American Shad Restoration Project" that was begun in 1995. In addition to stocking the river with more than 22 million shad fry, the Project supervised construction of a fishway that was built to facilitate the passage of adults around the Little Falls Dam on the way to their traditional spawning grounds upstream.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.potomacriver.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shadfs.pdf |title=THE POTOMAC RIVER AMERICAN SHAD RESTORATION PROJECT  |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=March 2014 |website=www.potomacriver.org |publisher=[[Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin]] |access-date=February 26, 2018}}</ref>

Early European colonists who settled along the Potomac found a diversity of large and small mammals living in the dense forests nearby. [[American bison|Bison]], [[elk]], wolves ( [[Gray wolf|gray]] and [[Red wolf|red]]) and [[Cougar|panthers]] (cougars) were still present at that time, but had been hunted to extirpation by the middle of the 19th century.  Among the denizens of the Potomac's banks, [[beaver]]s and [[otter]]s met a similar fate, while small populations of [[mink]]s and [[marten]]s survived into the 20th century in some secluded areas.

There is no record of early settlers having observed marine mammals in the Potomac, but several sightings of [[Common bottlenose dolphin|Atlantic Bottle-nosed Dolphins]] (''Tursiops truncatus'') were reported during the 19th century.  In July 1844. a pod of 14 adults and young was followed up the river by men in boats as high as the [[Aqueduct Bridge (Potomac River)|Aqueduct Bridge]] (approximately the same location occupied by [[Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)|Key Bridge]] today).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mysterious Dolphins of the Potomac|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/bottlenose-dolphins-potomac-chesapeake|access-date=February 26, 2018|year=2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170930230141/http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/bottlenose-dolphins-potomac-chesapeake|archive-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref>

Since 2015, perhaps as a result of warmer temperatures, rising water levels in the Chesapeake Bay and improving water quality in the Potomac, unprecedented numbers of Atlantic Bottle-nosed Dolphins have been observed in the river.  According to Dr Janet Mann of Georgetown University's [http://www.pcdolphinproject.org Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project], more than 500 individual members of the species have been identified in the Potomac during this period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project|url=http://www.pcdolphinproject.org/research/|access-date=February 26, 2018|year=2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406105846/http://www.pcdolphinproject.org/research/|archive-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>

==The Potomac River System==
===North Branch Potomac River===
<!-- This section is linked from [[West Virginia]] -->
[[File:North Branch Potomac River Cumberland.jpg|thumb|The North Branch between [[Cumberland, Maryland]], and [[Ridgeley, West Virginia]], in 2007]]
The source of the '''North Branch Potomac River''' is at the [[Fairfax Stone]] located at the junction of [[Grant County, West Virginia|Grant]], [[Tucker County, West Virginia|Tucker]] and [[Preston County, West Virginia|Preston]] counties in West Virginia.
[[File:PR confluence of N n S Branches.jpg|thumb|left|Confluence of the North and South Branches of the Potomac River near Potomac Forks Campsite (southeast of [[Cumberland]]), [[Allegany County, Maryland]]]]
From the Fairfax Stone, the North Branch Potomac River flows {{convert|27|mi|km}} to the man-made [[Jennings Randolph Lake]], an [[Reservoir|impoundment]] designed for flood control and emergency water supply. Below the dam, the North Branch cuts a serpentine path through the eastern Allegheny Mountains. First, it flows northeast by the communities of [[Bloomington, Maryland|Bloomington]], [[Luke, Maryland|Luke]], and [[Westernport, Maryland|Westernport]] in Maryland and then on by [[Keyser, West Virginia|Keyser]], West Virginia to [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], Maryland. At Cumberland, the river turns southeast. {{convert|103|mi}} downstream from its source,<ref name=NHD/> the North Branch is joined by the South Branch between [[Green Spring, West Virginia|Green Spring]] and [[South Branch Depot, West Virginia|South Branch Depot]], West Virginia from whence it flows past [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]], Maryland and turns southeast once more on its way toward [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Chesapeake Bay]].

The following table shows the major tributaries of the North Branch Potomac River, listed in order from the source to its mouth. Numerous other tributary creeks exist.

After a river distance of {{convert|139|mi}},<ref name=NHD/> the mouth of the South Branch lies east of [[Green Spring, West Virginia|Green Spring]] in [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], West Virginia where it meets the [[North Branch Potomac River]] to form the Potomac.<ref>[http://mapserver.maptech.com/homepage/index.cfm?lat=39.52833&lon=-78.58778&scale=25000&type=1&zoom=100&bpid=MAP0060030900%2C1%2C1%2C0&latlontype=DMS&searchscope=dom&CFID=10736808&CFTOKEN=19084588 Topographic map of the confluence of the North and South branches of the Potomac River] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312000346/http://mapserver.maptech.com/homepage/index.cfm?lat=39.52833&lon=-78.58778&scale=25000&type=1&zoom=100&bpid=MAP0060030900%2C1%2C1%2C0&latlontype=DMS&searchscope=dom&CFID=10736808&CFTOKEN=19084588 |date=March 12, 2007 }}</ref>

The North Fork South Branch Potomac River, {{convert|43.6|mi}} long,<ref name=NHD/> forms just north of the Virginia/West Virginia border in [[Pendleton County, West Virginia|Pendleton County]] at the confluence of the [[Laurel Fork (North Fork South Branch Potomac River)|Laurel Fork]] and Straight Fork along Big Mountain {{convert|3881|ft|m}}. From [[Circleville, West Virginia|Circleville]], the North Fork flows northeast through Pendleton County between the Fore Knobs {{convert|2949|ft|m}} to its west and the [[River Knobs (West Virginia)|River Knobs]], 2,490 feet (759 m) to its east. At [[Seneca Rocks, West Virginia|Seneca Rocks]], the North Fork is met by [[Seneca Creek (North Fork South Branch Potomac River)|Seneca Creek]]. From Seneca Rocks, the North Fork continues to flow northeast along the western edge of North Fork Mountain 3,389 feet (1033 m) into [[Grant County, West Virginia|Grant County]]. Flowing east through North Fork Gap, the North Fork joins the South Branch Potomac at the town of [[Cabins, West Virginia|Cabins]], west of [[Petersburg, West Virginia|Petersburg]].

The South Fork South Branch Potomac River forms just north of [[U.S. Route 250]] in [[Highland County, Virginia|Highland County]], [[Virginia]] near Monterey, and flows {{convert|68.4|mi}}<ref name=NHD/> north-northeastward to the South Branch Potomac River at [[Moorefield, West Virginia|Moorefield]] in [[Hardy County, West Virginia|Hardy County]], [[West Virginia]]. From 1896 to 1929, it was named the '''Moorefield River''' by the [[Board on Geographic Names]] to avoid confusion with the South Branch.

===Notes===
* {{cnote|AQU|The diversion dam at Great Falls, often called the [[Washington Aqueduct|"Aqueduct Dam"]], was built in the 1850s by the US Army Corps of Engineers as part of the project assigned to them by Congress to supply clean water from above Great Falls to Washington, DC. Water diverted by the dam flows 12 miles through a 9-foot diameter pipeline to Dalecarlia Reservoir on the outskirts of the city where it is first allowed to settle and then filtered and purified before being distributed to consumers. Since 1927, potable water from Dalecarlia has also been provided to Arlington County and some other sections of nearby northern Virginia through three 20-inch diameter pipelines that cross the Potomac under the deck of Chain Bridge. In addition, there is nearby a 4-foot diameter conduit constructed in 1967 that traverses the Potomac beneath the riverbed which is used primarily for backup purposes.<ref>[https://archive.today/20180219231327/https://www.washingtonian.com/2007/03/01/water-water/ "Water, Water ...

* {{cnote|GHL|"Evidence of the ancient Potomac River bed can be seen in well-rounded boulders, smoothed surfaces and grooves, and beautifully formed potholes. Look for sandstone boulders along the trail, which were deposited by massive floods. The sandy soils along the river trail, with shells mixed in, are a result of sediment deposits from floods. Some of the oldest sediment deposits in the area can be found on '''Glade Hill''', between the Matildaville and Carriage Road trails. '''Glade Hill''' was once an island in the Potomac River, and the deposits found there were left before Mather Gorge formed."<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/grfa/learn/nature/geology.htm Great Falls Geology], National Park Service, April 10, 2015</ref> }}
* {{cnote|PIF|"In the Late Pennsylvanian, the rocks of the Stubblefield Falls domain of the Mather Gorge Formation moved up relative to the Sykesville Formation on the steep, west-dipping Plummers Island fault and mylonite zones (Schoenborn, 2001) within an existing Plummers Island shear zone (figs. 5, 6). Shearing formed S2 cleavage with below-closure muscovite growth and more pervasive S2 cleavage in the Sykesville Formation. By the earliest Permian, all of the rocks in the Potomac terrane had cooled through 235°C (figs. 3, 5). Apatite fission-track data indicate cooling through ~90°C to 100°C in Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time, with increasing ages to the east, suggesting kilometer-scale rotation of the Potomac terrane in the Cretaceous and (or) Tertiary, with the west side up."<ref>Michael J.

* {{cnote|BLK|"Two samples collected from the terrace dissected by Great Falls indicate that the Falls were established in their current location by 30 ky. A series of 6 samples taken from a vertical transect just below the falls, indicates that vertical incision continued a rate of 0.5 m/ky between 27 and 12 ky, increasing to nearly 1.0 m/ky during the Holocene. These data suggest that the drop over Great Falls is growing with time. A dramatic increase in outcrop weathering and soil depth 3.5 km downstream of the Falls, suggests that prior to establishment of the Great Falls knickzone, a similar feature was likely present near Black Pond. 10-Be data are not yet available for this paleo knick zone; however, a 10-Be model age >200 ky from the top of Plummers island 5 km down stream of Black Pond suggests a much older period of retreat led to the formation of the Black Pond paleo knick zone."<ref>Paul Bierman, et. al., [https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2004NE/finalprogram/abstract_69763.htm Great Falls is 30,000 Years Old], Paper No. 35-5, Session No. 35, Geomorphic Process Rates on the Passive Margin, March 26, 2004.

The Estuary meanders in a south, southeasterly direction, except for a sharp bend about halfway downriver. The Estuary has three well-defined and distinct zones. The upper zone, from Chain Bridge to Indian Head, is the tidal freshwater reach, with salinities of less than 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt). The middle reach, between Indian Head and the Route 301 Bridge at Morgantown, is the transition zone. The salinity of this zone varies from 0.5 to 7.0 ppt and is often referred to as the zone of maximum turbidity.
