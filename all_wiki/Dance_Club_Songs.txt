'''Dance Club Songs''' is a chart published weekly by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Magazine in the United States. It is a national survey of club [[disc jockey]]s to determine the most popular songs being played in [[nightclub]]s across the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/dance-club-play-songs|title=Dance Club Songs|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref> It was launched as the Disco Action Top 30 chart on August 28, 1976, and became the first chart by ''Billboard'' to document the popularity of dance music.<ref name="History 1">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Gordon|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7595895/dance-charts-greatest-of-all-time-charts-highlights|title=Greatest of All Time: 40 Years, 40 Highlights from Billboard's Dance Club Songs Chart|work=Billboard|date=December 1, 2016|access-date=April 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201144042/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7595895/dance-charts-greatest-of-all-time-charts-highlights|url-status=live|archive-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref> The first number-one song on the chart for the issue dated August 28, 1976, was "[[You Should Be Dancing]]" by the [[Bee Gees]], spending five weeks atop the chart and the group's only number-one song on the chart.<ref name="History 1"/>

==History==
Dance Club Songs has undergone several incarnations since its inception in 1974.  Originally a top-10 list of tracks that garnered the largest audience response in [[New York City]] [[discothèque]]s, the chart began on October 26, 1974 under the title ''Disco Action''.  The chart went on to feature playlists from various cities around the country from week to week. ''Billboard'' continued to run regional and city-specific charts throughout 1975 and 1976 until the issue dated August 28, 1976, when a 30-position ''National Disco Action Top 30'' premiered. It soon expanded to 40 positions, then in 1979 the chart expanded to 60 positions, then 80, and eventually reached 100 positions from September 1979 until 1981, when it was reduced back to 80.<ref name="Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|title=Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003|isbn=0-89820-156-X|publisher=Record Research|year=2004}}</ref>

During the first half of the 1980s, the chart maintained 80 slots until March 16, 1985, when the Disco charts were splintered and renamed. Two charts appeared: ''Hot Dance/Disco Club Play'', which ranked club play (50 positions), and ''[[Hot Dance Singles Sales|Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales]]'', which ranked [[12-inch single]] (or maxi-single) sales (also 50 positions, later reduced to 10 and discontinued in 2013, since replaced by the [[Dance/Electronic Digital Songs]]).

On January 26, 2013, ''Billboard'' introduced the [[Hot Dance/Electronic Songs]] chart, which tracks the 50 most popular dance and electronic songs as determined by ''Billboard'' based on digital single sales, streaming, radio airplay across all formats, and club play, with Dance Club Songs serving as the club play component to the multi-metric chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1510640/new-danceelectronic-songs-chart-launches-with-william-britney-at-no-1 |title=New Dance/Electronic Songs Chart Launches With Will.i.am & Britney at No. 1 |first=Silvio |last=Pietroluongo |website=Billboard |date=January 17, 2013 |access-date=August 28, 2020}}</ref>

On March 31, 2020, due to the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, which caused the closures of clubs, ''Billboard'' temporarily suspended the chart.<ref name="Dance Club Songs Charts Temporarily Suspended">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9347112/boxscore-dance-club-songs-charts-temporarily-suspended |title=Billboard to Temporarily Suspend Boxscore, Dance Club Songs Charts|work=Billboard|date=March 31, 2020}}</ref>

==Statistics and ''Record World'' data==
Although the disco chart began reporting popular songs in New York City nightclubs, ''Billboard'' soon expanded coverage to feature multiple charts each week which highlighted playlists in various cities such as [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Detroit]] and [[Houston]] (among others).  During this time, ''Billboard'' rival publication ''[[Record World]]'' was the first to compile a dance chart which incorporated club play on a national level.  Noted ''Billboard'' statistician [[Joel Whitburn]] has since "adopted" ''Record World''s chart data from the weeks between March 29, 1975 and August 21, 1976 into ''Billboard''s club play history.  For the sake of continuity, ''Record World''s national chart is incorporated into both Whitburn's ''Dance/Disco'' publication (via his Record Research company) as well as the 1975 and 1976 number-ones lists.<ref name="Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003"/>

With the issue dated August 28, 1976, ''Billboard'' premiered its own national chart (''National Disco Action Top 30'') and their data is used from this date forward.<ref name="Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003"/>

==Records and other achievements==
*[[Madonna]] holds the record for the most chart hits, the most top-twenty hits, the most top-ten hits<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/959516/chart-beat-wednesday-train-beyonce-kings-of-leon|title=Chart Beat Wednesday: Train, Beyonce, Kings Of Leon|work=Billboard|last=Trust|first=Gray|access-date=February 3, 2010}}</ref> and the most total weeks at number one (75 weeks).<ref name="madonna"/>
*[[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Dave Audé]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], and [[David Guetta]] are tied with 14 number-ones on the chart, the most among male artists.
*[[Rihanna]] became the first artist to earn 4 number-ones on the chart in a year (2007), a feat she repeated a record 3 additional times before becoming the first act to earn 5 number-ones in a year (2017) as well.
*[[Madonna]] scored three number-ones in a single year six times (2001, 2003, 2006, 2012, 2015, 2019), making her the first and most act to do so.
*[[Kylie Minogue]] became the first act to have two songs in the top three on March 5, 2011. Her song "[[Better than Today]]" was number-one while "[[Higher (Taio Cruz song)|Higher]]", a song by [[Taio Cruz]] on which Minogue features, was number three. On July 28, 2016, [[Rihanna]] became the second act to achieve this when her songs "[[Kiss It Better (Rihanna song)|Kiss It Better]]" and "[[Needed Me]]" were number one and three concurrently, however it made her the first act to have two songs in the top three as the lead act on both. [[David Guetta]] was the third to earn this distinction during the chart week of November 24, 2018, when "(It Happens) Sometimes", under his alias Jack Back, was number two, while his "Don't Leave Me Alone" collaboration with Anne-Marie was number three.<ref name="Kiss it Better">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Gordon|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7453641/rihanna-26th-no-1-dance-club-songs-chart-kiss-it-better|title=Rihanna Gets Her 26th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart With 'Kiss It Better'|work=Billboard|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=September 20, 2016}}</ref>
*[[Madonna]] is the only artist in the chart's history to have 2 studio albums with 5 number-one songs each topping the chart, respectively; her eighth studio album [[Music (Madonna album)|Music]] and her ninth studio album [[American Life]].
*The first [[12-inch single]] made commercially available to the public was "[[Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent]]" by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]] in 1976.<ref name="Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003"/>
*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Disco Action chart was "[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] in 1974.<ref name="Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003"/>
*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s National Disco Action Top 30 was "[[You Should Be Dancing]]" by the [[Bee Gees]] in 1976.<ref name="Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003"/>
*Until February 2020, [[Madonna]] has the record for most number-one songs in any Billboard chart with her record-extending 50 number-ones toping the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart.
*From the dance chart's inception until the week of February 16, 1991, several (or even all) songs on an [[extended play|EP]], [[album]] or 12-inch single could occupy the same position if more than one track from a release was receiving significant play in clubs (for example, Donna Summer charted several full-length albums, both [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Madonna]] have hit number one with remix albums).  Chart entries like this were especially prevalent during the [[disco]] era, where an entire side of an album would contain several songs segued together seamlessly to replicate a night of dancing in a club.  Beginning with the February 23, 1991 issue, the dance chart became "song specific," meaning only one song could occupy each position at a time.<ref name="Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003"/>
*Because of the former policy allowing multiple songs to occupy one position at the same time, there have been three instances when not only multiple songs were at number one, but the songs were performed by different artists.  In all scenarios this was due to the tracks being included in film [[soundtrack album]]s.  In 1978, four tracks from ''[[Thank God It's Friday (soundtrack)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' ([[Donna Summer]], [[Pattie Brooks]], [[Love & Kisses]], [[Sunshine (American band)|Sunshine]]); in 1980, three tracks from ''[[Fame (soundtrack)|Fame]]'' (two by [[Irene Cara]] and one by [[Linda Clifford]]); and in 1985, two songs from ''[[Beverly Hills Cop#Soundtrack|Beverly Hills Cop]]'' ([[Patti LaBelle]], [[Harold Faltermeyer]]) hit number one together.
*[[Madonna]] additionally became the first act to have scored at least one No. 1 on the Dance Club Songs chart in five separate decades since the chart's inception in 1976, having tallied 9 in the 1980s, 13 in the '90s, 18 in the 2000s, 9 in the '10s and, now, one (so far) in the '20s.
*[[The Trammps]] are the only act to replace themselves at number one (issue date June 5, 1976, "That's Where the Happy People Go" → "Disco Party").<ref name="Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003"/>
*The longest running number-ones on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart are "[[Bad Luck (Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes song)|Bad Luck]]" by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]]{{sup|2}} in 1975 and the album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' by [[Michael Jackson]].  Both entries spent eleven weeks in the top spot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/956088/ask-billboard-small-screen-big-hits|title=Ask Billboard: Small Screen, Big Hits|work=Billboard|access-date=September 24, 2010}}</ref>
*"[[One Word]]" by [[Kelly Osbourne]] made chart history on June 18, 2005 when it became the first song to simultaneously top the Hot Dance Club Songs, Hot Dance Singles Sales and Hot Dance Airplay charts.
*[[Madonna]] is also the first act ever to score as many as 50 No. 1s on any single Billboard chart, extending her record over [[George Strait]], who has earned 44 leaders on Hot Country Songs.
*[[LeAnn Rimes]] became the first [[country music]] artist to have topped both the ''Billboard'' country chart and the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Rimes, who had several remixes of her country hits reach the dance chart, achieved that distinction during the week of February 28, 2009, when the [[electronic dance music]] [[remix]]es of her 2008 single "[[What I Cannot Change]]" reached number one.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/lifestyles/trying-follow-garth%E2%80%99s-martina%E2%80%99s-footprints|title=Trying to follow in Garth's, Martina's footprints|date=January 15, 2009|access-date=August 19, 2012|work=The Nashville City Paper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514234121/http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/lifestyles/trying-follow-garth%E2%80%99s-martina%E2%80%99s-footprints|archive-date=May 14, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7701883/dance-club-songs-leann-rimes-long-live-love "LeAnn Rimes Rules Dance Club Songs With 'Long Live Love'"] from ''Billboard'' (February 22, 2017)</ref>
*[[Olivia Newton-John]] and [[Chloe Lattanzi]]'s collaboration with Dave Audé, "[[You Have to Believe]]", which reached number one in its November 21, 2015 issue, made history for Newton-John and Lattanzi, as they became the first mother-daughter duo to reach number one on this chart as well as picking up their first number ones at Dance Club Songs as well, although Newton-John had charted four times prior to this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6762259/olivia-newton-john-first-number-1-dance-club-songs-chart|title=Olivia Newton-John Logs First No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=November 12, 2015}}</ref>
*[[Sting (musician)|Sting]] has the distinction of being the only artist to reach number one twice on this chart with a song he recorded and re-recorded, as his original version of "[[Stolen Car (Take Me Dancing)]]" featuring [[Twista]] reached that position in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2004-08-14/dance-club-play-songs |title=Hot Dance Club Songs, Billboard.com, issue date August 14, 2004 |publisher=Billboard.com |date=2004-08-14 |access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref> and again in 2016 as a featured duet with [[Mylène Farmer]] for "[[Stolen Car (Mylène Farmer song)|Stolen Car]]". In both cases, they were also remixed by Dave Audé, which is another first on this chart that a remixer reached number one with a song he remixed twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6874798/sting-surprised-no-1-dance-club-songs|title=Sting 'Thrilled and Surprised' to Hit No. 1 on Dance Club Songs|work=Billboard|access-date=February 12, 2016}}</ref>
