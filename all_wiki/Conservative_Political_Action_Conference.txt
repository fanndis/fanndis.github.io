==Controversies==
{{recentism|section|date=March 2017}}
In 2014, CPAC extended an invitation to the [[American Atheists]], which was immediately withdrawn on the same day due to controversial statements by AA's president David Silverman, who declared his group was going to "enlighten conservatives" and that "the Christian right should be threatened by us."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://politicaloutcast.com/atheists-invited-uninvited-cpac/|title=Atheists Invited, Then Uninvited, to CPAC|date=February 26, 2014|newspaper=Political Outcast|access-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref>

[[Richard B. Spencer|Richard Spencer]], a figurehead of the Alt-Right and a [[alt-right|white supremacist]], entered the lobby of the Gaylord National Hotel on February 23, 2017 in an attempt to access CPAC. Organizers of the conference ejected him from the hotel as soon as his presence was discovered, citing his "repugnant [views which] ... have absolutely nothing to do with conservatism or what we do here" as cause for rejecting his admission to CPAC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/23/516867886/white-nationalist-richard-spencer-kicked-out-of-cpac|title=White Nationalist Richard Spencer Kicked Out Of CPAC|website=NPR.org}}</ref> ACU's Executive Director Dan Schneider castigated Spencer and the alt-right in a main-stage speech, calling them "garden-variety, left-wing fascists," and saying that the alt-right "despises everything [conservatives] believe in."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4680236/cpac-alt-right-left-wing-fascists-dan-schneider/|title=A Top Conservative Said the Alt-Right Are Actually 'Left-Wing Fascists'|website=Time|access-date=January 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/23/cpac-organizer-denounces-alt-right-as-left-wing-fascist-group/|title=Alt-right leader expelled from CPAC after organizer denounces 'fascist group'|first1=David|last1=Weigel|first2=John|last2=Wagner|date=February 23, 2017|publisher=|access-date=January 7, 2018|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref> Media members across the political spectrum, led by progressive journalists and opinion columnists, salvoed the intrusion as yet another attempt by hateful groups, like the alt-right, to conceal their bigotry within a legitimate philosophy. Opinion columns in The New York Times, and articles in Mother Jones and Rolling Stone voiced concern about the 2017 interview of ex-Trump Adviser Steve Bannon and ex-Trump Chief of Staff [[Reince Priebus]] with ACU Chairman [[Matt Schlapp]], advocating for the American Right to reject the tenets of the alt-right (e.g. homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, racism, etc.).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/cpac-alt-right-steve-bannon|title=Conservatives can't figure out whether to embrace or denounce the alt-right|newspaper=Mother Jones|access-date=February 25, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/cpacs-flirtation-with-the-alt-right-is-turning-awkward-w468748|title=CPAC's Flirtation With the Alt-Right Is Turning Awkward|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=February 25, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/opinion/big-tent-or-circus-tent-a-conservative-identity-crisis-in-the-trump-era.html|title=Big Tent or Circus Tent?

===Fringe groups at CPAC===
The 2010 CPAC featured co-sponsorship for the first time from the [[John Birch Society]] and [[GOProud]], a gay conservative group.

===Milo Yiannopoulos invitation===
{{main|Milo Yiannopoulos#Alleged support for paedophilia}}

In December 2016, CPAC extended an invitation to conservative blogger [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] to speak at the event, despite his history of controversial views on feminism, racial minorities, and transgender issues. The invitation was canceled when the ''Reagan Battalion'' re-posted a video of 2016 and 2015 [[YouTube]] videos<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/02/21/the-96-hours-that-brought-down-milo-yiannopoulos/|title=The 96 hours that brought down Milo Yiannopoulos|first1=Abby|last1=Ohlheiser|first2=Abby|last2=Ohlheiser|date=February 21, 2017|via=The Washington Post}}</ref> in which Yiannopoulos is heard making comments defending sexual relationships between adult men and 13-year-old boys, citing his own sexual experiences at that age with a Catholic priest.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/cpac-milo-yiannopoulos-pedophilia.html|title=CPAC Blasted for Milo Yiannopoulos Invite After Pedophilia Remarks Resurface|last=Hartmann|first=Margaret |newspaper=New York Magazine|access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref>

==Annual straw poll==
[[File:CPAC 2015 Straw Poll by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Straw poll results at the 2015 CPAC]]

The annual CPAC [[straw poll]] vote traditionally serves as a barometer for the feelings of the conservative movement. During the conference, attendees are encouraged to fill out a survey that asks questions on a variety of issues.  The questions regarding the most popular possible presidential candidates are the most widely reported. One component of CPAC is evaluating conservative candidates for president, and the straw poll serves generally to quantify conservative opinion.

Overall, Mitt Romney holds the record of winning more CPAC straw polls than any other individual, with four. Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp and Rand Paul follow with three consecutive wins each, followed by Ron Paul with two wins. Of these five, the Pauls are the only two to win more than one straw poll, yet never appear on a Republican presidential ticket in any election (although Ron Paul did receive one [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote in 2016).<ref name = "Texas Tribune">{{cite web|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2017/01/09/rogue-texas-elector-explains-decision-back-ron-pau/|title=Rogue Texas elector explains decision to back Ron Paul|author=Patrick Svitek|work=The Texas Tribune|date=January 9, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> Despite his former popularity, Romney was uninvited from CPAC in 2020 for his vote to remove the president [[impeachment trial of Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Choi|first=Matthew|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/31/romney-cpac-impeachment-110143|title=Romney not welcome at CPAC after impeachment witness vote|work=[[Politico]]|date=January 31, 2020|accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>
