==History==
{{Main|History of Delta Air Lines}}

===Early history===
Delta Air Lines' history begins with the world's first aerial crop dusting operation called [[Huff Daland Dusters]], Inc. The company was founded on March 2, 1925, in [[Macon, Georgia]] before moving to [[Monroe, Louisiana]] in summer 1925.<ref name="Founding">{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/founding|title=Founding|website=www.deltamuseum.org|access-date=October 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001235928/https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/founding|archive-date=October 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> They flew a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, designed to combat the [[boll weevil]] infestation of cotton crops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/aircraft-by-type/crop-duster/Huff-Daland-Duster|title=Huff Daland Duster, 1925-ca.1948|website=www.deltamuseum.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002171508/http://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/aircraft-by-type/crop-duster/Huff-Daland-Duster|archive-date=October 2, 2019|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref> [[Collett E.

Passenger operations began on June 17, 1929, from [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], to [[Jackson, Mississippi]], with stops at [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], [[Louisiana]].

Local banker Travis Oliver, acting as a trustee, C.E. Woolman, and other local investors purchased back the crop-dusting assets of Delta Air Service and incorporated as Delta Air Corporation on December 31, 1930.

Delta Air Corporation secured an air mail contract in 1934, and began doing business as Delta Air Lines over Mail Route 24, stretching from Fort Worth, Texas, to Charleston, South Carolina.<ref name="First Flights"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Delta: The History of an Airline|last=Lewis and Newton|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=1979|location=Athens, Ga.|pages=28–29, 43}}</ref><ref name="Founding"/> Delta moved its headquarters from [[Monroe, Louisiana]], to its current location in [[Atlanta]] in 1941.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deltamuseum.org/docs/site/brochure/headquarters_booklet_2019edits.pdf?sfvrsn=2db8be21_2|title=Historic Aerospace Site: Delta Air Lines Headquarters, Atlanta, Georgia|work=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001235958/http://www.deltamuseum.org/docs/site/brochure/headquarters_booklet_2019edits.pdf?sfvrsn=2db8be21_2|archive-date=October 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The company name officially became Delta Air Lines in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/timeline/decades/1940|title=1940s|website=www.deltamuseum.org|access-date=October 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001235925/https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/timeline/decades/1940|archive-date=October 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1946, the company commenced regularly scheduled [[freight transport]].

In 1965, Delta was the first airline to fly the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]].

===Growth and acquisitions===
By 1970, Delta had an all-jet fleet, and in 1972 it acquired [[Northeast Airlines]]. Trans-Atlantic service began in 1978 with the first nonstop flights from Atlanta to [[London]]. In 1981, Delta launched a [[frequent-flyer program]]. In 1987, it acquired [[Western Airlines]], and that same year Delta began trans-Pacific service (Atlanta-Portland, Oregon-Tokyo). In 1990, Delta was the first airline in the United States to fly [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] jets. In 1991, it acquired substantially all of [[Pan Am]]'s trans-Atlantic routes and the Pan Am Shuttle, rebranded as the [[Delta Shuttle]]. Delta was now the leading airline across the Atlantic.<ref name="journey" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/timeline/decades/1920|title=Delta Timeline|last=Delta Flight Museum|website=www.deltamuseum.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414091215/http://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/timeline/decades/1920|archive-date=April 14, 2019|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref>

* [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]] – Delta's hub for the Southeastern United States and its main gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean.

*[[Logan International Airport|Boston]] – Inherited through the merger with [[Northeast Airlines]], Boston-Logan is Delta's secondary transatlantic hub. Boston-Logan had previously been a Delta hub from the latter half of the 20th century to the early 2000s. The present Terminal A was built for Delta's sole use, but following the 2005 bankruptcy, Delta scaled back operations and leased 11 gates in the terminal. Delta subsequently regained all the Terminal A gates and began building up operations again in the mid-2010s, culminating in the reestablishing of BOS as a hub in 2019.
*[[Detroit Metropolitan Airport|Detroit]] – Inherited through the merger with [[Northwest Airlines]], Detroit serves as one of Delta's two Midwest hubs and is Delta's second-largest overall. It is the primary Asian gateway for the Eastern United States and it also provides service to many destinations in the Americas and Europe.
*[[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]] – Inherited through the merger with [[Western Airlines]], Los Angeles is Delta's secondary hub for the West Coast. Delta inherited its LAX hub from Western Airlines, but dismantled it in the mid-1990s, opting to relocate most of those aircraft to the east coast. Since then, it has re-opened the hub, offering service to select cities in Latin America, Asia, Australia, and Europe, as well as major domestic cities and West Coast regional destinations.
*[[Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis/St. Paul]] – Inherited through the merger with [[Northwest Airlines]], Minneapolis–Saint Paul serves as one of Delta's two Midwest hubs and is Delta's third-largest overall. It is the primary Canadian gateway for the airline while also including many American metropolitan destinations, a number of regional destinations in the upper Midwest as well as some select destinations in Europe and Asia.
* [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York–JFK]] –  Delta's primary transatlantic hub. Delta inherited its JFK hub from its partnership with Pan Am after Pan Am's collapse in 1991. The hub also offers service on many transcontinental "prestige routes" to west coast destinations such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.
*[[LaGuardia Airport|New York–LaGuardia]] – Delta's second New York hub. This important domestic hub was created as a result of a slot swap with the now-defunct [[US Airways]]. Delta's service at LaGuardia covers numerous East Coast U.S. cities, and a number of regional destinations in the U.S. and Canada.
*[[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]] – Inherited through the merger with [[Western Airlines]], Salt Lake City serves as Delta's hub for the Rocky Mountain region of the United States and its fourth-largest overall. Delta service covers most major U.S. destinations as well as a number of regional destinations in the U.S. with an emphasis on the Rocky Mountain region, as well as select destinations in Canada, Mexico, as well as select cities in Europe and Hawaii.
*[[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport|Seattle/Tacoma]] – Delta's primary West Coast hub. The hub serves as an international gateway to Asia for the Western United States. Delta service also includes many major U.S. destinations as well as regional destinations in the Pacific Northwest. Delta started aggressively building its presence in Seattle in 2011 and announced SEA's hub status in 2014, while notably sparking tensions with Seattle-based Alaska Airlines.<ref name="airchive.com">{{cite web |url=http://airchive.com/blog/2014/06/17/delta-launches-seattle-hong-kong/ |title=Delta Launches Seattle-Hong Kong, and Seattle Hub - June 17, 2014 |publisher=airchive.com |accessdate=June 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621061046/http://airchive.com/blog/2014/06/17/delta-launches-seattle-hong-kong/ |archive-date=June 21, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Joint ventures===
In addition to the above codeshares, Delta has also entered into joint ventures with the following airlines.

*[[Aeromexico]] – Delta owns 49% of Mexican [[flag carrier]] Aeroméxico. In 2015, Delta and Aeromexico applied for an immunized joint venture. After two years, the joint venture was approved with two conditions: both airlines had to surrender four slot pairs at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] and 24 at [[Mexico City International Airport]] to competitors (both airports have slot restrictions). The joint venture began in May 2017, at which time Aeromexico moved to Delta gates at both Kennedy and [[Los Angeles International Airport]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/aeromexico-and-delta-launch-long-sought-joint-ventur-436903/ | title=Aeromexico and Delta launch long-sought joint venture | last=Russell | first=Edward | work=[[Flightglobal]] | date=May 9, 2017 | access-date=June 17, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229184918/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/aeromexico-and-delta-launch-long-sought-joint-ventur-436903/ | archive-date=December 29, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>
* [[Air France]]/[[KLM]]/[[Alitalia]] – Delta, as successor to Northwest Airlines, has a transatlantic joint venture with [[Air France–KLM]] and Alitalia. The program coordinates trans-Atlantic operations, including ticket pricing, schedules, capacity, and revenue. On January 27, 2012, the [[European Commission]] launched an investigation into possible violations of [[competition law]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.dw.com/en/eu-launches-antitrust-probe-into-skyteam-airline-alliance/a-15699162 | title=EU launches antitrust probe into SkyTeam airline alliance | work=[[Deutsche Welle]] | date=January 27, 2012 | access-date=July 27, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721161536/https://www.dw.com/en/eu-launches-antitrust-probe-into-skyteam-airline-alliance/a-15699162 | archive-date=July 21, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>
* [[Korean Air]] – In 2016, Delta and Korean Air began to lay the groundwork for a trans-Pacific joint venture to compete against those between [[American Airlines]] and [[Japan Airlines]], and [[United Airlines]] and [[All Nippon Airways]]. Unlike other planned joint ventures, the Delta-Korean Air joint venture was quick to receive approval by both the US Department of Transportation and the Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stattimes.com/delta-korean-air-to-jointly-increase-belly-cargo-alliance-across-transpacific-air-cargo|title=Delta, Korean Air to jointly increase belly cargo alliance across trans-Pacific {{!}} Air Cargo|last=TIMES|first=The STAT TRADE|website=www.stattimes.com|access-date=April 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403173523/https://www.stattimes.com/delta-korean-air-to-jointly-increase-belly-cargo-alliance-across-transpacific-air-cargo|archive-date=April 3, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> They aim to increase belly cargo cooperation and offer benefits to its customers across one of the most comprehensive route networks in the trans-Pacific market.

{{As of|2020|10|}}, Delta operates a fleet of 760 aircraft<ref name="Planespotters-Delta" /> manufactured by [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes|Boeing]].<ref name="statsfacts" /> Delta operates the largest [[Boeing 717]], [[Boeing 757]], and [[Boeing 767]] fleets in the world, and the largest [[Airbus A330]] fleet of any US airline. Prior to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up of solely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft. Airbus aircraft from Northwest joined the fleet after the merger, and more have since been added.

Delta often seeks to acquire and utilize older aircraft, especially narrow-bodies, and it has created an extensive MRO (maintenance, repair, and overhaul) organization, called [[Delta TechOps|TechOps]], to support them. However, in early 2011, Delta began talks with Airbus, Boeing and [[Bombardier Aerospace]] to discuss replacing the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]s, [[McDonnell Douglas MD-88]]s, and older [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] and [[757-200]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/17/351072/delta-prepares-for-full-narrowbody-analysis-in-early.html |title=Delta prepares for full narrowbody analysis in early 2011 |first=Lori |last=Ranson |date=December 17, 2011 |work=Flight International |publisher=Reed Business Information |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220043430/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/17/351072/delta-prepares-for-full-narrowbody-analysis-in-early.html |archive-date=December 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2011 |quote=...Delta president Ed Bastian said: "We clearly need to get the DC-9s retired.

===In-flight entertainment===
====History====
In the 1960s, audio programming was introduced where passengers wore headphones consisting of hollow tubes piping in music. These were installed in some Delta aircraft. Some early wide-bodied aircraft, including the [[Lockheed L-1011]], [[Boeing 767-200#767-200|Boeing 767-200]], and [[767-300#767-300|Boeing 767-300]] fleet, had movies projected onto the cabin bulkhead. Also during the late 1980s and early 1990s, [[CRT display|CRT]] monitors over the aisles were added to the 757 fleet, making them the first narrowbody aircraft to feature video entertainment. The MD-90 introduced Delta's first [[In-flight entertainment|IFE system]] with [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitors in 1995, and the 777 introduced Delta's first in-seat video system in 1999, initially using the [[Rockwell Collins]] Total Entertainment System. Delta's first all-digital IFE system with AVOD (Panasonic eFX) was first introduced in 2003 on Delta's former low-cost subsidiary, Song. The Rockwell Collins IFE system on the 777s was replaced by the Panasonic eFX system in 2007, followed by the Panasonic eX2 in 2011. The Panasonic eFX and eX2 systems are trademarked by Delta as "Delta on Demand".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.delta.com/delta-brings-award-winning-flight-experience-skies-new-%E2%80%9Csky360%C2%B0-delta%E2%80%9D-new-york-city | title=Delta Brings Award-Winning In-Flight Experience from the Skies to the New "SKY360° by Delta" in New York City | publisher=Delta Air Lines | date=October 2, 2007}}</ref>

The previous seats on the [[International flight|international]] 757-200 fleet have been placed on select [[Domestic flight|domestic]] 757-200 aircraft, mainly ones flying between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland.

In 2012, Delta began replacing the overhead CRT monitors on the pre-merger Delta 757-200 fleet with new LCD monitors.<ref name="pvt">{{cite web |url=http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-skymiles/1239128-no-ptvs-regular-pmdl-752s-new-lcds-instead-2.html |title=No PTVs for regular PMDL 752s, new LCDs instead |publisher=Flyertalk.com |accessdate=April 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328191238/http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-skymiles/1239128-no-ptvs-regular-pmdl-752s-new-lcds-instead-2.html |archive-date=March 28, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> This was completed in late 2012.

The 767-400ER fleet initially featured LCDs over the aisles, but were replaced in 2009 by the Panasonic eFX AVOD system when the last of the 767-400ERs were converted from domestic to international use. CRT projectors were originally featured in economy class on [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-300s]], with the international 767-300ERs also featuring ceiling-mounted CRT displays over the aisles, which have since replaced by LCD monitors, and are now in the process of being converted to the eFX2 AVOD system.

When Delta's ex-[[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] [[ETOPS]] 757s were first delivered, they featured a system made by Sony Transcom (a former subsidiary of [[Sony]] now sold to [[Rockwell Collins]]) system that was factory installed for TWA. The system featured overhead drop-down [[LCD]] monitors similar to Delta's non-Transcon 737-800s and 757-300s. Delta replaced the Sony Transcom system with the Panasonic eFX system featuring in-seat video and AVOD at the same time as the new BusinessElite seats and slimline economy class seats were installed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.delta.com/2007/08/31/enhancing-the-entertainment-experience/#comment-122 |title=Enhancing the Entertainment Experience |author=Chris Babb |date=September 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514010347/http://blog.delta.com/2007/08/31/enhancing-the-entertainment-experience/ |archive-date=May 14, 2013 }}</ref>

=== Delta Global Staffing ===
'''Delta Global Staffing''' (DGS) was a temporary employment firm located in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Delta Global Staffing was a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, Inc. and a division of the internal company [[DAL Global Services]].

Delta Air Lines sold majority ownership of [[DAL Global Services]] to Argenbright Holdings on December 21, 2018. As part of the sale, Delta dissolved the staffing division of DGS.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.delta.com/delta-global-services-combine-argenbright-holdings-create-premier-aviation-handling-provider |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 10, 2020 |archive-date=April 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200411004453/https://news.delta.com/delta-global-services-combine-argenbright-holdings-create-premier-aviation-handling-provider |url-status=live }}</ref>

It was founded in 1995 as a provider of temporary staffing for Delta primarily in Atlanta.  DGS has since expanded to include customers and businesses outside the airline and aviation industries. DGS now supports customers in major US metropolitan areas.

Delta Global Staffing provided contract workers for short and long term assignments, VMS partnering, VOP on-site management, temp-to-hire, direct placements, and payroll services. DGS services markets such as call centers, customer services and administrative placements, IT & professional recruiting, logistics, finance & accounting, hospitality, and aviation/airline industry.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS189559+04-Sep-2008+GNW20080904 |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 10, 2020 |archive-date=October 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017145748/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS189559+04-Sep-2008+GNW20080904 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Delta introduced its current livery in 2007 as part of a re-branding after it emerged from bankruptcy. The new livery consists of four colors, while the old one (called "colors in motion") used eight. This meant the switch saved the airline money by removing one day from each aircraft's painting cycle. The airline took four years to repaint all of its aircraft into the current scheme, including aircraft inherited from Northwest Airlines.<ref name="Mouawad1"/>

===Environmental initiatives===
In 2008, Delta Air Lines was given an award from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Design for the Environment (DfE) program for their use of PreKote, a more environmentally friendly, non-hexavalent chromium surface pretreatment on its aircraft, replacing hazardous chemicals formerly used to improve paint adhesion and prevent corrosion. In addition, PreKote reduces water usage by two-thirds and reduces wastewater treatment.

PreKote is also saving money by reducing the time needed to paint each airplane. With time savings of eight to ten percent, it will save an estimated more than $1 million annually.<ref name="Delta Air Lines News Release">{{cite web|title=Delta Air Lines Accepts EPA Award for Use of Nontoxic Materials on Aircraft|url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=22|work=Delta Air Lines News Release|publisher=Delta Air Lines|accessdate=March 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929110225/http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=22|archive-date=September 29, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Deltalina===
{{Main|Deltalina}}
As part of the re-branding project, a [[safety video]] featuring a flight attendant showed up on YouTube in early 2008, getting over 1 million views and the attention of news outlets, specifically for the video's tone mixed with the serious safety message. The flight attendant, Katherine Lee, was dubbed "Deltalina" by a member of FlyerTalk for her resemblance to [[Angelina Jolie]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ajc.com/news/who-deltalina-flashback-2008/5WbYDzscytXwoDPjI91uwK/ | title=Who is Deltalina?

|While landing in heavy snowfall, Flight 1086 from Atlanta departed the left side of runway while traveling approximately {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}}, coming to rest nearly perpendicular to the runway with its nose on an embankment beside the waters of [[Flushing Bay]]. The accident resulted in damage to the aircraft's left wing (including a fuel leak<!-- from the left wing's fuel tank -->), nose landing gear well, main electronics bay, nose radome/weather radar, and undercarriage damage forward of the front doors. The aircraft's braking system and condition of the runway surface are being considered as possible causes of the incident.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Pasztor | first1=Andy | title=Delta Crash: Investigators Suspect Possible Brake Problems | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/delta-crash-investigators-suspect-possible-brake-problems-1425852167 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=March 9, 2015 | url-access=subscription | access-date=March 6, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709135222/https://www.wsj.com/articles/delta-crash-investigators-suspect-possible-brake-problems-1425852167 | archive-date=July 9, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=NTSB Issues Second Update on the Delta Flight 1086 Accident at LaGuardia| url=https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR20150309.aspx| publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]| date=March 9, 2015| access-date=March 12, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311151945/https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR20150309.aspx| archive-date=March 11, 2015| url-status=live}}</ref>

===Hijackings===
There have been over a dozen attempted hijackings that resulted in no injuries and the surrender of the often lone hijacker. These incidents are not included. The following are notable hijackings because of fatalities or success in forcing the aircraft to fly to another country:
* On February 21, 1968, a Delta DC-8 was hijacked to Havana, Cuba. This was the first successful hijacking to Cuba from the U.S. since 1961,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and was the start of multiple hijacking attempts to Cuba in the late 1960s. This coincided with the introduction of passenger screening using metal detectors in U.S. airports starting in the late 1960s.
* On July 31, 1972, [[Delta Flight 841]], a Detroit to Miami DC-8 flight, was hijacked to [[Algiers, Algeria]] by 8 hijackers. The aircraft stopped in Boston to pick up an international navigator. The flight was allowed to return with passengers to the U.S., stopping in Barcelona for refueling.<ref name="nbc">{{cite news|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=465514|title=Delta Hijacking|work=[[NBC Nightly News]]|publisher=Vanderbilt Television News Archive|date=August 1, 1972|accessdate=January 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010051353/http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=465514|archive-date=October 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19720731-0&lang=en|title=ASN Aircraft accident McDonnell Douglas DC-8 Algiers|publisher=Aviation-safety.net|accessdate=March 1, 2009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66UDVH6K1?url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19720731-0&lang=en|archive-date=March 27, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

The hijacking attempt ended when, after a standoff with police, Byck was shot twice through an aircraft porthole by a Maryland policeman, severely wounding him.
