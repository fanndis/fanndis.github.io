====Irish Catholics in the South====
In 1820 Irish-born [[John England (bishop)|John England]] became the first Catholic bishop in the mainly Protestant city of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. During the 1820s and '30s, Bishop England defended the Catholic minority against Protestant prejudices. In 1831 and 1835, he established free schools for free [[African American]] children. Inflamed by the propaganda of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], a mob raided the Charleston post office in 1835 and the next day turned its attention to England's school. England led Charleston's "Irish Volunteers" to defend the school. Soon after this, however, all schools for "free blacks" were closed in Charleston, and England acquiesced.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Joseph|last=Kelly|title=Charleston's Bishop John England and American Slavery|journal=New Hibernia Review|publisher=[[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]]|year=2001|volume=5|issue=4|pages=48–56|jstor=20557774|doi= 10.1353/nhr.2001.0063|s2cid=145550276}}</ref>

{{quote|Support for Irish Confederate soldiers from home was vital both for encouraging them to stay in the army and to highlight to native white southerners that the entire Irish community was behind the Confederacy.

Irish nationalist [[John Mitchel]] lived in Tennessee and Virginia during his exile from Ireland and was one of the South's most outspoken supporters during the American Civil War through his newspapers the ''Southern Citizen'' and the ''Richmond Enquirer''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Bryan P.|last=McGovern|title=John Mitchel: Irish Nationalist, Southern Secessionist|publisher=[[University of Tennessee Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1572336544}}</ref>

Although most began as unskilled laborers, Irish Catholics in the South achieved average or above average economic status by 1900. David T. Gleeson emphasizes how well they were accepted by society:

{{quote|Native tolerance, however, was also a very important factor in Irish integration [into Southern society].... Upper-class southerners, therefore, did not object to the Irish, because Irish immigration never threatened to overwhelm their cities or states.... The Irish were willing to take on potentially high-mortality occupations, thereby sparing valuable slave property. Some employers objected not only to the cost of Irish labor but also to the rowdiness of their foreign-born employees. Nevertheless, they recognized the importance of the Irish worker to the protection of slavery.... The Catholicism practiced by Irish immigrants was of little concern to Southern natives.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gleeson|first=David T.|title=The Irish in the South, 1815–1877|pages=192–93|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|year=2001|isbn=978-0807849682}}</ref>}}

Irish immigration had greatly increased beginning in the 1830s due to the need for unskilled labor in canal building, lumbering, and construction works in the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]].<ref name="ruckenstein195">Ruckenstein and O'Malley (2003), p. 195.</ref> The large [[Erie Canal]] project was one such example where Irishmen were many of the laborers.

In 1871, New York's [[Orange Riots]] broke out when Irish Protestants celebrated the British victory at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] by parading through Irish Catholic neighborhoods, taunting the residents who then responded with violence.  Police Superintendent James J. Kelso, a Protestant, ordered the parade cancelled as a threat to public safety. Kelso was overruled by the governor, who ordered 5000 militia to protect the marchers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Stephen Albert Rohs |title=Eccentric Nation: Irish Performance in Nineteenth-century New York City |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-VPcr2sJbcC&pg=PA153 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=2009 |page=153 |isbn=9780838641385}}</ref> The Catholics attacked but were stopped by the militia and police, who opened fire killing about 63 Catholics.<ref>{{cite book |author=Michael Allen Gordon |title=The Orange Riots: Irish Political Violence in New York City, 1870 and 1871 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOZmKrjbSxsC&pg=PA1 |year=1993 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |pages=1–2 |isbn=978-0801427541}}</ref>

==Social history in the United States==
===Religion and society===
Religion has been important to the Irish American identity in America, and continues to play a major role in their communities. Surveys conducted since the 1970s have shown consistent majorities or pluralities of those who self-identify as being of Irish ancestry in the United States as also self-identifying as Protestants.<ref name="Carroll 2006 p. 25" /><ref name="RNS 3-17-2014" /> The Protestants' ancestors arrived primarily in the colonial era, while Catholics are primarily descended from immigrants of the 19th century. Irish leaders have been prominent in the Catholic Church in the United States for over 150 years. The Irish have been leaders in the [[Presbyterian]] and [[Methodism#United States|Methodist]] traditions, as well.<ref name=carroll>{{cite journal |first=Michael P. |last=Carroll |title=How the Irish Became Protestant in America |journal=Religion and American Culture |year=2006 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=25–54 |doi=10.1525/rac.2006.16.1.25}}</ref>

Surveys in the 1990s show that of Americans who identify themselves as "Irish", 51% said they were Protestant and 36% identified as Catholic. In the South, Protestants account for 73% of those claiming Irish origins, while Catholics account for 19%. In the North, 45% of those claiming Irish origin are Catholic, while 39% are Protestant.<ref name=carroll /> Many [[African American]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s claim Irish Protestant or Scots-Irish ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scotch Irish Foodways in America: Recipes from History|author=M.M.

The first "Orange riot" on record was in 1824, in [[Abingdon Square Park|Abingdon Square]], New York, resulting from a 12 July march. Several Orangemen were arrested and found guilty of inciting the riot. According to the State prosecutor in the court record, "the Orange celebration was until then unknown in the country." The immigrants involved were admonished: "In the United States the oppressed of all nations find an asylum, and all that is asked in return is that they become law-abiding citizens. Orangemen, Ribbonmen, and United Irishmen are alike unknown. They are all entitled to protection by the laws of the country."<ref>{{cite news |title=History of the Orange Riots in New York |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 12, 1871 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1871/07/12/archives/history-of-the-orange-riots-in-newyork.html}}</ref>

The later [[Orange Riots]] of 1870 and 1871 killed nearly 70 people, and were fought out between Irish Protestant and Catholic immigrants. After this the activities of the Orange Order were banned for a time, the Order dissolved, and most members joined [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] orders.

====Catholics====
Irish priests (especially [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Franciscan]]s, [[Augustinians]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]]) came to the large cities of the East in the 1790s, and when new dioceses were erected in 1808 the [[R.

[[Saint Patrick's Battalion]] (''San Patricios'') was a group of several hundred immigrant soldiers, the majority Irish, who deserted the U.S. Army during the [[Mexican–American War]] because of ill treatment or sympathetic leanings to fellow Mexican Catholics. They joined the Mexican army.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-09-stpatrick_N.htm| title=Bagpipers honor Irish who fought for Mexico| newspaper=[[USA Today]]| date=10 March 2008| first=Chris | last=Hawley}}</ref>

In [[Boston]] between 1810 and 1840 there had been serious tensions between the bishop and the laity who wanted to control the local parishes. By 1845, the Catholic population in Boston had increased to 30,000 from around 5,000 in 1825, due to the influx of Irish immigrants. With the appointment of John B. Fitzpatrick as bishop in 1845, tensions subsided as the increasingly Irish Catholic community grew to support Fitzpatrick's assertion of the bishop's control of parish government.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Ronald D. |last=Patkus |title=Conflict in the Church and the City: The Problem of Catholic Parish Government in Boston, 1790–1865 |journal=Historical Journal of Massachusetts |year=2001 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=53–76 }}</ref>

In New York, Archbishop [[John Hughes (archbishop of New York)|John Hughes]] (1797–1864), an Irish immigrant himself, was deeply involved in "the Irish question"—[[Irish nationalism|Irish independence from British rule]]. Hughes supported [[Daniel O'Connell]]'s [[Catholic emancipation]] movement in Ireland, but rejected such radical and violent societies as the [[Young Ireland]]ers and the [[Fenian Brotherhood|National Brotherhood]]. Hughes also disapproved of American Irish radical fringe groups, urging immigrants to assimilate themselves into American life while remaining patriotic to Ireland "only individually".<ref>[[John R.

In the 1840s, Hughes crusaded for public-funded Irish Schools modeled after the successful [[Education in the Republic of Ireland|Irish public school system]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. Hughes denounced the Public School Society of New York as an extension of an Old-World struggle whose outcome was directed not by understanding of the basic problems but, rather, by mutual mistrust and violently inflamed emotions. For Irish Catholics, the motivation lay largely in memory of British oppression, while their antagonists were dominated by the English Protestant historic fear of papal interference in civil affairs. Because of the vehemence of this quarrel, the [[New York Legislature]] passed the Maclay Act in 1842, giving New York City an elective Board of Education empowered to build and supervise schools and distribute the education fund—but with the proviso that none of the money should go to schools which taught religion. Hughes responded by building an elaborate [[parochial school]] system that stretched to the college level, setting a policy followed in other large cities. Efforts to get city or state funding failed because of vehement Protestant opposition to a system that rivaled the public schools.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Joseph J. |last=McCadden |title=New York's School Crisis of 1840–1842: Its Irish Antecedents |journal=Thought |year=1966 |volume=41 |issue=163 |pages=561–588 |doi= 10.5840/thought196641444}}</ref>

In the west, Catholic Irish were having a large effect as well. The open west attracted many Irish immigrants. Many of these immigrants were Catholic. When they migrated west, they would form "little pockets" with other Irish immigrants.<ref name=":0" /> Irish Catholic communities were made in "supportive, village style neighborhoods centered around a Catholic church and called 'parishes'".<ref name=":0" /> These neighborhoods affected the overall lifestyle and atmosphere of the communities. Other ways religion played a part in these towns was the fact that many were started by Irish Catholic priests. Father Bernard Donnelly started "Town of Kansas" which would later become Kansas City. His influence over early stages Kansas City was great, and so the Catholic religion was spread to other settlers who arrived.<ref name=":0" /> While not all settlers became Catholics, a great number of the early settlers were Catholic. In other western communities, Irish priests wanted to convert the Native Americans to Catholicism.<ref name=":0" /> These Catholic Irish would contribute not only to the growth of Catholic population in America, but to the values and traditions in America.

[[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] established a network of colleges in major cities, including [[Boston College]], [[Fordham University]] in New York, and [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Fordham was founded in 1841 and attracted students from other regions of the United States, and even [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]].

It offered a rather limited intellectual curriculum, however, with the priests at Boston College prioritizing spiritual and sacramental activities over intellectual pursuits. One consequence was that [[Harvard Law School]] would not admit Boston College graduates to its law school.

Out on the frontier, the Scots-Irish Presbyterians of the [[Muskingum River|Muskingum Valley]] in [[Ohio]] established [[Muskingum College]] at [[New Concord, Ohio|New Concord]] in 1837. It was led by two clergymen, Samuel Wilson and Benjamin Waddle, who served as trustees, president, and professors during the first few years. During the 1840s and 1850s the college survived the rapid turnover of very young presidents who used the post as a stepping stone in their clerical careers, and in the late 1850s it weathered a storm of student protest.

Irish immigrants were the first immigrant group to America to build and organize Methodist churches. Many of the early Irish immigrants who did so came from a German-Irish background. [[Barbara Heck]], an Irish woman of German descent from County Limerick, Ireland, immigrated to America in 1760, with her husband, Paul. She is often considered to be the "Mother of American Methodism."<ref>{{cite book|title=In Our Own Voices: Four Centuries of American Women's Religious Writing|author1=Rosemary Skinner Keller |author2=Rosemary Radford Ruether |page=87}}</ref> Heck guided and mentored her cousin, [[Philip Embury]], who was also an "Irish Palatine" immigrant.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New York Chronology: The Ultimate Compendium of Events, People, and Anecdotes from the Dutch to the Present|author=James Trager|page=29}}</ref> Heck and Embury constructed the [[John Street Methodist Church]], which today is usually recognized as the oldest Methodist Church in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guide to New York City Landmarks|author=Matthew A.

These women made a higher wage than most by serving the middle and high-class in their own homes as nannies, cooks and cleaners. The wages for domestic service were higher than that of factory workers and they lived in the attics of upscale mansions. By 1870, forty percent of Irish women worked as domestic servants in New York City, making them over fifty percent of the service industry at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tenement.org/encyclopedia/irish_immigrants.htm|title=Lower East Side Tenement Museum|website=Tenement.org|access-date=2016-05-11|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418064830/https://tenement.org/encyclopedia/irish_immigrants.htm|archive-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>

====Language====
Down to the end of the 19th century a large number of Irish immigrants arrived speaking [[Irish language|Irish]] as their first language. This continued to be the case with immigrants from certain counties even in the 20th century. The Irish language was first mentioned as being spoken in North America in the 17th century. Large numbers of Irish emigrated to America throughout the 18th century, bringing the language with them, and it was particularly strong in [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>For the cultural and linguistic context see Ó hAnnracháin, Stiofán (ed.), 1979.

Irish speakers continued to arrive in large numbers throughout the 19th century, particularly after the Famine. There was a certain amount of literacy in Irish, as shown by the many Irish-language manuscripts which immigrants brought with them. In 1881 ''An Gaodhal'' was founded, being the first newspaper in the world to be largely in Irish. It continued to be published into the 20th century,<ref>The paper and its context are discussed by Fionnuala Uí Fhlannagáin in: Uí Fhlannagáin, Fionnuala, 1990. ''Mícheál Ó Lócháin agus An Gaodhal''.

Irish immigrants fell into three linguistic categories: [[monolingual]] [[Irish language|Irish]] speakers, [[bilingual]] speakers of both Irish and [[English language|English]], and monolingual English speakers.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bayor | first = Ronald H. |author2=Timothy J.

According to the 2000 census, the Irish language ranks 66th out of the 322 languages spoken today in the U.S., with over 25,000 speakers.

[[Daltaí na Gaeilge]], a nonprofit Irish language advocacy group based in [[Elberon, New Jersey]], estimated that about 30,000 people spoke the language in America as of 2006.

===Occupations===
{{Celts and Modern Celts sidebar}}
Before 1800, significant numbers of Irish Protestant immigrants became farmers; many headed to the frontier where land was cheap or free and it was easier to start a farm or herding operation.<ref>Williams, John Alexander. ''Appalachia: A History''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002. (pg. 41-46) {{ISBN|0-8078-5368-2}}</ref> Many Irish Protestants and Catholics alike were [[indentured servant]]s, unable to pay their own passage or sentenced to servitude.<ref>{{cite book| last=Miller| first=Kerby A.| title=Irish immigrants in the land of Canaan letters and memoirs from colonial and revolutionary America, 1675-1815| year=2003| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Oxford| isbn=9780195348224}}</ref>

After 1840, most Irish Catholic immigrants went directly to the cities, [[mill town]]s, and railroad or canal construction sites on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. In [[upstate New York]], the [[Great Lakes]] area, the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[American frontier|Far West]], many became farmers or ranchers. In the East, male Irish laborers were hired by Irish contractors to work on canals, railroads, streets, sewers and other construction projects, particularly in [[New York (state)|New York state]] and [[New England]]. The Irish men also worked in these labor positions in the mid-west. They worked to construct towns where there had been none previously. Kansas City was one such town, and eventually became an important cattle town and railroad center.<ref name=":0" /> Labor positions weren't the only occupations for Irish, though. Some moved to New England mill towns, such as [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]], [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]], [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]], and [[Milford, Massachusetts]], where owners of textile mills welcomed the new, low-wage workers. They took the jobs previously held by [[Yankee]] women known as [[Lowell girls]].<ref>Hindman, Hugh D. ''Child Labor: An American History''. [[Armonk, New York]]: M.E. Sharpe, 2002.

Large numbers of unemployed or very poor Irish Catholics lived in squalid conditions in the new city slums and tenements.<ref name="yale">{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/glc/archive/1021.htm |title=The Sanitary and Moral Condition of New York City |publisher=[[Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance and Abolition]], [[Yale University]] |access-date=2008-04-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511202930/http://www.yale.edu/glc/archive/1021.htm |archive-date=2008-05-11}}</ref>

Single, Irish immigrant women quickly assumed jobs in high demand but for very low pay. The majority of them worked in mills, factories, and private households and were considered the bottommost group in the female job hierarchy, alongside African American women. Workers considered mill work in cotton textiles and needle trades the least desirable because of the dangerous and unpleasant conditions. Factory work was primarily a worst-case scenario for widows or daughters of families already involved in the industry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diner |first=Hasia R. |title=Erin's Daughters |pages=72, 74–76}}</ref> Unlike many other immigrants, Irish women preferred domestic work because it was constantly in great demand among middle- and upper-class American households.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diner |first=Hasia R. |title=Erin's Daughters |page=84}}</ref> Although wages differed across the country, they were consistently higher than those of the other occupations available to Irish women and could often be negotiated because of the lack of competition. Also, the working conditions in well-off households were significantly better than those of factories or mills, and free room and board allowed domestic servants to save money or send it back to their families in Ireland.<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters| pages=90–93}}</ref>

Despite some of the benefits of domestic work, Irish women's job requirements were difficult and demeaning. Subject to their employers around the clock, Irish women cooked, cleaned, babysat and more. Because most servants lived in the home where they worked, they were separated from their communities. Most of all, the American stigma on domestic work suggested that Irish women were failures who had "about the same intelligence as that of an old grey-headed negro." This quote illustrates how, in a period of extreme [[Racism in the United States|racism]] towards African Americans, society similarly viewed Irish immigrants as inferior beings.<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters| page=92}}</ref>
[[File:Irish immigrants 1909.jpg|thumb|Irish immigrants in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], c. 1909]]
Although the Irish Catholics started very low on the social status scale, by 1900 they had jobs and earnings about equal on average to their neighbors. This was largely due to their ability to speak English when they arrived. The Irish were able to rise quickly within the working world, unlike non-English speaking immigrants.<ref>Funchion, Michael F. ''Ethnic Chicago. A Multicultural Portrait''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans, 1995.

After 1945, the Catholic Irish consistently ranked at the top of the social hierarchy, thanks especially to their high rate of college attendance, and due to that many Irish American men have risen to higher socio-economic table.<ref name="greeley1988">Greeley (1988), p. 1.</ref>

====Local government====
In the 19th century, jobs in local government were distributed by politicians to their supporters, and with significant strength in city hall the Irish became candidates for positions in all departments, such as  [[police department]]s, [[fire department]]s, public schools and other [[public service]]s of major cities. In 1897 New York City was formed by consolidating its five boroughs. That created 20,000 new patronage jobs. New York invested heavily in large-scale public works. This produced thousands of unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in subways, street railways, waterworks, and port facilities. Over half the Irish men employed by the city worked in utilities. Across all ethnic groups In New York City, municipal employment grew from  54,000 workers in 1900 to 148,000 in 1930.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger David Waldinger|title=Still the Promised City?: African-Americans and New Immigrants in Postindustrial New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIX2w_N2fCkC&pg=PA210|year=1999|publisher=Harvard UP|page=210|isbn=9780674000728}}</ref>  In New York City, Albany, and Jersey City, about one third of the Irish of the first and second generation had municipal jobs in 1900.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jessica Trounstine|title=Political Monopolies in American Cities: The Rise and Fall of Bosses and Reformers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRI4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|year=2008|publisher=U of Chicago Press|page=156|isbn=9780226812823}}</ref>

====Police====
By 1855, according to New York Police Commissioner [[George W. Matsell]] (1811–1877),<ref>Newton, Michael. ''The Encyclopedia of American Law Enforcement''. New York: Facts on File, 2007. (pg. 216) {{ISBN|0-8160-6290-0}}</ref> almost 17 percent of the police department's officers were Irish-born (compared to 28.2 percent of the city) in a report to the [[New York City Council|Board of Aldermen]];<ref>James Lardner, and Thomas Reppetto. ''NYPD: A City and Its Police''. (2000)</ref> of the NYPD's 1,149 men, Irish-born officers made up 304 of 431 foreign-born policemen.<ref name="Watkin"/> In the 1860s more than half of those arrested in New York City were Irish born or of Irish descent but nearly half of the city's law enforcement officers were also Irish. By the turn of the 20th century, five out of six NYPD officers were Irish born or of Irish descent. As late as the 1960s, 42% of the NYPD were Irish Americans.<ref>Richard Bessel, and Clive Emsley. ''Patterns of Provocation: Police and Public Disorder''. (2000) p. 87</ref>

Up to the 20th and early 21st century, Irish Catholics continue to be prominent in the law enforcement community, especially in the Northeastern United States. The [[Emerald Society]], an Irish American fraternal organization, was founded in 1953 by the NYPD.<ref>Ruff, Joshua and Michael Cronin. ''Images of America: New York City Police''. [[Charleston, South Carolina]]: Arcadia Publishing, 2012. (pg. 96) {{ISBN|0-7385-7636-0}}</ref> When the Boston chapter of the Emerald Society formed in 1973, half of the [[Boston Police Department|city's police officers]] became members.

====Teachers====
Towards the end of the 19th century, schoolteaching became the most desirable occupation for the second generation of female Irish immigrants. Teaching was similar to domestic work for the first generation of Irish immigrants in that it was a popular job and one that relied on a woman's decision to remain unmarried.<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters |page=96}}</ref> The disproportionate number of Irish-American Catholic women who entered the job market as teachers in the late 19th century and early 20th century from Boston to San Francisco was a beneficial result of the Irish [[National school (Ireland)|National school]] system. Irish schools prepared young single women to support themselves in a new country, which inspired them to instill the importance of education, college training, and a profession in their American-born daughters even more than in their sons. Evidence from schools in New York City illustrate the upward trend of Irish women as teachers: "as early as 1870, twenty percent of all schoolteachers were Irish women, and...by 1890 Irish females comprised two-thirds of those in the Sixth Ward schools." Irish women attained admirable reputations as schoolteachers, which enabled some to pursue professions of even higher stature.<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters| pages=97–99}}</ref>

====Nuns====
Upon arrival in the United States, many Irish women became [[nun|Catholic nuns]] and participated in the many American sisterhoods, especially those in [[St. Louis]] in Missouri, [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] in Minnesota, and [[Troy, New York|Troy]] in New York. Additionally, the women who settled in these communities were often sent back to Ireland to recruit. This kind of religious lifestyle appealed to Irish female immigrants because they outnumbered their male counterparts and the Irish cultural tendency to postpone marriage often promoted gender separation and celibacy. Furthermore, "the Catholic church, clergy, and women religious were highly respected in Ireland," making the sisterhoods particularly attractive to Irish immigrants.<ref>{{cite book| last=Coburn| first=Carol K.| title=Spirited Lives: How Nuns Shaped Catholic Culture and American Life, 1836–1920| url=https://archive.org/details/spiritedliveshow3620cobu| url-access=registration| year=1999| publisher=The University of North Carolina Press| location=Chapel Hill| pages=[https://archive.org/details/spiritedliveshow3620cobu/page/87 87–89]}}</ref> Nuns provided extensive support for Irish immigrants in large cities, especially in fields such as nursing and teaching but also through orphanages, widows' homes, and housing for young, single women in domestic work.<ref>{{cite book| last=Coburn| first=Carol K.| title=Spirited Lives| pages=210–211}}</ref> Although many Irish communities built parish schools run by nuns, the majority of Irish parents in large cities in the East enrolled their children in the public school system, where daughters or granddaughters of Irish immigrants had already established themselves as teachers.<ref>{{cite book| last=Coburn| first=Carol K.| title=Spirited Lives| pages=140–141}}</ref>

Catholics and Protestants kept their distance; intermarriage between Catholics and Protestants was uncommon, and strongly discouraged by both Protestant ministers and Catholic priests. As Dolan notes, "'Mixed marriages', as they were called, were allowed in rare cases, were warned against repeatedly, and were uncommon."<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) p. 228</ref> Rather, intermarriage was primarily with other ethnic groups who shared their religion. Irish Catholics, for example, would commonly intermarry with German Catholics or Poles in the Midwest and Italians in the Northeast.

Irish-American journalists "scoured the cultural landscape for evidence of insults directed at the Irish in America." Much of what historians know about hostility to the Irish comes from their reports in Irish and in Democratic newspapers.<ref>Mick Mulcrone,  "The Famine Irish and the Irish-American Press: Strangers in a Hostile Land." ''American Journalism'' 20#3 (2003) pp 49-72, quote p 62</ref>

While the parishes were struggling to build parochial schools, many Catholic children attended public schools. The Protestant [[King James Version]] of the Bible was widely used in public schools, but Catholics were forbidden by their church from reading or reciting from it.<ref>According to [[canon law]], Catholics were prohibited from reading Bibles published by non-Catholics. Charles Augustine, ''A Commentary on the New Code of Canon Law'' (1921) v. 6 p. 467</ref>  Many Irish children complained that Catholicism was openly mocked in the classroom. In New York City, the curriculum vividly portrayed Catholics, and specifically the Irish, as villainous.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/publicschool/innovators/hughes.html |title=John Joseph Hughes (1797-1864) |year=2001 |work=SCHOOL: The Story of American Public Education |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS.org]] |access-date=27 June 2011}}</ref> The Catholic archbishop [[John Hughes (archbishop of New York)|John Hughes]], an immigrant to America from County Tyrone, Ireland, campaigned for public funding of [[History of Catholic education in the United States|Catholic education]] in response to the bigotry. While never successful in obtaining public money for private education, the debate with the city's Protestant elite spurred by Hughes' passionate campaign paved the way for the secularization of public education nationwide. In addition, [[List of Roman Catholic universities and colleges in the United States|Catholic higher education]] expanded during this period with colleges and universities that evolved into such institutions as [[Fordham University]] and [[Boston College]] providing alternatives to Irish who were not otherwise permitted to apply to other colleges.

Prejudice against Irish Catholics in the U.S. reached a peak in the mid-1850s with the [[Know Nothing]] Movement, which tried to oust Catholics from public office. After a year or two of local success, the Know Nothing Party vanished.<ref>Dolan, ''The Irish Americans'' (2008) pp 97-98</ref> Some historians, however, maintain that actual job discrimination was minimal.<ref name="jensen"/>

In 1895, the [[Knights of Equity]] was founded, to combat discrimination against Irish Catholics in the U.S., and to assist them financially when needed.

====Stereotypes====
Irish Catholics were popular targets for stereotyping in the 19th century. According to historian George Potter, the media often stereotyped the Irish in America as being boss-controlled, violent (both among themselves and with those of other ethnic groups), voting illegally, prone to [[alcoholism]] and dependent on street gangs that were often violent or criminal. Potter quotes contemporary newspaper images:

<blockquote>You will scarcely ever find an Irishman dabbling in counterfeit money, or breaking into houses, or swindling; but if there is any fighting to be done, he is very apt to have a hand in it." Even though Pat might "'meet with a friend and for love knock him down,'" noted a [[Montreal]] paper, the fighting usually resulted from a sudden excitement, allowing there was "but little 'malice prepense' in his whole composition." The ''Catholic Telegraph'' of [[Cincinnati]] in 1853, saying that the "name of 'Irish' has become identified in the minds of many, with almost every species of outlawry," distinguished the Irish vices as "not of a deep malignant nature," arising rather from the "transient burst of undisciplined passion," like "drunk, disorderly, fighting, etc., not like robbery, cheating, swindling, counterfeiting, slandering, calumniating, blasphemy, using obscene language, &c.<ref name="potter526">Potter (1960), p. 526.</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Joseph F. Keppler - Uncle Sam's lodging-house.jpg|thumb|1882 illustration from ''Puck''  depicting Irish immigrants as troublemakers, as compared to those of other nationalities]]

The Irish had many humorists of their own, but were scathingly attacked in political cartoons, especially those in [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'']] magazine from the 1870s to 1900; it was edited by secular Germans who opposed the Catholic Irish in politics. In addition, the cartoons of [[Thomas Nast]] were especially hostile; for example, he depicted the Irish-dominated [[Tammany Hall]] machine in New York City as a ferocious tiger.<ref name="NDE">{{cite web| url = http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/irish/unit_2.html | title = Irish Famine: Racism | publisher = Nebraska Department of Education | access-date = 2008-04-14 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080331000610/http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/irish/unit_2.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-03-31}}</ref>

The stereotype of the Irish as violent drunks has lasted well beyond its high point in the mid-19th century. For example, President [[Richard Nixon]] once told advisor [[Charles Colson]] that "[t]he Irish have certain — for example, the Irish can't drink. What you always have to remember with the Irish is they get mean. Virtually every Irish I've known gets mean when he drinks. Particularly the real Irish."<ref>[[Adam Nagourney|Nagourney, Adam]] (2010-12-10) [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/us/politics/11nixon.html?_r=2&hp In Tapes, Nixon Rails About Jews and Blacks], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>

Discrimination against Irish Americans differed depending on gender. For example, Irish women were sometimes stereotyped as "reckless breeders" because some American Protestants feared high Catholic birth rates would eventually result in a Protestant minority. Many native-born Americans claimed that "their incessant childbearing [would] ensure an Irish political takeover of American cities [and that] Catholicism would become the reigning faith of the hitherto Protestant nation."<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters| page=62}}</ref> Irish men were also targeted, but in a different way than women were. The difference between the Irish female "Bridget" and the Irish male "Pat" was distinct; while she was impulsive but fairly harmless, he was "always drunk, eternally fighting, lazy, and shiftless". In contrast to the view that Irish women were shiftless, slovenly and stupid (like their male counterparts), girls were said to be "industrious, willing, cheerful, and honest—they work hard, and they are very strictly moral".<ref>{{cite web| title=Irish Immigrants in America During the 19th Century| url=http://www.kinsella.org/history/histira.htm| work=The Kinsella Homepage| access-date=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Whelehan| first=Niall| title=The Dynamiters: Irish Nationalism and Political Violence in the Wider World, 1867-1900| year=2012| location=Cambridge| pages=217–245}}</ref>

There were also [[Social Darwinian]]-inspired excuses for the discrimination of the Irish in America. Many Americans believed that since the Irish were [[Celts]] and not [[Anglo-Saxons]], they were racially inferior and deserved second-hand citizenship. The Irish being of inferior intelligence was a belief held by many Americans. This notion was held due to the fact that the Irish topped the charts demographically in terms of arrests and imprisonment. They also had more people confined to [[insane asylum]]s and [[poorhouse]]s than any other group. The racial supremacy belief that many Americans had at the time contributed significantly to Irish discrimination.<ref>{{cite book| last=Casey| first=Marion| title=Making the Irish American: History and Heritage of the Irish in the United States| year=2006| publisher=New York University Press| page=367| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5TPHakJ98cC&q=making+the+irish+american| isbn=9780814752081}}</ref>

===Contributions to American culture===

[[File:StPatrickCathedral small.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]]]]
The annual celebration of [[Saint Patrick's Day]] is a widely recognized symbol of the Irish presence in America. The largest celebration of the holiday takes place in New York, where the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade draws an average of two million people. The second-largest celebration is held in Boston. The South Boston Parade is one the nation's oldest, dating back to 1737. [[Savannah, Georgia]], also holds one of the largest parades in the United States.

Since the arrival of nearly two million Irish immigrants in the 1840s, the urban Irish police officer and firefighter have become virtual icons of American popular culture. In many large cities, the police and fire departments have been dominated by the Irish for over 100 years, even after the ethnic Irish residential populations in those cities dwindled to small minorities. Many police and fire departments maintain large and active "[[Emerald Society|Emerald Societies]]", bagpipe marching groups, or other similar units demonstrating their members' pride in their Irish heritage.

While these archetypal images are especially well known, Irish Americans have contributed to U.S. culture in a wide variety of fields: the fine and performing arts, film, literature, politics, sports, and religion. The Irish-American contribution to popular entertainment is reflected in the careers of figures such as [[James Cagney]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Walt Disney]], [[John Ford]], [[Judy Garland]],<ref>Flynn, John & Jerry Kelleher. ''Dublin Journeys in America'' pp. 150–153, High Table Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-9544694-1-0}}</ref> [[Gene Kelly]], [[Grace Kelly]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Chuck Connors]], [[Ada Rehan]], [[Jena Malone]], and [[Spencer Tracy]]. Irish-born actress [[Maureen O'Hara]],<ref>Flynn, John & Jerry Kelleher. ''Dublin Journeys in America'' pp. 148–149, High Table Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-9544694-1-0}}</ref> who became an American citizen, defined for U.S. audiences the archetypal, feisty Irish "colleen" in popular films such as ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' and ''[[The Long Gray Line]]''. More recently, the Irish-born [[Pierce Brosnan]] gained screen celebrity as [[James Bond]]. During the early years of television, popular figures with Irish roots included [[Gracie Allen]], [[Art Carney]], [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Luke Gordon]] and [[Ed Sullivan]].

Since the late days of the film industry, celluloid representations of Irish Americans have been plentiful. Famous films with Irish-American themes include social dramas such as ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]'' and ''[[The Cardinal]]'', labor epics like ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', and gangster movies such as ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'', ''[[The Friends of Eddie Coyle]]'', and ''[[The Departed]]''. Irish-American characters have been featured in popular television series such as ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'', ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'' and ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]''.

Prominent Irish-American literary figures include [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] and [[Nobel Prize]]–winning playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Jazz Age]] novelist [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], author and poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]],<ref>Arthur Hobson Quinn, 'Edgar Allan Poe: a critical biography' (1997), p. 13</ref> social realist [[James T. Farrell]], and [[Southern Gothic]] writer [[Flannery O'Connor]]. The 19th-century novelist [[Henry James]] was also of partly Irish descent. While Irish Americans have been underrepresented in the plastic arts, two well-known American painters claim Irish roots. 20th-century painter [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] was born to an Irish-American father, and 19th-century [[trompe-l'œil]] painter [[William Harnett]] emigrated from Ireland to the United States.

The Irish-American contribution to politics spans the entire ideological spectrum. Two prominent American socialists, [[Mary Harris Jones|Mary Harris "Mother" Jones]] and [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], were Irish Americans. In the 1960s, Irish-American writer [[Michael Harrington]] became an influential advocate of social welfare programs. Harrington's views profoundly influenced President [[John F. Kennedy]] and his brother, [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Meanwhile, Irish-American political writer [[William F. Buckley]] emerged as a major intellectual force in [[American conservative]] politics in the latter half of the 20th century. Buckley's magazine, ''[[National Review]]'', proved an effective advocate of successful [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates such as [[Ronald Reagan]].

Notorious Irish Americans include the legendary New Mexico outlaw [[Billy the Kid]].<ref name="wallis6">Wallis (2007), p. 6.</ref><ref name="utley2">Utley (1989), p. 2.</ref> Many historians believe he was born in New York City to Famine-era immigrants from Ireland.<ref name="wallis6" /><ref name="utley2" /> [[Mary Mallon]], also known as ''Typhoid Mary'', was an Irish immigrant, as was [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] [[Josephine Airey]], who also went by the name of "Chicago Joe" Hensley. [[New Orleans]] socialite and murderer [[Delphine LaLaurie]], whose maiden name was Macarty, was of partial paternal Irish ancestry. [[Irish Mob|Irish-American mobsters]] include, amongst others, [[Dean O'Banion]], [[Legs Diamond|Jack "Legs" Diamond]], [[James McLean (mobster)|Buddy McLean]], [[Howie Winter]] and [[Whitey Bulger]]. [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of John F. Kennedy, had an Irish-born great-grandmother by the name of Mary Tonry.<ref>Louisiana census</ref> Colorful Irish Americans also include [[Margaret Brown|Margaret Tobin]] of ''[[RMS Titanic]]'' fame, scandalous model [[Evelyn Nesbit]], dancer [[Isadora Duncan]], [[San Francisco]] madam [[Tessie Wall]], and [[Nellie Cashman]], nurse and gold prospector in the [[American West]].

The wide popularity of Celtic music has fostered the rise of Irish-American bands that draw heavily on traditional Irish themes and music. Such groups include New York City's [[Black 47]], founded in the late 1980s, blending [[punk rock]], [[rock and roll]], [[Irish music]], rap/[[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[reggae]], and [[soul music|soul]]; and the [[Dropkick Murphys]], a Celtic punk band formed in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], nearly a decade later. [[The Decemberists]], a band featuring Irish-American singer [[Colin Meloy]], released "Shankill Butchers", a song that deals with the [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster Loyalist]] [[Shankill Butchers|gang of the same name]]. The song appears on their album ''[[The Crane Wife]]''. [[Flogging Molly]], led by Dublin-born [[Dave King (Irish singer)|Dave King]], are relative newcomers building upon this new tradition.

====Sports====
Starting with the sons of the famine generation, the Irish dominated baseball and boxing, and played a major role in other sports.

=====Baseball=====
[[File:Eric Bruntlett 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] started the tradition of wearing green uniforms on St. Patrick's day.]]
The Irish dominated professional baseball in the late 19th century, making up a third or more of the players and many of the top stars and managers.  The professional teams played in northeastern cities with large Irish populations that provided a fan base, as well as training for ambitious youth.<ref>David L. Fleitz, ''The Irish in Baseball: An Early History'' (2009)</ref> Casway argues that:
{{quote|Baseball for Irish kids was a shortcut to the American dream and to self-indulgent glory and fortune. By the mid-1880s these young Irish men dominated the sport and popularized a style of play that was termed heady, daring, and spontaneous.... [[Ed Delahanty]] personified the flamboyant, exciting spectator-favorite, the Casey-at-the-bat, Irish slugger. The handsome masculine athlete who is expected to live as large as he played.<ref>Jerrold Casway, '' Ed Delahanty in the Emerald Age of Baseball'' (2004) p. x</ref>}}

Irish stars included [[Charles Comiskey]], [[Connie Mack]], [[King Kelly|Michael "King" Kelly]], [[Roger Connor]], [[Eddie Collins]], [[Roger Bresnahan]], [[Ed Walsh]] and New York Giants manager [[John McGraw]]. The large 1945 class of inductees enshrined in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in Cooperstown included nine Irish Americans.

The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] always play at home during [[Grapefruit League|spring training]] on St. Patrick's Day. The Phillies hold the distinction of being the first baseball team to wear green uniforms on St. Patricks Day. The tradition was started by Phillies pitcher [[Tug McGraw]], who dyed his uniform green the night before March 17, 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/paul_hagen/20110318_Paul_Hagen__When_Tug_McGraw_broke_the_color_barrier_with_Phillies.html|title=When Tug McGraw broke the color barrier with Phillies|publisher=Philadelphia Media Network|author=Hagen, Paul|date=2011-03-18|access-date=2017-02-14}}</ref>

=====Gaelic sports=====
The Irish brought their native games of [[Gaelic handball|handball]], [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]] to America. Along with [[camogie]], these sports are part of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]]. The [[North American GAA]] organization is still strong, with 128 clubs across its 10 divisions.<ref>[http://usgaa.org/division/western-division/ "Divisions & Clubs"], USGAA</ref>

===Sense of heritage===
[[File:Southie Mural.JPG|thumb|[[Irish Republican]] mural in [[South Boston]], Massachusetts]]
Many people of Irish descent retain a sense of their Irish heritage. Article 2 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] formally recognizes and embraces this fact: <blockquote>…the Irish Nation cherishes its special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share its cultural identity and heritage.</blockquote>
[[File:Chicago River dyed green, focus on river.jpg|thumb|The [[Chicago River]], dyed green for the 2005 [[St. Patrick's Day]] celebration]]
Irish independence from the United Kingdom encouraged the hope that descendants of Irish abroad who had retained a cultural connection and identified with Ireland would resettle there, as opposed to attracting immigrants from other cultures in other countries. One member of an Irish government of the early republic expressed his hope as follows:

<blockquote>I do not think [the [[Irish Free State]]] will afford sufficient allurements to the citizens of other States ... The children of Irish parents born abroad are sometimes more Irish than the Irish themselves, and they would come with added experience and knowledge to our country....|4=Sen. [[Patrick W.

Though not a delegate but the secretary at the Congress, [[Charles Thomson]], also Irish American, signed as well. The [[United States Constitution]] was created by [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|a convention]] of 36 delegates. Of these, at least six were of Irish ancestry. George Read and Thomas McKean had already worked on the Declaration, and were joined by [[John Rutledge]], [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]], [[Pierce Butler]], [[Daniel Carroll]], and [[Thomas Fitzsimons]].

By the 1850s, the Irish were already a major presence in the police departments of large cities. In New York City in 1855, of the city's 1,149 policemen, 305 were natives of Ireland. Within 30 years, Irish Americans in the NYPD were almost twice their proportion of the city's population.<ref name="Watkin"/> Both Boston's police and fire departments provided many Irish immigrants with their first jobs. The creation of a unified police force in Philadelphia opened the door to the Irish in that city. By 1860 in Chicago, 49 of the 107 on the police force were Irish. Chief O'Leary headed the police force in New Orleans, and Malachi Fallon was chief of police of San Francisco.<ref name="potter530">Potter (1960), p. 530</ref>

The Irish Catholic diaspora are very well-organized{{clarify|date=January 2017}} and since 1850 have produced a majority of the leaders of the U.S. Catholic Church, labor unions, the Democratic Party in larger cities, and Catholic high schools, colleges and universities.<ref>Helmreich, William B.

Many major cities have elected Irish American Catholic mayors. Indeed, [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Houston]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New York City]], [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[St. Louis]], [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], and [[San Francisco]] have all elected natives of Ireland as mayors.

The Irish Protestant vote has not been studied nearly as much. Historian Timothy J. Meagher argues that by the late 19th century, most of the Protestant Irish "turned their backs on all associations with Ireland and melted into the American Protestant mainstream." A minority insisted on a "Scotch-Irish" identity.<ref>{{cite book|author=Timothy J.

In Canada, by contrast, Irish Protestants remained a political force, with many belonging to the [[Orange Order]].<ref>James R. Miller, "Anti-Catholic Thought in Victorian Canada," ''Canadian Historical Review'' (1985) 66#4 pp 474-494.</ref> It was an anti-Catholic social organization with chapters across Canada.

The great majority of Irish Catholic politicians were Democrats, with a few exceptions before 1970 such as Connecticut Senator [[John A.

In [[New York State]] where [[fusion voting]] is practiced, Irish Americans were instrumental in the founding of the [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative party]] in opposition to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and other liberal Republicans who dominated the state GOP during the 1960s and 70s.<ref>{{cite book |first=Chris |last=McNickle |title=To Be Mayor of New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |year=1993 |page=186-187 |isbn= 9780231076364  }}</ref> The party, founded by Irish American lawyers [[J.

The voting intentions of Irish Americans and other white ethnic groups attracted attention in the 2016 US election. In the Democratic primaries, Boston's Irish were said to break strongly for [[Hillary Clinton]], whose victories in Irish-heavy Boston suburbs may have helped her narrowly carry the state over [[Bernie Sanders]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/us-election-did-the-irish-swing-massachusetts-for-hillary-clinton-1.2568212|title=US election: Did the Irish swing Massachusetts for Hillary Clinton|last=Carswell|first=Simon|date=10 March 2016|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref> A 2016 March survey by Irish Central <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/opinion/in-a-poll-of-irish-readers-donald-trump-has-the-edge-on-hillary-clinton|title=In a poll of Irish readers, Donald Trump has the edge on Hillary Clinton|last=Egan|first=Casey|date=17 March 2016|publisher=Irish Central|access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref> showed that 45% of Irish Americans nationwide supported Trump, although the majority of those in Massachusetts supported Hillary Clinton. An October poll by Buzzfeed showed that Irish respondents nationwide split nearly evenly between Trump (40%) and Clinton (39%), with large numbers either undecided or supporting other candidates (21%), and that the Irish were more supportive of Clinton than all the other West European-descended Americans including fellow Catholic [[Italian Americans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/trump-and-the-white-vote|title=Which White People Support Trump?|last=Aldhous|first=Peter |author2=Singer-Vine, Jeremy|date=9 October 2017|publisher=Buzzfeed|access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref> In early November 2016, six days before the election, another poll by IrishCentral showed Clinton ahead at 52% among Irish Americans, while Trump was at 40% and the third party candidates together had 8%; Irish respondents in Massachusetts similarly favored Clinton by majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/clinton-polling-high-with-irish-americans-as-election-2016-approaches|title=Clinton would win Irish American vote in 2016 election, our poll results show|date=2 November 2016|publisher=Irish Central|access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref> In the official 2016 election results, Irish-heavy Boston suburbs including on the South Shore witnessed swings to the left (Scituate: +19.5% D, Cohasset: +32.8% D, Milton: +26.6% D, etc.) even as the country as a whole moved right.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} This caused many of the most heavily Irish-descended communities in the country, such as [[Scituate, Massachusetts|Scituate]], to flip from split or Republican-voting to Democrat-voting by significant margins (Scituate: +18% D, Hull: +21% D, Cohasset: +24% D, Milton: +41% D).{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Despite voting against Trump, many of these same communities had some of the highest levels of opposition to the legalization of marijuana, a typically [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] position.

In 2017, a survey with 3,181 Irish American respondents (slightly over half being beyond 3rd generation) by Irish Times found that 41% identified as Democrats while 23% identified as Republicans, while 45% used [[NBC]] (typically considered left-leaning) for their news while 36% used [[Fox News]] (considered right-leaning).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/how-irish-america-thinks-votes-and-acts-1.3104336|title=How Irish America thinks, votes and acts|author=Liam Kennedy|date=3 June 2017|agency=The Irish Times|access-date=11 February 2018}}</ref>
