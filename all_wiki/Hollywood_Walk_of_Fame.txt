The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement in the [[entertainment industry]], bearing the names of a mix of musicians, actors, directors, producers, musical and theatrical groups, fictional characters, and others. The Walk of Fame is administered by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and maintained by the self-financing Hollywood Historic Trust. It is a popular tourist destination, with an estimated 10 million annual visitors in 2010.<ref name="Martin1"/> The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce holds trademark rights to the Hollywood Walk of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://walkoffame.com/pages/licensing|title=Licensing for the Walk of Fame {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=walkoffame.com|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>

== Description ==
The Walk of Fame runs {{convert|1.3|mi|km}} east to west on Hollywood Boulevard, from Gower Street to the ''Hollywood and La Brea Gateway'' at [[La Brea Avenue]], plus a short segment on Marshfield Way that runs diagonally between Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea; and {{convert|0.4|mi|km}} north to south on Vine Street between Yucca Street and [[Sunset Boulevard]]. According to a 2003 report by the market research firm NPO Plog Research, the Walk attracts about 10 million visitors annually—more than [[Sunset Strip]], [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] (formerly Grauman's), the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'', and the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] combined—and has played an important role in making tourism the largest industry in [[Los Angeles County]].<ref name="Martin1">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/06/business/la-fi-walk-of-fame6-2010feb06|title=Golden milestone for the Hollywood Walk of Fame|last=Martin|first=Hugo|date=February 8, 2010|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324223751/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-feb-06-la-fi-walk-of-fame6-2010feb06-story.html |archivedate=2019-03-24 |accessdate=2020-06-01}}</ref>

=== Star locations ===
Locations of individual stars are not necessarily arbitrary. Stars of many particularly well-known celebrities are found in front of TCL (formerly Grauman's) Chinese Theatre. Oscar-winners' stars are usually placed near the Dolby Theatre, site of the annual [[Academy Awards]] presentations. Locations are occasionally chosen for ironic or humorous reasons: [[Mike Myers]]'s star lies in front of an adult store called the International Love Boutique, an association with his [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] roles; [[Roger Moore]]'s star is located at 7007 Hollywood Boulevard in recognition of his seven [[James Bond 007]] films; [[Ed O'Neill]]'s star is located outside a shoe store in reference to his character's occupation on the TV show ''[[Married ... with Children]]'';<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ed-oneills-walk-of-fame-star-in-front-of-shoe-store/ <!-- was http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20099294-10391698.html--> |title=Ed O'Neill's Walk of Fame star in front of shoe store – Celebrity Circuit |publisher=CBS News |date= |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref> and the last star, at the very end of the westernmost portion of the Walk, belongs to The [[Dead End Kids]].

Honorees may request a specific location for their star, although final decisions remain with the Chamber.<ref name="Q&A" /> [[Jay Leno]], for example, requested a spot near the corner of Hollywood Blvd. and Highland Ave. because he was twice picked up at that location by police for [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] (though never actually charged) shortly after his arrival in Hollywood.<ref>[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/leno-returns-to-scene-of-crime-for-hollywood-honor.aspx?pageID=438&n=leno-returns-to-scene-of-crime-for-hollywood-honor-2000-04-29 Leno returns to scene of crime for Hollywood honor].

The theater manager fired her on the spot for "insubordination" and humiliated her by stripping the epaulets from her uniform in the theater lobby. Twenty-six years later, at her request, Burnett's star was placed at the corner of Hollywood and Wilcox—in front of the theater.<ref name="Burnett">{{cite book|title=One More Time|url=https://archive.org/details/onemoretimememoiburn00burn|url-access=registration|last=Burnett|first=Carol|authorlink=Carol Burnett|year=1986|publisher=Random House|location=New York |isbn=0-394-55254-7|edition=first|pages=[https://archive.org/details/onemoretimememoiburn00burn/page/194 194–95]}}</ref>

=== Origin ===
[[File:Hollywood boulevard from kodak theatre.jpg|thumb|The Walk of Fame at the 6800 block of Hollywood Boulevard, looking eastward. The Dolby Theatre is in the foreground at left. In the upper left quadrant is the famous intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue.]]

The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce credits E.M. Stuart, its volunteer president in 1953, with the original idea for creating a Walk of Fame. Stuart reportedly proposed the Walk as a means to "maintain the glory of a community whose name means glamour and excitement in the four corners of the world."<ref name="historyof">{{cite web|title=History of the Walk of Fame|work=walkoffame.com|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}</ref> Harry Sugarman, another Chamber member and president of the Hollywood Improvement Association, received credit in an independent account.<ref name="LA Magazine">{{cite journal|last=Rozbrook|first=Roslyn|issue=February 1998|title=The Real Mr. Hollywood|journal=Los Angeles Magazine|date=February 1998|page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V0EAAAAMBAJ&q=hollywood+walk+of+fame+sugarman&pg=PA20|accessdate=June 6, 2010

Multiple accounts exist for the origin of the star concept. According to one, the historic [[Hollywood Hotel]]—which stood for more than 50 years on Hollywood Boulevard at the site now occupied by the [[Hollywood and Highland|Hollywood and Highland complex]] and the [[Dolby Theatre|Dolby (formerly Kodak) Theatre]]<ref>Garcia, Courtney (June 11, 2012) [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/11/entertainment-us-oscars-dolby-idUSBRE85A1MH20120611 "Out with Kodak, in with Dolby at home of Oscars"].

In February 1956, a prototype was unveiled featuring a [[caricature]] of an example honoree ([[John Wayne]], by some accounts<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=David|title=The Whole Equation: A History of Hollywood|publisher=Vintage|year=2006|isbn=0-375-70154-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/wholeequationhi00thom/page/149 149]|url=https://archive.org/details/wholeequationhi00thom/page/149}}</ref>) inside a blue star on a brown background.<ref name="historyof" /> However, caricatures proved too expensive and difficult to execute in brass with the technology available at the time; and the brown and blue motif was vetoed by [[Charles E. Toberman]], the legendary real estate developer known as "Mr. Hollywood", because the colors clashed with a new building he was erecting on Hollywood Boulevard.<ref name="historyof" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Gregory Paul|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9W4R_CZtFe8C|title=The Story of Hollywood: An Illustrated History|publisher=BL Press|isbn=978-0-9776299-0-9|accessdate=July 27, 2010}}</ref>

=== Selection and construction ===
By March 1956, the final design and coral-and-charcoal color scheme had been approved. Between the spring of 1956 and the fall of 1957, 1,558 honorees were selected by committees representing the four major branches of the entertainment industry at that time: motion pictures, television, audio recording, and radio. The committees met at the [[Brown Derby]] restaurant,<ref name="ap2006">{{cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/preview/articles/0630walkoffame0630.html<!-- was http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/0630walkoffame0630.html-->|title= Price of Fame in Hollywood? $15,000|author=Cohen, Sandy|newspaper=The Arizona Republic|date=June 30, 2006|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> and included such prominent names as [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[Jesse L. Lasky]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Hal Roach]], [[Mack Sennett]], and [[Walter Lantz]].<ref name="historyof" />
[[File:Hwof joanne woodward.jpg|thumb|left|Woodward's star, contrary to popular belief, was not the first.]]
A requirement stipulated by the original audio recording committee (and later rescinded) specified minimum sales of one million records or 250,000 albums for all music category nominees. The committee soon realized that many important recording artists would be excluded from the Walk by that requirement. As a result, the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] was formed to create a separate award for the music industry, leading to the first [[Grammy Award]]s in 1959.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&pg=3612,4838071&dq=paul+weston+grammy&hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|page=13|newspaper=The Robesonian|location=Lumberton, N.C.|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}</ref>

Construction of the Walk began in 1958 but two lawsuits delayed completion. The first lawsuit was filed by local property owners challenging the legality of the $1.25 million tax assessment levied upon them to pay for the Walk, along with new street lighting and trees. In October 1959, the assessment was ruled legal.<ref name="historyof" /> The second lawsuit, filed by [[Charles Chaplin Jr.]], sought damages for the exclusion of his father, whose nomination had been withdrawn due to pressure from multiple quarters (see [[Hollywood Walk of Fame#Controversial additions|Controversial additions]]). Chaplin's suit was dismissed in 1960, paving the way for completion of the project.<ref name="historyof" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/167734333.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Aug%2011,%201960&author=&pub=Los%20Angeles%20Times&edition=&startpage=&desc=Judge%20Refuses%20Chaplin%20Walk%20of%20Fame%20Request |title=Judge Refuses Chaplin Walk of Fame Request|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 11, 1960|page=B2|accessdate=June 11, 2010}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref name="LATimesWhy">{{cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/#no-love|title=Why doesn't Clint Eastwood have a star?|accessdate=May 20, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

=== Expansion ===
In 1984, a fifth category, Live Theatre, was added to acknowledge contributions from the live performance branch of the entertainment industry, and a second row of stars was created on each sidewalk to alternate with the existing stars.<ref name="historyof" />
[[File:Hollywood-walk-of-fame.jpg|thumb|upright|Hollywood Boulevard, 7000 block, north side, looking westward]]

In 1994, the Walk of Fame was extended one block to the west on Hollywood Boulevard, from Sycamore Avenue to North LaBrea Avenue (plus the short segment of Marshfield Way that connects Hollywood and La Brea), where it now ends at the silver "Four Ladies of Hollywood" gazebo and the special "Walk of Fame" star.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hwof.com/star/special/hollywood-walk-of-fame/3|title="Hollywood Walk of Fame" star|publisher=HWOF LLC|work=hwof.com|accessdate=May 27, 2011}}</ref> At the same time, [[Sophia Loren]] was honored with the 2,000th star on the Walk.<ref name="historyof" />

During construction of tunnels for the [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles subway system]] in 1996, the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) removed and stored more than 300 stars.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rescuing Elvis : Roadwork steals shine from icon's 'flaming star'|first=David |last=Bloom |newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News |date=December 4, 1996 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/RESCUING+ELVIS+%3a+ROADWORK+STEALS+SHINE+FROM+ICON%27S+%60FLAMING+STAR%27.-a084034046

=== Restoration ===
In 2008 a long-term restoration project began with an evaluation of all 2,365 stars on the Walk at the time, each receiving a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F. Honorees whose stars received F grades, indicating the most severe damage, were [[Joan Collins]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Dick Van Patten]], [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Andrew L. Stone]], [[Willard Waterman]], [[Richard Boleslavsky]], [[Ellen Drew]], [[Frank Crumit]], and [[Bobby Sherwood]]. Fifty celebrities' stars received "D" grades. The damage ranged from minor cosmetic flaws caused by normal weathering to holes and fissures severe enough to constitute a walking hazard. Plans were made to repair or replace at least 778 stars at an estimated cost of over $4 million.<ref name="LAT22">{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=July 22, 2008|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/22/local/me-walk22|title=Walk of Fame going to have a little work done|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref>

The restoration is a collaboration among the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and various Los Angeles city and county governmental offices, along with the MTA, which operates the [[B Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro B Line]] that runs beneath the Walk, since earth movement due to the presence of the subway line is thought to be partly responsible for the damage.<ref name="WOFfix">{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=July 17, 2008|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/17/local/me-walk17|title=Walk of Fame fix won't be easy stroll|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref>

To encourage supplemental funding for the project by corporate sponsors, the "Friends of Walk of Fame" program was inaugurated,<ref name="LAT22" /> with donors recognized through honorary plaques adjacent to the Walk of Fame in front of the Dolby Theatre.<ref name="LATAbs" /> The program has received some criticism; [[Alana Semuels]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described it as "just the latest corporate attempt to buy some good buzz," and quoted a brand strategist who said, "I think Johnny Grant would roll over in his grave."<ref name="LATAbs" />

In June 2019, The City of Los Angeles commissioned [[Gensler]] architects to provide a master plan for a $4 million renovation to improve and "update the streetscape concept" for the Walk of Fame with the goal of improving the public right-of-way.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://urbanize.la/post/hollywood-walk-fames-4-million-master-plan-moves-forward|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame's $4-Million Master Plan Moves Forward|date=June 14, 2019|website=Urbanize LA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/City-Selects-Firm-to-Design-Hollywood-Walk-of-Fame-Improvements-511169871.html|title=City Selects Firm for Hollywood Walk of Fame Improvements|first=City News|last=Service|website=NBC Southern California}}</ref>

== Nomination process ==
[[File:JamesCameronStarDec09.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Director James Cameron squats by his new star, left hand propping up his plaque|Director [[James Cameron]] unveiling his star, 2009]]
Each year an average of 200 nominations are submitted to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce Walk of Fame selection committee. Anyone, including fans, can nominate anyone active in the field of entertainment as long as the nominee or his or her management approves the nomination. Nominees must have a minimum of five years' experience in the category for which they are nominated and a history of "charitable contributions."<ref name="Jet111" /> Posthumous nominees must have been deceased at least five years. At a meeting each June, the committee selects approximately 20 to 24 celebrities to receive stars on the Walk of Fame. One posthumous award is given each year as well. The nominations of those not selected are rolled over to the following year for reconsideration; those not selected two years in a row are dropped, and must be renominated to receive further consideration. Living recipients must agree to personally attend a presentation ceremony within two years of selection. If the ceremony is not scheduled within two years, a new application must be submitted. A relative of deceased recipients must attend posthumous presentations. Presentation ceremonies are open to the public.<ref name="WOFFAQ" />

A fee of $50,000 ({{as of|2020|lc=y}}),<ref name="Walk of Fame FAQs" /> payable at time of selection, is collected to pay for the creation and installation of the star, as well as general maintenance of the Walk of Fame. The fee is usually paid by the nominating organization, which may be a fan club, film studio, record company, broadcaster, or other sponsor involved with the prospective honoree.<ref name="ap2006" /><ref>Donaldson-Evans, Catherine (December 3, 2003).

Traditionally, the identities of selection committee members, other than its chairman, have not been made public in order to minimize conflicts of interest and to discourage lobbying by celebrities and their representatives (a significant problem during the original selections in the late 1950s). However, in 1999, in response to intensifying charges of secrecy in the selection process, the Chamber disclosed the members' names: Johnny Grant, the longtime chair and representative of the television category; [[Earl Lestz]], president of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studio Group]] (motion pictures); Stan Spero, retired manager with broadcast stations [[KMPC]] and [[KABC (AM)|KABC]] (radio); Kate Nelson, owner of the [[Avalon Hollywood|Palace Theatre]] (live performance); and Mary Lou Dudas, vice president of [[A&M Records]] (recording industry).<ref>{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=January 6, 1999|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/06/local/me-60983|title=Hollywood Tries to Help Stars Shine|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Since that 1999 announcement the chamber has revealed only that Lestz (who received his own star in 2004) became chairman after Grant died in 2008. Their current official position is that "each of the five categories is represented by someone with expertise in that field."<ref name="WOFFAQ" />

Walk of Fame rules prohibit consideration of nominees whose contributions fall outside the five major entertainment categories, but the selection committee has been known to adjust interpretations of their rules to justify a selection. The Walk's four round Moon landing monuments at the corners of Hollywood and Vine, for example, officially recognize the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts for "contributions to the television industry". Johnny Grant acknowledged, in 2005, that classifying the first Moon landing as a television entertainment event was "a bit of a stretch".<ref name="Q&A" /> [[Magic Johnson]] was added to the motion picture category based on his ownership of the [[Magic Johnson Theatres|Magic Johnson Theatre]] chain, citing as precedent [[Sid Grauman]], builder of Grauman's (now [[TCL Chinese Theatre|TCL]]) Chinese Theatre.<ref name="Q&A" />

[[Muhammad Ali]]'s star was granted after the committee decided that [[boxing]] could be considered a form of "live performance".

All living honorees have been required since 1968 to personally attend their star's unveiling, and approximately 40 have declined the honor due to this condition.<ref name="Q&A" /> The only recipient to date who failed to appear after agreeing to do so was [[Barbra Streisand]], in 1976.

[[Charlie Chaplin]] is the only honoree to be selected twice for the same star on the Walk. He was unanimously voted into the initial group of 500 in 1956 but the Selection Committee ultimately excluded him, ostensibly due to questions regarding his morals (he had been charged with violating the [[Mann Act]]—and exonerated—during the [[Sexual slavery#White slavery|White Slavery]] hysteria of the 1940s),<ref>"When the not-guilty verdict was handed down, the courtroom audience cheered.

Four of the stars, which weigh about {{convert|300|lb|kg}} each, have been stolen from the Walk of Fame. In 2000, [[James Stewart]]'s and [[Kirk Douglas]]'s stars disappeared from their locations near the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, where they had been temporarily removed for a construction project. Police recovered them in the suburban community of [[South Gate, California|South Gate]] when they arrested a man involved in an incident there and searched his house. The suspect was a construction worker employed on the Hollywood and Vine project. The stars had been badly damaged, and had to be remade. One of [[Gene Autry]]'s five stars was also stolen from a construction area. Another theft occurred in 2005 when thieves used a [[concrete saw]] to remove [[Gregory Peck]]'s star from its Hollywood Boulevard site at the intersection of North El Centro Avenue, near North Gower.

[[File:Four Ladies of Hollywood 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|''Hollywood and La Brea Gateway'' at the Walk of Fame's west end]]
The ''Hollywood and La Brea Gateway'' is a 1993 cast stainless steel public art installation by architect [[Catherine Hardwicke]].<ref name="Deioma">Deioma, Kayte (2004). [http://golosangeles.about.com/od/laphotogalleries/ig/Hollywood-Photo-Tour/Gateway-to-Hollywood-Sculpture.htm "Hollywood La Brea Gateway&nbsp;– The Four Ladies Statue"]. (Photo gallery). ''Golosangeles.about.com''. Retrieved May 31, 2010</ref> The sculpture is also known as ''The Four Ladies of Hollywood'', and it was commissioned by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency Art Program as a tribute to the multi-ethnic women of Hollywood.<ref name="Art">[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!337237!0#focus "Hollywood and La Brea Gateway" (sculpture)] Smithsonian American Museum Art Inventories Catalog. Retrieved June 17, 2010.</ref> The installation consists of a square stainless steel [[Art Deco]]-style structure or gazebo, with an arched roof supporting a circular dome that is topped by a central [[obelisk]] with descending neon block letters spelling "Hollywood" on each of its four sides. Atop the obelisk is a small gilded weather vane-style sculpture of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in her iconic billowing skirt pose from ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]''. The corners of the domed structure are supported by four [[caryatid]]s sculpted by Harl West<ref name="Art" /> in the form of African-American actress [[Dorothy Dandridge]], Asian-American actress [[Anna May Wong]], Mexican actress [[Dolores del Río]], and Brooklyn-born actress [[Mae West]].<ref>[http://www.justabovesunset.com/photography/html/the_silver_women.html "The Silver Women" (photo montage)]. JustAboveSunset.com. Retrieved June 17, 2010.</ref>  The installation stands at the western end of the Hollywood Walk of Fame at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and North La Brea Avenue.<ref name="Deioma" />

The gazebo was dedicated on February 1, 1994, to a mixed reception. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art critic Christopher Knight called it "the most depressingly awful work of public art in recent years", representing the opposite of Hardwicke's intended tribute to women. "Sex, as a woman's historic gateway to Hollywood", he wrote, "couldn't be more explicitly described".<ref>{{cite news|last=Knight|first=Christopher|date=January 19, 1994|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-19/entertainment/ca-13098_1_la-brea-gateway|title=Caution: Bad Art Up Ahead|newspaper=Los Angeles Times (archives)|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

Independent writer and film producer Gail Choice called it a fitting tribute to a group of pioneering and courageous women who "carried a tremendous burden on their feminine shoulders." "Never in my wildest dreams did I believe I'd ever see women of color immortalized in such a creative and wonderful fashion."<ref>{{cite news|last=Choice|first=Gale|date=February 14, 1994|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-14/entertainment/ca-22913_1_pioneering-women|title=These Women Were Dreamers and Doers|newspaper=Los Angeles Times (archives)|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> Hardwicke contended that critics had missed the "humor and symbolism" of the structure, which "embraces and pokes fun at the glamour, the polished metallic male form of the Oscar, and the pastiche of styles and dreams that pervades Tinseltown."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hardwicke|first= Catherine|date=February 14, 1994|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-14/entertainment/ca-22915_1_art-critic|title=Critic Missed the Humor and Symbolism|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

In June 2019, the Marilyn Monroe statue above the gazebo was stolen by a man who had vandalized Donald Trump's star a year earlier.<ref name=":1" />
