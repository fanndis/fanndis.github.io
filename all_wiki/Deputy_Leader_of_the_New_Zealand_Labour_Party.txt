==History==
The position of deputy leader of the New Zealand Labour Party was created in 1919, three years after the party's creation. The first holder, [[James McCombs]], was bestowed the role after he lost the draw of lots to [[Harry Holland]] in the [[1919 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|leadership election]] that year.<ref name="DNZB James McCombs">{{DNZB|Garner |Jean |3m3|McCombs, James|28 January 2011}}</ref> It was not until 1974 that the first deputy to have been born in New Zealand, [[Bob Tizard]]. Prior to this, three deputy leaders had been born in [[Australia]], two in [[England]] and one each in [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]]. The Labour Party's longest-serving deputy leader, having served for 11 years, 4 months and 12 days between 1963 and 1974, was [[Hugh Watt]].

To date, a total of eight deputy leaders have gone on to become the elected leader of the Labour Party ([[Michael Joseph Savage|Savage]], [[Peter Fraser|Fraser]], [[Walter Nash|Nash]], [[David Lange|Lange]], [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Palmer]], [[Helen Clark|Clark]] and [[Jacinda Ardern|Ardern]]). Two deputy leaders have died in office ([[Jerry Skinner|Skinner]] and [[Fred Hackett|Hackett]]).
