As prime minister, Gandhi was known for her political intransigency and unprecedented [[Centralized government|centralisation of power]]. She went to [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war with Pakistan]] in support of the [[Six point movement|independence movement]] and [[Bangladesh Liberation War|war of independence]] in [[East Pakistan]], which resulted in an Indian victory and the creation of [[Bangladesh]], as well as increasing India's influence to the point where it became the sole [[regional power]] of [[South Asia]]. Citing separatist tendencies, and in response to a call for revolution, Gandhi instituted a [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] from 1975 to 1977 where basic civil liberties were suspended and the press was censored. Widespread atrocities were carried out during the emergency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/democracy-interrupted-some-lesser-known-facts-about-emergency-1975-77/emergency/slideshow/69940337.cms|title=The darkest phase in Indira's tenure as PM – Emergency!|website=The Economic Times}}</ref> In 1980, she [[1980 Indian general election|returned to power]] after free and fair elections.

During her time in Europe, Indira was plagued with ill-health and was constantly attended to by doctors. She had to make repeated trips to Switzerland to recover, disrupting her studies. She was being treated there in 1940, when Germany rapidly conquered Europe. Indira tried to return to England through Portugal but was left stranded for nearly two months. She managed to enter England in early 1941, and from there returned to India without completing her studies at Oxford. The university later awarded her an honorary degree. In 2010, Oxford honoured her further by selecting her as one of the ten Oxasians, illustrious Asian graduates from the [[University of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/100422_1.html |title=Exhibit celebrates 120 years of South Asians at Oxford |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |date=22 April 2010 |access-date=24 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102074542/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/100422_1.html |archive-date=2 January 2013 }}</ref><ref name="degree">{{cite web|title=Rahul first in three generations with a world university degree|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20140218/main6.htm|work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|access-date=18 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220725/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20140218/main6.htm|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> During her stay in Britain, Indira frequently met her future husband [[Feroze Gandhi]] (no relation to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]), whom she knew from Allahabad, and who was studying at the [[London School of Economics]].

==First term as Prime Minister between 1966 and 1977==
Her first eleven years serving as Prime Minister saw Gandhi evolve from the perception of Congress party leaders as their puppet, to a strong leader with the iron resolve to split the party over her policy positions, or to go to war with Pakistan to liberate Bangladesh. At the end of 1977, she was such a dominating figure in Indian politics that Congress party president [[D. K. Barooah]] had coined the phrase "India is Indira and Indira is India."<ref>Ghosh, P.S., 1999. Whither Indian Polity?. [[Economic and Political Weekly]], pp.3340–3342.</ref>

===First year===
Gandhi formed her government with Morarji Desai as deputy Prime Minister and finance minister. At the beginning of her first term as prime minister, she was widely criticised by the media and the opposition as a "''Goongi goodiya''" (Hindi for a "dumb doll" or "puppet") of the Congress party bosses who had orchestrated her election and then tried to constrain her.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Derichs|editor-first=Claudia |last=Thompson|first=Mark R.|title=Dynasties and female political leaders in Asia : gender, power and pedigree|date=2013|publisher=[[LIT Verlag]]|location=London|isbn=978-3-643-90320-4|pages=32, 50|url={{Google books|UKBcLhCxSvQC|page=PA27|keywords=%22goongi%20gudiya%22%20indira|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Shankar|first1=Kalyani|title=Pandora's daughters|date=2013|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] India|location=London|isbn=9789382951049|url={{Google books|_knCBwAAQBAJ|page=PT8|keywords=goongi|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref>

===1967–1971===
[[File:John_Gorton_and_Indira_Gandhi.jpg|thumb|left|Indira Gandhi with Australian [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Gorton]] in 1968]]
The first electoral test for Gandhi was the [[1967 Indian general election|1967 general elections]] for the [[Lok Sabha]] and state assemblies. The Congress Party won a reduced majority in the Lok Sabha after these elections owing to widespread disenchantment over the rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation and a food crisis. Gandhi was elected to the Lok Sabha from the [[Raebareli (Lok Sabha constituency)|Raebareli constituency]]. She had a rocky start after agreeing to [[devaluation|devalue]] the [[Indian rupee|rupee]] which created hardship for Indian businesses and consumers. The importation of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.<ref name="Kapila1"/>

For the first time, the party also lost power or lost its majority in a number of states across the country. Following the 1967 elections, Gandhi gradually began to move towards socialist policies. In 1969, she fell out with senior Congress party leaders over several issues. Chief among them was her decision to support [[V. V. Giri]], the independent candidate rather than the official Congress party candidate [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]] for the vacant position of [[president of India]]. The other was the announcement by the prime minister of Bank nationalisation without consulting the finance minister, Morarji Desai. These steps culminated in party president [[S. Nijalingappa]] expelling her from the party for indiscipline.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/march-to-socialism-under-prime-minister-indira-gandhi-offers-an-interesting-parallel/articleshow/9715049.cms|title=March to socialism under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi offers an interesting parallel|date=24 August 2011|work=[[The Economic Times]]|access-date=19 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010075812/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/march-to-socialism-under-prime-minister-indira-gandhi-offers-an-interesting-parallel/articleshow/9715049.cms|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1969-congress-splits/1/155566.html|title=1969: S.

[[Garibi Hatao]] (Eradicate Poverty) was the resonant theme for Gandhi's 1971 political bid. The slogan was developed in response to the combined opposition alliance's use of the two word manifesto—"Indira Hatao" (Remove Indira).<ref name="1971.iz iz result">{{cite web|title=General Elections, India, 1971: Statistical report |url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/statisticalreports/LS_1971/Vol_I_LS71.pdf |website=eci.nic.in |publisher=Commission of India |access-date=25 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718175452/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1971/Vol_I_LS71.pdf |archive-date=18 July 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Masani|first1=Zareer|title=The Indira Wave|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/article2950165.ece|access-date=8 January 2015|issue=3 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903232831/http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/article2950165.ece|archive-date=3 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=IGIN/> The Garibi Hatao slogan and the proposed [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty programs]] that came with it were designed to give Gandhi independent national support, based on the rural and urban poor.

Despite the victory against Pakistan, the Congress government faced numerous problems during this term. Some of these were due to high inflation which in turn was caused by wartime expenses, drought in some parts of the country and, more importantly, the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Opposition to her in the 1973–75 period, after the Gandhi wave had receded, was strongest in the states of [[Bihar]] and [[Gujarat]].

====Verdict on electoral malpractice====
[[File:Indira and Nixon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Indira Gandhi with U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], 1971]]
On 12 June 1975, the [[Allahabad High Court]] declared Indira Gandhi's election to the Lok Sabha in 1971 void on the grounds of electoral malpractice. In an election petition filed by her 1971 opponent, [[Raj Narain]] (who later defeated her in the 1977 parliamentary election running in the Raebareli constituency), alleged several major as well as minor instances of the use of government resources for campaigning.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/12/newsid_2511000/2511691.stm|title=BBC On This Day {{!}} 12 {{!}} 1975: Gandhi found guilty of corruption|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=19 July 2017|date=12 June 1975|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623125017/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/12/newsid_2511000/2511691.stm|archive-date=23 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Priyadarshi, D., 1975.

The court ordered her stripped of her parliamentary seat and banned her from running for any office for six years. As the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] requires that the Prime Minister must be a [[Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha|member]] of either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha, the two houses of the [[Parliament of India]], she was effectively removed from office. However, Gandhi rejected calls to resign. She announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and insisted that the conviction did not undermine her position. She said: "There is a lot of talk about our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [opposition] parties were forming governments."<ref name=":0"/> And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her.

After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom [[Braj Kumar Nehru]] said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. "Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country," he said. "I believe the prime minister of India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise".<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/12/newsid_2511000/2511691.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=1975: Gandhi found guilty of corruption|date=12 June 1975|access-date=11 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217171952/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/12/newsid_2511000/2511691.stm|archive-date=17 December 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

====State of Emergency (1975–1977)====
{{Main|The Emergency (India)}}
Gandhi moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. Her Cabinet and government then recommended that President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] declare a [[state of emergency]] because of the disorder and lawlessness following the Allahabad High Court decision. Accordingly, Ahmed declared a State of Emergency caused by internal disorder, based on the provisions of Article 352(1) of the Constitution, on 25 June 1975.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thelogicalindian.com/rewind/emergency-imposed-by-indira-gandhi-government/ |title=A Page From The Past: All You Need To Know About Emergency Imposed By Indira Gandhi Government |date=25 June 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=20 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200414172700/https://thelogicalindian.com/rewind/emergency-imposed-by-indira-gandhi-government/ |archive-date=14 April 2020 }}</ref>

====Rule by decree====
Within a few months, [[President's rule]] was imposed on the two opposition party ruled states of Gujarat and [[Tamil Nadu]] thereby bringing the entire country under direct Central rule or by governments led by the ruling Congress party.<ref>Kochanek, Stanely, ''Mrs. Gandhi's Pyramid: The New Congress'', ([[Westview Press]], Boulder, CO 1976) p. 98</ref> Police were granted powers to impose curfews and detain citizens indefinitely; all publications were subjected to substantial censorship by the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]]. Finally, the impending legislative assembly elections were postponed indefinitely, with all opposition-controlled state governments being removed by virtue of the constitutional provision allowing for a dismissal of a state government on the recommendation of the state's governor.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Malhotra|first=Inder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRxnDwAAQBAJ&q=indira+gandhi|title=Indira Gandhi: A Personal and Political Biography|date=1 February 2014|publisher=[[Hay House]], Inc.|isbn=978-93-84544-16-4|language=en}}</ref>

Indira Gandhi used the emergency provisions to change conflicting party members:

President Ahmed issued [[decree|ordinances]] that did not require debate in the Parliament, allowing Gandhi to [[rule by decree]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8IUE33Vrdx0C&q=Ahmed+issued+ordinances+that+did+not+require+debate+in+Parliament,+allowing+Gandhi+to+rule+by+decree&pg=PA225 |title=Eq And Leadership |last=Joseph |first=P.T. |year=2007 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Educational |page=225 |isbn=9780070617940 |access-date=20 April 2020}}</ref>

====Rise of Sanjay====
The Emergency saw the entry of Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi, into Indian politics. He wielded tremendous power during the emergency without holding any government office.  According to [[Mark Tully]], "His inexperience did not stop him from using the Draconian powers his mother, Indira Gandhi, had taken to terrorise the administration, setting up what was in effect a police state."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tully |first=Mark |title=Amritsar: Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle |publisher=[[Rupa & Co.]] |year=1985 |isbn=81-291-0917-4 |location=New Delhi |pages=55}}</ref>

==1977 election and opposition years==
[[File:Face detail, Premier Indira Gandhi (Congrespartij), Bestanddeelnr 929-0811 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Indira Gandhi on 21 March 1977]]
In 1977, after extending the state of emergency twice, Gandhi called [[1977 Indian general election|elections]] to give the electorate a chance to vindicate her rule. She may have grossly misjudged her popularity by reading what the heavily censored press wrote about her.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Derfler|first1=Leslie|title=The fall and rise of political leaders Olof Palme, Olusegun Obasanjo, and Indira Gandhi|date=2011|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=New York|isbn=9780230117242|pages=186–187|edition=1st|url={{Google books|7VjJAAAAQBAJ|page=PR2|keywords=sterilization|text=|plainurl=yes}}|access-date=14 September 2017}}</ref> She was opposed by the [[Janata alliance]] of Opposition parties. The alliance was made up of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], Congress (O), The Socialist parties, and [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Kranti Dal]] representing northern peasants and farmers. The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between "democracy and dictatorship". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, Jayaprakash Narayan. The other leaders of the Janata Party were Charan Singh, Raj Narain, [[George Fernandes]] and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rudolph|first1=Lloyd I.| author-link = Lloyd Rudolph|first2=Susanne|last2= Hoeber|author-link2=Susanne Hoeber Rudolph|title=In pursuit of Lakshmi: The political economy of the Indian state|date=1989|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226731391|pages=159–178|edition=[Nachdr.]|url={{Google books|amtV90ig9-8C|page=PR16|keywords=1977%20janata%20|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref>

Since Gandhi had lost her seat in the election, the defeated Congress party appointed [[Yashwantrao Chavan]] as their parliamentary party leader. Soon afterwards, the Congress party split again with Gandhi floating her own Congress faction.

Following the 1977 elections, a coalition led by the [[Sikh]]-majority [[Shiromani Akali Dal|Akali Dal]] came to power in the northern Indian state of Punjab.

After several futile negotiations, in June 1984, Gandhi ordered the Indian army to enter the Golden Temple to remove Bhindranwale and his supporters from the complex. The army used heavy artillery, including tanks, in the action code-named [[Operation Blue Star]]. The operation badly damaged or destroyed parts of the Temple complex, including the [[Akal Takht]] shrine and the Sikh library. It also led to the deaths of many Sikh fighters and innocent pilgrims.

Gandhi's approach to dealing with Sri Lanka's [[Sri Lankan Civil War|ethnic problems]] was initially accommodating. She enjoyed cordial relations with Prime Minister [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]].

India's relationship with Pakistan remained strained following the [[Simla Agreement|Shimla Accord]] in 1972. Gandhi's [[Smiling Buddha|authorisation of the detonation of a nuclear device]] at Pokhran in 1974 was viewed by Pakistani leader [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] as an attempt to intimidate Pakistan into accepting India's hegemony in the subcontinent.

===Middle East===
Gandhi remained a staunch supporter of the Palestinians in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and was critical of the Middle East diplomacy sponsored by the United States.{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=5}} [[Israel]] was viewed as a religious state, and thus [[Two-nation theory|an analogue]] to India's [[archrival]] Pakistan. Indian diplomats hoped to win Arab support in countering Pakistan in [[Kashmir]]. Nevertheless, Gandhi authorised the development of a secret channel of contact and security assistance with Israel in the late 1960s. Her lieutenant, [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]], later became prime minister and approved full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992.<ref name="AKapur">{{cite book|first=Ashok|last=Kapur|title=India: From Regional to World Power |url=https://archive.org/details/indiafromregiona00kapu|url-access=limited|publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/indiafromregiona00kapu/page/n225 215] |isbn=978-0415328043}}</ref>

India's pro-Arab policy had mixed success. Establishment of close ties with the socialist and secular [[Ba'athism|Baathist]] regimes to some extent neutralised Pakistani propaganda against India.<ref name="Ghosh">{{cite book|first=Anjali|last=Ghosh|title=India's Foreign Policy |publisher=[[Pearson plc|Pearson]]|year=2009|pages=306–307|isbn=978-8131710258}}</ref> However, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 presented a dilemma for the Arab and Muslim states of the Middle East as the war was fought by two states both friendly to the Arabs.<ref name="Kaur">{{cite book|first=Ranjit|last=Kaur|title=Islamic Co-Operation and Unity|publisher=Deep and Deep Publications |year=1993 |pages=168–170|isbn=978-8171005642}}</ref> The progressive Arab regimes in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and [[Algeria]] chose to remain neutral, while the conservative pro-American Arab monarchies in [[Jordan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], and [[United Arab Emirates]] openly supported Pakistan.

===Asia-Pacific===
One of the major developments in [[Southeast Asia]] during Gandhi's premiership was the formation of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in 1967. Relations between ASEAN and India were mutually antagonistic. India perceived ASEAN to be linked to the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) and, therefore, it was seen as a pro-American organisation. On their part, the ASEAN nations were unhappy with Gandhi's sympathy for the [[Viet Cong]] and India's strong links with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Furthermore, they were also apprehensions in the region about Gandhi's plans, particularly after India played a big role in breaking up Pakistan and facilitating the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country in 1971. India's entry into the nuclear weapons club in 1974 also contributed to tensions in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Nanda>{{cite book|last=Nanda|first=Prakash|title=Rediscovering Asia: Evolution of India's Look-East Policy|publisher=[[Lancer Publishers & Distributors|Lancer Publishers]]|isbn=978-8170622970|year=2003|pages=220–226}}</ref> Relations only began to improve following Gandhi's endorsement of the [[Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality|ZOPFAN declaration]] and the disintegration of the SEATO alliance in the aftermath of Pakistani and American defeats in the region. Nevertheless, Gandhi's close relations with reunified [[Vietnam]] and her decision to recognize the Vietnam-installed Government of [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|Cambodia]] in 1980 meant that India and ASEAN were unable to develop a viable partnership.<ref name=Nanda/>

On 26&nbsp;September 1981, Gandhi was conferred with the honorary degree of Doctor at the Laucala Graduation at the [[University of the South Pacific]] in Fiji.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usp.ac.fj/index.php?id=13882|title=USP: Honorary Degree of Doctor|website=www.usp.ac.fj|access-date=2 January 2020}}</ref>

===Africa===
Although independent India was initially viewed as a champion of various African independence movements, its cordial relationship with the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and its liberal views of British policies in [[East Africa]] had harmed its image as a staunch supporter of various independence movements in the [[third world]].<ref name="Ghosh2">{{cite book|first=Anjali|last=Ghosh|title=India's Foreign Policy|publisher=[[Pearson plc|Pearson]]|year=2009|pages=422–424|isbn=978-8131710258}}</ref> Indian condemnation of militant struggles in [[Mau Mau Uprising|Kenya]] and [[Algerian War|Algeria]] was in sharp contrast to China, who had supported armed struggle to win African independence.<ref name="Ghosh2"/> After reaching a high diplomatic point in the aftermath of Nehru's role in the [[Suez Crisis]], India's isolation from Africa was complete when only four nations—[[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and Libya—supported her during the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962.<ref name="Ghosh2"/> After Gandhi became prime minister, diplomatic and economic relations with the states which had sided with India during the Sino-Indian War were expanded.<ref name="Ghosh2"/> Gandhi began negotiations with the Kenyan government to establish the Africa-India Development Cooperation. The Indian government also started considering the possibility of bringing Indians settled in Africa within the framework of its policy goals to help recover its declining geo-strategic influence. Gandhi declared the people of Indian origin settled in Africa as "Ambassadors of India".<ref name="Ghosh2"/> Efforts to rope in the Asian community to join Indian diplomacy, however, came to naught, in part because of the unwillingness of Indians to remain in politically insecure surroundings, and because of the exodus of African Indians to Britain with the passing of the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968|Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] in 1968.<ref name="Ghosh2"/> In [[Uganda]], the African Indian community [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|suffered persecution and eventually expulsion]] under the government of [[Idi Amin]].<ref name="Oonk">{{cite book|first=Gijsbert|last=Oonk|title=Global Indian Diasporas: Exploring Trajectories of Migration and Theory|publisher=[[Amsterdam University Press]]|year=2007|page=189|isbn=978-9053560358}}</ref>

===The Commonwealth===
[[File:Chegada ao Rio de Janeiro de Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi, primeira ministra da Índia..tif|thumb|Indira Gandhi on a visit to Brazil, 1968, [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil]]]]

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] is a voluntary association of mainly former British colonies. India maintained cordial relations with most of the members during Gandhi's time in power. In the 1980s, she, along with Canadian [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]], Zambia's [[President of Zambia|president]] [[Kenneth Kaunda]], Australian [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]] [[Malcolm Fraser]] and Singapore [[Prime Minister of Singapore|prime minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] was regarded as one of the pillars of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Low|first1=D.A.|title=The contraction of England : an inaugural lecture delivered before the University of Cambridge on 22 October 1984|date=1984|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|isbn=9780521314244|page=28|url={{Google books|U8o7AAAAIAAJ|page=PA42|keywords=gandhi|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> India under Gandhi also hosted the 1983 [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]] summit in New Delhi.

===The Non-aligned Movement===
[[File:Indira Gandhi & Nicolae Ceauşescu.jpg|thumb|Gandhi with [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] {{Center|in 1969}}]]

In the early 1980s under Gandhi, India attempted to reassert its prominent role in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] by focusing on the relationship between disarmament and economic development. By appealing to the economic grievances of [[Developing country|developing countries]], Gandhi and her successors exercised a moderating influence on the Non-aligned movement, diverting it from some of the [[Cold War]] issues that marred the controversial 1979 Havana meeting where Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] attempted to steer the movement towards the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gupte|first1=Pranay|title=Mother India : a political biography of Indira Gandhi|date=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=New York|isbn=9780143068266|pages=499–500|edition=Rev.|url={{Google books|OOmK1lPWq80C|page=PR9|keywords=%22non%20aligned%20movement%22%20india%20indira|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> Although hosting the 1983 summit at Delhi boosted Indian prestige within the movement, its close relations with the Soviet Union and its pro-Soviet positions on [[Afghanistan]] and [[Cambodia]] limited its influence.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Western Europe===
Gandhi spent a number of years in Europe during her youth and had formed many friendships there. During her premiership she formed friendships with many leaders such as West German chancellor, [[Willy Brandt]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Willy|translator-last=Bell|translator-first=Anthea|title=Arms and hunger|date=1987|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262521277|pages=43–44|edition=1st MIT Press English language pbk.|url={{Google books|hBhr8W16XWMC|page=PP11|keywords=indira|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> and Austrian chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kreisky|first1=Bruno|last2=Lewis|first2=Jill|last3=Rathkolb|first3=Oliver|title=The struggle for a democratic Austria : Bruno Kreisky on peace and social justice|date=2000|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1571811554|pages=413–414|url={{Google books|lb6uBAAAQBAJ|page=PR11|keywords=%20gandhi|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> She also enjoyed a close working relationship with many British leaders including conservative premiers, [[Edward Heath]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gupte|first1=Pranay|title=Mother India : a political biography of Indira Gandhi|date=1992|publisher=[[Scribner's]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-684-19296-3|pages=516–517|url={{Google books|OOmK1lPWq80C|page=PR9|keywords=%20thatcher|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref>

===Soviet Union and Eastern block countries===
The relationship between India and the Soviet Union deepened during Gandhi's rule. The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name="British Academic Press">{{cite book|editor1-last=Light|editor1-first=Margot |last=Duncan|first=Peter J.S. |title=Troubled friendships : Moscow's Third World ventures, Chapter II, Soviet-Indian Model|date=1993|publisher=British Academic Press|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9781850436492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7MA1F1TD08C&pg=PA29}}</ref>

===United States===
[[File:Indira Gandhi and LBJ meeting in the Oval Office (1).tif|thumb|right|Indira Gandhi meeting President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the Oval Office on 28&nbsp;March 1966]]
When Gandhi came to power in 1966, Lyndon Johnson was the US president. At the time, India was reliant on the US for food aid. Gandhi resented the US policy of food aid being used as a tool to force India to adopt policies favoured by the US. She also resolutely refused to sign the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT). Relations with the US were strained badly under President Richard Nixon and his favouring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war. Nixon despised Gandhi politically and personally.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Van Dijk|editor1-first=Ruud|editor2-last=Glenn Gray|editor2-first=William|editor3-last=Savranskaya|editor3-first=Svetlana|editor4-last=Suri|editor4-first=Jeremi|editor5-last=Zhai|editor5-first=Qiang |title=Encyclopedia of the Cold War.|date=2008|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|isbn=9780203880210|pages=340–341|url={{Google books|QgX0bQ3Enj4C|page=PR3|keywords=%22indira%20gandhi%22%20johnson|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> In 1981, Gandhi met President [[Ronald Reagan]] for the first time at the [[North–South Summit]] held to discuss global poverty.

In this context, Gandhi was accused of formulating populist policies to suit her political needs. She was seemingly against the rich and big business while preserving the status quo to manipulate the support of the left in times of political insecurity, such as the late 1960s.{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}}<ref name="Jaffrelot">{{Cite book| publisher = [[C.

She had only a general and traditional commitment to the ideology by way of her political and family ties.<ref name="Steinberg"/> Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she gave as prime minister, Gandhi had ruminated: "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term&nbsp;... we used the word [socialism] because it came closest to what we wanted to do here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all."<ref name="Steinberg"/> Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by ''Hindustan Times'' columnist, Pankaj Vohra, as "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century."<ref name="aam aadmi"/> Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao ('Remove Poverty'), has become an often used motto of the Indian National Congress Party.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nation-world/top-six-political-slogans-and-their-impact/indira-hatao-desh-bachao/slideshow/23599159.cms |title=Top six political slogans and their impact |date=6 October 2013 |website=economictimes.indiatimes.com |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref> To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India, Gandhi was "Indira Amma or Mother Indira."<ref name="Chandra 2007c">{{Cite book

===Green Revolution and the Fourth Five-Year Plan===
Gandhi inherited a weak and troubled economy. Fiscal problems associated with the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence.<ref name="Kapila1">{{Cite book| publisher =Academic Foundation| page = 126|url={{Google books|de66PkzcfusC|page=PA126|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8171881055| last1 = Kapila| first1 = Raj| last2= Kapila| first2= Uma| title = Understanding India's economic Reforms| year = 2004}}</ref><ref name="Rosser"/> The government responded by taking steps to liberalise the economy and agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid.<ref name="Kapila1"/> The economy managed to recover in 1966 and ended up growing at 4.1% over 1966–1969.{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}}<ref name="Nayak">{{Cite book| publisher = [[SAGE Publications]]| pages = 8–9|url={{Google books|TxkfWrkb2n4C|page=PA8|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8132104520| last = Nayak| first =  Pulin|author2=Bishwanath Goldar |author3=Pradeep Agrawal

At the same time, Indo-US relations were strained because of Gandhi's criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam. While it was thought at the time, and for decades after, that President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]]'s policy of withholding [[Food for Peace|food grain shipments]] was to coerce Indian support for the war, in fact, it was to offer India rainmaking technology that he wanted to use as a counterweight to China's possession of the atomic bomb.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/khb3/Osiris/papers/Doel-Harper.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215072525/http://faculty.georgetown.edu/khb3/Osiris/papers/Doel-Harper.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Oliver">{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Oliver|title=George Woods and the World Bank|year=1995|page=144|isbn=978-1555875039}}</ref> In light of the circumstances, liberalisation became politically suspect and was soon abandoned.<ref name="Kapila1"/> Grain diplomacy and currency devaluation became matters of intense national pride in India.

The period of 1967–75 was characterised by socialist ascendency in India, which culminated in 1976 with the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|official declaration of state socialism]]. Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, "growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance."{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}}<ref name="Gupta">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K. L.|author2=Harvinder Kaur| title = New Indian Economy and Reforms| year = 2004}}</ref> The rationale behind the overall plan was Gandhi's ''Ten-Point Programme'' of 1967. This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as "protectionist as ever."<ref name="Kirk"/>

To deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name="Rosser"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>

The economic period of 1967–75 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name="Rosser"/>

Some other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974–75. Nevertheless, the success of the overall economic plan was tempered by the fact that annual growth at 3.3–3.4% over 1969–74 fell short of the targeted figure.{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}}

===State of Emergency and the Fifth Five-Year Plan===
The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974–79) was enacted against the backdrop of the state of emergency and the ''Twenty Point Program'' of 1975.{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}} It was the economic rationale of the emergency, a political act which has often been justified on economic grounds.{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}} In contrast to the reception of Gandhi's earlier economic plan, this one was criticised for being a "hastily thrown together wish list."{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}} Gandhi promised to reduce poverty by targeting the consumption levels of the poor and enact wide-ranging social and economic reforms. In addition, the government targeted an annual growth rate of 4.4% over the period of the plan.<ref name="Growth statistics"/>

The measures of the emergency regime was able to halt the economic trouble of the early to mid-1970s, which had been marred by harvest failures, fiscal contraction, and the breakdown of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of fixed exchanged rates. The resulting turbulence in the foreign exchange markets was accentuated further by the oil shock of 1973.<ref name="Nayak"/> The government was able to exceed the targeted growth figure with an annual growth rate of 5.0–5.2% over the five-year period of the plan (1974–79).<ref name="Growth statistics"/>{{sfn|Malik|1988|pp=60–72}} The economy grew at the rate of 9% in 1975–76 alone, and the Fifth Plan, became the first plan during which the per capita income of the economy grew by over 5%.<ref name="Kelly">{{Cite book| publisher = [[World Scientific]]| page = 62|url={{Google books|eijMYAdeLkYC|page=PA62|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=9789812564948| last = Kelly| first =  D.

Victory over Pakistan in 1971 consolidated Indian power in Kashmir. Gandhi indicated that she would make no major concessions on Kashmir. The most prominent of the Kashmiri separatists, [[Sheikh Abdullah]], had to recognise India's control over Kashmir in light of the new order in South Asia. The situation was normalised in the years following the war after Abdullah [[1975 Indira–Sheikh accord|agreed to an accord]] with Gandhi, by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in return for a [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special autonomous status for Kashmir]]. In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India.

Gandhi questioned the continued existence of a privy purse for former rulers of princely states. She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the Jana Sangh and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the Parliament in 1970. It was passed in the Lok Sabha but fell short of the two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognising the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was passed successfully as the 26th Amendment to the Constitution of India.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections. However, they received a final setback when many of them were defeated by huge margins.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Gandhi claimed that only "clear vision, iron will and the strictest discipline" can remove poverty.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> She justified the imposition of the state of emergency in 1975 in the name of the socialist mission of the Congress.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> Armed with the power to rule by decree and without constitutional constraints, Gandhi embarked on a massive redistribution program.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> The provisions included rapid enforcement of land ceilings, housing for landless labourers, the abolition of bonded labour and a moratorium on the debts of the poor.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> North India was at the centre of the reforms. millions of acres of land were acquired and redistributed.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> The government was also successful in procuring houses for landless labourers; According to [[Francine Frankel]], three-fourths of the targeted four million houses was achieved in 1975 alone.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> Nevertheless, others have disputed the success of the program and criticised Gandhi for not doing enough to reform land ownership. The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned "...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?"<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to "talk left and act right", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> [[J. Barkley Rosser Jr.]] wrote that "some have even seen the declaration of emergency rule in 1975 as a move to suppress dissent against Gandhi's policy shift to the right."<ref name="Rosser"/> Regardless of the controversy over the nature of the reforms, the long-term effects of the social changes gave rise to the prominence of middle-ranking farmers from intermediate and lower castes in North India.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> The rise of these newly empowered social classes challenged the political establishment of the [[Hindi Belt]] in the years to come.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/>

===Language policy===
Under the 1950 Constitution of India, Hindi was to have become the official national language by 1965. This was unacceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, which wanted the continued use of English in government. In 1967, Gandhi introduced a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages. This established the official government policy of bilingualism in India and satisfied the non-Hindi speaking Indian states.<ref name="Steinberg"/> Gandhi thus put herself forward as a leader with a pan-Indian vision.<ref name="Chandra 2007">{{Cite book| publisher = [[Penguin Books India]]

The programme became fully mature in 1974, when Dr. [[Raja Ramanna]] reported to Gandhi that India had the ability to test its first nuclear weapon.

==Views on women==
In 1952 in a letter to her American friend Dorothy Norman, Gandhi wrote: "I am in no sense a feminist, but I believe in women being able to do everything&nbsp;... Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once." While this statement appears paradoxical, it reflects Gandhi's complex feelings toward her gender and feminism.<ref name="Norman, Dorothy 1985">Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]], 1985. Print. 20.</ref> Her egalitarian upbringing with her cousins helped contribute to her sense of natural equality. "Flying kites, climbing trees, playing marbles with her boy cousins, Indira said she hardly knew the difference between a boy and a girl until the age of twelve."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jayakar|first1=Pupul|title=Indira Gandhi, a biography|date=1995|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-0140114621|page=265|edition=Rev.|url={{Google books|gm5JGkb2rhkC|page=PR9|keywords=feminist|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref><ref>Jayakar, Pupul.

Gandhi did not often discuss her gender, but she did involve herself in women's issues before becoming the prime minister. Before her election as prime minister, she became active in the organisational wing of the Congress party, working in part in the Women's Department.<ref name="auto1">Genovese, Michael A., ed.

And, as a woman, she naturally helped head the Women's section of the Congress Party. She often tried to organise women to involve themselves in politics.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://theprint.in/politics/indian-women-a-step-closer-to-breaking-glass-ceiling-in-politics/212444/ |title=Indian women a step closer to breaking glass ceiling in politics |last=Srivastava |first=Shruit |date=27 March 2019 |website=theprint.in |url-status=live |access-date=22 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226202029/https://theprint.in/politics/indian-women-a-step-closer-to-breaking-glass-ceiling-in-politics/212444/ |archive-date=26 February 2020 }}</ref> Although rhetorically Gandhi may have attempted to separate her political success from her gender, Gandhi did involve herself in women's organizations.

Even though men surrounded Gandhi during her upbringing, she still had a female role model as a child. Several books on Gandhi mention her interest in [[Joan of Arc]]. In her own accounts through her letters, she wrote to her friend Dorothy Norman, in 1952 she wrote: "At about eight or nine I was taken to France; Jeanne d'Arc became a great heroine of mine. She was one of the first people I read about with enthusiasm."<ref>Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 12.</ref> Another historian recounts Indira's comparison of herself to Joan of Arc: "Indira developed a fascination for Joan of Arc, telling her aunt, 'Someday I am going to lead my people to freedom just as Joan of Arc did'!"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: [[SAGE Publications]], 1993. Print. 107.</ref> Gandhi's linking of herself to Joan of Arc presents a model for historians to assess Gandhi. As one writer said: "The Indian people were her children; members of her family were the only people capable of leading them."<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: [[SAGE Publications]], 1993. Print. 131.</ref>

Gandhi's advocacy for women's rights began with her help in establishing the Congress Party's Women's Section.<ref name="auto1"/> In 1956, she wrote in a letter: "It is because of this that I am taking a much more active part in politics. I have to do a great deal of touring in order to set up the Congress Party Women's Section, and am on numerous important committees."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Gandhi spent a great deal of time throughout the 1950s helping to organise women. She wrote to Norman in 1959, irritable that women had organised around the communist cause but had not mobilised for the Indian cause: "The women, whom I have been trying to organize for years, had always refused to come into politics. Now they are out in the field."<ref>Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]], 1985. Print. 57.</ref> Once appointed president in 1959, she "travelled relentlessly, visiting remote parts of the country that had never before received a VIP&nbsp;... she talked to women, asked about child health and welfare, inquired after the crafts of the region"<ref>Jayakar, Pupul. Indira Gandhi: An Intimate Biography. New York: [[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]], 1992. Print. 112.</ref> Gandhi's actions throughout her ascent to power clearly reflect a desire to mobilise women{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}. Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. She saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that: "Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once."<ref name="Norman, Dorothy 1985"/>

Gandhi felt guilty about her inability to fully devote her time to her children. She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and "stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life."<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: [[SAGE Publications]], 1993. Print. 127.</ref> At another point, she went into more detail: "To a woman, motherhood is the highest fulfilment&nbsp;... To bring a new being into this world, to see its perfection and to dream of its future greatness is the most moving of all experiences and fills one with wonder and exaltation."<ref>Malhotra, Inder. Indira Gandhi: A Personal and Political Biography. Boston: [[Northeastern University Press]], 1989. Print. 55.</ref>

Her domestic initiatives did not necessarily reflect favourably on Indian women. Gandhi did not make a special effort to appoint women to cabinet positions.

After leading India to victory against Pakistan in the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] in 1971, President V. V. Giri awarded Gandhi with India's highest civilian honour, the [[Bharat Ratna]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Padma Awards Directory (1954–2007) |url=http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/PadmaAwards1954-2007.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Home affairs |access-date=26 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304070427/http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/PadmaAwards1954-2007.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2009 }}</ref><ref>Shankar, A.

Gandhi's main legacy was standing firm in the face of American pressure to defeat Pakistan and turn East Pakistan into independent Bangladesh.<ref name="ahsgjxajtu0c244"/> She was also responsible for India joining the group of [[countries with nuclear weapons]].<ref name= "Smiling Buddha"/> Despite India being officially part of the Non-Aligned Movement, she gave Indian foreign policy a tilt towards the [[Soviet bloc]].<ref name="British Academic Press"/>
In 1999, Gandhi was named "Woman of the Millennium" in an online poll organised by the BBC.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/543743.stm|title=BBC Indira Gandhi 'greatest woman'|work=BBC News|access-date=19 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010122338/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/543743.stm|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, she was ranked number seven on  ''[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook India's]]'' poll of [[the Greatest Indian]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/a-measure-of-the-man/281949 | title=A Measure of the Man}}</ref>

Being at the forefront of Indian politics for decades, Gandhi left a powerful but controversial legacy on Indian politics. The main legacy of her rule was destroying internal party democracy in the Congress party. Her detractors accuse her of weakening State chief ministers and thereby weakening the federal structure, weakening the independence of the judiciary, and weakening her cabinet by vesting power in her secretariat and her sons.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jannuzi|first1=F.

The Congress party was a "broad church" during the independence movement; however, it started turning into a family firm controlled by Indira Gandhi's family during the emergency. This was characterised by servility and sycophancy towards the family which later turned into a hereditary succession of Gandhi family members to power.<ref name="Bose2013">{{cite book|author=Sumantra Bose|title=Transforming India|url={{Google books|reiwAAAAQBAJ|page=PP8|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|date=16 September 2013|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0-674-72819-6|pages=28–29}}</ref>

One of her legacies is supposed to be the systematic corruption of all parts of India's government from the executive to the judiciary due to her sense of insecurity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=.
