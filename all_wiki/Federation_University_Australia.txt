'''Federation University Australia''' ('''Fed Uni''') is a public, [[Dual sector education|dual-sector]] university based in [[Ballarat]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. The university also has campuses in [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]], [[Rural City of Horsham|Horsham]], [[Stawell, Victoria|Stawell]], [[Churchill, Victoria|Churchill]], [[Berwick, Victoria|Berwick]], and [[Brisbane]], as well as online [[technical and further education]] (TAFE) courses and Horsham's Higher Education Nursing program.

Federation University is the fourth oldest tertiary education institution in Australia, having begun under predecessor institutions in 1870, during the [[Victorian gold rush]]. With the merger between the University of Ballarat and [[Monash University]]'s Gippsland campus in 2013, the university changed its name to Federation University from 2014.<ref>{{citation_needed|date=December 2016}}</ref><ref name="History">{{cite web | url=http://federation.edu.au/about-us/our-university/history|title=History | website=Federation University Australia| accessdate=26 November 2016 }}</ref><ref name="Courier 2013">{{cite web | url=http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/1600330/university-of-ballarat-to-become-federation-university-australia/ |title=University of Ballarat to become Federation University Australia |author=Tim Cowier | date=27 June 2013 | accessdate=26 November 2016 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:SMBcampusbuilding.jpg|thumb|right|The historic SMB Campus on Lydiard Street.]]

===1870–2013===
[[File:SMBcampus.jpg|thumb|right|SMB Campus on Lydiard Street South.]]
{{main|University of Ballarat}}
[[Tertiary education in Australia|Tertiary education]] at Ballarat began in 1870, making it Australia's fourth oldest tertiary institution.<ref name=UECA>{{cite web | url=http://www.ueca.edu.au/uni-university-ballarat.php | title=University of Ballarat | website=University English Centers Australia | access-date=26 November 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126200554/http://www.ueca.edu.au/uni-university-ballarat.php | archive-date=26 November 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

===2014–present===
On 6 September 2013, the [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Parliament]] passed legislation to establish Federation University Australia,<ref name="University of Ballarat becomes Federation University">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-06/university-of-ballarat-becomes-federation/4939744/|title=University of Ballarat becomes Federation University Australia|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> The name change officially began in 2014. The then Vice-Chancellor justified the name change as an attempt to broaden the reach of the university nationally and internationally, and in fairness to the campuses outside Ballarat.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2013/06/28/3791847.htm</ref> The name was also the preferred name within the university, compared to 'State University of Victoria', 'Eureka University', 'Robert Menzies University' or 'Vida Goldstein University'.

===Buildings and architecture===
The former [[Ballarat Gaol]], which was a maximum security prison that operated from 1862 until 1965, was located on the site of the university's School of Mines (SMB) campus, at the southern end of Lydiard Street. The area is known for being a well preserved Victorian era street.<ref>http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/156830/download-report</ref> While the prison was mostly demolished in the 1960s, the old prison walls, gate and guard towers, as well as the residences of the governor and warden, still exist. The Collaborative Research Centre in Australian History (CRCAH) is located in the governor's residence of the Old Ballarat Gaol. The CRCAH director's office was once the bedroom of Bella Guerin, who became the first woman to graduate from an Australian university in 1883.<ref>https://blogs.slv.vic.gov.au/such-was-life/bella-guerin-first-female-university-graduate-in-australia/</ref> The campus also includes the old School of Mines buildings.
