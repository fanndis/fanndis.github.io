The '''European Court of Human Rights''' ('''ECHR''' or '''ECtHR'''; {{lang-fr|Cour européenne des droits de l’homme}}), also known as the '''Strasbourg Court''',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Anagnostou |first1=Dia |title=European Court of Human Rights: Implementing Strasbourg's Judgments on Domestic Policy |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-7058-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DV2rBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA27 |language=en}}</ref> is a [[Supranationalism|supranational]] or [[international court]] of the [[Council of Europe]] which interprets  the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The court hears applications alleging that a contracting state has breached one or more of the [[human rights]] enumerated in the Convention or its optional protocols to which a member state is a party.

An application can be lodged by an individual, a group of individuals, or one or more of the other contracting states. Aside from judgments, the court can also issue advisory opinions. The convention was adopted within the context of the [[Council of Europe]], and all of its [[member states of the Council of Europe|47 member states]] are contracting parties to the convention. The court's primary means of [[judicial interpretation]] is the [[living instrument doctrine]], meaning that the Convention is interpreted in light of present-day conditions.

Several notable authors describe the ECHR as the most effective international human rights court in the world.<ref name="University of Pennsylvania Press">{{cite book |last1=von Staden |first1=Andreas |title=Strategies of Compliance with the European Court of Human Rights: Rational Choice Within Normative Constraints |date=2018 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-5028-2 |page=1 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Understanding the Binding Effect of">{{cite conference |last1=Ľalík |first1=Tomáš |title=Understanding the Binding Effect of the Case-Law of the ECtHR in Domestic Legal Order |conference=International Conference: Effectiveness of the European System of Protection of Human Rights |date=2011 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1951830}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author-link1=Laurence Helfer |last1=Helfer |first1=L.

==History and structure==
[[File:Piece of Berlin Wall in front of the European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|upright|A segment of the [[Berlin Wall]] in front of the European Court of Human Rights]]

On 10 December 1948, the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] which aims to promote the universal recognition of rights set out therein, in order to strengthen the protection of human rights at the international level.

On 5 May 1949, the Council of Europe was created in [[London]], the members of the Council consider that the UN Declaration seeks to ensure the universal and effective recognition and application of the rights set forth therein.

The court was established on 21 January 1959 on the basis of Article 19 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] when its first members were elected by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]. Initially, access to the court was restricted by the [[European Commission of Human Rights]], abolished in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=The court in brief|url=https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Court_in_brief_ENG.pdf|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|access-date=11 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="Bates" /> The court kept a low profile during its first years and did not accumulate much case law, first finding a violation in ''[[Neumeister v Austria]]'' (1968).<ref name=Bates>{{cite book |last1=Bates |first1=Ed |title=The Evolution of the European Convention on Human Rights: From Its Inception to the Creation of a Permanent Court of Human Rights |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-920799-2 |pages=179–180 }}</ref> The convention charges the court with ensuring the observance of the engagement undertaken by the contracting states in relation to the convention and its protocols, that is ensuring the enforcement and implementation of the European Convention in the member states of the Council of Europe.

==Member states ==
[[File:Council of Europe (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|[[Member states of the Council of Europe]]. In addition, the court's jurisdiction applies to the [[government of Kosovo]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Istrefi |first1=Kushtrim |title=Kosovo’s Quest for Council of Europe Membership |journal=Review of Central and East European Law |date=2018 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=255–273 |doi=10.1163/15730352-04303002 |language=en |issn=1573-0352}}</ref>]]
The jurisdiction of the court has been recognized to date by all 47 [[member states of the Council of Europe]]. On 1 November 1998, the court became a full-time institution and the [[European Commission of Human Rights]], which used to decide on admissibility of applications, was abolished by Protocol 11.<ref name="essentials">{{Cite book| last = Smith| first = Rhona K.M.| last2 = van der Anker| first2 = Christien| title = The essentials of Human Rights| publisher = Hodder Arnold| year = 2005| page = 115 | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/The_essentials_of_human_rights.html?id=BvR_QgAACAAJ| isbn =0-340-81574-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Details of Treaty No.155|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/155|website=Council of Europe|access-date=31 October 2017}}</ref>

The accession of new states to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] following the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 led to a sharp increase in applications filed in the court. The efficiency of the court was threatened seriously by the large accumulation of pending applications.

In 1999, 8,400 applications were allocated to be heard. In 2003, 27,200 cases were filed and the number pending rose to approximately 65,000. In 2005, the court opened 45,500 case files. In 2009, 57,200 applications were allocated, with 119,300 pending. At the time, more than 90 per cent of applications were declared to be inadmissible, and the majority of cases decided—around 60 per cent of the decisions by the court—related to what is termed ''repetitive cases'': where the court has already delivered judgment finding a violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] or where well established [[case law]] exists on a similar case.

Protocol 11 was designed to deal with the backlog of pending cases by establishing the court and its judges as a full-time institution, by simplifying the procedure and reducing the length of proceedings. However, as the workload of the court continued to increase, the contracting states agreed that further reforms were necessary and in May 2004, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted [[Protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights]].{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} Protocol 14 was drafted with the aim of reducing the workload of the court and that of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which supervises the execution of judgments, so that the court could focus on cases that raise important human rights issues.<ref name="proto14">{{cite web| title = Protocol no.14 Factsheet: The reform of the European Court of Human Rights| publisher = Council of Europe | date = May 2010| url = http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/57211BCC-C88A-43C6-B540-AF0642E81D2C/0/CPProtocole14EN.pdf| page = 1  | access-date = 25 September 2011 }}</ref>

== Judges ==
{{further|List of judges of the European Court of Human Rights}}
[[File:European Court of Human Rights, courtroom, 2014 (cropped).JPG|thumb|Courtroom of the European Court of Human Rights (detail)]]

Judges are elected for a non-renewable nine-year term.<ref name="proto14" /> The number of full-time judges sitting in the court is equal to the number of contracting states to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], currently 47. The convention requires that judges be of "high moral character" and have qualifications suitable for high judicial office, or be [[jurisconsult|jurists]] of recognised competence.

Each judge is elected by majority vote in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] from among three candidates nominated by each contracting state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://website-pace.net/en_GB/web/as-cdh |title=Main |publisher=Website-pace.net |access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref> Judges are elected whenever a sitting judge's term has expired or when a new state accedes to the convention. The retiring age of judges is 70, but they may continue to serve as judges until a new judge is elected or until the cases in which they sit have come to an end.

Judges perform their duties in an [[individual capacity]] and are prohibited from having any institutional or similar ties with the state in respect of which they were elected. To ensure the independence of the court, judges are not allowed to participate in activity that may compromise the court's independence. Judges cannot hear or decide a case if they have a familial or professional relationship with a party. A judge can be dismissed from office only if the other judges decide, by a two-thirds majority, that the judge has ceased to fulfil the required conditions. Judges enjoy, during their term as judges, the privileges and immunities provided for in Article 40 of the [[Statute of the Council of Europe]].<ref name="essentials" />

The European Court of Human Rights is assisted by a registry made up of around 640 agents, of which a little less than half of lawyers divided into 31 sections. The registry carries out preparatory work for the judges.<ref>[https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=court/howitworks&c= How the Court works]</ref>
, and performs the communication activities of the Court, with the applicants, the public and the press. The [[Registrar (law)|Registrar]] and the Deputy Registrar are elected by the Plenary Court.

==Plenary court and administration==
The plenary court is an assembly of all of the court's judges. It has no judicial functions. It elects the court's president, vice-president, registrar<ref>{{in lang|it}} Federico Di Salvo, [http://questionegiustizia.it/speciale/2019/1/lo-statuto-del-greffe-e-il-suo-ruolo-nel-processo-decisionale-della-corte_36.php ''Lo statuto del Greffe e il suo ruolo nel processo decisionale della Corte''], Questione giustizia, speciale n. 1/2019 (''La Corte di Strasburgo'' a cura di Francesco Buffa e Maria Giuliana Civinini).</ref> and deputy registrar. It also deals with administrative matters, discipline, working methods, reforms, the establishment of Chambers and the adoption of the Rules of Court.<ref name="essentials" />

The President of the Court, the two vice-presidents (also section presidents) and the three other section presidents are elected by the Plenary Court, Section presidents are elected by the Plenary Court, a formation made up of the 47 elected judges of the Court.The mandate of the holders is for a renewable period of three years. They are renowned for their morality and competence. They must be independent and there is incompatibility with other functions. They cannot be revoked by their State of origin, but only by decision of their peers, taken by a two-thirds majority and for serious reasons.<ref>[http://assembly.coe.int/nw/Committees/as-cdh/as-cdh-main-EN.asp Election of Judges to the European Court of Human Rights]</ref>

The president of the court for 2020 is the forty-eight-year-old [[Robert Spano]] from Iceland.<ref>[https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=court/judges Judges of the Court]</ref>

== Jurisdiction ==
The [[jurisdiction]] of the court is equivalent to the [[member states of the Council of Europe]], which is all European states except [[Belarus]], the [[Vatican City]], and the predominantly Central Asian [[Kazakhstan]]. The jurisdiction of the court is generally divided into inter-state cases, applications by individuals against contracting states, and advisory opinions in accordance with Protocol No.2. Applications by individuals constitute the majority of cases heard by the court.<ref name="essentials" /> A committee is constituted by three judges, chambers by seven judges, and a Grand Chamber by 17 judges.<ref name="essentials" />

===Applications by individuals===
Applications by individuals against contracting states, alleging that the state violates their rights under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], can be made by any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals. Although the official languages of the court are English and French, applications may be submitted in any one of the official languages of the contracting states. An application has to be made in writing and signed by the applicant or by the applicant's representative.<ref>Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.</ref>

Once registered with the court, the case is assigned to a judge rapporteur, who can make a final decision that the case is inadmissible. A case may be inadmissible when it is incompatible with the requirements of ''ratione materiae'', ''ratione temporis'' or ''ratione personae'', or if the case cannot be proceeded with on formal grounds, such as non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, lapse of the six months from the last internal decision complained of, anonymity, substantial identity with a matter already submitted to the court, or with another procedure of international investigation.

If the rapporteur judge decides that the case can proceed, the case is referred to a chamber of the court which, unless it decides that the application is inadmissible, communicates the case to the government of the state against which the application is made, asking the government to present its observations on the case.

The chamber of the court then deliberates and judges the case on its admissibility and its merits. Cases that raise serious questions of interpretation and application of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], a serious issue of general importance, or which may depart from previous [[case law]] can be heard in the Grand Chamber if all parties to the case agree to the chamber of the court relinquishing jurisdiction to the Grand Chamber. A panel of five judges decides whether the Grand Chamber accepts the referral.<ref name="essentials" /><ref name="proto14" />

===Interstate cases===
Any contracting state to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] can sue another contracting state in the court for alleged breaches of the convention, although in practice this is very rare.<ref name="essentials" /><ref>[https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Press_Q_A_Inter-State_cases_ENG.pdf ECHR Press Unit, Q & A on Inter-State Cases] (october 2020)</ref> Until now only four interstate cases have been decided by the court:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/InterState_applications_ENG.pdf |title=Inter-States applications |date=2019 |website=ECHR.coe.int |access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref>

===Advisory opinion===
The Committee of Ministers may, by majority vote, ask the court to deliver an advisory opinion on the interpretation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], unless the matter relates to the content and scope of fundamental rights which the court already considers.<ref name="essentials" />

===''Erga omnes'' effects===
ECtHR rulings  have ''[[erga omnes]]'' effects (that is, they are potentially binding on all member states), because the court "determines issues on public-policy grounds in the common interest, thereby extending human rights jurisprudence throughout the community of European Convention States", although ''erga omnes'' effect "is not regarded by all States Parties as a legal requirement".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Helfer |first1=Laurence R. |last2=Voeten |first2=Erik|author-link2=Erik Voeten |title=International Courts as Agents of Legal Change: Evidence from LGBT Rights in Europe |journal=International Organization |date=2014 |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=77–110 |doi=10.1017/S0020818313000398|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/2402/}}</ref>

[[File:Courtroom European Court of Human Rights 01.JPG|thumb|right|Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights]]

After the preliminary finding of admissibility the court examines the case by hearing representations from both parties. The court may undertake any investigation it deems necessary on the facts or issues raised in the application and contracting states are required to provide the court with all necessary assistance for this purpose.

The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] requires all hearings to be in public, unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying the holding of a private hearing. In practice the majority of cases are heard in private following written pleadings. In confidential proceedings the court may assist both parties in securing a settlement, in which case the court monitors the compliance of the agreement with the convention. However, in many cases, a hearing is not held.

The judgment of the Grand Chamber is final. Judgments by the chamber of the court become final three months after they are issued, unless a reference to the Grand Chamber for review or appeal has been made. If the panel of the Grand Chamber rejects the request for referral, the judgment of the chamber of the court becomes final.<ref name="essentials" /> The Grand Chamber is made up of 17 judges: the court's President and Vice-Presidents, the Section Presidents and the national judge, together with other judges selected by drawing of lots. Grand Chambers include a public hearing, which is [https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=hearings&c=#n1357300199863_pointer transmitted as a webcast on the ECHR site]. After the public hearing, the judges deliberate.

The court's chamber decides both issues regarding admissibility and merits of the case. Generally, both these issues are dealt with in the same judgment. In final judgments the court makes a declaration that a contracting state has violated the convention, and may order the contracting state to pay material and/or moral damages and the legal expenses incurred in domestic courts and the court in bringing the case.

The court's judgments are public and must contain reasons justifying the decision. Article 46 of the convention provides that contracting states undertake to abide by the court's final decision. On the other hand, advisory opinions are, by definition, non-binding. The court has to date decided consistently that under the convention it has no jurisdiction to annul domestic laws or administrative practices which violate the convention.

The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe is charged with supervising the execution of the court's judgments. The Committee of Ministers oversees the contracting states' changes to their national law in order that it is compatible with the convention, or individual measures taken by the contracting state to redress violations. Judgments by the court are binding on the respondent states concerned and states usually comply with the Court's judgments.<ref name="essentials" />

Chambers decide cases by a majority. Any judge who has heard the case can attach to the judgment a separate opinion. This opinion can concur or dissent with the decision of the court. In case of a tie in voting, the President has the casting vote.

==Just satisfaction==
The court may award [[pecuniary damages|pecuniary]] or [[non-pecuniary damages]], called "[[just satisfaction]]". The awards are typically small in comparison to verdicts by national courts and rarely exceed 1,000 euros.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=just satisfaction |website=Oxford Reference |language=en |doi=10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100027729}}</ref> Non-pecuniary damages are more closely correlated to what the state can afford to pay than the specific harm suffered by the complainant. In some cases, repeated patterns of human rights violations lead to higher awards in an effort to punish the responsible state, but paradoxically in other cases they lead to lower awards, or the cases being struck entirely.<ref name=Fikfak>{{cite journal |last1=Fikfak |first1=Veronika |title=Non-pecuniary damages before the European Court of Human Rights: Forget the victim; it’s all about the state |journal=Leiden Journal of International Law |date=2020 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=335–369 |doi=10.1017/S0922156520000035|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fikfak |first1=Veronika |title=Changing State Behaviour: Damages before the European Court of Human Rights |journal=European Journal of International Law |date=2018 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=1091–1125 |doi=10.1093/ejil/chy064|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Judicial interpretation==

===Margin of appreciation===
{{main|margin of appreciation}}
{{POV|section|date=September 2020}}
The ECtHR uses the doctrine of [[margin of appreciation]], referring to the member states' rights to set moral standards within reason. Over time, the court has narrowed the margin of appreciation (to the point of a "demise" of margin of appreciation).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gerards |first1=Janneke |title=Margin of Appreciation and Incrementalism in the Case Law of the European Court of Human Rights |journal=Human Rights Law Review |date=2018 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=495–515 |doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngy017|doi-access=free}}</ref>  Narrowing margin of appreciation is a target of criticism for those who believe that the ECtHR should minimize its role, especially from the United Kingdom.<ref name=McGoldrick>{{cite journal |last1=McGoldrick |first1=Dominic |title=A DEFENCE OF THE MARGIN OF APPRECIATION AND AN ARGUMENT FOR ITS APPLICATION BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE |journal=International and Comparative Law Quarterly |date=2016 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=21–60 |doi=10.1017/S0020589315000457}}</ref>

Proponents of a stronger recognition of margin of appreciation cite local conceptions of human rights, specific to the context of each country and its culture, and the risk of handing down judgements that lack local cultural and grassroots legitimacy.<ref name=Lemmens>{{cite book |last1=Lemmens |first1=Koen |title=Criticism of the European Court of Human Rights: Shifting the Convention System: Counter-dynamics at the National and EU Level |date=2016 |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=978-1-78068-517-5 |pages=23–40 |chapter=Criticising the European Court of Human Rights or Misunderstanding the Dynamics of Human Rights Protection?}}</ref> Critics argue that the principle of "emerging consensus" of the member states on which the ECtHR operates is fundamentally flawed, because such a consensus often relies on trends, and historically in many instances social and political consensus was retrospectively acknowledged to have been wrong. Such an approach is accused of risking to stigmatize and coerce the few dissenting countries, encouraging a [[pack mentality]]. Furthermore, critics argue that the ECtHR has claimed that such consensus exists even when objectively it did not, due to the judicial activism of its judges.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Consensus and Contestability: The ECtHR and the Combined Potential of European Consensus and Procedural Rationality Control|first=Thomas|last=Kleinlein|date=13 November 2017|journal=European Journal of International Law|volume=28|issue=3|pages=871–893|doi=10.1093/ejil/chx055|doi-access=free}}</ref> It has been said that in failing to distinctly define how a consensus is reached reduces its legitimacy. Furthermore, as the ECtHR grows, the consensus between the members diminishes.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023|last=Roffee |first=J. A. |year=2014 |title=No Consensus on Incest? Criminalisation and Compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights|journal=Human Rights Law Review |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=541–572 }}</ref>

However, the margin of appreciation doctrine has also come under sharp criticism from jurists and academics who say that it undermines the universal nature of human rights.<ref name=McGoldrick/>

==Relationship with other courts==

===European Court of Justice===
{{Main|Relationship between the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights}}

The [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] (CJEU) is not related to the European Court of Human Rights.

However, since all EU states are members of the Council of Europe and so are parties to the Convention on Human Rights, there are concerns about consistency in case law between the two courts. The CJEU refers to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and treats the Convention on Human Rights as if it were part of the EU's legal system{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} since it forms part of the legal principles of the EU member states.

Even though its member states are party to the convention, the European Union itself is not a party, as it did not have competence to do so under previous treaties. However, EU institutions are bound under Article 6 of the EU Treaty of Nice to respect human rights under the convention. Furthermore, since the Treaty of Lisbon took effect on 1 December 2009, the EU is expected to sign the convention. That would mean that the Court of Justice is bound by the judicial precedents of the Court of Human Rights's case law and so is subject to its human rights law, which would avoid issues of conflicting case law between these two courts.

However, to the surprise of many, an opinion issued in December 2014 by the CJEU had it reject accession to the European Court of Human Rights in [[Opinion 2/13]].

===National courts===
Most of the contracting parties to the European Convention on Human Rights have incorporated the convention into their own national legal systems, either through constitutional provision, statute or judicial decision.<ref>Helen Keller and [[Alec Stone Sweet]], [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199535262.do? ''A Europe of Rights: The Impact of the ECHR on National Legal Systems''] ([[Oxford University Press]], 2008).</ref> The ECtHR increasingly considers [[judicial dialogue]] with national courts to be a "high priority", especially when it comes to implementation of judgements.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Glas |first1=Lize R. |title=European Yearbook on Human Rights 2018 |date=2018 |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=978-1-78068-800-8 |pages=287–318 |chapter=The Boundaries to Dialogue with the European Court of Human Rights}}</ref>

In 2015, Russia adopted a law allowing it to overrule judgements from the ECtHR,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35007059|title=Russia moves to defy European court|date=4 December 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref> codifying an earlier Russian Constitutional Court decision which ruled that Russia could refuse to recognize an ECtHR decision if it conflicted with the [[Constitution of Russia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33521553|title=Russia may overrule European law|date=14 July 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref> and in 2020 Russia made [[2020 Russian constitutional referendum|constitutional amendments]] stipulating that the Russian Constitution supersedes international law. Other countries have also moved to restrict the binding nature of the ECtHR judgments, subject to the countries' own constitutional principles. In 2004, the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] of Germany ruled that judgments handed down by the ECtHR are not always binding on German courts.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thorsten Ader |url=https://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2004/10/article14.en.html |title=Germany: Binding Effect of Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights |publisher=Council of Europe |date=14 October 2004 |access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref>

A 2016 book characterizes Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Sweden to be mostly friendly to ECtHR judgements; France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey to be moderately critical; the United Kingdom to be strongly critical and Russia to be openly hostile.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Popelier |editor1-first=Patricia |editor2-last=Lambrecht |editor2-first=Sarah |editor3-last=Lemmens |editor3-first=Koen |title=Criticism of the European Court of Human Rights: Shifting the Convention System : Counter-dynamics at the National and EU Level |date=2016 |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=978-1-78068-401-7 |language=en}}</ref> In 2019, south Caucases states were judged partially compliant in a law review article.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Remezaite |first1=Ramute |title=Challenging the Unconditional: Partial Compliance with ECtHR Judgments in the South Caucasus States |journal=Israel Law Review |date=2019 |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=169–195 |doi=10.1017/S0021223719000049}}</ref>

Such a perspective appears to be one-sided. First of all, it is not clear on the basis of which criteria such a judgement should be made. Access to this Court is poor. As it has been stated in literature "[t]he Court´s statistics show a sustained and significant increase in the number of cases rejected at the filtering stage since the single judge procedure came into effect".<ref name=":0">See Steven Greer, Europe, in Daniel Moeckli et al. (eds.), International Human Rights Law, OUP: Oxford 2018, pp. 441-464.</ref>

The court lacks enforcement powers.

The number of non-implemented judgements rose from 2,624 in 2001 to 9,944 at the end of 2016, 48% of which had gone without implementation 5 years or more. In 2016, all but one of the 47 member countries of the Council of Europe had not implemented at least one ECtHR verdict in a timely fashion, although most non-implemented verdicts concern a few countries: Italy (2,219), Russia (1,540), Turkey (1,342), and Ukraine (1,172). More than 3,200 non-implemented judgements "concerned violations by security forces and poor detention conditions". Council of Europe [[Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[Nils Muižnieks]], stated: "Our work is based on cooperation and good faith. When you don't have that, it's very difficult to have an impact.

===Caseload===
[[File:ECHR backlog.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The backlog of pending cases has gone down from a peak of 151,600 in 2011, in part to streamlined rejection of applications at the admissibility stage.]]
The caseload of the court expanded rapidly after the fall of the Soviet Union, growing from fewer than 8,400 cases filed in 1999 to 57,000 in 2009. Most of these cases concern nationals of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] where there is less trust in the court system. In 2009, the court had a backlog of 120,000 cases which would have required 46 years to process at the previous rate, leading to reforms. According to the BBC, the court began "to be seen as a victim of its own success".<ref>{{cite news |title=Profile: European Court of Human Rights |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16924514 |access-date=29 August 2020 |work=BBC News |date=5 February 2015}}</ref>

Between 2007 and 2017, the number of cases dealt with each year was relatively constant (between 1,280 and 1,550); two-thirds of cases were repetitive and most concerned a few countries: Turkey (2,401), Russia (2,110), Romania (1,341), and Poland (1,272). Repetitive cases indicate a pattern of human rights violations in a given country.
