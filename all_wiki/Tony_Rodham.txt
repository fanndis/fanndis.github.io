'''Anthony Dean Rodham''' (August 8, 1954 – June 7, 2019) was an American consultant and businessman who was the youngest brother of [[Hillary Clinton]] and brother-in-law of former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]. His business dealings had sometimes appeared to take advantage of his connections to the Clintons and accordingly attracted public scrutiny.

==Career==
===Early career===
Rodham worked on future brother-in-law Bill Clinton's 1974 nomination campaign for [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]].<ref name="lh">[[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]], ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]'', [[Simon & Schuster]], 2003, {{ISBN|0-7432-2224-5}}, pp. 7, 73-74.</ref> He then worked at a metal equipment company in [[Texas]],<ref name="cnnbio" /> sold [[insurance]] in [[Chicago]], acted as a [[Repossession|repossessor]] in Chicago, where shots were fired at him in the infamous [[Cabrini–Green Homes|Cabrini–Green]] housing project,<ref name="cnn110199">Viveca Novak and Jay Branegan, [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/1999/10/25/brothers.html "Are Hillary's brothers driving off course?"], [[CNN]], November 1, 1999.

===1992–2006===
In 1992, during [[Bill Clinton]]'s first presidential campaign, Rodham began working for the [[Democratic National Committee]], coordinating constituency outreach.<ref name="cnnbio" />
In 1993, he and his brother Hugh ignited a small controversy when they tried to solicit corporate donations for Clinton's inaugural parties; they dropped the effort after a public outcry.<ref name="time012593">Priscilla Painton, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,977542-1,00.html "Guess Who's Paying for Dinner"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', January 25, 1993.

By 1994, Rodham had left his position at the Democratic National Committee<ref name="tnr072307">Keelin McDonell, [http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070723&s=mcdonell072307 "Oh Brother: The Return of the Rodhams"], ''[[The New Republic]]'', July 23, 2007.

In 1999, Rodham and his brother [[Hugh Edwin Rodham|Hugh Rodham]] entered into an $118 million venture to grow and export [[hazelnuts]] from the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]].<ref name="time022201">{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,100329,00.html | title=The Rumpled, Ragtag Career of Hugh Rodham | author=Jessica Reaves | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=February 22, 2002 | accessdate=March 26, 2006}}</ref> The [[U.S. State Department]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Sandy Berger]] became upset, however, when the Rodhams' local business connection in [[Batumi]] turned out to be [[Aslan Abashidze]], a major political opponent of Georgian President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], then a key U.S. ally in the region.<ref name="cnn110199" /><ref name="time022201" /> Moreover, Rodham flew to [[Rome]] to become [[godparent|godfather]] to Abashidze's grandson.<ref name="cnn110199" /> After initial resistance,<ref name="cnn110199" /> Berger and the Clintons prevailed upon the Rodham brothers to drop the deal.<ref name="time022201" /> Rodham would not state what his financial stake in the venture was.<ref name="cnn110199" />

Episodes such as these led Hillary Clinton's White House staff to refer to Rodham and his brother as "the Brothers Rodham",<ref name="nyt022301">Todd S.

In March 2001, it was revealed that Rodham had helped gain a March 2000 [[presidential pardon]] for Edgar Allen Gregory Jr., and his wife, Vonna Jo, a [[Tennessee]] couple in the [[Traveling carnival|carnival]] business who had been convicted of [[bank fraud]].<ref name="nyt030101">Marc Lacey, [[Don Van Natta, Jr.]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4D71F38F932A35750C0A9679C8B63 "Second Clinton In-Law Says He Helped to Obtain Pardon"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 1, 2001.

As of mid-2007, Tony Rodham was helping Hillary Clinton raise funds in [[Pennsylvania]] for her [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|2008 presidential campaign]].<ref name="tnr072307" /> By the end of 2007, he was back in the news for owing Nicole Boxer about $158,000 in back [[alimony]], child support, and related payments following a court judgement.<ref name="nyp122007">{{Cite news | author=Gregorian, Dareh | url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12202007/news/nationalnews/hills_brother_a_deadbeat_514395.htm | title=Hill's Brother a Deadbeat | newspaper=[[New York Post]] | date=December 20, 2007 | access-date=December 20, 2007}}</ref> This earned him renewed unfavorable publicity, including the headline "HILL'S BROTHER A DEADBEAT" in the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref name="mh-florida" /> In May 2008, he expressed disgust with how the [[Democratic National Committee]] was handling the [[2008 Michigan Democratic primary|Michigan]] and [[2008 Florida Democratic primary|Florida primary]] delegate issue between Clinton and [[Barack Obama]], and said he did not know who he would vote for if his sister were not nominated.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/05/hillary-clin-22.html | title=Hillary Clinton's brother is one unhappy camper | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=May 31, 2008 | access-date=June 1, 2008}}</ref>

By the early 2010s, after a string of unsuccessful ventures in oil and gas, water, housing, pharmaceuticals, and tutoring, Rodham was in financial distress, behind on his mortgage payments, facing home foreclosure, and being sued by his lawyer in the child support case for lack of payment.<ref name="nyt-2015" /> He said in a legal proceeding that while the Clintons had helped him in the past, including paying for his son's school tuition, that was over: "Hillary and Bill are done.
