The '''Supreme Court of the United States''' ('''SCOTUS''') is the [[Supreme court|highest court]] in the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal judiciary]] of the [[United States of America]]. It has ultimate (and largely [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States|discretionary]]) [[appellate jurisdiction]] over all [[Federal tribunals in the United States|federal]] and [[State court (United States)|state court]] cases that involve a point of [[Law of the United States|federal law]], and [[original jurisdiction]] over a narrow range of cases, specifically "all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party".<ref>U.S. Constitution, [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Original and appellate jurisdiction|Article III, Section 2]]. This was narrowed by the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] to exclude suits against states that are brought by persons who are not citizens of that state.</ref> The Court holds the power of [[Judicial review in the United States|judicial review]], the ability to invalidate a [[statute]] for violating a provision of the Constitution. It is also able to strike down [[presidential directive]]s for violating either the Constitution or [[statutory law]].<ref name=aboutSC>{{cite web| title=About the Supreme Court|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/about| publisher=[[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]]| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=September 3, 2018}}</ref> However, it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction. The Court may decide cases having political [[wikt:overtone#Noun|overtones]], but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide [[Justiciability|non-justiciable]] political questions.

Established by [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]], the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] through the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]]. As later set by the [[Judiciary Act of 1869]], the Court consists of the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] and eight [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|associate justices]]. Each justice has [[life tenure|lifetime tenure]], meaning they remain on the Court until they resign, retire, die, or are [[Impeachment in the United States|removed from office]].<ref>{{Cite web| last=Turley| first=Jonathan|title=Essays on Article III: Good Behavior Clause|url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/3/essays/104/good-behavior-clause| work=Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=September 3, 2018}}</ref> When a vacancy occurs, the president, with the [[Nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States|advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], appoints a new justice. Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it. When in majority, the chief justice decides who writes the [[opinion of the court]]; otherwise, the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion.

The Court meets in the [[United States Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Its law enforcement arm is the [[Supreme Court Police]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Supreme Court of the United States}}
It was while debating the [[separation of powers]] between the legislative and executive departments that delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|1787 Constitutional Convention]] established the parameters for the [[judicial branch|national judiciary]]. Creating a "third branch" of government was a novel idea; in the English tradition, judicial matters had been treated as an aspect of royal (executive) authority. Early on, the delegates who were opposed to having a strong central government argued that national laws could be enforced by state courts, while others, including [[James Madison]], advocated for a national judicial authority consisting of various tribunals chosen by the national legislature. It was also proposed that the judiciary should have a role in checking the executive's power to [[veto]] or revise laws. In the end, the [[Framers of the Constitution|framers]] compromised by sketching only a general outline of the judiciary, vesting federal judicial power in "one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish".<ref>{{Cite web| last=Pushaw Jr.| first=Robert J.| title=Essays on Article III: Judicial Vesting Clause|url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/3/essays/102/judicial-vesting-clause| work=Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=September 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| last=Watson| first=Bradley C.

The 1st United States Congress provided the detailed organization of a federal [[judiciary]] through the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Supreme Court, the country's highest judicial tribunal, was to sit in the [[Capital city|nation's Capital]] and would initially be composed of a chief justice and five associate justices. The act also divided the country into judicial districts, which were in turn organized into circuits. Justices were required to "ride circuit" and hold [[circuit court]] twice a year in their assigned judicial district.<ref name=SCinstitution>{{cite web| title=The Court as an Institution|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/institution.aspx| publisher=Supreme Court of the United States| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=September 3, 2018}}</ref>

Immediately after signing the act into law, President [[George Washington]] nominated the following people to serve on the 
court: [[John Jay]] for chief justice and John Rutledge, [[William Cushing]], [[Robert H. Harrison]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], and [[John Blair Jr.]] as associate justices. All six were confirmed by the Senate on September 26, 1789. Harrison, however, declined to serve. In his place, Washington later nominated [[James Iredell]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Supreme Court Nominations: present–1789|url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/nominations/Nominations.htm|publisher=Office of the Secretary, United States Senate|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}</ref>

Instead, these powers are entrusted to Congress, which initially established a six-member Supreme Court composed of a chief justice and five associate justices through the Judiciary Act of 1789. The size of the Court was first altered by an [[Midnight Judges Act|1801 act]] which would have reduced the size of the court to five members upon its next vacancy, but an [[Judiciary Act of 1802|1802 act]] promptly negated the 1801 act, legally restoring the court's size to six members before any such vacancy occurred. As the nation's boundaries grew, Congress added justices to correspond with the growing number of judicial circuits: [[Seventh Circuit Act of 1807|seven in 1807]], [[Eighth and Ninth Circuits Act of 1837|nine in 1837]], and [[Tenth Circuit Act of 1863|ten in 1863]].<ref>[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=12 ''Federal Judiciary Act (1789)''], [[National Archives and Records Administration]], retrieved September 12, 2017</ref>

In 1866, at the [[wikt:behest#Noun|behest]] of Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase|Chase]] and in an attempt to limit the power of [[Andrew Johnson]], Congress passed [[Judicial Circuits Act|an act]] providing that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced, which would thin the bench to seven justices by [[wikt:attrition#Noun|attrition]]. Consequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. In 1869, however, the [[Judiciary Act of 1869|Circuit Judges Act]] returned the number of justices to nine,<ref>{{usstat|16|44}}</ref> where it has since remained.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court in 1937. His proposal envisioned the appointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70{{nbsp}}years 6{{nbsp}}months and refused retirement, up to a maximum bench of 15 justices. The proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the [[Docket (court)|docket]] on elderly judges, but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to "pack" the Court with justices who would support Roosevelt's New Deal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mintz|first=S.|title=The New Deal in Decline|work=Digital History|publisher=University of Houston|year=2007|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=479|accessdate=October 27, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505032845/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=479|archivedate=May 5, 2008}}</ref> The plan, usually called the "[[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]]", failed in Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hodak|first=George|title=February 5, 1937: FDR Unveils Court Packing Plan|work=ABAjournal.com|publisher=American Bar Association|year=2007|url=http://abajournal.com/magazine/article/february_5_1937/|accessdate=January 29, 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, the Court's balance began to shift within months when Justice [[Willis Van Devanter]] retired and was replaced by Senator [[Hugo Black]].

===Nomination, confirmation, and appointment===
{{Main|Nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States}}

Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the [[United States Constitution]], known as the [[Appointments Clause]], empowers the [[President of the United States|president]] to nominate and, with the confirmation ([[advice and consent]]) of the United States Senate, to appoint public [[official]]s, including justices of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. This clause is one example of the system of checks and balances inherent in the Constitution. The president has the [[plenary power]] to nominate, while the Senate possesses the plenary power to reject or confirm the nominee. The Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice, thus a president may nominate anyone to serve, and the Senate may not set any qualifications or otherwise limit who the president can choose.<ref name=JOM222HGC>{{cite web| last=McGinnis| first=John O.| authorlink=John McGinnis| title=Essays on Article II: Appointments Clause|url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/91/appointments-clause| work=The Heritage Guide To The Constitution| publisher=Heritage Foundation| accessdate=June 19, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:SCOTUS appointment flowchart.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.05|Flowchart showing process of appointment of United States Supreme Court justices.]]
In modern times, the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups, which [[lobbying|lobby]] senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group's views. The [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report. The committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent. The first nominee to appear before the committee was [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] in 1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to [[Wall Street]], and the modern practice of questioning began with [[John Marshall Harlan II]] in 1955.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Nominations.htm| title=United States Senate. "Nominations"}}</ref> Once the committee reports out the nomination, the full Senate considers it. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected [[List of failed nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States|twelve]] Supreme Court nominees, most recently [[Robert Bork]], nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.

Although Senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative vote in committee to block a nomination, prior to 2017 a nomination could be blocked by [[filibuster]] once debate had begun in the full Senate. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s nomination of sitting Associate Justice [[Abe Fortas]] to succeed [[Earl Warren]] as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas's ethics. President [[Donald Trump]]'s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat left vacant by [[Antonin Scalia]]'s death was the second. Unlike the Fortas filibuster, however, only Democratic Senators voted against [[Cloture#United States|cloture]] on the Gorsuch nomination, citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy, and the Republican majority's prior refusal to take up President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|nomination of Merrick Garland]] to fill the vacancy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/sen-patty-murray-will-oppose-neil-gorsuch-for-supreme-court/|title=Sen. Patty Murray will oppose Neil Gorsuch for Supreme Court|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|first=Jim|last=Brunner|date=March 24, 2017| access-date=April 9, 2017|quote=In a statement Friday morning, Murray cited Republicans' refusal to confirm or even seriously consider President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, a similarly well-qualified jurist – and went on to lambaste President Trump's conduct in his first few months in office. [...] And Murray added she's "deeply troubled" by Gorsuch's "extreme conservative perspective on women's health", citing his "inability" to state a clear position on Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion-legalization decision, and his comments about the "Hobby Lobby" decision allowing employers to refuse to provide birth-control coverage.}}</ref> This led the Republican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 6, 2017|first=Matt|last=Flegenheimer|title=Senate Republicans Deploy 'Nuclear Option' to Clear Path for Gorsuch|quote=After Democrats held together Thursday morning and filibustered President Trump's nominee, Republicans voted to lower the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority.}}</ref>

Not every Supreme Court [[nominee#Noun|nominee]] has received a floor vote in the Senate. A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee; this occurred most recently with President George W. Bush's nomination of [[Harriet Miers]] in 2006. The Senate may also fail to act on a nomination, which expires at the end of the session. For example, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s first nomination of [[John Marshall Harlan II]] in November 1954 was not acted on by the Senate; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two months later. Most recently, as previously noted, the Senate failed to act on the March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland; the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was filled by Neil Gorsuch, an [[wikt:appointee|appointee]] of President Trump.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/nominations/Nominations.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Supreme Court Nominations, Present-1789|publisher=United States Senate| access-date=April 8, 2017}}</ref>

Once the Senate confirms a nomination, the president must prepare and sign a commission, to which the Seal of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] must be [[wikt:affix#Verb|affixed]], before the new justice can take office.<ref>''See'' {{usc|5|2902}}.</ref> The seniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date, not the confirmation or swearing-in date.<ref>{{usc|28|4}}. If two justices are commissioned on the same date, then the oldest one has precedence.</ref> The importance of commissioning is [[wikt:underscore#Verb|underscored]] by the case of [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. Although appointed to the court on December 19, 1869, by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and confirmed by the Senate a few days later, Stanton died on December 24, prior to receiving his commission. He is not, therefore, considered to have been an actual member of the court.

Before 1981, the approval process of justices was usually rapid. From the [[Harry Truman|Truman]] through [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administrations, justices were typically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the present, however, the process has taken much longer. Some believe this is because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past.<ref>{{cite web|last=Balkin|first=Jack M.|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/symposium-jc/balkin.php|title=The passionate intensity of the confirmation process|accessdate=February 13, 2008|publisher=Jurist|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218235804/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/symposium-jc/balkin.php|archivedate=December 18, 2007}}</ref> According to the [[Congressional Research Service]], the average number{{nbsp}}of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (or 2.3 months).<ref>{{cite news| title=The Stakes of the 2016 Election Just Got Much, Much Higher|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-supreme-court_us_56bfaee3e4b0c3c55051ad0c| work=[[The Huffington Post]]|access-date=February 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44234.pdf| title=Supreme Court Appointment Process: Senate Debate and Confirmation Vote| date=October 19, 2015| access-date=February 14, 2016| website=Congressional Research Service|last=McMillion| first=Barry J.}}</ref>

====Recess appointments====
When the Senate is in [[recess (motion)|recess]], a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies. [[recess appointment|Recess appointees]] hold office only until the end of the next Senate session (less than two years). The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving; of the two chief justices and eleven associate justices who have received recess appointments, only Chief Justice [[John Rutledge]] was not subsequently confirmed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1992| isbn=978-0-19-505835-2| editor-last=Hall| editor-first=Kermit L.| pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hall/page/965 965–971]| chapter=Appendix Two|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hall/page/965}}</ref>

No president since [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] has made a recess appointment to the Court, and the practice has become rare and controversial even in lower federal courts.<ref>See, e.g., Evans v. Stephens, 387 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 2004), which concerned the recess appointment of [[William H. Pryor, Jr.|William Pryor]]. Concurring in denial of certiorari, Justice Stevens observed that the case involved "the first such appointment of an Article III judge in nearly a half century" 544 U.S. 942 (2005) (Stevens, J., concurring in denial of cert) (internal quotation marks deleted).</ref> In 1960, after Eisenhower had made three such appointments, the Senate passed a "sense of the Senate" resolution that recess appointments to the Court should only be made in "unusual circumstances".<ref name="recessapp">{{cite journal| last=Fisher| first=Louis| date=September 5, 2001| title=Recess Appointments of Federal Judges|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL31112.pdf|journal=CRS Report for Congress|series=Congressional Research Service| volume=RL31112| page=16| quote=''Resolved'', That it is the sense of the Senate that the making of recess appointments to the Supreme Court of the United States may not be wholly consistent with the best interests of the Supreme Court, the nominee who may be involved, the litigants before the Court, nor indeed the people of the United States, and that such appointments, therefore, should not be made except under unusual circumstances and for the purpose of preventing or ending a demonstrable breakdown in the administration of the Court's business.|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}</ref> Such resolutions are not legally binding but are an expression of Congress's views in the hope of guiding executive action.<ref name="recessapp" /><ref>The resolution passed by a vote of 48 to 37, mainly along party lines; Democrats supported the resolution 48–4, and Republicans opposed it 33–0.</ref>

The Supreme Court's 2014 decision in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning]]'' limited the ability of the President to make recess appointments (including appointments to the Supreme Court); the Court ruled that the Senate decides when the Senate is in session (or in recess). Writing for the Court, Justice Breyer stated, "We hold that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-1281_mc8p.pdf|title=National Relations Board v. Noel Canning et al|pages=34, 35}} The Court continued, "In our view, however, the pro forma sessions count as sessions, not as periods of recess. We hold that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business. The Senate met that standard here." Later, the opinion states: "For these reasons, we conclude that we must give great weight to the Senate's own determination of when it is and when it is not in session. But our deference to the Senate cannot be absolute. When the Senate is without the capacity to act, under its own rules, it is not in session even if it so declares."</ref> This ruling allows the Senate to prevent recess appointments through the use of [[Pro forma#United States|pro-forma sessions]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/15/466849025/white-house-seems-to-rule-out-recess-appointment-to-replace-scalia|title=Obama Won't Appoint Scalia Replacement While Senate Is Out This Week|newspaper=[[NPR]]| language=en|access-date=January 25, 2017}}</ref>

===Tenure===
[[File:Inside the United States Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|alt=The interior of the United States Supreme Court|The interior of the United States Supreme Court]]

The Constitution provides that justices "shall hold their offices during good behavior" (unless appointed during a Senate recess). The term "good behavior" is understood to mean justices may serve for the remainder of their lives, unless they are [[Impeachment|impeached and convicted]] by Congress, [[Resignation|resign]], or [[Retirement|retire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How the Federal Courts Are Organized: Can a federal judge be fired?|url=http://www.fjc.gov/federal/courts.nsf/autoframe?OpenForm&nav=menu3c&page=/federal/courts.nsf/page/A783011AF949B6BF85256B35004AD214?opendocument|publisher=[[Federal Judicial Center]]. fjc.gov|accessdate=March 18, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915143136/http://www.fjc.gov/federal/courts.nsf/autoframe?OpenForm&nav=menu3c&page=%2Ffederal%2Fcourts.nsf%2Fpage%2FA783011AF949B6BF85256B35004AD214%3Fopendocument|archivedate=September 15, 2012}}</ref> Only one justice has been impeached by the House of Representatives ([[Samuel Chase]], March 1804), but he was acquitted in the Senate (March 1805).<ref>{{cite web| title=History of the Federal Judiciary: Impeachments of Federal Judges|url=http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/judges_impeachments.html| publisher=[[Federal Judicial Center]] fjc.gov| accessdate=March 18, 2012}}</ref> Moves to impeach sitting justices have occurred more recently (for example, [[William O. Douglas]] was the subject of hearings twice, in 1953 and again in 1970; and [[Abe Fortas]] resigned while hearings were being organized in 1969), but they did not reach a vote in the House. No mechanism exists for removing a justice who is permanently [[wikt:incapacitate#Verb|incapacitated]] by illness or injury, but unable (or unwilling) to resign.<ref name="hufpost">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/anticipating-the-incapaci_b_266179.html|title=Anticipating the Incapacitated Justice|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|date=August 22, 2009|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=August 23, 2009}}</ref>

Because justices have indefinite tenure, timing of vacancies can be unpredictable. Sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession, as in the early 1970s when [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.]] and William Rehnquist were nominated to replace [[Hugo Black]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II]], who retired within a week of each other. Sometimes a great length of time passes between nominations, such as the eleven years between [[Stephen Breyer]]'s nomination in 1994 to succeed [[Harry Blackmun]] and the nomination of John Roberts in 2005 to fill the seat of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] (though Roberts' nomination was withdrawn and resubmitted for the role of chief justice after Rehnquist died).

Despite the variability, all but four presidents have been able to appoint at least one justice. [[William Henry Harrison]] died a month after taking office, though his successor ([[John Tyler]]) made an appointment during that presidential term. Likewise, [[Zachary Taylor]] died 16 months after taking office, but his successor ([[Millard Fillmore]]) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Andrew Johnson, who became president after the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction in the [[#Size of the court|size of the court]]. [[Jimmy Carter]] is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice. Presidents [[James Monroe]], Franklin D. Roosevelt, and George W. Bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice, but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office. No president who has served more than one full term has gone without at least one opportunity to make an appointment.

===Retired justices===
There are currently three living retired justices of the Supreme Court of the United States: Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and [[David Souter]]. As retired justices, they no longer participate in the work of the Supreme Court, but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts, usually the [[United States Courts of Appeals]]. Such assignments are formally made by the chief justice, on request of the [[chief judge]] of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice. In recent years, Justice O'Connor has sat with several Courts of Appeals around the country, and Justice Souter has frequently sat on the [[First Circuit]], the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the Supreme Court.

The status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district court judge who has taken [[senior status]], and eligibility of a supreme court justice to assume retired status (rather than simply resign from the bench) is governed by the same age and service criteria.

In recent times, justices tend to strategically plan their decisions to leave the bench with personal, institutional, [[Ideology|ideological]], partisan and sometimes even political factors playing a role.<ref>David N. Atkinson, ''Leaving the Bench'' (University Press of Kansas 1999) {{ISBN|0-7006-0946-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/an-invisible-chief-justice/| title=An Invisible Chief Justice| last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|authorlink=Linda Greenhouse| date=September 9, 2010| work=[[The New York Times]]| quote=Had [O'Connor] anticipated that the chief justice would not serve out the next Supreme Court term, she told me after his death, she would have delayed her own retirement for a year rather than burden the court with two simultaneous vacancies. […] Her reason for leaving was that her husband, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, needed her care at home.|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref> The fear of mental decline and death often motivates justices to step down. The desire to maximize the Court's strength and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] through one retirement at a time, when the Court is in recess, and during non-presidential election years suggests a concern for institutional health. Finally, especially in recent decades, many justices have timed their departure to coincide with a philosophically compatible president holding office, to ensure that a like-minded successor would be appointed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Artemus|title=Deciding to Leave: The Politics of Retirement from the United States Supreme Court|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5651-4|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/decidingtoleavep00ward/page/358 358]|url=https://archive.org/details/decidingtoleavep00ward/page/358|quote=One byproduct of the increased [retirement benefit] provisions [in 1954], however has been a dramatic rise in the number of justices engaging in succession politics by trying to time their departures to coincide with a compatible president. The most recent departures have been partisan, some more blatantly than others, and have bolstered arguments to reform the process. A second byproduct has been an increase in justices staying on the Court past their ability to adequately contribute.[http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60710.pdf] p. 9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last2=Lindgren| first2=James| date=May 2010| title=Retirement and Death in Office of U.S. Supreme Court Justices| journal=[[Demography (journal)|Demography]]| volume=47| issue=2| pages=269–298| doi=10.1353/dem.0.0100|pmc=3000028| pmid=20608097| quote=If the incumbent president is of the same party as the president who nominated the justice to the Court, and if the incumbent president is in the first two years of a four-year presidential term, then the justice has odds of resignation that are about 2.6 times higher than when these two conditions are not met.| last1=Stolzenberg| first1=Ross M.}}</ref>

===Seniority and seating===
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}[[File:Supreme Court of the United States - Roberts Court 2018.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|The [[Roberts Court]] justices (October 6, 2018 to September 18, 2020):<br>Front row (left to right): Stephen Breyer, [[Clarence Thomas]], Chief Justice John Roberts, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] (since deceased), and Samuel Alito. Back row (left to right): Neil Gorsuch, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Brett Kavanaugh.]]

For the most part, the day-to-day activities of the justices are governed by rules of [[wiktionary:protocol|protocol]] based upon the [[seniority]] of justices. The chief justice always ranks first in the [[order of precedence]]—regardless of the length of their service. The associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service. The chief justice sits in the center on the bench, or at the head of the table during conferences. The other justices are seated in order of seniority. The senior-most associate justice sits immediately to the chief justice's right; the second most senior sits immediately to their left. The seats alternate right to left in order of seniority, with the most junior justice occupying the last seat. Therefore, starting in the middle of the October 2020 term, the court will sit as follows from left to right, from the perspective of those facing the Court: Kavanaugh, Kagan, Alito, Thomas (most senior associate justice), Roberts (chief justice), Breyer, Sotomayor, Gorsuch, and Barrett. Likewise, when the members of the Court gather for official group photographs, justices are arranged in order of seniority, with the five most senior members seated in the front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions, and the four most junior justices standing behind them, again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions.

In the justices' private conferences, current practice is for them to speak and vote in order of seniority, beginning with the chief justice first and ending with the most junior associate justice. By custom, the most junior associate justice in these conferences is charged with any menial tasks the justices may require as they convene alone, such as answering the door of their conference room, serving beverages and transmitting orders of the court to the clerk.<ref>See for example ''Sandra Day O'Connor:How the first woman on the Supreme Court became its most influential justice'', by [[Joan Biskupic]], Harper Collins, 2005, p. 105. Also ''Rookie on the Bench: The Role of the Junior Justice'' by Clare Cushman, Journal of Supreme Court History '''32''' no. 3 (2008), pp. 282–296.</ref> Justice [[Joseph Story]] served the longest as junior justice, from February 3, 1812, to September 1, 1823, for a total of 4,228 days. Justice Stephen Breyer follows very closely behind serving from August 3, 1994, to January 31, 2006, for a total of 4,199 days.<ref name="juniorjustice">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1199873130560| title=Breyer Just Missed Record as Junior Justice| accessdate=January 11, 2008}}</ref> Justice Elena Kagan comes in at a distant third serving from August 6, 2010, to April 10, 2017, for a total of 2,439 days.

===Salary===
{{Main|Federal judge salaries in the United States}}
As of 2018, associate justices receive a yearly salary of $255,300 and the chief justice is paid $267,000 per year.<ref name="salary">{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-compensation| title=Judicial Compensation| work=United States Courts| accessdate=May 15, 2017}}</ref> [[Compensation Clause|Article III, Section 1]] of the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from reducing the pay for incumbent justices. Once a justice meets [[United States federal judge#Retirement|age and service requirements]], the justice may retire. Judicial pensions are based on the same formula used for federal employees, but a justice's pension, as with other federal courts judges, can never be less than their salary at the time of retirement.

===Judicial leanings===
{{further|Ideological leanings of United States Supreme Court justices}}

Although justices are nominated by the [[US president|president]] in power, and receive confirmation by the [[US Senate|Senate]], justices do not represent or receive official [[Political endorsement|endorsements]] from political parties, as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches. [[Jurist]]s are, however, informally categorized in legal and political circles as being judicial conservatives, moderates, or liberals. Such leanings, however, generally refer to legal outlook rather than a political or legislative one. The nominations of justices are endorsed by individual politicians in the legislative branch who vote their approval{{clarify|believe it is only the US Senate that does this; not the entire legislative branch, which would include the House of Representatives and the Senate|date=October 2020}} or disapproval of the nominated justice. The ideologies of jurists can be measured and compared with several metrics, including the [[Segal–Cover score]], [[Martin-Quinn score]], and [[Judicial Common Space]] score.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hasen|first=Richard L.|date=2019-05-11|title=Polarization and the Judiciary|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051317-125141|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=261–276|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-051317-125141|issn=1094-2939|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Allison P.|last2=Sen|first2=Maya|date=2019-05-11|title=Bias and Judging|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051617-090650|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=241–259|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-051617-090650|doi-access=free|issn=1094-2939}}</ref>

Following the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in 2020, the Court currently consists of six justices appointed by Republican presidents and three appointed by Democratic presidents. It is popularly accepted that Chief Justice Roberts and associate justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett appointed by Republican presidents, compose the Court's conservative wing. Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and [[Elena Kagan|Kagan]], appointed by Democratic presidents, compose the Court's liberal wing. Gorsuch had a track record as a reliably conservative judge in the 10th circuit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/20/take-look-through-neil-gorsuchs-judicial-record.html| title=Take a look through Neil Gorsuch's judicial record|date=March 20, 2017| work=[[Fox News]]|first=Bill| last=Mears| quote=A Fox News analysis of that record – including some 3,000 rulings he has been involved with – reveals a solid, predictable conservative philosophy, something President Trump surely was attuned to when he nominated him to fill the open ninth seat.

Prior to Justice Ginsburg's death, Chief Justice Roberts was considered the Court's median justice (in the middle of the ideological spectrum, with four justices more liberal and four more conservative than him), making him the ideological center of the Court.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/chief-justice-roberts-recent-voting-record-downplays-notion-of-conservative-revolution-in-supreme-court|date=March 2, 2019|first=Bradford|last=Betz|work=[[Fox News]]|title=Chief Justice Roberts' recent votes raise doubts about 'conservative revolution' on Supreme Court|quote=Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told Bloomberg that Roberts' recent voting record may indicate that he is taking his role as the median justice "very seriously" and that the recent period was "perhaps the beginning of his being the swing justice."}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-kavanaugh-will-change-the-supreme-court/|first=Oliver|last=Roeder|work=[[FiveThirtyEight]]|date=October 6, 2018|title=How Kavanugh will change the Supreme Court|quote=Based on what we know about measuring the ideology of justices and judges, the Supreme Court will soon take a hard and quick turn to the right.

[[Tom Goldstein]] argued in an article in [[SCOTUSblog]] in 2010, that the popular view of the Supreme Court as sharply divided along ideological lines and each side pushing an agenda at every turn is "in significant part a caricature designed to fit certain [[wikt:preconception|preconceptions]]".<ref name=Goldstein2010>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/06/everything-you-read-about-the-supreme-court-is-wrong/| last=Goldstein| first=Tom| authorlink=Tom Goldstein| title=Everything you read about the Supreme Court is wrong (except here, maybe)|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|date=June 30, 2010|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}</ref> He pointed out that in the 2009 term, almost half the cases were decided unanimously, and only about 20% were decided by a 5-to-4 vote. Barely one in ten cases involved the narrow liberal/conservative divide (fewer if the cases where Sotomayor recused herself are not included). He also pointed to several cases that defied the popular conception of the ideological lines of the Court.<ref>Among the examples mentioned by Goldstein for the [[2009 term opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States|2009 term]] were:
* {{ussc|name=Dolan v. United States|560|605|2010}}, which interpreted judges' prerogatives broadly, typically a "conservative" result. The majority consisted of the five junior Justices: Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor.
* {{ussc|name=Magwood v. Patterson|561|320|2010}}, which expanded habeas corpus petitions, a "liberal" result, in an opinion by Thomas, joined by Stevens, Scalia, Breyer, and Sotomayor.
* {{ussc|name=Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins. Co.|559|393|2010}}, which yielded a pro-plaintiff result in an opinion by Scalia joined by Roberts, Stevens, Thomas, and Sotomayor.

Goldstein notes that in the 2009 term, the justice most consistently pro-government was Alito, and not the commonly perceived "arch-conservatives" Scalia and Thomas.</ref>
Goldstein further argued that the large number of pro-criminal-defendant [[Summary judgment|summary dismissals]] (usually cases where the justices decide that the lower courts significantly misapplied precedent and reverse the case without briefing or argument) were an illustration that the conservative justices had not been aggressively ideological. Likewise, Goldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of Congress, show inadequate deference to the political process, and be disrespectful of precedent, also lacked merit: Thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent (even if long standing) that he views as having been wrongly decided, and during the 2009 term Scalia and Thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation.

According to statistics compiled by SCOTUSblog, in the twelve terms from 2000 to 2011, an average of 19 of the opinions on major issues (22%) were decided by a 5–4 vote, with an average of 70% of those split opinions decided by a Court divided along the traditionally perceived ideological lines (about 15% of all opinions issued).

[[File:SCOTUS-oldsenate.jpg|thumb|From the 1860s until the 1930s, the court sat in the [[Old Senate Chamber]] of the [[U.S. Capitol]].]]

The Supreme Court first met on February 1, 1790, at the Merchants' Exchange Building in [[New York City]]. When Philadelphia became the capital, the Court met briefly in Independence Hall before settling in [[Old City Hall (Philadelphia)|Old City Hall]] from 1791 until 1800. After the government moved to Washington, D.C., the Court occupied various spaces in the [[United States Capitol]] building until 1935, when it moved into its own purpose-built home. The four-story building was designed by [[Cass Gilbert]] in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] and [[Library of Congress]], and is clad in marble. The building includes the courtroom, justices' chambers, an extensive [[law library]], various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services including a gymnasium. The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the [[Architect of the Capitol]], but maintains its own police force separate from the [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol Police]].<ref name=tws24oct204 />

==Jurisdiction==
[[File:Marbury v Madison John Marshall by Swatjester crop.jpg|thumb|Inscription on the wall of the Supreme Court Building from ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', in which Chief Justice John Marshall outlined the concept of judicial review]]

Congress is authorized by Article III of the federal Constitution to regulate the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has [[Original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States|original and exclusive jurisdiction]] over cases between two or more states<ref>{{USCSub|28|1251|a}}</ref> but may decline to hear such cases.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Liptak| first1=Adam| title=Supreme Court Declines to Hear Challenge to Colorado's Marijuana Laws|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/us/politics/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-challenge-to-colorados-marijuana-laws.html| accessdate=April 27, 2017| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=March 21, 2016}}</ref> It also possesses original but not exclusive jurisdiction to hear "all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, or vice consuls of foreign states are parties; all controversies between the United States and a State; and all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens".<ref>{{USCSub|28|1251|b}}</ref>

In 1906, the Court asserted its original jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for [[contempt of court]] in ''[[United States v. Shipp]]''.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=[[United States v.

In all other cases, however, the Court has only appellate jurisdiction, including the ability to issue [[writ of mandamus|writs of mandamus]] and [[writ of prohibition|writs of prohibition]] to lower courts. It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely; almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal. In practice, the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the Court are disputes between two or more states.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The Court's appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from [[United States courts of appeals|federal courts of appeal]] (through [[certiorari]], [[certiorari before judgment]], and [[Certified question#Certification of questions to the United States Supreme Court|certified questions]]),<ref>{{USC|28|1254}}</ref> the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] (through certiorari),<ref>{{USC|28|1259}}</ref> the [[Supreme Court of Puerto Rico]] (through certiorari),<ref>{{USC|28|1258}}</ref> the [[Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands]] (through certiorari),<ref>{{USC|28|1260}}</ref> the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] (through certiorari),<ref name="USC|28|1257">{{USC|28|1257}}</ref> and "final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had" (through certiorari).<ref name="USC|28|1257"/> In the last case, an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from a lower state court if the state's highest court declined to hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal. For example, a decision rendered by one of the [[Florida District Courts of Appeal]] can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court if (a) the [[Supreme Court of Florida]] declined to grant certiorari, e.g. ''[[Florida Star v. B. J. F.]]'', or (b) the district court of appeal issued a [[per curiam decision]] simply affirming the lower court's decision without discussing the merits of the case, since the Supreme Court of Florida lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Brannock| first1=Steven| last2=Weinzierl| first2=Sarah| title=Confronting a PCA: Finding a Path Around a Brick Wall| journal=[[Stetson University College of Law|Stetson Law Review]]| date=2003| volume=XXXII| pages=368–369, 387–390|url=http://www.stetson.edu/law/lawreview/media/confronting-a-pca-finding-a-path-around-a-brick-wall.pdf| accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref> The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts, rather than just federal courts, was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and upheld early in the Court's history, by its rulings in ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'' (1816) and ''[[Cohens v. Virginia]]'' (1821). The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions, although there are several devices that permit so-called "collateral review" of state cases. It has to be noted that this "collateral review" often only applies to individuals on death row and not through the regular judicial system.<ref>🖉{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html|title=Teague v.

Since Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain "cases" or "controversies", the Supreme Court cannot decide cases that are moot and it does not render [[advisory opinion]]s, as the supreme courts of some states may do. For example, in ''[[DeFunis v. Odegaard]]'', {{ussc|416|312|1974}}, the Court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit, and a decision from the Court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered. However, the Court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot. If an issue is "capable of repetition yet evading review", the Court will address it even though the party before the Court would not themselves be made whole by a favorable result. In ''Roe v. Wade'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}, and other abortion cases, the Court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court. Another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct, in which the Court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiff's need for relief.<ref>{{cite web| last1=Gutman| first1=Jeffrey| title=Federal Practice Manual for Legal Aid Attorneys: 3.3 Mootness|url=http://federalpracticemanual.org/chapter3/section3| website=Federal Practice Manual for Legal Aid Attorneys| publisher=Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law| accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref>

===Justices as circuit justices===
The United States is divided into thirteen [[United States court of appeals|circuit courts of appeals]], each of which is assigned a "circuit justice" from the Supreme Court. Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic, its meaning has changed through time.

Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, each justice was required to "ride circuit", or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges. This practice encountered opposition from many justices, who cited the difficulty of travel. Moreover, there was a potential for a conflict of interest on the Court if a justice had previously decided the same case while riding circuit. Circuit riding ended in 1901, when the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was passed, and circuit riding was officially abolished by Congress in 1911.<ref>{{cite journal

|quote="Gradually, however, circuit riding lost support. The Court's increasing business in the nation's capital following the Civil War made the circuit riding seem anachronistic and impractical and a slow shift away from the practice began. The Judiciary Act of 1869 established a separate circuit court judiciary. The justices retained nominal circuit riding duties until 1891 when the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was passed. With the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress officially ended the practice. The struggle between the legislative and judicial branches over circuit riding was finally concluded."}}</ref>

The circuit justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing with certain types of applications that, under the Court's rules, may be addressed by a single justice. These include applications for emergency stays (including stays of execution in death-penalty cases) and injunctions pursuant to the [[All Writs Act]] arising from cases within that circuit, as well as routine requests such as requests for extensions of time. In the past,{{when|date=September 2018}} circuit justices also sometimes ruled on motions for [[bail]] in criminal cases, writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and applications for [[writ of error|writs of error]] granting permission to appeal. {{cn span|Ordinarily, a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it "granted" or "denied" or entering a standard form of order. However, the justice may elect to write an opinion—referred to as an [[in-chambers opinion]]—in such matters if they wish.|date=September 2018}}

A circuit justice may sit as a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] of that circuit, but over the past hundred years, this has rarely occurred. A circuit justice sitting with the Court of Appeals has seniority over the chief judge of the circuit.

The chief justice has traditionally been assigned to the District of Columbia Circuit, the Fourth Circuit (which includes Maryland and Virginia, the states surrounding the District of Columbia), and since it was established, the [[Federal Circuit]]. Each associate justice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits.

As of November 20, 2020, the allotment of the justices among the circuits is as follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=Miscellaneous Order (11/20/2020) |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112020zr_8o6a.pdf |website=[[Supreme Court of the United States]] |accessdate=November 20, 2020}}</ref>

Six of the current justices are assigned to circuits on which they previously sat as circuit judges: Chief Justice Roberts (D.C. Circuit), Justice Breyer (First Circuit), Justice Sotomayor (Second Circuit), Justice Alito (Third Circuit), Justice Barrett (Seventh Circuit), and Justice Gorsuch (Tenth Circuit).

==Process==
{{Main|Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States}}

A term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October, and continues until June or early July of the following year. Each term consists of alternating periods of around two weeks known as "sittings" and "recesses". Justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings; they discuss cases and write opinions during recesses.

===Case selection===
Nearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of [[certiorari#United States law|certiorari]], commonly referred to as "cert". The Court may review any case in the federal courts of appeals "by writ of ''certiorari'' granted upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case".<ref>{{usc|28|1254}}</ref> The Court may only review "final judgments rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had" if those judgments involve a question of federal statutory or constitutional law.<ref>{{usc|28|1257}}; see also [[Adequate and independent state grounds]]</ref> The party that appealed to the Court is the ''[[petitioner]]'' and the non-mover is the ''[[Defendant|respondent]]''. All case names before the Court are styled ''petitioner'' v. ''respondent'', regardless of which party initiated the lawsuit in the trial court. For example, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state and against an individual, as in ''State of Arizona v. Ernesto Miranda''. If the defendant is convicted, and his conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the [[state supreme court]], when he petitions for cert the name of the case becomes ''Miranda v. Arizona''.

There are [[Original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States|situations where the Court has original jurisdiction]], such as when two states have a dispute against each other, or when there is a dispute between the United States and a state. In such instances, a case is filed with the Supreme Court directly. Examples of such cases include ''United States v. Texas'', a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas, and ''[[Virginia v. Tennessee]]'', a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court, and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval. Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of ''[[Georgia v. Brailsford (1794)|Georgia v.

Delaware]]'', and water rights between [[Riparian water rights#General_Principle|riparian]] states upstream of navigable waters in ''[[Kansas v. Colorado]]''.

A cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called a ''conference''. A conference is a private meeting of the nine Justices by themselves; the public and the Justices' clerks are excluded. The [[rule of four]] permits four of the nine justices to grant a writ of certiorari. If it is granted, the case proceeds to the briefing stage; otherwise, the case ends. Except in [[death penalty]] cases and other cases in which the Court orders briefing from the respondent, the respondent may, but is not required to, file a response to the cert petition.

The court grants a petition for cert only for "compelling reasons", spelled out in the court's Rule 10. Such reasons include:
* Resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or a provision of the federal Constitution
* Correcting an [[wikt:Egregious|egregious]] departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings
* Resolving an important question of federal law, or to expressly review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a previous decision of the Court.
When a conflict of interpretations arises from differing interpretations of the same law or constitutional provision issued by different federal circuit courts of appeals, lawyers call this situation a "circuit split". If the court votes to deny a cert petition, as it does in the vast majority of such petitions that come before it, it does so typically without comment. A denial of a cert petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case, and the decision of the lower court stands as the case's final ruling.

To manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the Court each year (of the more than 7,000 petitions the Court receives each year, it will usually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer), the Court employs an internal case management tool known as the "[[cert pool]]". Currently, all justices except for Justices Alito and Gorsuch participate in the cert pool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1129799113829| title=Roberts Dips Toe into Cert Pool| first=Tony| last=Mauro| work=[[ALM (company)|Legal Times]]| date=October 21, 2005| accessdate=October 31, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1144330162287| title=Justice Alito Joins Cert Pool Party| first=Tony| last=Mauro| work=Legal Times| date=July 4, 2006|accessdate=October 31, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/washington/26memo.html| title=A Second Justice Opts Out of a Longtime Custom: The 'Cert.

===Oral argument===
[[File:Waxman during Hyatt III sketch.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Seth P. Waxman]] at oral argument presents his case and answers questions from the justices.|alt=A man speaking at a [[lectern]] before two supreme court justices.]]
When the Court grants a cert petition, the case is set for oral argument. Both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case, as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition. With the consent of the parties or approval of the Court, ''[[amicus curiae|amici curiae]]'', or "friends of the court", may also file briefs. The Court holds two-week oral argument sessions each month from October through April. Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument (the Court may choose to give more time, though this is rare),<ref>For example, the arguments on the constitutionality of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] took place over three days and lasted over six hours, covering several issues; the arguments for ''Bush v. Gore'' were 90 minutes long; oral arguments in [[United States v. Nixon]] lasted three hours; and [[New York Times v. United States|the Pentagon papers case]] was given a two-hour argument. {{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2011/11/15/142363047/obamacare-will-rank-among-the-longest-supreme-court-arguments-ever|title='Obamacare' will rank among the longest Supreme Court arguments ever|last=Christy|first=Andrew|date=November 15, 2011|accessdate=March 31, 2011|publisher=NPR}} The longest modern-day oral arguments were in the case of [[California v.

The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some time to [[Rebuttal|rebut]] the respondent's arguments after the respondent has concluded. ''Amici curiae'' may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees. The Court advises counsel to assume that the Justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case.

===Supreme Court bar===
In order to plead before the court, an attorney must first be admitted to the court's bar. Approximately 4,000 lawyers join the bar each year. The bar contains an estimated 230,000 members. In reality, pleading is limited to several hundred attorneys. The rest join for a one-time fee of $200, earning the court about $750,000 annually. Attorneys can be admitted as either individuals or as groups. The group admission is held before the current justices of the Supreme Court, wherein the chief justice approves a motion to admit the new attorneys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridabar.org/divcom/jn/jnjournal01.nsf/Articles/0616A0059B6778BB85256ADB005D6106| title=Joining the Bar of the U.S. Supreme Court| publisher=Florida Bar Journal| work=Volume LXXI, No. 2| date=February 1997| accessdate=February 3, 2014| last1=Glazer| first1=Eric M.| last2=Zachary|first2=Michael|page=63}}</ref> Lawyers commonly apply for the cosmetic value of a certificate to display in their office or on their resume.

===Decision===
At the conclusion of oral argument, the case is submitted for decision. Cases are decided by majority vote of the Justices. It is the Court's practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular term by the end of that term. Within that term, however, the Court is under no obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral argument. At the conclusion of oral argument, the Justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied, and the most senior Justice in the majority assigns the initial draft of the Court's opinion to a Justice on his or her side. Drafts of the Court's opinion, as well as any [[concurring opinion|concurring]] or [[dissenting opinion]]s,<ref>''See generally'', [[Mark Tushnet|Tushnet, Mark, ed.]] (2008) ''I Dissent: Great Opposing Opinions in Landmark Supreme Court Cases'', Malaysia: Beacon Press, pp. 256, {{ISBN|978-0-8070-0036-6}}</ref> circulate among the Justices until the Court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case. Since recording devices are banned inside the courtroom of the Supreme Court Building, the delivery of the decision to the media is done via paper copies and is known as the [[Running of the Interns]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Kessler|first1=Robert|title=Why Aren't Cameras Allowed at the Supreme Court Again?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/03/case-allowing-cameras-supreme-court-proceedings/316876/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref><ref name="IJR 2016">{{cite web| last1=Johnson| first1=Benny| title=The 2016 Running of the Interns|url=http://ijr.com/2016/06/637664-the-2016-running-of-the-interns/| publisher=[[Independent Journal Review]]| accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>

It is possible that, through recusals or vacancies, the Court divides evenly on a case. If that occurs, then the decision of the court below is affirmed, but does not establish binding precedent. In effect, it results in a return to the ''[[status quo]] ante''. For a case to be heard, there must be a quorum of at least six justices.<ref name="28 USC 1">{{usc|28|1}}</ref> If a quorum is not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term, then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the Court had been evenly divided. For cases brought to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a United States District Court, the chief justice may order the case [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] to the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals for a final decision there.<ref>{{usc|28|2109}}</ref> This has only occurred once in U.S. history, in the case of ''[[United States v. Alcoa]]'' (1945).<ref>{{cite book| title=Industrial Organization: Contemporary Theory and Practice| last2=Richards| first2=Daniel L.| last3=Norman| first3=George| publisher=South-Western College Publishing| year=1999| location=Cincinnati| pages=11–12| last1=Pepall| first1=Lynne}}</ref>

===Published opinions===
The Court's opinions are published in three stages. First, a slip opinion is made available on the Court's web site and through other outlets. Next, several opinions and lists of the court's orders are bound together in paperback form, called a preliminary print of ''[[United States Reports]]'', the official series of books in which the final version of the Court's opinions appears. About a year after the preliminary prints are issued, a final bound volume of ''U.S. Reports'' is issued. The individual volumes of ''U.S. Reports'' are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports (or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher but containing parallel citations) to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily.

{{As of|2019|01}}, there are:
* Final bound volumes of ''U.S. Reports'': 569 volumes, covering cases through June 13, 2013 (part of the October 2012 term).<ref name="USRBV">{{cite web|title=Bound Volumes|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/boundvolumes.aspx|publisher=Supreme Court of the United States|accessdate=January 9, 2019}}</ref><ref name="USRv569">{{cite journal|title=Cases adjudged in the Supreme Court at October Term, 2012{{nbsp}}– March 26 through June 13, 2013|journal=United States Reports|date=2018|volume=569|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/boundvolumes/569bv.pdf|accessdate=January 9, 2019}}</ref>
* [[Slip opinion]]s: 21 volumes (565–585 for 2011–2017 terms, three two-part volumes each), plus part 1 of volume 586 (2018 term).<ref name=sliplists>{{cite web|title=Sliplists|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/sliplists.aspx|publisher=Supreme Court of the United States|accessdate=January 1, 2019}}</ref>

{{As of|2012|3|df=US}}, the ''U.S. Reports'' have published a total of 30,161 Supreme Court opinions, covering the decisions handed down from February 1790 to March 2012.{{citation needed|reason=is there a URL that can be added to the "as of" template?|date=October 2014}} This figure does not reflect the number of cases the Court has taken up, as several cases can be addressed by a single opinion (see, for example, ''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1|Parents v. Seattle]]'', where ''[[Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education]]'' was also decided in the same opinion; by a similar logic, ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' actually decided not only ''Miranda'' but also three other cases: ''Vignera v. New York'', ''Westover v. United States'', and ''California v. Stewart''). A more unusual example is [[The Telephone Cases]], which are a single set of interlinked opinions that take up the entire 126th volume of the ''U.S. Reports''.

Opinions are also collected and published in two unofficial, parallel reporters: ''[[Supreme Court Reporter]]'', published by [[West (publisher)|West]] (now a part of [[Thomson Reuters]]), and ''[[United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition]]'' (simply known as ''Lawyers' Edition''), published by [[LexisNexis]]. In court documents, legal periodicals and other legal media, case citations generally contain cites from each of the three reporters; for example, citation to ''Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission'' is presented as ''Citizens United v. Federal Election Com'n'', 585 U.S. 50, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010), with "S. Ct." representing the ''Supreme Court Reporter'', and "L. Ed." representing the ''Lawyers' Edition''.<ref>{{cite web| title=Supreme Court Research Guide|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/library/research/guides/supreme_court.cfm| work=law.georgetown.edu| publisher=Georgetown Law Library| accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=How to Cite Cases: U.S. Supreme Court Decisions|url=http://lib.guides.umd.edu/content.php?pid=128265&sid=1100770| work=lib.guides.umd.edu| publisher=[[University of Maryland]] University Libraries| accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref>

====Citations to published opinions====
{{further|Case citation#Supreme Court of the United States}}
Lawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases, in the form "{{varserif|vol}} U.S. {{varserif|page}}, {{varserif|pin}} ({{varserif|year}})", where {{varserif|vol}} is the volume number, {{varserif|page}} is the page number on which the opinion begins, and {{varserif|year}} is the year in which the case was decided. Optionally, {{varserif|pin}} is used to "pinpoint" to a specific page number within the opinion. For instance, the citation for ''Roe v. Wade'' is 410 U.S. 113 (1973), which means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410 of ''U.S. Reports''. For opinions or orders that have not yet been published in the preliminary print, the volume and page numbers may be replaced with "___".

==Institutional powers and constraints==
The Federal court system and the judicial authority to interpret the Constitution received little attention in the debates over the drafting and ratification of the Constitution. The power of [[judicial review]], in fact, is nowhere mentioned in it. Over the ensuing years, the question of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the drafters of the Constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either way.<ref name="google118"/> Nevertheless, the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well-established precedent. Many of the [[Founding Fathers]] accepted the notion of judicial review; in [[Federalist No. 78]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] wrote: "A Constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute."

The Supreme Court firmly established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803), consummating the American system of [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]]. In explaining the power of judicial review, Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] stated that the authority to interpret the law was the particular province of the courts, part of the ''duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.'' His contention was not that the Court had privileged insight into constitutional requirements, but that it was the constitutional duty of the judiciary, as well as the other branches of government, to read and obey the dictates of the Constitution.<ref name="google118">{{cite book| title=Institutions of American Democracy: The Judicial Branch| year=2005| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=New York City| isbn=978-0-19-530917-1| pages=117–118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rWCaMAdUzgC&q=Institutions+of+American+Democracy%3A+The+Judicial+Branch| editor1-first=Kermit L.| editor1-last=Hall| editor2-first=Kevin T.| editor2-last=McGuire}}</ref>

Since the founding of the republic, there has been a tension between the practice of judicial review and the [[democratic ideals]] of [[Equality before the law|egalitarianism]], self-government, self-determination and freedom of conscience. At one pole are those who view the Federal Judiciary and especially the Supreme Court as being "the most separated and least checked of all branches of government".<ref>{{cite book| last=Mendelson| first=Wallace| year=1992| contribution=Separation of Powers| editor-last=Hall| editor-first=Kermit L.| editor-link=Kermit L. Hall| title=The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States| publisher=Oxford University Press| page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hall/page/775 775]| isbn=978-0-19-505835-2|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hall/page/775}}</ref> Indeed, federal judges and justices on the Supreme Court are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure "during good behavior", and their pay may "not be diminished" while they hold their position ([[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Section 1: Federal courts|Section 1 of Article Three]]). Though subject to the process of impeachment, only one Justice has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court Justice has been removed from office. At the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch, with little ability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government.<ref name="google118" />

The Supreme Court, it is noted, cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments. One notable instance of [[nonacquiescence]] came in 1832, when the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] ignored the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]''. President [[Andrew Jackson]], who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have remarked, "[[John Marshall]] has made his decision; now let him enforce it!";<ref>The American Conflict by Horace Greeley (1873), p. 106; also in The Life of Andrew Jackson (2001) by Robert Vincent Remini</ref> {{cns|date=July 2019|text=however, this alleged quotation has been disputed.}} Some state governments in the [[Southern United States|South]] also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment ''Brown v. Board of Education''. More recently, many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the Court's order in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'' (1974) to surrender the [[Watergate tapes]].<ref>{{cite news|date=July 8, 1974|title=Supreme Court hears case of United States v. Nixon|url=http://highered.nbclearn.com/portal/site/HigherEd/flatview?cuecard=3733|access-date=February 20, 2019|last1=Brokaw|first1=Tom|last2=Stern|first2=Carl|publisher=NBC Universal Media LLC|quote=" But there is no guarantee that when the decision comes, it will end the matter. It may just set the stage for the next legal wrangle over compliance with the Court's decision."}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Nixon, however, ultimately complied with the Supreme Court's ruling.

Supreme Court decisions can be (and have been) purposefully overturned by constitutional amendment, which has happened on five occasions:
* ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'' (1793) – overturned by the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] (1795)
* ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857) – overturned by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] (1865) and the Fourteenth Amendment (1868)
* ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]'' (1895) – overturned by the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] (1913)
* ''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'' (1875) – overturned by the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] (1920)
* ''[[Oregon v. Mitchell]]'' (1970) – overturned by the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] (1971)

When the Court rules on matters involving the interpretation of laws rather than of the Constitution, simple legislative action can reverse the decisions (for example, in 2009 Congress passed the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009|Lilly Ledbetter act]], superseding the limitations given in ''[[Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.]]'' in 2007). Also, the Supreme Court is not immune from political and institutional consideration: lower federal courts and state courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations, as do law enforcement officials.<ref>{{cite book| last=Vile| first=John R.| year=1992| contribution=Court curbing| editor-last=Hall| editor-first=Kermit L.| editor-link=Kermit L. Hall| title=The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States| publisher=Oxford University Press| page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hall/page/202 202]| isbn=978-0-19-505835-2|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hall/page/202}}</ref>

In addition, the other two branches can restrain the Court through other mechanisms. Congress can increase the number of justices, giving the President power to influence future decisions by appointments (as in Roosevelt's Court Packing Plan discussed above). Congress can pass legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other federal courts over certain topics and cases: this is suggested by language in [[Article 3 (U.S. Constitution)#Section 2: Federal jurisdiction and trial by jury|Section 2]] of Article Three, where the appellate jurisdiction is granted ''"with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make."'' The Court sanctioned such congressional action in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] case ''[[ex parte McCardle]]'' (1869), though it rejected Congress' power to dictate how particular cases must be decided in ''[[United States v. Klein]]'' (1871).

On the other hand, through its power of judicial review, the Supreme Court has defined the scope and nature of the powers and separation between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government; for example, in ''[[United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.]]'' (1936), ''[[Dames & Moore v. Regan]]'' (1981), and notably in ''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]'' (1979), (where it effectively gave the Presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of Congress). The Court's decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of Executive authority, as in ''[[Humphrey's Executor v. United States]]'' (1935), the ''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer|Steel Seizure Case]]'' (1952), and ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'' (1974).<!-- There are a lot of other cases worth mentioning, but on the other hand too much detail might be inappropriate here.-->

Coleman, Jr.]], was hired in 1948 by Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]].<ref name=Peppers2006 /> A disproportionately large number of law clerks have obtained law degrees from elite law schools, especially Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, Columbia, and Stanford. From 1882 to 1940, 62% of law clerks were graduates of Harvard Law School.<ref name=Peppers2006 /> Those chosen to be Supreme Court law clerks usually have graduated in the top of their law school class and were often an editor of the [[law review]] or a member of the [[moot court]] board. By the mid-1970s, clerking previously for a judge in a [[United States Courts of Appeals|federal court of appeals]] had also become a prerequisite to clerking for a Supreme Court justice.<ref>[[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States]]</ref>

Nine Supreme Court justices previously clerked for other justices: [[Byron White]] for [[Frederick M. Vinson]], [[John Paul Stevens]] for [[Wiley Rutledge]], [[William Rehnquist]] for [[Robert H. Jackson]], Stephen Breyer for [[Arthur Goldberg]], John Roberts for William Rehnquist, Elena Kagan for [[Thurgood Marshall]], Neil Gorsuch for both Byron White and [[Anthony Kennedy]], Brett Kavanaugh also for Kennedy, and Amy Coney Barrett for [[Antonin Scalia]]. Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh served under Kennedy during the same term. Gorsuch is the first justice to serve alongside a justice for whom he or she clerked, serving alongside Kennedy from April 2017 through Kennedy's retirement in 2018. With the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh, for the first time a majority of the Supreme Court was composed of former Supreme Court law clerks (Roberts, Breyer, Kagan, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, now joined by Barrett).

Several current Supreme Court justices have also clerked in the federal courts of appeals: John Roberts for Judge [[Henry Friendly]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], Justice [[Samuel Alito]] for Judge [[Leonard I. Garth]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]], Elena Kagan for Judge [[Abner J. Mikva]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], [[Neil Gorsuch]] for Judge [[David B. Sentelle]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]], Brett Kavanaugh for Judge [[Walter King Stapleton|Walter Stapleton]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] and Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], and Amy Coney Barrett for Judge [[Laurence Silberman]] of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]]. 

===Politicization of the Court===

Clerks hired by each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft. "Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a [[wikt:nonpartisan|nonpartisan]] institution from the 1940s into the 1980s," according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of Vanderbilt University Law School.<ref name=nyt090710>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/us/politics/07clerks.html|title=Polarization of Supreme Court Is Reflected in Justices' Clerks|first=Adam|last=Liptak|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 7, 2010|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/articles/2009/11/Nelson-et-al.-Supreme-Court-Clerkships-62-Vand.-L.-Rev.-1749-2009.pdf|title=The Liberal Tradition of the Supreme Court Clerkship: Its Rise, Fall, and Reincarnation?|author1=William E.

Michael Luttig]] said.<ref name=nyt090710 /> [[David J. Garrow]], professor of history at the [[University of Cambridge]], stated that the Court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government. "We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House of Representatives," Professor Garrow said. "Each side is putting forward only ideological purists."<ref name=nyt090710 />

According to the ''Vanderbilt Law Review'' study, this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is "a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law".<ref name=nyt090710 /> A poll conducted in June 2012 by ''The New York Times'' and CBS News showed just 44% of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing. Three-quarters said justices' decisions are sometimes influenced by their political or personal views.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|last2=Kopicki|first2=Allison|title=Approval Rating for Supreme Court Hits Just 44% in Poll|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 7, 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/us/politics/44-percent-of-americans-approve-of-supreme-court-in-new-poll.html|access-date=June 28, 2019}}</ref>

==Criticism==
The Supreme Court has been the object of criticisms on a range of issues. Among them:

===Judicial activism===
The Supreme Court has been criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by engaging in [[judicial activism]], rather than merely interpreting law and exercising [[judicial restraint]]. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology.<ref name="judicialactivismOxford">See for example "Judicial activism" in ''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'', edited by Kermit Hall; article written by Gary McDowell</ref> An often cited example of [[conservatism|conservative]] judicial activism is the 1905 decision in ''[[Lochner v.

An often cited example of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] judicial activism is ''[[Roe v.

===Courts are a poor check on executive power===
British constitutional scholar [[Adam Tomkins]] sees flaws in the American system of having courts (and specifically the Supreme Court) act as checks on the Executive and Legislative branches; he argues that because the courts must wait, sometimes for years, for cases to navigate their way through the system, their ability to restrain other branches is severely weakened.<ref name="tws23oct77">{{cite journal|url=http://reviewcanada.ca/essays/2008/11/01/our-canadian-republic/|title=Our Canadian Republic – Do we display too much deference to authority … or not enough?|date=November 1, 2008|journal=Literary Review of Canada|author=Christopher Moore| accessdate=October 23, 2009|author-link=Christopher Moore (Canadian historian)}}</ref><ref name=tws2nov02>{{cite news|title=In Defence of the Political Constitution|first=Adam|last=Tomkins|publisher=22 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 157|location=United Kingdom|year=2002|quote=Bush v.

The Court has been criticized for giving the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal government]] too much power to interfere with state authority. One criticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the [[Commerce Clause]] by upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce, but that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce; and by voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce. For example, the Commerce Clause was used by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the Endangered Species Act, thus protecting six endemic species of insect near Austin, Texas, despite the fact that the insects had no commercial value and did not travel across state lines; the Supreme Court let that ruling stand without comment in 2005.<ref name=tws30oct08>{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Gold|title=Justices Swat Down Texans' Effort to Weaken Species Protection Law|quote=Purcell filed a $60-million lawsuit against the U.S. government in 1999, arguing that cave bugs could not be regulated through the commerce clause because they had no commercial value and did not cross state lines.

Advocates of [[states' rights]] such as constitutional scholar [[Kevin Gutzman]] have also criticized the Court, saying it has misused the Fourteenth Amendment to undermine state authority.

===Secretive proceedings===
The Court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view.<ref name=tws23oct02>{{cite news|first=James|last=Vicini|title=Justice Scalia defends Bush v.

It all works very neatly; the only ones hurt are the American people, who know little about nine individuals with enormous power over their lives."<ref name=tws23oct12 /> [[Larry Sabato]] complains about the Court's "insularity".<ref name="tws23oct16" /> A [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] poll conducted in 2010 found that 61% of American voters agreed that [[Cameras in the Supreme Court of the United States|televising Court hearings]] would "be good for democracy", and 50% of voters stated they would watch Court proceedings if they were televised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicmind.fdu.edu/courttv/|title=Public Says Televising Court Is Good for Democracy|work=PublicMind.fdu.edu|date=March 9, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202445941834|title=Poll Shows Public Support for Cameras at the High Court|last=Mauro|first=Tony|work=[[The National Law Journal]]|date=March 9, 2010|accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref> More recently, several justices have appeared on television, written books and made public statements to journalists.<ref name="CSPAN SCW">{{cite web|publisher=CSPAN|title=C-SPAN Supreme Court Week|date=October 4, 2009|accessdate=October 25, 2009|url=http://supremecourt.c-span.org}}</ref><ref name=tws23oct03>{{cite news|first=James|last=Vicini|title=Justice Scalia defends Bush v.

===Judicial interference in political disputes===
Some Court decisions have been criticized for injecting the Court into the political arena, and deciding questions that are the purview of the other two branches of government. The ''Bush v. Gore'' decision, in which the Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election and effectively chose [[George W. Bush]] over [[Al Gore]], has been criticized extensively, particularly by liberals.<ref name="tws23oct12">{{cite news|first=David|last=Margolick|title=Meet the Supremes|quote=Beat reporters and academics initially denounced the court's involvement in that case, its hastiness to enter the political thicket and the half-baked and strained decision that resulted.|work=The New York Times|date=September 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/books/review/Margolick-t.html|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}</ref><ref name=tws23oct07>{{cite news|first=David G.|last=Savage|title=Roe vs. Wade?

===Not choosing enough cases to review===
Senator [[Arlen Specter]] said the Court should "decide more cases".<ref name="tws22oct11" /> On the other hand, although Justice [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]] acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of cases that the Court heard then was smaller than when he first joined the Supreme Court, he also stated that he had not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case, nor did he believe his colleagues had changed their standards. He attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s, at least in part, to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts.<ref name="CSPAN SCW" />
