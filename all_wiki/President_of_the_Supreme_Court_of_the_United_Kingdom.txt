The '''President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom''' is equivalent to the now-defunct position of '''Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary''', also known as the '''Senior Law Lord''', who was the highest ranking among the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] (the judges who exercised the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]]). The President is not the most senior judge of the judiciary in England and Wales; that position belongs to the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]].

The current President is [[Robert Reed, Lord Reed|'''Robert Reed''']], since 13 January 2020<ref>Supreme Court website: [https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/biographies-of-the-justices.html Biographies of the Justices]</ref>.

==History==
From 1900 to 1969, when the [[Lord Chancellor]] was not present, a former Lord Chancellor would preside at [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judicial sittings of the House of Lords]]. If no former Lord Chancellor was present, the most senior [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary]] present would preside, seniority being determined by rank in the peerage. In the years following World War II, it became less common for Lord Chancellors to have time to gain judicial experience in office, making it anomalous for former holders of the office to take precedence. As a result, on 22 May 1969, the rules were changed such that if the Lord Chancellor was not present (as was normally the case), the most senior Law Lord, by appointment as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary rather than peerage, would preside.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1969/may/22/judicial-sittings House of Lords Debates 22 May 1969 c 468–71].</ref>

In 1984, the system was amended to provide that judges be appointed as Senior and Second Senior Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, rather than taking the roles by seniority. The purpose of the change was to allow an ailing [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] to step aside from presiding, yet remain a Law Lord.<ref name="diplock"/>

On 1 October 2009, the judicial functions of the House of Lords were transferred to the new Supreme Court under the provisions of the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]]. The Senior Law Lord, [[Nick Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers|Nick Phillips]], and the Second Senior Law Lord became, respectively, the President and the Deputy President of the new court. The same day, the Queen by warrant established a place for the President of the Supreme Court in the [[United Kingdom order of precedence|order of precedence]], immediately after the [[Lord Speaker]] (the Speaker of the House of Lords).
