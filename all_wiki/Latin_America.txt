'''Latin America'''{{efn|name=a}} is a group of countries and dependencies in the [[Western Hemisphere]] where [[Romance languages]] such as [[Spanish language in the Americas|Spanish]], [[American Portuguese|Portuguese]], and [[French language|French]] are predominantly spoken. Some territories such as [[Quebec]], where [[American French|French]] is spoken, or areas of the [[United States]] where Spanish is predominantly spoken are not included due to the country being a part of [[Anglo America]]. The term is broader than categories such as [[Hispanic America]] which specifically refers to Spanish-speaking countries or [[Ibero-America]] which specifically refers to both Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries. The term is also more recent in origin.

The term "Latin America" was first used in an 1856 conference with the title "Initiative of America. Idea for a Federal Congress of the Republics" (Iniciativa de la América. Idea de un Congreso Federal de las Repúblicas),<ref name="bilbao f">{{cite web |last1=Bilbao |first1=Francisco |title=Iniciativa de la América.

The term was further popularised by French emperor [[Napoleon III]]'s government in the 1860s as ''Amérique latine'' to justify France's military involvement in Mexico and try to include [[Francophonie|French-speaking]] territories in the Americas such as [[French Canada]], [[French Louisiana]], or [[French Guiana]], in the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed.<ref name="Britton" />

Including French-speaking territories, Latin America would consist of 20 countries and 14 dependent territories that cover an area that stretches from Mexico to [[Tierra del Fuego]] and includes much of the [[Caribbean]]. It has an area of approximately 19,197,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}} (7,412,000&nbsp;sq mi),<ref name=worldbank-ruralenv>{{cite web| url  =  http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.1 | title = World Development Indicators: Rural environment and land use | work  = World Development Indicators, The World Bank | publisher = [[World Bank]] | accessdate = September 12, 2013}}</ref> almost 13% of the Earth's land surface area.

There is no universal agreement on the origin of the term ''Latin America''. Some historians {{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} believe that the term was created by geographers in the 16th century to refer to the parts of the New World colonized by Spain and Portugal, whose [[Romance languages]] derive from Latin. Others argue that the term arose in 1860s France during the reign of [[Napoleon III]], as part of the attempt to create a [[Second French colonial empire|French empire in the Americas]].<ref name="Meade 2016">{{cite book |last=Meade |first=Teresa A. |title=History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present |date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Chichester, UK |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |page=1 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1OzCgAAQBAJ&q=%22historians+disagree+over+the+origin+of+the+name%22 }}</ref> The idea that a part of the Americas has a linguistic affinity with the Romance cultures as a whole can be traced back to the 1830s, in the writing of the French [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonian]] [[Michel Chevalier]], who postulated that this part of the Americas was inhabited by people of a "[[Italic peoples|Latin race]]", and that it could, therefore, ally itself with "[[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]]", ultimately overlapping the [[Latin Church]], in a struggle with "[[Germanic-speaking Europe|Teutonic Europe]]", "[[Anglo-America|Anglo-Saxon America]]" and "[[Slavic Europe]]".<ref name = "mignolo">{{Cite book| last = Mignolo | first = Walter | title = The Idea of Latin America | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vPacXtsWhewC | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | place = Oxford | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-4051-0086-1 |pages = 77–80}}</ref>

Historian [[John Leddy Phelan]] located the origins of the term ''Latin America'' in the French occupation of Mexico. His argument is that French imperialists used the concept of "Latin" America as a way to counter British imperialism, as well as to challenge the German threat to France.<ref>John Leddy Phelan, "Pan-Latinism, French Intervention in Mexico (1861–1867) and the Genesis of the Idea of Latin America," in Juan A. Ortega y Medina, ed., ''Conciencia y autenticidad histo´ricas: Escritos en homenaje a Edmundo O’Gorman'' (Mexico City, 1968), 279–298.</ref>  The idea of a "Latin race" was then taken up by Latin American intellectuals and political leaders of the mid- and late-nineteenth century, who no longer looked to Spain or Portugal as cultural models, but rather to France.<ref>McGuiness, Aims (2003).

However, though Phelan thesis is still frequently mentioned in the U.S. academy, two Latin American historians, the Uruguayan [[Arturo Ardao]] and the Chilean [[:es:Miguel Rojas Mix|Miguel Rojas Mix]] proved decades ago that the term "Latin America" was used earlier than Phelan claimed, and the first use of the term was completely opposite to support imperialist projects in the Americas. Ardao wrote about this subject in his book ''Génesis de la idea y el nombre de América latina'' (Genesis of the Idea and the Name of Latin America, 1980),<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.autoresdeluruguay.uy/biblioteca/Arturo_Ardao/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=ardao_-_genesis_de_la_idea_y_el_nombre_de_america_latina_gallegos_1980_.pdf|title=Genesis de la idea y el nombre de América Latina|last=Ardao|first=Arturo|publisher=Centro de Estudios Latinoamericanos Rómulo Gallegos|year=1980|location=Caracas, Venezuela}}</ref> and Miguel Rojas Mix in his article "Bilbao y el hallazgo de América latina: Unión continental, socialista y libertaria" (Bilbao and the Finding of Latin America: a Continental, Socialist and Libertarian Union, 1986).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rojas Mix|first=Miguel|year=1986|title=Bilbao y el hallazgo de América latina: Unión continental, socialista y libertaria…|journal=Caravelle.

Now under the administration of the United States, by the late 1850s, the term was being used in local California newspapers such as ''[[El Clamor Público]]'' by [[Californios]] writing about {{lang|es|América latina}} and {{lang|es|latinoamérica}}, and identifying as {{lang|es|[[latinos]]}} as the abbreviated term for their "hemispheric membership in {{lang|es|la raza latina}}".<ref name="Gutierrez-2016">{{cite book |last1=Gutierrez |first1=Ramon A. |editor1-last=Gutierrez |editor1-first=Ramon A. |editor2-last=Almaguer |editor2-first=Tomas |title=The New Latino Studies Reader: A Twenty-First-Century Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8IahDAAAQBAJ |chapter=1.

So, regarding when the words "Latin" and "America" were combined for the first time in a printed work, the term "Latin America" was first used in 1856 in a conference by the Chilean politician [[Francisco Bilbao]] in Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/05/16/opinion/o-01901.htm |title=''América latina o Sudamérica?'', por Luiz Alberto Moniz Bandeira, Clarín, 16 de mayo de 2005 |publisher=Clarin.com |date=May 16, 2005 |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref> The conference had the title "Initiative of the America. Idea for a Federal Congress of Republics."<ref name="bilbao f"/> The following year the Colombian writer [[:es:José María Torres Caicedo|José María Torres Caicedo]] also used the term in his poem "The Two Americas".<ref>{{cite web |language=es |via=Proyecto Filosofía en español |url=http://www.filosofia.org/hem/185/18570215.htm |author=José María Torres Caicedo |date=September 26, 1856 |title=Las dos Américas |location=Venice |access-date=April 23, 2013}}</ref> Two events related with the U.S. played a central role in both works. The first event happened less than a decade before the publication of Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo works: the Invasion of Mexico or, in USA the [[Mexican- American war|Mexican–American War]], after which Mexico lost a third of its territory. The second event, the [[Walker affair]], happened the same year both works were written: the decision by U.S. president [[Franklin Pierce]] to recognize the regime recently established in Nicaragua by American [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and his band of filibusters who ruled Nicaragua for nearly a year (1856–57) and attempted to reinstate slavery there, where it had been already abolished for three decades

In both Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo's works, the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican-American War]] and Walker's expedition to Nicaragua are explicitly mentioned as examples of dangers for the region.  For Bilbao, "Latin America" was not a geographical concept, since he excluded Brazil, Paraguay and Mexico.  Both authors also ask for the union of all Latin American countries as the only way to defend their territories against further foreign U.S. interventions. Both rejected also European imperialism, claiming that the return of European countries to non-democratic forms of government was another danger for Latin American countries, and used the same word to describe the state of European politics at the time: "despotism."  Several years later, during the [[French invasion of Mexico]], Bilbao wrote another work, "Emancipation of the Spirit in America," where he asked all Latin American countries to support the Mexican cause against France, and rejected French imperialism in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. He asked Latin American intellectuals to search for their "intellectual emancipation" by abandoning all French ideas, claiming that France was: "Hypocrite, because she [France] calls herself protector of the Latin race just to subject it to her exploitation regime; treacherous, because she speaks of freedom and nationality, when, unable to conquer freedom for herself, she enslaves others instead!"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bilbao |first1=Francisco |title=Emancipación del espíritu de América |url=http://www.franciscobilbao.cl/1909/article-81905.html |website=Francisco Bilbao Barquín, 1823–1865, Chile|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}</ref> Therefore, as Michel Gobat puts it, the term Latin America itself had an "anti-imperial genesis," and their creators were far from supporting any form of imperialism in the region, or in any other place of the globe.

However, in France the term Latin America was used with the opposite intention. It was employed by the French Empire of [[Napoleon III]] during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude [[Anglo America|Anglophone countries]]. It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor of the [[Second Mexican Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Chasteen |first1=John Charles |title=Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fC90B5xkYyIC&pg=PP1 |accessdate=July 4, 2010 |year=2001 |publisher=[[W.

* In a more literal definition, which is close to the semantic origin, ''Latin America'' designates countries in the Americas where a [[Romance language]] (a language derived from [[Latin]]) predominates: Spanish, Portuguese, French, and the [[creole language]]s based upon these.<ref name="Torres"/>

The distinction between ''Latin America'' and ''[[Anglo-America]]'' is a convention based on the predominant languages in the Americas by which Romance-language and English-speaking cultures are distinguished. Neither area is culturally or linguistically homogeneous; in substantial portions of Latin America (e.g., highland [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], Mexico, [[Guatemala]]), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures and, to a lesser extent, Amerindian languages, are predominant, and in other areas, the influence of African cultures is strong (e.g., the Caribbean basin{{spaced ndash}}including parts of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]).

The term is not without controversy.  Historian Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo explores at length the "allure and power" of the idea of Latin America. He remarks at the outset, "The idea of 'Latin America' ought to have vanished with the obsolescence of racial theory... But it is not easy to declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed," going on to say, "The term is here to stay, and it is important."<ref>Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo, ''Latin America: The Allure and Power of an Idea''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2017, 1, 3.</ref> Following in the tradition of Chilean writer Francisco Bilbao, who excluded Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay from his early conceptualization of Latin America,<ref>Francisco Bilbao, ''La América en peligro'', Buenos Aires: Impr. de Berheim y Boeno 1862, 14, 23, quoted in Tenorio-Trillo, ''Latin America'', p. 5.</ref> Chilean historian [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]] has criticized the term Latin America for "disguising" and "diluting" the Spanish character of a region (i.e. [[Hispanic America]]) with the inclusion of nations that according to him do not share the same pattern of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquest and colonization]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gongóra |first1=Alvaro |last2=de la Taille |first2=Alexandrine|last3=Vial |first3=Gonzalo |author-link3=Gonzalo Vial Correa |title=Jaime Eyzaguirre en su tiempo |language=es |publisher=Zig-Zag |page=223 }}</ref>

===Subregions and countries===
Latin America can be subdivided into several subregions based on geography, politics, demographics and culture. If defined as all of the Americas south of the United States, the basic geographical subregions are North America, Central America, the [[Caribbean]] and South America;<ref name=GeoSEP>{{cite book |title=Geografía, Quinto Grado [Geography, Fifth Grade] |publisher=Secretaría de Educación Pública [Secretariat of Public Education]|location=Mexico City |pages=75–83 |author=María Alejandra Acosta Garcia |edition=Second |author2=Sheridan González |author3=Ma. de Lourdes Romero |author4=Luis Reza |author5=Araceli Salinas |via=Comisión Nacional de Libros de Texto Gratuitos (CONALITEG) |chapter=Three |date=June 2011}}</ref> the latter contains further politico-geographical subdivisions such as the [[Southern Cone]], [[the Guianas]] and the [[Andean states]]. It may be subdivided on linguistic grounds into [[Hispanic America]], [[Portuguese America]] and [[French America]].

===Pre-Columbian history===
{{Main|Settlement of the Americas|Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Pre-Columbian era}}

[[File:80 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009 - edit.2.jpg|thumb|right|A view of [[Machu Picchu]], a pre-Columbian [[Inca]] site in [[Peru]].]]
[[File:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Maya Civilization|Mayan]] archeological site [[Chichen Itza]]. ]]

The earliest known settlement was identified at [[Monte Verde]], near [[Puerto Montt]] in Southern Chile. Its occupation dates to some 14,000 years ago and there is some disputed evidence of even earlier occupation. Over the course of millennia, people spread to all parts of the continents. By the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]], South America's vast rainforests, mountains, plains and coasts were the home of tens of millions of people. The earliest settlements in the Americas are of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas Culture]]<ref>The preceramic Las Vegas culture of coastal Ecuador https://www.jstor.org/pss/280325</ref> from about 8000&nbsp;BCE and 4600&nbsp;BCE, a sedentary group from the coast of [[Ecuador]], the forefathers of the more known [[Valdivia culture]], of the same era. Some groups formed more permanent settlements such as the [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] (or "[[Muisca people|Muisca]]" or "Muysca") and the [[Tairona]] groups. These groups are in the circum Caribbean region. The Chibchas of [[Colombia]], the [[Quechuas]] and [[Aymaras]] of [[Bolivia]] were the three indigenous groups that settled most permanently.

The region was home to many [[indigenous peoples]] and advanced civilizations, including the [[Aztecs]], [[Toltecs]], [[Maya Civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca]]. The [[golden age]] of the Maya began about 250, with the last two great [[civilization]]s, the Aztecs and Incas, emerging into prominence later on in the early fourteenth century and mid-fifteenth centuries, respectively. The Aztec empire was ultimately the most powerful civilization known throughout the Americas, until its downfall in part by the Spanish invasion.

===Iberian colonization===

With the arrival of the Spaniards and Portuguese, the indigenous elites, such as the Incas and Aztecs, were deposed and/or co-opted.. [[Hernándo Cortés]] seized the Aztec elite's power in alliance with peoples who had been subjugated by this polity. [[Francisco Pizarro]] eliminated the Incan rule in Peru. Both Spain and Portugal colonized and settled the Americas, which along with the rest of the uncolonized world, was divided among them by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|line of demarcation]] in 1494. This treaty gave Spain all areas to the west, and Portugal all areas to the east (the Portuguese lands in South America subsequently becoming Brazil). By the end of the sixteenth century Spain and Portugal controlled territory extending from Alaska to the southern tips of the [[Patagonia]]. Iberian culture, customs and government were introduced with the settlers who widely intermarried with local populations. The Catholic Religion was the only official religion in all territories under Spanish and Portuguese rule. 

[[File:Imperios Español y Portugués 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]

Epidemics of diseases which came with the Spaniards, such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], wiped out a large portion of the indigenous population. Historians cannot determine the number of natives who died due to European diseases, but some put the figures as high as 85% and as low as 25%. Due to the lack of written records, specific numbers are hard to verify. Many of the survivors were forced to work in European plantations and mines until indigenous slavery was outlawed with the [[New Laws]] of 1542. Unlike in English colonies, [[Miscegenation|Intermixing]] between the indigenous peoples and Iberian colonists was very common and, by the end of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]], people of mixed ancestry ([[mestizo]]s) formed majorities in several colonies.

====Slavery and forced labor in colonial Latin America====
{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}
{{see|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}

Indigenous peoples of the Americas in various colonies were forced to work in plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries.

The Mita of Colonial Latin America was a system of forced labor imposed on the natives. First established by Viceroy Francisco de Toledo (1569–1581), the Mita was upheld by laws that designated how large draft levies were and how much money the workers would receive that was based on how many shifts each individual worker performed. Toledo established Mitas at Potosi and Huancavelica, where the Mitayos—the workers—would be reduced in number to a fraction of how many were originally assigned before the 1700s. While several villages managed to resist the Mita, others offered payment to colonial administrators as a way out. In exchange, free labor became available through volunteers, though the Mita was kept in place as workers like miners, for example, were paid low wages. The Spanish Crown had not made any ruling on the Mita or approved of it when Toledo first established it in spite of the uncertainty of the practice since the Crown could have gained benefits from it. However, the cortes of Spain later abolished it in 1812 once complaints of the Mita violating humanitarian rights were made. Yet complaints also came from: governors; landowners; native leaders known as Kurakas; and even priests, each of whom preferred other methods of economic exploitation. Despite its fall, the Mita made it to the 1800s.<ref>Brown, K. W. (2008). Mita. In J. Kinsbruner & E. D. Langer (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture (2nd ed., Vol. 4, pp. 635–636). Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons.</ref>

Another important group of slaves to mention were the slaves brought over from Africa. The first slaves came over with Christopher Columbus from the very beginning on his earliest voyages. However in the few hundred years, the Atlantic Slave trade would begin delivering slaves, imported by Spain and other colonizers, by the millions. Many of the large scale productions were run by forced slave labor. They were a part of sugar and coffee production, farming (beans, rice, corn, fruit, etc.), Mining, whale oil and multiple other jobs. Slaves were also house workers, servants, military soldiers, and much more. To say the least these people were property and treated as such. Though indigenous slaves existed, they were no match in quantity and lack of quality jobs when compared to the African slave. The slave population was massive compared to the better known slave ownership in the United States. After 1860 Brazil alone had imported over 4&nbsp;million slaves, which only represented about 35% of the Atlantic slave trade. Despite the large number of slaves in Latin America, there was not as much reproduction of slaves amongst the population. Because most of the slaves then were African-born, they were more subject to rebellion. The United States involvement in the slave trade is well known amongst North America, however it hides a larger and in some ways crueler operation in the south which had a much longer history.{{sfnp|Meade|2016|pp=53–57}}

===Independence (1804–1825)===
{{Main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence}}
[[File:Bolivar Arturo Michelena.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.70|[[Simón Bolívar]], Liberator of [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Panama]]]]

In 1804, Haiti became the first Latin American nation to gain independence, following a violent slave revolt led by [[Toussaint L'ouverture]] on the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]]. The victors abolished slavery. Haitian independence inspired independence movements in Spanish America.
[[File:Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla.png|thumbnail|left|upright=0.70|[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] was the first leader of the [[Mexican War of Independence]].]]
By the end of the eighteenth century, Spanish and Portuguese power waned on the global scene as other European powers took their place, notably Britain and France. Resentment grew among the majority of the population in Latin America over the restrictions imposed by the Spanish government, as well as the dominance of native Spaniards (Iberian-born ''[[Peninsulares]]'') in the major social and political institutions. [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of Spain in 1808 marked a turning point, compelling [[Criollo people|Criollo]] elites to form [[junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]] that advocated independence. Also, the newly independent [[Haiti]], the second oldest nation in the [[New World]] after the United States, further fueled the independence movement by inspiring the leaders of the movement, such as [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] of Mexico, [[Simón Bolívar]] of Venezuela and [[José de San Martín]] of Argentina, and by providing them with considerable munitions and troops.

Fighting soon broke out between juntas and the Spanish colonial authorities, with initial victories for the advocates of independence. Eventually, these early movements were crushed by the [[Royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist troops]] by 1810, including those of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in Mexico in the year 1810. Later on [[Francisco de Miranda]] in Venezuela by 1812. Under the leadership of a new generation of leaders, such as [[Simón Bolívar]] "The Liberator", [[José de San Martín]] of Argentina, and other ''[[Libertadores]]'' in South America, the independence movement regained strength, and by 1825, all [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], except for Puerto Rico and Cuba, had gained independence from Spain. In the same year in Mexico, a military officer, [[Agustín de Iturbide]], led a coalition of conservatives and liberals who created a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Iturbide as emperor. This [[First Mexican Empire]] was short-lived, and was followed by the creation of a republic in 1823.

During the last phase of the monarchy, an internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery.

===Conservative–liberal conflicts in the 19th century===
[[File:Hisparevol.gif|thumb|upright=1.25|'''Development of Spanish American Independence'''<br />{{legend |#FF0000|Government under traditional Spanish law}}{{legend |#FFA500|Loyal to Supreme Central Junta or Cortes}}{{legend |#FFFF00|American junta or insurrection movement}}{{legend |#008000|Independent state declared or established}}{{legend |#000080|Height of French control of the Peninsula}}]]

After the independence of many Latin American countries, there was a conflict between the people and the government, much of which can be reduced to the contrasting ideologies between liberalism and conservatism.<ref>Pozas, Mario A. ''El liberalismo hispanoamericano'' en el siglo XIX. pg2</ref> Conservatism was the dominant system of government prior to the revolutions and it was founded on having social classes, including governing by kings. Liberalists wanted to see a change in the ruling systems, and to move away from monarchs and social classes to promote equality.

When liberal [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of Mexico in 1824, conservatists relied on their belief that the state had been better off before the new government came into power, so, by comparison, the old government was better in the eyes of the Conservatives. Following this sentiment, the conservatives pushed to take control of the government, and they succeeded. [[General Santa Anna]] was elected president in 1833. The following decade, the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–48) caused Mexico to lose a significant amount of territory to the United States. This loss led to a rebellion by the enraged liberal forces against the conservative government.

In 1837, conservative [[Rafael Carrera]] conquered [[Guatemala]] and separated from the [[Central American Union]]. The instability that followed the disintegration of the union led to the independence of the other Central American countries.

In Brazil, rural aristocrats were in conflict with the urban conservatives. Portuguese control over Brazilian ports continued after Brazil's independence. Following the conservative idea that the old government was better, urbanites tended to support conservatism because more opportunities were available to them as a result of the Portuguese presence.

[[Simón Bolívar]] became president of [[Gran Colombia]] in 1819 after the region gained independence from Spain. He led a military-controlled state. Citizens did not like the government's position under Bolívar: The people in the military were unhappy with their roles, and the civilians were of the opinion that the military had too much power. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, New Grenada continued to have conflicts between conservatives and liberals. These conflicts were each concentrated in particular regions, with conservatives particularly in the southern mountains and the Valley of Cauca. In the mid-1840s some leaders in Caracas organized a liberal opposition. Antonio Leocadio Guzman was an active participant and journalist in this movement and gained much popularity among the people of Caracas.<ref>Halperín Donghi, T. (2013). ''Historia contemporánea de América latina''. Madrid: Alianza.</ref>

In [[Argentina]], the conflict manifested itself as a prolonged civil war between ''[[Unitarian Party|unitarianas]]'' (i.e. ''centralists'') and ''[[Federales|federalists]]'', which were in some aspects respectively analogous to liberals and conservatives in other countries. Between 1832 and 1852, the country existed as a [[Argentine Confederation|confederation]], without a head of state, although the federalist governor of Buenos Aires province, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], was given the powers of debt payment and international relations and exerted a growing hegemony over the country. A national constitution was only enacted in 1853, reformed in 1860, and the country reorganized as a federal republic led by a [[Generation of '80|liberal-conservative elite]].<ref>Galasso, N. (2011). ''Historia de la Argentina'' (Vol. 1).</ref> After Uruguay achieved its independence, in 1828, a similar polarization crystallized between ''blancos'' and ''colorados'', where the agrarian conservative interests were pitted against the liberal commercial interests based in Montevideo, and which eventually resulted in the ''[[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]]'' civil war (1839–1851).<ref>Hudson, R., & Meditz, S. (1990). ''Uruguay: A Country Study''.</ref>

===British influence in Latin America during the 19th century===
[[File:La Reconquista de Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|left|[[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]]. [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|Beresford]] surrenders to [[Santiago de Liniers]] (1806).]]

Losing most of its North American colonies at the end of the 18th century left Great Britain in need of new markets to supply resources in the early 19th century.<ref name="Donghi, T. 1970">Donghi, T. (1970). ''Historia contemporánea de América Latina'' (2. ed.). Madrid: Alianza Editorial. 148–149</ref> In order to solve this problem, Great Britain turned to the Spanish colonies in South America for resources and markets. In 1806 a small British force surprise attacked the capitol of the viceroyalty in&nbsp;[[Río de la Plata]].<ref>Donghi, 88</ref>&nbsp;As a result, the local garrison protecting the capitol was destroyed in an attempt to defend against the British conquest. The British were able to capture large amounts of precious metals, before a French naval force intervened on behalf of the Spanish King and took down the invading force. However, this caused much turmoil in the area as militia took control of the area from the viceroy. The next year the British attacked once again with a much larger force attempting to reach and conquer Montevideo.<ref>Donghi, 89</ref> They failed to reach [[Montevideo]] but succeeded in establishing an alliance with the locals. As a result, the British were able to take control of the Indian markets.

This newly gained British dominance hindered the development of Latin American industries and strengthened the dependence on the world trade&nbsp;network.<ref>Engerman, Stanley L., and Kenneth L. Sokoloff. "History Lessons: Institutions, Factors Endowments, and Paths of Development in the New World." ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'' Vol. 14(3) pp. 217–232 (2000): pp. 217–232.

===French involvement in Latin America during the 19th century===
[[File:Dell'Acqua Ernennung Maximilians zum Kaiser Mexikos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maximilian of Habsburg|Maximilian]] receiving a Mexican delegation at [[Miramare|Miramar Castle]] in [[Trieste]], Italy]]

Between 1821 and 1910, Mexico battled through various civil wars between the established Conservative government and the Liberal reformists ("Mexico Timeline- Page 2)". On May 8, 1827 Baron Damas, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Sebastián Camacho, a Mexican diplomat, signed an agreement called "The Declarations" which contained provisions regarding commerce and navigation between France and Mexico. At this time the French government did not recognize Mexico as an independent entity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=William Spence|title=French Intervention in Mexico in 1838|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=24|issue=2|year=1944|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=222–223|jstor=2507834|doi=10.2307/2507834}}</ref> It was not until 1861 that the liberalist rebels, led by Benito Juárez, took control of Mexico City, consolidating liberal rule. However, the constant state of warfare left Mexico with a tremendous amount of debt owed to Spain, England, and France, all of whom funded the Mexican war effort (Neeno). As newly appointed president, Benito Juárez suspended payment of debts for next two years, to focus on a rebuilding and stabilization initiative in Mexico under the new government. On December 8, 1861, Spain, England and France landed in Veracruz to seize unpaid debts from Mexico. However, Napoleon III, with intentions of establishing a French client state to further push his economic interests, pressured the other two powers to withdraw in 1862 (Greenspan; "French Intervention in Mexico…").
[[File:Batalla de Puebla.png|upright=0.80|thumb|right|Painting depicting the [[Battle of Puebla]] in 1862]]
France under Napoleon III remained and established Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=French Intervention in Mexico and the American Civil War, 1862–1867|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/french-intervention |website=U.S Department of State Office of the Historian}}</ref> The march by the French to Mexico City enticed heavy resistance by the Mexican government, it resulted in open warfare. The Battle of Puebla in 1862 in particular presented an important turning point in which Ignacio Zaragoza led the Mexican army to victory as they pushed back the French offensive ("Timeline of the Mexican Revolution"). The victory came to symbolize Mexico's power and national resolve against foreign occupancy and as a result delayed France's later attack on Mexico City for an entire year (Cinco de Mayo (Mexican History)). With heavy resistance by Mexican rebels and the fear of United States intervention against France, forced Napoleon III to withdraw from Mexico, leaving Maximilian to surrender, where he would be later executed by Mexican troops under the rule of Porfirio Díaz.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ridge Jr.|first1=Michael Allen|title=A country in need of American instruction : The U.S. mission to shape and transform Mexico, 1848–1911|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3321&context=etd|website=Iowa Research Online|publisher=University of Iowa}}</ref> Napoleon III's desire to expand France's economic empire influenced the decision to seize territorial domain over the Central American region. The port city of Veracruz, Mexico and France's desire to construct a new canal were of particular interest. Bridging both New World and East Asian trade routes to the Atlantic were key to Napoleon III's economic goals to the mining of precious rocks and the expansion of France's textile industry. Napoleon's fear of the United States' economic influence over the Pacific trade region, and in turn all New World economic activity, pushed France to intervene in Mexico under the pretense of collecting on Mexico's debt. Eventually France began plans to build the Panama Canal in 1881 until 1904 when the United States took over and proceeded with its construction and implementation ("Read Our Story").

===American involvement in Latin America===

====Monroe Doctrine====
[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the [[Monroe Doctrine]] to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]]]]
The [[Monroe Doctrine]] was included in President [[James Monroe]]'s 1823 annual message to Congress. The doctrine warns European nations that the United States will no longer tolerate any new colonization of Latin American countries. It was originally drafted to meet the present major concerns, but eventually became the precept of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. The doctrine was put into effect in 1865 when the U.S. government supported Mexican president, [[Benito Juárez]], diplomatically and militarily. Some Latin American countries viewed the U.S. interventions, allowed by the Monroe Doctrine when the U.S. deems necessary, with suspicion.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. ''A History of Latin America''. pg 491</ref>

Another important aspect of United States involvement in Latin America is the case of the [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. In 1855, he traveled to Nicaragua hoping to overthrow the government and take the land for the United States. With only the aid of 56 followers, he was able to take over the city of [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], declaring himself commander of the army and installing [[Patricio Rivas]] as a puppet president. However, Rivas's presidency ended when he fled Nicaragua; Walker rigged the following election to ensure that he became the next president. His presidency did not last long, however, as he was met with much opposition from political groups in Nicaragua and neighbouring countries. On May 1, 1857, Walker was forced by a coalition of Central American armies to surrender himself to a United States Navy officer who repatriated him and his followers. When Walker subsequently returned to Central America in 1860, he was apprehended by the Honduran authorities and executed.

====Mexican–American War (1846–48)====
[[File:Mexico nebel.jpg|thumb|left|American occupation of [[Mexico City]]]]

The [[Mexican–American War]], another instance of U.S. involvement in Latin America, was a war between the United States and Mexico that started in April 1846 and lasted until February 1848. The main cause of the war was the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845 and a dispute afterwards about whether the border between Mexico and the United States ended where Mexico claimed, at the [[Nueces River]], or ended where the United States claimed, at the [[Rio Grande]]. Peace was negotiated between the United States and Mexico with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which stated that Mexico was to cede land which would later become part of California and New Mexico as well as give up all claims to Texas, for which the United States would pay $15,000,000. However, tensions between the two countries were still high and over the next six years things only got worse with raids along the border and attacks by Native Americans against Mexican citizens. To defuse the situation, the United States agreed to purchase 29,670 squares miles of land from Mexico for $10,000,000 so a southern railroad could be built to connect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. This would become known as the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. A critical component of U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs took form in the [[Spanish–American War]], which drastically affected the futures of Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Americas, as well as Guam and the Philippines, by acquiring the majority of the last remaining Spanish colonial possessions.

====From the "Big Stick" to the "Good Neighbor" policy====
[[File:Satterfield cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield]] cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic]]
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the U.S. banana importing companies [[United Fruit Company]], [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] (both ancestors of [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]]), and [[Standard Fruit Company]] (now [[Dole Food Company|Dole]]), acquired large amounts of land in Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica. The companies gained leverage over the governments and a ruling elite in these countries by dominating their economies and paying kickbacks, and exploited local workers. These countries came to be called [[banana republic]]s.

The 1898 [[Spanish–American War]] resulted in the end of Spanish colonial presence in the Americas. A period of frequent U.S. intervention in Latin America followed, with the acquisition of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] in 1903, the so-called [[Banana Wars]] in Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Honduras; the [[Caco Wars]] in Haiti; and the so-called [[Border War (1910–1919)|Border War]] with Mexico. Some 3,000 Latin Americans were killed between 1914 and 1933.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gruhl|first1=Werner|title=Imperial Japan's World War Two: 1931 – 1945|date=2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ow5Wlmu9MPQC&pg=PA181|isbn=9780765803528}}</ref> The U.S. press described the occupation of the Dominican Republic as an 'Anglo-Saxon crusade', carried out to keep the Latin Americans  'harmless against the ultimate consequences of their own misbehavior'.<ref>American press voices cited in Blassingame (1969), p. 29.</ref>

After World War I, U.S. interventionism diminished, culminating in President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Good Neighbor policy]] in 1933.

====World War I and the Zimmermann Telegram====
[[File:Zimmermann Telegram.jpeg|thumb|The Zimmermann Telegram as it was sent from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to Ambassador [[Heinrich von Eckardt]] (German ambassador to Mexico)]]

The [[Zimmermann Telegram]] was a 1917 diplomatic proposal from the [[German Empire]] for [[History of Mexico|Mexico]] to join an alliance with Germany in the event of the United States entering [[World War I]] against Germany. The proposal was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence. The revelation of the contents outraged the American public and swayed public opinion. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] moved to arm American merchant ships to defend themselves against German submarines, which had started to attack them. The news helped generate support for the [[American entry into World War I|United States declaration of war on Germany]] in April of that year.<ref>[[#Andrew|Andrew]], p.&nbsp;42.</ref>

The message came as a [[code (cryptography)|coded]] telegram dispatched by the Foreign Secretary of the German Empire, [[Arthur Zimmermann]], on January 16, 1917. The message was sent to the German ambassador of Mexico, [[Heinrich von Eckardt]]. Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of the [[Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I#1917: Renewed "unrestricted" campaign|resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare]] by Germany on February 1, an act which Germany presumed would lead to war. The telegram instructed Ambassador Eckardt that if the U.S. appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican Government with a proposal for a military alliance, with funding from Germany. As part of the alliance, Germany would assist Mexico in reconquering Texas and the Southwest. Eckardt was instructed to urge Mexico to help broker an alliance between Germany and Japan. Mexico, in the middle of the [[Mexican Revolution]], far weaker militarily, economically and politically than the U.S., ignored the proposal; after the U.S. entered the war, it officially rejected it.

====Brazil's participation in World War II====
After World War I, in which Brazil was an ally of the United States, Great Britain, and France, the country realized it needed a more capable army but did not have the technology to create it. In 1919, the French Military Mission was established by the French Commission in Brazil. Their main goal was to contain the inner rebellions in Brazil. They tried to assist the army by bringing them up to the European military standard but constant civil missions did not prepare them for [[World War II]].

Brazil's President, [[Getúlio Vargas]], wanted to industrialize Brazil, allowing it to be more competitive with other countries. He reached out to Germany, Italy, France, and the United States to act as trade allies. Many Italian and German people immigrated to Brazil many years before World War II began thus creating a Nazi influence. The immigrants held high positions in government and the armed forces.

[[File:Massarosaw.jpg|right|thumb|Brazilian soldiers greet Italian civilians in the city of [[Massarosa]], September 1944. Brazil was the only independent Latin American country to send ground troops to fight in WWII.]]

Brazil continued to try to remain neutral to the United States and Germany because it was trying to make sure it could continue to be a place of interest for both opposing countries. Brazil attended continental meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1936); Lima, Peru (1938); and Havana, Cuba (1940) that obligated them to agree to defend any part of the Americas if they were to be attacked. Eventually, Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.

Once the German submarines attacked unarmed Brazilian trading ships, President Vargas met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss how they could retaliate. On January 22, 1942, Brazil officially ended all relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy, becoming a part of the Allies.

The [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] was sent to Naples, Italy to fight for democracy. Brazil was the only Latin American country to send troops to Europe. Initially, Brazil wanted to only provide resources and shelter for the war to have a chance of gaining a high postwar status but ended up sending 25,000 men to fight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penteado|first=Carlos Joes A.|title=Hyper War: The Brazilian Participation in World War II|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Brazil/Participation/index.html|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref>

However, it was not a secret that Vargas had an admiration for Hitler's Nazi Germany and its Führer. He even let German Luftwaffe build secret air forces around Brazil. This alliance with Germany became Brazil's second best trade alliance behind the United States.

It was recently{{when|date=May 2020}} found that 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including Croats, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided the Nazi war machine. Most, perhaps as many as 5,000, went to Argentina; between 1,500 and 2,000 are thought{{by whom|date=May 2020}} to have made it to Brazil; around 500 to 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

After World War II, the United States and Latin America continued to have a close relationship. For example, USAID created family planning programs in Latin America combining the NGOs already in place, providing the women in largely Catholic areas access to contraception.<ref>{{cite web|title=Health in Latin America and the Caribbean|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090422_bliss_healthlatinamer_web.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

Mexico entered World War II in response to German attacks on Mexican ships.  The ''[[SS Potrero del Llano|Potrero del Llano]],'' originally an Italian tanker, had been seized in port by the Mexican government in April 1941 and renamed in honor of a region in Veracruz.

In response, President [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]] and the Mexican government declared war on the Axis powers on May 22, 1942.

A large part of Mexico's contribution to the war came through an agreement January 1942 that allowed Mexican nationals living in the United States to join the American armed forces. As many as 250,000 Mexicans served in this way.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lars Schoultz|title=National Security and United States Policy Toward Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A_X_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA175|year=2014|page=175|isbn=9781400858491}}</ref> In the final year of the war, Mexico sent one air squadron to serve under the Mexican flag: the [[Mexican Air Force]]'s ''[[Escuadrón 201|Escuadrón Aéreo de Pelea 201]]'' (201st Fighter Squadron), which saw combat in the [[Philippines]] in the war against [[Imperial Japan]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Klemen|first=L.|title=201st Mexican Fighter Squadron|url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/201squadron.html|work=The Netherlands East Indies 1941–1942}} 201st Mexican Fighter Squadron</ref> Mexico was the only Latin-American country to send troops to the Asia-Pacific theatre of the war.

Cuba was an important participant in the [[Battle of the Caribbean]] and its navy gained a reputation for skill and efficiency. The navy escorted hundreds of Allied ships through hostile waters, flew thousands of hours on convoy and patrol duty, and rescued over 200 victims of German U-Boat attacks from the sea. Six Cuban merchant ships were sunk by U-boats, taking the lives of around eighty sailors. On May 15, 1943, a squadron of Cuban [[submarine chasers]] sank the {{GS|U-176}} near [[Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago|Cayo Blanquizal]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Polmar| first=Norman|author2=Thomas B.

====Involvement in World War II====
There was a Nazi influence in certain parts of the region, but Jewish migration from Europe during the war continued. Only a few people recognized or knew about the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stavans|first=IIan|title=The Impact of the Holocaust in Latin America}}</ref> Furthermore, numerous military bases were built during the war by the United States, but some also by the Germans.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Even now, unexploded bombs from the second world war that need to be made safe still remain.<ref>{{cite news|title=WWII Bombs Destroyed in the Galapagos Islands|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16615945|work=BBC News|accessdate=May 24, 2012|date=January 18, 2012}}</ref>

The only international conflicts since World War II have been the [[Football War]] between El Salvador and Honduras (1969), the [[Cenepa War]] between Ecuador and Peru (1995), along with Argentina's war with the United Kingdom for control of the Falkland Islands (1982). The [[Falklands War]] left 649 Argentines (including 143 conscripted privates) dead and 1,188 wounded, while the UK lost 255 (88 Royal Navy, 27 Royal Marines, 16 Royal Fleet Auxiliary, 123 British Army, and 1 Royal Air Force) dead.

====Economy====
[[File:NASAburningbrazil.jpg|thumb|Burning forest in Brazil. The removal of forest to make way for [[cattle ranching]] was the leading cause of deforestation in the Brazilian [[Amazon rainforest]] from the mid-1960s. [[Soybean]]s have become one of the most important contributors to deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7206165.stm Brazil Amazon deforestation soars]". BBC News. January 24, 2008.</ref>]]

The Great Depression caused Latin America to grow at a slow rate, separating it from leading industrial democracies. The two world wars and U.S. Depression also made Latin American countries favor internal economic development, leading Latin America to adopt the policy of [[import substitution industrialization]].<ref name="History of Latin America">{{cite encyclopedia|title=History of Latin America|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> Countries also renewed emphasis on exports. Brazil began selling automobiles to other countries, and some Latin American countries set up plants to assemble imported parts, letting other countries take advantage of Latin America's low labor costs. Colombia began to export flowers, emeralds and coffee grains and gold, becoming the world's second-leading flower exporter.

Economic integration was called for, to attain economies that could compete with the economies of the United States or Europe. Starting in the 1960s with the Latin American Free Trade Association and Central American Common Market, Latin American countries worked toward economic integration.

In efforts to help regain global economic strength, the U.S. began to heavily assist countries involved in World War II at the expense of Latin America. Markets that were previously unopposed as a result of the war in Latin America grew stagnant as the rest of the world no longer needed their goods.

====Reforms====
Large countries like Argentina called for reforms to lessen the disparity of wealth between the rich and the poor, which has been a long problem in Latin America that stunted economic growth.<ref name="Kaufman">{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Robert|title=The Political Effects of Inequality: Some Inconvenient Facts|publisher=Rutgers University}}</ref>

Advances in public health caused an explosion of population growth, making it difficult to provide social services. Education expanded, and social security systems introduced, but benefits usually went to the middle class, not the poor. As a result, the disparity of wealth increased. Increasing inflation and other factors caused countries to be unwilling to fund social development programs to help the poor.

====Bureaucratic authoritarianism====
Bureaucratic authoritarianism was practised in Brazil after 1964, in Argentina, and in Chile under Augusto Pinochet, in a response to harsh economic conditions. It rested on the conviction that no democracy could take the harsh measures to curb inflation, reassure investors, and quicken economic growth quickly and effectively. Though inflation fell sharply, industrial production dropped with the decline of official protection.<ref name="Kaufman" />

====US relations====

[[File:Reunión Pinochet - Kissinger.jpg|thumb|Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] shaking hands with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1976]]
After [[World War II]] and the beginning of a [[Cold War]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], US diplomats became interested in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and frequently{{vague|date=June 2014}} waged proxy wars against the Soviet Union in these countries. The US sought to stop the spread of communism. Latin American countries generally sided with the US in the Cold War period, even though they were neglected since the US's concern with communism were focused in Europe and Asia, not Latin America. Between 1946 and 1959 Latin America received only 2% of the United States foreign aid despite having poor conditions similar to the main recipients of The [[Marshall Plan]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Born into Blood and Fire, A Concise History of Latin America|last = Chasteen|first = John|publisher = W.W. Norton & Company Inc.|year = 2011|page = 253}}</ref> Some Latin American governments also complained of the US support in the overthrow of some nationalist governments, and intervention through the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. In 1947, the US Congress passed the [[National Security Act of 1947|National Security Act]], which created the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] in response to the United States's growing obsession with anti-communism.<ref name="Dominguez">{{cite web|last=Dominguez|first=Jorge|title=US-Latin American Relations During the Cold War and its Aftermath|publisher=Institute of Latin American Studies}}</ref> In 1954, when [[Jacobo Arbenz]] of Guatemala accepted the support of communists and attacked holdings of the [[United Fruit Company]], the US decided to assist Guatemalan counter-revolutionaries in overthrowing Arbenz.<ref>Schneider, Ronald M. Latin American Political History: Patterns and Personalities. pg 274–275</ref> These interventionist tactics featured the use of the CIA rather than the military, which was used in Latin America for the majority of the Cold War in events including the overthrow of [[Salvador Allende]]. Latin America was more concerned with issues of economic development, while the United States focused on fighting communism, even though the presence of communism was small in Latin America.<ref name="Dominguez" />

Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] (r. 1930–61) achieved support from the US by becoming Latin America's leading anti-communist.<ref>[https://spartacus-educational.com/JFKtrujillo.htm "Rafael Trujillo"]</ref> Trujillo extended his tyranny to the USA,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Dictator and the Mafia: How Rafael Trujillo Partnered with US Criminals to Extend His Power |url=https://www.academia.edu/37664185}}</ref><ref name=Rabe>{{cite book |last1=Rabe |first1=Stephen G. |title=The Most Dangerous Area in the World: John F.

But after Castro's seizure of power in 1959, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] concluded that Trujillo had become a Cold War liability.<ref name=Rabe/> In 1960, Trujillo threatened to align with the Communist world in response to US and Latin American rejection of his regime. La Voz Dominicana and Radio Caribe began attacking the US in Marxian terms, and the Dominican Communist party was legalized. Trujillo also unsuccessfully attempted to establish contacts and relations with the [[Soviet Bloc]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pope Atkins |first1=G. |title=The Dominican Republic and the United States: From Imperialism to Transnationalism |page=118}}</ref> In 1961, Trujillo was murdered with weapons supplied by the CIA.<ref>[https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-assassination-of-rafael-trujillo/ "The Assassination of Rafael Trujillo"]</ref> [[Ramfis Trujillo]], the dictator's son, remained in de facto control of the government for the next six months through his position as commander of the armed forces. Trujillo's brothers, Hector Bienvenido and Jose Arismendi Trujillo, returned to the country and began immediately to plot against President Balaguer. On November 18, 1961, as a planned coup became more evident, US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] issued a warning that the United States would not "remain idle" if the Trujillos attempted to "reassert dictatorial domination" over the Dominican Republic. Following this warning, and the arrival of a fourteen-vessel US naval task force within sight of [[Santo Domingo]], Ramfis and his uncles fled the country on November 19 with $200&nbsp;million from the Dominican treasury.

====Cuban Revolution====
{{Main|Cuban Revolution}}
By 1959, Cuba was afflicted with a corrupt dictatorship under Batista, and [[Fidel Castro]] ousted Batista that year and set up the first communist state in the hemisphere. The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, and combined with Castro's expropriation of private enterprises, this was detrimental to the Cuban economy.<ref name="History of Latin America" /> Around Latin America, rural guerrilla conflict and urban terrorism increased, inspired by the Cuban example. The United States put down these rebellions by supporting Latin American countries in their counter-guerrilla operations through the Alliance for Progress launched by President John F. Kennedy. This thrust appeared to be successful. A Marxist, Salvador Allende, became president of Chile in 1970, but was overthrown three years later in a military coup backed by the United States. Despite civil war, high crime and political instability, most Latin American countries eventually adopted bourgeois liberal democracies while Cuba maintained its socialist system.

====Bay of Pigs Invasion====
{{Main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}

[[Image:Attack near Playa Giron. April 19, 1961. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Cuban [[T-34]] tanks in the Bay of Pigs invasion]]
Encouraged by the success of Guatemala in the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]],<ref>Schneider, Ronald M. Latin American Political History: Patterns and Personalities. pg 376–377</ref> in 1960, the U.S. decided to support an attack on Cuba by anti-Castro rebels. The Bay of Pigs invasion was an unsuccessful invasion of Cuba in 1961, financed by the U.S. through the CIA, to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]]. The incident proved to be very embarrassing for the new Kennedy administration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bay of Pigs Invasion|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

The failure of the invasion led to a [[Cuba–Soviet Union relations|Soviet-Cuban alliance]].

====Cuban Missile Crisis====
{{Main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}
In 1962, Cuba threatened the USA when it allowed Soviet missiles to be placed on the island, just 90 miles away from Florida; Cuba saw it as a way to defend the island, while the Americans saw it as a threat. The ensuing Cuban Missile Crisis—the closest the world has ever come to total annihilation—almost saw a US invasion or bombing of Cuba, but it ended when the two sides agreed on the removal of missiles; the US removed theirs from Italy and Turkey, while the Soviets removed theirs from Cuba. The crisis' end left Cuba blockaded by the US, which was also obligated to not invade Cuba. In fact, they were allowed to keep [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] as a naval base as per an agreement with the previous government of Batista.

====Alliance for Progress====
President John F. Kennedy initiated the [[Alliance for Progress]] in 1961, to establish economic cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America. The Alliance would provide $20&nbsp;billion for reform in Latin America, and counterinsurgency measures. Instead, the reform failed because of the simplistic theory that guided it and the lack of experienced American experts who could understand Latin American customs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kennedy proposes Alliance for Progress – Mar 13, 1961 |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kennedy-proposes-alliance-for-progress|website=HISTORY|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}</ref>

Armed Cuban intervention overseas began on June 14, 1959 with an invasion of the Dominican Republic<ref name=CIA/> by a group of fifty-six men, who landed a [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar|C-56]] transport aircraft at the military airport of the town of Constanza. Upon their landing, the fifteen-man Dominican garrison began an ongoing gun battle with the invaders, until the survivors disappeared into the surrounding mountains. Immediately after, the Dominican Air Force bombed the area around Constanza with British made [[de Havilland Vampire|Vampire jets]] in an unsuccessful attempt to kill the invaders, which instead killed civilians.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roorda |first1=Eric Paul |title=Historical Dictionary of the Dominican Republic |date=2016 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=80}}</ref> The invaders either died at the hands of machete-swinging peasants,<ref>{{cite news|title=DOMINICANS HUNT REBEL SURVIVORS; Band of 20 Invaders Eluding Troops and Peasants in Wooded Mountain Area |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/07/02/archives/dominicans-hunt-rebel-survivors-band-of-20-invaders-eluding-troops.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 2, 1959}}</ref> or the military captured, tortured, and imprisoned them. A week later, two yachts offloaded 186 invaders onto Chris-Craft launches for a landing on the north coast. Dominican Air Force pilots fired rockets from their Vampire jets into the approaching launches, killing most of the invaders. The survivors were brutally tortured and murdered.

From 1966 until the late 1980s, the Soviet government upgraded Cuba's military capabilities, and Castro saw to it that Cuba assisted with the independence struggles of several countries across the world, most notably Angola and Mozambique in southern Africa, and the anti-imperialist struggles of countries such as Syria, Algeria, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Vietnam.<ref>{{cite book |title=Parameters: Journal of the US Army War College |date=1977 |publisher=U.S. Army War College |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMdLAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA13}}</ref><ref name=CIA>{{cite web |title=Foreign Intervention by Cuba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77M00144R000400100003-7.pdf}}</ref>

South Africa developed nuclear weapons due to the threat to its security posed by the presence of large numbers of Cuban troops in Angola and Mozambique.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Regime: Prospects for the 21st Century |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |page=95}}</ref> In November 1975, Cuba poured more than 65,000 troops into Angola in one of the fastest military mobilizations in history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why the Cuban military machine should intervene in Syria |url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/stranger_than_fiction/2015/10/21/why-the-cuban-military-machine-should-intervene-in-syria_484903}}</ref> On November 10, 1975, Cuban forces defeated the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) in the [[Battle of Quifangondo]]. On November 25, 1975, as the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) tried to cross a bridge, Cubans hidden along the banks of the river [[Operation Savannah (Angola)#Battle of Ebo|attacked]], destroying seven armored cars and killing upwards of 90 enemy soldiers. On March 27, 1976, the last South African troops withdrew from Angola. In September 1977, 12 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]]s conducted strafing flights over Puerto Plata in Dominican Republic to warn then president Joaquín Balaguer against intercepting Cuban warships headed to or returning from Angola.<ref>{{cite web |title=Castro's turbulent ties with the Dominican Republic |url=https://dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2016/11/27/castros-turbulent-ties-with-the-dominican-republic/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cuba Air Force |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/americas/cuba/Cuba-af-home.htm|website=aeroflight.co.uk}}</ref> In 1988, Cuba returned to Angola with a vengeance. The crisis began in 1987 with an assault by Soviet-equipped national army troops against the pro-Western rebel movement [[UNITA]] in southeastern Angola. Soon, the SADF invaded to support the beleaguered US-backed faction and the Angolan offensive stalled. Cuba reinforced its African ally with 55,000 troops, tanks, artillery and [[MiG-23]]s, prompting [[Pretoria]] to call up 140,000 reservists.<ref name=Weigert>{{cite book |last1=Weigert |first1=S. |title=Angola: A Modern Military History, 1961–2002 |date=2011}}</ref> In June 1988, SADF armor and artillery [[Operation Prone|engaged]] [[FAPLA]]-Cuban forces at Techipa, killing 290 Angolans and 10 Cubans.<ref>{{cite book |last1=George |first1=Edward |title=The Cuban Intervention in Angola, 1965–1991: From Che Guevara to Cuito Cuanavale |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> In retaliation, Cuban warplanes hammered South African troops.<ref name=Weigert/> However, both sides quickly pulled back to avoid an escalation of hostilities.<ref name=Weigert/> The [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]] stalemated, and a peace treaty was signed in September 1988. Within two years, the Cold War was over and Cuba's foreign policy shifted away from military intervention.

====Nicaraguan Revolution====
Following the American occupation of Nicaragua in 1912, as part of the [[Banana Wars]], the Somoza family political dynasty came to power, and would rule Nicaragua until their ouster in 1979 during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. The era of Somoza family rule was characterized by strong U.S. support for the government and its military as well as a heavy reliance on U.S.-based multi-national corporations. The Nicaraguan Revolution (Spanish: Revolución Nicaragüense or Revolución Popular Sandinista) encompassed the rising opposition to the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s, the campaign led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) to violently oust the dictatorship in 1978–79, the subsequent efforts of the FSLN to govern Nicaragua from 1979 until 1990 and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Contra War]] which was waged between the FSLN and the [[Contras]] from 1981 to 1990.

The Revolution marked a significant period in Nicaraguan history and revealed the country as one of the major proxy war battlegrounds of the Cold War with the events in the country rising to international attention. Although the initial overthrow of the Somoza regime in 1978–79 was a bloody affair, the Contra War of the 1980s took the lives of tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and was the subject of fierce international debate.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. A history of Latin America. pg541-542</ref> During the 1980s both the FSLN (a leftist collection of political parties) and the Contras (a rightist collection of counter-revolutionary groups) received large amounts of aid from the Cold War super-powers (respectively, the Soviet Union and the United States).

===Washington Consensus===
{{Main|Washington Consensus}}

The set of specific economic policy prescriptions that were considered the "standard" reform package were promoted for crisis-wracked developing countries by Washington, D.C.-based institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], and the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Department of the Treasury]] during the 1980s and 1990s.

In recent years, several Latin American countries led by socialist or other left wing governments{{spaced ndash}}including Argentina and Venezuela{{spaced ndash}}have campaigned for (and to some degree adopted) policies contrary to the Washington Consensus set of policies. (Other Latin countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Peru, have in practice adopted the bulk of the policies.) Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the International Monetary Fund have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the "fundamentalist" policies of the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury for what Stiglitz calls a "one size fits all" treatment of individual economies.

The term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries' national sovereignty.

This politico-economical initiative was institutionalized in North America by 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], and elsewhere in the Americas through a series of [[Free Trade Area of the Americas#Agreements|like agreements]]. The comprehensive [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] project, however, was rejected by most [[Mercosur|South American countries]] at the 2005 [[4th Summit of the Americas]].

===Turn to the left===

[[File:UNASUR-15SEP2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[UNASUR]] summit in the Palacio de la Moneda, [[Santiago de Chile]]]]
In most countries, since the 2000s left-wing political parties have risen to power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The presidencies of [[Hugo Chávez]] in Venezuela, [[Ricardo Lagos]] and [[Michelle Bachelet]] in Chile, [[Lula da Silva]] and [[Dilma Rousseff]] in Brazil, [[Néstor Kirchner]] and his wife [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Cristina Fernández]] in Argentina, [[Tabaré Vázquez]] and [[José Mujica]] in Uruguay, [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador, [[Fernando Lugo]] in Paraguay, [[Manuel Zelaya]] in Honduras (removed from power by a [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|coup d'état]]), [[Mauricio Funes]] and [[Salvador Sánchez Cerén]] in El Salvador are all part of this wave of left-wing politicians who often declare themselves [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Latin American integration|Latin Americanists]], or [[Anti-Imperialism|anti-imperialists]] (often implying [[Anti-Americanism#Latin America|opposition to US]] [[Washington consensus|policies towards the region]]). A development of this has been the creation of the eight-member ALBA alliance, or "[[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America]]" (Spanish: ''Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra América'') by some of the countries already mentioned. By June 2014, Honduras ([[Juan Orlando Hernández]]), Guatemala ([[Otto Pérez Molina]]), and Panama ([[Ricardo Martinelli]]) had right-wing governments.

===Return of social movements===
In 1982, Mexico announced that it could not meet its foreign debt payment obligations, inaugurating a [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis]] that would "discredit" Latin American economies throughout the decade.<ref name="Hershberg & Rosen">Hershberg, Eric, and Fred Rosen, eds. ''Latin America after Neoliberalism''. New York: North American Congress on Latin America, 2006. Print.</ref> This debt crisis would lead to [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reforms that would instigate many social movements in the region. A "reversal of development" reigned over Latin America, seen through negative economic growth, declines in industrial production, and thus, falling living standards for the middle and lower classes.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Escobar|editor-first=Arturo|editor-first2=Sonia E.|editor-last2=Alvarez|title=The Making of Social Movements in Latin America|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Westview|date=1992}}</ref> Governments made financial security their primary policy goal over social security, enacting new neoliberal economic policies that implemented privatization of previously national industries and [[Informal sector|informalization]] of labor.<ref name="Hershberg & Rosen" /> In an effort to bring more investors to these industries, these governments also embraced [[globalization]] through more open interactions with the international economy.

Significantly, as democracy spread across much of Latin America, the realm of government became more inclusive (a trend that proved conducive to social movements), the economic ventures remained exclusive to a few elite groups within society. Neoliberal restructuring consistently redistributed income upward while denying political responsibility to provide social welfare rights, and though [[Development studies|development]] projects took place throughout the region, both inequality and poverty increased.<ref name="Hershberg & Rosen" /> Feeling excluded from these new projects, the lower classes took ownership of their own democracy through a revitalization of social movements in Latin America.

Both urban and rural populations had serious grievances as a result of the above economic and global trends and have voiced them in mass demonstrations. Some of the largest and most violent of these have been protests against cuts in urban services, such as the [[Caracazo]] in Venezuela and the [[Argentinazo]] in Argentina.<ref name="Johnston & Almeida">Johnston, Hank, and Paul Almeida, eds. ''Latin American Social Movements''. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. Print.</ref>

[[File:MST International Socialist46623.jpeg|thumb|right|Children singing the Internationale, 20th anniversary of MST]]
Rural movements have made diverse demands related to unequal land distribution, displacement at the hands of development projects and dams, environmental and indigenous concerns, neoliberal agricultural restructuring, and insufficient means of livelihood. These movements have benefited considerably from transnational support from conservationists and [[International nongovernmental organizations|INGOs]]. The [[Landless Workers' Movement|Movement of Rural Landless Workers]] (MST) is perhaps the largest contemporary Latin American social movement.<ref name="Johnston & Almeida" /> As indigenous populations are primarily rural, indigenous movements account for a large portion of rural social movements, including the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista rebellion]] in Mexico, the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador|CONAIE]]), indigenous organizations in the Amazon region of Ecuador and Bolivia, pan-Mayan communities in Guatemala, and mobilization by the indigenous groups of [[Yanomami]] peoples in the Amazon, [[Guna people|Kuna]] peoples in Panama, and Altiplano [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples in Bolivia.<ref name="Johnston & Almeida" /> Other significant types of social movements include labor struggles and strikes, such as [[recovered factories]] in Argentina, as well as gender-based movements such as the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] in Argentina and protests against [[maquila]] production, which is largely a women's issue because of how it draws on women for cheap labor.<ref name="Johnston & Almeida" />

===Modern era===
The [[2000s commodities boom]] caused positive effects for many Latin American economies. Another trend is the rapidly increasing importance of the [[China–Latin America relations|relations with China]].<ref name=AFP2011>Jordi Zamora. "China's double-edged trade with Latin America." September 3, 2011. AFP. https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggNqQ5G8UFErmAEw71Y-u51P8_Eg?docId=CNG.e829052752a5436e909ab280ad561af6.671</ref>

With the end of the commodity boom in the 2010s, economic stagnation or recession resulted in some countries. As a result, the left-wing governments of the [[Pink Tide]] lost support. The worst-hit was Venezuela, which is facing severe [[Crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela|social and economic upheaval]].

The [[Odebrecht#Legal problems|corruption scandal of Odebrecht]], a Brazilian conglomerate, has raised allegations of corruption across the region's governments (see [[Operation Car Wash]]). The bribery ring has become the largest corruption scandal in Latin American history.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=Nicholas|last2=Zarate|first2=Andrea|title=Corruption Scandals With Brazilian Roots Cascade Across Latin America|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/world/americas/peru-colombia-venezuela-brazil-odebrecht-scandal.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=June 16, 2017|date=February 13, 2017}}</ref> As of July 2017, the highest ranking politicians charged were former Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] (arrested)<ref>{{cite web|title=Ex-President 'Lula' of Brazil Surrenders to Serve 12-Year Jail Term|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/world/americas/brazil-lula-surrenders-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref> and former Peruvian presidents [[Ollanta Humala]] (arrested) and [[Alejandro Toledo]] (fugitive, fled to the US).<ref>{{cite web|title=Another former Peruvian president is sent to jail, this time as part of growing corruption scandal|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-peru-humala-20170714-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 14, 2017|date=July 14, 2017}}</ref>

The inhabitants of Latin America are of a variety of ancestries, ethnic groups, and races, making the region one of the most diverse in the world. The specific composition varies from country to country: some have a predominance of European-Amerindian or more commonly referred to as [[Mestizo]] or [[Castizo]] depending on the admixture, population; in others, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] are a majority; some are dominated by inhabitants of [[White Latin American|European]] ancestry; and some countries' populations are primarily [[Mulatto]]. Various [[Afro-Latin Americans|black]], [[Asian Latin Americans|Asian]] and [[Zambo]] (mixed black and Amerindian) minorities are also identified regularly. People with European ancestry are the largest single group, and along with people of part-European ancestry, they combine to make up approximately 80% of the population,<ref name="CIAEG">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html |title= CIA&nbsp;– The World Factbook – Field Listing&nbsp;– Ethnic groups |accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> or even more.<ref name="Lizcano">{{Cite journal|last=Lizcano Fernández |first=Francisco |date=May–August 2005 |title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI |journal=Convergencia |volume=38 |pages=185–232; table on p. 218 |publisher=[[Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México]], Centro de Investigación en Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades |location=Mexico |issn=1405-1435 |url=http://convergencia.uaemex.mx/rev38/38pdf/LIZCANO.pdf |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920172933/http://convergencia.uaemex.mx/rev38/38pdf/LIZCANO.pdf |archive-date=September 20, 2008 }}</ref>

According to Jon Aske:

{{Quote
|text=Before Hispanics became such a 'noticeable' group in the U.S., the distinction between black and white was the major racial division and according to the [[one-drop rule]] adhered to by the culture at large, one drop of African ancestry usually meant that the person was Black. ...

The notion of '''racial continuum''' and a separation of race (or skin color) and ethnicity, on the other hand, is the norm in most of Latin America. In the Spanish and Portuguese empires, racial mixing or miscegenation was the norm and something that the Spanish and Portuguese had grown rather accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans in the Iberian peninsula. But, demographics may have made this inevitable as well. Thus, for example, of the approximately 13.5&nbsp;million people who lived in the Spanish colonies in 1800 before independence only about one fifth were white. This contrasts with the U.S., where more than four-fifths were whites (out of a population of 5.3&nbsp;million in 1801, 900,000 were slaves, plus approximately 60,000 free blacks). ...

The fact of the recognition of a racial continuum in Hispanic American (sic) does not mean that there wasn't discrimination, which there was, or that there wasn't an obsession with race, or 'castes', as they were sometimes called. ...

In areas with large indigenous Amerindian populations, a racial mixture resulted, which is known in Spanish as ''mestizos'' ... who are a majority in Mexico, Central America and most of South America. Similarly, when African slaves were brought to the Caribbean region and Brazil, where there was very little indigenous presence left, unions between them and Spanish produced a population of mixed ''mulatos'' ... who are a majority of the population in many of those Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela). 
}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/race.htm|title=Hispanics and Race|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>

Aske has also written that:

{{Quote
|text=Spanish colonization was rather different from later English, or British, colonization of North America. They had different '''systems of colonization''' and different methods of subjugation. While the English were primarily interested in grabbing land, the Spanish in addition had a mandate to incorporate the land's inhabitants into their society, something which was achieved by religious conversion and sexual unions which produced a new 'race' of ''mestizos'', a mixture of Europeans and indigenous peoples. ''mestizos'' (sic) form the majority of the population in Mexico, Central America, and much of South America. Racial mixing or miscegenation, after all, was something that the Spanish and Portuguese had been accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans.

Similarly, later on, when African slaves were introduced into the Caribbean basin region, unions between them and Spaniards produced a population of ''mulatos'', who are a majority of the population in the Caribbean islands (the Antilles) (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico), as well as other areas of the Caribbean region (Colombia, Venezuela and parts of the Central American Caribbean coast). ''mestizos'' (sic) and ''mulatos'' may not have always have been first class citizens in their countries, but they were never disowned in the way the outcomes of unions of Europeans and Native Americans were in the British colonies, where interracial marriages were taboo and one drop of Black or Amerindian blood was enough to make the person 'impure'. 
}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/history.htm|title=Some historical background|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>

In his famous 1963 book ''[[The Rise of the West]]'', [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote that:

{{Quote
|text=Racially mixed societies arose in most of Spanish and Portuguese America, compounded in varying proportions from European, Indian, and Negro strands. Fairly frequent resort to manumission mitigated the hardships of slavery in those areas; and the Catholic church positively encouraged marriages between white immigrants and Indian women as a remedy for sexual immorality. However, in the southern English colonies and in most of the Caribbean islands, the importation of Negro slaves created a much more sharply polarized biracial society. Strong race feeling and the servile status of nearly all Negroes interdicted intermarriage, practically if not legally. Such discrimination did not prevent interbreeding; but children of mixed parentage were assigned to the status of their mothers. Mulattoes and Indian half-breeds were thereby excluded from the white community. In Spanish (and, with some differences, Portuguese) territories a more elaborate and less oppressive principle of racial discrimination established itself. The handful of persons who had been born in the homelands claimed topmost social prestige; next came those of purely European descent; while beneath ranged the various racial blends to form a social pyramid whose numerous racial distinctions meant that no one barrier could become as ugly and inpenetrable as that dividing whites from Negroes in the English, Dutch, and French colonies.
}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community|last=McNeill|first=William H.|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}, p. 603</ref>

Thomas C. Wright, meanwhile, has written that:

{{Quote
|text=The demographic makeup of colonial Latin America became more complex when, as the native population declined, the Portuguese, Spanish, and the French in Haiti turned to Africa for labor, as did the British in North America. The tricontinental heritage that characterizes Latin America, then, is shared by the United States, but even a casual examination reveals that the outcome of the complex interaction of different peoples has varied. While miscegenation among the three races certainly occurred in North America, it appears to have been much less common than in Latin America. Furthermore, offspring of such liaisons were not recognized as belonging to new, distinct racial categories in North America as they were in Latin America. The terms mestizo or ''mameluco'', mulatto, the general term ''castas'', and dozens of subcategories of racial identity frankly recognized the outcomes of interracial sexual activity in Latin America and established a continuum of race rather than the unrealistic absolute categories of white, black, or Indian as used in the United States. (The U.S. Census Bureau's forms did not allow individuals to list more than one race until 2000.)

===Language===
[[File:Map-Romance Latin America.svg|thumb|left|Linguistic map of Latin America. Spanish in green, Portuguese in orange, and French in blue.]]

Spanish is the predominant language of Latin America. It is spoken as first language by about 60% of the population. Portuguese is spoken by about 30%, and about 10% speak other languages such as Quechua, [[Mayan languages]], Guaraní, Aymara, Nahuatl, English, French, Dutch and Italian. Portuguese is spoken only in Brazil ([[Brazilian Portuguese]]), the biggest and most populous country in the region. Spanish is the official language of most of the rest of the countries and territories on the Latin American mainland ([[Spanish language in the Americas]]), as well as in [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] (where it is co-official with English), and the [[Dominican Republic]]. French is spoken in [[Haiti]] and in the French [[overseas department]]s of [[Guadeloupe]], Martinique and [[French Guiana|Guiana]]. It is also spoken by some Panamanians of Afro-Antillean descent. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language in [[Suriname]], [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]], and the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. (As Dutch is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], these territories are not necessarily considered part of Latin America.) However, the native language of Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and Curaçao, is [[Papiamento]], a creole language largely based on Portuguese and Spanish and has a considerable influence coming from the Dutch language and [[Portuguese-based creole languages]].

[[File:Map-Most Widely Spoken Native Languages in Latin America.png|thumb|'''{{color|blue|Quechua}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#f9dc38|Guaraní}}}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#ff9922|Aymara}}}}''', '''{{color|#cc0000|Náhuatl}}''', '''{{color|#006600|Lenguas Mayas}}''', '''Mapudungun''']]

[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] are widely spoken in [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]] and Mexico, and to a lesser degree, in [[Panama]], [[Ecuador]], Brazil, [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Argentina]], and Chile amongst other countries. In Latin American countries not named above, the population of speakers of indigenous languages tend to be very small or even non-existent (e.g. [[Uruguay]]). Mexico is possibly the only country that contains a wider variety of indigenous languages than any Latin American country, but the most spoken language is Nahuatl.

In [[Peru]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] is an official language, alongside Spanish and any other indigenous language in the areas where they predominate. In [[Ecuador]], while holding no official status, the closely related [[Quichua]] is a recognized language of the indigenous people under the country's constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country's highlands. In [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], Quechua and Guaraní hold official status alongside Spanish. [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]], along with Spanish, is an official language of [[Paraguay]], and is spoken by a majority of the population (who are, for the most part, bilingual), and it is co-official with Spanish in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of [[Corrientes]]. In [[Nicaragua]], Spanish is the official language, but on the country's Caribbean coast English and indigenous languages such as [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo languages|Sumo]], and [[Rama language|Rama]] also hold official status. [[Colombia]] recognizes all indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these languages. [[Nahuatl]] is one of the 62 native languages spoken by indigenous people in Mexico, which are officially recognized by the government as "national languages" along with Spanish.

Other European languages spoken in Latin America include: English, by some groups in [[Puerto Rico]], as well as in nearby countries that may or may not be considered Latin American, like [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]], and spoken by descendants of British settlers in Argentina & Chile; German, in southern Brazil, southern Chile, portions of [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Paraguay]]; Italian, in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and [[Uruguay]]; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and Russian in southern Brazil and Argentina; and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], in southern Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1163503 |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=July 22, 2008 |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1stclassargentina.com/tours/WelshImmigration.html|title=The Welsh Immigration to Argentina|work=1stclassargentina.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Howat |url=http://www.argbrit.org/Patagonia/patagonia_entry.htm |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Argbrit.org |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.patagonline.com/patagonia/destacados/peninsula-valdes/gaiman-trelew |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Patagonline.com |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andesceltig.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Andesceltig.com |date=September 29, 2009 |accessdate=April 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917174822/http://andesceltig.com/ |archive-date=September 17, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glaniad.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Glaniad.com |accessdate=April 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808130811/http://www.glaniad.com/ |archive-date=August 8, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In several nations, especially in the Caribbean region, [[creole languages]] are spoken. The most widely spoken creole language in Latin America and the Caribbean is [[Haitian Creole]], the predominant language of [[Haiti]]; it is derived primarily from French and certain West African tongues with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]], English, Portuguese and Spanish influences as well. Creole languages of mainland Latin America, similarly, are derived from European languages and various African tongues.

The [[Garifuna language]] is spoken along the Caribbean coast in [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Belize]] mostly by the [[Garifuna people]] a mixed race [[Zambo]] people who were the result of mixing between Indigenous Caribbeans and escaped Black slaves. Primarily an [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan language]], it has influences from Caribbean and European languages.

Archaeologists have deciphered over 15 pre-Columbian distinct writing systems from mesoamerican societies. the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] had the most sophisticated textually written language, but since texts were largely confined to the religious and administrative elite, traditions were passed down orally. oral traditions also prevailed in other major indigenous groups including, but not limited to the [[Aztecs]] and other [[Nahuatl]] speakers, [[Quechua people|Quechua]] and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] of the Andean regions, the [[K'iche' people|Quiché]] of Central America, the [[Tupi-Guaraní]] in today's Brazil, the [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] in Paraguay and the [[Mapuche]] in Chile.{{sfnp|Meade|2016|p=13}}

Due to economic, social and security developments that are affecting the region in recent decades, the focus is now the change from net immigration to net emigration.

During the initial stage of the [[History of the Philippines (1565–1898)|Spanish colonization of the Philippines]] which were around the 1600s, about 16,500 soldiers levied from [[Peru]] and Mexico were sent together with 600 Spanish officers to fight wars, settle, colonize and build cities and [[presidios]] in the [[Philippines]].<ref>Stephanie Mawson, ‘Between Loyalty and Disobedience: The Limits of Spanish Domination in the Seventeenth Century Pacific’ (Univ. of Sydney M.Phil. thesis, 2014), appendix 3.</ref> These 16,500 Peruvians and Mexicans supplemented the Native Malay Population which then reached 667,612 people.<ref>The Unlucky Country: The Republic of the Philippines in the 21st Century By Duncan Alexander McKenzie (Page xii)</ref> This initial group of Latin American soldier-settler founders had spread their genes among the sparsely populated Philippines.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16086/16086-h/16086-h.htm Letter from Fajardo to Felipe III From Manila, August 15 1620.(From the Spanish Archives of the Indies)]("The infantry does not amount to two hundred men, in three companies.

As a result of the [[2010 Haiti Earthquake]] and its social and economic impact, there was a significant migration of Haitians to other Latin American countries.

The countries of Latin America seek to strengthen links between migrants and their states of origin, while promoting their integration in the receiving state. These Emigrant Policies focus on the rights, obligations and opportunities for participation of emigrated citizens who already live outside the borders of the country of origin. Research on Latin America shows that the extension of policies towards migrants is linked to a focus on civil rights and state benefits that can positively influence integration in recipient countries. In addition, the tolerance of dual citizenship has spread more in Latin America than in any other region of the world.<ref>Pedroza, L.; Palop, P. y Hoffmann, B. (2018).

Despite significant progress, education access and school completion remains unequal in Latin America. The region has made great progress in educational coverage; almost all children attend primary school and access to secondary education has increased considerably. Quality issues such as poor teaching methods, lack of appropriate equipment and overcrowding exist throughout the region. These issues lead to adolescents dropping out of the educational system early.<ref name="Welti">{{cite book |last=Welti|first=Carlos|editor-first=B. |editor-last=Brown|chapter=Adolescents in Latin America: Facing the Future with Skepticism|title=The World's Youth: Adolescence in Eight Regions of the Globe|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0521006058|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref> Most educational systems in the region have implemented various types of administrative and institutional reforms that have enabled reach for places and communities that had no access to education services in the early 1990s. Compared to prior generations, Latin American youth have seen an increase in their levels of education. On average, they have completed two years schooling more than their parents.<ref name="Welti" />

However, there are still 23&nbsp;million children in the region between the ages of 4 and 17 outside of the formal education system. Estimates indicate that 30% of preschool age children (ages 4–5) do not attend school, and for the most vulnerable populations, the poor and rural, this calculation exceeds 40 percent. Among primary school age children (ages 6 to 12), coverage is almost universal; however there is still a need to incorporate 5&nbsp;million children in the primary education system. These children live mostly in remote areas, are indigenous or Afro-descendants and live in extreme poverty.<ref name=Survey>[BID/EDU Stakeholder Survey 1993/2003, February 8, 2011]</ref>

Among people between the ages of 13 and 17 years, only 80% are full-time students in the education system; among them only 66% advance to secondary school. These percentages are lower among vulnerable population groups: only 75% of the poorest youth between the ages of 13 and 17 years attend school. Tertiary education has the lowest coverage, with only 70% of people between the ages of 18 and 25 years outside of the education system. Currently, more than half of low income children or living in rural areas fail to complete nine years of education.<ref name=Survey/>

Crime and violence prevention and public security are now important issues for governments and citizens in Latin America and the Caribbean region. Homicide rates in Latin America are the highest in the world. From the early 1980s through the mid-1990s, homicide rates increased by 50 percent. Latin America and the Caribbean experienced more than 2.5&nbsp;million murders between 2000 and 2017.<ref>{{cite news |title=Latin America Is the Murder Capital of the World |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/400-murders-a-day-the-crisis-of-latin-america-1537455390 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 20, 2018}}</ref> There were a total of 63,880 murders in Brazil in 2018.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Year of Violence Sees Brazil's Murder Rate Hit Record High |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/world/americas/brazil-murder-rate-record.html |work=The New York Times |date=August 10, 2018}}</ref>

The major victims of such homicides are young men, 69 percent of whom are between the ages of 15 and 19 years old.

===Development===
Over the past two centuries, Latin America's GDP per capita has fluctuated around world average. However, there is a substantial gap between Latin America and the developed economies. In the Andean region this gap can be a consequence of low human capital among Inca Indios in Pre-Columbian times. It is evident that the numeracy value of Peruvian Indios in the early 16th century was just half of the numeracy of the Spanish and Portuguese.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Juif | first1=Dácil-Tania | last2=Baten | first2=Jörg | year=2013 | title=On the Human Capital of Inca Indios before and after the Spanish Conquest. Was there a "Pre-Colonial Legacy"? | url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:21-opus-60289}}</ref> Between 1820 and 2008, this gap widened from 0.8 to 2.7 times.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=123|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref> Since 1980, Latin America also lost growth versus the world average. Many nations such as those in Asia have joined others on a rapid economic growth path, but Latin America has grown at slower pace and its share of world output declined from 9.5% in 1980 to 7.8% in 2008.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=138|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref>

==== Standard of living ====
Latin America is the region with the highest levels of income inequality in the world.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=148f|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref> The following table lists all the countries in Latin America indicating a valuation of the country's [[Human Development Index]], GDP at purchasing power parity per capita, measurement of inequality through the [[Gini index]], measurement of poverty through the [[Human Poverty Index]], measurement of extreme poverty based on people living under 1.25 dollars a day, [[life expectancy]], murder rates and a measurement of safety through the [[Global Peace Index]]. Green cells indicate the best performance in each category while red indicates the lowest.

In Latin America, few countries achieve projection in industrial activity: Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and, less prominently, Chile. Begun late, the industrialization of these countries received a great boost from World War II: this prevented the countries at war from buying the products they were used to importing and exporting what they produced. At that time, benefiting from the abundant local raw material, the low wages paid to the labor force and a certain specialization brought by immigrants, countries such as Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, as well as Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and Peru, were able to implement important industrial parks. In general, in these countries there are industries that require little capital and simple technology for their installation, such as the food processing and textile industries. The basic industries (steel, etc.) also stand out, as well as the metallurgical and mechanical industries.

The industrial parks of Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile, however, present much greater diversity and sophistication, producing advanced technology items. In the rest of Latin American countries, mainly in Central America, the processing industries of primary products for export predominate.

In the [[food industry]], in 2019, [[Brazil]] was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alimentosprocessados.com.br/industria-na-sociedade-brasileira.php|title=Alimentos Processados {{pipe}} A indústria de alimentos e bebidas na sociedade brasileira atual|website=alimentosprocessados.com.br}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2020/02/18/faturamento-da-industria-de-alimentos-cresceu-67percent-em-2019.ghtml|title=Faturamento da indústria de alimentos cresceu 6,7% em 2019|website=G1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/economia/noticia/2020-02/industria-de-alimentos-e-bebidas-faturaram-r-6999-bi-em-2019|title=Indústria de alimentos e bebidas faturou R$699,9 bi em 2019|date=18 February 2020|website=Agência Brasil}}</ref> In 2016, the country was the 2nd largest producer of [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] in the world and the 8th producer of [[paper]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://valor.globo.com/empresas/noticia/2020/02/21/producao-nacional-de-celulose-cai-66percent-em-2019-aponta-iba.ghtml|title=Produção nacional de celulose cai 6,6% em 2019, aponta Ibá|website=Valor Econômico}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.celuloseonline.com.br/sabe-qual-e-o-estado-brasileiro-que-mais-produz-madeira-nao-e-sao-paulo/|title=Sabe qual é o estado brasileiro que mais produz Madeira?|date=9 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/espirito-santo/noticia/sao-mateus-e-o-6-maior-produtor-de-madeira-em-tora-para-papel-e-celulose-no-pais-diz-ibge.ghtml|title=São Mateus é o 6º maior produtor de madeira em tora para papel e celulose no país, diz IBGE|website=G1}}</ref> In the [[footwear industry]], in 2019, Brazil ranked 4th among world producers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/sp/ribeirao-preto-franca/noticia/2019/07/14/industrias-calcadistas-em-franca-sp-registram-queda-de-40percent-nas-vagas-de-trabalho-em-6-anos.ghtml|title=Indústrias calçadistas em Franca, SP registram queda de 40% nas vagas de trabalho em 6 anos|website=G1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fenac.com.br/producao-de-calcados-deve-crescer-3-em-2019|title=Fenac – Centro de Eventos e Negócios {{pipe}} Produção de calçados deve crescer 3% em 2019|first=Agência Maya: Criação de Sites e Marketing|last=Digital|website=fenac.com.br}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abicalcados.com.br/noticia/abicalcados-apresenta-relatorio-setorial-2019|title=Abicalçados apresenta Relatório Setorial 2019|website=abicalcados.com.br}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fazcomex.com.br/blog/exportacao-de-calcados-saiba-mais/|title=Exportação de Calçados: Saiba mais|date=27 February 2020}}</ref> In 2019, the country was the 8th producer of [[vehicles]] and the 9th producer of [[steel]] in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diariodocomercio.com.br/livre/minas-gerais-produz-323-do-aco-nacional-em-2019/|title=Minas Gerais produz 32,3% do aço nacional em 2019|first=Diário do|last=Comércio|date=24 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/o-novo-mapa-das-montadoras/|title=O novo mapa das montadoras, que agora rumam para o interior do País|date=8 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/sul-do-rio-costa-verde/noticia/industria-automobilistica-do-sul-do-rio-impulsiona-superavit-na-economia.ghtml|title=Indústria automobilística do Sul do Rio impulsiona superavit na economia|website=G1}}</ref> In 2018, the [[chemical industry]] of Brazil was the 8th in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com.br/pt/publicacoes/setores-atividade/assets/quimico-petroquimico/2013/pwc-chemicals-port-13.pdf|title=Indústria Química no Brasil}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/br/Documents/energy-resources/Deloitte-Abiquim-Setor-Quimico-Relatorio.pdf|title=Estudo de 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://economia.uol.com.br/noticias/estadao-conteudo/2020/02/03/producao-nacional-da-industria-de-quimicos-cai-57-em-2019-diz-abiquim.htm|title=Produção nacional da indústria de químicos cai 5,7% em 2019, diz Abiquim|website=economia.uol.com.br}}</ref> In [[textile industry]], Brazil, although it was among the 5 largest world producers in 2013, is very little integrated in world trade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnb.gov.br/documents/80223/2509338/textil_16_2017%28V2%29.pdf/063d7521-342f-e81e-232a-e251964fa1c3|title=Industria Textil no Brasil}}</ref> In the aviation sector, Brazil has [[Embraer]], the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, behind [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]].

Transport in Latin America is basically carried out using the [[road]] mode, the most developed in the region. There is also a considerable infrastructure of [[ports]] and [[airports]]. The [[railway]] and [[fluvial]] sector, although it has potential, is usually treated in a secondary way.

Brazil has more than 1.7&nbsp;million km of [[roads]], of which 215,000 km are paved, and about 14,000&nbsp;km are [[dual carriageway|divided highways]].

Due to the [[Andes Mountains]], [[Amazon River]] and [[Amazon Forest]], there have always been difficulties in implementing transcontinental or bioceanic highways. Practically the only route that existed was the one that connected Brazil to Buenos Aires, in Argentina and later to Santiago, in Chile. However, in recent years, with the combined effort of countries, new routes have started to emerge, such as Brazil-Peru ([[Interoceanic Highway]]), and a new highway between Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile ([[Central Bi-Oceanic railway|Bioceanic Corridor]]).

The Brazilian [[railway]] network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It's basically used for transporting ores.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html The World Factbook — Central Intelligence]</ref> The Argentine rail network, with 47,000 km of tracks, was one of the largest in the world and continues to be the most extensive in Latin America. It came to have about 100,000&nbsp;km of rails, but the lifting of tracks and the emphasis placed on motor transport gradually reduced it. It has four different trails and international connections with Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay. Chile has almost 7,000&nbsp;km of railways, with connections to Argentina, Bolivia and Peru. Colombia has only about 3,500&nbsp;km of railways.<ref>[https://www.mintransporte.gov.co/Servicios/Estadisticas/DIAGNOSTICO_TRANSPORTE_2008.pdf Diagnostico Transporte]</ref>

Among the main Brazilian [[waterways]], two stand out: [[Hidrovia Tietê-Paraná]] (which has a length of 2,400 km, 1,600 on the Paraná River and 800&nbsp;km on the Tietê River, draining agricultural production from the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás and part of Rondônia, Tocantins and Minas General) and [[Hidrovia do Solimões-Amazonas]] (it has two sections: Solimões, which extends from Tabatinga to Manaus, with approximately 1600 km, and Amazonas, which extends from Manaus to Belém, with 1650 km. Almost entirely passenger transport from the Amazon plain is done by this waterway, in addition to practically all cargo transportation that is directed to the major regional centers of Belém and Manaus). In Brazil, this transport is still underutilized: the most important waterway stretches, from an economic point of view, are found in the Southeast and South of the country. Its full use still depends on the construction of locks, major dredging works and, mainly, of ports that allow intermodal integration. In [[Argentina]], the waterway network is made up of the La Plata, Paraná, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers. The main river ports are [[Zárate, Buenos Aires|Zárate]] and [[Campana Partido|Campana]]. The port of Buenos Aires is historically the first in individual importance, but the area known as Up-River, which stretches along 67 km of the Santa Fé portion of the Paraná River, brings together 17 ports that concentrate 50% of the total exports of the country.

The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8&nbsp;million barrels / day. Production manages to supply the country's demand.<ref>[https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world/petroleum-and-other-liquids/annual-petroleum-and-other-liquids-production?pd=5&p=0000000000000000000000000000000000vg&u=0&f=A&v=mapbubble&a=-&i=none&vo=value&&t=C&g=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001&l=249-ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1vrvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvvnvvvs0008&s=94694400000&e=1546300800000  Production of Crude Oil including Lease Condensate 2019]</ref> In the beginning of 2020, in the production of [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]], the country exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time.

Brazil is one of the main world producers of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]]. In 2019, Brazil had 217 hydroelectric plants in operation, with an installed capacity of 98,581 MW, 60.16% of the country's energy generation.<ref> [https://cbie.com.br/artigos/quantas-usinas-geradoras-de-energia-temos-no-brasil/ How many power plants do we have in Brazil?]</ref> In the total generation of electricity, in 2019 Brazil reached 170,000 megawatts of installed capacity, more than 75% from renewable sources (the majority, hydroelectric).<ref>[https://www.aneel.gov.br/sala-de-imprensa-exibicao/-/asset_publisher/XGPXSqdMFHrE/content/brasil-alcanca-170-mil-megawatts-de-capacidade-instalada-em-2019/656877?inheritRedirect=false Brasil alcança 170 mil megawatts de capacidade instalada em 2019]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180401075849/http://www.energiaeambiente.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IEMA-AGUA_vFinal.pdf IEMA (Instituto de Energia e Meio Ambiente),2016.Série TERMOELETRICIDADE EM FOCO: Uso de água em termoelétricas]</ref>

In 2013, the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Region]] used about 50% of the load of the National Integrated System (SIN), being the main energy consuming region in the country. The region's installed electricity generation capacity totaled almost 42,500 MW, which represented about a third of Brazil's generation capacity. The [[hydroelectric]] generation represented 58% of the region's installed capacity, with the remaining 42% corresponding basically to the [[thermoelectric]] generation. São Paulo accounted for 40% of this capacity; Minas Gerais by about 25%; Rio de Janeiro by 13.3%; and Espírito Santo accounted for the rest. The [[South Region, Brazil|South Region]] owns the [[Itaipu Dam]], which was the largest hydroelectric plant in the world for several years, until the inauguration of [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China. It remains the second largest operating [[hydroelectric]] in the world. Brazil is the co-owner of the Itaipu Plant with [[Paraguay]]: the dam is located on the [[Paraná River]], located on the border between countries. It has an installed generation capacity of 14 [[Watt | GW]] for 20 generating units of 700 [[Watt | MW]] each. [[North Region, Brazil|North Region]] has large hydroelectric plants, such as [[Belo Monte Dam]] and [[Tucuruí Dam]], which produce much of the national energy. Brazil's hydroelectric potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory.<ref>[https://web.bndes.gov.br/bib/jspui/bitstream/1408/4401/1/O%20BNDES%20e%20a%20quest%C3%A3o%20energ%C3%A9tica%20e%20logistica%20na%20Regi%C3%A3o%20Sudeste_5_P.pdf O BNDES e a questão energética e  logística da Região Sudeste]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060519000659/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hybiggest.html Power: World's biggest hydroelectric facility]</ref>

==Inequality==
{{Main|Wealth inequality in Latin America}}

[[Wealth inequality]] in Latin America and the [[Caribbean]] remains a serious issue despite strong economic growth and improved social indicators over the past decade. A report released in 2013 by the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] entitled ''Inequality Matters. Report of the World Social Situation'', observed that: ‘Declines in the wage share have been attributed to the impact of labour-saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market regulations and institutions.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|pages=24, Box 1}}</ref> Such declines are likely to affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.’ In addition, the report noted that ‘highly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity, while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/publications/world-social-situation-2013.html|title=Report on World Social Situation 2013: Inequality Matters.|publisher=United Nations|year=2013|isbn=978-92-1-130322-3}}</ref>

These are nominal categories, and neither güero/blanco nor criollo is a widely used term (see Nutini 1997: 230). Nevertheless, there is a popular consensus in Mexico today that these four categories represent major sectors of the nation and that they can be arranged into a rough hierarchy: whites and creoles at the top, a vast population of mestizos in the middle, and Indians (perceived as both a racial and an ethnic component) at the bottom. This popular hierarchy does not constitute a stratificational system or even a set of social classes, however, because its categories are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. While very light skin is indeed characteristic of the country's elite, there is no "white" (güero) class. Rather, the superordinate stratum is divided into four real classes—aristocracy, plutocracy, political class, and the crème of the upper-middle class—or, for some purposes, into ruling, political, and prestige classes (see Chap. 4). Nor is there a mestizo class, as phenotypical mestizos are found in all classes, though only rarely among the aristocracy and very frequently in the middle and lower classes. Finally, the bottom rungs are not constituted mainly of Indians, except in some localized areas, such as the Sierra Norte de Puebla}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last= Acuña |first= Rodolfo F. |author-link= Rodolfo F.

The major trade blocs (or agreements) in the region are the [[Pacific Alliance]] and [[Mercosur]]. Minor blocs or trade agreements are the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]], the [[Dominican Republic – Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (DR-CAFTA), the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) and the [[Andean Community of Nations]] (CAN). However, major reconfigurations are taking place along opposing approaches to integration and trade; Venezuela has officially withdrawn from both the CAN and G3 and it has been formally admitted into the Mercosur (pending ratification from the Paraguayan legislature). The president-elect of Ecuador has manifested his intentions of following the same path. This bloc nominally opposes any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, although Uruguay has manifested its intention otherwise. Chile, [[Peru]], [[Colombia]] and Mexico are the only four Latin American nations that have an FTA with the United States and Canada, both members of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).

Latin American culture is a mixture of many cultural expressions worldwide. It is the product of many diverse influences:

* [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] cultures of the people who inhabited the continent prior to European Colonization. Ancient and very advanced civilizations developed their own political, social and religious systems. The [[Maya civilization|Mayas]], the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca civilization|Incas]] are examples of these. Indigenous legacies in music, dance, foods, arts and crafts, clothing, folk culture and traditions are very strong in Latin America. Linguistic effects on Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are also marked, such as in terms like [[pampa]], [[taco]], [[tamale]], [[cacique]].
* [[Western culture|Western civilization]], in particular the [[culture of Europe]], was brought mainly by the colonial powers{{spaced ndash}}the Spanish, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and French{{spaced ndash}}between the 16th and 19th centuries. The most enduring European colonial influence is language and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. More recently, additional cultural influences came from the United States and Europe during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, due to the growing influence of the former on the world stage and immigration from the latter. The influence of the United States is particularly strong in northern Latin America, especially Puerto Rico, which is an American territory. Prior to 1959, Cuba, who fought for its independence along American soldiers in the [[Spanish–American War]], was also known to have a close socioeconomic relation with the United States. In addition, the United States also helped Panama become an independent state from Colombia and built the twenty-mile-long [[Panama Canal Zone]] in Panama which held from 1903 (the [[Panama Canal]] opened to transoceanic freight traffic in 1914) to 1999, when the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]] restored Panamanian control of the Canal Zone. South America experienced waves of immigration of Europeans, especially Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Russians, Croatians, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews. With the end of colonialism, [[Culture of France|French culture]] was also able to exert a direct influence in Latin America, especially in the realms of [[high culture]], science and medicine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stepan|first=Nancy Leys |title="The Hour of Eugenics": Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |location=Ithaca |pages=in passim |no-pp=true |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NuUxkMC1ePYC |isbn=978-0-8014-9795-7}}</ref> This can be seen in any expression of the region's artistic traditions, including painting, literature and music, and in the realms of science and politics. 
Due to the impact of Enlightenment ideals after the French revolution, a certain number of Iberian-American countries decriminalized homosexuality after France and French territories in the Americas in 1791. Some of the countries that abolished sodomy laws or banned any reference to state interference in consensual adult sexuality in the 19th century were Dominican Republic (1822), Brazil (1824), Peru (1836), Mexico (1871), Paraguay (1880), Argentina (1887), Honduras (1899), Guatemala and El Salvador. Today same-sex marriage is legal in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Uruguay, and French overseas departments, as well as in several states of Mexico. Civil unions can be held in Chile.

* [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]], whose presence derives from a long history of [[Atlantic slave trade|New World slavery]]. Peoples of African descent have influenced the ethno-scapes of Latin America and the Caribbean. This is manifested for instance in music, dance and religion, especially in countries like Brazil, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Haiti, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Cuba.
* [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], whose part of the presence derives from the long history of the [[Coolie|Coolie trade]] mostly arriving during the 19th and 20th centuries, and most commonly Chinese workers in Peru and Venezuela. But also from Japanese and Korean immigration especially headed to Brazil. This has largely affected the cuisine, traditions including literature, art and lifestyles and politics. The effects of Asian influences have especially and mostly effected the nations of Brazil, Cuba, Panama and Peru.

Beyond the rich tradition of indigenous art, the development of Latin American visual art owed much to the influence of Spanish, Portuguese and French Baroque painting, which in turn often followed the trends of the Italian Masters. In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.

[[File:Santiago Martinez Delgado in the colombian congress.jpg|thumb|right|Mural by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] in the [[Colombian Congress]]]]

From the early twentieth century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Barreiro |first=Gabriel|date=December 1994|title=Constructivism in Latin America |journal=University of Essex Collection of Latin American Art}}</ref> The Movement quickly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America.

Avant-Garde Prototypes|website=Issuu|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>

An important artistic movement generated in Latin America is ''[[muralism]]'' represented by [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] in Mexico, [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] in Colombia and [[Antonio Berni]] in Argentina. Some of the most impressive ''Muralista'' works can be found in Mexico, [[Colombia]], New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles and [[Philadelphia]].

Painter [[Frida Kahlo]], one of the most famous Mexican artists, painted about her own life and the Mexican culture in a style combining [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Surrealism]]. Kahlo's work commands the highest selling price of all Latin American paintings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frida Kahlo "Roots" Sets $5.6 Million Record at Sotheby's |url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/Frida_Kahlo_Roots_$5.6_Million_Record-at-Sothebys.html |publisher=Art Knowledge News |accessdate=September 23, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620174806/http://www.artknowledgenews.com/Frida_Kahlo_Roots_%245.6_Million_Record-at-Sothebys.html |archive-date=June 20, 2007 }}</ref>

The Venezuelan [[Armando Reverón]], whose work begins to be recognized internationally, is one of the most important artists of the 20th century in South America; he is a precursor of [[Arte Povera]] and [[Happening]]. From the 60s the kinetic art emerges in Venezuela, its main representatives are [[Jesús Soto]], [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]], [[Alejandro Otero]] and [[Gego]].

Colombian sculptor and painter [[Fernando Botero]] is also widely known<ref>{{cite web|author=Notimex / El Siglo De Torreón |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/725150.fernando-botero-el-gran-artista-de-latinoamerica.html |title=Fernando Botero, el gran artista de Latinoamérica |publisher=Elsiglodetorreon.com.mx |date=April 1, 2012 |accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revistaenie.clarin.com/arte/pintura/Fernando-Botero-MNBA_0_934106624.html |title=Fernando Botero, el aprendiz eterno |publisher=Revistaenie.clarin.com |date=October 6, 2013 |accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/international/americas/08botero.html |work=The New York Times |first=Juan |last=Forero |title='Great Crime' at Abu Ghraib Enrages and Inspires an Artist |date=May 8, 2005}}</ref>{{By whom|date=May 2013}} by his works which, on first examination, are noted for their exaggerated proportions and the corpulence of the human and animal figures.

===Film===

[[File:Guadalajara international Film Festival.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Guadalajara International Film Festival]] is considered the most prestigious film festival in Latin America.]]

Latin American film is both rich and diverse. Historically, the main centers of production have been Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba.  Latin American film flourished after sound was introduced in cinema, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border.<ref>Paul A. Schroeder Rodriguez. ''Latin American Cinema: A Comparative History'' (University of California Press; 2016) studies 50 films since the silent era.</ref>
[[File:Alejandro Inarritu Cannes 2017.jpg|right|upright|thumb|In 2015, [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]] became the second Mexican director in a row to win both the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award]] and the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] for Best Director. He won his second [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 2016 for ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]''.]]

[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] started out in the silent era from 1896 to 1929 and flourished in the [[Golden age of the cinema of Mexico|Golden Era]] of the 1940s. It boasted a huge industry comparable to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] at the time with stars such as [[María Félix]], [[Dolores del Río]], and [[Pedro Infante]]. In the 1970s, <!-- and 1970s --> Mexico was the location for many cult horror and action movies. More recently, films such as ''[[Amores Perros]]'' (2000) and ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'' (2001) enjoyed box office and critical acclaim and propelled [[Alfonso Cuarón]] and [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]] to the front rank of Hollywood directors. Alejandro González Iñárritu directed in 2010 ''[[Biutiful]]'' and [[Birdman (film)|''Birdman'']] (2014), Alfonso Cuarón directed ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013).  Close friend of both, [[Guillermo del Toro]], a top rank Hollywood director in Hollywood and Spain, directed ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (2006) and produced ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|El Orfanato]]'' (2007). [[Carlos Carrera]] (''[[The Crime of Father Amaro (film)|The Crime of Father Amaro]])'', and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are also some of the most known present-day Mexican film makers. ''[[Rudo y Cursi]]'' released in December (2008) in Mexico was directed by [[Carlos Cuarón]].
[[File:Cristina, elenco y Oscar.jpg|left|thumb|President [[Cristina Fernández]] with the film director [[Juan José Campanella]] and the cast of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009) with the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film]]]]

[[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine cinema]] has also been prominenent since the first half of the 20th century and today averages over 60 full-length titles yearly. The industry suffered during the [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional|1976–1983 military dictatorship]]; but re-emerged to produce the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[The Official Story]]'' in 1985. A wave of imported U.S. films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentine economic crisis]] around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including ''[[Nueve reinas]]'' (2000), ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (2001), ''[[El abrazo partido]]'' (2004), ''[[El otro]]'' (2007), the 2010 Foreign Language [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[El secreto de sus ojos]]'' and ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (2014).

[[Cinema of Brazil|In Brazil]], the ''[[Cinema Novo]]'' movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States, with movies such as ''[[Central do Brasil (film)|Central do Brasil]]'' (1999), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|Cidade de Deus]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (2007).

[[Cinema of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican cinema]] has produced some notable films, such as ''[[Una Aventura Llamada Menudo]]'', ''[[Los Diaz de Doris]]'' and ''[[Casi Casi]]''. An influx of Hollywood films affected the local film industry in Puerto Rico during the 1980s and 1990s, but several Puerto Rican films have been produced since and it has been recovering.

[[Cinema of Cuba|Cuban cinema]] has enjoyed much official support since the [[Cuban revolution]] and important film-makers include [[Tomás Gutiérrez Alea]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Latin American literature}}
{{See also|List of Latin American writers}}

[[File:Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1772).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] in 1772 by Andrés de Islas]]
[[File:Jorge Luis Borges Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Argentine [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in [[L'Hôtel]], Paris in 1969]]

Pre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate [[Aztec codices|codices]]. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the [[Popol Vuh]]. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]-speaking population of Peru and the [[K'iche' people|Quiché (K'iche')]] of Guatemala.

From the very moment of Europe's discovery of the continents, early explorers and [[conquistadores]] produced written accounts and crónicas of their experience{{spaced ndash}}such as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s letters or [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]'s description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive [[Criollo (people)|criollo]] literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's ''[[El Periquillo Sarniento]]'' (1816).

The 19th century was a period of "foundational fictions" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of "civilization or barbarism" (for which see, say, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Domingo Sarmiento]]'s ''[[Facundo]]'' (1845), [[Juan León Mera]]'s ''Cumandá'' (1879), or [[Euclides da Cunha]]'s ''[[Os Sertões]]'' (1902)). The 19th century also witnessed the realist work of [[Machado de Assis]], who made use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction, much admired by critic [[Harold Bloom]].

At the turn of the 20th century, ''[[modernismo]]'' emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet [[Rubén Darío]]'s ''Azul'' (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. [[José Martí]], for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.

[[File:Gabriela Mistral-01.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Chilean poet [[Gabriela Mistral]], first Latin American to win a [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], in 1945]]
[[File:Gabogarciamarquez1.png|thumb|right|upright|[[García Márquez]] signing a copy of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'']]

However, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary [[Latin American Boom|boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as [[Julio Cortázar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude|Cien años de soledad]]'' (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with [[magic realism]], though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]] do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s monumental ''Yo, el supremo'' (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and above all [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also rediscovered.

Contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling [[Paulo Coelho]] and [[Isabel Allende]] to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as [[Diamela Eltit]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Ricardo Piglia]], or [[Roberto Bolaño]]. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of [[Testimony#Literature|testimonio]], texts produced in collaboration with [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] subjects such as [[Rigoberta Menchú]]. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic [[Carlos Monsiváis]] and Pedro Lemebel.

The region boasts six [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize winners]]: in addition to the two Chilean poets [[Gabriela Mistral]] (1945) and [[Pablo Neruda]] (1971), there is also the Guatemalan novelist [[Miguel Angel Asturias]] (1967), the Colombian writer [[Gabriel García Márquez]] (1982), the Mexican poet and essayist [[Octavio Paz]] (1990), and the Peruvian novelist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (2010).

===Music and dance===

[[File:Salsa en Cali.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] dancing in [[Cali]], [[Colombia]]]]

Latin America has produced many successful worldwide artists in terms of recorded global music sales. Among the most successful have been [[Juan Gabriel]] (Mexico) only Latin American musician to have sold over 200&nbsp;million records worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|title=Juan Gabriel, superstar Mexican singer, dies at 66|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-juan-gabriel-20160828-snap-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}</ref> [[Gloria Estefan]] (Cuba), [[Carlos Santana]], [[Luis Miguel]] (Mexico) of whom have sold over 90&nbsp;million records, [[Shakira]] (Colombia) and [[Vicente Fernández]] (Mexico) with over 50&nbsp;million records sold worldwide. [[Enrique Iglesias]], although not a Latin American, has also contributed for the success of Latin music.

Other notable successful mainstream acts through the years, include [[RBD]], [[Celia Cruz]], [[Soda Stereo]], [[Thalía]], [[Ricky Martin]], [[Maná]], [[Marc Anthony]], [[Ricardo Arjona]], [[Selena]], and [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]].

Caribbean Hispanic music, such as [[Merengue (music)|merengue]], [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], and more recently [[reggaeton]], from such countries as the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba, and Panama, has been strongly influenced by African rhythms and melodies. Haiti's [[compas]] is a genre of music that is influenced by its Caribbean Hispanic counterparts, along with elements of jazz and modern sounds.<ref>{{cite web|author= Christopher Washburne |publisher=University of Salsa |title=Clave: The African Roots of Salsa |accessdate=May 23, 2006 |url=http://www.planetsalsa.com/university_of_salsa/clave/clave_roots.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Caravan Music |title=Guide to Latin Music |url=http://www.caravanmusic.com/GuideLatinMusic.htm |accessdate=May 23, 2006}}</ref>
[[File:JarabeTapatio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Traditional Mexican dance [[Jarabe Tapatío]]]]

Another well-known Latin American musical genre includes the [[Argentine tango|Argentine]] and [[Uruguayan tango]] (with [[Carlos Gardel]] as the greatest exponent), as well as the distinct [[nuevo tango]], a fusion of tango, [[acoustic music|acoustic]] and [[electronic music]] popularized by [[bandoneón]] virtuoso [[Ástor Piazzolla]]. [[Samba]], North American [[jazz]], [[European classical music]] and [[choro]] combined to form ''[[bossa nova]]'' in Brazil, popularized by guitarist [[João Gilberto]] with singer [[Astrud Gilberto]] and [[jazz piano|pianist]] [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]].

Other influential Latin American sounds include the Antillean [[soca music|soca]] and [[calypso music|calypso]], the Honduran (Garifuna) [[punta]], the Colombian [[cumbia]] and [[vallenato]], the Chilean [[cueca]], the Ecuadorian [[boleros music|boleros]], and [[rockoleras]], the Mexican [[ranchera]] and the [[mariachi]] which is the epitome of Mexican soul, the Nicaraguan [[palo de Mayo]], the Peruvian [[marinera]] and [[tondero]], the Uruguayan [[candombe]], the French Antillean [[Zouk (musical movement)|zouk]] (derived from Haitian compas) and the various styles of music from pre-Columbian traditions that are widespread in the [[Andean]] region.

[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Brazilian singer [[Carmen Miranda]] helped popularize [[samba]] internationally.]]

The classical composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] (1887–1959) worked on the recording of native musical traditions within his homeland of Brazil. The traditions of his homeland heavily influenced his classical works.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Leadership Medica |title=Heitor Villa-Lobos |accessdate=May 23, 2006 |url=http://www.cesil.com/0998/enbass09.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811081605/http://www.cesil.com/0998/enbass09.htm |archive-date=August 11, 2006 }}</ref> Also notable is the recent work of the Cuban [[Leo Brouwer]] and guitar work of the Venezuelan [[Antonio Lauro]] and the Paraguayan [[Agustín Barrios]]. Latin America has also produced world-class classical performers such as the Chilean pianist [[Claudio Arrau]], Brazilian pianist [[Nelson Freire]] and the Argentine pianist and conductor [[Daniel Barenboim]]. Brazilian opera soprano [[Bidu Sayão]], one of Brazil's most famous musicians, was a leading artist of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1937 to 1952.

[[File:Tango-Show-Buenos-Aires-01.jpg|thumb|upright|A couple dances [[Tango (dance)|tango]].]]

Arguably, the main contribution to music entered through folklore, where the true soul of the Latin American and Caribbean countries is expressed. Musicians such as [[Yma Súmac]], [[Chabuca Granda]], [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[Víctor Jara]], [[Jorge Cafrune]], [[Facundo Cabral]], [[Mercedes Sosa]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Luiz Gonzaga]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Susana Baca]], [[Chavela Vargas]], [[Simon Diaz]], [[Julio Jaramillo]], [[Toto la Momposina]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Maria Bethânia]], [[Nana Caymmi]], [[Nara Leão]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Ney Matogrosso]] as well as musical ensembles such as [[Inti Illimani]] and [[Los Kjarkas]] are magnificent examples of the heights that this soul can reach.

[[Latin pop]], including many forms of rock, is popular in Latin America today (see [[Spanish language rock and roll]]).<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Michigan Daily |title=Latin music returns to America with wave of new pop starlets |url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1999/sep/09-28-99/arts/arts6.html |accessdate=May 23, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830190254/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1999/sep/09-28-99/arts/arts6.html |archive-date=August 30, 2005}}</ref> A few examples are [[Café Tacuba]], [[Soda Stereo]], [[Maná]], [[Rita Lee]], [[Mutantes]], [[Secos e Molhados]] [[Legião Urbana]], [[Titãs]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], [[Cazuza]], [[Barão Vermelho]], [[Skank (band)|Skank]], [[Miranda!]], [[CSS (band)|Cansei de Ser Sexy or CSS]], and Bajo Fondo.

More recently, reggaeton, which blends Jamaican reggae and dancehall with Latin America genres such as [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]] and [[plena]], as well as [[hip hop]], is becoming more popular, in spite of the controversy surrounding its lyrics, dance steps ([[Perreo]]) and music videos. It has become very popular among populations with a "migrant culture" influence&nbsp;– both Latino populations in the United States, such as southern Florida and New York City, and parts of Latin America where migration to the United States is common, such as Trinidad and Tobago, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Mexico.<ref>{{Cite news|agency=Associated Press |title=Daddy Yankee leads the reggaeton charge |accessdate=May 23, 2006 |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/daddy-yankee-leads-reggaeton-charge-wbna9410287}}</ref>
