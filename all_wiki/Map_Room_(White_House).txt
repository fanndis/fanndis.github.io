The '''Map Room''' is a room on the ground floor of the [[White House]], the official home of the [[President of the United States]].

The Map Room takes its name from its use during World War II, when [[Franklin Roosevelt]] used it as a situation room where maps were consulted to track the war's progress (for such purposes it was later replaced by the [[West Wing]] [[White House Situation Room|Situation Room]]). The room was originally finished as part of the extensive renovation of the White House designed by the architectural firm of [[McKim, Mead, and White]] in the administration of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]; the former basement billiard room was made into a formal space. In the Truman reconstruction of the White House (1949â€“1952), the room was paneled in the late Georgian style with wood sawn from the 1816 load-bearing timbers of the house. In the Kennedy administration the room was used by the newly created [[Curator of the White House]] as an office, used to catalog donations of furniture and objects. Under the leadership of First Lady [[Pat Nixon]], working with Curator [[Clement Conger]], the room underwent a major redecoration in 1970, transforming it from an office to the parlor which remains today. The room was redecorated again in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whitehousemuseum.org/floor0/map-room.htm |title=Map Room |publisher=White House Museum |date=1945-04-03 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>

The Map Room is furnished in the style of English cabinetmaker [[Thomas Chippendale]] and includes two stuffed-back armchairs that may have been built by Philadelphia cabinetmaker [[Thomas Affleck]]. Today the room is used for television interviews, small teas, and social gatherings.
