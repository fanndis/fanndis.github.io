[[File:Seth MacFarlane 2012 cropped and retouched.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Seth MacFarlane]] hosted the 85th Academy Awards|alt=Seth MacFarlane in 2012.]]

Due to declining interest and viewership in recent ceremonies, the Academy hired a new production team in an attempt to improve ratings and revive interest in the ceremony. Reports surfaced that Academy then-president [[Tom Sherak]] approached television producer [[Lorne Michaels]] for producing duties with actor and comedian [[Jimmy Fallon]] as host.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sperling |first=Nicole |title=Jimmy Fallon in talks to host 2013 Oscars, but ABC said to object |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/02/entertainment/la-et-mn-jimmy-fallon-in-talks-to-host-2013-oscars-lorne-michaels-to-produce-20120802 |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 2, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227211817/http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/02/entertainment/la-et-mn-jimmy-fallon-in-talks-to-host-2013-oscars-lorne-michaels-to-produce-20120802 |archivedate=February 27, 2013 }}</ref> However, the telecast's broadcaster [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] objected to these selections, and both men declined afterward.<ref>{{cite news|last=Newcomb |first=Tim |title=Jimmy Fallon as Oscar Host?

===Box office performance of nominated films===
None of the nine Best Picture nominees were among the top ten releases in box office during the nominations. However, four of those films had already earned $100 million in American and Canadian ticket sales.<ref>{{cite news|last=Coker |first=Lesleyann |title=Lincoln Dominates Oscar Nominations and History is Made |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesleyanncoker/2013/01/10/lincoln-dominates-oscar-nominations-and-history-is-made/ |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=January 10, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413123743/http://www.forbes.com/sites/lesleyanncoker/2013/01/10/lincoln-dominates-oscar-nominations-and-history-is-made/ |archivedate=April 13, 2014 }}</ref> At the time of the announcement of nominations on January 10, ''Lincoln'' was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $144 million in domestic box office receipts.

=== "We Saw Your Boobs" controversy ===
During the opening monologue, MacFarlane is told by [[James T. Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]]) (Captain Kirk set in the next day) about how he was going to ruin the telecast, Captain Kirk then shows him a video where MacFarlane sings a song about actresses in the movies in which they were disrobed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/24/entertainment/la-et-ms-oscars-2013-celebration-music-starts-we-saw-your-boobs-201302243|title=Oscars 2013: Celebration of music starts with 'We Saw Your Boobs'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 28, 2016|accessdate=February 29, 2016}}</ref> In response to the segment, California assemblywoman [[Bonnie Lowenthal]] and state senator [[Hannah-Beth Jackson]] expressed their disappointment at MacFarlane, ABC, and AMPAS in a press release reading, "Furthermore, there was a disturbing theme about violence against women being acceptable and funny. From topical jabs about domestic violence to singing about 'boobs' during a film's rape scene, Seth MacFarlane crossed the line from humor to misogyny."<ref>{{cite news |title=Seth MacFarlane's Oscars performance condemned by two California state lawmakers |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seth-macfarlanes-oscars-performance-condemned-by-two-california-state-lawmakers/ |date=February 27, 2013 |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |publisher=[[CBS News]]}}</ref> [[Amy Davidson (author)|Amy Davidson]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' interpreted the song as hostile to women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/seth-macfarlane-and-the-oscars-hostile-ugly-sexist-night |title=Seth MacFarlane and the Oscars' Hostile, Ugly, Sexist Night |work=[[The New Yorker]] |author=Davidson, Amy |date=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803130001/http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/seth-macfarlane-and-the-oscars-hostile-ugly-sexist-night |archivedate=August 3, 2014 }}</ref> Actresses [[Lena Dunham]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Geena Davis]], and [[Jane Fonda]] also commented on the jokes, with Fonda stating: "What I really didn't like was the song and dance number about seeing actresses' boobs. I agree with someone who said, if they want to stoop to that, why not list all the penises weâ€™ve seen? Better yet, remember that this is a telecast seen around the world watched by families with their children and to many this is neither appropriate or funny."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/jane-fonda-seth-macfarlane-boobs_n_2783839.html|title=Jane Fonda On Seth MacFarlane's 'We Saw Your Boobs': 'Why Not List All The Penises We've Seen?'|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=February 24, 2013|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In a press release statement, the Academy defended MacFarlane for expressing his artistic freedom, "If the Oscars are about anything, they're about creative freedom. We think the show's producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, and host Seth MacFarlane did a great job and we hope our worldwide audience found the show entertaining."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lang |first1=Brent |title=Academy Defends Seth MacFarlane Despite Charges of Sexism |url=https://www.thewrap.com/academy-defends-seth-macfarlane-despite-charges-sexism-79641/ |accessdate=March 1, 2013 |work=TheWrap |date=February 28, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723211403/https://www.thewrap.com/academy-defends-seth-macfarlane-despite-charges-sexism-79641/ |archivedate=July 23, 2016}}</ref>

=== Critical reviews ===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Columnist [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented "By calling constant attention to the naughty factor", MacFarlane created "an echo chamber of outrage, working a little too hard to top himself with faux-scandalous gags about race, Jews in Hollywood, and the killing of Abraham Lincoln."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=This year's Academy Awards: a lively, occasionally uneasy mixture of snark and sincerity |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/02/25/this-years-oscars-snark-meets-sincerity/ |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=February 25, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927190014/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/02/25/this-years-oscars-snark-meets-sincerity/ |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' television critic [[Hank Stuever]] bemoaned, "There was nothing notably terrible about the show, and nothing particularly enthralling." Regarding MacFarlane's performance as host, Stuever noted, "What you got was a combination of sicko and retro, an Oscar show hosted by someone who waited until Oscar night to discover that he's only so-so at stand-up comedy."<ref>{{cite news|last=Stuever |first=Hank |title=TV review: At the Oscars, the same old song and dance |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/tv-review-at-the-oscars-the-same-old-song-and-dance/2013/02/24/27de5b76-7ed9-11e2-8074-b26a871b165a_story.html |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |work=The Washington Post |date=February 25, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302015647/http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/tv-review-at-the-oscars-the-same-old-song-and-dance/2013/02/24/27de5b76-7ed9-11e2-8074-b26a871b165a_story.html |archivedate=March 2, 2013 }}</ref> Television editor [[Alan Sepinwall]] of [[HitFix]] lamented that the ceremony made for a "frequently messy, but occasionally surprising and/or entertaining evening." He added that MacFarlane "had some funny moments here and there, but he missed way more than he hit, and Frat Boy Seth quickly assumed dominance as the evening went along."<ref>{{cite news|last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |title=Review: Seth MacFarlane emcees a conflicted, bloated, song-heavy Oscar-cast |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-seth-macfarlane-emcees-a-conflicted-bloated-song-heavy-oscar-cast |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |work=[[HitFix]] |date=February 25, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515121648/http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-seth-macfarlane-emcees-a-conflicted-bloated-song-heavy-oscar-cast |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}</ref>

Other media outlets received the broadcast and more positively. Tim Goodman of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised MacFarlane's performance saying that he did "impressively better than one would have wagered." He also noted that he added "plenty of niceties with a little bit of the [[Ricky Gervais]] bite-the-hand-that-feeds-you thing and worked the juxtaposition rather nicely.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman |first=Tim |title=TV Review: Seth MacFarlane Wins at Oscar Hosting Against Odds |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/tv-review-seth-macfarlane-wins-424058 |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=February 24, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306005134/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/tv-review-seth-macfarlane-wins-424058 |archivedate=March 6, 2013 }}</ref> ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' television critic Nina Metz lauded MacFarlane for keeping "a solid handle on the proceedings."
