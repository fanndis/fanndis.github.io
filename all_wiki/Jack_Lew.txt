On November 18, 2010, Lew was confirmed by the Senate by [[unanimous consent]].

The $3.7 trillion 2011 budget President Obama unveiled the administration estimated reductions to federal spending deficits by $1.1 trillion over the next decade if adopted and economic assumptions were fully achieved. Two-thirds of that estimated reduction would come from spending cuts through a 5-year freeze in discretionary spending first announced in Obama's [[2011 State of the Union]] address, as well as savings to mandatory programs such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and lower interest payments on the debt that would result from the lower spending. Tax increases are responsible for the other third of the reduction, including a cap on itemized reductions for wealthier taxpayers and the elimination of tax breaks for oil and gas companies.<ref>{{cite web

In December 2013, Lew said that the government might run out of cash to pay the country's bills by late February or early March 2014. That set up yet another showdown in Congress over raising or suspending the [[debt limit]], a statutory limit on the total amount of United States borrowing, early in the year. "The creditworthiness of the United States is an essential underpinning of our strength as a nation; it is not a bargaining chip to be used for partisan political ends," Mr. Lew said in the letter. "Increasing the debt limit does not authorize new spending commitments. It simply allows the government to pay for expenditures Congress has already approved."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/business/congress-is-warned-anew-on-debt-ceiling.html?ref=politics&_r=0 |author=Annie Lowrey |title=Congress Is Warned Anew Not to Breach Debt Ceiling |newspaper=[[International New York Times]] |date=December 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303234434/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/business/congress-is-warned-anew-on-debt-ceiling.html?ref=politics&_r=0 |archive-date=March 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
