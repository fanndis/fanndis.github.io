'''Carmel Jean Sepuloni''' (born 1977<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/MPs/MPs/4/e/b/49MP169811-Sepuloni-Carmel.htm|title=Current MPs - Carmel Sepuloni|publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]]|accessdate=16 January 2009}}</ref>) is a [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand politician]] and a member of parliament for the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]. She was first elected to [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] following the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]] as a list member, becoming New Zealand's first MP of [[Tongans|Tongan]] descent. In the 2011 general election, Sepuloni won the seat of [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Waitakere]] on the official count with an eleven-vote majority over incumbent National MP [[Paula Bennett]], who subsequently requested a judicial recount, which resulted in Sepuloni losing her seat in Parliament. She returned to Parliament in [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014]] as the member for [[Kelston (New Zealand electorate)|Kelston]].

==Early years==
Sepuloni was born, raised and schooled in Waitara, Taranaki. She moved to Auckland in 1996 to attend the [[Auckland College of Education]] and [[University of Auckland]] where she attained a Diploma Teaching (Primary), and a Bachelor of Education respectively. She also holds a Post Graduate Diploma in Education. Her father was a [[Samoans|Samoan]]-Tongan migrant [[meat processing|freezing worker]] and 'staunch [[Trade union|unionist]]' and her mother was a [[Pākehā]] from a conservative farming family.

===First term, 2008&ndash;2011===
Sepuloni came to parliament in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]] as a [[party list|list MP]] for Labour. She was ranked 35 on the party's list and did not stand in any electorate. The promotion of Sepuloni and others was cited by ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' as an effort by the Labour Party to 'inject new faces' and increase the party's ethnic diversity.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10529963 |title=New generation to fly party flag at election |first1=Audrey |last1=Young |first2=Paula |last2=Oliver |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=1 September 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref>

After the election she became Labour's spokesperson for [[Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (New Zealand)|civil defence]], and associate spokesperson for [[tertiary education]] and social development. She had been involved in the party for only a year and a half before being elected.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-election-2008/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501799&objectid=10541851&pnum=0|title=The back bench baby MPs|first=Alice|last=Neville|date=9 November 2008|accessdate=2 October 2012|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref>

In her [[maiden speech]], Sepuloni said "I've learned through my own experiences and the experiences of others around me, that our young in particular can quickly begin to self-stigmatise when the media and society stigmatise them. When the media only portrays a picture of a ghettoised, poverty-stricken group of trouble makers, then our youth can resign themselves to the fact that this is what they are. They may even take pride in this prescribed image, because it provides them with a level of attention and status which although negative, is attention and status nonetheless."

In June 2010, her Employment Relations (Probationary Period Repeal) Amendment Bill was drawn from the member's ballot. A bill to repeal the changes to probationary employment contained in the [[Employment Relations Amendment Act 2008]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/e/e/2/00DBHOH_BILL10016_1-Employment-Relations-Probationary-Period-Repeal.htm |title=Employment Relations (Probationary Period Repeal) Amendment Bill |publisher=Parliament of New Zealand |accessdate=2010-06-18}}</ref> it was defeated at its first reading 64 votes to 57.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.scoop.co.nz/2010/08/05/member%E2%80%99s-bill-to-remove-90-days-voted-down/ |title=Member's Bill to remove 90 day probationary period voted down |publisher=New Zealand Labour Party |date=2010-08-05 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723132208/http://business.scoop.co.nz/2010/08/05/member%E2%80%99s-bill-to-remove-90-days-voted-down/ |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}</ref>

===Second term, 2011&ndash;2014===
On 19 March 2010, Sepuloni was selected as the Labour candidate for the Waitakere electorate in the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]], facing incumbent National MP and Cabinet minister [[Paula Bennett]]. In April 2011, she was ranked number 24 on the party's list for the election. On the election night preliminary count, she placed second in Waitakere, 349 votes behind Bennett, and with her list ranking was set not to be returned to parliament. When the official results were released on 10 December 2011, Sepuloni had received sufficient [[special vote]]s to win Waitakere and defeat Bennett by 11 votes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/election-2011/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503012&objectid=10772394 |title= Sepuloni wins by 11 votes |work= The New Zealand Herald|first1= Joanne |last1= Carroll |first2= Matthew |last2= Backhouse |date= 11 December 2011 |accessdate= 14 December 2011}}</ref> However, Bennett requested a [[judicial recount]], and on 17 December 2011 subsequently regained her seat with a nine-vote majority, removing Sepuloni from Parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10773368 |title= Paula Bennett reclaims Waitakere |work= The New Zealand Herald|date= 16 December 2011 |accessdate= 17 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/paula-bennett-regains-waitakere-4652966 |title= Paula Bennett regains Waitakere |publisher= Television New Zealand |date= 16 December 2011 |accessdate= 17 December 2011}}</ref> This was not before the Labour Party leadership election on 13 December, in which she participated as a member-elect of the Labour caucus. Not long after leaving Parliament Sepuloni travelled to Egypt to participate as a short term observer on the NDI International Election Mission. Prior to being reelected to parliament, Sepuloni was employed as the Chief Executive for a Pacific disability, mental health and older persons NGO called Vaka Tautua.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
