===Emergence===
As with all ethnic groups, the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Dutch (and their predecessors) has been a lengthy and complex process. Though the majority of the defining characteristics (such as language, religion, architecture or cuisine) of the Dutch ethnic group have accumulated over the ages, it is difficult (if not impossible) to clearly pinpoint the exact emergence of the Dutch people; the interpretation of which is often highly personal. The text below hence focuses on the history of the Dutch ethnic group; for ''Dutch national history'', please see the history-articles of [[History of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. For Dutch colonial history, see the article on the [[Dutch Empire]].

====General====
{{Further|Germanic peoples|Migration Period|Foederati}}
In the first centuries CE, the Germanic tribes formed tribal societies with no apparent form of [[autocracy]] (chiefs only being elected in times of war), beliefs based [[Germanic paganism]] and speaking a dialect still closely resembling [[Proto-Germanic|Common Germanic]]. Following the end of the migration period in the West around 500, with large federations (such as the [[Franks]], [[Vandals]], [[Alamanni]] and [[Saxons]]) settling the decaying [[Roman Empire]], a series of monumental changes took place within these Germanic societies. Among the most important of these are their conversion from [[Germanic paganism]] to [[Christianity]], the emergence of a new political system, centered on kings, and a continuing process of emerging mutual unintelligibility of their various dialects.

====Specific====
{{Further|Franks|Old Frankish|Old Dutch}}
[[File:Clovis crop.jpg|thumb|left|The conversion of the Frankish king [[Clovis I|Clovis]] to Christianity would have great significance in helping shape the identity of the future Dutch people.<ref>'Clovis' conversion to Christianity, regardless of his motives, is a turning point in Dutch history as the elite now changed their beliefs. Their choice would way down its way on the common folk, of whom many (especially in the Frankish heartland of Brabant and Flanders) were less enthusiastic than the ruling class. Taken from ''Geschiedenis van de Nederlandse stam, part I: till 1648''. Page 203, 'A new religion', by [[Pieter Geyl]]. Wereldbibliotheek Amsterdam/Antwerp 1959.</ref>]]
The general situation described above is applicable to most if not all modern European ethnic groups with origins among the [[Germanic tribes]], such as the Frisians, Germans, English and the North-Germanic (Scandinavian) peoples. In the Low Countries, this phase began when the [[Franks]], themselves a union of multiple smaller tribes (many of them, such as the [[Batavians|Batavi]], [[Chauci]], [[Chamavi]] and [[Chattuarii]], were already living in the Low Countries prior to the forming of the Frankish confederation), began to incur the northwestern provinces of the [[Western Roman Empire|Roman Empire]]. Eventually, in 358, the [[Salian Franks]], one of the three main subdivisions among the Frankish alliance<ref>Britannica: "They were divided into three groups: the Salians, the Ripuarians, and the Chatti, or Hessians."([http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/217113/Frank Link])</ref>  settled the area's Southern lands as [[foederati]]; Roman allies in charge of border defense.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''The Franks, who had settled in Toxandria, in Brabant, were given the job of defending the border areas, which they did until the mid-5th century''</ref>

Linguistically [[Old Frankish]] or [[Low Franconian]] gradually evolved into [[Old Dutch]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409930/Dutch-language Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'Dutch language' 10 May. 2009]; "''It derives from Low Franconian, the speech of the Western Franks, which was restructured through contact with speakers of North Sea Germanic along the coast.''"</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/640154/West-Germanic-languages/74783/Characteristics Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'West Germanic languages'. 10 May. 2009];''restructured Frankish—i.e., Dutch;''</ref> which was first attested in the 6th century,<ref>[http://www.onzetaal.nl/kalender/records/r2308.php W. Pijnenburg, A. Quak, T. Schoonheim & D. Wortel, Oudnederlands Woordenboek]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119045215/http://www.onzetaal.nl/kalender/records/r2308.php |date=19 January 2016 }}</ref> whereas religiously the Franks (beginning with the [[upper class]]) converted to [[Christianity]] from around 500 to 700. On a political level, the Frankish warlords abandoned tribalism<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009]; ''The administrative organization of the Low Countries (...) was basically the same as that of the rest of the Frankish empire.''</ref> and founded a number of kingdoms, eventually culminating in the [[Frankish Empire]] of [[Charlemagne]].

However, the population make-up of the Frankish Empire, or even early Frankish kingdoms such as [[Neustria]] and [[Austrasia]], was not dominated by Franks. Though the Frankish leaders controlled most of Western Europe, the Franks themselves were confined to the Northwestern part (i.e. the [[Rhineland]], the Low Countries and Northern [[France]]) of the Empire.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''During the 6th century, Salian Franks had settled in the region between the Loire River in present-day France and the Coal Forest in the south of present-day Belgium. From the late 6th century, Ripuarian Franks pushed from the Rhineland westward to the Schelde. Their immigration strengthened the Germanic faction in that region, which had been almost completely evacuated by the Gallo-Romans.''</ref> Eventually, the Franks in Northern France were assimilated by the general [[Gallo-Roman]] population, and took over their dialects (which became [[French language|French]]), whereas the Franks in the Low Countries retained their language, which would evolve into Dutch. The current Dutch-French language border has (with the exception of the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] in France and [[Brussels]] and the surrounding municipalities in Belgium) remained virtually identical ever since, and could be seen as marking the furthest pale of [[gallicization]] among the Franks.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/209945/Fleming Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'Fleming and Walloon'. 12 May. 2009];''The northern Franks retained their Germanic language (which became modern Dutch), whereas the Franks moving south rapidly adopted the language of the culturally dominant Romanized Gauls, the language that would become French. The language frontier between northern Flemings and southern Walloons has remained virtually unchanged ever since.''</ref>

===Convergence===
{{Further|History of urban centers in the Dutch Low Countries|Burgundian Netherlands|Middle Dutch}}
The medieval cities of the Low Countries, which experienced major growth during the 11th and 12th century, were instrumental in breaking down the already relatively loose local form of feudalism. As they became increasingly powerful, they used their economical strength to influence the politics of their nobility.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online (use fee site); entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''Thus, the town in the Low Countries became a communitas (sometimes called corporatio or universitas)—a community that was legally a corporate body, could enter into alliances and ratify them with its own seal, could sometimes even make commercial or military contracts with other towns, and could negotiate directly with the prince.''</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''The development of a town's autonomy sometimes advanced somewhat spasmodically because of violent conflicts with the prince. The citizens then united, forming conjurationes (sometimes called communes)—fighting groups bound together by an oath—as happened during a Flemish crisis in 1127–28 in Ghent and Brugge and in Utrecht in 1159.''</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''All the towns formed a new, non-feudal element in the existing social structure, and from the beginning merchants played an important role. The merchants often formed guilds, organizations that grew out of merchant groups and banded together for mutual protection while traveling during this violent period, when attacks on merchant caravans were common.''</ref> During the early 14th century, beginning in and inspired by the County of Flanders,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''The achievements of the Flemish partisans inspired their colleagues in Brabant and Liège to revolt and raise similar demands; Flemish military incursions provoked the same reaction in Dordrecht and Utrecht''</ref> the cities in the Low Countries gained huge autonomy and generally dominated or greatly influenced the various political affairs of the fief, including marriage succession.

While the cities were of great political importance, they also formed catalysts for medieval Dutch culture. Trade flourished, population numbers increased dramatically, and (advanced) education was no longer limited to the clergy; Dutch epic literature such as ''[[Elegast]]'' (1150), the ''[[Song of Roland|Roelantslied]]'' and ''[[Reynard the Fox|Van den vos Reynaerde]]'' (1200) were widely enjoyed. The various city guilds as well as the necessity of ''[[Water board (Netherlands)|water boards]]'' (in charge of dikes, canals, etc.) in the Dutch delta and coastal regions resulted in an exceptionally high degree of communal organization. It is also around this time, that ethnonyms such as ''Diets'' and ''Nederlands'' emerge.<ref name="ReferenceA">Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands entry ''"Diets"''. {{in lang|nl}}</ref>

In the second half of the 14th century, the dukes of Burgundy gained a foothold in the Low Countries through the marriage in 1369 of [[Philip the Bold]] of Burgundy to the heiress of the Count of Flanders. This was followed by a series of marriages, wars, and inheritances among the other Dutch fiefs and around 1450 the most important fiefs were under Burgundian rule, while complete control was achieved after the end of the [[Guelders Wars]] in 1543, thereby unifying the fiefs of the Low Countries under one ruler. This process marked a new episode in the development of the Dutch ethnic group, as now political unity started to emerge, consolidating the strengthened cultural and linguistic unity.

===Consolidation===
{{Further|Timeline of Burgundian and Habsburg acquisitions in the Low Countries|Dutch Revolt|Early Netherlandish painting}}
[[File:Plakkaat van Verlatinghe.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Act of Abjuration]], signed on 26 July 1581, was the formal declaration of independence of the Dutch Low Countries.]]
Despite their linguistic and cultural unity, and (in the case of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[County of Holland|Holland]]) economic similarities, there was still little sense of political unity among the Dutch people.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3cxooRES2sC&q=Johan+Huizinga+1960:62&pg=PA183 |title=J. Huizinga (1960: 62) |accessdate=27 August 2010|isbn=9789055892754 |last1=Becker |first1=Uwe |year=2006 }}</ref>

However, the centralist policies of Burgundy in the 14th and 15th centuries, at first violently opposed by the cities of the Low Countries, had a profound impact and changed this. During [[Charles the Bold]]'s many wars, which were a major economic burden for the Burgundian Netherlands, tensions slowly increased. In 1477, the year of Charles' sudden [[Battle of Nancy|death at Nancy]], the Low Countries rebelled against their new liege, [[Mary of Burgundy]], and presented her with a set of demands.

The subsequently issued [[Great Privilege]] met many of these demands, which included that Dutch, not French, should be the administrative language in the Dutch-speaking provinces and that the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] had the right to hold meetings without the monarch's permission or presence. The overall tenure of the document (which was declared void by Mary's son and successor, [[Philip the Handsome|Philip IV]]) aimed for more autonomy for the counties and duchies, but nevertheless all the fiefs presented their demands together, rather than separately. This is evidence that by this time a sense of common interest was emerging among the provinces of the Netherlands. The document itself clearly distinguishes between the Dutch speaking and French speaking parts of the [[Seventeen Provinces]].

Following Mary's marriage to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], the Netherlands were now part of the Habsburg lands. Further centralized policies of the Habsburgs (like their Burgundian predecessors) again met with resistance, but, peaking with the formation of the collateral councils of 1531 and the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], were still implemented. The rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] sought even further centralist reforms, which, accompanied by religious dictates and excessive taxation, resulted in the [[Dutch Revolt]]. The Dutch provinces, though fighting alone now, for the first time in their history found themselves fighting a common enemy. This, together with the growing number of Dutch intelligentsia and the [[Dutch Golden Age]] in which [[Culture of the Netherlands|Dutch culture]], as a whole, gained international prestige, consolidated the Dutch as an ethnic group.

===National identity===
By the middle of the 16th century an overarching, 'national' (rather than 'ethnic') identity seemed in development in the Habsburg Netherlands, when inhabitants began to refer to it as their 'fatherland' and were beginning to be seen as a collective entity abroad; however, the persistence of language barriers, traditional strife between towns, and provincial particularism continued to form an impediment to more thorough unification.<ref>Cf. G. Parker, ''The Dutch Revolt'' (1985), 33–36, and Knippenberg & De Pater, ''De eenwording van Nederland'' (1988), 17 ff.</ref> Following excessive [[taxation]] together with attempts at diminishing the traditional autonomy of the cities and estates in the Low Countries, followed by the religious oppression after being transferred to [[Habsburg Spain]], the Dutch revolted, in what would become the [[Eighty Years' War]]. For the first time in their history, the Dutch established their independence from foreign rule.<ref name="GrNed">Source, the aforementioned 3rd chapter (p3), together with the initial paragraphs of chapter 4, on the establishment of the Dutch Republic.</ref> However, during the war it became apparent that the goal of liberating all the provinces and cities that had signed the [[Union of Utrecht]], which roughly corresponded to the Dutch-speaking part of the Spanish Netherlands, was unreachable. The Northern provinces were free, but during the 1580s the South was recaptured by Spain, and, despite various attempts, the armies of the Republic were unable to expel them. In 1648, the [[Peace of Münster]], ending the [[Eighty Years' War]], acknowledged the independence of the [[Dutch Republic]], but maintained Spanish control of the [[Southern Netherlands]]. Apart from a brief reunification from 1815 until 1830, within the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (which included the [[Francophone]]s/[[Walloons]]) the Dutch have been separated from the Flemings to this day.

===Dutch Empire===
{{Main|Dutch Empire}}
The Dutch colonial empire (Dutch: Het Nederlandse Koloniale Rijk) comprised the overseas territories and trading posts controlled and administered by Dutch chartered companies (mainly the [[Dutch West India Company]] and the [[Dutch East India Company]]) and subsequently by the Dutch Republic (1581–1795), and by the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands after 1815. This and the innovations around it, has left behind a substantial legacy<ref>[[Peter J. Taylor|Taylor, Peter J.]] (2002). ''Dutch Hegemony and Contemporary Globalization'' (Paper prepared for Political Economy of World-Systems Conference, Riverside, California). As [[Peter J. Taylor]] notes, "the Dutch developed a social formula, which we have come to call modern capitalism, that proved to be transferable and ultimately deadly to all other social formulations."</ref> despite the relatively small size of their country. The Dutch people have been [[History of capitalism#The Dutch Republic|pioneers of capitalism]],<ref>Bornschier, Volker; Lengyel, Peter (1992). ''Waves, Formations and Values in the World System'', p. 69. “The rise of [[capitalist]] [[Nation-state|national states]] (as opposed to [[city-states]]) was a European innovation, and the first of these was the Dutch Republic of the seventeenth century."</ref><ref>Lachmann, Richard (2000). ''Capitalists in Spite of Themselves: Elite Conflict and European Transitions in Early Modern Europe'', p. 158</ref> and their more recent emphasis on a modern economy, [[secularism]], and a [[free market]]<ref name="birth of hegemony pp.54-88" />  ultimately had a huge influence on the great powers of the West, especially the [[British Empire]], its [[Thirteen Colonies]], and ultimately the United States.<ref>[[Immanuel Wallerstein|Wallerstein, Immanuel]]: ''The Modern World-System II: Mercantilism and the Consolidation of the European World-Economy, 1600–1750''. (Academic Press, 1980)</ref>

==Ethnic identity==
[[File:Dutch street.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical November scene in the Dutch town [[Middelburg]], [[Netherlands]]]]
The ideologies associated with [[Romantic Nationalism|(Romantic) Nationalism]] of the 19th and 20th centuries never really caught on in the Netherlands, and this, together with being a relatively [[Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic]] society up until the late 1950s, has led to a relatively obscure use of the terms ''nation'' and ''ethnicity'' as both were largely overlapping in practice. Today, despite other ethnicities making up 19.6% of the Netherlands' population, this obscurity continues in colloquial use, in which ''Nederlander'' sometimes refers to the ethnic Dutch, sometimes to anyone possessing [[Dutch nationality law|Dutch citizenship]].<ref>Figures based on a publication by the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] [http://www.rivm.nl/vtv/object_map/o2194n21847.html (link)].</ref> In addition to this, many Dutch people will object to being called ''Hollanders'' as a national denominator on much the same grounds as many [[Welsh people|Welsh]] or [[Scottish people|Scots]] would object to being called ''[[English people|English]]'' instead of [[United Kingdom|British]].

The (re)definition of Dutch cultural identity has become a subject of public debate in recent years following the increasing influence of the [[European Union]] and the influx of non-Western immigrants in the post-[[World War II]] period. In this debate 'typically Dutch traditions' have been put to the foreground.<ref>Shetter (2002), 201</ref>

In sociological studies and governmental reports, ethnicity is often referred to with the terms ''autochtoon'' and ''[[allochtoon]]''.<ref>J. Knipscheer and R. Kleber, ''Psychologie en de multiculturele samenleving'' (Amsterdam 2005), 76 ff.</ref>  These legal concepts refer to place of birth and citizenship rather than cultural background and do not coincide with the more fluid concepts of ethnicity used by cultural anthropologists.

===Greater Netherlands===
As did many European ethnicities during the 19th century,<ref>cf. [[Pan-Germanism]], [[Pan-Slavism]] and many other [[Pan-nationalism|Greater state movements]] of the day.</ref> the Dutch also saw the emerging of various [[Greater Netherlands]]- and [[Pan-nationalism|pan]]-movements seeking to unite the Dutch-speaking peoples across the continent. During the first half of the 20th century, there was a prolific surge in writings concerning the subject. One of its most active proponents was the historian [[Pieter Geyl]], who wrote ''De Geschiedenis van de Nederlandsche stam'' (Dutch: ''The History of the Dutch tribe/people'') as well as numerous essays on the subject.

During World War II, when both Belgium and the Netherlands fell to [[Battle of France|German occupation]], fascist elements (such as the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|NSB]] and [[Verdinaso]]) tried to convince the [[Nazi]]s into combining the Netherlands and [[Flanders]]. The Germans however refused to do so, as this conflicted with their ultimate goal, the  [[New Order (Nazism)|Neuordnung (New Order)]] of creating a single pan-German racial state.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SmQ-gj50D4kC&pg=PA92&dq=%22nederlanders+en+Vlamingen%22 Het nationaal-socialistische beeld van de geschiedenis der Nederlanden] by I. Schöffer. Amsterdam University Press. 2006. Page 92.</ref> During the entire Nazi occupation, the Germans denied any assistance to Greater Dutch [[ethnic nationalism]], and, by decree of [[Hitler]] himself, actively opposed it.<ref>For example he gave explicit orders not to create a voluntary Greater Dutch [[Waffen SS]] division composed of soldiers from the Netherlands and Flanders. ([http://www.gutenberg-e.org/esk01/images/esk02c.html Link to documents])</ref>

The 1970s marked the beginning of formal cultural and linguistic cooperation between Belgium (Flanders) and the Netherlands on an international scale.

==Statistics==
The total number of Dutch can be defined in roughly two ways. By taking the total of all people with full Dutch ancestry, according to the current CBS definition, resulting in an estimated 16,000,000 Dutch people,{{notetag|name=n1}} or by the sum of all people with both full and partial Dutch ancestry, which would result in a number around 25,000,000.

{{Main|Dutch language}}
Dutch is the main language spoken by most Dutch people. It is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] spoken by around 22 million people. Old Frankish, a precursor of the Dutch standard language, was first attested around 500,<ref>"''Maltho thi afrio lito''" is the oldest attested (Old) Dutch sentence, found in the Salic Law, a legal text written around 500. (Source; the [https://books.google.com/books?id=8e1HAAAAMAAJ&q=Maltho+thi+afrio+lito&dq=Maltho+thi+afrio+lito Old Dutch dictionary]) {{in lang|nl}}</ref> in a Frankish legal text, the [[Lex Salica]], and has a written record of more than 1500 years, although the material before around 1200 is fragmentary and discontinuous.

As a West Germanic language, Dutch is related to other languages in that group such as [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. Many West Germanic dialects underwent a series of sound shifts. The [[Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law]] and [[Anglo-Frisian brightening]] resulted in certain early Germanic languages evolving into what are now English and West Frisian, while the [[Second Germanic sound shift]] resulted in what would become (High) German. Dutch underwent none of these sound changes and thus occupies a central position in the [[West Germanic languages]] group.

Standard Dutch has a sound inventory of 13 vowels, 6 [[diphthongs]] and 23 consonants, of which the [[voiceless velar fricative]] (''[[hard and soft G in Dutch|hard ch]]'') is considered a well known sound, perceived as typical for the language. Other relatively well known features of the Dutch language and usage are the frequent use of digraphs like [[Oo (digraph)|Oo]], [[Ee (digraph)|Ee]], [[Letter combination of uu|Uu]] and [[Aa (digraph)|Aa]], the ability to form [[Compound (linguistics)|long compounds]] and the use of slang, including [[profanity]].

The Dutch language has many dialects. These dialects are usually grouped into six main categories; [[Hollandic]], [[West Flemish|West-Flemish]]/[[Zeelandic]], [[East Flemish]], [[Brabantic]], [[Limburgish]] and [[Dutch Low Saxon|Dutch Saxon]].<ref>[http://taalunieversum.org/taal/vragen/antwoord/8/ Taaluniversum website] on the Dutch dialects and main groupings. {{in lang|nl}}</ref> Of these dialects, Hollandic and Dutch Saxon are solely spoken by Northerners. Brabantic, East Flemish, [[West Flemish|West-Flemish]]/[[Zeelandic]] and Limburgish are cross border dialects in this respect. Lastly, the dialectal situation is characterised by the major distinction between [[Hard and soft G in Dutch|'Hard G' and 'Soft G' speaking areas]] (see also [[Dutch phonology]]). Some linguists subdivide these into approximately 28 distinct dialects.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kaart van de Nederlandse dialecten |website=University if Vienna | last=Hüning | first=Matthias |url=https://www.ned.univie.ac.at/publicaties/taalgeschiedenis/nl/dialkarte.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210172052/http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/publicaties/taalgeschiedenis/nl/dialkarte.htm |archive-date=10 December 2006}}</ref>

Dutch immigrants also exported the Dutch language. Dutch was spoken by some settlers in the United States as a native language from the arrival of the first permanent Dutch settlers in 1615, surviving in isolated ethnic pockets until about 1900, when it ceased to be spoken except by first generation Dutch immigrants. The Dutch language nevertheless had a significant impact on the region around [[New York City|New York]]. For example, the first language of [[President of the United States|American president]] [[Martin Van Buren]]<!-- Even though he had a "tussenvoegsel" in his name, he spelled his name with a capital V; the Dutch name style convention does not apply.--> was Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicoline Sijs van der|title=Cookies, Coleslaw, and Stoops: The Influence of Dutch on the North American Languages|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2009|quote=Martin van Buren's mother tongue was Dutch|page=50}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Edward L. Widmer|title=Martin Van Buren|publisher=Times Books|year=2005|quote=Van Buren grew up speaking Dutch, a relic of the time before the Revolution when the inland waterways of North America were a polyglot blend of non-Anglophone communities. His family has resisted intermarriage with Yankees for five generations, and Van Buren trumpeted the fact proudly in his autobiography|pages=6–7|series=The American Presidents Series|author-link=Edward L. Widmer}}</ref> Most of the Dutch immigrants of the 20th century quickly began to speak the language of their new country. For example, of the inhabitants of New Zealand, 0.7% say their home language is Dutch,<ref>2006 New Zealand Census.</ref> despite the percentage of Dutch heritage being considerably higher.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/Dutch/4/en As many as 100,000 New Zealanders are estimated to have Dutch blood in their veins] (some 2% of the current population of New Zealand).</ref>

Dutch is currently an [[official language]] of the Netherlands, Belgium, [[Suriname]], [[Aruba]], [[Sint Maarten]], [[Curaçao]], the [[European Union]] and the [[Union of South American Nations]] (due to Suriname being a member). In [[South Africa]], [[Afrikaans]] is spoken, a daughter language of Dutch, which itself was an official language of South Africa until 1983. The Dutch, Flemish and Surinamese governments coordinate their language activities in the ''Nederlandse Taalunie'' ([[Dutch Language Union]]), an institution also responsible for governing the Dutch Standard language, for example in matters of [[orthography]].

===Etymology of autonym and exonym===
{{main|Theodiscus}}
The origins of the word ''Dutch'' go back to Proto-Germanic, the ancestor of all Germanic languages, ''*theudo'' (meaning "national/popular"); akin to Old Dutch ''dietsc'', [[Old High German]] ''diutsch'', [[Old English]] ''þeodisc'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''þiuda'' all meaning "(of) the common ([[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]) people". As the tribes among the Germanic peoples began to differentiate its meaning began to change. The [[Anglo-Saxons]] of [[England]] for example gradually stopped referring to themselves as ''þeodisc'' and instead started to use ''Englisc'', after their tribe. On the continent ''*theudo'' evolved into two meanings: ''Diets'' (meaning "Dutch (people)" (archaic)<ref>Until World War II, ''Nederlander'' was used synonym with ''Diets''. However the similarity to ''Deutsch'' resulted in its disuse when the [[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|German occupiers]] and Dutch [[fascist]]s extensively used that name to stress the Dutch as an ancient Germanic people. (Source; Etymologisch Woordenboek) {{in lang|nl}}</ref> and ''Deutsch'' ([[German language|German]], meaning "German (people)"). At first the English language used (the contemporary form of) ''Dutch'' to refer to any or all of the Germanic speakers on the European mainland (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians and the Germans). Gradually its [[semantic shift|meaning shifted]] to the Germanic people they had most contact with, both because of their geographical proximity, but also because of the rivalry in trade and overseas territories: the people from the Republic of the Netherlands, the Dutch.

In the [[Dutch language]], the Dutch refer to themselves as ''Nederlanders''. ''Nederlanders'' derives from the Dutch word "''Neder''", a cognate of [[English language|English]] "''Nether''" both meaning "''low''", and "''near the sea''" (same meaning in both English and Dutch), a reference to the geographical texture of the Dutch homeland; the western portion of the [[North European Plain]].<ref>See J. Verdam, ''Middelnederlandsch handwoordenboek'' (The Hague 1932 (reprinted 1994)): "Nederlant, znw. o.

===Names===
{{Main|Dutch name}}
Dutch surnames (and surnames of Dutch origin) are generally easily recognizable.
There are several main types of surnames in Dutch:
*[[Patronymic surname]]s; the name is based on the personal name of the father of the bearer. Historically this has been by far the most dominant form. These type of names fluctuated in form as the surname was not constant. If a man called [[Willem Janszoon|Willem Janssen]] (''William, John's son'') had a son named Jacob, he would be known as [[Jacob Willemszoon de Wet|Jacob Willemsen]] (''Jacob, Williams' son''). Following civil registry, the form at time of registry became permanent. Hence today many Dutch people are named after ancestors living in the early 19th century when civil registry was introduced to the [[Low Countries]]. These names rarely feature ''[[tussenvoegsels]]''.
*[[Toponymic surname]]s; the name is based on the location on which the bearer lives or lived. In Dutch this form of surname nearly always includes one or several ''tussenvoegsels'', mainly ''van'', ''van de'' and variants. Many emigrants removed the spacing, leading to derived names for well known people like [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]].<ref>See the history section of the [[Vanderbilt family]] article, or visit this [http://longislandgenealogy.com/vanderbilt/surnames.htm link]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520223532/http://longislandgenealogy.com/vanderbilt/surnames.htm |date=20 May 2006 }}</ref> While "van" denotes "of", Dutch surnames are sometimes associated with the [[upper class]] of society or aristocracy (cf. [[William the Silent|William of Orange]]). However, in Dutch ''van'' often reflects the original place of origin (Van Der Bilt – He who comes from [[De Bilt]]); rather than denote any aristocratic status.<ref>"It is a common mistake of Americans, or [[English-speaking world|anglophones]] in general, to think that the 'van' in front of a Dutch name signifies nobility." ('''[http://www.last-names.net/Articles/Place.asp Source.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611142832/http://www.last-names.net/Articles/Place.asp |date=11 June 2007 }}'''); "''Von'' may be observed in German names denoting nobility while the ''van'', ''van der'', ''van de'' and ''van den'' (whether written separately or joined, capitalized or not) stamp the bearer as Dutch and merely mean 'at', 'at the', 'of', 'from' and 'from the' ('''[http://www.genealogy.com/18_smith.html Source: Genealogy.com]'''), ([http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nfd/component.php?act=detail&naam=van+de+/+den+/+der Institute for Dutch surnames], in [[Dutch language|Dutch]])</ref>
*[[Occupational surname]]s; the name is based on the occupation of the bearer. Well known examples include Molenaar, Visser and Smit. This practice is similar to English surnames (the example names translate perfectly to [[Miller]], [[Fisher (surname)|Fisher]] and [[Smith (surname)|Smith]]).<ref>Most common names of occupational origin. Source 1947 Dutch census. {{in lang|nl}}</ref>
*[[Cognominal surname]]s; based on nicknames relating to [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]]/other [[physical feature|feature]]s, on the appearance or character of the bearer (at least at the time of registration). For example "De Lange" (the tall one), "De Groot" (the big one), "De Dappere" (the brave one).
*Other surnames may relate to animals. For example; De Leeuw (''The Lion''), Vogels (''Birds''), Koekkoek (''Cuckoo'')  and Devalck (''The Falcon''); to a desired social status; e.g., Prins (''Prince''), De Koninck/Koning (''King''), De Keyzer/keizer (''Emperor''); color; e.g. Rood (''red'') Blauw (''blue'') de Wit (''the white''). There is also a set of made up or descriptive names; e.g. Naaktgeboren (''born naked'').

Dutch names can differ greatly in spelling. The surname ''Baks'', for example is also recorded as ''Backs'', ''Bacxs'', ''Bax'', ''Bakx'',  ''Baxs'', ''Bacx'', ''Backx'', ''Bakxs'' and ''Baxcs''. Though written differently, pronunciation remains identical. Dialectal variety also commonly occurs, with ''De Smet'' and ''De Smit'' both meaning ''Smith'' for example. Surnames of Dutch migrants in foreign environments (mainly the [[English-speaking world]] and [[Francophonie]]) are often adapted, not only in pronunciation but also in spelling.

{{Further|Religion in the Netherlands}}
Prior to the arrival of Christianity, the ancestors of the Dutch adhered to a form of [[Germanic paganism]] augmented with various [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic elements]]. At the start of the 6th century, the first ([[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]]) missionaries arrived. They were later replaced by [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity|Anglo-Saxon missionaries]], who eventually succeeded in converting most of the inhabitants by the 8th century.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01505a.htm The Anglo-Saxon Church] – [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article</ref> Since then, Christianity has been the dominant religion in the region.

In the early 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] began to form and soon spread in the [[Westhoek (region)|Westhoek]] and the County of Flanders, where secret open-air sermons were held, called ''hagenpreken'' ("[[Hedge (barrier)|hedgerow]] [[oration]]s") in Dutch. The ruler of the Dutch regions, [[Philip II of Spain]], felt it was his duty to fight Protestantism and, after the wave of iconoclasm, sent troops to crush the rebellion and make the Low Countries a Catholic region once more.<ref name=autogenerated5>The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477–1806, {{ISBN|0-19-820734-4}}</ref> The Protestants in the southern Low Countries fled North ''[[en masse]]''.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> Most of the Dutch Protestants were now concentrated in the free Dutch provinces north of the river [[Rhine]], while the Catholic Dutch were situated in the Spanish-occupied or -dominated South. After the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, Protestantism did not spread South, resulting in a difference in religious situations.

Contemporary Dutch, according to a 2017 study conducted by Statistics Netherlands, are mostly irreligious with 51% of the population professing no religion. The largest Christian denomination with 24% are the [[Roman catholicism in the Netherlands|Roman Catholics]], followed by 15% [[Protestantism in the Netherlands|Protestants]]. Furthermore, there are 5% Muslims and 6% others (among others buddhists).<ref>[https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2018/43/meer-dan-de-helft-nederlanders-niet-religieus CBS Meer dan de helft Nederlanders niet religieus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706150521/https://www.cbs.nl/nr/rdonlyres/775b8373-86f8-4a17-8872-c4ecfbcb2766/0/2006a3pub.pdf |date=6 July 2017 }}</ref> People of Dutch ancestry in the United States and South Africa are generally more religious than their European counterparts; for example, the numerous Dutch communities of [[western Michigan]] remain strongholds of the [[Reformed Church in America]] and the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]], both descendants of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]].

===Cultural divergences===
One cultural division within Dutch culture is that between the formerly Protestant North and the nowadays Catholic South, which encompasses various cultural differences between the Northern Dutch on one side and the Southern Dutch on the other. This subject has historically received attention from historians, notably [[Pieter Geyl]] (1887–1966) and Carel Gerretson (1884–1958). The historical pluriformity of the Dutch cultural landscape has given rise to several theories aimed at both identifying and explaining cultural divergences between different regions. One theory, proposed by A.J. Wichers in 1965, sees differences in mentality between the southeastern, or 'higher', and northwestern, or 'lower' regions within the Netherlands, and seeks to explain these by referring to the different degrees to which these areas were feudalised during the Middle Ages.<ref>A.M. van der Woude, ''Nederland over de schouder gekeken'' (Utrecht 1986), 11–12. {{in lang|nl}}</ref> Another, more recent cultural divide is that between the ''Randstad'', the urban agglomeration in the West of the country, and the other provinces of the Netherlands.

In Dutch, the cultural division between North and South is also referred to by the [[colloquialism]] "''[[Grote rivieren|below/above the great rivers]]''" as the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Meuse]] roughly form a natural boundary between the Northern Dutch (those Dutch living North of these rivers), and the Southern Dutch (those living South of them). The division is partially caused by (traditional) [[religion|religious]] differences, with the North used to be predominantly Protestant and the South still having a majority of Catholics. Linguistic (dialectal) differences (positioned along the [[Rhine river|Rhine]]/[[Meuse river]]s [sic].) and to a lesser extent, historical [[economic development]] of both regions are also important elements in any dissimilarity.

On a smaller scale cultural pluriformity can also be found; be it in local architecture or (perceived) character. This wide array of regional identities positioned within such a relatively small area, has often been attributed to the fact that many of the current Dutch provinces were de facto independent states for much of their history, as well as the importance of local Dutch dialects (which often largely correspond with the provinces themselves) to the people who speak them.<ref>Dutch Culture in a European Perspective; by D. Fokkema, 2004, Assen.</ref>

====Northern Dutch culture====
[[File:NorthernDutch.png|thumb|Northern Dutch cultural area.<ref name="nl.wikipedia.org">This image is based on the rough definition given by in the 2005 " number 3" edition of the magazine "Neerlandia"  by the [[:nl:Algemeen Nederlands Verbond|ANV]]; it states the dividing line between both areas lies where "the great rivers divide the Brabantic from the Hollandic dialects and where Protestantism traditionally begins".</ref>]]Northern Dutch culture is marked by [[Protestantism]]. Though today many do not adhere to Protestantism anymore, or are only nominally part of a congregation, Protestant-(influenced) values and custom are present. Generally, it can be said the Northern Dutch are more [[pragmatism|pragmatic]], favor a direct approach, and display a less-exuberant lifestyle when compared to Southerners.<ref name=autogenerated2>''Voor wie Nederland en Vlaanderen wil leren kennen''.  1978 By J. Wilmots</ref> On a global scale, the Northern Dutch have formed the dominant vanguard of the Dutch language and culture since the [[Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585)|fall of Antwerp]], exemplified by the use of "Dutch" itself as the [[demonym]] for the country in which they form a majority; the [[Netherlands]]. Linguistically, Northerners speak any of the [[Hollandic]], [[Zeelandic]], and [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects natively, or are influenced by them when they speak the Standard form of Dutch. Economically and culturally, the traditional centre of the region have been the provinces of [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]], or today; the [[Randstad]], although for a brief period during the 13th or 14th century it lay more towards the east, when various eastern towns and cities aligned themselves with the emerging [[Hanseatic League]]. The entire Northern Dutch cultural area is located in the [[Netherlands]], its ethnically Dutch population is estimated to be just under 10,000,000.{{notetag|name=n2}} Northern Dutch culture has been less influenced by French influence than the Southern Dutch culture area.<ref name="Fred M. Shelley 2013, page 97">Fred M. Shelley, Nation Shapes: The Story Behind the World's Borders, 2013, page 97</ref>

=====Frisians=====
{{Main|Frisians|Friesland|West Frisian language}}
Frisians, specifically [[West Frisians]], are an ethnic group present in the north of the Netherlands, mainly concentrated in the province of [[Friesland]]. Culturally, modern Frisians and the (Northern) Dutch are rather similar; the main and generally most important difference being that Frisians speak West Frisian, one of the three sub-branches of the [[Frisian languages]], alongside Dutch, and they find this to be a defining part of their identity as Frisians.<ref name="ynterfryske">{{cite web |title=Ynterfryske ferklearring (Inter-Frisian Declaration) |url=https://fryskerie.frl/ynterfryske-ferklearring/ |website=De Fryske Rie (The Frisian Council) |accessdate=5 January 2020 |language=fy |quote=Wy wolle ús taal, dy't foar ús identiteit beskiedend is, befoarderje en útbouwe. (We want to promote and develop our language, which is defining for our identity)}}</ref>

West Frisians are a part of the [[Interfrisian Council]], established in 1956, which works to promote and develop linguistic and cultural ties across the wider area of [[Frisia]]. The council also calls upon the German and Dutch governments to promote the language and culture in respective regions.<ref name="ynterfryske" />

According to a 1970 inquiry, West Frisians identified themselves more with the Dutch than with [[East Frisians]] or [[North Frisians]].<ref>Frisia. 'Facts and fiction' (1970), by D. Tamminga. {{in lang|nl}}</ref> A study in 1984 found that 39% of the inhabitants of Friesland considered themselves "primarily Frisian," although without precluding also being Dutch. A further 36 per cent claimed they were Dutch, but also Frisian, the remaining 25% saw themselves as only Dutch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mahmood|first1=Cynthia|last2=Armstrong|first2=Sharon L K|date=January 1992|title=Do Ethnic Groups Exist?: A Cognitive Perspective on the Concept of Cultures|journal=Ethnology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=1–14|jstor=3773438|doi=10.2307/3773438}}</ref> Nevertheless Frisians are not disambiguated from the Dutch people in Dutch official [[statistics]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bevolking (Population) |url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37325/table?fromstatweb |website=CBS Statline |publisher=cbs.nl |accessdate=2 January 2020}}</ref>

Many West Frisians maintain cultural ties with the other Frisian groups in nearby areas, and across national borders.<ref name="ynterfryske2">{{cite web|url=https://fryskerie.frl/ynterfryske-ferklearring/|title=Ynterfryske ferklearring (Inter-Frisian Declaration)|website=De Fryske Rie (The Frisian Council)|language=fy|accessdate=5 January 2020|quote=Wy hearre ta mear as ien steat, mar fiele ús dochs, nettsjinsteande alles wat ús skiedt, as hearrend ta ien folk, dat neffens wenst en wollen de eigen taal ûnderhâlde en útbouwe wol.

====Southern Dutch culture====
[[File:SouthernDutch.png|thumb|Southern Dutch cultural area.<ref name="nl.wikipedia.org"/>]]
The Southern Dutch sphere generally consists of the areas in which the population was traditionally Catholic. During the early [[Middle Ages]] up until the [[Dutch Revolt]], the Southern regions were more powerful, as well as more culturally and economically developed.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> At the end of the Dutch Revolt, it became clear the [[Habsburg]]s were unable to reconquer the North, while the North's military was too weak to conquer the South, which, under the influence of the [[Counter-Reformation]], had started to develop a political and cultural identity of its own.<ref>Cf. Geoffrey Parker, ''The Dutch Revolt'': "Gradually a consistent attitude emerged, a sort of 'collective identity' which was distinct and able to resist the inroads, intellectual as well as military, of both the Northern Dutch (especially during the crisis of 1632) and the French. This embryonic 'national identity' was an impressive monument to the government of the archdukes, and it survived almost forty years of grueling warfare (1621–59) and the invasions of Louis XIV until, in 1700, the Spanish Habsburgs died out." (Penguin edition 1985, p. 260). See also J. Israel, ''The Dutch Republic, 1477–1806'', 461–463 (Dutch language version).</ref> The Southern Dutch, including Dutch Brabant and Limburg, remained Catholic or returned to Catholicism. The Dutch dialects spoken by this group are [[Brabantic]], [[South Guelderish]], [[Limburgish]] and [[East Flemish|East]] and [[West Flemish]]. In the Netherlands, an oft-used adage used for indicating this cultural boundary is the phrase ''boven/onder de rivieren'' (Dutch: above/below the rivers), in which 'the rivers' refer to the [[river Rhine]] and [[Meuse river|Meuse]]. Southern Dutch culture has been influenced more by French culture, opposed to the Northern Dutch culture area.<ref name="Fred M. Shelley 2013, page 97"/>

=====Flemings=====
{{Main|Flemish}}
Within the field of [[ethnography]], it is argued that the Dutch-speaking populations of the Netherlands and Belgium have a number of common characteristics, with a mostly shared [[language]], some generally similar or identical [[customs]], and with no clearly separate [[ancestry|ancestral origin]] or [[origin myth]].<ref>National minorities in Europe, W. Braumüller, 2003, page 20.</ref>

However, the popular perception of being a single group varies greatly, depending on subject matter, locality, and personal background. Generally, the Flemish will seldom identify themselves as being Dutch and vice versa, especially on a national level.<ref>Nederlandse en Vlaamse identiteit, Civis Mundi 2006 by S.W Couwenberg. {{ISBN|90-5573-688-0}}. Page 62. Quote: "Er valt heel wat te lachen om de wederwaardigheden van Vlamingen in Nederland en Nederlanders in Vlaanderen. Ze relativeren de verschillen en beklemtonen ze tegelijkertijd. Die verschillen zijn er onmiskenbaar: in taal, klank, kleur, stijl, gedrag, in politiek, maatschappelijke organisatie, maar het zijn stuk voor stuk varianten binnen één taal-en cultuurgemeenschap." The opposite opinion is stated by L. Beheydt (2002): "Al bij al lijkt een grondiger analyse van de taalsituatie en de taalattitude in Nederland en Vlaanderen weinig aanwijzingen te bieden voor een gezamenlijke culturele identiteit. Dat er ook op andere gebieden weinig aanleiding is voor een gezamenlijke culturele identiteit is al door Geert Hofstede geconstateerd in zijn vermaarde boek ''Allemaal andersdenkenden'' (1991)." L. Beheydt, "Delen Vlaanderen en Nederland een culturele identiteit?", in P. Gillaerts, H. van Belle, L. Ravier (eds.),  ''Vlaamse identiteit: mythe én werkelijkheid'' (Leuven 2002), 22–40, esp. 38. {{in lang|nl}}</ref> This is partly caused by the popular stereotypes in the Netherlands as well as Flanders, which are mostly based on the "cultural extremes" of both Northern and Southern culture, including in religious identity. Though these stereotypes tend to ignore the transitional area formed by the Southern provinces of the Netherlands and most Northern reaches of Belgium, resulting in overgeneralizations.<ref>Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: Accounting for the past, 1650–2000; by D. Fokkema, 2004, Assen.</ref> This self-perceived split between Flemings and Dutch, despite the common language, may be compared to how [[Austrians]] do not consider themselves to be [[German people|Germans]], despite the similarities they share with southern Germans such as [[Bavarians]]. In both cases, the Catholic Austrians and Flemish do not see themselves as sharing the fundamentally Protestant-based identities of their northern counterparts.

In the case of Belgium, there is the added influence of [[nationalism]] as the Dutch language and culture [[Taalstrijd|were oppressed]] by the [[French language|francophone]] government. This was followed by a [[Flemish movement|nationalist backlash]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries that saw little help from the Dutch government (which for a long time following the [[Belgian Revolution]] had a reticent and contentious relationship with the newly formed Belgium and a largely indifferent attitude towards its Dutch-speaking inhabitants)<ref>Geschiedenis van de Nederlanden, by J.C.H Blom and E. Lamberts, {{ISBN|978-90-5574-475-6}}; page 383. {{in lang|nl}}</ref> and, hence, focused on pitting "Flemish" culture against French culture, resulting in the forming of the Flemish [[nation]] within Belgium, a consciousness of which can be very marked among some Dutch-speaking Belgians.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNnm-Bog4awC&q=Flemish+monolinguals&pg=PA50 |title=Languages in contact and conflict ... – Google Books |date= 1 January 1995|accessdate=27 August 2010|isbn=9781853592782 |last1=Wright |first1=Sue |last2=Kelly-Holmes |first2=Helen }}</ref>

==Genetics==
[[File:NL PCs abdellaoui.jpg|thumb|The three largerst patterns of genome-wide [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] variation in the Netherlands]]
The largest patterns of [[human genetic variation]] within the Netherlands show strong correlations with geography and distinguish between: (1) North and South; (2) East and West; and (3) the middle-band and the rest of the country. The distribution of gene variants for eye colour, metabolism, brain processes, body height and immune system show differences between these regions that reflect [[Natural selection|evolutionary selection pressures]].<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal|last1=Abdellaoui|first1=Abdel|last2=Hottenga|first2=Jouke-Jan|last3=de Knijff|first3=Peter|last4=Nivard|first4=Michel|last5=Xiangjun|first5=Xiao|last6=Scheet|first6=Paul|last7=Brooks|first7=Andrew|last8=Ehli|first8=Erik|last9=Hu|first9=Yueshan|last10=Davies|first10=Gareth|last11=Hudziak|first11=James|last12=Sullivan|first12=Patrick|last13=van Beijsterveldt|first13=Toos|last14=Willemsen|first14=Gonneke|last15=de Geus|first15=Eco|last16=Penninx|first16=Brenda|last17=Boomsma|first17=Dorret|title=Population structure, migration, and diversifying selection in the Netherlands|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=27 March 2013|volume=21|issue=11|pages=1277–1285|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2013.48|pmid=23531865|pmc=3798851}}</ref>

The largest genetic differences within the Netherlands are observed between the North and the South (with the three [[Grote rivieren|major rivers]] - Rijn, Waal, Maas - as a border), with the [[Randstad]] showing a mixture of these two ancestral backgrounds. The European North-South cline correlates highly with this Dutch North-South cline and shows several other similarities, such as a correlation with height (with the North being taller on average), blue/brown eye colour (with the North having more blue eyes), and genome-wide homozygosity (with the North having lower [[Homozygous|homozygosity]] levels). The correlation with genome-wide homozygosity likely reflects the [[serial founder effect]] that was initiated with the ancient successive out-of-Africa migrations. This does not necessarily mean that these events (north-ward migration and evolutionary selection pressures) took place within the borders of the Netherlands; it could also be that Southern Europeans have migrated more to the South of the Netherlands, and/or Northern Europeans more to the Northern parts.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The North-South differences were likely maintained by the relatively strong [[Pillarisation|segregation]] of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] South and the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] North during the last centuries. During the last 50 years or so there was a large increase of [[Irreligion|non-religious]] individuals in the Netherlands. Their spouses are more likely to come from a different genetic background than those of religious individuals, causing non-religious individuals to show lower levels of genome-wide [[Homozygous|homozygosity]] than Catholics or Protestants.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Abdellaoui|first1=Abdel|last2=Hottenga|first2=Jouke-Jan|last3=Xiangjun|first3=Xiao|last4=Scheet|first4=Paul|last5=Ehli|first5=Erik|last6=Davies|first6=Gareth|last7=Hudziak|first7=James|last8=Smit|first8=Dirk|last9=Bartels|first9=Meike|last10=Willemsen|first10=Gonneke|last11=Brooks|first11=Andrew|last12=Sullivan|first12=Patrick|last13=Smit|first13=Johannes|last14=de Geus|first14=Eco|last15=Penninx|first15=Brenda|last16=Boomsma|first16=Dorret|title=Association Between Autozygosity and Major Depression: Stratification Due to Religious Assortment|journal=Behavior Genetics|date=25 August 2013|volume=43|issue=6|pages=455–467|doi=10.1007/s10519-013-9610-1|pmc=3827717|pmid=23978897}}</ref>

Historically Dutch also lived directly on the eastern side of the German border, most have since been assimilated (apart from ~40,000 recent border migrants), especially since the establishment of Germany itself in 1872. Cultural marks can still be found though. In some villages and towns a [[Dutch Reformed]] church is present, and a number of border districts (such as [[Kleve (district)|Cleves]], [[Borken (district)|Borken]] and [[Viersen (district)|Viersen]]) have towns and village with an etymologically Dutch origin. In the area around [[Cleves]] ([[German language|Ger]].''Kleve'', [[Dutch language|Du.]] ''Kleef'') [[South Guelderish|traditional dialect]] is Dutch, rather than surrounding [[High German|(High/]][[Low German|Low) German]].

During the 1950s, Dutch immigration to South Africa began to increase exponentially for the first time in over a hundred years. The country registered a net gain of around 45,000 Dutch immigrants between 1950 and 2001, making it the sixth most popular destination for citizens of the Netherlands living abroad.<ref name="Nidi.knaw.nl" />

Since the 16th century, there has been a Dutch presence in [[South East Asia]], Taiwan, and [[Japan]]. In many cases, the Dutch were the first Europeans whom the natives encountered. Between 1602 and 1796, the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] sent almost a million Europeans to work in its territories in Asia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/files/22635/11546101681netherlands_voc_archives.doc/netherlands+voc+archives.doc |title=Data |website=portal.unesco.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081217030156/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/files/22635/11546101681netherlands_voc_archives.doc/netherlands+voc+archives.doc |archive-date=17 December 2008 }}</ref> The majority died of disease or made their way back to Europe, but some of them made the Indies their new home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchmalaysia.net/press/Easternization.html |title=Easternization of the West: Children of the VOC |publisher=Dutchmalaysia.net |accessdate=27 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814022910/http://www.dutchmalaysia.net/press/Easternization.html |archive-date=14 August 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Interaction between the Dutch and the native populations mainly took place in [[Dutch period in Ceylon|Sri Lanka]] and the [[Islands of Indonesia|modern Indonesian Islands]]. Most of the time, Dutch soldiers intermarried with local women and settled in the colonies. Through the centuries, there developed a relatively large Dutch-speaking population of mixed Dutch and Indonesian descent, known as [[Indo people|Indos]] or Dutch-Indonesians. The expulsion of Dutchmen following the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian Revolt]] means that currently{{when|date=September 2020}} the majority of this group lives in the Netherlands. Statistics show that Indos are in fact the largest minority group in the Netherlands and number close to half a million (excluding the third generation).<ref>{{in lang|nl}} Willems, Wim, 'De uittocht uit Indie 1945–1995' (Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2001) {{ISBN|90-351-2361-1}}</ref>

===Australia and New Zealand===

Though the Dutch were the first [[Europe]]ans to visit Australia and New Zealand, colonization did not take place and it was only after [[World War II]] that a sharp increase in Dutch emigration to Australia occurred. Poor economic prospects for many Dutchmen as well as increasing demographic pressures, in the post-war Netherlands were a powerful incentive to emigrate. Due to Australia experiencing a shortage of [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[metal industry]] workers it, and to a lesser extent New Zealand, seemed an attractive possibility, with the Dutch government actively promoting emigration.<ref name="nederland-australie2006.nl">[http://www.nederland-australie2006.nl/geschiedenis/au/html/landverhuizers_index.html Nederland-Australie 1606–2006 on Dutch emigration]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628051331/http://www.nederland-australie2006.nl/geschiedenis/au/html/landverhuizers_index.html |date=28 June 2010 }}</ref>

The effects of Dutch migration to Australia can still be felt. There are many Dutch associations and a Dutch-language newspaper continues to be published. The Dutch have remained a tightly knit community, especially in the large cities. In total, about 310,000 people of Dutch ancestry live in Australia whereas New Zealand has some 100,000 Dutch descendants.<ref name="nederland-australie2006.nl"/>

===North America===

The Dutch had settled in America long before the establishment of the United States of America.<ref>The U.S. declared its independence in 1776; the first Dutch settlement was built in 1614: Fort Nassau, where presently Albany, New York is positioned.</ref> For a long time the Dutch lived in Dutch colonies, owned and regulated by the Dutch Republic, which later became part of the [[Thirteen Colonies]].

Nevertheless, many Dutch communities remained virtually isolated towards the rest of America up until the [[American Civil War]], in which the Dutch fought for the North and adopted many American ways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C005615/data/english_text/vanraalte8.html |title=How the Dutch became Americans, American Civil War.

Most future waves of Dutch immigrants were quickly assimilated. There have been five American presidents of Dutch descent: [[Martin Van Buren]] (8th, first president who was not of British descent, first language was Dutch), [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (32nd, elected to four terms in office, he served from 1933 to 1945, the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms), [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (26th), as well as [[George H. W. Bush]] (41st) and [[George W. Bush]] (43rd), the latter two descendant from the [[Schuyler family]].

The first Dutch people to come to Canada were [[Dutch Americans]] among the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s. The largest wave was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when large numbers of Dutch helped settle the Canadian west. During this period significant numbers also settled in major cities like [[Toronto]].

While interrupted by World War I, this migration returned in the 1920s, but again halted during the [[Great Depression]] and World War II. After the war a large number of Dutch immigrants moved to Canada, including a number of [[war bride]]s of the Canadian soldiers who liberated the Low Countries.

==Notes==
{{notefoot|refs=
{{notetag|name=n1|In the 1950s (the peak of traditional emigration) about 350,000 people left the Netherlands, mainly to [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]]. About one-fifth returned. The maximum Dutch-born emigrant stock for the 1950s is about 300,000 (some have died since). The maximum emigrant stock (Dutch-born) for the period after 1960 is 1.6 million. Discounting pre-1950 emigrants (who would be about 85 or older), at most around 2 million people born in the Netherlands are now living outside the country. Combined with the 13.1 million ethnically Dutch inhabitants of the Netherlands, there are about 16 million people who are Dutch (of Dutch ancestry), in a minimally accepted sense.
