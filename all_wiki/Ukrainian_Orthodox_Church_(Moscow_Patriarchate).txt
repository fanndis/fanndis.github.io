==History==
{{See also|History of Christianity in Ukraine}}

===Under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople===
====Moscow, Lithuania, Galich metropolia====
The Ukrainian Orthodox Church considers itself the sole descendant in modern Ukraine of the [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'|metropolis of Kyiv and all Rus']] within the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|established]] in Kyiv in the 10th century. Due to [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|invasion of the Mongols]] in the 13th century the metropolitan seat was moved to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] and later to [[Moscow]], while in the Duchy of Halych and Volhynia was created a separate Metropolis of Halych with own Metropolitan. In the 14th century, the Grand Duke of Lithuania [[Algirdas]] who established his control over the former territories of [[Kyivan Rus]] attempted to move the metropolitan seat back to Kyiv.

====Revival====
In 1596, the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galich and all Rus' [[Michael Rohoza]] accepted the [[Union of Brest]] transforming dioceses of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople into the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] under the [[Holy See]]'s jurisdiction. In 1620, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople [[Cyril Lucaris]] reestablished Orthodox dioceses for the Orthodox population of what was then the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] — under the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galicia, and all Russia [[Job Boretsky]] as the Patriarchal [[Exarch]].

===Merger into the Moscow Patriarchate===
Following the [[Pereyaslav Council|transfer]] of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] under the sovereignty of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1654, the Kyivan metropolis in 1686<ref>[http://www.interfax-religion.ru/?act=news&div=70152 Переход Киевской митрополии к РПЦ в XVII веке был абсолютно законным, попытки оспорить это нельзя воспринимать всерьез - богослов] [[Interfax]], 5 July 2018.</ref><ref>Khomenko, S., Denysov, M.

BBC Ukraine. 2 November 2018</ref> was transferred by the Patriarch [[Dionysius IV of Constantinople|Dionysius IV]] under the jurisdiction of the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Moscow Patriarchate]], following the election of [[Gedeon (Svyatopolk-Chetvertynsky)|Gedeon Svyatopolk-Chetvertynsky]] as the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galicia, and all Russia with the help of the [[Hetman of Zaporizhian Host]] [[Ivan Samoylovych]]. In late 2018, the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] indicated that information about that it transferred jurisdiction over Ukraine to Moscow Patriarchate is inaccurate as Constantinople temporarily provided Moscow with stewardship over the Ukrainian church.<ref>[https://echo.msk.ru/news/2286162-echo.html Constantinople Constantinople justified its decision to provide Ukraine with autocephaly]. Ekho Moskvy. 28 September 2018</ref> The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] retorted immediately by stating that the Constantinople's statement is false and further discussion and revision of historical archives needs to be conducted.<ref>[https://ria.ru/20180927/1529516009.html In ROC commented report of Constantinople on history of church in Ukraine (В РПЦ прокомментировали отчет Константинополя по истории церкви на Украине)]. [[RIA Novosti]]. 27 September 2018</ref>

Soon, Gedeon gradually lost control of the dioceses which had been under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Kyiv. In January 1688, Gedeon's title was changed by Moscow to the ″Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galich, and Little Russia″. Gedeon's successors were effectively mere diocesan bishops under the Moscow Patriarchate and later [[Russian Empire|Russia]]'s [[Most Holy Synod]].

Before the [[Battle of Poltava (1708)|Battle of Poltava]], when [[Ivan Mazepa]] sided with [[Carl XII]], the new Metropolitan Ioasaf along with bishops of Chernigov and Pereyaslav was summoned by [[Peter the Great]] to [[Hlukhiv|Glukhov]] where they were ordered to declare an [[anathema]] onto Mazepa. After the battle of Poltava, in 1709 Metropolitan Ioasaf was exiled to [[Tver]] and in 1710 a church censorship was introduced to the Kyiv metropolia. In 1718 Metropolitan Ioasaf was arrested and dispatched to [[Saint Petersburg]] for interrogation where he died.

From 1718 to 1722, the Metropolitan See in Kyiv was vacant and ruled by the Kyiv Spiritual Consistory (under the authority of the [[Most Holy Synod]]); in 1722 it was occupied by Archbishop Varlaam.

===Synodal period===
In 1730, Archbishop Varlaam with all members of the Kyiv Spiritual Consistory were put on trial by the Privy Chancellery. After being convicted, Varlaam as a simple monk was exiled to the [[Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery]] in Vologda region where he served a sentence of imprisonment of 10 years. After the death of the Russian Empress [[Anna of Russia|Anna]] in 1740, Varlaam was allowed to return and recovered all his [[Archiereus]] titles. He however refused to accept back those titles and, after asked to be left in peace, moved to the [[Tikhvin Assumption Monastery]]. In 1750 Varlaam accepted the [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism#Great Schema|Great Schema]] under the name of Vasili and soon died in 1751.

In 1743, the title of Metropolitan was re-instated for Archbishop [[Raphael Zaborovsky]].

On 2 April 1767, the Empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great]] issued an edict stripping the title of the Kyivan Metropolitan of the style "and all Little Russia".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150416145158/http://www.pravenc.ru/text/76238.html Arseniy] at the Orthodox Encyclopedia</ref>

===Fall of monarchy in Russia and Exarchate===
{{see also|Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church}}
[[File:Highest authority of Russian Orthodox Church in 1917.jpg|thumb|300px|Participants of the 1917 Local Council. Metropolitan Antony Khrapovitsky is to the right of Patriarch Tikhon]]
Metropolitan [[Vladimir Bogoyavlensky]] chaired the All-Ukrainian Church Council that took a break between its sessions on 18 January 1918 and was to be resumed in May 1918. On 23–24 January 1918, the Red Guards of [[Reingold Berzin]] occupied Kyiv (see [[Ukrainian–Soviet War]]). In the evening of 25 January 1918, Metropolitan Vladimir was found dead between walls of the Old Pechersk Fortress beyond the Gates of All Saints, having been killed by unknown people.

In May 1918, the Metropolitan of Kyiv and Galich [[Antony (Khrapovitsky)|Antony Khrapovitsky]] was appointed to the [[Eparchy of Kyiv (Moscow Patriarchate)|Kyiv eparchy]], a former candidate to become the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] at the [[1917–18 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Local Council]] of 1917 and losing it to the [[Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow|Patriarch Tikhon]]. In July 1918 Metropolitan Antony became the head of the All-Ukrainian Church Council. Eventually he sided with the Russian [[White movement]] supporting the Denikin's forces of [[South Russia (1919–1920)|South Russia]], while keeping the title of Metropolitan of Kyiv and Halych. After the defeat of the Whites and the exile of Antony, in 1919-21 the metropolitan seat was temporarily held by the bishop of Cherkasy Nazariy (also the native of [[Kazan]]). After the arrest of Nazariy by the Soviet authorities in 1921, the seat was provisionally held by the bishop of Grodno and newly elected Exarch of Ukraine Mikhail, a member of the Russian [[Black Hundreds]] nationalistic movement. After his arrest in 1923, the Kyiv eparchy was provisionally headed by various bishops of neighboring eparchies until 1927. After his return in 1927 Mikhail became the Metropolitan of Kyiv and Exarch of Ukraine until his death in 1929.

In 1945, after the integration of [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] into the [[USSR]], eastern parts of the [[Eparchy of Mukačevo and Prešov]] were transferred from the supreme jurisdiction of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] to the jurisdiction of the Exarchate of Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, and a new Eparchy of Mukachevo and Uzhgorod was formed.

===Dissolution of the Soviet Union and self rule===
On 28 October 1990,<ref>[http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/1302845.html К 20-летию Благословенной Грамоты Святейшего Патриарха Московского и всея Руси Алексия II о даровании Украинской Православной Церкви самостоятельности в управлении]: ″Определение фактически вступило в силу уже 28 октября 1990 года (когда Святейший Патриарх Алексий вручил занимавшему тогда Киевскую кафедру митрополиту Филарету соответствующую Грамоту)″</ref> it was granted a status of a self–governing church under the jurisdiction of the ROC (but ''not'' the full [[Autonomy#Religion|autonomy]] as is understood in the ROC legal terminology).

Metropolitan [[Volodymyr Sabodan|Vladimir (Sabodan)]], who succeeded [[Filaret (Denysenko)]], was enthroned in 1992 as the Primate of the UOC under the title [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Kiev|Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Ukraine]], with the official residency in the [[Kyiv Pechersk Lavra]], which also houses all of the Church's administration.

The UOC-MP, prior to 2019, was believed to be the largest religious body in Ukraine with the greatest number of parish churches and communities counting up to half of the total in Ukraine and totaling over 10,000.

Additionally, the geographical factor plays a major role in the number of adherents, as the Ukrainian population tends to be more churchgoing in the western part of the country rather than in the UOC-MP's heartland in southern and eastern Ukraine. Politically, many in Ukraine see the UOC-MP as merely a puppet of the ROC and consequently a geopolitical tool of [[Russia]], which have stridently opposed the consolidation and recognition of the independent OCU.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurozine.com/the-changing-dilemmas-of-ukrainian-orthodoxy/|title=The changing dilemmas of Ukrainian Orthodoxy|last=Younger|first=Katherine|date=8 November 2019|website=www.eurozine.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2019-12-27}}</ref>

In December 2017, the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] published classified documents revealing that the [[People's Commissariat for State Security|NKGB]] of the USSR and its units in the Union and autonomous republics, territories and regions were engaged in the selection of candidates for participation in the 1945 council that elected [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow]] from the representatives of the clergy and the laity. This included "persons who have religious authority among the clergy and believers, and at the same time checked for civic or patriotic work". A letter sent in September 1944 and signed by the head of the 2nd Directorate of the NKGB of the USSR Fedotov and the head of the Fifth Division 2nd Directorate of Karpov stated that "it is important to ensure that the number of nominated candidates is dominated by the agents of the NKGB, capable of holding the line that we need at the Council."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://espreso.tv/news/2017/12/10/moskovskyy_patriarkhat_stvoryuvaly_agenty_nkvs_svidchat_rozskerecheni_sbu_dokumenty|title=Московський патріархат створювали агенти НКВС, - свідчать розсекречені СБУ документи|website=espreso.tv}}</ref><ref>[https://www.znak.com/2017-12-10/sbu_rassekretila_arhivy_moskovskogo_patriarha_v_1945_godu_izbirali_agenty_nkgb СБУ рассекретила архивы: московского патриарха в 1945 году избирали агенты НКГБ]</ref>
