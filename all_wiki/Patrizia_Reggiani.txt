'''Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli''' (born December 2, 1948) is the ex-wife of [[Maurizio Gucci]]. During the 1980s while she was married to Maurizio Gucci, she was a wealthy Italian socialite and high fashion personality. In late 1998 she went through a scandalous trial followed closely by the Italian public for ordering her husband's murder.

== Relationship with Maurizio Gucci ==
In 1973 she married Maurizio Gucci, with whom she had two daughters, Allegra and Alessandra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robadadonne.likers.it/9614/omicidio-gucci-patrizia-reggiani-rinuncia-alla-semiliberta-non-ho-mai-lavorato-in-vita-mia/|title=Omicidio Gucci – Patrizia Reggiani, rinuncia alla semilibertà: "Non ho mai lavorato in vita mia"}}</ref> On May 2, 1985, after 12 years of marriage, Maurizio left Patrizia for a younger woman, telling her he was going on a short business trip. He never returned home. In 1991, Patrizia and Maurizio Gucci officially divorced. As part of the settlement, Patrizia Reggiani collected the equivalent of $500,000 annual [[alimony]]. In 1992 she was diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]], which was removed without any negative consequences. On March 27, 1995, her husband was shot and killed by a [[hitman]] hired by Patrizia on the steps outside his office as he arrived to work.<ref>{{cite book| title = Family Business on the Couch: A Psychological Perspective| url = https://archive.org/details/familybusinesson00vrie| url-access = limited| publisher = John Wiley and Sons|year=2007| isbn = 978-0-470-51671-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/familybusinesson00vrie/page/n129 102]}}</ref><ref>Sara Gay Forden, ''The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed'', [[HarperCollins]] {{ISBN|0-688-16313-0}}, 2001.</ref>

On January 31, 1997 Patrizia Reggiani was arrested, and in 1998 she was convicted of arranging the killing of her husband, Maurizio Gucci, and sentenced to 29 years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/world/former-wife-given-29-years-for-ordering-gucci-slaying.html|title=Former Wife Given 29 Years for Ordering Gucci Slaying|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1998-11-04|last1=Stanley|first1=Alessandra}}.</ref> The trial garnered intense media interest and is where Reggiani became known as the "Black Widow".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turtlemeat.com/invest/the-maurizio-gucci-story/23/|title=Investing Money » The Maurizio Gucci Story|website=turtlemeat.com}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/20/world/milan-journal-the-black-widow-goes-on-trial-in-gucci-slaying.html The Black Widow goes on trial] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 20 May 1998</ref> Her daughters asked that her conviction be overturned, claiming her [[brain tumor]] had affected her personality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/international/gucci_black_widow_wins_retrial_over_hitman_murder_of_husband_1_538554|title=Gucci 'black widow' wins retrial over hitman murder of husband}}</ref> In 2000, an appeals court in Milan upheld the conviction but reduced the sentence to 26 years. That same year, Reggiani tried to commit suicide by hanging herself with a shoelace, but was rescued.

In October 2011, she was offered the possibility of [[open prison]], but refused saying "I've never worked in my life and I'm certainly not going to start now".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://irenebrination.typepad.com/irenebrination_notes_on_a/2013/09/patrizia-reggiani-bozart.html|title=Wealthy Gucci Murderess Prefers Prison to Work}}</ref> She was released in October 2016 after serving 18 years.<ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/10/italys-black-widow-entitled-nearly-1-million-year-despite-ordering/|title=Italy's 'Black Widow' Gucci heiress who ordered ex-husband's murder entitled to nearly £1 million a year from his estate|first=Nick|last=Squires|date=10 February 2017|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref> The sentence was cut short due to time off for good behaviour.<ref name="auto"/> In 2017, she was awarded an annuity of £900,000 from Gucci's estate.<ref name="auto"/> This was due to an agreement signed in 1993.<ref name="auto"/> The court also ruled on a back-payment during her time in prison, amounting to over £16m.<ref name="auto"/> The ordering was made against her ex-husband's estate, currently being administered by her two daughters, who were expected to appeal.<ref name="auto"/>
