==Biography==
Born in [[Bacolod]], [[Negros Occidental]], [[Philippines]], Porteous is the daughter of Nicolas Lacson and Amparo Lacson. Her grandfather, General [[Aniceto Lacson]], was a prominent military figure in Negros Occidental during the [[Philippine Revolution]] while her uncle, [[Arsenio Lacson]], was the first elected mayor of [[Manila]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Wainwright, Robert |title=Rose: The Unauthorised Biography of Rose Hancock Porteous |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=2003 |isbn=1-86508-934-6 |location=Sydney |page=24}}</ref>

After spending time in Hong Kong, Spain, Singapore and Malaysia,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/13/1039656215196.html |title=Book review: A fascination of riches |author=Costello, Chris |date=14 December 2002 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref> Porteous arrived in Australia in 1983 on a three-month [[Visa (document)|working visa]]. Porteous began working as a [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|maid]] for the newly widowed Hancock.<ref name="Age-timeline"/>

===Marriage to Hancock===
[[File:Prix d'Amour.jpg|thumb|right|Prix d'Amour, during its demolition in early 2006.]]
Hancock and Porteous became involved over the course of Porteous' employment and they were wed on 6 July 1985,<ref name=Age-timeline/> in [[Sydney]]. Porteous, who was thirty-nine years younger than her husband, was often accused of gold digging because of their [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|age disparity]]. As Porteous later stated: "I have been accused of sleeping with every man in Australia ... I would have been a very busy woman."<ref name="age-quotes">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/04/26/1019441296445.html |title=Quotes from the inquest |agency=AAP |work=[[The Age]] |location=Australia |date=26 April 2002 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> Gina Rinehart, who stood to inherit his entire estate, did not attend the wedding.

Although the marriage would later prove tumultuous, early on Hancock was clearly infatuated with his young wife. He gave her money and investments in [[real estate]] in the Sydney area.  Porteous, in turn, helped Hancock to look and act like a much younger man, belying his eight decades.  As ''[[The Age]]'' put it, "Rose made Lang feel younger, sprucing up his wardrobe, dying his hair and getting rid of his cane".<ref name="age-marriedboss">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/04/26/1019441295711.html |title=The maid who married the boss |agency=AAP |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=26 April 2002 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> Together they built the "Prix d'Amour", a lavish 16-block mansion overlooking the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]].  The mansion, which was modelled after [[Tara (plantation)|Tara]], the plantation mansion in the movie ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', was the setting for many large parties at which Hancock and Porteous would "dance into the night".<ref name="age-marriedboss"/>

As the marriage wore on, however, the relationship between Hancock and Porteous began to break down. Rumours surfaced of her having disputes with servants and others close to Hancock, especially Rinehart, and as Hancock's health worsened, so did his relationship with Porteous.  Rinehart would later claim that Hancock's bride had paid little attention to his worsening health, but had instead "screeched at him for money".<ref name="age-marriedboss"/>  Although there were many quarrels, Hancock and Porteous remained married until his death in 1992.<ref name=Age-timeline/>

===Legal action relating to the death of Hancock===
Porteous rose to prominence in the 1990s as the central figure in a series of [[lawsuit]]s launched by her step-daughter, Gina Rinehart. Rinehart is the daughter of Lang Hancock and Hope Margaret Nicholas, Hancock's second wife. On 25 June 1992, less than three months after Hancock's death, Porteous married for the fourth time, to Hancock's long-time friend [[William Porteous]].<ref name=Age-timeline/> Rinehart was indignant at the haste with which her stepmother had remarried.

Central to Rinehart's lawsuits were the accusations that Porteous married Hancock only for his fortune and alleged that her stepmother's actions had contributed to her father's death. According to his daughter, the death was "unexpected" and came "despite strong will to live".<ref name="chronology">{{cite web|url=http://www.hancockprospecting.com.au/lgh%20achievements.pdf |format=PDF |title=Lang Hancock Chronology: 50 Years Commemoration |publisher=Hancock Prospecting |accessdate=5 September 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616170435/http://hancockprospecting.com.au/lgh%20achievements.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2005 }}</ref> An autopsy showed that he had died of [[arteriosclerosis|arteriosclerotic]] [[cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] and police investigation revealed no evidence to contradict that.<ref name="Age-timeline" /> However, Hancock's daughter insisted that her stepmother had unnaturally hastened his death. Two successive state coroners refused to allow an inquest, but one was eventually granted in 1999 under the direction of [[Attorney-General of Western Australia|WA Attorney-General]], Peter Foss.<ref name="Age-timeline" />

After preliminary hearings during 2000, the inquest began in April 2001 with an initial estimate of 63 witnesses to be called over five weeks.<ref name=Age-timeline/> The inquest was dominated by claims that Porteous had literally nagged Hancock to death with shrill tantrums and arguments. Porteous denied the allegations, famously explaining: "For anyone else it would be a tantrum, for me it's just raising my voice."<ref name="age-quotes"/> In the last few days of Hancock's life, Porteous had attempted to pressure him into changing his [[will (legal)|will]] and Hancock eventually took out a restraining order against her.<ref>{{cite news |title=Test of Wills |author=McGeough, Paul |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=28 October 1995 |accessdate= }}</ref> The inquest was put on hold after allegations that Rinehart had paid witnesses to appear and that some had lied in their testimony.<ref name="abc-finalchapter">{{cite news |title=Lang Hancock â€“ final chapter |author=Weber, David |work=ABC News |location=Australia |date=22 May 2003 |accessdate= }}</ref> It resumed three months later with a smaller witness list and ended with the finding that Hancock had died of natural causes and not as a result of Porteous' behaviour.<ref name=Age-timeline/>

With a legal bill of A$2.7m,<ref name="Wainwright, Robert"/> Rose and William Porteous commenced action against Rinehart, that was eventually settled out of court in 2003.<ref name="Grimm, Nick"/> A few months later, Porteous was revealed as one of several Australian celebrities promoting the [[SPC Ardmona]] brand of canned chopped tomatoes with the slogan, ''Rich and Thick''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bandt.com.au/content/articles/thick-rich-rose-reveals-sense-of-humour.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120719031149/http://www.bandt.com.au/content/articles/thick-rich-rose-reveals-sense-of-humour.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 July 2012 |title=Thick, rich Rose reveals sense of humour |date=12 August 2002 |work=B&T |location=Australia |accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref> A short-lived one-off reality TV show titled ''Rose'' followed in November 2002.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ligerakis, Maria |url=http://www.bandt.com.au/content/articles/rich-rose-loyal-to-her-thick-tomato-brand.aspx |title=Rich Rose loyal to her thick tomato brand |date=8 November 2002 |work=B&T |location=Australia |accessdate=11 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121230124156/http://www.bandt.com.au/content/articles/rich-rose-loyal-to-her-thick-tomato-brand.aspx |archivedate=30 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During 2005 it was reported that Porteous was being sued in excess of [[Australian dollar|A$]]14 million by Melbourne-based law firm [[Slater & Gordon]] in unpaid legal fees. It was reported that the unpaid fees came from court cases and legal actions in which Slater and Gordon represented Porteous, including the 2001 inquiry into the death of Hancock, and the long-running court battle with Rinehart, over his A$400 million-plus estate. It was reported that Porteous defaulted on two monthly payments to the legal firm of A$25,000 each.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/lawyers-sue-socialite-for-14m-in-fees/2005/06/27/1119724578907.html |title=Lawyers sue socialite for $14m in fees |author=Hughes, Gary |date=28 June 2005 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref> The dispute was lodged in the [[Victorian Supreme Court]] and Porteous unsuccessfully sought to have the matter heard in Western Australia, also claiming that she signed legal agreements in 2005, under [[duress]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/porteous-loses-bid-to-transfer-case/2005/10/03/1128191647695.html |title=Porteous loses bid to transfer case |author=Gregory, Peter |date=3 October 2005 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref> The matter was settled in November, with Porteous agreeing to pay the law firm A$13.25 million by 31 December 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/porteous-agrees-to-pay-13m-legal-bill/2005/11/25/1132703376871.html |title=Porteous agrees to pay $13m legal bill |author=Gregory, Peter |date=26 November 2005 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref>

===Wealth===
The wealth of Porteous is unknown. In 2007 it was reported that she sold two adjoining penthouses in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], Melbourne over six months for an estimated A$9 million, a profit of A$4 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.realestatesource.com.au/rose-porteous-sells-luxury-toorak-penthouse.html |title=Rose Porteous sells luxury Toorak penthouse |author=Pallisco, Marc |date=29 July 2007 |work=Real Estate Source |accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref> In March 2006, Porteous commissioned the demolition of her Perth mansion "Prix d'Amour", built with Hancock in 1990 for an estimated cost of A$7 million. The 17-room landmark mansion featured French doors and windows, parquetry and marble floors and wrought iron. The estate, set on 8,100 square metres featured the main house, two guest houses, a tennis court and two swimming pools. The property was then subdivided into ten approximately 800 m<sup>2</sup> lots (each with maximised views) which were put on the market for around A$5 million. In 2008â€“2009, two of these blocks were resold for a profit of A$1.5 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Roses-love-shack-gets-the-axe/2005/02/25/1109180088032.html |title=Rose's love shack gets the axe |agency=AAP |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=25 February 2005 |accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/how-to-downsize-your-home-in-the-style-of-rose-porteous/2006/03/25/1143084045400.html |title=How to downsize your home in the style of Rose Porteous |author=Kappelle, Liza |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/6230401/new-mansions-on-the-block/ |work=The West Australian |title=New mansions on The Block |author=Campbell, Kate |date=17 October 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref>

===Current===
Celebrating her 60th birthday in 2008, Porteous was planning a low-key affair for 60 guests at her [[Claremont, Western Australia|Claremont]] house. Claiming that Porteous now lives a reclusive existence, in 2008 it was reported that musician Paul Dion has written a [[musical theatre|musical]] based on the life of Porteous, and he was seeking financial backers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.watoday.com.au/lifestyle/our-rose-celebrates-60-years-20081016-5270.html |title=Our Rose celebrates 60 years |author=Pepper, Dailie |date=17 October 2008 |work=WA Today |accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref>
