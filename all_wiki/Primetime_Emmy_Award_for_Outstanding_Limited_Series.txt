The '''[[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Limited Series''' represents excellence in the category of limited series that are two or more episodes, with a total running time of at least 150 minutes. 

==Criteria==
The program must tell a complete, non-recurring story, and not have an ongoing storyline or main characters in subsequent seasons.<ref name=2015rules>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/default/files/Downloads/2016-rules-procedures-v7.pdf |title=2015 – 2016 Rules and Procedures |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] |accessdate=July 28, 2016}}</ref>

==Background==
The category began as the '''Outstanding Drama/Comedy – Limited Episodes''' in 1973.<ref name=lat-1972may19>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/157011854.html |title=Changes Announced in Emmy Categories |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 19, 1972 |page=G24 |last=Page |first=Don |url-access=subscription |quote=The major category change was the "acknowledgement" of the limited or short series, which will hereafter be judged separately from the continuing series... The limited series, being separated from the continuing series, means that such shows as "Henry VIII" and "Elizabeth R" could not have been named best dramatic series at last Sunday's Emmy awards, nor would Glenda Jackson have won her Emmy for best actress in a series. Nor would Keith Michell have received his Emmy for best actor in a leading role for a segment of "Henry VIII". The academy denied the rules change was made because of any embarrassment over the British sweep.}} [http://search.proquest.com/docview/157011854/ Link] via [[ProQuest]].</ref><ref name=bc-2013jul29>{{cite news |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/file/10471-0729_FF_RWD.pdf |title=Emmy's Longtime Mini Firestorm |magazine=[[Broadcasting & Cable]] |first=Andrea |last=Morabito |date=July 29, 2013 |page=58}}</ref> Prior to that year, limited series and miniseries were entered in the same category as continuing series for '''Outstanding Series – Drama'''. According to a 1972 newspaper article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',<ref name=lat-1972may19 /> this change might be due to the then recent entry of a number of British produced limited series that were competing with American produced continuing series in the same pre-existing category. The category was renamed '''Outstanding Limited Series''' in 1974, and later '''Outstanding Miniseries''' in 1986.<ref name=bc-2013jul29 />

In 1991, the '''Outstanding Miniseries''' category was merged with '''[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie|Outstanding TV Movie]]''', then called '''Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special''', to form '''Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special and Miniseries''', and the number of nominees increased from five to six.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1991 |title=43rd Primetime Emmys Nominees and Winners |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] |accessdate=December 1, 2014}}</ref> For that year, two miniseries had competed with four "made-for-television movies". The decision was reversed in 1992. In 2011, due to a low number of eligible miniseries in recent years, the categories were again merged as [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries or Movie]], before reverting in 2014, following an influx in limited series following the critically and commercial popularity of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] [[anthology]] series ''[[American Horror Story]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |title=EMMYS: TV Academy Splits Best Miniseries & TV Movie, Reality Program & Voice-Over Categories, Expands Combined Longform Fields To 6 Nominees, Sets Possibility For 7 Best Drama & Comedy Series Nominees |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/02/its-official-tv-academy-splits-best-miniseries-tv-movie-category/ |accessdate=February 21, 2014 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=February 20, 2014}}</ref> A year later, the name of the awards category was changed to '''Outstanding Limited Series''', and the rules were made to distinguish that category from that of a movie by having the work have at least two episodes, and from that of a regular series by having no more than five episode.<ref name=2015rules /> The 2015 rule change allowed more short-seasons cable TV programs to compete, while prior rules had forced the same programs to compete in the same category with full seasons network programs.

What has been unique about this award in recent years (and even so today) is that there is almost always at least one nominee originating from [[Great Britain]]. For example, the [[2005 in television|2005]] winner was ''[[The Lost Prince]]'', which happened to be that year's British entry. The 2006 winner, ''[[Elizabeth I (2005 miniseries)|Elizabeth I]]'', was also a British miniseries, although it was a co-production with American television network [[HBO]]. Likewise, the [[2019 in television|most recent]] winner, ''[[Chernobyl (miniseries)|Chernobyl]]'', was a co-production of British and American companies (in this case, [[Sky UK]] and [[HBO]]).
