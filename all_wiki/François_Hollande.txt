'''François Gérard Georges Nicolas Hollande''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa ʒeʁaʁ ʒɔʁʒ nikɔla ɔlɑ̃d|lang|Fr-François Hollande.ogg}}; born 12 August 1954) is a French politician who served as [[President of France]] and ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'' [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince of Andorra]] from 2012 to 2017. He previously was [[First Secretary of the French Socialist Party|First Secretary]] of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] from 1997 to 2008, [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of [[Tulle]] from 2001 to 2008 and President of the [[Departmental Council of Corrèze|General Council of Corrèze]] from 2008 to 2012. Hollande also served in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] twice for the [[Corrèze's 1st constituency|first constituency]] of [[Corrèze]] from 1988 to 1993 and again from 1997 until 2012.

Born in [[Rouen]] and raised in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], Hollande began his political career as a special advisor to newly elected President [[François Mitterrand]], before serving as a staffer for [[Max Gallo]], the government's spokesman. He became a member of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] in 1988 and was elected [[First Secretary of the French Socialist Party|First Secretary of the Socialist Party]] in 1997. Following the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]] won by the Socialists, Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, but resigned as First Secretary and was immediately elected to replace [[Jean-Pierre Dupont]] as President of the [[Departmental council (France)|General Council]] of [[Corrèze]] in 2008. In 2011, Hollande announced that he would be a candidate in the [[2011 French Socialist Party presidential primary|primary election]] to select the Socialist Party presidential nominee; he won the nomination against [[Martine Aubry]] and was [[2012 French presidential election|elected]] to the presidency on 6 May 2012 during the second round with 51.6% of the vote, defeating incumbent [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].

During his tenure, Hollande legalised [[Same-sex marriage in France|same-sex marriage]] by passing [[Law 2013-404|Bill no. 344]], [[El Khomri law|reformed]] labour laws and credit training programmes, withdrew combat troops [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|present in the Afghanistan military intervention]]<ref name="guardianAC1" /><ref name=":0" /> and concluded an [[EU Directive 2010/63/EU|EU directive on the protection of animals in laboratory research]] through a [[France–Germany relations|Franco-German contract]]. Hollande led the country through the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|January]] and [[November 2015 Paris attacks|November 2015 Paris]] attacks, as well as the [[2016 Nice truck attack]]. He was a leading proponent of [[European migrant crisis|EU mandatory migrant quotas]] and [[NATO]]'s [[2011 military intervention in Libya]]. He also sent troops to [[Mali]] and the [[Central African Republic]] with the approval of the UN Security Council in order to stabilise those countries, two operations largely seen as successful.

When Hollande was thirteen, the family moved to [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], a highly exclusive suburb of Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thomaswhite.com/global-perspectives/francois-hollande-president-france/ |title=Global Players: Francois Hollande &#124; Thomas White International |publisher=Thomaswhite.com |access-date=15 May 2012}}</ref> He attended Saint-Jean-Baptiste-de-la-Salle boarding school, a private Catholic school in Rouen, the [[Lycée Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)|Lycée Pasteur]], in Neuilly-sur-Seine, receiving his baccalaureate in 1972 then graduated with a bachelor's degree in Law from [[Panthéon-Assas University]].

Hollande lived in the United States in the summer of 1974 as a university student.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/magazine/the-soft-middle-of-francois-hollande.html|title=The Soft Middle of François Hollande|last=Erlanger|first=Steven|date=15 April 2012|work=The New York Times|page=50|access-date=7 May 2012}}</ref> Immediately after graduation, he was employed as a councillor in the [[Court of Audit of France|Court of Audit]].

==Early political career==
Five years after volunteering as a student to work for [[François Mitterrand]]'s ultimately unsuccessful campaign in the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], Hollande joined the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]. He was quickly spotted by [[Jacques Attali]], a senior adviser to Mitterrand, who arranged for Hollande to run in [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election of 1981]] in [[Corrèze]] against future President [[Jacques Chirac]], who was then the leader of the [[Rally for the Republic]], a [[Neo-Gaullist]] party. Hollande lost to Chirac in the first round.

He went on to become a special advisor to newly elected President Mitterrand, before serving as a staffer for [[Max Gallo]], the government's spokesman. After becoming a municipal [[councillor]] for [[Ussel, Corrèze|Ussel]] in 1983, he contested Corrèze for a second time in [[1988 French legislative election|1988]], this time being elected to the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]]. Hollande lost his bid for re-election to the Assembly in the so-called "blue wave" of the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 election]], described as such due to the number of seats gained by the Right at the expense of the Socialist Party.

===First Secretary of the Socialist Party (1997–2008)===
[[File:François Hollande2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|François Hollande in 2005]]
As the end of Mitterrand's term in office approached, the Socialist Party was torn by a struggle of internal factions, each seeking to influence the direction of the party. Hollande pleaded for reconciliation and for the party to unite behind [[Jacques Delors]], the [[President of the European Commission]], but Delors renounced his ambitions to run for the French presidency in [[1995 French presidential election|1995]]. Former party leader [[Lionel Jospin]] resumed his position, and selected Hollande to become the official party spokesman. Hollande went on to contest Corrèze once again in [[1997 French legislative election|1997]], successfully returning to the National Assembly.

That same year, Jospin became the [[Prime Minister of France]], and Hollande won the election for his successor as [[First Secretary of the French Socialist Party|First Secretary]] of the party, a position he would hold for eleven years. Because of the very strong position of the Socialist Party within the [[French government]] during this period, Hollande's position led some to refer to him the "Vice Prime Minister". Hollande would go on to be elected [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Tulle]] in 2001, an office he would hold for the next seven years.

The immediate resignation of Jospin from politics following his shock defeat by far-right candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in the first round of the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential election]] forced Hollande to become the public face of the party for the [[2002 French legislative election|2002 legislative election]]. Although he managed to limit defeats and was re-elected in [[Corrèze's 1st Constituency|his own constituency]], the Socialists lost nationally. In order to prepare for the 2003 party congress in [[Dijon]], he obtained the support of many notable personalities of the party and was re-elected first secretary against opposition from left-wing factions.

After the triumph of the Left in the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]], Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, but the Socialists were divided on the [[European Constitution]], and Hollande's support for the ill-fated "Yes" position in the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|French referendum on the European constitution]] caused friction within the party. Although Hollande was re-elected as first secretary at the [[Le Mans Congress]] in 2005, his authority over the party began to decline. Eventually his domestic partner, [[Ségolène Royal]], was chosen to represent the party in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]], where she would lose to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].

Hollande was widely blamed for the poor performances of the Socialist Party in the [[2007 French legislative election|2007 elections]], and he announced that he would not seek another term as First Secretary. Hollande publicly declared his support for [[Bertrand Delanoë]], the [[mayor of Paris]], but it was [[Martine Aubry]] who would go on to win the race to succeed him in 2008. Hollande was next elected to replace [[Jean-Pierre Dupont]] as the president of the [[Corrèze General Council|General Council of Corrèze]] in April 2008, and won re-election in 2011.

===2012 presidential campaign===

{{See also|French presidential election, 2012}}
Hollande announced in early 2011 that he would be a candidate in the upcoming [[French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2011|primary election]] to select the Socialist and [[Radical Left Party]] presidential nominee.<ref>{{cite news|last=Albinet|first=Alain|title=L'appel de Tulle de François Hollande|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2011/03/31/l-appel-de-tulle-de-francois-hollande_1501495_823448.html|access-date=29 June 2011|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]|date=31 March 2011|language=French}}</ref> The primary marked the first time that both parties had held an open primary to select a joint nominee at the same time. He initially trailed the front-runner, former finance minister and [[International Monetary Fund]] managing director [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]]. Following Strauss-Kahn's [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn sexual assault case|arrest on suspicion of sexual assault]] in New York City in May 2011, Hollande began to lead the opinion polls, and his position as front-runner was established just as Strauss-Kahn declared that he would no longer seek the nomination. After a series of televised debates with other candidates throughout September, Hollande topped the ballot in the first round held on 9 October with 39% of the vote. He did not, however, gain the 50% required to avoid a [[run-off election]], and was obliged to enter a second ballot against [[Martine Aubry]], who had come in second with 30% of the vote.

The second ballot took place on 16 October 2011. Hollande won with 56% of the vote to Aubry's 43% and thus became the official Socialist and Radical Left Party candidate for the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=French Unions in National Strike on Pensions |first=Steven |last=Erlanger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/world/europe/08france.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=7 September 2010 |page=A4 |access-date=4 December 2010 |quote=[Socialist party leader Martine] Aubry has presidential ambitions...

Hollande was inaugurated on 15 May 2012, and shortly afterwards appointed [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] to be his [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]]. He was the first Socialist Party president since François Mitterrand left office in 1995. The President of the French Republic is one of the two [[Co-Princes of Andorra|joint heads of state]] of the Principality of [[Andorra]]. Hollande hosted a visit from [[Antoni Martí]], [[List of heads of government of Andorra|head of the government]], and [[Vicenç Mateu Zamora]], leader of the [[General Council of Andorra|parliament]].<ref>[http://www.20minutes.fr/ledirect/977281/francois-hollande-co-prince-andorre-recoit-responsables-principaute "François Hollande, co-prince d'Andorre, reçoit des responsables de la principauté"], ''20 minutes'', 26 July 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ambafrance-ad.org/Entretien-du-President-de-la "Entretien du Président de la République, M.

===Budget===
Hollande's economic policies are wide-ranging, including supporting the creation of a European [[credit rating agency]], the separation of lending and investment in banks, reducing the share of electricity generated by [[nuclear power in France]] from 75 to 50% in favour of [[renewable energy]] sources, merging [[income tax]] and the [[Taxation in France|General Social Contribution (CSG)]], creating an additional 45% for additional income of 150,000 euros, capping tax loopholes at a maximum of €10,000 per year, and questioning the relief [[solidarity tax on wealth]] (ISF, ''Impôt de Solidarité sur la Fortune'') measure that should bring €29 billion in additional revenue. Hollande also signalled his intent to implement a 75% income tax rate on revenue earned above 1,000,000 euros per year, to generate the provision of development funds for deprived suburbs, and to return to a deficit of zero percent of GDP by 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9042741/Francois-Hollande-outlines-manifesto-for-French-presidency-challenge.html |title=François Hollande outlines manifesto for French presidency challenge|work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=6 May 2012 |location=London |first=Henry |last=Samuel |date=26 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Le Figaro|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2012/01/26/97002-20120126FILWWW00727-hollande-equilibre-impossible-sans-croissance.php |title="2% de croissance": Hollande s'explique |access-date=6 May 2012}}</ref> The tax plan proved controversial, with courts ruling it unconstitutional in 2012, only to then take the opposite position on a redrafted version in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fouquet |first=Helene |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-29/french-court-says-75-tax-rate-on-wealthy-is-unconstitutional.html |title=French Court Says 75% Tax Rate on the Rich Is Unconstitutional |work=Bloomberg |date=29 December 2012 |access-date=16 June 2013}}{{Subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Petroff |first=Alanna |url=https://money.cnn.com/2013/12/30/news/economy/french-tax-75/ |title=France's 75% 'millionaire tax' to become law |work=Money.cnn.com |date=30 December 2013 |access-date=26 August 2014}}</ref>

Hollande had also announced several reforms to education, pledging to recruit 60,000 new teachers, to create a study allowance and means-tested training, and to set up a mutually beneficial contract that would allow a generation of experienced employees and craftsmen to be the guardians and teachers of younger newly hired employees, thereby creating a total of 150,000 subsidized jobs. This was complemented by the promise of aid to [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]], with the creation of a public bank investment-oriented SME's, and a reduction of the [[corporate tax]] rate to 30% for medium corporations and 15% for small.

Hollande's government has announced plans to construct 500,000 public homes per year, including 150,000 [[Public housing in France|social houses]], funded by a doubling of the ceiling of the [[Passbook|A passbook]], the [[Regions of France|region]] making available its [[local government#France|local government]] land within five years. In accordance with long-standing Socialist Party policy, Hollande has announced that the [[retirement age]] will revert to 60, for those who have [[Pensions in France|contributed]] for more than 41 years.

===Marriage and adoption for same-sex couples===

The bill to legalize same-sex marriage, known as Bill no. 344, was introduced to the [[National Assembly of France]] on 7 November 2012.

===Labour reform===
[[File:2016-03-09 11-35-56 manif-belfort.jpg|left|thumb|Demonstration against Hollande's labour reform in [[Belfort]], 2016]]
As President, Hollande pursued labour reform to make France more competitive internationally. Legislation was introduced in late 2012 and after much debate passed the French lower and upper house in May 2013. The bill includes measures such as making it easier for workers to change jobs and for companies to fire employees. One of the main measures of the bill allows companies to temporarily cut workers' salaries or hours during times of economic difficulty. This measure takes its inspiration from Germany, where furloughs have been credited with allowing companies to weather difficult times without resorting to massive layoffs. Layoffs in France are often challenged in courts and the cases can take years to resolve. Many companies cite the threat of lengthy court action&nbsp;– even more than any financial cost – as the most difficult part of doing business in France. The law shortens the time that employees have to contest a layoff and also lays out a scheme for severance pay. The government hopes this will help employees and companies reach agreement faster in contentious layoffs.<ref name=labour>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/france-approves-major-labor-reform-package-160144959.html |title= France approves major labor reform package|author=Dilorenzo, Sarah|work=yahoo.com |date=14 May 2013 |access-date=4 January 2014}}</ref>
 
Another key measure introduced are credits for training that follow employees throughout their career, regardless of where they work, and the right to take a leave of absence to work at another company. The law will also require all companies to offer and partially pay for supplemental health insurance. Lastly, the law also reforms unemployment insurance, so that someone out of work doesn't risk foregoing significant benefits when taking a job that might pay less than previous work or end up only being temporary. Under the new law, workers will be able to essentially put benefits on hold when they take temporary work, instead of seeing their benefits recalculated each time.<ref name=labour/>

===Pension reform===
As President, Hollande pursued reform to the pension system in France. The process proved to be very contentious, with members of Parliament, Labor Unions, and general public all opposed. Mass protests and demonstrations occurred throughout Paris. Despite the opposition, the French Parliament did pass a reform in December 2013 aimed at plugging a pension deficit expected to reach 20.7 billion euros ($28.4 billion) by 2020 if nothing were to be done. Rather than raising the mandatory retirement age, as many economists had advised, Hollande pursued increases in contributions, leaving the retirement age untouched. The reform had a rough ride in parliament, being rejected twice by the Senate, where Hollande's Socialist Party has a slim majority, before it won sufficient backing in a final vote before the lower house of parliament. French private sector workers will see the size and duration of their pension contributions increase only modestly under the reform while their retirement benefits are largely untouched.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/20393182/french-parliament-approves-pension-reform/ |title=French parliament approves pension reform |agency=Reuters |date=19 December 2013 |access-date=4 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104203944/http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/20393182/french-parliament-approves-pension-reform/ |archivedate=4 January 2014}}</ref>

For twenty nine years, his [[domestic partnership|partner]] was fellow Socialist politician [[Ségolène Royal]], with whom he has four children: Thomas (1984), Clémence (1985), Julien (1987) and Flora (1992). In June 2007, just a month after Royal's defeat in the [[French presidential election of 2007]], the couple announced that they were separating.<ref>{{Cite news |title=French Socialists' First Couple Disclose a Parting of Ways |first=Elaine |last=Sciolino |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/world/europe/19france.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=19 June 2007 |page=A3 |access-date=4 December 2010 }}</ref>

A few months after his split from Ségolène Royal was announced, a French website published details of a relationship between Hollande and French journalist [[Valérie Trierweiler]]. In November 2007, Trierweiler confirmed and openly discussed her relationship with Hollande in an interview with the French weekly ''[[Télé 7 Jours]]''. She remained a reporter for the magazine ''[[Paris Match]]'', but ceased work on political stories. Trierweiler moved into the Élysée Palace with Hollande when he became president and started to accompany him on official travel.<ref>

The memoir claimed the president presented himself as disliking the rich, but in reality disliked the poor. The claim brought an angry reaction and rejection from Hollande, who said he had spent his life dedicated to the under-privileged.<ref name="HollandePoor">{{cite news|title=Upset Hollande hits back at former girlfriend's accusations|url=http://www.parisnews.net/index.php/sid/225439693|date=5 September 2014|access-date=7 September 2014|publisher=Paris News.Net}}</ref>
