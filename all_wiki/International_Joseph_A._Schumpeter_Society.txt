The '''International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society''' (ISS) is an economics association aimed at furthering research in the spirit of [[Joseph Schumpeter]]. [[Wolfgang Stolper|Wolfgang F. Stolper]] and Horst Hanusch initiated the foundation of the society in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.issevec.uni-jena.de/General+information.html|title=General information|website=www.issevec.uni-jena.de|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>

The primary objective of the International Joseph Alois Schumpeter Society is the advancement of knowledge in the broad research area of the dynamics of structural change, its origins, and its effects. These topics include studies addressing the role of the dynamic entrepreneur, the political and social problems of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial history as well as research question concerning income distribution, technical change, and employment. The society welcomes scientifically sound and non-ideological research by scholars of all scholarly traditions. Following Joseph Schumpeter, research should respect "facts as they are and behave and not as one wishes them to be or behave."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.issevec.uni-jena.de/General+information/Aims+of+the+Society.html|title=Aims of the International Schumpeter Society|website=www.issevec.uni-jena.de|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>

The ISS organizes a biannual conference on topics that mirror Schumpeterian ideas, helps financing international conferences, and promotes the dissemination of research through conference proceedings and other publications. Recent scholarly contributions related to Schumpeter are awarded with academic prizes by the ISS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.issevec.uni-jena.de/General+information/Aims+of+the+Society.html|title=Aims of the International Schumpeter Society|website=www.issevec.uni-jena.de|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.knowledge.unibocconi.eu/notizia.php?idArt=10621|title=The Schumpeter Prize 2012 Goes to Franco Malerba and Luigi Orsenigo|website=www.knowledge.unibocconi.eu|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref> In 1993 the Society adopted the [[Journal of Evolutionary Economics]], founded in 1991, as its house journal.<ref name="hist">International Joseph A.
