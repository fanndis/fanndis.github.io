"'''The Closer I Get to You'''" is a romantic [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]] performed by singer-songwriter [[Roberta Flack]] and soul musician [[Donny Hathaway]]. The song was written by [[James Mtume]] and [[Reggie Lucas]], two former members of [[Miles Davis]]'s band, who were members of Flack's band at the time. Produced by [[Atlantic Records]], the song was released on Flack's 1977 album ''[[Blue Lights in the Basement]]'', and as a single in 1978. It became a major crossover hit, becoming Flack's biggest commercial hit after her success with her 1973 solo single, "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]". Originally set as a solo-single, Flack's manager, David Franklin, suggested a duet with Hathaway, which resulted in the finished work.

"The Closer I Get to You" spent two weeks as number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Singles]] chart in April 1978, and peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] behind [[Yvonne Elliman]]'s "[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]" and [[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]]' "[[With a Little Luck]]". The song charted in the top ten spots for fourteen weeks in Canada and one week in France. It was eventually [[Music recording sales certification|certified gold]] in the United States in May 1978, and became one of their most familiar duets.

==Background and composition==
"The Closer I Get to You" was written by [[Reggie Lucas]] and [[James Mtume]], who were members of [[Roberta Flack]]'s touring band and played on ''[[Blue Lights in the Basement]]''.<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Ed|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/the-closer-i-get-to-you-t2761141|title=The Closer I Get to You |publisher=[[Allmusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> They wrote the song between tours and, during the sessions for the album, brought it to Flack's producer Joe Ferla, who played it for Flack. Ferla, Flack (as Rubina Flake) and [[Gene McDaniels]] produced the track, with Ahmet Ertegun serving as executive producer.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=The Closer I Get To You / Love Is The Healing |others=[[Roberta Flack]] and [[Donny Hathaway]] |date=1977  |publisher=[[Atlantic Records]]}}</ref> Flack and [[Donny Hathaway]], good friends while attending [[Howard University]], had recorded a [[Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway|self-titled album of duets]] in 1972.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/q6cg |title=Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway Review |first=Daryl |last=Easlea |publisher=[[BBC Music]] |year=2011 |accessdate=February 2, 2014}}</ref> Five years later, the duo collaborated again on "The Closer I Get to You".<ref name="billboard1">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/473075/the-40-biggest-duets-of-all-time |title=The 40 Biggest Duets Of All Time |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|page=1|date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 9, 2011}}</ref>

"The Closer I Get to You" was not originally written as a duet. Flack's manager David Franklin, who had worked with Hathaway in the past, decided to re-write the song to include him. Hathaway had been suffering from severe bouts of [[clinical depression]] at the time, which often forced him to be hospitalized. The depression also caused mood swings, which adversely affected his partnership with Flack,<ref>{{cite book|title=All Music Guide to Soul: The Definitive Guide to R&B and Soul|first=Vladimir|last=Bogdanov|isbn=0879307447|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|date=August 14, 2003}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}</ref> who, following Hathaway's death, would tell ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' magazine:
<blockquote>I tried to reach out to Donny. That's how we managed to do the song we did last year. I felt this need because I didn't know what to do. I couldn't save him, I knew he was sick. But I knew when he sat down at that piano and sang for me it was like it was eight or nine years ago because he sang and played his ass off.<ref name="google2">{{cite magazine |title=The Two Sides of Roberta Flack |magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company]]|page=45|date=November 29, 1979 |volume=57|number=11|issn=0021-5996}}</ref>
</blockquote> In fact Hathaway's suffering had made it impossible for him to travel from Chicago to New York City to join Flack in the studio to record "The Closer I Get to You": Flack recorded her part of the song with a session singer as a stopgap duet partner, the track being sent to Chicago for Hathaway to add his vocal and then back to New York City for its final mixing.<ref>http://1beat.de/interview/interview-roberta-flack/</ref>

Flack announced that "The Closer I Get to You" would forever be a dedication to Hathaway, and that all money made from the song would be donated to Hathaway's widow and two children.<ref name="google2"/> According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], "The Closer I Get to You" is set in [[common time]] and moves at a [[tempo]] of 90 beats per minute.

==Music video==
A [[music video]] for "The Closer I Get to You" was shot and directed by Roberta Flack herself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/videos/roberta-flack/309956/the-closer-i-get-to-you.jhtml |title=Videos : Roberta Flack : The Closer I Get To You |publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|accessdate=August 24, 2011}}</ref> The video begins with Flack's singing while sitting by a piano in a candle-lit room. Hathaway had died by the time the music video was shot, so as his verse plays, the camera zooms into a picture of Hathaway located on a table behind Flack's shoulder. Flack performs the rest of the song sitting by the piano, and the camera's direction occasionally looks over a candle flame during Hathaway's verses. The video ends with Flack's mouthing some of Hathaway's lyrics as she fades into the camera's view of the room lit by a single candle. A version of Flack's performing the song live circulated as its promotional music video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/roberta-flack/309956/the-closer-i-get-to-you.jhtml |title=The Closer I Get to You - Roberta Flack - Music Videos |publisher=MTV.
