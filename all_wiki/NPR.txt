'''National Public Radio''' ('''NPR''', stylized in [[all lowercase]]) is an American privately and publicly funded non-profit media organization based in [[Washington, D.C.]] NPR differs from other non-profit membership media organizations, such as [[Associated Press|AP]], in that it was established by an act of Congress<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cpb.org/aboutpb/act/ | title=Public Broadcasting Act of 1967| date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> and most of its member stations are owned by government entities (often public universities). It serves as a national [[Radio syndication|syndicator]] to a network of over 1,000 [[public radio]] [[List of NPR stations|stations]] in the United States.<ref name="Audience">{{cite web |url=http://nationalpublicmedia.com/npr/audience/ |title=Audience |publisher=NPR |access-date=January 23, 2018}}</ref>

NPR produces and distributes news and cultural programming. The organization's flagship shows are two [[drive time|drive-time]] news broadcasts, ''[[Morning Edition]]'' and the afternoon ''[[All Things Considered]]''; both are carried by most NPR member stations, and are among the [[List of most-listened-to radio programs|most popular radio programs]] in the country.<ref name="All Things Considered">>{{cite web | url=http://nationalpublicmedia.com/npr/programs/all-things-considered/ | title=All Things Considered | quote=Heard by 13.3 million people on 814 radio stations each week, All Things Considered is one of the most popular programs in America. | publisher=National Public Media | access-date=October 12, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Morning Edition">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Jack W. |title=Listener supported: the culture and history of public radio |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |quote=Conceived as "alternatives," ''Morning Edition'' and ''All Things Considered'' are the second and third most listened-to radio programs in the ...|page=175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIwTKWj04wEC&pg=PA175 |isbn=978-0-275-98352-9}}</ref> {{As of|March 2018}}, the drive time programs attract an audience of 14.9 million and 14.7 million per week respectively.<ref>{{cite news|title=NPR Maintains Highest Ratings Ever|url=https://www.npr.org/about-npr/597590072/npr-maintains-highest-ratings-ever|access-date=May 10, 2018|work=NPR.org|date=March 28, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

NPR manages the [[Public Radio Satellite System]], which distributes NPR programs and other programming from independent producers and networks such as American Public Media and Public Radio International. Its content is also available on-demand online, on mobile networks, and, in many cases, as [[podcast]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/podcasts/|title=Podcast Directory|website=npr.org}}</ref>

==Name==
The organization's legal name is ''National Public Radio'' and its [[trademark]]ed brand is ''NPR''; it is known by both names.<ref name="Name">Dana Davis Rehm, [https://www.npr.org/sections/inside/2010/07/12/128475395/npr-what-s-in-a-name NPR: What's In A Name?], NPR (July 12, 2012).</ref> In June 2010, the organization announced that it was "making a conscious effort to consistently refer to ourselves as NPR on-air and online" because NPR is the common name for the organization and the tag line "This ... is NPR" has been used by its radio hosts for many years.<ref name="Name"/> However, ''National Public Radio'' remains the legal name of the group, as it has been since 1970.<ref name="Name"/>

==History==

===1970s===
[[File:NPR 1970s logo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|1970s logo]]

National Public Radio replaced the [[National Educational Radio Network]] on February 26, 1970, following Congressional passage of the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967]].<ref name="JARVIK">{{cite book |last=Jarvik |first=Laurence Ariel |date=1997 |title=PBS, behind the screen |location=Rocklin, CA |publisher=Forum |isbn=978-0761506683 }}</ref> This act was signed into law by 36th  [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and established the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], which also created the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)]] for television in addition to NPR. A CPB organizing committee under John Witherspoon first created a board of directors chaired by [[Bernard Mayes]].

The board then hired [[Don Quayle|Donald Quayle]] to be the first president of NPR with 30 employees and 90 charter member local stations, and studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/about/aboutnpr/history.html#history |title= History |publisher= NPR |access-date= February 24, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110222185012/http://www.npr.org/about/aboutnpr/history.html#history |archive-date= February 22, 2011 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

NPR aired its first broadcast on April 20, 1971, covering [[United States Senate]] hearings on the ongoing [[Vietnam War]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. The afternoon drive-time newscast ''[[All Things Considered]]'' premiered on May 3, 1971, first hosted by [[Robert Conley (reporter)|Robert Conley]]. NPR was primarily a production and distribution organization until 1977, when it merged with the [[Association of Public Radio Stations]]. ''[[Morning Edition]]'' premiered on November 5, 1979, first hosted by [[Bob Edwards]].

===1980s===
NPR suffered an almost-fatal setback in 1983 when efforts to expand services created a deficit of nearly $7 million (equivalent to $18 million in 2018 dollars). After a Congressional investigation and the resignation of NPR's then-president [[Frank Mankiewicz]], the Corporation for Public Broadcasting agreed to lend the network money in order to stave off bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.current.org/pbpb/documents/GAOonNPR84.html | title=GAO statement on NPR financial crisis, 1984 | publisher=Public Broadcasting PolicyBase at [[Current.org]] | year=1984 | access-date=June 12, 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903205828/http://www.current.org/pbpb/documents/GAOonNPR84.html | archive-date=September 3, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> In exchange, NPR agreed to a new arrangement whereby the annual CPB stipend that it had previously received directly would be divided among local stations instead; in turn, those stations would support NPR productions on a subscription basis. NPR also agreed to turn its satellite service into a cooperative venture (the [[Public Radio Satellite System]]), making it possible for non-NPR shows to get national distribution. It took NPR approximately three years to pay off the debt.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.current.org/history/timeline/timeline-1980s.shtml#1986 | title= History of public broadcasting in the United States | publisher= [[Current.org]] | access-date= June 12, 2007 | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070914013054/http://www.current.org/history/timeline/timeline-1980s.shtml#1986 | archive-date= September 14, 2007 | df= mdy-all }}</ref>

In November 2003, NPR received $235 million from the estate of the late [[Joan B. Kroc]], the widow of [[Ray Kroc]], founder of [[McDonald's Corporation]]. This was the largest monetary gift ever to a cultural institution.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |title=Billions and Billions Served, Hundreds of Millions Donated  |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04EFD81439F934A35752C1A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |quote= National Public Radio announced yesterday that it had received a bequest worth at least $200 million from the widow of the longtime chairman of the McDonald's restaurant chain.

In August 2005, NPR entered podcasting with a directory of over 170 programs created by NPR and member stations.  By November of that year, users downloaded NPR and other public radio podcasts 5 million times. Ten years later, by March 2015, users downloaded podcasts produced only by NPR 94 million times,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thisisnpr/2015/08/31/435603490/npr-podcasts-turn-10|title=NPR Podcasts Turn 10!}}</ref> and NPR podcasts like ''Fresh Air'' and the ''TED Radio Hour'' routinely made the [[iTunes]] Top Podcasts list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itunescharts.net/us/charts/podcasts/|title=iTunesCharts.net: US Podcasts}}</ref>

==Governance==
NPR is a membership organization. Member stations are required to be [[non-commercial]] or [[non-commercial educational]] radio stations; have at least five full-time professional employees; operate for at least 18 hours per day; and not be designed solely to further a [[religious broadcasting]] philosophy or be used for classroom [[distance learning]] programming. Each member station receives one vote at the annual NPR board meetings—exercised by its designated Authorized Station Representative ("A-Rep").

To oversee the day-to-day operations and prepare its budget, members elect a board of directors. The board was previously composed of ten A-Reps, five members of the general public, and the chair of the NPR Foundation. On November 2, 2015, NPR Members approved a change in the NPR Bylaws to expand the Board of Directors to 23 directors, consisting of 12 Member Directors who are managers of NPR Member stations and are elected to the Board by their fellow Member stations, 9 Public Directors who are prominent members of the public selected by the Board and confirmed by NPR Member stations, the NPR Foundation Chair, and the NPR President & CEO.<ref name="NPR Board">{{cite web

In 2010, NPR revenues totaled $180 million, with the bulk of revenues coming from programming fees, [[Grant (money)|grants]] from [[foundation (charity)|foundations]] or business entities, contributions and [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]].<ref name="npr" /> According to the 2009 financial statement, about 50% of NPR revenues come from the fees it charges member stations for programming and distribution charges.<ref name="npr" /> Typically, NPR member stations receive funds through on-air [[pledge drive]]s, corporate underwriting, state and local governments, educational institutions, and the federally funded [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (CPB). In 2009, member stations derived 6% of their revenue from federal, state and local government funding, 10% of their revenue from [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting|CPB]] grants, and 14% of their revenue from universities.<ref name="npr">{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/about/aboutnpr/publicradiofinances.html |title=Public Radio Finances |publisher=NPR |access-date=October 22, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319015536/http://www.npr.org/about/aboutnpr/publicradiofinances.html |archive-date=March 19, 2012  }}</ref><ref name="NPR Responds">{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2009/02/npr_responds.asp|title=NPR Responds|access-date=January 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024042200/http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2009/02/npr_responds.asp|archive-date=October 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> While NPR does not receive any direct federal funding, it does receive a small number of competitive grants from CPB and federal agencies like the Department of Education and the Department of Commerce. This funding amounts to approximately 2% of NPR's overall revenues.<ref name="npr" />

During the 1970s and early 1980s, the majority of NPR funding came from the federal government. Steps were taken during the Reagan administration in the 1980s to completely wean NPR from government support, but [[#History|the 1983 funding crisis]] forced the network to make immediate changes. According to [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting|CPB]], in 2009 11.3% of the aggregate revenues of all public radio broadcasting stations were funded from federal sources, principally through CPB;<ref name="CPB2009">{{cite web |url= http://www.cpb.org/stations/reports/revenue/2009PublicBroadcastingRevenue.pdf |title= Table 2 Public Broadcasting Revenue by Public Television and Radio System and Source of Revenue, Fiscal Year 2008–2009 |work= Public Broadcasting Revenue Fiscal Year 2009 |publisher= Corporation for Public Broadcasting |access-date= August 5, 2011 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110623081629/http://cpb.org/stations/reports/revenue/2009PublicBroadcastingRevenue.pdf |archive-date= June 23, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> in 2012 10.9% of the revenues for Public Radio came from federal sources.<ref name="CPB2012">{{cite web |url=http://www.cpb.org/stations/reports/revenue/2012PublicBroadcastingRevenue.pdf |title=Table 2 Public Broadcasting Revenue by Public Television and Radio System and Source of Revenue, Fiscal Year 2011–2012 |work=Public Broadcasting Revenue Fiscal Year 2012 |publisher=Corporation for Public Broadcasting |access-date=February 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301170647/http://www.cpb.org/stations/reports/revenue/2012PublicBroadcastingRevenue.pdf |archive-date=March 1, 2014  }}</ref>

In 2011, NPR announced the roll-out of their own online [[advertising network]], which allows member stations to run geographically [[targeted advertising|targeted advertisement]] spots from national sponsors that may otherwise be unavailable to their local area, opening additional revenue streams to the broadcaster.<ref>Ungerleider, Neal.

''Center Stage'', a mix of [[native advertising]] and [[banner ad]] featured prominently on the NPR homepage, above-the-fold, was launched in 2013. The launch partner for ''Center Stage'' was [[Squarespace]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Taintor, David|title=NPR's New Ad Unit Falls Somewhere Between Banners and Native|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/nprs-new-ad-unit-falls-somewhere-between-banners-and-native-151928|work=[[Adweek]]|date=August 16, 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, NPR CEO Jarl Mohn said the network would begin to increase revenue by having brands NPR views as more relevant to the audience underwrite NPR programs and requesting higher rates from them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hart|first1=Peter|title=New NPR Boss: 'We're Going to Be Talking About Brands That Matter a Little Bit More'|url=http://fair.org/blog/2014/09/08/new-npr-boss-were-going-to-be-talking-about-brands-that-matter-a-little-bit-more/|website=fair.org|publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]]|date=September 8, 2014}}</ref>

===Underwriting spots vs. commercials===
In contrast with [[commercial broadcasting]], NPR's radio broadcasts do not carry traditional commercials, but has advertising in the form of brief statements from major sponsors which may include corporate [[Advertising slogan|slogans]], descriptions of products and services, and contact information such as website addresses and [[telephone number]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=NPR Underwriting Credit Guidelines|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/NPR%20Underwriting%20Credit%20Guidelines.pdf|website=npr.org|publisher=NRP|access-date=June 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602125811/http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/NPR%20Underwriting%20Credit%20Guidelines.pdf|archive-date=June 2, 2014|page=1|date=November 24, 2008}}</ref> These statements are called [[underwriting spot]]s and, unlike commercials, are governed by specific FCC restrictions in addition to [[False advertising|truth in advertising]] laws; they cannot advocate a product or "promote the goods and services" of for-profit entities.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Public and Broadcasting|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/public-and-broadcasting-july-2008#UNDERWRITING|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=March 3, 2013|year=2008}}</ref> These restrictions apply only to radio broadcasts and not NPR's other digital platforms.

NPR stations generally subscribe to the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating service]], but are not included in published ratings and rankings such as ''[[Radio & Records]]''. NPR station listenership is measured by Nielsen in both Diary and PPM (people meter) markets. NPR stations are frequently not included in "summary level" diary data used by most advertising agencies for media planning. Data on NPR listening can be accessed using "respondent level" diary data. Additionally, all radio stations (public and commercial) are treated equally within the PPM data sets making NPR station listenership data much more widely available to the media planning community. NPR's signature morning news program, ''Morning Edition'', is the network's most popular program, drawing 14.63 million listeners a week, with its afternoon newsmagazine, ''All Things Considered'', a close second, with 14.6 million listeners a week according to 2017 Nielsen ratings data.<ref name="Growth">[https://www.npr.org/about-npr/559791315/npr-stations-audience-grows-for-fifth-consecutive-national-ratings-period NPR Reaches 99 Million People Monthly, GenXers And Millennials Drive Growth] ''NPR,'' October 25, 2017.

===Notable public radio programs not affiliated with NPR===
Many shows broadcast on U.S. public radio stations are not affiliated with NPR. Individual NPR stations can broadcast programming from sources that have no formal affiliation with NPR. If these programs are distributed by another distributor, a public radio station must also affiliate with that network to take that network's programming.

[[Public Radio International]], [[American Public Media]] and [[Public Radio Exchange]] are other major public radio production and distribution organizations with distinct missions, and each competes with the other and NPR for programming slots on public radio stations.

Most public radio stations are NPR member stations and many are affiliate stations of PRI, APM & PRX ''at the same time''. The organizations have different governance structures and missions and relationships with stations.

==Controversies==
{{Main|NPR controversies}}

Over the course of NPR's history, controversies have arisen over several incidents and topics.

===Allegations of ideological bias===
NPR has been accused of displaying both liberal bias, as alleged in work such as a [[UCLA]] and [[University of Missouri]] study of ''Morning Edition'', and conservative bias, including criticism of alleged reliance on conservative [[think-tank]]s.<ref name="OTM_Bias">{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/133120-does-public-radio-have-a-liberal-bias-the-finale/|title=Does Public Radio Have A Liberal Bias? The Finale!|date=March 25, 2011|publisher=WNYC|format=Radio Transcript|work=On The Media|access-date=September 4, 2011}}</ref> NPR has also been accused of bias related to specific topics, including support of the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]] and coverage of [[Israel]]. Their [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] reporting has been accused of being "little more than Pentagon press releases."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ragusea |first1=Adam |author-link1=Adam Ragusea |title=A critic sees "pro-government" bias in NPR's reporting, not a leftward lean |url=https://current.org/2016/03/a-critic-sees-pro-government-bias-in-nprs-reporting/ |website=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]] |access-date=May 12, 2020 |date=March 15, 2016}}</ref> The NPR ombudsman has described how NPR's coverage of the Israel-Palestinian conflict has been simultaneously criticized as biased by both sides.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2010/06/17/127895293/listeners-hear-same-israeli-palestinian-coverage-differently Listeners Hear Same Israeli-Palestinian Coverage Differently]; NPR Ombudsman; June 18, 2010</ref> University of Texas journalism professor and author [[Robert W.

During the 2020 election, NPR declined to cover the controversy surrounding a New York Post article on Hunter Biden, saying "We don't want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories, and we don't want to waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on stories that are just pure distractions, ..."<ref>NPR Public Editor{{cite web | url=http://view.nl.npr.org/?qs=22d4bf85a85c320fdbaf58ecc1ada89b69c273b668447c793870a4e78166bda1fdad86a87553c1aea814d8820cde92276959de8ba03daa8ee1175aa615825563a607dc9fb9496fd7b441d8f8f939ec63 | access-date=Nov 2, 2020 | title=Responding to the New York Post }}</ref>

===Euphemisms===
In a controversial act, NPR banned in 2009 the use of the word "torture" in the context of the [[Enhanced_interrogation_techniques|Bush administration's use of torture]].<ref>[http://www.salon.com/2009/07/02/npr_2/ "The still-growing NPR "torture" controversy"] ''[[Salon.com]]'' July 2, 2009</ref> NPR's Ombudswoman [[Alicia Shepard]]'s defense of the policy was that "calling waterboarding torture is tantamount to taking sides."<ref>[http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2009/06/26/02 Torturous Wording] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704115001/http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2009/06/26/02 |date=July 4, 2009 }} NPR (transcript) June 26, 2009</ref> But [[UC Berkeley School of Information|Berkeley]] Professor of Linguistics [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] pointed out that virtually all media around the world, other than what he called the "spineless U.S. media", call these techniques torture.<ref>[http://www.scpr.org/programs/patt-morrison/2009/06/26/729/calling-a-spade-a-spade-use-of-the-word-torture/ "Calling a Spade a Spade: Use of the Word 'Torture'"], [[KPCC (radio station)|KPCC]] June 26, 2009</ref><ref>McQuaid, John.[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/may/12/torture-new-york-times-washington-post "The semantics of torture"] ''[[Comment is free|guardian.co.uk – Comment-is-free]]'' May 13, 2009.</ref> In an article which criticized NPR and other U.S. media for their use of euphemisms for torture, [[Glenn Greenwald]] discussed what he called the enabling "corruption of American journalism":

<blockquote>This active media complicity in concealing that our Government created a systematic torture regime, by refusing ever to say so, is one of the principal reasons it was allowed to happen for so long. The steadfast, ongoing refusal of our leading media institutions to refer to what the Bush administration did as "torture"&nbsp;– even in the face of more than 100 detainee deaths; the use of that term by a leading Bush official to describe what was done at Guantanamo; and the fact that media outlets frequently use the word "torture" to describe exactly the same methods when used by other countries – reveals much about how the modern journalist thinks.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/2009/06/06/nyt_5/ "The NYT's nice, new euphemism for torture"], ''Salon.com'' June 6, 2009</ref></blockquote>

===Sexual harassment===
In October 2017, sexual harassment charges were leveled against [[Michael Oreskes]], senior vice president of news and editorial director since 2015. Some of the accusations dated back to when he was Washington, D.C. bureau chief for ''[[The New York Times]]'' during the 1990s, while others involved his conduct at NPR.<ref>{{cite news|last=Farhi |first=Paul |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/nprs-top-editor-accused-of-sexual-harassment-by-two-women/2017/10/31/a2078bea-bdf7-11e7-959c-fe2b598d8c00_story.html |title=NPR's top editor placed on leave after accusations of sexual harassment |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 31, 2017 |access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref> After a report on the ''Times'' accusations was published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', NPR put Oreskes on administrative leave, and the following day his resignation was requested.<ref>{{cite news |last=Folkenflik |first=David |title=NPR's Head Of News Placed On Leave After Past Harassment Allegations Surface |date=October 31, 2017 |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/31/561267272/nprs-head-of-news-placed-on-leave-after-past-harassment-allegations-surface |publisher=NPR |access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Stelter |first1=Brian |last2=Smith |first2=Aaron |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/01/media/michael-oreskes-npr/index.html |title=Top NPR editor resigns amid allegations of harassment |publisher=CNN |date=November 1, 2017 |access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite web|last=Farhi |first=Paul |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/top-newsroom-official-at-npr-resigns-amid-harassment-allegations/2017/11/01/d26d682c-bf1e-11e7-8444-a0d4f04b89eb_story.html |title=Michael Oreskes, top NPR newsroom official, resigns amid harassment allegations |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 1, 2017 |access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref> CNN's [[Brian Stelter]] reported that NPR staffers were dissatisfied with the handling of Oreskes, were demanding an external investigation, and that  Oreskes poisoned the newsroom atmosphere by abusing his position to meet young women.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Stelter |first=Brian |date=November 2, 2017 |title=At NPR, Oreskes harassment scandal leaves deep wounds |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/01/media/npr-michael-oreskes-resigns-fallout/index.html |publisher=[[CNNMoney]] |access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref>

===''Live from Death Row'' commentaries===
In 1994, NPR arranged to air, on ''All Things Considered'', a series of three-minute commentaries by [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], a journalist convicted in a controversial trial of murdering [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia Police]] officer Daniel Faulkner. They cancelled airing them after the [[Fraternal Order of Police]] and members of the U.S. Congress objected.<ref name=WaPoAbul-Jamal>{{Cite news

===Ronald Schiller comments===
In March 2011, conservative political activist and provocateur [[James O'Keefe]] sent partners Simon Templar (a [[pen name]]) and Shaughn Adeleye<ref name="nprexec">{{cite news|publisher = [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|url = http://www.politico.com/blogs/onmedia/0311/NPR_exec_tea_party_is_scary_racist.html?showall|date = March 8, 2011|title = NPR exec: tea party is 'scary,' 'racist'|first = Keach|last = Hagey}}</ref> to secretly record their discussion with Ronald Schiller, NPR's outgoing senior vice president for [[fundraising]], and an associate, in which Schiller made remarks viewed as disparaging of "the current Republican party, especially the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]]", and controversial comments regarding Palestine and funding for NPR. NPR disavowed Schiller's comments. CEO Vivian Schiller, who is not related to Ronald, later resigned over the fallout from the comments and the previous firing of Juan Williams.<ref>{{cite news | author = Mark Memmott | title = NPR CEO Vivian Schiller resigns | publisher = NPR | date=March 9, 2011 | access-date = March 9, 2011 | url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/03/09/134388981/npr-ceo-vivian-schiller-resigns}}</ref>

=== July 4 tweets of the Declaration of Independence ===
Starting on July 4, 1988, NPR has broadcast an annual reading of the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]] over the radio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/04/483757766/the-declaration-of-independence-240-years-later|title=The Declaration Of Independence, 240 Years Later|website=NPR.org|access-date=July 5, 2017}}</ref> In 2017 it began using [[Twitter]] as a medium for reading the document as well. On July 4, 2017, the 100+ tweets were met with considerable opposition, some online supporters of [[Donald Trump]] mistakenly believing the words of the Declaration referring to [[George III of the United Kingdom]] to be directed towards the president. The tweets were called "trash"<ref name=kc/> and were accused of being left-wing propaganda,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/07/05/some-trump-supporters-thought-npr-tweeted-propaganda-it-was-the-declaration-of-independence/|title=Some Trump supporters thought NPR tweeted 'propaganda.'
