==Background==
Arden was born on New Year's Eve, 1881, in [[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Her parents had emigrated to Canada from [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom, in the 1870s. Her father, William Graham, was [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and her mother, Susan (Tadd), was [[Cornish people|Cornish]] and had arranged for a wealthy aunt in Cornwall to pay for her children's education.<ref>Sawyers, June Skinner (1966). ''Famous Firsts of Scottish-Americans''. Pelican Publishing, p. 11.</ref> Arden dropped out of [[nursing school]] in Toronto.<ref>Davidson, Hilary. ''Frommer's Guide to Toronto 2004''. p. 262. {{ISBN|0-7645-4060-2}}.</ref><ref>https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/arden-elizabeth-1878-1966</ref>

She then joined her elder brother in [[Manhattan]], working briefly as a [[bookkeeper]] for the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|E. R. Squibb Pharmaceuticals Company]]. While there, Arden spent hours in their lab, learning about [[skincare]]. She then worked—again briefly—for Eleanor Adair, an early beauty culturist, as a "treatment girl".

In her salons and through her marketing campaigns, Elizabeth Arden stressed teaching women how to apply makeup and pioneered such concepts as scientific formulation of cosmetics, beauty makeovers, and coordinating colors of eye, lip and facial makeup.{{fact|date=December 2018}}

Elizabeth Arden was largely responsible for establishing makeup as proper and appropriate, even necessary, for a ladylike image, when before makeup had often been associated with lower classes and prostitutes. She targeted middle age and plain women for whom beauty products promised a youthful, beautiful image.{{fact|date=December 2018}}

Arden was a dedicated [[suffragette]], marching for [[women's rights]] in 1912. She supplied the marchers with red lipstick as a sign of solidarity.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Elizabeth Arden - Entrepreneur - Biography|url=https://www.biography.com/business-figure/elizabeth-arden|access-date=2020-10-18|website=www.biography.com}}</ref><ref name="jj">{{Cite web|last=Lewis|first=Jone Johnson|date=2015|title=ThoughtCo|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/elizabeth-arden-biography-3528897|access-date=October 18, 2020}}</ref>

In 1909, Arden formed a partnership with Elizabeth Hubbard, another culturist. The business relationship dissolved in 1910.<ref>{{Cite news|title=BUSINESS TROUBLES|date=August 16, 1910|work=New York Times}}</ref> Graham, who desired a [[trade name]], used "Elizabeth" to save money on her salon signs. She chose the last name, "Arden", from a nearby farm. So the trade name "Elizabeth Arden" was formed.<ref name=jj/> From there, Arden founded, in 1910, the ''Red Door'' salon in New York, which has remained synonymous with her name ever since (see under [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In 1912, Arden traveled to France to learn beauty and facial [[massage]] techniques used in the Paris [[beauty salon]]s. She returned with a collection of [[Rouge (cosmetics)|rouges]] and tinted powders she had created. She began expanding her international operations in 1915 and started opening salons across the world. In 1934, she opened the Maine Chance residential spa in [[Rome, Maine]], the first destination beauty spa in the United States. It operated until 1970.<ref>{{cite news |last=McMillan |first=Susan |url=http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/06/12/former-elizabeth-arden-estate-on-long-pond-for-sale/|title=Former Elizabeth Arden estate on Long Pond for sale |newspaper=[[Kennebec Journal]] |location=[[Augusta, Maine]] |date=June 13, 2014 |access-date=June 13, 2014}}</ref>

In 1962, the French government awarded Arden the [[Légion d'Honneur]], in recognition of her contribution to the cosmetics industry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/elizabeth-arden-1779864|title=Who Was Elizabeth Arden?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=February 27, 2018}}</ref>

Graham.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hannaonline.org/2017/01/30/the-original-beauty-queen-the-story-of-elizabeth-arden/|title=The Original Beauty Queen: The Story of Elizabeth Arden|date=January 30, 2017|work=Hanna|access-date=February 27, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>Wilson, Scott.
