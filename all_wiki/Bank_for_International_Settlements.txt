The BIS carries out its work through its meetings, programmes and through the Basel Process – hosting international groups pursuing global financial stability and facilitating their interaction. It also provides banking services, but only to central banks and other international organizations. It is based in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], with representative offices in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Mexico City]].

== History ==
[[File:Basel - Bank für internationalen Zahlungsausgleich1.jpg|thumb|BIS main building in Basel, Switzerland]]
The BIS was established in 1930 by an [[Treaty|intergovernmental agreement]] between [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]], and [[Switzerland]]. It opened its doors in Basel, Switzerland, on 17 May 1930.<ref>{{Cite web |title=UNTC |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=0800000280167c31 |website=treaties.un.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 January 2005 |title=About the BIS – overview |url=http://www.bis.org/about/index.htm?l=2 |website=www.bis.org}}</ref>

The BIS was originally intended to facilitate [[World War I reparations|reparations imposed on Germany]] by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after [[World War I]], and to act as the trustee for the German Government International Loan ([[Young Plan|Young Loan]]) that was floated in 1930.<ref>BIS History – Overview. BIS website. Retrieved 2011-02-13.</ref> The need to establish a dedicated institution for this purpose was suggested in 1929 by the [[Young Plan|Young Committee]], and was agreed to in August of that year at a conference at [[The Hague]]. The charter for the bank was drafted at the International Bankers Conference at [[Baden-Baden]] in November, and adopted at a second Hague Conference on January 20, 1930. According to the charter, shares in the bank could be held by individuals and non-governmental entities. However, the rights of voting and representation at the Bank's General Meeting were to be exercised exclusively by the central banks of the countries in which shares had been issued. By agreement with Switzerland, the BIS had its corporate existence and headquarters there. It also enjoyed certain immunities in the contracting states (Brussels Protocol 1936).

The BIS's original task of facilitating World War I reparation payments quickly became obsolete. Reparation payments were first suspended ([[Hoover Moratorium|Hoover moratorium]], June 1931) and then abolished altogether (Lausanne Agreement, July 1932). Instead, the BIS focused on its second statutory task, i.e. fostering the cooperation between its member central banks. It acted as a meeting forum for central banks and provided banking facilities to them. For instance, in the late 1930s, the BIS was instrumental in helping continental European central banks shipping out part of their gold reserves to [[London]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 September 1997 |title=Note on gold shipments and gold exchanges organised by the Bank for International Settlements, 1st June 1938 – 31st May 1945 |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/bisp03.htm |website=www.bis.org}}</ref> 

As a purportedly apolitical organisation, the BIS was  unable to prevent transactions that reflected contemporaneous geopolitical realities, but were also widely regarded as unconscionable. As a result of the policy of [[appeasement]] of Nazi Germany by the UK and France, in March 1939, the BIS was obliged to transfer 23 tons of gold it held, on behalf of [[Czechoslovakia]], to the German [[Reichsbank]], following the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German annexation of Czechoslovakia]].<ref>Kubu, E. (1998). "Czechoslovak gold reserves and their surrender to Nazi Germany" In ''Nazi Gold, The London Conference''. London: The Stationery Office, pp. 245–48.</ref>

At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, the BIS Board of Directors – on which the main European central banks were represented – decided that the Bank should remain open, but that, for the duration of hostilities, no meetings of the Board of Directors were to take place and that the Bank should maintain a neutral stance in the conduct of its business. However, as the war dragged on evidence mounted that the BIS conducted operations that were helpful to the Germans. Also, throughout the war, the Allies accused the [[Nazi plunder|Nazis of looting]] and pleaded with the BIS not to accept gold from the Reichsbank in payment for prewar obligations linked to the [[Young Plan]]. This was to no avail as remelted gold was either confiscated from prisoners or seized in victory and thus acceptable as payment to the BIS.<ref>Toniolo, G., ''Central Bank Cooperation at the Bank for International Settlements, 1930-1973'' ([[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]]: 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GLyQ8iIjK3wC&pg=PA245 pp. 245–252].</ref>{{rp|245–252}} Operations conducted by the BIS were viewed with increasing suspicion from London and Washington. The fact that top level German industrialists and advisors sat on the BIS board seemed to provide ample evidence of how the BIS might be used by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] throughout the war, with the help of American, British and French banks. Between 1933 and 1945 the BIS board of directors included [[Walther Funk]], a prominent Nazi official, and [[Emil Puhl]] responsible for processing dental gold looted from concentration camp victims, as well as [[Hermann Schmitz]], the director of [[IG Farben]], and [[Kurt Baron von Schröder|Baron von Schroeder]], the owner of the {{Interlanguage link|J.H. Stein Bank|de||WD=}}, all of whom were later convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Higham |first=Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbKntAEACAAJ |title=Trading with the Enemy: The Nazi-American Money Plot, 1933–1949 |year=1995 |publisher=Barnes & Noble |language=en |author-link=Charles Higham (biographer)}}</ref>

The 1944 [[Bretton Woods Conference]] recommended the "[[liquidation]] of the Bank for International Settlements at the earliest possible moment". This resulted in the BIS being the subject of a disagreement between the U.S. and British delegations. The liquidation of the bank was supported by other European delegates, as well as Americans (including [[Harry Dexter White]] and Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]]).<ref>''United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, Final Act'', Article IV. London, 1944.</ref> Abolition was opposed by [[John Maynard Keynes]], head of the British delegation.

Keynes went to Morgenthau hoping to prevent or postpone the dissolution, but the next day it was approved; the liquidation of the bank was never actually undertaken.<ref>[[Raymond Mikesell|Raymond Frech Mikesell]]. [https://ies.princeton.edu/pdf/E192.pdf ''The Bretton Woods Debates: A Memoir'']. Princeton: International Finance Section, Dept. of Economics, Princeton University. p. 42. {{ISBN|0-88165-099-4}}. Retrieved 8 July 2013. Essays in International Finance 192 brief history of the BIS</ref> In April 1945, the new U.S. president [[Harry S. Truman]] ended U.S. involvement in the scheme. The British government suspended the dissolution and the decision to liquidate the BIS was officially reversed in 1948.<ref>[http://www.bis.org/about/history_2ww2.htm A brief history of the BIS]</ref>

After World War II, the BIS retained a distinct European focus. It acted as Agent for the [[European Payments Union]] (EPU, 1950–58), an intra-European [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] arrangement designed to help the European countries in restoring currency [[convertibility]] and free, multilateral trade.<ref>Kaplan, J. J. and Schleiminger, G. (1989). ''The European Payments Union: Financial Diplomacy in the 1950s''. Oxford: Clarendon Press</ref> During the 1960s – the heyday of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system]] – the BIS once again became the locus for [[Transatlantic relations|transatlantic]] monetary cooperation. It coordinated the central banks' Gold Pool<ref>Toniolo, ''Central Bank Cooperation at the Bank for International Settlements, 1930-1973'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GLyQ8iIjK3wC&pg=PA416 p. 416].</ref>{{rp|416}} and a number of currency support operations (e.g. Sterling Group Arrangements of 1966 and 1968{{cn|date=May 2020}}. The [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten (G10)]], including the main European economies, [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and the United States, became the most prominent grouping.

With the end of the Bretton Woods system (1971–73) and the return to floating exchange rates, financial instability came to the fore. The collapse of some internationally active banks, such as [[Herstatt Bank]] (1974), highlighted the need for improved banking supervision at an international level. The G10 Governors created the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] (BCBS), which remains active. The BIS developed into a global meeting place for regulators and for developing international standards (Basel Concordat, Basel Capital Accord, [[Basel II]] and [[Basel III|III]]). Through its member central banks, the BIS was actively involved in the resolution of the [[Latin American debt crisis]] (1982).

From 1964 until 1993, the BIS provided the secretariat for the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks of the Member States of the European Community (Committee of Governors).<ref>James, H. (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=npEXme7MFCwC&printsec=frontcover ''Making the European Monetary Union, The Role of the Committee of Central Bank Governors and the Origins of the European Central Bank'']. Cambridge-London: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press</ref> This Committee had been created by European Council decision to improve monetary cooperation among the EC central banks. Likewise, the BIS in 1988–89 hosted most of the meetings of the Delors Committee (Committee for the Study of Economic and Monetary Union), which produced a blueprint for monetary unification subsequently adopted in the [[Maastricht Treaty]] (1992). In 1993, when the Committee of Governors was replaced by the European Monetary Institute (EMI – the precursor of the ECB), it moved from Basel to [[Frankfurt]], cutting its ties with the BIS.

In the 1990s–2000s, the BIS successfully globalised, breaking out of its traditional European core. This was reflected in a gradual increase in its membership (from 33 shareholding central bank members in 1995 to 60 in 2013, which together represent roughly 95% of global GDP), and also in the much more global composition of the BIS Board of Directors. In 1998, the BIS opened a Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific in the Hong Kong SAR. A BIS Representative Office for the Americas was established in 2002 in Mexico DF.

The BIS was originally owned by both central banks and private individuals, since the United States, Belgium and France had decided to sell all or some of the shares allocated to their central banks to private investors. BIS shares traded on stock markets, which made the bank an unusual organization: an international organization (in the technical sense of public international law), yet allowed for private shareholders. Many central banks had similarly started as such private institutions; for example, the Bank of England was privately owned until 1946. In more recent years the BIS has bought back its once publicly traded shares.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 June 2005 |title=Press release: BIS completes redistribution of shares |url=http://www.bis.org/press/p050601.htm |website=www.bis.org}}</ref> It is now wholly owned by BIS members (central banks) but still operates in the private market as a counterparty, asset manager and lender for central banks and international financial institutions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 January 2003 |title=Products and services |url=http://www.bis.org/banking/finserv.htm |website=www.bis.org}}</ref> Profits from its transactions are used, among other things, to fund the bank's other international activities.

== Organization of central banks ==
{{Basel II}}
As an organization of central banks, the BIS seeks to make [[monetary policy]] more predictable and transparent among its 60-member central banks, except in the case of Eurozone countries which forfeited the right to conduct monetary policy in order to implement the euro. While monetary policy is determined by most sovereign nations, it is subject to central and private banking scrutiny and potentially to speculation that affects [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] rates and especially the fate of export economies. Failures to keep monetary policy in line with reality and make [[monetary reform]]s in time, preferably as a [[simultaneous policy]] among all 60 member banks and also involving the [[International Monetary Fund]].

Central banks do not unilaterally "set" rates, rather they set goals and intervene using their massive financial resources and regulatory powers to achieve monetary targets they set. One reason to coordinate policy closely is to ensure that this does not become too expensive and that opportunities for private [[arbitrage]] exploiting shifts in policy or difference in policy, are rare and quickly removed.

Two aspects of monetary policy have proven to be particularly sensitive, and the BIS therefore has two specific goals: to regulate [[capital adequacy]] and make [[reserve requirement]]s transparent.

=== Regulates capital adequacy ===
Capital adequacy policy applies to [[Stock|equity]] and [[capital asset]]s. These can be overvalued in many circumstances because they do not always reflect current market conditions or adequately assess the risk of every trading position. Accordingly, the [[Basel III|Basel standards]] require the [[Capital adequacy ratio|capital/asset ratio]] of internationally active commercial banks to be above a prescribed minimum international standard, to improve the resilience of the banking sector.

The main role of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]], hosted by the BIS, is setting capital adequacy requirements. From an international point of view, ensuring capital adequacy is key for central banks, as speculative lending based on inadequate underlying capital and widely varying liability rules causes economic crises as "bad money drives out good" ([[Gresham's Law]]).

=== Encourages reserve transparency ===
Reserve policy is also important, especially to consumers and the domestic economy. To ensure [[liquidity]] and limit [[liability (financial accounting)|liability]] to the larger economy, banks cannot create money in specific industries or regions without limit. To make bank depositing and borrowing safer for customers and reduce risk of [[bank run]]s, banks are required to set aside or "reserve".

Reserve policy is harder to standardize, as it depends on local conditions and is often fine-tuned to make industry-specific or region-specific changes, especially within large [[developing nation]]s. For instance, the [[People's Bank of China]] requires urban banks to hold 7% reserves while letting rural banks continue to hold only 6%, and simultaneously telling all banks that reserve requirements on certain overheated industries would rise sharply or penalties would be laid if investments in them did not stop completely. The PBoC is thus unusual in acting as a [[national bank]], focused on the country and not on the currency, but its desire to control [[asset inflation]] is increasingly shared among BIS members who fear "[[Economic bubble|bubbles]]", and among exporting countries that find it difficult to manage the diverse requirements of the domestic economy, especially rural agriculture, and an export economy, especially in manufactured goods.

Effectively, the PBoC sets different reserve levels for domestic and export styles of development. Historically, the United States also did this, by dividing federal monetary management into nine regions, in which the less-developed western United States had looser policies.

For various reasons it has become quite difficult to accurately assess reserves on more than simple loan instruments, and this plus the regional differences has tended to discourage standardizing any reserve rules at the global BIS scale. Historically, the BIS did set some standards which favoured lending money to private landowners (at about 5 to 1) and for-profit corporations (at about 2 to 1) over loans to individuals. These distinctions reflecting [[classical economics]] were superseded by policies relying on undifferentiated market values – more in line with [[neoclassical economics]].

== Goal: monetary and financial stability ==
The stated mission of the BIS is to serve central banks in their pursuit of monetary and financial stability, to foster international cooperation in those areas and to act as a bank for central banks. The BIS pursues its mission by:
* fostering discussion and facilitating collaboration among central banks;
* supporting dialogue with other authorities that are responsible for promoting financial stability;
* carrying out research and policy analysis on issues of relevance for monetary and financial stability;
* acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; and
* serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations.

The role that the BIS plays today goes beyond its historical role. The original goal of the BIS was "to promote the co-operation of central banks and to provide additional facilities for international financial operations; and to act as trustee or agent in regard to international financial settlements entrusted to it under agreements with the parties concerned", as stated in its Statutes of 1930.<ref>Bank for International Settlements, [http://www.bis.org/about/statutes-en.pdf Statutes], 20 January 1930 (text amended 7 November 2016).</ref>

== Role in banking supervision ==
The BIS hosts the Secretariat of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] and with it has played a central role in establishing the [[Basel Capital Accords]] of 1988, [[Basel II]] framework in 2004 and more recently [[Basel III]] framework.

== Financial results ==
BIS denominates its reserve in IMF [[special drawing rights]]. The balance sheet total of the BIS on 31 March 2019 was SDR 291.1 billion (US$403.7 billion) and a net profit of SDR 461.1 million (US$639.5 million).<ref>BIS, [https://www.bis.org/press/p190630.htm "Time to ignite all engines, BIS says in its Annual Economic Report"], 30 June 2019.</ref>

== Members ==
Sixty-two central banks and monetary authorities are currently members of the BIS and have rights of voting and representation at general meetings. The number of countries represented in each continent are: 35 in [[Europe]], 14 in [[Asia]], 5 in [[South America]], 3 in [[North America]], 2 in [[Oceania]], and 3 in [[Africa]].<ref>Jones, M., [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bis-expansion/bank-for-international-settlements-sees-first-expansion-since-2011-idUSKBN1ZD18Z "Bank for International Settlements sees first expansion since 2011"], [[Reuters]], January 14, 2020.</ref> The 62 members represent the following countries:
