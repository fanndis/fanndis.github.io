"'''Rude Boy'''" is a song by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]], taken from her fourth studio album, ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'' (2009). It was released as the album's fourth overall and third international single on February 19, 2010, through [[The Island Def Jam Music Group|Def Jam]]. Rihanna co-wrote the song with [[Ester Dean]], [[Makeba Riddick]], and producers [[Rob Swire]] and [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]]. "Rude Boy" is an [[up-tempo]] [[dancehall]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song which incorporates elements of [[ragga]]muffin. The song received mixed to positive reviews from critics; some have call it is the highlight of the album, but others criticized Rihanna's "monotone" and "icy" vocal performance.

"Rude Boy" peaked at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for five consecutive weeks and was Rihanna's sixth US number-one single. It was a commercial success globally, peaking at number one in Australia and attained top five positions in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video was directed by [[Melina Matsoukas]], used [[greenscreen]] techniques and featured props that included a stuffed lion and zebra. Rihanna performed the song live for the first time at the Pepsi [[Super Bowl]] Fan Jam in South Beach, Miami, and later on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and ''[[Alan Carr: Chatty Man]]''. "Rude Boy" was also featured on the [[set list]]s of Rihanna's [[Last Girl on Earth]], [[Loud Tour|Loud]], [[Anti World Tour|Anti]] and [[Diamonds World Tour|Diamonds]] tours.

==Background and development==
"Rude Boy" was produced by Rob Swire and [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]] who co-wrote the song with Rihanna, [[Ester Dean]], and [[Makeba Riddick]].<ref name="About.com">{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Bill|url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/rihannarudeboy.htm|title=Rihanna &ndash; Rude Boy &ndash; Review of Rude Boy Single By Rihanna &ndash; About.com |publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref> During an interview on the television show, ''[[Alan Carr: Chatty Man]]'' in February 2010, Carr asked Rihanna about the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line "Come here rude boy, boy, can you get it up?/Come here rude boy, boy, is you big enough?"<ref name="AlanCarrInterview">{{Cite episode |title=Alan Carr: Chatty Man |series= 3|series-link=Alan Carr: Chatty Man#Series 3 |credits=[[Alan Carr]] |network=[[Channel 4]] |station=Channel 4 |airdate=2010-02-25 |season=3 |number=4 |minutes=40:00}}</ref> Rihanna explained: "When we wrote the song, it was kind of a freestyle&nbsp;...&nbsp;I liked the West Indian influence that the music had, and, I just went in the booth, they were already jotting down some ideas and, that came to me, I just ran in there with the, one of the writers and started coming up with this in the studio and now when people read it back to me like that, 'Come here rude boy, is you big enough'?, it does sound so disgusting!" She also explained the development of the song, and said that those lyrics were originally going to be the [[Introduction (music)|introduction]], but because of the song's infectious beat, Rihanna decided to make it the [[Hook (music)|hook]] instead.<ref name="AlanCarrInterview"/>

In an interview with ''[[Us Weekly]]'', Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about the inspiration for the song. Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: "I was listening to the words and me and [Rihanna] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics &ndash; surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song."<ref name="Riddick">{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/moviestvmusic/news/meet-the-music-producer-behind-rihannas-hit-rude-boy-2010293|title=Meet the Songwriter Behind Rihanna's Hit 'Rude Boy'|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=2010-03-29|accessdate=2011-09-29}}</ref> Dean explained the development of "Rude Boy" in an interview with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares&nbsp;...&nbsp;that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what people want to do, but are afraid to do."<ref name="TheBoomBox">{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Keith|url=http://www.theboombox.com/2011/01/19/rude-boy-writer-ester-dean-on-penning-hits-for-rihanna-usher/|title='Rude Boy' writer Ester Dean on penning for Rihanna, Usher|publisher=The Boom Box|date=2011-01-19|accessdate=2011-09-29}}</ref> In an interview with [[Entertainment Weekly]], Stargate revealed that Rihanna had come up with the title and concept for the song herself, and communicated her ideas to Dean before any work began on the music.<ref>[http://ew.com/music/2018/04/09/stargate-producers-rihanna-katy-perry-beyonce/ Producer duo Stargate share the secrets behind their Rihanna, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé hits] [[Entertainment Weekly]]. 2018-04-09.

==Critical reception==
''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}} reviewer [[Ann Powers]] stated that the song has a "ragamuffin-style", and commented on the lyrics, "Even as she offers herself in no uncertain terms&mdash;'I'm gon' let you be the captain tonight' she sneers&mdash;she questions his prowess. 'Can you get it up? Are you big enough?' she repeats in the singsong chorus, making it tough to imagine that any suitor could rise to this occasion."<ref name="Powers"/> Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] praised the song, and called it "the most instantly engaging song from the album Rated R", and that "[Rihanna] projects a dominant female image that is exactly what was needed to move past the unfortunate [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]] chapter in her career". However, Lamb added that the "icy feel is wearing thin. Rihanna sounds like she has taken a few steps back to distance herself from the whole song. There is a pleasing swagger, but we're never quite engaged".<ref name="About.com"/>

Nick Levine of [[Digital Spy]], commenting on the genre of the song and Rihanna's musical direction and transition from her previous album ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad (Rihanna album)|Good Girl Gone Bad]]'' (2007), wrote that the song "can be construed as a winning synthesis of her Island-pop beginnings, the effortless hitmaking of the ''Good Girl Gone Bad'' era and the more menacing persona she's unveiled post-Grammygate. On the other, it's just a damn good tune." Levine also wrote that "Rude Boy" is "the most instantly catchy moment" on ''Rated R''.<ref name="Nick Levine"/> Alibhe Malone of ''[[NME]]'' commented on the song's demeanor in relation to ''Rated R'' as a whole, and wrote, "With only one other female songwriter here apart from Rihanna (Ester Dean on 'Rude Boy') it's a startlingly masculine record – in sound and in attitude."<ref name="AlibheMalone">{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Alibhe|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/rihanna/10985|title=Album review: Rihanna &ndash; 'Rated R' (Mercury) |work=[[NME]]|date=2009-12-03|accessdate=2011-09-23}}</ref> Malone also wrote that Rihanna persists in ensuring that listener realizes "how she wants men in her bed."<ref name="AlibheMalone"/> Ryan Dombell of [[Pitchfork Media]] wrote a mixed review of the song; he called it the flightiest song on ''Rated R'', but praised it as superior to the riskier material on the album.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dombell|first=Ryan|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13740-rated-r/|title=Rihanna Rated R|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|publisher=Ryan Schreiber|date=2009-12-03|accessdate=2011-09-23}}</ref>

(artist)|M.I.A.]]'s video  "[[Boyz (song)|Boyz]]".<ref name="M.I.A"/><ref name="Chris Ryan">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Chris|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2010/02/12/new-video-rihanna-rude-boy/|title=New Video: Rihanna, 'Rude Boy'|publisher=MTV|date=2010-02-12|accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref> Melina Matsoukas responded to the allegations that she had copied the idea, and said, "Afterward I was like, 'Oh, this sucks. They tore down my video&nbsp;...&nbsp;[M.I.A.'s] video's great too. It definitely wasn't trying to rip anybody off at all, it was just our approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." Matsoukas explained that the inspiration for the video did not come from one particular source, but from a variety of pop culture icons. She concluded, "We're all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way."<ref name="M.I.A"/> Several critics noticed the differences between Rihanna's previous singles, "Russian Roulette" and "Hard", and that "Rude Boy" had adopted a care-free and brighter image. Becky Bain of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] also noticed the similarities between M.I.A.'s video "Boyz" and "Rude Boy", and wrote, "We're digging the reggae-inflected jam, although the Bob Marley-meets-M.I.A. color explosion becomes a little hard on the eyes after awhile." Bain said the video "is colorful, loud, vibrant, and a complete departure from the mostly depressing captivity scenarios and over-the-top war imagery of the previous videos from her Rated R singles."<ref name="Bain">{{cite web|last=Bain|first=becky|url=http://idolator.com/5403752/rihannas-rude-boy-video-politely-uses-every-color-of-the-rainbow|title=Rihanna's 'Rude Boy' Video Politely Uses Every Color Of The Rainbow|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|date=2010-02-10|accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref> Simon Vozick-Levinson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' also commented on the vibrancy of the video and its resemblance to M.I.A.'s video, "It's a wild explosion of clashing colors, bold block lettering, and shaky camerawork. As many observers instantly pointed out, it all owes more than a little to the aesthetic of M.I.A.&mdash;which, if you ask me, is not a bad thing at all."<ref>{{cite news|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/02/11/rihanna-rude-boy-video/|title=Rihanna throws a crazy, colorful party in her 'Rude Boy' video: Watch it here|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] division of [[Time Warner]]|date=2010-02-11|accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref> Jocelyn Vena of [[MTV]] commented on the change of visual direction in the video, calling it "a colorful departure from the dark fare previously released from her Rated R album." Vena also wrote about the stylization of the video's content with regard to Rihanna's heritage. She wrote that the video is infused with "a kaleidoscope of prints and colors, embracing her roots in Caribbean dance-hall-inspired costumes."<ref name="truecolors"/>
