'''''Duet''''' is an American [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] that aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] from April 19, 1987 to August 20, 1989. Originally, the story centered on the romance of a novelist ([[Matthew Laurance]]) and a caterer ([[Mary Page Keller]]), but gradually the focus shifted to their [[yuppie]] friends ([[Chris Lemmon]], [[Alison LaPlaca]]) and the show was [[Rebranding|rebranded]] as ''[[Open House (1989 TV series)|Open House]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Duet Turns Into Open House|url=https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/zUIAAOSwcjRbR3wA/s-l1600.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200706222336/https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/zUIAAOSwcjRbR3wA/s-l1600.jpg|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-07-06|author=Jerry Buck|website=|publisher=St. Louis Post Dispatch|date=August 27, 1989 |quote=It's not really a new show. ''Duet'' has been revamped and has been given the new name ''Open House'' and a largely new cast.}}</ref> The series was created by Ruth Bennett and Susan Seeger, and was produced by [[Paramount Television]].

==Synopsis==
Ben is a struggling mystery novelist, while his girlfriend Laura is a caterer with her younger sister Jane ([[Jodi Thelen]]). Richard and Linda were a high-powered [[yuppie]] couple. He was in the family patio-furniture business and she was a studio executive. Linda's boss at World Wide Studios was Cooper Hayden ([[Larry Poindexter]]), who eventually became infatuated with Jane. Richard later quit his job to become a professional pianist. Geneva ([[Arleen Sorkin]]) was the Phillips' wisecracking, sexy maid who sometimes fraternized with the sisters.

In the 1987-88 season finale, Linda gave birth to a daughter, Amanda, who grew into a three-year-old (Ginger Orsi) capable of speech by the start of the series' third and final season. When the 1988-89 season began, Ben and Laura had married, and Linda had lost her job at World Wide Studios. Linda then sought a partnership in Laura's catering business. Just prior to the end of that season, Linda met real estate mogul Ted Nichols, played by guest star and LaPlaca's then-boyfriend, [[Philip Charles MacKenzie]]. Ted schmoozed her into joining his realty firm, selling upscale properties to snobs just like herself. Shortly after, Fox announced its cancellation of ''Duet'', and with LaPlaca as its breakout star, both she and MacKenzie shared the lead in its [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''[[Open House (1989 TV series)|Open House]]''.

==Production==
The series was among the first to appear on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX network]] when they launched a Sunday night [[prime-time]] TV lineup in 1987, alongside ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' and ''[[Mr. President (TV series)|Mr. President]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Duet (TV ) |url=http://greatbutforgotten.blogspot.com/2014/06/duet-tv.html|author=Chuck Rothman|website=Great But Forgotten|publisher=|date=2014-06-29 |quote=It was extremely difficult it to set up a fourth broadcast TV network... And ''Duet'' was one of the shows that they based their original Sunday schedule on.

[[Matthew Laurance]] was the first actor hired, but they couldn't find a leading lady that sparked with him in Los Angeles, so they held auditions in New York, where they finally found [[Mary Page Keller]].<ref>{{cite web|title= 'Duet' actor finds link between character, his own personality |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/163135572/ |author=Lane Crockett|website=|publisher=The Journal News|date=1987-04-10 |quote=Matthew Laurance was hired for "Duet" before Keller.

Although the first season focused squarely on Ben and Laura, season two became an ensemble with ongoing stories revolving around Jane, Richard, and Linda. As the meaning of the show's title blurred, Fox tried to spin it in promotion claiming, "''Duet means two, so why is it about five people, a dog, and a baby? Because it's a show you shouldn't watch alone!''"<ref>{{cite web|title=WOIO The Fall Guy Break April 11 1988 Part 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2xEqy5Nl1M|website=YouTube|publisher=|date= |quote=}}</ref> By the third season, Fox executives began forcing changes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chris Lemmon Plays New Key|url=https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/zUIAAOSwcjRbR3wA/s-l1600.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200706222336/https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/zUIAAOSwcjRbR3wA/s-l1600.jpg|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-07-06|author=Jerry Buck|website=|publisher=St. Louis Post Dispatch|date=August 27, 1989 |quote="I think they changed the show because Fox stepped in and ordered a change," Lemmon said.}}</ref>  Noticing the popularity of Alison LaPlaca's character, they pushed Ben, Laura, and Jane into the background<ref>{{cite book |author=Alex McNeil|title=Total Television |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Books|page=241 |date=1996 |isbn= |quote=After Ben and Laura's return, however, little was seen of them as the episodes focused increasingly on the Phillipses, particularly on Linda, whose delightfully bitchy character had become popular with viewers.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Tim Brooks (historian)|Tim Brooks]] & Earle Marsh|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present]]|url= |location= |publisher=Random House |page=341 |date=2003 |isbn= |quote=As the season progressed, the focus shifted more and more to stories about Linda and, when ''Duet'' was canceled, she became the star of ''Open House'', the spin-off series that replaced it in the Fox lineup.}}</ref> as stories became exclusively centered on Linda and Richard.

The theme music over the opening titles was composed by Buddy Budson, and in the first two seasons performed by Ursula Walker and Tony Franklin.

Beginning in season two, the opening titles changed to begin featuring clips of the characters in scenes from the show. These were book-ended by the show's title appearing in gold on a maroon leather-textured [[photo album]] cover, which opened to reveal the series of episode clips, and the photo album closing, with creators Ruth Bennett and Susan Seeger being credited in gold on the album cover. (In season one, the show title was displayed over the beginning of the opening scene.) In season three, the same sequence style remained, but the theme music was rearranged into a complete [[synthesizer]]/[[electric guitar]] instrumental, with the guitar taking the place of the notes sung by [[vocalist]]s Walker and Franklin.
