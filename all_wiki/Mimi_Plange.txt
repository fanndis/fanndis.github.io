In an interview with the NYTimes, Plange states, "I want to prove to people that African fashion can't be pigeonholed," she said. "I can compete globally." Plange doesn't use traditional African prints or textiles in her designs. In her Spring 2012 collection, Scarred Perfection, she referenced the body scars that Africans would use as a mode of tribal identification. Plange explains, "I am motivated by those things that make us question how we represent ourselves to other people."<ref name=Oliver2011>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/fashion/africas-new-fashion-influence.html|title=Africa's New Fashion Influence|last=Oliver|first=Simone S.|date=2011-12-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-08|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=Jennings2011 />
