Between 1995 and 1998, Serwer was a senior writer at ''Fortune''. In 1997, he gained attention for writing an online column, then a novelty, called "Street Life" about the personalities and stories on [[Wall Street]]. "Achaea had Homer, the Spanish Civil War had Hemingway, California had the Beach Boys, and now our hyperactive stock market has its own poet-singerâ€”Andy Serwer," James Collins wrote in the May 22, 2000, issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Financial Voice as Wild as the Market |first=James |last=Collins |magazine=The New Yorker |date=May 22, 2000 |url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?iid=15428&startpage=page0000033#folio=030 |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref> The column later evolved into "Captain's Blog."<ref>{{cite news |title=Captain's Blog |first=Andrew |last=Serwer |website=Fortune.com |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/captainsblog/ |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref>

He has written a number of ''Fortune'' cover stories, including profiles of Microsoft co-founder [[Bill Gates]], Oracle co-founder [[Larry Ellison]], and Cisco CEO [[John Chambers (CEO)|John Chambers]]. In 2000, NewsBios named Serwer Business Journalist of the Year, calling him "perhaps the nation's top multimedia talent, successfully juggling the roles of serious journalist, astute commentator and occasional court jester."

Serwer was a regular contributor on [[CNN]]'s "American Morning" and served as a co-host of CNN's "In The Money." He has also appeared on ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'', NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' and has written for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', ''[[Politico]],'' and ''[[SLAM Magazine]]''.

Serwer was named managing editor of ''Fortune'' in November 2006, replacing Eric Pooley.  In August 2014, Serwer left the company when executives appointed Alan Murray as the new top editor.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/business/media/fortune-names-alan-murray-top-editor.html?_r=0 |title=Fortune Names Alan Murray Top Editor |first=Ravi |last=Somaiya |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=22 July 2014 |page=B3}}</ref>
