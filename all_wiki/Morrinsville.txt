==History and Culture==

===Pre-European settlement===

Prior to European settlement of New Zealand, the hills around present-day Morrinsville were occupied  by the Ngati Werewere [[Māori people]] of the Ngati Haua [[Iwi]], and the site of the present-day town was on or near to an old Māori route between the upper Waihou-Piako basin and the [[Ngāruawāhia]] area.<ref name="MorrinsvilleHistory_2"/>

Following European settlement, some early European [[Merchant|traders]] are believed to have traversed this route prior to 1834 when the Rev. J. Morgan travelled up the [[Piako River]] to near the future town site and crossed west to Horotiu, near Ngāruawāhia.<ref name="MorrinsvilleHistory_1"/> First recorded contact with European settlers occurred around 1850, with John Johnson trading with the Māori from 1852.<ref name="MorrinsvilleHistory_3"/>

===Post-European settlement===

The 1860s saw an influx of European settlers to the area between [[Te Aroha]] and [[Matamata]], and on 13 December 1873 a settler from [[Auckland]], Thomas  Morrin,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/account/3016/object/520|title=Land Title; 1876; 7042 - Morrinsville Museum on NZMuseums|website=www.nzmuseums.co.nz|access-date=2016-03-02}}</ref> purchased the Kuranui No.1 Block from the local Māori and founded the Lockerbie Estate, which Morrin named after the [[Lockerbie|Scottish town]] from which his father had emigrated. In May 1874, Morrin purchased two further blocks,  Motumaoho No.1 and No.2, and his estate then totaled over {{convert|30,000|acre|hectare}}. The fledgling village was to be the service centre for Morrin's Lockerbie Estate and he built a blacksmith's shop, manager's house, the Jolly Cripple Hotel and general store and donated land for a school. Morrin hired Irish [[navvy|navvies]] from the gold fields to dig a network of ditches to drain the land, enabling it to be used for agriculture. In 1882 Morrin surveyed the land for the site of the town proper, and deposited plans for ten streets:  Anderson, Hamilton, Studholme, Moorhouse, Lorne, Canada, Cureton, Somerville, Thames and Thorpe (the first and last three streets being named after family members).<ref name="MorrinsvilleHistory_2"/><ref name="MorrinsvilleHistory_1"/><ref name="MorrinsvilleHistory_3"/>

The Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company began construction of a railway line from Morrinsville to [[Rotorua]] in 1879, and on 1 October 1884, the line from [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] to Morrinsville was opened. With construction progressing towards [[Paeroa]] and the line to [[Te Aroha]] opening on 1 March 1886, the town's population was listed as 633 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mpdc.govt.nz/history/morrinsville-history|title=Morrinsville|website=Matamata Piako District Council|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref> With further expansion of the railway towards [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]] and [[Tauranga]], alongside extensive drainage of swamp land to the south and west of the town making available large areas for dairy farming, Morrinsville was declared a town district in 1908 and in 1921 was constituted as a borough.<ref name="MorrinsvilleHistory_1"/>

===Marae===

Morrinsville has two [[marae]]: Kai a Te Mata and its meeting house Wairere, and Rukumoana or Top Pā and its meeting house Werewere.<ref name="maorimaps">{{cite web |title=Māori Maps |url=https://maorimaps.com/map |website=maorimaps.com |publisher=Te Potiki National Trust}}</ref> Both marae are affiliated with the [[Ngāti Hauā]] iwi and its [[Ngāti Werewere]] hapū, and with the [[Waikato Tainui]] iwi.<ref name="tkmentry">{{cite web|title=Te Kāhui Māngai directory|url= http://www.tkm.govt.nz/ |website=tkm.govt.nz|publisher=[[Te Puni Kōkiri]]}}</ref>

In October 2020, the Government committed $734,311 from the [[Provincial Growth Fund]] to upgrade both marae and 3 other Ngāti Hauā marae, creating 7 jobs.<ref name="maraepgf">{{cite web |title=Marae Announcements |url=https://www.growregions.govt.nz/assets/funding-announcements/marae-announcements.xlsx |website=growregions.govt.nz |publisher=[[Provincial Growth Fund]] |format=Excel |date=9 October 2020}}</ref>

==Commerce==
Morrinsville is one of three towns, along with [[Te Aroha]] and [[Matamata]], that serves one of New Zealand's most prosperous [[dairy farming]] areas.

Dairy processing has been a notable industry in Morrinsville, most notably through the Morrinsville Dairy Company since 1922.  The dairy company retained the Scottish link through prominently using the name Lockerbie. Today, after a series of mergers, the dairy factory is now operated by the [[Fonterra]] Dairy Co-operative. The factory processes 1.2 million litres of milk per day during the peak of the milk production season, producing milk powders, cream, butter and canned butter for tropical countries where refrigeration is not always available.

During the late 1920s a company was formed to develop the flax industry on the extensive low-lying areas west of Morrinsville. Several thousand acres were acquired for the planting and milling of [[Phormium tenax|New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax)]], but prevailing  economic conditions forced the early abandonment of the project.  Most of this land has reverted to dairy farming or fat-lamb production, and the original English grasses used by earlier settlers have been replaced with higher producing Italian ryegrass and nitrogen-fixing white clover. During the town's formative years the area also contained a number of commercial sawmills, most of which closed by the 1930s as land was cleared for farming. Meadow Mushrooms, one of Morrinsville's biggest employers, ceased its local operations and relocated to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] in 2010, with the subsequent loss of around 160 jobs.<ref name="NZHeradNews"/>

As a service centre for the local dairy industry, many of Morrinsville's businesses are geared towards supporting this industry and associated rural activities, and today the town is still home to large stockyards and regular livestock markets.  There is also a chemical plant producing hydrogen peroxide, fertiliser and other agri-nutrients located on the southern outskirts of the town.

==Transportation==

===Railway===

Historically, Morrinsville was the railway junction of the Auckland–Thames and Auckland–Rotorua lines, which subsequently became the [[Thames Branch]] and the [[East Coast Main Trunk Railway]] ([[Tauranga]]) lines.  Morrinsville Railway Station was opened on 1 October 1884, to the east off Studholme Street, at the junction of the two lines. A footbridge over the track was opened in 1913, connecting the station with the town from the end of Canada Street.<ref name="MorrinsvilleHistory_6"/> The station was described as consisting of "two asphalt passenger platforms, and the station buildings contain a ladies' waiting room, a large general waiting room, a post office lobby with post and telegraph offices, a ticket office, and offices for the Inspector of Permanent Way. There are also large goods and engine sheds, and cattle loading yards. Five workmen's cottages adjoin the station, and the Bank of New Zealand Estates Company has a large building connected with the siding for seed-cleaning and storage purposes."<ref name="MorrinsvilleHistory_5"/> The station was moved about {{Convert|1/4|mi||abbr=}} towards Hamilton in 1923.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WAIKIN19230927.2.8|title=LOCAL AND GENERAL. WAIKATO INDEPENDENT|date=27 Sep 1923|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref> The original station building was demolished in 1984 and a smaller building was erected approximately 300 metres to the west off Marshall Street, which is still used by [[KiwiRail]] for freight services.

[[File:Morrinsville Railway Station, 1902.jpg|thumb|Morrinsville railway station, 1902]]

Passenger services are no longer provided to or from Morrinsville Railway Station.  The [[Thames Branch]] closed on 28 June 1991 and the track subsequently lifted, although in 2004 a short shunt line – the Waitoa Industrial Line – reopened to facilitate freight trains for the Waitoa Dairy Factory. The [[East Coast Main Trunk Railway]] provided passenger services between [[Auckland]] and [[Rotorua]] – the [[Geyserland Express]] – and [[Auckland]] and [[Tauranga]] - the [[Kaimai Express]]; however, in 2001 it was announced that these services were too uneconomic to continue, and the last trains ran on 7 October 2001.

Passenger traffic reached a peak in 1944, as shown in this table and the graph -
