'''Human rights in the United Kingdom''' concern the fundamental rights in [[law]] of every person in the [[United Kingdom]]. An integral part of the [[United Kingdom constitutional law|UK constitution]], human rights derive from [[common law]], from [[statute]]s such as [[Magna Carta]], the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] and the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], from membership of the Council of Europe, and from [[international law]]. Codification of [[human rights]] is recent, but the UK law had one of the world's longest human rights traditions. Today the main source of jurisprudence is the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which incorporated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] into domestic litigation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The UK and the European Court of Human Rights|url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/documents/research/83._european_court_of_human_rights.pdf|publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=Spring 2012|page=9}}</ref><ref>The United Kingdom consists of four countries and three distinct legal systems: [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]: {{cite web|title=A Guide to the UK Legal System|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/United_Kingdom.html|publisher=Hauser Global Law School Program, New York University School of Law|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=November 2005}} and {{cite web|title=The Legal System of the United Kingdom|url=http://www.cilex.org.uk/about_cilex_lawyers/the_uk_legal_system.aspx|publisher=The Chartered Institute of Legal Executives|accessdate=16 March 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313232551/http://www.cilex.org.uk/about_cilex_lawyers/the_uk_legal_system.aspx|archive-date=13 March 2016}}.

Codification of [[human rights]] is recent, but before the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], UK law had one of the world's longest human rights traditions. The [[Magna Carta 1215]] bound the King to require Parliament's consent before any tax, respect the right to a trial "by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land", stated that "We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right", guaranteed [[Freedom of movement|free movement]] for people, and preserved [[common land]] for everyone.<ref>[[Magna Carta 1215]] clauses 12 (no tax without consent), 39 (fair trial), 40 (justice), 41 (free movement of merchants), and 47 (disafforesting common land).</ref> It implicitly supported what became the writ of [[habeas corpus]], safeguarding individual freedom against [[False imprisonment|unlawful imprisonment]] with right to [[appeal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/21magnacarta.html|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> After the [[Simon de Montfort's Parliament|first representative English parliament]] in 1265, the emergence of [[Parliament of England#The emergence of parliament as an institution|petitioning]] in the 13th century is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/citizen_subject/origins.htm |title=Origins and growth of Parliament |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/magna-carta-and-contemporary-constitutional-change|title=Magna Carta and contemporary constitutional change|last=Blick|first=Andrew|date=13 March 2015|website=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|access-date=21 July 2016}}</ref>

During the early 17th century, the [[Petition of Right 1628]] reasserted the values of the Magna Carta against [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The idea of freely debating rights to political representation took form during the [[Putney Debates]] of 1647. After the [[English Civil War]] the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] in England and Wales, and the [[Claim of Rights Act 1689]] in Scotland, enshrined principles of representative democracy, no tax without Parliament, freedom of speech in Parliament, and no "cruel and unusual punishment". Philosophers began to think of rights not as privileges to be granted by the government or the law, but as a fundamental part of what it means to be a person.<ref>{{cite web|title=Human Rights|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritemshumanrights.html|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> [[John Locke]] (1632–1704), one of the most influential of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, argued that protection of "property" – which to him meant "life, liberty and estates" – were the very reasons that society existed. He articulated that every person is created equal and free but, in return for the advantages of living in an organised society, a person may need to give up some of this freedom.<ref>{{cite web|title=Locke's Two Treatises| url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/62johnlocketreatise.html| publisher=The British Library|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

During the 18th century, the landmark case of ''[[Entick v Carrington]]'', following Locke almost exactly, established that the state and government could do nothing that is not expressly provided for by law, and that people could do anything but that which is prohibited by law.<ref>cf {{harvp|Pannick|Lester|2004|loc=para. 1.02}} and Feldman (2002) 70 criticising the "undifferentiated mass of liberty".</ref> In ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'',<ref>(1772) 98 ER 499</ref> Lord Mansfield held that slavery was unlawful at common law so that a person who had purportedly been enslaved in Boston, Massachusetts had to be freed in England. This was a severe grievance of southern colonies in the run up to the [[US Declaration of Independence]].<ref>AW Blumrosen, 'The Profound Influence in America of Lord Mansfield's Decision in Somerset v Stuart' (2007) 13 Texas Wesleyan Law Review 645</ref> By 1789, ideas of inherent rights had evolved and inspired both the [[US Bill of Rights]], and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] after the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s. Although some labelled natural rights as "nonsense upon stilts",<ref>[[J Bentham]], ''Anarchical Fallacies; Being an Examination of the Declarations of Rights Issued During the French Revolution'' (1789) [https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/1921#Bentham_0872-02_6149 art II]</ref> more legal rights were slowly developed by Parliament and the courts. In 1792, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] began the British movement for women's rights and equality,<ref>[[Mary Wollstonecraft|M Wollstonecraft]], ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects]]'' (1792). See also [[Olympe de Gouges|O de Gouges]], ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen]]'' (1791)</ref> while movements behind the [[Tolpuddle martyrs]] and the [[Chartists]] drove reform for labour and democratic freedom.<ref>Turning points were the [[Second Reform Act 1867]] and the [[Trade Union Act 1871]].</ref>

Upon the catastrophe of [[World War Two]] and the [[Holocaust]], the new [[international law]] order put the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948]] at its centre, enshrining civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Though a UN General Assembly Declaration, not a treaty, the rights are binding ''[[jus cogens]]'' norms in international law, and the UK ratified two further treaties which recast the Universal Declaration: the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] of 1966. In 1950, the UK co-authored the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], enabling people to appeal to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] even against Acts of Parliament: Parliament has always undertaken to comply with basic principles of [[international law]].<ref>This is qualified, as in the [[EU]], by the position that international law must be compatible with basic principles of the UK constitution: see ''[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'' [2014] UKSC 3 (for the UK), ''[[Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission]]'' (2008) C-402/05 (for the EU) and ''[[Re Wünsche Handelsgesellschaft]]'' (22 October 1986) BVerfGE 73, 339 (first setting out the basic concepts).</ref> Because this appeals process was long, Parliament legislated to "bring rights home" with the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], so that people can raise human rights claims in UK courts based on the [[ECHR|Convention]] directly. The [[ECHR|Convention]] contains the rights to life, rights against torture, against forced labour, to marry, to an effective remedy, and the right to suffer no discrimination in those rights.<ref>[[ECHR]] arts 2 (right to life). Article 3 (right against torture). Article 4, right against forced labour, see ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'' (1772) 98 ER 499. Articles 12-14 are the right to marriage, effectiveness and to equal treatment.</ref> Most case law concerns the rights to [[liberty]], [[privacy]], [[freedom of conscience]] and [[freedom of expression|expression]], and to [[freedom of association]] and assembly.<ref>[[ECHR]] arts 5-11.</ref> The UK also enshrines rights to fair labour standards, social security, and a multitude of [[social and economic rights]] through its legislation.

In May 2019, the British government announced to appoint its first human rights ambassador. Foreign Secretary [[Jeremy Hunt]] appointed Rita French, Hunt's former principal private secretary, to promote UK's work at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] and internationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/20/uk-appoint-first-human-rights-ambassador-rita-french|title=UK to appoint first human rights ambassador|work=The Guardian|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>

==European Convention on Human Rights==
{{Main|European Convention on Human Rights}}
The UK played an important role in the drafting of the Convention,{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 1.59}} with figures such as [[Arthur Lehman Goodhart|Arthur Goodhart]], [[John Foster (UK politician)|John Foster]] and the UK-based [[Hersch Lauterpacht]] providing the impetus for the creation of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1949 as a means of guarding against the rise of new [[dictatorship]]s and to provide the citizens of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-occupied countries with a beacon of hope.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The initiative in producing a legally binding human rights agreement had already been taken by the International Council of the [[European Movement]], an organisation whose cause had been championed by [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harold Macmillan]], and whose international juridical section (counting Lauterpacht and [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|Maxwell Fyfe]] amongst its members) had produced a draft convention.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Chaired by Maxwell Fyfe and the former [[French Resistance]] leader [[Pierre-Henri Teitgen]], the Legal Committee of the Council of Europe's Consultative Assembly proposed that the Council's Committee of Ministers draw up a convention which would take in and ensure the effective enjoyment of the rights proclaimed in the [[United Nations]]' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] of 10 December 1948, as well as establishing a [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court and Commission of Human Rights]]. The Committee agreed and the text of what was to become the European Convention of Human Rights was in the main drafted by Sir Oscar Dowson, a retired senior legal adviser to the [[Home Office]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 1.47}}

===Ratification===
There was reluctant support for the Convention back in the UK where [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]]'s [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] were in power.{{sfnp|Feldman|2002|p=72}} The [[Lord Chancellor]] [[William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt|Jowitt]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Jim Griffiths|Griffiths]] and the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] disapproved of ratification on the basis of the loss of sovereignty that would result.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|pp=444-445}} Jowitt also saw a threat to the domestic system of common law and the risk in allowing judgments to be made by an unknown foreign court.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|p=445}} He nevertheless believed that ratification was necessary from a political point of view as a refusal would be, in his view, difficult to justify at home and abroad.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|p=446}} Political pressure aside, the overall government view was that the Convention was only aimed at preventing a totalitarian takeover and not human rights issues within a functioning democracy.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|p=447}} In essence, it was thought that Britain had little to lose from ratification but rejection could risk some loss of face in Europe.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|p=447}} The Convention had more support among Conservative party politicians, in particular Winston Churchill who believed that it could help unify Europe on the basis of the rule of law.{{sfnp|Bogdanor|2009|p=57}}

The UK became the first state to deposit its instrument of ratification of the Convention on 8 March 1951,{{sfnp|Fenwick|2007|p=141}} with the Convention taking effect on 3 September 1953 after the tenth ratification was deposited.{{sfnp|Marston|1993|p=796}}{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 1.47}} No legislation was introduced and no steps were taken to give effect to the Convention's rights in domestic law until the passing of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.05}}

===Right of petition===
Two aspects of the Convention gave the United Kingdom's representatives to the Council of Europe cause for concern: the establishment of a [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the right of individual petition to the Court.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|p=448}} It was thought that the possibility to submit complaints was open to abuse and could be used for political purposes, notably by members of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]], rather than for genuine grievances.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|p=448}} In addition, it was feared that the consequences of accepting individual petition would be to cause instability in the [[Crown colony|British colonies]] as Britain's authority could be undermined.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|pp=448-449}} Britain's attempts to exclude the provisions relating to these two issues were unsuccessful but it managed to ensure that they were optional.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|p=451}}

The [[Third Churchill ministry|Conservative government]] [[1951 United Kingdom general election|elected in 1951]] ratified the First Protocol to the ECHR in 1953 relating to the rights to property, education and free elections,{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.18}} but resisted the right of petition on the grounds that the [[common law]] would come under scrutiny by an [[international court]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Labour's [[1964 United Kingdom general election|election in 1964]] led to reconsideration of the issue and this time the only senior dissenting voice was that of the [[Home Secretary]], [[Frank Soskice, Baron Stow Hill|Frank Soskice]].{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|p=452}} Although willing to accept the right of petition, he objected to the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court on the basis that it would deprive the United Kingdom of a degree of flexibility in dealing with petitions and could lead to political embarrassment.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|pp=452-453}} Nonetheless, by 1965 a majority of government ministers believed that the Court would not pose a significantly greater threat to [[Westphalian sovereignty|national sovereignty]] or to political survival than the [[European Commission of Human Rights|Commission of Human Rights]] to which the United Kingdom was subject.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|p=453}} Further pressure for acceptance came from the British judge and President of the Court, [[Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair]], the [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe]] [[Peter Smithers]], [[Terence Higgins, Baron Higgins|Terence Higgins MP]] and various non-governmental organisations.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|pp=453-454}}{{sfnp|Lester|1998|p=239}}

As had been the case for ratification in 1950, the Labour government concluded in 1965 that there was little to be lost from giving in to the pressure to recognise the Court and the right of petition.{{sfnp|Wicks|2000|p=454}} In December 1965, Wilson informed the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that the right of petition would be recognised for an initial period of three years.{{sfnp|Lester|1998|p=251}} At the time the government were concerned that the [[Burmah Oil Company]] would take advantage of the new right to contest the legality of the [[War Damage Act 1965]] depriving the company of the right to compensation for damage caused during [[World War II]] as recognised by [[Burmah Oil Co. v Lord Advocate|a House of Lords' decision]], the acceptance was timed to fall outside the six-month [[Statute of limitations|limitation period]] for challenges to the Act and the United Kingdom's acceptance also explicitly stated that it applied only to claims arising after its effective date.{{sfnp|Lester|1998|p=252}}{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 1.48}} The declarations of acceptance were deposited by [[Robert Boothby, Baron Boothby|Robert Boothby MP]] with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on 14 January 1966.{{sfnp|Lester|1998|p=253}}

===Campaign for incorporation===
The first public call for the [[Incorporation of international law|incorporation]] of the Convention into national law was made in 1968 by [[Anthony Lester, Baron Lester of Herne Hill|Anthony Lester]] who published a pamphlet entitled ''Democracy and Individual Rights''.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.19}} Then in 1974 [[Leslie Scarman, Baron Scarman|Lord Scarman]] called for an [[Entrenched clause|entrenched]] instrument to challenge the sovereignty of Parliament and protect basic human rights.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.19}}{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 1.50}} The following year a Charter of Human Rights was unveiled by the Labour Party [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|National Executive Committee]], although this was regarded as insufficient by certain Conservative politicians including [[Leon Brittan]], [[Geoffrey Howe]] and [[Roy Jenkins]] who saw an entrenched Bill of Rights as more effective in preventing abuses by the executive of individual rights.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.20}}

In 1976, a draft Bill of Rights was moved in the [[House of Lords]] by [[Donald Wade, Baron Wade|Lord Wade]] and in 1978 a House of Lords [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]] published a report recommending incorporation which was debated in the Lords leading to an amendment being moved which was requesting that the government introduce legislation on the matter.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.21}}{{sfnp|Feldman|2002|p=78}} Lord Wade succeeded in securing the Lords' approval for a draft [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] but it did not make any progress in the Commons where [[Alan Beith]]'s unsuccessful attempt to secure a [[second reading]] was poorly attended.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} There was concern at the time about judges deciding cases involving human rights which could lead them from their traditionally impartial role to political issues {{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.21}} In 1986 [[Derek Walker-Smith, Baron Broxbourne|Lord Broxbourne]] secured the Lords' approval for his incorporation bill, but was unsuccessful in the Commons, even though a second reading had been obtained.{{sfnp|Feldman|2002|p=78}}{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 1.55}} [[Edward Gardner (British politician)|Edward Gardner]]'s 1989 bill to incorporate the Convention also failed on its second reading.{{sfnp|Fenwick|2007|p=143}}{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 1.55}} At the time, official Conservative party policy was in favour of maintaining the existing constitutional arrangements which it saw as ensuring a high standard of protection of individual rights.{{sfnp|Fenwick|2007|p=143}}{{sfnp|Amos|2006|p=6}}

By 1991 the momentum for incorporation had grown, garnering support from organisations such as [[Charter88]], [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] and the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] – the latter two having published proposals for a British Bill of Rights incorporating the rights.{{sfnp|Feldman|2002|p=79}}{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 1.56}} Incorporation was also advocated by senior members of the [[judiciary]], both past and present, including [[Gerald Gardiner, Baron Gardiner|Lord Gardiner]], [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]], [[Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth|Lord Taylor]] and [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham]], by the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]] and the [[General Council of the Bar|Bar Council]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Following the [[1992 Labour Party leadership election|election]] of [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as Labour Party leader in 1992, Labour policy towards the Convention – which had been against it before and during the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 General Election]]{{sfnp|Fenwick|2007|p=141}} – began to change in favour of incorporation.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.22}}{{sfnp|Feldman|2002|p=78}}{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 1.57}} Smith gave a speech on 1 March 1993 entitled "A Citizen's Democracy" in which he called for a "new constitutional settlement, a new deal between the people and the state that puts the citizen centre stage".<ref>{{cite news | title = Smith backs reform of state | date = 2 March 1993 | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate = 4 November 2013 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/smith-backs-reform-of-state-1495095.html}}</ref> This was followed by the [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Labour Party Conference]] in October 1993 which agreed in a two-stage policy whereby the Convention would be incorporated into law followed by the enactment of a Bill of Rights.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.22}} It was planned to entrench Convention rights using a "notwithstanding clause" similar to that in [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which would have led to the Convention prevailing over legislation passed by Parliament unless stated otherwise.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.22}} A human rights commission would also be set up to monitor and promote human rights.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.22}}

In November 1994 Lord Lester introduced a bill in the Lords which was based on the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights]] which would give the Convention a similar status in UK law as that accorded to [[European Community law]] by allowing courts to disapply future and existing [[Acts of Parliament]] which were incompatible with it, imposing a duty on public authorities to comply and making provision for effective remedies including damages for breaches.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.23}} Introduced during a period of concern over the impact of European Community law on the [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|Parliamentary sovereignty]], the bill did not receive support from the [[Second Major ministry|Conservative government]] and failed in the Commons due to lack of time.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.23}}{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 1.58}}

On 18 December 1996, the shadow Labour Home Secretary [[Jack Straw]] and [[Paul Boateng]] published a Consultation Paper headed "Bringing Rights Home" which set out Labour's plans to incorporate the Convention if it won the next election.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.24}} The paper focused on the first stage of Labour's human rights policy and how the Convention should be incorporated, notably as regards its ability to override [[statutory law]].{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 1.24}} On 5 March 1997 a Labour and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Consultative Committee on Constitutional Reform chaired by [[Robin Cook]] and [[Robert Maclennan, Baron Maclennan of Rogart|Robert Maclennan]] published a report calling for the creation of a "Human Rights Commissioner" to oversee the operation of the legislation and to bring cases on behalf of those seeking protection of their rights.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Passage through Parliament===

The bill successfully negotiated the Commons and the Lords and entered into force on 2 October 2000 as the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].{{sfnp|Fenwick|2007|p=160}}

==Human Rights Act 1998==
{{Main|Human Rights Act 1998|UK constitutional law}}
The Human Rights Act 1998 seeks to give direct effect to the European Convention on Human Rights in domestic law by enabling claimants to bring an action in national courts instead of having to take their case before the European Court of Human Rights, as had previously been the case.{{sfnp|Amos|2006|p=8}} The Act makes it unlawful for a public authority to act in a manner contrary to certain rights prescribed by the Convention{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 3.15}} and allows a [[Courts of the United Kingdom|UK court]] to award a remedy in the event of a breach.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 3.23}} In principle, the Act has [[vertical effect]] in that it operates only vis-à-vis public bodies and not private parties.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 3.05}} There are however certain situations in which the Act can be indirectly invoked against a private person.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 3.72}}

[[Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998|Section 3 of the Act]] requires primary and secondary legislation to be given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention insofar as this is possible.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 3.11}} If the legislation cannot be interpreted in a manner which is compatible, this does not affect its validity, continuing operation or enforcement.{{sfnp|Wadham|Mountfield|Prochaska|Brown|2011|loc=para. 3.14}} In such a situation, [[Sections 4 and 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998|section 4 of the Act]] allows a court to make a [[declaration of incompatibility]] which has no direct effect on the legislation nor any practical consequences for the case in which it is made;{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 4.91}} it allows Parliament to take remedial action without being obliged to do so.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 4.91}}

Human rights in Scotland are given legal effect through the [[Scotland Act 1998]]. Section 57(2) of the Act states: "A member of the Scottish Executive has no power to make any subordinate legislation, or to do any other act, so far as the legislation or act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights…”<ref>{{cite web|title=Protecting and promoting human rights at home and abroad|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/policies/human-rights|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=6 August 2015}}</ref>

UK human rights legislation has been criticised by some for what they perceive as excessive attention to the human rights of offenders at the expense of those of victims; high-profile cases, such as those of [[Learco Chindamo]]<ref name="dc">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/08/22/nlawrence122.xml David Cameron: Scrap the Human Rights Act], 24 August 2007, ''Daily Telegraph''</ref> and the [[2006 Afghan hijackers case|2006 Afghan hijackers]],<ref name="2af">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4760539.stm Hijacker ruling draws criticism], BBC News, 12 May 2006</ref> have attracted controversy, sparking calls{{who|date=April 2016}} for the review of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and other legislation. [[David Cameron]] in his [[Second Cameron ministry|second ministry]] announced plans to replace the Human Rights Act with a "[[Proposed British Bill of Rights|British Bill of Rights]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-33134338|title=Cameron 'will fix human rights mess'|date=15 June 2015|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

==Rights in domestic law==
Both the common law and the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] are domestic sources of rights. Since 1998, through judicial development, the two have increasingly converged as the dominant view is that the ordinary rules of tort, equity, contract or property can accommodate human rights. As [[Lord Bingham]] put it in 2008,<ref>''[[Van Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire]]'' [2008] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/50.html UKHL 50]; [2009] 1 AC 225 at [58]</ref>

{{Cquote|one would ordinarily be surprised if conduct which violated a fundamental right or freedom of the individual did not find a reflection in a body of law ordinarily as sensitive to human needs as the common law, and it is demonstrable that the common law in some areas has evolved in a direction signalled by the Convention...}}

The modern law contrasts to the older view, represented by [[A. V. Dicey]] that "at no time has there in England been any proclamation of the right to liberty of thought or to freedom of speech, [...] it can hardly be said that our constitution knows of such a thing as any specific right of public meeting".{{sfnp|Dicey|1889|pp=239-240, 271}}

===Life===
{{Main|ECHR article 2|Right to life}}
The common law ensures the protection of the right to life and that no person is deprived of life intentionally.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 7.08}} This is achieved primarily through the [[criminal law]] and the crimes of [[Murder in English law|murder]] and [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]].{{sfnp|Lester|Oliver|1997|loc=para. 106}} Some protection is also offered by the civil law where, for example, the [[Fatal Accidents Act 1976]] allows relatives of those killed by the wrongdoing of others to recover damages.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|Capital punishment]] had by 1998 been abolished in respect of all offences.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 7.20}} Under the [[Coroners Act 1988]] there is a duty in certain circumstances for deaths to be investigated by a [[coroner]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 7.44}}

The law also attaches importance to the preservation of life: aiding and abetting a [[suicide]] is a criminal offence under the [[Suicide Act 1961]] and [[euthanasia]] is unlawful (see the [[Tony Bland#The case|Bland case]]).{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 7.09}} Furthermore, there is a duty upon medical professionals to keep patients alive unless to do so would be contrary to the patient's best interests based on professional medical opinion (the [[Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee|Bolam Test]]), taking into account their quality of life in the event that treatment is continued.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 7.24}} The [[Abortion Act 1967]] permits the termination of a pregnancy under certain conditions and the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]] requires the storage of embryos to be licensed.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=paras. 7.16 and 7.19}}

There is also an obligation on the state to prevent [[Extreme poverty|destitution]] and [[neglect]] by providing relief to persons who may otherwise [[Starvation|starve to death]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 5.130}}<ref>{{cite court | litigants = R v Inhabitants of Eastbourne | vol = (1803) 4 East 103}}</ref>

===No forced labour===
{{main|ECHR article 4|Slavery at common law}}
Slavery was abolished throughout much of the [[British Empire]] by the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] but as early as 1706 the common law had recognised that as soon as a slave came to [[England]], he became free.<ref>{{cite court | litigants = Smith v Brown and Cooper | vol = (1706) 2 Ld Raym 1274}}</ref>{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 9.06}} The courts did not recognise contracts which were equivalent to slavery or servitude.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 9.06}}

The courts have been reluctant to force individuals to work and have declined to enforce [[Employment contract|contracts of service]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 9.07}} [[Unfree labour|Forced labour]] is however permitted in certain limited circumstances: the Crown can theoretically compel persons to undertake [[Her Majesty's Naval Service|naval service]] and [[prisoner]]s can be forced to work whilst serving their sentences.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=paras. 9.08-9.09}}

The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] considered the forced labour prohibition in [[Caitlin Reilly and Jamieson Wilson v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]], where it ruled that the [[Department for Work and Pensions]]' [[Workfare in the United Kingdom|workfare policy]] under which the [[Unemployment|unemployed]] work in return for their [[Unemployment benefits|benefit payments]] were not forced labour but were nevertheless legally flawed.<ref>{{cite news | title = Government fail to overturn Poundland work scheme ruling | date = 30 October 2013 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24742499 | work = [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate = 30 October 2013}}</ref>

===Liberty===
{{main|ECHR article 5|Liberty|Right to liberty}}
{{Clist liberty}}
The right to [[liberty]] of the person, to be free from the domination or servitude of others, and only to lose one's liberty 'by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land' has been fundamental to UK and English law since the [[Magna Carta]].<ref>[[Magna Carta 1215]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw1cc1929/25/9/section/XXIX ch XXIX], 'NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.'</ref> This said, slavery and serfdom took until the 16th century to break down in England, and was maintained at least until 1833 within the [[British Empire]], before full abolition of [[forced labour]] was passed, extending the writ of [[habeas corpus]] (the right to one's own body) to everyone.<ref>cf ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'' (1772) 98 ER 499, and now [[ECHR article 4|article 4]].

[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights#Article_9 arts 9-16]
</ref> the [[European Convention on Human Rights article 5]] states no 'one shall be deprived of [their] liberty' unless law expressly allows that person's detention after conviction, a lawful arrest or detention on suspicion of an offence, detention of a minor for education, detention for health or stopping infectious diseases spreading, or for lawful deportation or extradition.<ref>ECHR art 5(1)</ref> People must be told reasons for any detention, be put on trial in a reasonable time, or released immediately with compensation if detention was unlawful.<ref>ECHR art 5(2)-(5)</ref> In practice, every power of the police or the state to maintain order and security 'inevitably means a corresponding reduction in the liberty of the individual',<ref>AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2018) 398, 'Every power conferred on police officers inevitably means a corresponding reduction in the liberty of the individual, and brings us face to face with Convention obligations.'</ref> and the UK has among the highest spending on policing in the world.<ref>Home Affairs Committee, ''Policing in the 21st Century'' (2007–08) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmhaff/364/364i.pdf HC 364-I], para 67, the UK spent 2.5% of GDP on police, the [[OECD]]'s highest.</ref> For this reason the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], and the limits to police powers, is a key legislative guardian of liberty in the UK today.

Three main issues of police power and liberty are (1) powers of arrest, detention and questioning, (2) powers to enter, search or seize property, and (3) the accountability of the police for abuse of power. First, the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] section 1 allows a constable to stop and search people if a constable 'has reasonable grounds for suspecting' that they will 'find stolen or prohibited articles', they may seize the articles, and they may use reasonable force.<ref>[[PACEA 1984]] ss 1 and 117</ref> The constable must give their name, police station, and grounds for the search. People cannot be made to remove clothing in public, except an outer coat, jacket or gloves.<ref>[[PACEA 1984]] s 2, and s 3 requires details are recorded.</ref> Because of the widespread problem of [[race discrimination]] in stop and search, the Home Office Code A says that 'reasonable suspicion cannot be based on generalisations or stereotypical images' of people being involved in crime.<ref>Home Office Code A, para 2.2B(b). The [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] s 23 enables stop and search powers for unlawful drugs. M Townsend, 'Racial bias in police stop and search getting worse, report reveals' (13 October 2018) [https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/oct/13/racial-bias-police-stop-and-search-policy-black-people-report Guardian], finds black people are 9 times more likely than white people to be searched. In 2019, 43% of searches in London were on black people: (26 January 2019) [https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people Guardian].

In 2015 the Supreme Court held suspicionless searches were held to be compatible with [[ECHR article 5]].<ref>''[[R (Roberts) v MPC]]'' [2015] UKSC 79.</ref> Under section 24, constables can arrest people without a warrant if they are committing an offence, or if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting they will.<ref>[[PACEA 1984]] s 24</ref> The meaning of 'reasonable grounds' is not exacting, but a police officer must not arrest someone in bad faith, or irrationally, or if a suspect is cooperating and arrest is therefore unnecessary.<ref>''[[Alanov v Sussex CC]]'' [2012] EWCA Civ 235, 'the "threshold" for the existence of "reasonable grounds" for suspicion is low... small, even sparse.' Also ''[[R (TL) v Surrey CC]]'' [2017] EWHC 129</ref> Otherwise, a justice of the peace may issue a warrant for arrest, require attendance at court, in writing, and it can be executed by a constable.<ref>[[Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980]] s 1 and 125D-126. nb [[Constables’ Protection Act 1750]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Geo2/24/44/section/6 s 6] means a constable who arrests someone in good faith is protected from liability from arrest if it turns out the warrant was beyond the jurisdiction of the person who issued it.</ref> With a warrant, a constable can enter and search premises to make an arrest, or enter and search after an arrest. In addition, any person can make a '[[citizens' arrest]] of another person who is in the act of committing an [[indictable offence]].<ref>[[PACEA 1984]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A s 24A]</ref> Anyone being arrested must be told the fact of arrest, and the reasons, or be told as soon as practicable, and if they are not the arrest is unlawful.<ref>[[PACEA 1984]] s 28. ''[[Hill v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire]]'' [1990] 1 All ER 1046, s 28 is a rule ‘laid down by Parliament to protect the individual against the excess or abuse of the power of arrest’. ''[[Christie v Leachinsky]]'' [1947] AC 573, 'the arrested man is entitled to be told what is the act for which he is arrested.'</ref> 

People who are arrested must be brought to a police station as soon as practicable, and there must either be released, charged or detained for questioning.<ref>[[PACEA 1984]] ss 30-39</ref> People can only be detained without charge for 24 hours, but this can be extended to 36 hours for an [[indictable offence]], or another 36 hours (i.e. 72 hours in total) but only with approval of a magistrate's court where the detainee has a right to legal representation.<ref>[[PACEA 1984]] ss 41-45ZA.</ref> People can be searched at a police station with an [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|inspector]]'s authority, but can only do intimate searches of orifices if there are reasonable grounds for thinking there is a class A drug or article that could cause injury. A detainee has the right to inform a friend or relative, and consult a solicitor, but this right can be delayed by 36 hours if arrested for an indictable offence or 48 hours for terrorism.<ref>[[PACEA 1984]] ss 54-58 and [[Terrorism Act 2000]] s 41 and Sch 8 para 9. ''[[Ibrahim v UK]]'' [2016] ECHR 750, suggests that damages were recoverable for denial of access to a solicitor in breach of Convention rights. cf ''[[Cullen v Chief Constable of the RUC]]'' [2003] UKHL 39, held there was no right to damages for failure to permit legal representatives, but evidence may be inadmissible.</ref> Interviews should be recorded, people can be photographed and drug tested without their consent.

Second, police officers have no right to trespass upon property without a lawful warrant, because as [[Lord Camden]] said in ''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' by 'the law of England every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass.' Here a sheriff searched and seized property at the home of a journalist, [[John Entick]], but the 'warrant' used by the sheriff had no legal basis. The Court held that the sheriff had to pay damages. Today, under the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] section 8 enables officers to enter premises and search but only based on a warrant granted by a justice of the peace. There is no right to search communications between lawyer and a client, or confidential personal records, some medical materials, and confidential journalistic material, unless there is an order of a judge.<ref>[[PACEA 1984]] ss 9-14 and Sch 1, paras 4-12.

Anyone can bring a claim against police for unlawful conduct, the chief constable is vicariously liable for constables' conduct, and [[exemplary damages]] are available for 'oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional actions'.<ref>[[Police Act 1996]] s 88, [[Police Reform Act 2002]] s 42 and ''[[Kuddus v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary]]'' [2001] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/29.html UKHL 29]</ref> Evidence illegally obtained, such as a confession, and certainly anything through 'torture, inhuman or degrading treatment and the use or threat of violence' must be excluded, and a court can refuse evidence if it would have an adverse effect on the fairness of proceedings.<ref>[[PACEA 1984]] ss 76-78 and see ''[[R v Khan]]'' [1997] AC 558, an illegally placed surveillance device evidence was admissible, even with probable ECHR art 8 breach, but merely 'a consideration which may be taken into account for what it is worth'.

===Fair trial===
{{main|ECHR article 6|Right to a fair trial|ECHR article 7|Ex post facto law}}
[[ECHR article 6|Article 6]] of the Convention requires a [[fair trial]], with a presumption of innocence, and [[legal aid]] if justice requires it, according to principles of [[natural justice]]. [[ECHR article 7|Article 7]] prohibits criminal offences applying retroactively to acts done before something was made criminal.

===Privacy===
{{main|ECHR article 8|Right to privacy|Privacy in English law|Privacy|Surveillance}}
{{Clist privacy}}
The constitutional importance of privacy, of one's home, belongings, and correspondence, has been recognised since 1604, when [[Sir Edward Coke]] wrote that the 'house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress'.<ref>''[[Semayne’s case]]'' (1604) 77 Eng Rep 194, Sir Edward Coke, 'The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose.'</ref> Today it is clear that common law recognises "the tort of invasion of privacy".<ref name="auto1">''[[PJS v News Group Newspapers Ltd]]'' [2016] UKSC 26, [32]</ref> While rights to liberty and a fair trial also protect against unjustified search or seizure, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] article 8 enshrines the right to one's 'private and family life', 'home' and 'correspondence' unless interference is 'in accordance with the law' and '[[necessary in a democratic society]]' for public security, safety, economic well-being, preventing crime, protecting health or morals or rights of others.<ref>[[ECHR article 8]]</ref>

The law of trespass, as in ''[[Entick v Carrington]]'',<ref>(1765) 19 St Tr 1030</ref> traditionally protected against unjustified physical violations of people's homes, but given extensive powers of entry,<ref>[[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]] explanatory notes stated over 1300 statutory provisions enable entry into people's homes, and while ss 39-47 and Sch 2 enable a Minister to repeal and replace these powers, the government continued to add them, eg [[Scrap Metal Dealers Act 2013]] s 16(1)</ref> and with modern information technology the central concerns of privacy are electronic surveillance, both by the state and by private corporations aiming to profit from data or '[[surveillance capitalism]]'.<ref>See AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2018) ch 16, 429, not just the state but private parties violate privacy, highlighting 'newspapers engaged in a desperate circulation war, or employers checking on employees'. S Zuboff, ''The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power'' (2019)</ref> The four main fields of law relating to privacy concern (1) listening devices and interference with private property, (2) interception of mail, email or web communications by government, (3) mass data storage and processing by corporations or state bodies, and (4) other breaches of confidence and privacy, particularly by the press.

[[File:GCHQ at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire MOD 45154333.jpg|thumb|left|[[Government Communications HQ]], part of [[British intelligence agencies|UK intelligence]], is among the public bodies which can apply for warrants to put people under surveillance to detect serious crime. With the [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016]] these powers have steadily grown.]]
First, the [[Police Act 1997]] sections 92 prohibits 'interference with property or with wireless telegraphy' without authorisation by a chief constable or others.<ref>[[Police Act 1997]] s 92, following ''[[R v Khan]]'' [1997] AC 558, (2001) 31 EHRR 1016 which found there was no legal basis for police bugging, and therefore a violation of [[ECHR article 8]].</ref> Such listening or bugging devices may only be used 'for the prevention or detection of serious crime' that could lead to over 3 years of jail. A judicial commissioner's approval is further needed if a dwelling, bedroom or office is being bugged, and if refused the police can appeal to the [[Investigatory Powers Commissioner]].<ref>[[Police Act 1997]] s 104</ref> On top of this, the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] which also generally allows surveillance by police, intelligence, [[HMRC]] and councils to obtain private information ('directed'), or surveillance of a residence or vehicle ('intrusive') if for the purpose of national security, preventing serious crime, or protecting UK economic well-being. Only 'intrusive' surveillance requires approval by a judicial commissioner.<ref>[[RIPA 2000]] ss 26-36.</ref> This has frequently led to abuse, for instance, in one case with a family being put under surveillance to see if they lived in a catchment area of an oversubscribed school,<ref>Investigatory Powers Tribunal, Report 2010 (2011) 28.</ref> and in another an intelligence officer infiltrating a protest group and fathering a child, after taking a dead child's identity.<ref>''[[R v Barkshire]]'' [2011] EWCA Crim 1885.</ref>

Surveillance in public places does not engage the human right to privacy, according to ''[[Kinloch v HM Advocate]]'', where evidence of the defendant money laundering was gathered by police following the suspect in public spaces.<ref>[2012] UKSC 62, [21] Lord Hope, 'He took the risk of being seen and of his movements being noted down. The criminal nature of what he was doing, if that was what it was found to be, was not an aspect of his private life that he was entitled to keep private.'</ref> Second, although the [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016]] section 2 creates a duty to consider whether means less intrusive to privacy could be used, warrants can be issue for targeted or bulk interception of any data, including to assist other governments, but only to detect serious crime, protect national security, or protect the UK's economic well-being, and this must be proportionate.<ref>[[Investigatory Powers Act 2016]] ss 6 and 20</ref> Applications are made to the Home Secretary or other appropriate ministers, and must be approved by a judicial commissioner with written reasons for any refusal.<ref>[[IPA 2016]] ss 19 and 23</ref> Warrants can also be issued against Members of Parliament with the consent of the [[Prime Minister]].<ref>[[IPA 2016]] s 26</ref> Interception should not be disclosed in judicial proceedings.<ref>[[IPA 2016]] s 56</ref> Local councils are able to carry out interceptions, albeit with authority of a justice of the peace. Journalists' material can be intercepted, though only with authority of a judicial commissioner. The government can also require internet service providers retain data, including bulk data, for up to a year. Judicial commissioners must have held high judicial office, while the [[Investigatory Powers Commissioner]] audits, inspects and investigates the exercise of public body powers. In 2015, over 3059 warrants were granted, and it is argued by [[MI5]] that bulk data enables security services to 'make the right connections between disparate pieces of information'.<ref>''[[Privacy International v Foreign Secretary]]'' [2016] UKIPTrib 15_110-CH</ref> The fact of bulk data collection, however, inevitably means people who have nothing to do with serious crime remain under state surveillance.

[[File:Ad-tech London 2010 (5).JPG|thumb|right|The world's biggest tech corporations, particularly [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] have vast databases on user behaviour. In 2016, a scandal broke as it was found Facebook and other data was illegally taken and used for psychologically targeted adverts in the [[2016 Brexit poll]].<ref name="auto">House of Commons, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, ''Disinformation and 'fake news': Final Report'' (2019) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/1791.pdf HC 1791]</ref> The [[GDPR 2016]] creates minimal data rights.]]
Third, it has been recognised that the 'right to keep oneself to oneself, to tell other people that certain things are none of their business, is under technological threat' also from private corporations, as well as the state.<ref>''[[R v Brown]]'' [1996] 1 AC 541, 556, per [[Lord Hoffmann]]</ref> Through standard form [[English contract law|contracts]], tech corporations routinely appropriate users' private data for targeted advertising, particularly [[Google]] (e.g. search and browsing history, email, locations), [[Facebook]] (e.g. personal interactions, hobbies, messages), Microsoft (e.g. emails, or cloud documents) and others. Because people have no choice but to agree to the terms and conditions, consent is defective and contract terms are often unfair, legislation has been increasing in strength to reflect the fundamental 'right to the protection of personal data' in the [[European Union]].<ref>See the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 2000]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union#Article_8_%E2%80%93_Protection_of_personal_data art 8]</ref> The [[General Data Protection Regulation 2016]] requires that all data is processed lawfully, fairly and transparently, and on the basis of 'consent' or a contract.<ref>[[GDPR 2016]] arts 5-6</ref> The meaning of 'consent' requires more than the basic rules for commercial contracts, and must be clearly and distinctly identifiable, and revocable at any time.<ref>[[GDPR 2016]] arts 6-7</ref> Contract terms may be subject to more protective rights contained in UK law.<ref>See the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] at present.</ref> Whenever a 'data subject' has personal data processed or stored, they have basic rights to be provided with transparent information about the data stored including when they have not given that information themselves,<ref>[[GDPR 2016]] [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj arts 12-14]</ref> to access the data and rectify any inaccuracies, and to demand that the data is erased when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally given.<ref>[[GDPR 2016]] art 17. Also art 18 gives the right to restrict processing.</ref>

There is a further right that data must be portable 'to another controller without hindrance',<ref>[[GDPR 2016]] [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj art 20]</ref> for instance in switching phone contacts. Data may be disclosed for legitimate reasons, so in ''[[Rugby Football Union v Consolidated Information Services Ltd]]'' the Supreme Court held that a ticketing agency had no data protection defence against disclosing information to the Rugby Football Union about people who touted tickets against its rules, because the legitimate interest in stopping theft was stronger.<ref>[2012] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/55.html UKSC 55]</ref> Article 32 states a data controller must ensure the security of people's data, and notify supervisory authorities of any breach, including transfers to 'third countries' where the [[rule of law]] is defective. However, during the [[2016 Brexit referendum]] the House of Commons fake news committee found that Facebook enabled massive breaches of users' data, being sold onto third parties including [[Cambridge Analytica]], which psychologically targeted voters with political adverts, and this data spread into [[Russian interference in Brexit|Russia]].<ref>House of Commons, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, ''Disinformation and 'fake news': Final Report'' (2019) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/1791.pdf HC 1791], [150] and [255]-[256]</ref> The penalties for breach of GDPR rules, since it came into force in May 2018, can be up to 4% of a company's worldwide turnover, or €20m, whichever is higher.<ref>[[GDPR 2016]] art 83.</ref> There are also databases kept by UK state bodies, including the [[National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit|National Domestic Extremism Database]], a [[United Kingdom National DNA Database|DNA Database]],<ref>''[[S and Marper]]'' [2008] ECHR 1581, limits to retain DNA information</ref> and a [[Police National Computer]],<ref>[[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] s 27(4) and National Police Records (Recordable Offences) Regulations 2000/1139, recording people's convictions, cautions, reprimands, and warnings for any offence punishable with prison or in the Schedule.</ref> Related to this, the Supreme Court held in ''[[R(L) v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' that there was no breach of privacy when a primary school's enhanced criminal record check on an applicant for a teaching assistant job showed the applicant's son was put on a child protection register because of neglect, and she was refused a job.<ref>[2009] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2009/3.html UKSC 3]</ref>

===Thought, conscience and religion===
{{Main|ECHR article 9|Freedom of conscience|Freedom of thought|Freedom of religion in the United Kingdom}}
[[ECHR article 9|Article 9]] states that everyone has the right to freedom of conscience, including religion and belief. Only the manifestation of a belief can be limited on justifiable legal grounds as strictly necessary in a democracy.<ref>cf ''[[Ahmad v Inner London Education Authority]]'' [1978] QB 38, and ''[[Redfearn v Serco Ltd]]'' [2012] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/1878.html ECHR 1878]</ref>

By contrast, the common law historically required punishment for "erroneous opinions concerning rites or modes of worship" to be provided for in legislation before it could be applied.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 14.03}}<ref>{{cite court | litigants = Harrison v Evans | vol = (1767) 3 Bro Parl Cas 465}}</ref> There were a number of such laws in the 17th and 18th centuries, including the [[Corporation Act 1661]] requiring holders of civic office to be members of the [[Church of England]] and the [[Test Act 1673]] requiring holders of military or civil functions to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance and subscribe to a declaration against [[transubstantiation]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 14.03}} Both Acts were repealed by the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] which admitted [[Catholicism|Catholics]] into the legal profession and permitted Catholic schools and places of worship.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 14.03}} [[Jews]] were allowed to enter Parliament under the [[Jews Relief Act 1858]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 14.03}} The [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] amended the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] to remove the exclusion from the [[Line of succession to the British throne|line of succession]] of those who married Catholics.<ref>{{cite news | title = Law ending exclusively male royal succession now law | date = 25 April 2013 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22300293 | work = [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate = 30 October 2013}}</ref> However, it remains the case that the Sovereign must be a member of the Church of England.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 14.24}}

===Expression===
{{main|ECHR article 10|Freedom of speech|Freedom of expression}}
{{Clist expression}}
The right to freedom of expression is generally seen as being the 'lifeblood of democracy.'<ref>''[[R v Home Secretary, ex p Simms]]'' [2000] 2 AC 115, 126</ref> After the [[English Civil War]], it was established that a jury could acquit a [[Quaker]] who preached to a crowd even against the judge's direction and 'against full and manifest evidence'.<ref>''[[R v Penn and Mead]]'' or ''[[Bushell’s case]]'' (1670) 6 St Tr 951, prosecuting Quakers under the [[Religion Act 1592]] (offence to not attend church) and the [[Conventicle Act 1664]] and [[Conventicles Act 1670]] (prohibitions on religious gatherings over five people outside the Church of England).</ref>

The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] article 9 guaranteed the 'freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament' and stated they were 'not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament', but the first full, legal guarantees for free speech came from the [[American Revolution]], when the [[First Amendment to the US Constitution]] guaranteed 'freedom of speech'. The government and employers suppressed free speech through the French revolution and after the Napoleonic wars,<ref>eg ''[[R v Lovelass]]'' (1834) 172 ER 1380 on the transportation of the [[Tolpuddle martyrs]] under the [[Unlawful Oaths Act 1797]].</ref> until the repeal of the anti-Catholic laws,<ref>[[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]], and contrast the [[Gordon Riots]] following the [[Papists Act 1778]].</ref> and the abolition of restraints on trade union organising, as well as throughout the [[British Empire]]. But after [[World War Two]], the UK signed the [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]], and joined the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention]]. [[ECHR article 10|Article 10]] enshrines the right to freedom of expression which includes the rights 'to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.' This does not prevent 'the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.' Like all other rights these are subject to restrictions set out in law, and as necessary in a democratic society, to stop crime, or protect security, territorial integrity, safety, health, morals, the rights of others, and to maintain the judiciary's impartiality.<ref>In international law, the duty to stop war propaganda and incitement of discrimination is made explicit: see [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights#Article_18 arts 18-20]</ref>

Debating and free speech societies are found throughout the UK and make a regular part of TV.<ref>The oldest free speech and debating society in the world is [[Cogers]] (est 1755), while [[The Cambridge Union]] was established in 1815, and the [[Oxford Union]] in 1823. Most universities have student debating societies.</ref>]]
The practical right to free expression is limited by (1) unaccountable ownership in the media, (2) censorship and obscenity laws, (3) public order offences, and (4) the law of defamation and breach of confidence. First, although anybody can stand on [[Speakers’ Corner]], in [[Parliament Square]], or in [[Trafalgar Square]] and speak freely to a crowd,<ref>Generally the same laws apply to these places of free speech as in the whole country: see ''[[Redmond-Bate v DPP]] [2000] HRLR 249 (Speakers' Corner), ''[[Bailey v Williamson]]'' (1873) 8 QBD 118 (Hyde Park), and ''[[DPP v Haw]]'' [2007] EWHC 1931 (Admin).</ref> the communication channels with the biggest audiences are owned by large corporate entities:<ref>cf [[Leveson Report]] (2012-13) HC 779 discussing media concentration and competition.</ref> three internet media networks,<ref>In 2019, these were (1) Youtube and Google, owned by Alphabet, which is controlled by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] (2) Facebook, controlled by [[Mark Zuckerberg]], and (3) [[Twitter]], controlled by [[Jack Dorsey]].</ref> five television networks,<ref>In 2019, these were (1) the [[BBC]], owned by an arms-length public corporation ultimately accountable to the UK government (2) [[Channel 4 (UK)|Channel 4]], a public corporation set up under the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], (3) [[ITV plc|ITV]], owned by asset managers such as [[Capital Group Companies]], [[Ameriprise Financial]] and [[BlackRock]] (4) Channel 5, owned by [[Viacom Inc]], where 80% of votes on shares are controlled by [[Sumner Redstone]], and (5) [[Sky (company)|Sky]], owned by [[Comcast]] which is controlled by [[Brian L. Roberts]].</ref> and six corporate owned newspaper groups,<ref>In 2019, the largest by website and circulation were (1) the [[Daily Mail]], [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] and [[Evening Standard]], largely owned by [[Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere]] through [[Daily Mail and General Trust plc]], (2) [[The Times]], and [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]], controlled by [[Rupert Murdoch]] through [[Newscorp]], (3) the [[Daily Mirror]], [[Daily Express]] and [[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]], controlled by [[Reach plc]] (4) the Guardian and the Observer, owned by [[Scott Trust Limited]] which has a board must guard editorial independence, but which appoints itself [https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/07/24/1.4_STL_corporate_governance_2018.pdf article 63], but this could be changed (for instance to include workers or readers) with 75% approval of directors under article 7, (5) the [[Daily Telegraph]], controlled by the [[Barclay Brothers]], and (6) [[The Independent]] and [[The i]], controlled by [[Alexander Lebedev]] (who also has a majority stake with Lord Rothermere in the Evening Standard.</ref> almost all of which aim have shareholders that demand to make a profit.<ref>AW Bradley, [[KD Ewing]] and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2018) 464, ‘most newspapers are commercial enterprises whose first duty is one arising under private law to maximise shareholder return.’ There is no formal legal duty to maximise shareholder returns under the [[Companies Act 2006]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/172 s 172], but in practice where shareholders monopolise votes to dismiss the board under [[CA 2006]] s 168, this becomes the duty in practice, and the culture: see [[S Deakin]], 'The Coming Transformation of Shareholder Value' (2005) [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8683.2005.00399.x 13(1) Corporate Governance 11].</ref> This means that most speech, with most reach, is designed to be compatible with generating advertising revenue and shareholder profit for the newspaper, TV, or internet corporation, and controllers choose which speech or images are acceptable, unless the law creates different rights. While there are loose limits on cross-ownership of TV and newspapers,<ref>[[Communications Act 2003]] s 3 requires [[Ofcom]] to maintain 'sufficient plurality', s 391, requires regular review of media ownership by Ofcom, sent to Secretary of State, under the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] Sch 2, and CA 2003 Sch 14, para 1, states a person cannot hold a Channel 3 (ITV) licence if he runs a national newspaper/s with market share over 20% over a 6 month period.</ref> there is no regulation yet separate advertising business and internet media platforms where their interests conflict with public goals. The [[Communications Act 2003]] sections 319–321, regulates television (but not explicitly internet broadcasts, or newspapers) to ensure that diverse views are heard, and to restrict discriminatory viewing, or the stop misleading information, and allows a complaints procedure.<ref>This is detailed by the Ofcom, ''[[Broadcasting Code]]'' (2017). An [[Independent Press Standards Organisation]] operates for newspapers, see ''[[R (News Media Association) v Press Recognition Panel]]'' [2017] EWHC 2527, but this has no publicly accountable legal basis after the industry chose to boycott one.</ref> The UK's transparent, and publicly accountable system of TV media regulation is consistently held to be compatible with freedom of expression.<ref>e.g. ''[[R (Pro-Life Alliance) v BBC]]'' [2003] UKHL 23 finding that a ban on an anti-abortion group showing 'prolonged and deeply disturbing' images of an aborted foetus for a TV campaign advert did not violate [[ECHR article 10]]. cf ''[[R v Central Independent Television plc]]'' [1994] Fam 192</ref> Two of the UK’s TV networks, the BBC and Channel 4, are publicly owned and accountable, through an arm’s length appointment process overseen by the government. However most television channels are funded through advertising revenue. There is also effectively no regulation of standards on internet media, although the House of Commons committee on fake news called for the same regulation as on TV to be applied after Facebook data theft and psychologically targeted political ads were used by ‘Vote Leave’ in the [[2016 Brexit poll]].<ref name="auto"/>

Second, censorship and obscenity laws have been a highly traditional limit on freedom of expression. The [[Theatres Act 1968]] prohibits obscenity in plays, that is 'indecent, offensive, disgusting or injurious to morality' but with a defence in the public good, while the [[Video Recordings Act 1984]] section 9 makes it illegal to supply of a video without a classification certificate, which is graded according to sexual or violent activity. Obscene publications, since early common law,<ref>eg ''[[Curl’s case]]'' (1727) 17 St Tr 153</ref> have been banned although the idea of what is 'obscene' has changed from Victorian values.<ref>In the [[Obscene Publications Act 1857]] debate, Lord Campbell, HL Deb (25 June 1857) col 329 said obscene meant 'exclusively to works written for the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth, and of a nature calculated to shock the common feelings of decency in any well regulated mind'. In ''[[R v Hicklin]]'' (1868) LR 3 QB 360, [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Lord Cockburn CJ]] (a notorious womaniser) held there immunity for a medical treatise depended on the circumstances, and the author's intent could be taken into account.</ref> The [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] defines 'obscene' as having the effect to 'deprave and corrupt' people, and allows police or the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] to search and seize obscene material, subject to a defence for literary, artistic, scientific or other merit. Pornography, but also non-sexual gay literature, was suppressed until the 1990s,<ref>See ''[[Shaw v DPP]]'' [1962] AC 220, finding obscene an illustrated magazine with contacts for prositutes, and convicting the publisher, Shaw, for conspiracy, Lord Reid dissenting. ''[[Knuller Ltd v DPP]]'' [1973] AC 435 finding a gay magazine for men to meet other men was involved in a 'conspiracy' to 'corrupt public morals' even though homosexuality ceased to be criminal in the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], Lord Reid and Lord Diplock dissenting.</ref> There are around 70 cases each year, but today the [[Criminal Prosecution Service]] Guidelines only recommend charges for 'extreme' cases. The controversial [[Digital Economy Act 2017]], which would have required age verification on the basis of protecting children to access all pornographic websites, by requiring companies take bank card details, has been repeatedly delayed. Third, there are three main public order offences, based on incitement to disaffection, racial hatred, and terrorism.<ref>Old offences of seditious libel and blasphemous libel were removed by the [[Criminal Justice and Coroners Act 2009]] s 73. See previously ''[[R v Burns]]'' (1886) 16 Cox CC 355, ''[[R v Aldred]]'' (1909) 22 Cos CC 1, ''[[R v Lemon]]'' [1979] AC 617, and ''[[Gay News Ltd v UK]]'' (1982) 5 EHRR 123 (linking Jesus Christ to homosexuality).</ref> Disaffection means attempting to persuade the armed forces,<ref>[[Incitement to Disaffection Act 1934]], makes it an offence to maliciously and advisedly endeavour to seduce a member of the armed forces from that person’s duty or allegiance.</ref> police,<ref>[[Police Act 1996]] s 91 prohibits causing disaffection among police officers or inducing them to withhold services or commit breaches of discipline. This effectively prohibits strikes, or calling for them, although it appears unenforceable in practice.</ref> or others,<ref>Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act 1919 s 3 prohibits an 'alien' from causing sedition or disaffection among civil population and armed forces.</ref> to revolt or even withhold services. Racial hatred means 'hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins', and it is an offence to threaten, abuse or insult anyone, including through displays, to stir up racial hatred.<ref>[[Public Order Act 1986]] ss 17-27, first introduced in the [[Race Relations Act 1965]].</ref> The same idea extends to religious hatred, sexual orientation and in practice disability.<ref>Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 s 1, inserted [[POA 1986]] ss 29A-29N. [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] s 74, Sch 16. College of Policing, ''Hate Crime Operational Guidance'' (2014) on disability.</ref> In international law, it is also explicit, that advocacy of hatred includes 'incitement to discrimination' (as well as hosility or violence).<ref>[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights#Article_20 art 20] '(1) Any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law. (2) Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.' In the UK this would engage the [[Equality Act 2010]], and could include incitement to discriminate against immigrants.</ref> The [[Terrorism Act 2006]] defines incitement to terrorism as 'direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement' for 'commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism', as well as glorifying terrorist acts (that is 'any form of praise or celebration') punishable with 7 years in prison.<ref>[[Terrorism Act 2006]] ss 1-3 and 20</ref> Fourth, the laws of [[defamation]] and [[breach of confidence]] are designed to balance people's reputations and rights to privacy. The [[Defamation Act 2013]] states that defamation means a statement that has or would 'cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant', and if that claimant is a profit making body this requires 'serious financial loss'.<ref>A trade union, central and local government appear unable to bring defamation claims: ''[[EETPU v Times Newspapers]]'' [1980] 1 All ER 1097 (trade unions), ''[[Derbyshire CC v Times Newspapers Ltd]]'' [1993] AC 534 (local government).</ref>

The truth is always a defence for stating something factual, and a defendant may always show their statement 'is substantially true', or that they made a statement of honest opinion, rather than an assertion of fact. Further, of the statement is in the public interest, it will not be unlawful. Connected to this, news outlets should ask someone who is a subject of a story for their side.<ref>''[[Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd]]'' [2001] 2 AC 127</ref> Internet operators are liable for statements on their websites that are defamatory if the poster is hard to identify, and they fail on a notice by the claimant to remove the statement within 48 hours.<ref>[[Defamation Act 2013]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/26/section/5 s 5] and The Defamation (Operators of Websites) Regulations 2013 [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/3028/schedule/made Schedule]</ref> There can be no claim for defamation if a defendant has the 'absolute privilege' of making a statement in Parliament or reports, in the course of high state duty, internal documents or a foreign embassy, or reports of courts' proceedings.<ref>''[[Prebble v Television New Zealand Ltd]]'' [1995] 1 AC 321, ''[[Chatterton v Secretary of State of India]]'' [1895] 2 QB 189, ''[[Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967]] s 10(5), ''[[Al-Fayed v Al-Tajir]]'' [1988] QB 712, [[Defamation Act 1996]] s 14(3)</ref> There is also 'qualified privilege' which gives a defence to defamation, but only if the writer asks the subject for an explanation or contradiction, for any legislative proceedings outside the UK, public enquiries, non-UK government documents, and matters of an international organisation.<ref>''[[Webb v Times Publishing Co]]'' [1960] 2 QB 535, ''[[Tsikata v Newspaper Publishing plc]]'' [1997] 1 All ER 655, ''[[Curistan v Times Newspapers Ltd]]'' [2008] EWCA Civ 432, and Defamation Act 1996 Sch 1, part 1.</ref> Given the global nature of media, a claim in the UK must ensure that the UK is the 'most appropriate place', there is no long trial by jury, and courts can order removal of claims from many websites if it has spread.<ref>Defamation Act 2013 ss 9-13</ref> Claims for breach of confidence are meant to protect the right to privacy. Examples have included an [[injunction]] against a retired security service officer who wrote a book called ''[[Spycatcher]]'' that revealed official secrets.<ref>''[[Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd]]'' (1992) 14 EHRR 153</ref> But the government lost its claim to have an injunction against a newspaper on the effects of [[thalidomide]] on new births.<ref>''[[Sunday Times v United Kingdom]]'' (1979–80) 2 EHRR 245</ref>

The courts have stated that there is no difference between the protection offered by the common law, and that guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights.<ref>{{cite court | litigants = [[Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd|Attorney-General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No. 2)]] | vol = [1988] UKHL 6 | url = http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1988/6.html}}</ref>

On 23 June 2020, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) said, the [[Russia|Russian]] authorities suppress the [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] by blocking several websites in recent years, including some run by critics of President [[Vladimir Putin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/23/european-rights-court-faults-russia-over-website-blocking.html|title= European rights court faults Russia over website blocking|accessdate=22 June 2020|website=The jakartapost}}</ref>

===Association and assembly===
{{main|ECHR article 11|UK labour law|Freedom of association|Freedom of assembly|Right to protest}}
{{Clist association}}
The rights to [[freedom of association]] and [[freedom of assembly]] are central to the functioning of [[democracy]] because they are the basis for [[political]] organisation and discourse.<ref>AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2018) ch 18 and E McGaughey, ''A Casebook on Labour Law'' (2019) ch 8, 324, stating freedom of association "is fundamental to democratic society... workers taking collective action were major... factors contributing to the deposition of German Kaiser in 1918, Indian independence in 1948, the victory of the US civil rights movement in 1964, the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, and the end of apartheid South Africa in 1994".</ref> [[Political parties]], [[trade unions]], social campaign groups, and businesses all associate freely in democratic societies, and take action upon that freedom, including through assemblies, strikes, or protests. Also protected in [[international law]],<ref>[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights#Article_20 arts 20 and 23]. Also, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966]] arts 21-22 and [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966]] art 8, both ratified by the UK.</ref> the [[European Convention on Human Rights article 11]] states: 'Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others' including joining 'trade unions for the protection of' their interests. Like with other rights, this cannot be restricted without a lawful justification, that goes no further than necessary in a democratic society, to protect security, safety, health or other people's rights.

Generally, the right to freedom of association involves three main principles.<ref>KD Ewing, 'The Implications of Wilson and Palmer' (2003) 32(1) Industrial Law Journal 1-22</ref> First, there is a right to suffer no disadvantage for associating with others, for instance, because if an employer penalises workers for joining a trade union.<ref>''[[Wilson v United Kingdom]]'' [2002] ECHR 552, where an employee for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' who was not given a raise after he refused to give up trade union membership was held to have suffered an unlawful detriment, violating his freedom of association.</ref> Second, one must be able to associate with others on the terms one wishes so that, for example, a political party or a trade union must be able to admit or expel members based on their political values and actions.<ref>e.g. ''[[ASLEF v UK]]'' [2007] ECHR 184, where the [[European Court of Human Rights]] held that a union, [[ASLEF]], could expel a member of the fascist group, the [[British National Party]], because it was committed to equality.</ref> The flip side of this is that common law recognises a right not to be unjustly excluded from an association. For instance in ''[[Nagle v Feilden]]'' a horse trainer, [[Florence Nagle]] successfully claimed that the [[Jockey Club]]'s refusal to grant her a training licence on grounds of her sex was unlawful.<ref>''[[Nagle v Feilden]]'' [1966] 2 QB 633</ref> Third, there is a right to act upon the goals of the association, for instance by campaigning for election as a political party, or as a trade union collectively bargaining with an employer for better wages or if necessary going on strike.<ref>cf ''[[RMT v United Kingdom]]'' [2014] ECHR 366, where the [[ECtHR]] held that although a union had the right to strike, and the UK's laws were at the outer limits (with Russia and Turkey) in restricting union freedoms, it was within the margin of appreciation to have restricting balloting rules, and possibly to limit [[secondary action]].</ref> UK law generally imposes no restriction on people forming groups for political purposes, with the significant exception of organisations banned under the [[Terrorism Act 2000]], such as the neo-Nazi white hate group [[National Action (UK)|National Action]] or [[Jihadi]] fundamentalists in [[Al Qaeda]].<ref>[[Terrorism Act 2000]] s 3 and Sch 2, with a growing list of banned organisations.</ref>

[[File:Extinction Rebellion London (46740878395).jpg|thumb|left|[[Extinction Rebellion]] protests in [[London]].]]
Like freedom of association,<ref>eg ''[[Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch]]'' [1941] UKHL 2 and ''[[Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co]]'' [1892] AC 25</ref> the right of peaceful assembly was recognised at [[common law]]. For instance, in ''[[Beatty v Gillbanks]]'' the [[Salvation Army]] wanted to march against alcohol but was stopped by the police over concerns that a rival 'skeleton army' of local brewers would violently disrupt them and so breach the beach. The court held that nobody could 'say that such an assembly [was] in itself an unlawful one' and said there was 'no authority' for saying anyone 'may be convicted for doing a lawful act'.<ref>(1882) 9 QBD 308, approved in ''[[Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions]]'' [2000] HRLR 249</ref> As [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] summarised in 1981, freedom of assembly "is the right for everyone to meet and assemble with his fellows to discuss their affairs and to promote their views".<ref>''[[Verrall v Great Yarmouth Borough Council]]'' [1981] 1 QB 202</ref> Any procession in the streets or highways is lawful,<ref>AL Goodhart, 'Public Meetings and Processions' (1937) 6 CLJ 161, 169</ref> although there is a duty to inform police 6 days in advance if it is to demonstrate for a cause.<ref>[[Public Order Act 1986]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/11 ss 11-16]. Police can impose conditions on duration and numbers, and may apply for a banning order but only if serious public disorder could not be controlled with conditions. In Scotland, the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 ss 62-64 requires 28 days notification.</ref> This said, in ''[[Kay v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' the House of Lords held that a regular cycling protest called [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] required no notification because under the [[Public Order Act 1986]] section 11(2) it was "commonly or customarily held" and it did not have a planned route.<ref>[2008] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/69.html UKHL 69]</ref> Although [[Highways Act 1980]] section 137 makes it an offence to obstruct a highway,<ref>[[Highways Act 1980]] s 137 is inconsistent with many other EU member state and Commonwealth country rules, see e.g. ''[[Eugen Schmidberger, Internationale Transporte und Planzüge v Austria]]'' (2003) C-112/00</ref> in ''[[DPP v Jones]]'' the House of Lords held that protestors who assembled on roads around [[Stonehenge]] despite police ordering them to disperse from a four-mile radius,<ref>[[Public Order Act 1980]] s 14A</ref> could not be lawfully arrested or convicted, because their occupation was 'not inconsistent with the primary right of the public to pass and repass.'<ref>[1999] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/5.html UKHL 5], [1999] 2 AC 240, a 3 to 2 decision.</ref> This established that peaceful meetings may be held on a [[Highways in England and Wales|highway]] so long as they do not restrict access by other road users.<ref>''[[DPP v Jones]]'' [1999] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/5.html 2 WLR 625]</ref> As well as rights to use public spaces, the law creates positive rights to use public property, such as school halls, for public political meetings.<ref>[[Representation of the People Act 1983]] ss 95-96, and case law such as ''[[Wheeler v Leicester CC]]'' [1985] AC 1054 and ''[[Webster v Southwark Council]]'' [1983] QB 698. But contrast the [[Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014]] s 59, that enables public space protection orders, requiring application for a public assembly.</ref>

Universities also have a special duty, imposed in 1986, to 'ensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for members... and for visiting speakers' and not denied use of premises based on their views or objectives.<ref>[[Education (No 2) Act 1986]] s 43</ref> This does not mean, however, that student societies cannot protest or that universities cannot prohibit speakers based on likely threats to property or good order.<ref>''[[R v University of Liverpool, ex p Caesar-Gordon]]'' [1987] PL 344, a university was not entitled to stop a talk by secretaries of the South African Embassy, from the apartheid government, because of fears about violence on the nearby [[Toxteth]] estate, but could have done if there was concern about 'disorder on university premises and among university members'.</ref> Anomalously it was held in ''[[Hubbard v Pitt]]'' that an estate agent might be able to sue a group of protestors in the tort of [[private nuisance]] for giving out leaflets and displaying placards opposed to it, on the ground that frustrated its business. Lord Denning MR dissented, and would have held the protestors used the highway reasonably, there was no nuisance at common law, and any picket was lawful if to obtain or communicate information for peaceful persuasion.<ref>''[[Hubbard v Pitt]]'' [1976] QB 142</ref> Whenever a picket is made in the "contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute" it is lawful,<ref>[[TULRCA 1992]] s 220. cf ''Broome v DPP [1974] AC 587, holding there was no right to stop traffic.</ref> so mushroom workers leafleting customers outside a supermarket to boycott their employers' mushrooms acted lawfully even though it caused the employers economic loss.<ref>''[[Middlebrook Mushrooms Ltd v TGWU]]'' [1993] ICR 612</ref>

The right to assembly does not yet extend to private property. In ''[[Appleby v UK]]'' the Court of Human Rights held there was no interference in [[ECHR article 11]] when the owners of a private shopping mall in [[Washington, Tyne and Wear]] excluded protestors collecting signatures to stop the loss of open space from their mall.<ref>[2003] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2003/222.html ECHR 222]</ref> Although UK law could provide more protection than the minimum European level, it does not, and makes it an offence under the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]] to enter 'any premises' without leave, or threaten violence to secure entry. For 'residential premises' it is also an offence to remain as a trespasser after being required to leave. Further, a law dating from 1875, still makes it an offence to 'wrongfully and without legal authority... watch and beset' premises.<ref>[[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] s 241, originally in the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 s 7. This fell into disuse, but was revived for miners' strike: Wallington (1985) 14 Industrial Law Journal 145.</ref> In ''[[R v Jones]]'', Jones entered a [[Royal Air Force]] base intending to damage military equipment during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], which was itself a [[Legality of the Iraq War|violation]] of [[international law]].<ref>See J Crawford, ''Brownlie's Principles of Public International Law'' (2019) ch 33</ref> The House of Lords held that it was no defence even if the invasion was itself unlawful in international law, and there was still a conspiracy to cause criminal damage in violation of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]] section 1.<ref>[2006] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/16.html UKHL 16], also [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] s 3(b)</ref>

The [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] also makes it an offence to trespass and reside, disrupt or quat on premises without the owner's consent.<ref>Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 ss 61-77, also [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] s 128.</ref> Genuine belief in the importance of the cause is no defence,<ref>''[[DPP v Bayer]]'' [2003] EWHC 2567</ref> and an injunction can be obtained for violations; however, in all of these offences the human right of freedom of assembly or expression of the protesters must be taken into account.<ref>On injunctions, see ''[[NWL Ltd v Woods]]'' [1979] ICR 867, 881, Lord Diplock, stating the test concerns 'the degree of likelihood the plaintiff would have succeeded in establishing his right to an injunction if the action had gone to trial, is a factor to be brought into the balance.' AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2018) chs 18, 501, where human rights are at stake, [[HRA 1998]] s 12 means that 'courts ought to give more weight to the respondent’s defence than might otherwise have been the case.'</ref> There are also four further significant public order offences. First, it is unlawful to [[riot]], where 12 or more people use or threaten unlawful violence.<ref>[[Public Order Act 1986]] s 1, with up to 10 years prison. The famous [[Riot Act 1714]] is now repealed, and the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1817]], which allowed police to disperse meetings lapsed. The [[Riot Compensation Act 2016]] entitles victims who suffer damage from rioting to compensation for uninsured property.</ref> Second, using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, including on signs, is an offence if this could make people believe they will suffer immediate unlawful violence,<ref>[[Public Order Act 1986]] s 4</ref> or if it causes or is likely to cause "harassment, alarm or distress."<ref>[[Public Order Act 1986]] s 4A-5</ref> Insults did not include anti-apartheid protests at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] that spectators resented,<ref>''[[Brutus v Cozens]]'' [1973] AC 854</ref> and did not include books, such as [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' where the immediacy of any result is lacking.<ref>''[[R v Horseferry Road Magistrate, ex p Siadatan]]'' [1991] 1 QB 260</ref> Third, harassment is an offence under the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]] section 4 if it causes someone to fear on two or more occasions that violence will be used against them.<ref>''[[Oxford University v Broughton]]'' [2004] EWHC 2543, injunctions against animal rights activists.</ref> Fourth, while [[breach of peace]] is not an offence itself, apprehension is grounds for arrest. This has included selling a [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] paper outside a football ground,<ref>''[[Alexander v Smith]]'' 1984 SLT 176</ref> and a homophobic preacher holding signs in Bournemouth saying 'Stop Immorality', 'Stop Homosexuality' and 'Stop Lesbianism'.<ref>''[[Hammond v Director of Public Prosecutions]]'' [2004] EWHC 69 (Admin)</ref>

Generally the police may arrest people who they honestly and reasonably think will risk a breach of the peace,<ref>eg ''[[Piddington v Bates]]'' [1960] 3 All ER 660, a police officer instructed at a trade dispute in a North London factory there should only be two pickets at each entrance. The appellant insisted on joining, and was arrested for obstruction. Divisional Court upheld the conviction, the restriction to 2 pickets was not unlawful and arbitrary. Lord Parker CJ, 'a police officer charged with the duty of preserving the Queen's peace must be left to take such steps as, on the evidence before him, he thinks are proper.' ''[[Moss v McLachlan]]'' [1985] IRLR 76, defendants were stopped at a motorway exit, suspected of travelling to attend a picket at a colliery. They refused to go back and were arrested for obstructing a police officer. Skinner J upheld convictions, saying provided officers 'honestly and reasonably form the opinion that there is a real risk of a breach of the peace in the sense that it is in close proximity both in place and time, then the conditions exist for reasonable preventive action including, if necessary, the measures taken in this case.'</ref> but in ''[[R (Laporte) v Gloucestershire Chief Constable]]'' the House of Lords held it was unlawful for police to stop a coach of demonstrators from travelling to [[RAF Fairford]] and turn it back to London. There was no evidence a breach of peace was imminent.<ref>[2006] UKHL 55</ref> It regarded freedom of assembly as a residual right which individuals are free to exercise so long as the law does not preclude them from doing so.<ref>''[[R (Laporte) v Chief Constable of Gloucestershire]]'' [2006] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/55.html UKHL 55], [34]</ref> By contrast, in ''[[Austin v United Kingdom]]'' the European Court of Human Rights held there was no breach of article 5, the right to liberty, when protestors were kettled in Oxford Circus without food or drink for 7 hours. They were held not to have been falsely imprisoned and the conduct was justified to stop breach of the peace. Arguments were not, however, made under article 11.<ref>''[[R (Hicks) v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' [2017] UKSC 9 holding arrests and release of protestors on the royal wedding day was not unlawful. Contrast AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2018) 515-6.</ref> This said, the police must use their 'operational discretion' at all times with regard to human rights.<ref>cf ''[[DB v PSI Chief Constable]]'' [2017] UKSC 7, [72] 'The area of discretion available to the police was also constrained by the positive obligation to protect the appellant’s article 8 rights'.</ref>

The right to respect for family life, for which there is no general right at common law,{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 13.04}} is qualified by the broad principle that the welfare of the child is paramount and [[Parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental rights]] must take second place.{{sfnp|Lester|Oliver|1997|loc=para. 113}} In [[Gillick v West Norfolk Area Health Authority]], Lord Scarman stated that "parental rights are derived from parental duty and exist only so long as they are needed for the protection of the person and property of the child", while [[Ian Fraser, Baron Fraser of Tullybelton|Lord Fraser]] said that "parental rights to control a child do not exist for the benefit of the parent".<ref>{{cite court | litigants = Gillick v West Norfolk Area Health Authority | vol = [1986] AC 112 | url = http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1985/7.html}}</ref> The effect of this is to allow state intervention in family life where justified in the interests of the child in question, and the [[Children Act 1989]] gives effect to this by providing a basis on which decisions relating to a child's welfare are made.{{sfnp|Lester|Oliver|1997|loc=para. 113}} Section 1 of the Act provides that a court must, when taking a decision with regard to a child, take into account the child's wishes and feelings.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 13.25}} Adoption is regulated by the [[Adoption and Children Act 2002]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 13.60}}

The enactment of the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998]] installed a [[minimum wage]] and the [[Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992]] provides access to [[social security]] benefits.{{sfnp|Lester|Oliver|1997|loc=para. 121}} There is no positive right to healthcare; the [[National Health Service Act 1977]] imposes a duty on the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] to provide "adequate" healthcare but the courts have not thus far been willing to enforce this duty.{{sfnp|Lester|Oliver|1997|loc=para. 121}}

===Torture and degrading treatment===
{{main|ECHR article 3}}
The common law recognises that every person's body is "inviolate".<ref>{{cite court | litigants = Collins v Willcock | vol = [1984] 1 WLR 1172}}</ref> Interference will constitute the offence of [[common assault]] and the tort of [[Battery (tort)|battery]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 8.03}} Under the criminal law, an individual cannot consent to actual bodily harm and the House of Lords held in [[R v Brown]] that acts of [[BDSM|sado-masochism]] committed in private between [[Consent (criminal law)|consenting adults]] did not give the author of the harm a valid defence in respect of his acts.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 8.04}} The [[Children Act 2004]] removed the defence of reasonable chastissement in respect of acts committed against children and [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment in schools]] was outlawed in the [[Education Act 1996]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=paras. 8.09-8.10}}

=== Enjoyment of possessions ===
{{main|Right to property}}
Protection against the arbitrary deprivation of property was recognised in the [[Magna Carta]] and is of key importance in the common law.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=paras. 18.01 and 18.04}} Protection of the right to own and enjoy property is found in the offence of [[Theft#Theft in English law|theft]], by [[intellectual property law]]s and by the principle that there can be no [[tax]]ation except that which is authorised by Parliament.{{sfnp|Lester|Oliver|1997|loc=para. 111}} The right to property is qualified by [[Compulsory purchase in England and Wales|compulsory purchase laws]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 18.18}}

In civil cases, a judge may grant an [[Anton Piller order]] authorising the search of premises and seizure of evidence without prior warning.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The order's purpose is to prevent the destruction of incriminating evidence, particularly in cases of alleged [[intellectual property infringement]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Freedom from discrimination===
{{main|Freedom from discrimination|United Kingdom employment equality law}}
The common law has not traditionally provided effective protection against [[discrimination]], refusing to find that slavery in the colonies was contrary to public policy and not interpreting the word "person" to include women.{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 17.06}} Due to the inadequacies of the common law in this area, Parliament enacted the [[Race Relations Act 1965]] and [[Race Relations Act 1968]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 17.09}} The [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]] was the first legislation to protect against discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status,{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 17.18}} while dismissal for pregnancy-related reasons is qualified as automatically [[Unfair dismissal in the United Kingdom|unfair dismissal]] under the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 17.25}} The principle of [[equal pay]] was brought in under the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=para. 17.36}} [[Racial discrimination]] was prohibited by the [[Race Relations Act 1976]] and [[disability discrimination]] by the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=paras. 17.44 and 17.65}} Discrimination on the grounds of religion and belief in the workplace and tertiary education was first regulated by the [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003]], sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace by the [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003]] and [[age discrimination]] in employment by the [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006]].{{sfnp|Clayton|Tomlinson|2009|loc=paras. 17.81, 17.92 and 17.104}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, the [[British government]] focused a lot of effort on measures to combat the activities of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) and [[Ulster loyalism#Paramilitary and vigilante groups|loyalist paramilitaries]] in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]]. In Northern Ireland, the government curtailed the [[civil liberties]] of all those, disproportionately from the Catholic [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] minority (as the UK government commissioned [[Stevens Inquiries]] concluded; "This included examination and analysis of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] records to determine whether both sides of the community were dealt with in equal measure. They were not."<ref>Stevens Enquiry 3, 17 April 2003, p. 11</ref>), who were [[internment|interned]] without trial, and violated the human rights of some.

The [[Republic of Ireland]] lodged a complaint against the [[British government]] for its alleged treatment of interned prisoners in Northern Ireland (ECHR Ireland v UK 1978). The [[European Court of Human Rights]] initially ruled that [[torture]] had been used, but on appeal amended the ruling to state that the techniques used, including [[sleep deprivation]], [[hooding]], stress postures, subjection to "[[white noise]]" and deprivation of food and drink, constituted "cruel and inhuman treatment", but fell short of torture, in a landmark 1978 case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 June 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518165108/http://www.worldii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/1.html |archive-date=18 May 2011 }}</ref>

===War on Terror===
Since 2001, the "[[War on Terror]]" has led to new human rights concerns. The most recent criticism has concerned the now repealed [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]], a response to a perceived increased threat of [[terrorism]]. This act allowed the [[house arrest]] of terrorism suspects where there was insufficient evidence to bring them to [[trial (law)|trial]], involving the derogation (opting-out) of human rights laws, through the imposition of [[control orders]]. This aspect of the Prevention of Terrorism Act was introduced because the detention without trial of nine foreigners at [[HM Prison Belmarsh]] under Part IV of the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was held to be unlawful under human rights legislation, by the House of Lords, in [[A and Others v. Secretary of State for the Home Department|A and Others v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2004)]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Both the above Acts have been criticised for the lack of parliamentary discussion; the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 went from introduction to [[Royal Assent]] in 32 days, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 in 17.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] has also been criticised as giving the government very wide-ranging power in an emergency.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

On 2 February 2005 Parliament's [[Joint Committee on Human Rights]] also suggested that the [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] might contravene Article 8 of the European Convention (the right to respect for private life) and Article 14 (the right to non-discrimination).<ref>{{Cite web|title=IDABC - Home|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/12090/20200210174143/https://ec.europa.eu/idabc/|access-date=2020-10-13|website=wayback.archive-it.org}}</ref>

In 2015, Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] introduced a Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, which was criticized by the civil liberties and human rights pressure group [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] because  'Sadly this Bill ignores reforms that could improve the effectiveness of investigations and prosecutions and continues the discredited trend of unnecessary and unjust blank cheque powers that have the potential to undermine long term security'.

===Internment===
{{Main|Internment}}
Following the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]], the [[Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was passed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Part 4 of the Act provided for the [[Indefinite detention without trial|indefinite detention without charge]] of foreign nationals certified by the Home Secretary as "suspected international terrorists" where such persons could not be deported on the grounds that they faced a real risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment if removed to their home country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Part 4 did not create new detention powers – under the [[Immigration Act 1971|1971 Immigration Act]], the Home Secretary has the power to detain a foreign national pending deportation. Instead, Part 4 removed a limitation on detention powers imposed by the requirements of Article 5(1)(f) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (which provided, among other things, that someone could only be detained for a short period prior to deportation). This was achieved by the British government derogating from the ECHR on the basis that the threat to the UK amounted to a 'public emergency threatening the life of the nation' within the meaning of Article 15.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

However, the use of immigration detention powers meant that, although the British government could not force them, the detainees were technically free to return (albeit facing a real risk of torture). However, 2 detainees did leave – one to [[France]] and one to [[Morocco]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 2002, the [[Special Immigration Appeals Commission]] held that indefinite detention under Part 4 was incompatible with the right to non-discrimination under Article 14 ECHR, on the basis that only suspected terrorists who were foreign nationals were subjected to detention, while suspects who were British nationals remained free. However, SIAC's declaration of Part 4's incompatibility with Article 14 was quashed by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In December 2004, the House of Lords held 8-1 that Part 4 was incompatible with both Article 5 and Article 14 ECHR on the basis that indefinite detention was both a disproportionate measure notwithstanding the seriousness of the terrorist threat, as well as discriminatory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Following the judgment, the government moved to introduce control orders as an (highly controversial) alternative measure. It was secured by the passing of the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}, now repealed.

As per immigration policy documents from the Foreign Office, reviewed by [[The Guardian]], the Downing Street sought advice on emulating the Australian offshore detention system model. Immigration policy experts warn that implementing the policy would create a fresh “human rights disaster”. Reportedly, dozens of people have died in the [[Immigration detention in Australia|Australian detention]] network, while thousands of others have sustained mental trauma and self harm. The Australian government has been ordered in the past to pay a compensation of $70 million to about 2,000 detainees, following the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/01/uk-offshore-detention-proposal-could-create-human-rights-disaster-australian-experts-warn|title=UK offshore detention proposal could create 'human rights disaster', Australian experts warn|accessdate=1 October 2020|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

===Human trafficking===
{{main|Human trafficking in the United Kingdom}}
There has been a growing awareness of human trafficking as a human rights issue in the UK, in particular the trafficking of women and under-age girls into the UK for [[forced prostitution]]. A particular high-profile case resulted in the conviction of five [[Albania]]ns who 'trafficked' a 16-year-old [[Lithuania]]n girl and forced her into prostitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4287432.stm|title=Baltic girls forced into sex slavery|date=28 November 2005|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> According to [[Home Office]] figures, there are over 1,000 cases of trafficking each year. Under pressure from organisations such as [[Amnesty International]], the UK government has recently signed the [[Trafficking in human beings#Council of Europe|Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=10314|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621123908/http://amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=10314|url-status=dead|title=Protect victims of trafficking in the UK|archive-date=21 June 2006|website=amnesty.org.uk}}</ref><ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGIOR300032005 Council of Europe: Protect victims of people trafficking | Amnesty International<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524110555/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGIOR300032005 |date=24 May 2006 }}</ref><ref>Home Office, [http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news/convention-against-trafficking Home Secretary signs vital anti-trafficking convention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417013110/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news/convention-against-trafficking |date=17 April 2008 }}, 23 March 2007, accessed 25 July 2007</ref>

===Child spies===
In July 2018, a committee of the [[House of Lords]] revealed that British police and intelligence agencies are using children as [[espionage|spies]] in covert operations against terrorists, gangs and drug dealers. The committee raised alarm over government plans to give law enforcement bodies more freedom over their use of children. Some of the child spies are aged under 16.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/19/british-intelligence-uses-child-spies-in-covert-operations|title=UK intelligence and police using child spies in covert operations|author1=Damien Gayle|author2=Ian Cobain|date=19 July 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Parliament's joint committee on human rights has been asked to investigate the use of child spies by the police and security services. [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], the former Brexit secretary, [[Diane Abbott]], the shadow home secretary, and a number of human rights groups have criticized the practice of using children as spies.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/07/uk-human-rights-panel-to-investigate-police-use-of-child-spies|title=UK human rights panel to investigate police use of child spies|first=Damien|last=Gayle|date=7 August 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

===Domestic Abuse===
On 8 June 2020, HRW urged the UK Government to fill the loopholes in the “Domestic Abuse Bill”, which does not include measures to protect all women and girls. The plea came following a rampant rise in domestic abuse during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/08/uk-failing-domestic-abuse-victims-pandemic|title= UK Failing Domestic Abuse Victims in Pandemic |accessdate=8 June 2020|website=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>

==European Court of Human Rights cases==
By the end of 2010, the European Court of Human Rights had, in 271 cases, found violations of the European Convention of Human Rights by the United Kingdom.[4].{{sfnp|Pannick|Lester|2004|loc=para. 1.02}} These judgments cover a wide variety of areas, from the rights of prisoners to trade union activities. The decisions have also had a profound effect and influence on the approach adopted by the UK to the regulation of activities which could potentially engage Convention rights. As one author has noted, "[t]here is hardly an area of state regulation untouched by standards which have emerged from the application of Convention provisions to situations presented by individual applicants."<ref>{{cite book | last = Jacobs | first = F.G. | author-link = Francis Geoffrey Jacobs |author2=White, C.A. | title = The European Convention on Human Rights | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1996 | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-826242-8 | page = 406 }}</ref>

Notable cases involving violations of the Convention include:

* Criminal sanctions for private consensual homosexual conduct ([[Dudgeon v. United Kingdom|Dudgeon, 1981]]);
* Refusal to legally recognise [[transsexual]]s (Rees, 1986);

* Shooting of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] suspects in [[Gibraltar]] without any attempt to arrest them ([[Daniel McCann|McCann]], 1995);
* Killing of a prisoner by another mentally ill detainee with whom he was sharing a cell (Edwards, 2002);
* Investigation of an unlawful killing by police officers conducted by the police officers who participated in the killing (McShane, 2002);
* Failure to protect a child from ill-treatment at the hands of his stepfather (A, 1998);
* Failure by a local authority to take sufficient measures in the case of severe neglect and abuse of children by their parents over several years (Z, 2001);
* Ineffective monitoring of a young prisoner who committed suicide during a short sentence (Keenan, 2001);
* Keeping a disabled person in dangerously cold conditions without access to a toilet (Price, 2001);
* Granting of an injunction against the [[Sunday Times]] for publishing an article on the effects of [[thalidomide]] (Sunday Times, 1979);
* Injunction against the Sunday Times for publishing extracts from the [[Spycatcher]] novel (Sunday Times (no. 2), 1991);
* Ordering a journalist to disclose his sources (Goodwin, 1996);
* Agreement obliging employees to join a certain trade union in order to keep their jobs (Young, 1981);
* Keeping a database of [[DNA]] samples taken from individuals arrested, but later acquitted or have the charges against them dropped ([[S. and Marper v. The United Kingdom|Marper, 2008]]);
* Forcing individuals to [[Workfare in the United Kingdom|work for private companies without pay]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/12/graduate-poundland-government-work-schemes|title=Graduate's Poundland victory leaves government work schemes in tatters|first=Shiv|last=Malik|date=12 February 2013|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> under threat of having their [[social security]] payments stopped ([[R (Reilly) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Reilly, 2012]], leading to the passing of the [[Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act 2013]] as an [[ex post facto law]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-28158483|title=Court challenges UK work schemes|date=4 July 2014|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> itself also criticised for violating human rights treaties<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/the-queen-on-the-application-of-reilly-no-2-and-hewstone-v-the-secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions/|title=The Queen on the application of Reilly (No. 2) and Hewstone -v- The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|website=www.judiciary.uk}}</ref>).

==Human rights organisations==
There are three [[national human rights institutions]] in the UK, each with specific jurisdiction and functions. All three are accredited with 'A' status by the [[International Co-ordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions|International Co-ordinating Committee of NHRIs]], and all participate in the [[European Group of National Human Rights Institutions|European Group of NHRIs]], in both cases sharing one (United Kingdom) vote.
* The first such body to be created was the [[Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission]] (NIHRC, www.nihrc.org) was set up in 1999, under the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] which implemented elements of the [[Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement]]; its powers were strengthened by the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007. The Commission is mandated to promote and protect human rights in Northern Ireland through advising on legislation and policy, providing legal assistance to individuals, intervening in litigation, conducting litigation in its own name, publications, research, investigations, monitoring compliance with international standards, and education and training. 
* The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC, www.equalityhumanrights.com) deals with anti-discrimination and equality issues in England, Scotland and Wales, and with human rights issues in England and Wales, and certain human rights issues in Scotland (those not devolved to the [[Scottish Parliament]]).
* The [[Scottish Human Rights Commission]] (SHRC, www.scottishhumanrights.com) was established by The Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006 (Scottish Parliament), and became fully operational on 10 December 2008, Human Rights Day, and the 60th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Commission is mandated to promote and protect human rights in Scotland in relation to civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, through publications, research, inquiries, advice, monitoring, legal intervention and education and training.
