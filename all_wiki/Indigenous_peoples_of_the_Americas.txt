The '''indigenous peoples of the Americas''' are the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] peoples of [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] and their descendants.

Although some [[indigenous peoples]] of the [[Americas]] were traditionally [[hunter-gatherer]]s—and many, especially in the [[Amazon basin]], still are—many groups practiced [[aquaculture]] and [[agriculture]]. The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas.<ref name="mann">{{cite book|last=Mann |first=Charles C. |author-link=Charles C. Mann |year=2005 |title=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus |location=New York |publisher=Knopf Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-4000-4006-3|oclc=56632601|title-link=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus}}</ref> Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture, others practiced a mix of farming, hunting and gathering. In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture, large-scale organized cities, city-states, [[chiefdom]]s, [[State (polity)|states]], [[Realm|kingdoms]] and [[empire]]s. Some had varying degrees of knowledge of engineering, architecture, mathematics, astronomy, writing, physics, medicine, planting and irrigation, geology, mining, sculpture and goldsmithing.

Many parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous peoples; some countries have sizable populations, especially [[Bolivia]], [[Canada]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]] and the [[United States]]. At least a thousand different [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] are spoken in the Americas. Some, such as the [[Quechuan languages]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Guarani language|Guaraní]], [[Mayan languages]] and [[Nahuatl]], count their speakers in millions. Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees, including religion, [[social organization]] and [[Subsistence economy|subsistence]] practices. Like most cultures, over time, cultures specific to many indigenous peoples have evolved to incorporate traditional aspects but also cater to modern needs. Some indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from [[Western culture]] and a few are still counted as [[uncontacted peoples]].

==Terminology==
Application of the term "[[Native American name controversy#"Indian" and "American Indian" (1492–)|Indian]]" originated with [[Christopher Columbus]], who, in his search for India, thought that he had arrived in the [[East Indies]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cp0r3aa8EM8C&q=indian+%22in+dios%22+wilton&pg=PA163|title=Word myths: debunking linguistic urban legends|first=David|last=Wilton|page=163|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-517284-3|date=2004-12-02|accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1966/does-indian-derive-from-columbuss-description-of-native-americans-as-una-gente-in-dios|title=Does "Indian" derive from Columbus's description of Native Americans as "una gente in Dios"?|date=2001-10-25|first=Cecil|last=Adams|author-link=Cecil Adams|website=[[The Straight Dope]]|accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Biggest Misnomer of All Time?|url=http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/2015/|date=2009-10-12|first=Ben|last=Zimmer|author-link=Ben Zimmer|publisher=VisualThesaurus}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Hoxie |first= Frederick E. |title= Encyclopedia of North American Indians |year= 1996 |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn= 978-0-395-66921-1 |page= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofno00hoxi/page/568 568] |url= https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofno00hoxi/page/568 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Herbst|first=Philip|title=The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States|year=1997|publisher=Intercultural Press|isbn=978-1-877864-97-1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UiZQH5gHuggC&pg=PA116|page= 116}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Discourse Analysis as Sociocriticism : The Spanish Golden Age|first=Antonio|last=Gómez-Moriana|chapter=The Emerging of a Discursive Instance:Columbus and the invention of the "Indian"|pages=[https://archive.org/details/discourseanalysi0000gome/page/124 124–32]|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|date=1993-05-12|isbn=978-0-8166-2073-9|accessdate=4 July 2011|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BCpLZfypTIC&q=columbus+indios+indian&pg=PA124|url=https://archive.org/details/discourseanalysi0000gome/page/124}}</ref> Eventually, those islands came to be known as the "[[West Indies]]," a name still used. This led to the blanket term "Indies" and "Indians" ({{lang-es|indios}}; {{lang-pt|índios}}; {{lang-fr|indiens}}; {{lang-nl|indianen}}) for the indigenous inhabitants, which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion and politics, was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of indigenous peoples themselves, but has since been embraced or tolerated by many over the last two centuries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grey|first=C.G.P.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh88fVP2FWQ|title='Indian' or 'Native American'?

The Métis people of Canada can be contrasted, for instance, to the American Indian-European mixed race [[mestizos]] (or {{lang|pt|[[caboclos]]}} in Brazil) of [[Hispanic America]] who, with their larger population (in most Latin-American countries constituting either outright majorities, pluralities, or at the least large minorities), identify largely as a new ethnic group distinct from both Europeans and Indigenous Americans, but still considering themselves a subset of the European-derived [[Hispanidad|Hispanic]] or [[Brazilians|Brazilian peoplehood]] in culture and ethnicity ([[cf.]] {{lang|es|[[Ladino people|ladinos]]}}).

Among [[Spanish-speaking countries]], {{lang|es|indígenas}} or {{lang|es|pueblos indígenas}} ('indigenous peoples') is a common term, though {{lang|es|nativos}} or {{lang|es|pueblos nativos}} ('native peoples') may also be heard; moreover, {{lang|es|aborigen}} ('aborigine') is used in [[Argentina]] and {{lang|es|pueblos originarios}} ('original peoples') is common in [[Chile]]. In Brazil, {{lang|pt|indígenas}} or {{lang|pt|povos indígenas}} ('indigenous peoples') are common of formal-sounding designations, while {{lang|pt|índio}} ('Indian') is still the more often-heard term (the noun for the South-Asian nationality being {{lang|pt|indiano}}). {{lang|pt|Aborígene}} and {{lang|pt|nativo}} is rarely used in Brazil in Amerindian-specific contexts (e.g. {{lang|pt|aborígene}} is usually understood as the ethnonym for [[Indigenous Australians]]). The Spanish and Portuguese equivalents to Indian, nevertheless, could be used to mean any [[hunter-gatherer]] or full-blooded Indigenous person, particularly to continents other than Europe or Africa—for example, {{lang|es|[[Filipinos#Hispanized caste system|indios filipinos]]}}.

===Native American name controversy===
{{Main|Native American name controversy}}
The Native American name controversy<ref>{{cite book|title=The Return of the Native: American Indian Political Resurgence|isbn=0-19-503772-3|last1=Cornell|first1=Stephen|year=1988}}</ref> relates to the dispute over acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and to broad subsets thereof, such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes.<ref>{{cite book|title=1491. New Revelations of the Americas before Columbus|isbn=978-1-4000-3205-1|last1=Mann|first1=Charles C.|year=2006}}</ref> Early settlers often adopted terms that some tribes used for each other, not realizing these were derogatory terms used by enemies. When discussing broader subsets of peoples, naming may be based on shared language, region, or historical relationship.<ref>{{cite book|title=Language History, Language Change, and Languas Relationship|isbn=978-3-11-060969-1|last1=Hock|first1=Hans Henrich|last2=Joseph|first2=Brian D.|date=22 July 2019}}</ref> Many English [[exonyms]] have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Some of these names were based on foreign-language terms used by earlier explorers and colonists, while others resulted from the colonists' attempts to translate or transliterate [[endonyms]] from the native languages. Other terms arose during periods of conflict between the colonizers and indigenous peoples.<ref>{{cite book|title=Contributions to Sino-Tibetan Studies|isbn=90-04-07850-9|last1=McCoy|first1=John F.|last2=Light|first2=Timothy|year=1986}}</ref>

Since the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about how they want to be addressed, pushing to suppress use of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or [[racism|racist]]. During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the [[Indian rights movement]], the [[United States government]] responded by proposing the use of the term "[[Native American name controversy|Native American]]," to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1017/S0010417502000026], The Production of Legal Identities Proper to States: The Case of the Permanent Family Surname</ref> As may be expected among people of different cultures, not all Native Americans/American Indians agree on its use. No single group naming convention has been accepted by all indigenous peoples. Most prefer to be addressed as people of their tribe or nations when not speaking about Native Americans/American Indians as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|title=1491.

The data indicated that the individual was closely related to present North American Native American populations. But, the DNA was ancestral to present-day South American and Central American Native American populations. The implication is that there was an early divergence between North American indigenous peoples and those of Central and South America.  Ruled out were hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas.<ref name="Rasmussen2014"/> After study, the remains were returned to Montana for burial by Native Americans.

Similarly, the skeleton of a teenage girl (named '[[Naia (skeleton)|Naia]]' after a water nymph from Greek mythology) was found in 2007 in the underwater caves called ''[[sistema Sac Actun]]'' in [[Mexico]]'s eastern [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. DNA was extracted and dated. The skeleton was found to be 13,000 years old, and it is considered the oldest genetically intact human skeleton ever found in the Americas. The DNA indicates she was from a lineage derived from East Asian origins and also represented in the DNA of the modern native population.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-16/13000-year-old-skeleton-found-in-mexican-cave/5456472 "13,000-year-old skeleton found in Mexican cave oldest ever uncovered in the Americas: study"], [[ABC Online]], 16 May 2014</ref>

The remains of two infants found at the [[Upward Sun River site]] have been dated to 11,500 years ago. They show that all Native Americans descended from a single founding population that initially split from East Asians around 36,000 years ago. They also show that the basal northern and southern Native American branches, to which all other indigenous Americans belong, diverged around 16,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal

The European colonization of the Americas fundamentally changed the lives and cultures of the resident Indigenous peoples. Although the exact pre-colonization population-count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Indigenous populations diminished by between 80% and 90% within the first centuries of European colonization. The majority of these losses are attributed to the introduction of Afro-Eurasian diseases into the Americas. Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[cholera]], which the early colonists brought from Europe.

The spread of infectious diseases was slow initially, as most Europeans were not actively or visibly infected, due to inherited immunity from generations of exposure to these diseases in Europe. This changed when the Europeans began the [[human trafficking]] of massive numbers of [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Western and Central African people]] to the Americas. Like the Native Americans, these African people, newly exposed to European diseases, lacked any inherited resistances to the diseases of Europe.

There are many factors as to why Native Americans suffered such immense losses from Afro-Eurasian diseases. Many European diseases, like cow pox, are acquired from domesticated animals that are not indigenous to the Americas. European populations had adapted to these diseases, and built up resistance, over many generations. Many of the European diseases that were brought over to the Americas were diseases, like [[yellow fever]], that were relatively manageable if infected as a child, but were deadly if infected as an adult. Children could often survive the disease, resulting in immunity to the disease for the rest of their lives. But contact with adult populations without this childhood or inherited immunity would result in these diseases proving fatal.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/goodling.html |title= Stacy Goodling, "Effects of European Diseases on the Inhabitants of the New World" |publisher= Millersville.edu |accessdate= 23 May 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080510163413/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/goodling.html |archive-date= 10 May 2008 }}</ref>

The re-introduction of the [[horse]], extinct in the Americas for over 7500 years, had a profound impact on [[horse culture|Native American culture]] in the [[Great Plains]] of North America and in [[Patagonia]] in South America. By domesticating horses, some tribes had great success: horses enabled them to expand their territories, exchange more goods with neighboring tribes, and more easily capture [[game (hunting)|game]], especially [[bison]].

IHT is a difficult term to standardize and measure because of the vast and variable diversity of indigenous people and their communities. Therefore, it is an arduous task to assign an [[operational definition]] and systematically collect data when studying IHT. Many of the studies that incorporate IHT measure it in different ways, making it hard to compile data and review it holistically. This is an important point that provides context for the following studies that attempt to understand the relationship between IHT and potential adverse health impacts.

Some of the methodologies to measure IHT include a “Historical Losses Scale" (HLS), "Historical Losses Associated Symptoms Scale" (HLASS), and residential school ancestry studies.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|23}} HLS uses a survey format that includes “12 kinds of historical losses,” such as loss of language and loss of land and asks participants how often they think about those losses.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|23}} The HLASS includes 12 emotional reactions and asks participants how they feel when they think about these losses.<ref name=":1" /> Lastly, the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] ancestry studies ask respondents if their parents, grandparents, great-grandparents or “elders from their community” went to a residential school to understand if family or community history in residential schools are associated with negative health outcomes.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|25}} In a comprehensive review of the research literature, Joseph Gone and colleagues<ref name=":1" /> compiled and compared outcomes for studies using these IHT measures relative to health outcomes of indigenous peoples. The study defined negative health outcomes to include such concepts as anxiety, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, polysubstance abuse, [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], depression, [[Binge eating|binge-eating]], anger, and sexual abuse.<ref name=":1" />

The connection between IHT and health conditions is complicated because of the difficult nature of measuring IHT, the unknown directionality of IHT and health outcomes, and because the term ''indigenous people'' used in the various samples comprises a huge population of individuals with drastically different experiences and histories. That being said, some studies such as Bombay, Matheson, and Anisman (2014),<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bombay|first1=Amy|last2=Matheson|first2=Kimberly|last3=Anisman|first3=Hymie|date=2013-09-24|title=The intergenerational effects of Indian Residential Schools: Implications for the concept of historical trauma|journal=Transcultural Psychiatry|language=en-US|volume=51|issue=3|pages=320–338|doi=10.1177/1363461513503380|issn=1363-4615|pmc=4232330|pmid=24065606}}</ref> Elias et al.

Natives of North America began practicing [[farming]] approximately 4,000 years ago, late in the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] period of North American cultures. Technology had advanced to the point where pottery had started to become common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic [[Native American use of fire|Indians began using fire]] in a controlled manner. They carried out intentional burning of vegetation to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories. It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important both for food and for medicines.<ref name="Owen2002">{{cite web|url= http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/sustain/report/terra2/terra2.htm|title= Chapter 2 (TERRA–2): The History of Native Plant Communities in the South|last= Owen|first= Wayne|year=2002|work= Southern Forest Resource Assessment Final Report|publisher= U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Research Station|accessdate= 29 July 2008}}</ref>

In the [[Mississippi River]] valley, Europeans noted that Native Americans managed groves of [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]- and [[fruit tree|fruit-tree]]s not far from villages and towns and their gardens and agricultural fields. They would have used [[Controlled burn|prescribed burning]] further away, in forest and prairie areas.<ref name="Lentz2000">{{cite book|title= Imperfect balance: landscape transformations in the Precolumbian Americas|url= https://archive.org/details/imperfectbalance00lent|url-access= limited|editor= David L.

Many crops first domesticated by indigenous Americans are now produced and used globally, most notably [[maize]] (or "corn") arguably the most important crop in the world.<ref>[[Michael Pollan]], ''The Omnivore's Dilemma''</ref> Other significant crops include [[cassava]]; [[Salvia hispanica|chia]]; [[squash (plant)|squash]] (pumpkins, zucchini, [[marrow (vegetable)|marrow]], [[acorn squash]], [[butternut squash]]); the [[pinto bean]], ''[[Phaseolus]]'' beans including most [[common bean]]s, [[tepary bean]]s and [[lima bean]]s; [[tomato]]es; [[potato]]es; [[avocado]]s; [[peanut]]s; [[cocoa bean]]s (used to make [[chocolate]]); [[vanilla]]; [[strawberries]]; [[pineapple]]s; [[Capsicum|peppers]] (species and varieties of ''[[Capsicum]]'', including [[bell pepper]]s, [[jalapeño]]s, [[paprika]] and [[chili pepper]]s); [[sunflower|sunflower seeds]]; [[rubber]]; [[brazilwood]]; [[chicle]]; [[tobacco]]; [[coca]]; [[manioc]], [[blueberries]], [[Cranberry|cranberries]], and some species of [[cotton]].

Studies of contemporary indigenous environmental management—including of agro-forestry practices among [[Itza people|Itza]] [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in Guatemala and of hunting and fishing among the [[Menominee]] of Wisconsin—suggest that longstanding "sacred values" may represent a summary of sustainable millennial traditions.<ref>

=== Animals ===
Indigenous Americans also domesticated some animals, such as [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, and [[guinea-pig]]s.

==Culture==
{{Further|Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America}}

[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], [[Cuzco Region]], [[Peru]]]]

Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where distinct ethnic groups adopting shared cultural traits, similar technologies, and social organizations. An example of such a [[cultural area]] is [[Mesoamerica]], where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of [[nomad]]ic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Indigenous languages of the Americas}}
The languages of the North American Indians have been classified into 56 groups or stock tongues, in which the spoken languages of the tribes may be said to centre. In connection with speech, reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area.
Of equal interest is the picture writing especially well developed among the [[Ojibwe language|Chippewas]] and [[Lenape|Delawares]].<ref>Hammerton, J.A., Peoples of All Nations, Volume 7, London: Educational Book Co., Limited, 17, New Bridge Street, E.C</ref>

===Writing systems===
{{see also|Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cherokee syllabary|Quipu}}
[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], [[Mexico]]]]
The development of [[writing]] is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the [[Mesoamerica]]n region produced several [[Mesoamerican writing systems|indigenous writing systems]] beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the [[Cascajal Block]]. The [[Olmec]] hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] began to wane.<ref>{{cite web |last=Skidmore|first=Joel|title= The Cascajal Block: The Earliest Precolumbian Writing|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/reports/Cascajal.pdf|year= 2006|pages= 1–4|publisher= Mesoweb Reports & News|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>

The [[Maya script|Maya writing system]] was a combination of [[phonetic]] [[syllabary|syllabic]] symbols and [[logogram]]s—that is, it was a [[logosyllabic]] writing system. It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the [[spoken language]] of its community. In total, the script has more than one thousand different [[glyph]]s, although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning, and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Coe, Michael D. |author-link=Michael D.

The [[Zapotec script|Zapotec writing system]] is one of the earliest writing systems in the Americas.<ref name="ReferenceA">Urcid Javier, 2005; La Escritura zapoteca</ref> The oldest example of the Zapotec script is a monument discovered in [[San José Mogote]], dating from around from 600 BCE.<ref>Flannery and Marcus, 2003</ref> Zapotec writing was [[logogram|logographic]] and presumably [[syllabary|syllabic]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The remains of the Zapotec writing system are present in the monumental architecture. There are only a few extant inscriptions, making study of this writing system difficult.

[[Aztec codices]] (singular ''[[codex]]'') are books written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era [[Aztec]]s. These codices provide some of the best [[primary sources]] for [[Aztec society|Aztec culture]]. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.<ref>Elizabeth Hill Boone, "Pictorial Documents and Visual Thinking in Postconquest Mexico". p. 158.</ref> The colonial era codices contain not only [[Aztec writing|Aztec pictograms]], but also [[Classical Nahuatl]] (in the [[Latin alphabet]]), Spanish, and occasionally [[Latin]].

Spanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in Latin letters, and there are a large number of local-level documents in [[Nahuatl]], [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], and Yucatec [[Mayan languages|Maya]] from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.<ref>Frances Karttunen, "Nahuatl Literacy", in George A. Collier et al, eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States'', New York: Academic Press 1982, pp. 395–417.</ref> The Spanish crown gathered such documentation, and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the [[New Philology]] to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints.<ref>James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref>

The [[Wiigwaasabak]], [[birch bark]] scrolls on which the [[Ojibwa]] ([[Anishinaabe]]) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics]].

Aboriginal syllabic writing, or simply '''syllabics''', is a family of [[abugida]]s used to write some Aboriginal Canadian languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Inuit]], and [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] language families.

===Music and art===

[[Native American music]] can vary between cultures, however there are significant commonalities. Traditional music often centers around [[drum]]ming and singing. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s, [[clapper stick]]s, and rasps are also popular percussive instruments, both historically and in contemporary cultures. [[Flute]]s are made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The [[Apache]] have a type of [[Apache fiddle|fiddle]], and [[fiddle]]s are also found among a number of [[First Nations]] and [[Métis]] cultures.

The music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America, like that of the North American cultures, tend to be spiritual ceremonies. It traditionally includes a large variety of percussion and [[wind instrument]]s such as drums, flutes, sea shells (used as trumpets) and "rain" tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600–900 CE); this jar was decorated with imagery depicting a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European [[musical instrument]]s; when played, it produces a sound that mimics a jaguar's growl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420123834/http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html|date=2004-04-17|archive-date=2015-04-20|accessdate=2016-06-22|title=Music from the Land of the Jaguar|publisher=The Princeton Art Museum}} (Includes sound sample.) {{Dead link|date=May 2017}}</ref>

{{Main|Greenlandic Inuit}}
The Greenlandic Inuit ([[Kalaallisut]]{{dn|date=October 2020}}: ''kalaallit'', [[Tunumiisut]]: ''tunumiit'', [[Inuktun]]: ''inughuit'') are the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and most populous ethnic group in [[Greenland]].<ref>[https://www.iwgia.org/en/greenland Indigenous peoples in Greenland] at the [[International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs]]</ref> This means that [[Denmark]] has one officially recognized [[Indigenous group]]. the [[Inuit]] - the [[Greenlandic Inuit]] of Greenland and the [[Greenlandic people in Denmark]] (Inuit residing in Denmark).

Approximately 89 percent of Greenland's population of 57,695 is Greenlandic [[Inuit]], or 51,349 people {{as of|2012|lc=on}}.<ref name=cia>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pe.html "People and Society: Peru."] ''CIA – The World Factbook''.

* the [[Kalaallit]] of west Greenland, who speak [[West Greenlandic|Kalaallisut]]
* the [[Tunumiit]] of [[Tunu]] (east Greenland), who speak [[Tunumiit language|Tunumiit oraasiat]] ("East Greenlandic")
* the [[Inughuit]] of north Greenland, who speak [[Inuktun]] ("Polar Inuit")

==== Mexico ====
{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Mexico}}
[[File:Huichol indian.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Huichol people|Wixarika (Huichol)]] woman from Zacatecas]]
The territory of modern-day [[Mexico]] was home to numerous indigenous civilizations prior to the arrival of the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]es'': The [[Olmec]]s, who flourished from between 1200 BCE to about 400 BCE in the coastal regions of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] and the [[Mixtec]]s, who held sway in the mountains of [[Oaxaca]] and the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]; the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in the [[Yucatán]] (and into neighbouring areas of contemporary [[Central America]]); the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] in present-day [[Michoacán]] and surrounding areas, and the [[Aztec]]s/[[Mexica]], who, from their central capital at [[Tenochtitlan]], dominated much of the centre and south of the country (and the non-Aztec inhabitants of those areas) when [[Hernán Cortés]] first landed at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]].

In contrast to what was the general rule in the rest of North America, the history of the colony of [[New Spain]] was one of racial intermingling (''mestizaje''). ''[[Mestizo]]s'', which in Mexico designate people who do not identify culturally with any indigenous grouping, quickly came to account for a majority of the colony's population; but 6% of the Mexican population identify as speakers of one of the indigenous languages. The [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples|CDI]] identifies 62 indigenous groups in Mexico, each with a unique language.<ref>[http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/257.pdf Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611011220/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/257.pdf |date=11 June 2008 }} (PDF).</ref>

In the states of [[Chiapas]] and [[Oaxaca]] and in the interior of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] the majority of the population is indigenous. Large indigenous minorities, including [[Aztecs]] or [[Nahua people|Nahua]], [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]]s, [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], and [[Mixtec]]s are also present in the central regions of Mexico. In Northern Mexico indigenous people are a small minority.

The [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples]] grants all indigenous languages spoken in Mexico, regardless of the number of speakers, the same validity as Spanish in all territories in which they are spoken, and indigenous peoples are entitled to request some [[public services]] and documents in their native languages.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas (General Law of the Rights of the Indigenous Peoples) |work=CDI México |url=http://cdi.gob.mx/derechos/vigencia/2006_ley_general_derechos_linguisticos_pueblos_indigenas.pdf |accessdate=2 October 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070925193420/http://cdi.gob.mx/derechos/vigencia/2006_ley_general_derechos_linguisticos_pueblos_indigenas.pdf |archive-date=25 September 2007 |language=es}}</ref> Along with Spanish, the law has granted them—more than 60 languages—the status of "national languages". The law includes all indigenous languages of the Americas regardless of origin; that is, it includes the indigenous languages of ethnic groups non-native to the territory. The [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]] recognizes the language of the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], who immigrated from the United States,<ref>{{cite web |title=Kikapúes&nbsp;— Kikaapoa |work=CDI México |url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=291 |accessdate=2 October 2007}}</ref> and recognizes the languages of the [[Guatemala]]n indigenous refugees.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aguacatecos, cakchiqueles, ixiles, kekchíes, tecos y quichés |work=CDI México |url=http://cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=1378 |accessdate=2 October 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232909/http://cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=1378 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=2007-09-26}}</ref> The Mexican government has promoted and established bilingual primary and [[secondary education]] in some indigenous rural communities. Nonetheless, of the indigenous peoples in Mexico, only about 67% of them (or 5.4% of the country's population) speak an indigenous language and about a sixth do not speak Spanish (1.2% of the country's population).<ref>{{cite web |title=Poblicación de 5 años y más por Entidad Federativa, sexo y grupos lengüa indígena quinquenales de edad, y su distribución según condición de habla indígena y habla española |work=INEGI, México |url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00li01.pdf |accessdate=13 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102103605/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00li01.pdf |archive-date=2 January 2008}}</ref>

Indigenous peoples in what is now the [[Continental United States|contiguous United States]], including their descendants, were commonly called "American Indians", or simply "Indians" domestically. Since the late 20th century, when some{{who|date=February 2018}} insisted on using "Native American", as their preferred term, the [[United States Census Bureau]] and other parts of government have also adopted it. In Alaska, indigenous peoples belong to 11 cultures with 11 languages. These include the [[St. Lawrence Island Yupik]], [[Iñupiat]], [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]], [[Yup'ik]], [[Cup'ik]], [[Unangax]], [[Alutiiq]], [[Eyak]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tsimshian]], and [[Tlingit]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Education and Programs: Traditional Territories of Alaska Native Cultures|url=http://www.alaskanative.net/en/main-nav/education-and-programs/cultures-of-alaska/|website=Alaskan Native Heritage Center Museum|accessdate=8 November 2015|location=Anchorage, AK}}</ref> and are collectively called [[Alaska Natives]]. They include Native American peoples as well as Inuit, who are distinct but occupy areas of the region. 

The United States has authority with Indigenous [[Polynesia|Polynesian peoples]], which include [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]], [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]], [[Samoan people|Samoan]], [[Tahitian people|Tahitian]], and [[Demographics of Tonga|Tongan]]; politically they are classified as [[Pacific Islands American]]. They are geographically, genetically, and culturally distinct from indigenous peoples of the mainland continents of the Americas.

A total of 5.2&nbsp;million people identified as Native Americans, either alone or in combination with one or more ethnicity or other races.<ref name="uscensus"/> Tribes have established their own criteria for membership, which are often based on [[blood quantum]], [[lineal descent]], or residency. A minority of Native Americans live in land units called [[Indian reservation]]s. 

Some California and Southwestern tribes, such as the [[Kumeyaay]], [[Cocopa]], [[Pascua Yaqui]], [[Tohono O'odham]] and [[Apache]], span both sides of the US–Mexican border. By treaty, [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee people]] have the legal right to freely cross the US–Canada border.

{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica}}
There are over 114,000 inhabitants of Native American origins, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: [[Quitirrisí]] (In the Central Valley), [[Matambú]] or [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] (Guanacaste), [[Maleku people|Maleku]] (Northern Alajuela), [[Bribri people|Bribri]] (Southern Atlantic), [[Cabécar people|Cabécar]] (Cordillera de Talamanca), [[Boruca people|Boruca]] (Southern Costa Rica) and [[Ngäbe people|Ngäbe]] (Southern Costa Rica long the Panamá border).

These native groups are characterized for their work in wood, like masks, drums and other artistic figures, as well as fabrics made of cotton.

Their subsistence is based on agriculture, having corn, beans and plantains as the main crops.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

{{main|Demographics of El Salvador|1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre}}
[[File:Nuestros Angeles de El Salvador.jpg|thumb|Indigenous Salvadoran [[Pipil people|Pipil]] women dancing in the traditional Procession of Palms, [[Panchimalco]] in [[El Salvador]]]]
Much of [[El Salvador]] was home to the [[Pipil people|Pipil]], the [[Lenca people|Lenca]], Xinca, and [[Kakawira]]. The Pipil lived in western [[El Salvador]], spoke [[Nahuat|Nawat]], and had many settlements there, most noticeably [[Cuzcatlan]]. The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and [[fertile soil|fertile land]] that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in [[El Salvador]] as they had in other lands like [[Guatemala]] or [[Mexico]], but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]] along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people. Today many Pipil and other indigenous populations live in the many small towns of El Salvador like [[Izalco]], [[Panchimalco]], [[Sacacoyo]], and [[Nahuizalco]].

==== Nicaragua ====
About 5% of the [[Nicaraguan]] population are indigenous. The largest indigenous group in Nicaragua is the [[Miskito people]]. Their territory extended from [[Cape Camarón]], [[Honduras]], to [[La Cruz de Río Grande|Rio Grande]], Nicaragua along the [[Mosquito Coast]]. There is a native [[Miskito language]], but large numbers speak [[Miskito Coast Creole]], Spanish, [[Rama language|Rama]] and other languages. Their use of [[English-based creole languages|Creole English]] came about through frequent contact with the British, who colonized the area. Many Miskitos are Christians. Traditional Miskito society was highly structured, politically and otherwise. It had a king, but he did not have total power. Instead, the power was split between himself, a [[Miskito Governor]], a [[Miskito General]], and by the 1750s, a [[Miskito Admiral]]. Historical information on Miskito kings is often obscured by the fact that many of the kings were semi-[[mythology|mythical]].

Another major indigenous culture in eastern Nicaragua are the [[Sumo people|Mayangna (or Sumu) people]], counting some 10,000 people.<ref>Gould, J. L. (1998).

Large numbers of Bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language, culture, customs, and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period. They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of "empowered caciques" to further communal organization.

[[Ecuador]] was the site of many indigenous cultures, and civilizations of different proportions. An early sedentary culture, known as the [[Valdivia culture]], developed in the coastal region, while the [[Caras (tribe)|Caras]] and the [[Quitu]]s unified to form an elaborate civilization that ended at the birth of the Capital Quito. The [[Cañari]]s near [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] were the most advanced, and most feared by the [[Inca]], due to their fierce resistance to the Incan expansion. Their architecture remains were later destroyed by Spaniards and the Incas.

[[File:EquateurOtavalo 0606.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Otavalo people|Otavalo]] girl from Ecuador]]
Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. Primarily consisting of the descendants of peoples conquered by the Incas, they are [[Kichwa]] speakers and include the [[Inca-Caranqui|Caranqui]], the [[Otavalo people|Otavalo]]s, the Cayambe, the Quitu-Caras, the [[Panzaleo]], the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tugua, the Puruhá, the [[Cañari]], and the [[Saraguro people|Saraguro]]. Linguistic evidence suggests that the Salascan and the Saraguro may have been the descendants of Bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to Ecuador as ''mitimaes''.

Coastal groups, including the [[Awá (kwaiker)|Awá]], [[Ecuador|Chachi]], and the [[Tsáchila]], make up 0.24% percent of the indigenous population, while the remaining 3.35 percent live in the Oriente and consist of the Oriente Kichwa (the Canelo and the Quijos), the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], the [[Huaorani]], the Siona-Secoya, the [[Cofán people|Cofán]], and the [[Achuar people|Achuar]].

In 1986, indigenous people formed the first "truly" national [[Political organisation|political organization]]. [[CONAIE|The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[CONAIE]]) has been the primary political institution of the Indigenous since then and is now the second largest political party in the nation.

Indigenous population in Peru make up around 26% approximately.<ref name="census2017"/> Native Peruvian traditions and customs have shaped the way Peruvians live and see themselves today. Cultural citizenship—or what Renato Rosaldo has called, "the right to be different and to belong, in a democratic, participatory sense" (1996:243)—is not yet very well developed in Peru. This is perhaps no more apparent than in the country's Amazonian regions where indigenous societies continue to struggle against state-sponsored economic abuses, cultural discrimination, and pervasive violence.<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}}, [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 UPF.com]</ref>

Most [[Venezuela]]ns have some indigenous heritage and are [[pardo]], even if they identify as white. But those who identify as indigenous, from being raised in those cultures, make up only around 2% of the total population. The indigenous peoples speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects. As some of the ethnic groups are very small, their native languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades. The most important indigenous groups are the [[Ye'kuana]], the [[Wayuu]], the [[Pemon]] and the [[Warao people|Warao]]. The most advanced native people to have lived within the boundaries of present-day Venezuela is thought to have been the [[Timoto-cuicas]], who lived mainly in the Venezuelan Andes. Historians estimate that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand indigenous inhabitants at the time of Spanish colonization. The most densely populated area was the Andean region (Timoto-cuicas), thanks to their advanced agricultural techniques and ability to produce a surplus of food.

The 1999 [[constitution of Venezuela]] gives the indigenous [[special rights]], although the vast majority of them still live in very critical conditions of poverty. The government provides [[primary education]] in their languages in public schools to some of the largest groups, in efforts to continue the languages.

Indigenous peoples make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and are a significant element in most other former Spanish colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Uruguay]] ([[Charrua|Native Charrúa]]). According to the 2011 Census, 2.4% of Uruguayans reported having indigenous ancestry.<ref name="enha_asc"/> Some governments recognize some of the major Native American languages as official languages: [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in Peru and Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in Peru and [[Bolivia]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]] in [[Paraguay]], and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] in [[Greenland]].

==Rise of indigenous movements==
{{Indigenous rights}}
Since the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have become more politically active in asserting their treaty rights and expanding their influence. Some have organized in order to achieve some sort of [[self-determination]] and preservation of their cultures. Organizations such as the [[Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin]] and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are overcoming national borders to reunite indigenous populations, for instance those across the [[Amazon Basin]]. Similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] and the accession of native Indian groups into the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].

There has been a recognition of indigenous movements on an international scale. The membership of the [[United Nations]] voted to adopt the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], despite dissent from some of the stronger countries of the Americas.

In Colombia, various indigenous groups have protested the denial of their rights. People organized a march in [[Cali]] in October 2008 to demand the government live up to promises to protect indigenous lands, defend the indigenous against violence, and reconsider the [[free trade]] pact with the United States.<ref>[http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html Africa.euters.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027221046/http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html |date=27 October 2008 }}</ref>

The first indigenous candidate to be democratically elected as head of a country in Latin America was [[Benito Juárez]], a [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] Mexican; he was elected President of Mexico in 1858.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harten|first=Sven|title=The Rise of Evo Morales|year=2011|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-523-9}}</ref>

[[Evo Morales]] (Aymara people) was the first indigenous candidate elected as [[president of Bolivia]] and the first in South America. He won in [[2005 Bolivian general election|2005]], [[2009 Bolivian general election|2009]], [[2014 Bolivian general election|2014]], and [[2019 Bolivian general election|2019]] until eventually being forced out of office and into exile just weeks after his 2019 victory. His election encouraged the indigenous movement across Latin America.

Representatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major South American countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, started a forum in support of Morales' legal process of change. The meeting condemned plans by the European "foreign [[power elite]]" to destabilize the country. The forum also expressed solidarity with Morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities. It questioned US interference through diplomats and NGOs. The forum was suspicious of plots against Bolivia and other countries that elected leftist leaders, including Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay and [[Nicaragua]].<ref name="plenglish">[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D)&language=EN Plenglish.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409050852/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D%29&language=EN |date=9 April 2009 }}</ref>

The forum rejected the supposed violent method used by regional civic leaders from the called "Crescent departments" in Bolivia to impose autonomous statutes, applauded the decision to expel the US ambassador to Bolivia, and reaffirmed the sovereignty and independence of the presidency. Amongst others, representatives of [[CONAIE]], the [[National Indigenous Organization of Colombia]], the Chilean Council of All Lands, and the Brazilian Landless Movement participated in the forum.<ref name="plenglish"/>
