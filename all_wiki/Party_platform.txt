{{Party politics}}
A political '''party platform''' or '''program''' is a formal set of principal goals which are supported by a '''political party''' or individual [[candidate]], in order to appeal to the general public, for the ultimate purpose of garnering the general public's support and votes about complicated topics or issues. "Plank" is the term often given to the components of the political platform – the opinions and viewpoints about individual topics, as held by a party, person, or organization.  The word "plank" depicts a component of an overall political platform, as a metaphorical reference to a basic [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] made out of boards or [[Plank (wood)|planks of wood]].  The metaphor can return to its literal origin when [[public speaking]] or [[debates]] are actually held upon a physical platform.

A party platform is sometimes referred to as a [[manifesto]]<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifesto|title= Manifesto|publisher= Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-02-07}}</ref> or a political platform. Across the Western world, political parties are highly likely to fulfill their election promises.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Robert|last2=Royed|first2=Terry|last3=Naurin|first3=Elin|last4=Artés|first4=Joaquín|last5=Costello|first5=Rory|last6=Ennser-Jedenastik|first6=Laurenz|last7=Ferguson|first7=Mark|last8=Kostadinova|first8=Petia|last9=Moury|first9=Catherine|date=2017-07-01|title=The Fulfillment of Parties' Election Pledges: A Comparative Study on the Impact of Power Sharing|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=61|issue=3|pages=527–542|doi=10.1111/ajps.12313|issn=1540-5907|url=https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/59403/1/Thomson_etal_AJPS_2016_The_fulfillment_of_parties_election_pledges.pdf}}</ref>

==Origins==
The first known use of the word platform was in 1535. The word platform comes from [[Middle French]] ''plate-forme'', literally meaning "flat form".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/platform|title= Platform|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> The political meaning of the word to reflect "statement of party politics" is from 1803, probably originally an image of a literal platform on which politicians gather, stand, and make their appeals.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/platform|title= Platform|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>

==Fulfilling platforms==
A 2017 study in the ''[[American Journal of Political Science]]'' that analyzed 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States) found that political parties in government fulfill their [[election promise]]s to voters to a considerable extent.<ref name=":1" /> The study determined that:

<blockquote>Parties that hold executive office after elections generally fulfill substantial percentages, sometimes very high percentages, of their election pledges, whereas parties that do not hold executive office generally find that lower percentages of their pledges are fulfilled. The fulfillment of pledges by governing executive parties varies across governments in ways that reflect power-sharing arrangements. The main power-sharing arrangement that impacts pledge fulfillment distinguishes between single-party governments and coalitions, not between governments with and without legislative majorities. We found the highest percentages of pledge fulfillment for governing parties in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Canada, most of which governed in single-party executives. We found lower percentages for governing parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, and Italy, most of which governed in coalitions. Pledge fulfillment by U.S. presidential parties lies at the higher end of coalition governments, which suggests that U.S. presidents are more constrained than governing parties in single-party parliamentary systems, but less constrained than most governing parties in multiparty coalitions.</blockquote>Other research on the United States suggests that [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[Member of Congress|congresspeople]] voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/12/12060358/political-science-of-platforms|title=We asked 8 political scientists if party platforms matter.
