==History==
''CartaCapital'' was created as a monthly magazine in 1994 by [[Mino Carta]],<ref name=chb>{{cite book|author1=Christina Holtz-Bacha|author2=Jesper Strömbäck|title=Opinion Polls and the Media: Reflecting and Shaping Public Opinion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXiUiVxLO1kC&pg=PA148|accessdate=8 August 2015|date=5 April 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-37493-5|page=148}}</ref> an [[Italo Brazilian|Italo-Brazilian]] journalist. In 1968, Carta founded Brazil's leading newsmagazine ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]'' alongside [[Victor Civita]]. Eight years later, he founded ''[[ISTOÉ|IstoÉ]]'', another popular newsmagazine. Unsatisfied with the result of the magazines he helped to create, Carta founded ''CartaCapital'' as an alternative to these. ''CartaCapital'' is noted for its small crew; it only has eleven journalists.

The magazine was published on a monthly until 1996 when its frequency was switched to biweekly.<ref name=chb/> Its frequency was changed to weekly in 2002. The magazine is known for supporting causes in a biased way, such as [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]'s both candidatures, the legalization of [[abortion]] in all cases, the maintenance of the current age of criminal responsibility and the [[extradition]] of [[Cesare Battisti (born 1954)|Cesare Battisti]] to [[Italy]], among other polemic issues. Carta argues that the magazine does it to avoid hiding in a curtain of impartiality and not being honest to its readers.

''CartaCapital'' is a declared left-wing publication{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} but has in its staff Antonio Delfim Netto, Minister of Economy during the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|right-wing military dictatorship]]. Besides his participation in a right-wing government, Antonio Delfim Netto is a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]].{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

The magazine openly supported [[Dilma Rousseff]]'s government, although the article in which Mino Carta put and explained his position was later removed without notice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cartacapital.com.br/app/materia.jsp?a=2&a2=8&i=7214|title=Carta Capital|website=CartaCapital|language=Portuguese|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018234230/http://www.cartacapital.com.br/app/materia.jsp?a=2&a2=8&i=7214|archive-date=2010-10-18}}</ref>

''CartaCapital'' also publishes an [[educational]] magazine titled ''Carta na Escola'' on a monthly basis. It is dedicated to teachers, advising them on how to discuss the news with their students.
