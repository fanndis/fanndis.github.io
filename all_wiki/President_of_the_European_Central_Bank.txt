The '''President of the European Central Bank'''  is the head of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the main institution responsible for the management of the [[euro]] and [[monetary policy]] in the [[Eurozone]] of the [[European Union]] (EU).

The current President of the European Central Bank is [[Christine Lagarde]], previously Chair and Managing Director of the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Ms. Lagarde has served as President of the ECB since 1st November 2019. 

==Role and appointment==

{{Politics of the European Union}}

The President heads the Executive Board, Governing Council and General Council of the ECB. He or she also represent the bank abroad, for example at the [[G-20 major economies|G20]]. The officeholder is appointed by a [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|qualified majority vote]] of the [[European Council]], ''de facto'' by those who have adopted the euro, for an eight-year non-renewable term.<ref>[[:s:Consolidated protocols, annexes and declarations attached to the treaties of the European Union/Protocols#PROTOCOL (No 4) ON THE STATUTE OF THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF CENTRAL BANKS AND OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK|Protocol 4 of the consolidated European treaties]]</ref>

==History==

===Duisenberg===

[[Wim Duisenberg]] was President of the [[European Monetary Institute]] (EMI) when it became the ECB, just prior to the launch of the Euro, on 1 June 1998. Duisenberg then became the first President of the ECB.

The French interpretation of the agreement made with the installation of Wim Duisenberg as ECB President was that Duisenberg would resign after just four years of his eight-year term, and would be replaced by the Frenchman [[Jean-Claude Trichet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1809417.stm | title=New ECB chief 'must be French' | work=BBC, Friday, 8 February 2002 | accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Duisenberg always strongly denied that such an agreement was made and stated in February 2002 that he would stay in office until his 68th birthday on 9 July 2003.

In the meanwhile Jean-Claude Trichet was not cleared of legal accusations before 1 June 2002, so he was not able to begin his term after Duisenberg's first four years. Even on 9 July 2003 Trichet was not cleared, and therefore Duisenberg remained in office until 1 November 2003. Duisenberg died on 31 July 2005.

===Trichet===

[[Jean-Claude Trichet]] became president in 2003 and served during the [[European debt crisis|European sovereign debt crisis]]. Trichet's strengths lay in keeping consensus and visible calm in the ECB. During his tenure, Trichet has had to fend off criticism from [[President of France|President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] who demanded a more growth-orientated policy at the ECB. [[Chancellor of Germany|Germany Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] supported Trichet in demanding the bank's independence be respected.<ref>{{cite news|last=Murphy |first=Francois |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSPAB00349820070923 |title=Trichet brushes off French criticism of ECB |agency=Reuters   |accessdate=26 June 2011 |date=23 September 2007}}</ref>

However, he was also criticised from straying from his mandate during the crisis by buying the [[government bond]]s of eurozone member states. ECB board members [[Axel A. Weber]] and [[Jürgen Stark]] resigned in protest at this policy, even if it helped prevent states from defaulting. [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] economist Pau Rabanal argued that Trichet "maintained a relatively expansionary monetary policy," but even "sacrificed the ECB's inflation target for the sake of greater economic growth and jobs creation, and not the other way round." While straying from his mandate, he has however still kept interest rates under control and maintained greater price stability than the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] did before the euro.<ref name="elpais">By Xavier Vidal-Folch (translated by Anton Baer) 6 October 2011 [http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1029351-what-it-would-have-cost-without-trichet What it would have cost without Trichet], EL PAÍS, on [[Presseurop]]</ref><ref name="isanyone">[http://www.economist.com/node/21530960 The euro crisis: Is anyone in charge?], The Economist 1 October 2011</ref>

As well as defending the ECB's independence and balancing its commitment to interest rates and economic stability, Trichet also fought Sarkozy for automatic sanctions in the EU fiscal reforms and opposite [[Angela Merkel]]'s against private sector involvement in bail outs so as not to scare the markets. He had however made some mistakes during the crisis, for example by: raising interest rates just after inflation topped out and just prior to the recession triggered by the [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers collapse]]; also by its early timidity in buying eurozone state bonds.<ref name="elpais"/><ref name="isanyone"/>

In his final appearance (his 35th) before the European Parliament, Trichet called for more political unity, including; significant new powers to be granted to the ECB, the establishment of an executive branch with a European Finance Ministry and greater oversight powers for the European Parliament. He also asserted that the ECB's role in maintaining price stability throughout the financial crisis and the oil price rises should not be overlooked.<ref>Martin Banks - 4 October 2011 [http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/ecb-chief-calls-for-significant-new-powers-for-eu/ ECB chief calls for 'significant' new powers for EU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020082459/http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/ecb-chief-calls-for-significant-new-powers-for-eu/ |date=20 October 2011 }}, the Parliament Magazine</ref> He stated, in response to a question from a German newspaper attacking the ECB's credibility following its bond-buying;

{{cquote|...first, we were called to deliver price stability! ... We have delivered price stability over the first 12–13 years of the euro! Impeccably! I would like very much to hear some congratulations for this institution, which has delivered price stability in Germany over almost 13 years at approximately 1.55% - as the yearly average of inflation - we will recalculate the figure to the second decimal. This figure is better than any ever obtained in this country over a period of 13 years in the past 50 years. So, my first remark is this: we have a mandate and we deliver on our mandate! And we deliver in a way that is not only numerically convincing, but which is better than anything achieved in the past.|author=Jean Claude Trichet at the European Parliament, 8 September 2011<ref>[http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2011/html/is110908.en.html Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A)], ECB</ref>}}

===Draghi===

[[File:Duisenberg-Trichet-Draghi-10 €.jpeg|thumb|left|Signatures of Duisenberg, Trichet and Draghi on euro bills]]

Although [[Axel A. Weber|Axel Weber]] was tipped as one of the possible successors,<ref>{{cite web|last=Randow |first=Jana |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-09/weber-throws-ecb-race-open-as-he-signals-no-second-term-as-bundesbank-head.html |title=Weber Throws ECB Race Open by Ruling Out Second Bundesbank Term |publisher=Bloomberg |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref> he resigned from the ECB in protest at the bail out policies. [[Mario Draghi]] was chosen to become the next President of the ECB on 24 June 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Baker |first=Luke |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/06/24/uk-eu-summit-draghi-idUKTRE75N1JO20110624 |title=EU leaders appoint Mario Draghi as new ECB president &#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |accessdate=26 June 2011 |date=24 June 2011}}</ref> Draghi was president from 1 November 2011 until 31 October 2019 (succeeded by [[Christine Lagarde]]).

[[Pascal Canfin]], [[Member of the European Parliament]] for France, asserted that Draghi had been involved in swaps for European governments, namely Greece, trying to disguise their countries' economic status. Draghi responded that the deals were "undertaken before my joining [[Goldman Sachs]] [and] I had nothing to do with" them, in the 2011 European Parliament nomination hearings.

In December 2011, Draghi oversaw a €489 billion ($640 billion), three-year loan program from the ECB to European banks. The program was around the same size as the US [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (2008) though still much smaller than the overall US response including the [[Federal Reserve]]'s [[Federal Reserve responses to the subprime crisis|asset purchases and other actions]] of that time.

In February, 2012, a second, somewhat larger round of ECB loans to European banks was initiated under Draghi, called [[European Central Bank#Long-term refinancing operation|long term refinancing operation (LTRO)]]. One commentator, [[Matthew Lynn]], saw the ECB's injection of funds, along with [[Quantitative easing]] from the US Fed and the [[Bank of England#Asset Purchase Facility|Asset Purchase Facility]] at the [[Bank of England]], as feeding increases in [[oil prices]] in [[World oil market chronology from 2003#2011|2011]] and [[World oil market chronology from 2003#2012|2012]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Lynn | first = Matthew | title = What central banks provide, oil markets take away | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-central-banks-provide-oil-markets-take-away-2012-02-29 | work = MarketWatch | date = 29 February 2012 | access-date = 29 February 2012}}</ref>

In July 2012, in the midst of renewed fears about sovereigns in the eurozone, Draghi stated in a panel discussion that the ECB "...is ready to do ''whatever it takes'' to preserve the Euro. And believe me, it will be enough."<ref>{{cite AV media | people= Mario Draghi | date= 26 July 2012 |accessdate= 17 December 2012 | title= ECB's Draghi to the euro's rescue? | medium= Video | publisher= [[Euronews]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1V0aPEO3c }}</ref> This statement led to a steady decline in bond yields (borrowing costs) for eurozone countries, in particular Spain, Italy and France. In light of slow political progress on solving the eurozone crisis, Draghi's statement has been seen as a key turning point in the fortunes of the Eurozone.<ref>{{cite news | last = Watts | first = William L. | title = Here's how things look a year after Mario Draghi pledged 'whatever it takes' to save the euro (blog) | url = http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/07/26/heres-how-things-look-a-year-after-mario-draghi-pledged-whatever-it-takes-to-save-the-euro/ | work = MarketWatch | date = 26 July 2013 | access-date = 17 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Dixon | first = Hugo | author-link = Hugo Dixon | title = Saving face and the Euro will be tough | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/business/global/30iht-dixon30.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 30 July 2012 | access-date = 23 August 2018}}</ref>
