'''Lisa Nicole Brennan-Jobs''' (née '''Brennan'''; born May 17, 1978) is an American writer. She is the daughter of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Chrisann Brennan]]. Jobs initially denied paternity for several years, which led to a legal case and various media reports in the early days of Apple. Lisa and Steve Jobs eventually reconciled, and he accepted his paternity. Brennan-Jobs later worked as a journalist and magazine writer. An early Apple business computer, the [[Apple Lisa]], is named after Brennan-Jobs, and she has been depicted in a number of biographies and films, including the biopics ''[[Pirates of Silicon Valley]]'' (1999), ''[[Jobs (film)|Jobs]]'' (2013), and ''[[Steve Jobs (film)|Steve Jobs]]'' (2015). A fictionalized version of her is a major character in her aunt [[Mona Simpson]]'s novel ''A Regular Guy''.

==Birth==
Lisa Nicole Brennan was born on May 17, 1978 on [[Robert Friedland]]'s All One Farm [[History of the hippie movement#New Communalism|commune]] outside [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref name="JobsBio1">{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter | author-link =Walter Isaacson|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|year=2011|page=ebook|publisher=Simon & Schuster}}</ref><ref name=bite>{{cite book|last=Brennan |first=Chrisann | author-link =Chrisann Brennan|title=[[The Bite in the Apple|The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs]] |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |page=ebook |date=October 29, 2013}}</ref> Her mother, [[Chrisann Brennan]], and her father, Steve Jobs, first met at [[Homestead High School (Cupertino, California)|Homestead High School]] in [[Cupertino, California]] in 1972 and had an on-off relationship for the next five years.<ref name="JobsBio1" /><ref name="bite" /> In 1977, after Jobs had co-founded [[Apple Inc.]], he and Brennan moved into a house with their friend [[Daniel Kottke]] near the company's office in Cupertino, where they all worked.<ref name="JobsBio1" /><ref name="bite"/><ref name="standingphoto">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/pictures-of-apples-first-employees-2013-12|title=These Pictures Of Apple's First Employees Are Absolutely Wonderful|accessdate=January 19, 2015|last=Edwards|first=Jim|date=December 26, 2013|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]}}</ref> It was during this period that Brennan became pregnant with Lisa. Jobs, however, did not assume responsibility for the pregnancy, which led Brennan to end the relationship, leave their shared home, and support herself by cleaning houses.<ref name="bite"/>

In 1978, Brennan moved to the All One Farm commune to have the baby. Jobs was not present for the baby's birth and only came up three days later after Robert Friedland, the farm's owner and a friend of Jobs from [[Reed College]], persuaded him to do so. Brennan and Jobs named the baby Lisa. Jobs named the computer project he was working on, the [[Apple Lisa]], after her. Shortly after, Jobs publicly denied that he was the child's father. He claimed that the Apple Lisa was not named for her, and his team had come up with the phrase "Local Integrated System Architecture" as an alternative explanation for the project's name.<ref name="JobsBio1" /><ref name="kids" /> Decades later, Jobs admitted that "obviously, it was named for my daughter".<ref name="JobsBio1" />

==Paternity case and reconciliation==
After Lisa was born, Jobs publicly denied paternity, which led to a legal case. Even after a [[DNA paternity testing|DNA paternity test]] established him as her father, he maintained his position.<ref name="JobsBio1"/><ref name=kids/><ref name=bib/> The resolution of the legal case required him to provide Brennan with $385 per month and to reimburse the state for the money she had received from welfare. After Apple went public and Jobs became a multimillionaire, he increased the payment to $500 a month.<ref name="bite"/> [[Michael Moritz]] interviewed Jobs, Brennan, and a number of others for the 1982 [[Time Person of the Year|''Time'' Person of the Year]] special issue, released on January 3, 1983. In his interview, Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test, which had found that the "probability of paternity for Jobs, Steven... is 94.1%".<ref name="machineofthe year1">{{cite magazine|last1=Cocks|first1=Jay|author-link1=Jay Cocks|first2=Michael|last2=Moritz|author-link2=Michael Moritz|url=http://tech-insider.org/personal-computers/research/1983/0103.html|title=The Updated Book of Jobs|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date=January 3, 1983|accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref> Jobs responded by arguing that "28% of the male population of the United States could be the father".<ref name="JobsBio1" /><ref name="bite" /><ref name="machineofthe year1"/> Rather than name him "Person of the Year", as he and many others expected while giving the interviews, the issue was instead titled "Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves In".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=''Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves in.''|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date=January 3, 1983}}</ref> The thematic change occurred after Moritz heard about Brennan-Jobs as well as Jobs' management style.<ref name="JobsBio1"/><ref name="bite" />

Years later, after Jobs left Apple, he acknowledged Lisa and attempted to reconcile with her. Chrisann Brennan wrote that "he apologized many times over for his behavior" to her and Lisa and "said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry".<ref name="bite" /> After reconciling with her, nine-year-old Lisa wanted to change her last name and Jobs was happy and relieved to agree to it. Jobs legally altered her birth certificate, changing her name from Lisa Brennan to Lisa Brennan-Jobs.<ref name="bitecert">{{cite book |last=Brennan |first=Chrisann |date=October 29, 2013 |title=[[The Bite in the Apple|The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs]] |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |page=ebook |quote=Fast-forward six years when Lisa was nine, after she and her father had grown to know and love each other … It was in that window of time that Steve and Lisa decided to get her birth certificate straightened out. At nine, Lisa went from Lisa Brennan to Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Steve told me that he could hardly believe that she wanted to take his name. Very plainly relieved and honest, he said, 'I am just so happy that she does' … William Fenwick of Fenwick & West was the lawyer Steve used to fact-check and change the birth certificate.}}</ref> Brennan credits the change in Jobs to the influence of Brennan-Jobs' newly found biological aunt, author [[Mona Simpson]], who worked to repair the relationship between Brennan-Jobs and her father.<ref name="bite"/>

According to ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune magazine]]'', in his will, Jobs left Lisa a multi-million dollar inheritance.<ref name=Fortune2015-08-06/>
