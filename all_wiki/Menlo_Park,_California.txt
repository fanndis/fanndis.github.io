'''Menlo Park''' is a city located at the eastern edge of [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] within the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of California in the United States. It is bordered by [[San Francisco Bay]] on the north and east; [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]], [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], and [[Stanford, California|Stanford]] to the south; and [[Atherton, California|Atherton]], [[North Fair Oaks, California|North Fair Oaks]], and [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]] to the west. Menlo Park is one of the most educated cities in  California and the United States;  nearly 70% of residents over the age of 25 have earned a bachelor's degree or higher.<ref name="California's Most Educated Cities">{{cite news | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/17/californias-most-educated-cities_n_1100129.html | title = California's Most Educated Cities: Palo Alto, Los Altos Top the List | publisher = The Huffington Post Online| access-date = September 9, 2012 | first=Carly | last=Schwartz | date=November 17, 2011}}</ref> Menlo Park had 32,026 inhabitants according to the [[2010 United States Census]], which had grown to an estimated 34,698 inhabitants by 2019.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/state_census_data_center/census_2010/documents/2010Census_Table3A_RedistrictingFile.xls |title=Census 2010: Table 3A – Total Population by Race (Hispanic exclusive) and Hispanic or Latino: 2010 |format=Excel |publisher=[[California Department of Finance]] |access-date=March 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002449/http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/state_census_data_center/census_2010/documents/2010Census_Table3A_RedistrictingFile.xls |archive-date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/menloparkcitycalifornia/PST045217|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Menlo Park city, California|website=www.census.gov|language=en|access-date=January 28, 2018}}</ref> The city is home to the corporate headquarters of  [[Facebook]], and is where [[Google LLC|Google]] and [[Round Table Pizza]] were founded.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|17.4|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|9.8|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|7.6|sqmi}} are covered by water. <!-- The total area is 43.79% water. --> Menlo Park is long and narrow on a northeast to southwest axis. The northeast portion borders the San Francisco Bay and includes the [[Dumbarton Bridge (California)|Dumbarton Bridge]] that connects Menlo Park to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] on the east side of the bay. The city shoreline includes the city's largest park, Bedwell Bayfront Park ({{convert|160|acre|ha}}) and the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]].<ref name="bedwell">{{cite web|title=Bedwell Bayfront Park|url=https://www.menlopark.org/Facilities/Facility/Details/Bedwell-Bayfront-Park-6|website=Menlo Park, CA|access-date=February 4, 2017|language=en}}</ref> [[San Francisquito Creek]] marks much of the southeast border of the city. [[West Menlo Park]] (not part of the city despite its name) along [[Alameda de las Pulgas]] nearly separates the southwestern part of the city (known as Sharon Heights) from the rest. The extreme southwest is clipped by [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]].

The [[Bayshore Freeway]] (part of [[U.S. Route 101]])  traverses Menlo Park northwest to southeast near the shoreline and somewhat parallel to it to the southwest is [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]]. The intersection of El Camino Real and  Santa Cruz Avenue is considered the heart of the city. Nearby, the Menlo Park [[Civic Center]] is bounded by Ravenswood Avenue, Alma Street, Laurel Street, and Burgess Drive. It contains the [[City council|council]] offices, library, police station, and Burgess Park, which has various recreational facilities. Other major roads include [[Sand Hill Road]] in the Sharon Heights area.

The residential areas of Menlo Park can be unofficially divided into several neighborhoods. From "east" (northeast toward San Francisco Bay) to "west" (southwest toward the Pacific Coast), they are defined by the ''[[Palo Alto Weekly]]'' as:<ref name="PAO-neighborhoods">{{cite news|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2010/02/02/menlo-park-neighborhoods|title=Menlo Park neighborhoods|date=February 9, 2017|access-date=February 10, 2017|publisher=Palo Alto Online|language=en}}</ref> Belle Haven is the only neighborhood east of Route 101; much of the rest of that area is business or protected land.  Between 101 and the roughly parallel Middlefield Road are the neighborhoods of the Willows, Suburban Park, Lorelei Manor, Flood Triangle, Vintage Oaks, and South of Seminary (the seminary being [[Saint Patrick's Seminary and University|Saint Patrick's Seminary]]). Between Middlefield and El Camino Real are the [[Caltrain]] track and Felton Gables, Linfield Oaks, and Park Forest. West of El Camino until the foothills of the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] are the neighborhoods of Downtown Menlo Park, Central Menlo Park, and Allied Arts (sometimes also known as Stanford Park, it is named for the [[Allied Arts Guild]] in it). In the hills are Sharon Heights and Stanford Hills. Several other neighborhoods are closely associated with Menlo Park but are actually in unincorporated San Mateo county; these include [[Menlo Oaks, California|Menlo Oaks]] and Fair Oaks (latter part of the [[North Fair Oaks, California|North Fair Oaks]] census area) between Bayshore and Middlefield, University Heights (also known as West Menlo Park) between Sharon Heights and most of the rest of the city, and Stanford Weekend Acres, which is somewhat near Stanford Hills.

==History==
[[File:Menlo Park station postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Menlo Park Station, ca. 1918]]
The area of Menlo Park was inhabited by the [[Ohlone]] people when the [[Portolá expedition]] arrived in 1769.<ref>{{cite web |title=CHL # 2 Portolá Journey's End San Mateo |url=https://www.californiahistoricallandmarks.com/landmarks/chl-2 |website=www.californiahistoricallandmarks.com |access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref>     

In 1795, the [[Rancho de las Pulgas]] land grant was made that included the area of the current city.

In 1851, two Irish immigrants, Dennis J. Oliver and his brother-in-law D. C. McGlynn, purchased a {{convert|1700|acre|ha|adj=on}} tract of land on the former Rancho de las Pulgas.<ref name="hoover">{{cite book|page=405|title=Historic Spots in California|isbn=978-0-8047-4483-6|first=Mildred Brooke|last=Hoover|author2=Douglas E Kyle|location=Stanford, CA|publisher=Stanford University Press|edition=4th|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYMPR6xAj50C&q=0804744831&pg=PA405}}</ref> In 1854, they erected a gate with a wooden arch bearing the inscription "Menlo Park" and the date "August 1854" at the entrance to their property (now the intersection of Middle Ave and El Camino Real).<ref name="durham">{{cite book|title=California's Geographic Names: A Gazetteer of Historic and Modern Names of the State|isbn=978-1-884995-14-9|page=662|first=David L|last=Durham|location=Clovis, CA|publisher=Word Dancer Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yfa0hmE7yocC&q=1884995144&pg=PA662}}</ref><ref name="Stanger, 1963. pg. 109">Stanger, 1963. pg. 109</ref> The word "Menlo" derived from the owners' former home of [[Menlough]] in [[County Galway]], [[Ireland]], and is an [[Anglicized]] version of the original Irish name of the place, ''Mionloch'', meaning "middle lake".<ref name="hoover"/><ref>{{Cite web|last=Killelea|first=Patrick|date=2011|title=Visiting Menlough in Ireland, origin of Menlo Park's name|url=https://inmenlo.com/2011/06/11/visiting-menlough-in-ireland-origin-of-menlos-name/|access-date=2020-08-31|website=InMenlo.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1863, the [[San Francisco and San Jose Rail Road]] had built the railroad from San Francisco to as far as Mayfield (now [[California Avenue station]] in Palo Alto) and started running trains to the area.<ref name="mp-history">{{cite web|title=Menlo Park history|url=https://www.menlopark.org/888/Menlo-Park-history|website=City of Menlo Park - Official Website|access-date=February 5, 2017|language=en}}</ref> They named a nearby station "Menlo Park" after the sign.<ref name="hoover"/> The 1867 station building still stands on the platform of the current [[Menlo Park (Caltrain station)|Caltrain station]], used by the local Chamber of Commerce.

In 1917-18, a large portion of Menlo Park was the site of [[Camp Fremont]], a training camp for, at its height, 27,000 men being sent to fight in [[World War I]]. It did not last long (the camp was dismantled after the war), but army engineers paved the first streets in Menlo Park and laid the first water and gas lines.<ref name="kazak">{{cite web|last1=Kazak|first1=Don|title=The Peninsula mobilizes for war|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news_features/centennial/1906B.php|website=Palo Alto Online|access-date=February 5, 2017|date=April 13, 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525001652/https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news_features/centennial/1906B.php|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="fremonthistory">{{cite web|title=Historic California Posts: Camp Fremont|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/CpFremont.html|website=www.militarymuseum.org|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref> The army did retain the camp hospital, and it is now the site of a Veterans Administration hospital off of Willow Road in Menlo Park.

At the start of [[World War II]], the US government bought the {{convert|260|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate of [[Timothy Hopkins]] from his widow and created the Palo Alto General Hospital, later renamed the Dibble General Hospital (after Colonel John Dibble, who was killed in 1943). After the war ended, some of the land was sold to the city and became the sites of the main library and city hall. More of the land was bought by [[Stanford University]] to house the increase in students due to the [[G.I. Bill]]; the area was known as the "Stanford Village", which existed as student housing until the mid-1960s. This land also was the site of the Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]) starting in 1947; between 1955 and 1968, SRI bought the rest of the Stanford Village.<ref name="thurlow">{{cite web|title=History of the District & Community / Thurlow Estate becomes Dibble General Hospital becomes SRI Int|url=http://district.mpcsd.org/Page/143|website=Menlo Park City School District|access-date=February 5, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name="dibble">{{cite web|title=Dibble General Hospital|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/DibbleGH.html|website=www.militarymuseum.org|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name="sri">{{cite web|title=Corporate History {{!}}|url=https://www.sri.com/about/corporate-history|website=SRI International|access-date=February 5, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122205603/https://www.sri.com/about/corporate-history|archive-date=January 22, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
