==Overview==
The demonstrations began on the night of 21 November 2013, when protests erupted in the capital, [[Kyiv]], after the Ukrainian government suspended [[Plan on Priority Measures for European Integration of Ukraine|preparations for signing]] the [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement]] with the [[European Union]], to seek closer economic relations with Russia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ukraine drops EU plans and looks to Russia |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/11/ukraine-drops-eu-plans-looks-russia-20131121145417227621.html |accessdate =24 November 2013|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=21 November 2013}}</ref> On 24 November 2013, clashes between protesters and police began.

According to journalist Lecia Bushak writing in the 18 February 2014 issue of ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine,

<blockquote>EuroMaidan [had] grown into something far bigger than just an angry response to the fallen-through EU deal. It's now about ousting Yanukovych and his corrupt government; guiding Ukraine away from its 200-year-long, deeply intertwined and painful relationship with Russia; and standing up for basic human rights to protest, speak and think freely and to act peacefully without the threat of punishment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kiev's Minstrel of the Street Revolution|url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2014/02/21/kiev-s-minstrel-street-revolution.html |website=Newsweek |first=Lecia |last=Bushak |date=18 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304021040/http://mag.newsweek.com/2014/02/21/kiev-s-minstrel-street-revolution.html |archive-date=4 March 2014 |access-date=19 December 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>

A turning point came in late February, when enough members of the [[Party of Regions|president's party]] fled or defected for the party to lose its majority in parliament, leaving the opposition large enough to form the necessary [[quorum]]. This allowed parliament to pass a series of laws that removed police from Kyiv, canceled anti-protest operations, restored the 2004 constitution, freed political detainees, and removed President Yanukovych from office. Yanukovych then fled to Ukraine's second-largest city of [[Kharkiv]], refusing to recognise the parliament's decisions. The parliament assigned early elections for May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fisher |first=Max |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/20/ukraines-parliament-just-threw-president-yanukovych-under-the-bus-thats-great-news/ |title=Ukraine's parliament just threw President Yanukovych under the bus. That's great news |work=Washington Post |date=20 February 2014 |accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>

In early 2019, a Ukrainian court found Yanukovych guilty of treason. Yanukovych was also charged with asking Vladimir Putin to send Russian troops to invade Ukraine after he had fled the country. The charges will have a little real effect on Yanukovych, 69, who has lived in exile in the Russian city of Rostov since fleeing Ukraine under armed guard five years ago.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/25/ukraine-ex-president-viktor-yanukovych-found-guilty-of-treason|title=Ukraine's ex-president Viktor Yanukovych found guilty of treason|last=Roth|first=Andrew|date=25 January 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=23 February 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The term "Euromaidan" was initially used as a hashtag of Twitter.<ref name="What's in a name"/> A Twitter account named Euromaidan was created on the first day of the protests.<ref>{{cite web|title=Євромандай|url=https://www.twitter.com/euromaidan/status/403636218065211393|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=10 December 2013|date=21 November 2013}}</ref> It soon became popular in the international media.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chervonenko|first=Vitalii|title=Ukraine's EU options 'still open'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25087160|accessdate=2 December 2013|date=25 November 2013|agency=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> The name is composed of two parts: "Euro" is short for Europe and "maidan" refers to [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] (Independence Square), the large square in the downtown of Kyiv, where the protests mostly took place. The word "Maidan" is a Turkish word meaning "square" or "open space" adopted by Ukrainians from the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="What's in a name"/> During the protests, the word "Maidan" acquired meaning of the public practice of politics and protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/mar/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/ |title=Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine |author=Timothy Snyder |work=The New York Review of Books |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=3 March 2014|quote=But a maidan now means in Ukrainian what the Greek word agora means in English: not just a marketplace where people happen to meet, but a place where they deliberately meet, precisely in order to deliberate, to speak, and to create a political society. During the protests the word maidan has come to mean the act of public politics itself, so that for example people who use their cars to organize public actions and protect other protestors are called the automaidan.}}</ref>

The term "Ukrainian Spring" is sometimes used, echoing the term [[Arab Spring]].<ref name="israelnationalnews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/174877 |title=Kerry in Moldova Supports Ukrainian 'Spring' |publisher=Israelnationalnews.com |date=6 December 2013 |accessdate=3 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207232344/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/174877 |archivedate=7 February 2014 }}</ref><ref name="Photo Essay: The Ukrainian Spring">{{cite web|last=Verger |first=Rob |url=http://www.newsweek.com/photo-essay-ukrainian-spring-224218 |title=Photo Essay: The Ukrainian Spring |work=Newsweek |date= 9 December 2013|accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>

===Comparison with the Orange Revolution===
The pro-European Union protests are Ukraine's largest since the [[Orange Revolution]] of 2004, which saw Yanukovych forced to resign as prime minister over allegations of voting irregularities. Although comparing the 2013 events in the same [[Eastern world#European concepts|East]]-West vector as 2004, with Ukraine remaining "a key geopolitical prize in eastern Europe" for Russia and the EU, ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' noted that Yanukovych's government was in a significantly stronger position following [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election|his election in 2010]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/ukrainian-protests-compared-to-2004-orange-revolution/490205.html|title=Ukrainian Protests Compared to 2004 Orange Revolution|newspaper=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' said the 2013 protests were "largely spontaneous, sparked by social media, and have caught Ukraine's political opposition unprepared" compared to their well-organised predecessors.<ref>{{cite news|last=Olearchyk|first=Roman |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4005fa5a-5913-11e3-9798-00144feabdc0.html|title=Ukraine protests hampered by fragmenting of political opposition|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=30 November 2013|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> The hashtag #euromaidan (Ukrainian #євромайдан, Russian #евромайдан), emerged immediately on the first meeting of the protests and was highly useful as a communication instrument for protesters.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|author=BBC Trending |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-25050141 |title=BBC News – European Square: Hashtag of Ukraine protest |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=3 March 2014|work=BBC News }}</ref> [[Vitali Klitschko]] wrote in a tweet<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Vitaliy_Klychko/status/403674179779969024 |title=Twitter / Vitaliy_Klychko: Друзі!

In an interview, opposition leader Yuriy Lutsenko, when asked if the current opposition was weaker than it was in 2004, argued that the opposition was stronger because the stakes were higher, "I asked each [of the opposition leaders]: 'Do you realise that this is not a protest? It is a revolution [...] we have two roads – we go to prison or we win.'"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2013/12/9/7005531/|title=Юрій Луценко: У нас дві дороги – у в'язницю або до перемоги|newspaper=Ukrayinska Pravda|date=9 December 2013|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref>

[[Paul Robert Magocsi]] illustrated the effect of the Orange Revolution on Euromaidan, saying,

<blockquote>Was the Orange Revolution a genuine revolution? Yes it was. And we see the effects today. The revolution wasn't a revolution of the streets or a revolution of (political) elections; it was a revolution of the minds of people, in the sense that for the first time in a long time, Ukrainians and people living in territorial Ukraine saw the opportunity to protest and change their situation. This was a profound change in the character of the population of the former Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|last=Magocsi|first=Paul Robert|title=EuroMaidan vs. Orange Revolution, PR Magocsi (ЄвроМайдан)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owr9a-Vo5qk|publisher=UkeTube|accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Lviv]]-based historian [[Yaroslav Hrytsak]] also remarked on the generational shift,

<blockquote>This is a revolution of the generation that we call the contemporaries of Ukraine's independence (who were born around the time of 1991); it is more similar to the Occupy Wall Street protests or those in Istanbul demonstrations (of this year). It's a revolution of young people who are very educated, people who are active in social media, who are mobile and 90 percent of whom have university degrees, but who don't have futures.<ref name="KPUEM2711"/></blockquote>

According to Hrytsak: "Young Ukrainians resemble young Italians, Czech, Poles, or Germans more than they resemble Ukrainians who are 50 and older. This generation has a stronger desire for European integration and fewer regional divides than their seniors."<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-protests-generational-divide/25182439.html In Ukraine, Protests Highlight 'Generational Rift'], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (27 November 2013)</ref> In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll taken in September, joining the European Union was mostly supported by young Ukrainians (69.8% of those aged 18 to 29), higher than the national average of 43.2% support.<ref name=whichunion>{{in lang|uk}} [http://kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&cat=news&id=197&page=1 Which way Ukraine should go – which union should join?], [[Kyiv International Institute of Sociology]] (3 October 2013)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/poll-ukrainian-public-split-over-eu-customs-union-options-332470.html|title=Poll: Ukrainian public split over EU, Customs Union options|newspaper=[[Kyiv Post]]|date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> A November 2013 poll by the same institute found the same result with 70.8% aged 18 to 29 wanting to join the European Union while 39.7% was the national average of support.<ref name=whichunion/> An opinion poll by [[GfK]] conducted 2–15 October found that among respondents aged 16–29 with a position on integration, 73% favoured signing an Association Agreement with the EU, while only 45% of those over the age of 45 favoured Association.

===Escalation to violence===
[[File:Euromaidan Kiev 2014-02-18 15-08.JPG|thumb|Euromaidan protest in Kyiv, 18 February 2014]]
The movement started peacefully but later protesters felt justified in using violence after the government's crackdown on protesters which happened during the night of 30 November 2013. The [[Associated Press]] said on 19 February:

{{quote|The latest bout of street violence began Tuesday when protesters attacked police lines and set fires outside parliament, accusing Yanukovych of ignoring their demands to enact constitutional reforms that would limit the president's power—a key opposition demand. Parliament, dominated by his supporters, was stalling on taking up a constitutional reform to limit presidential powers.

Police responded by attacking the protest camp. Armed with water cannons, stun grenades and rubber bullets, police dismantled some barricades. But the protesters held their ground through the night, encircling the protest camp with new burning barricades of tires, furniture and debris.<ref>[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20140219/WIRE/140219514 "Ukraine president, protest leaders agree on truce"], Associated Press via ''The Gainesville Sun'' (February 19, 2013).</ref>}}

In the early stages of Euromaidan, there was discussion about whether the Euromaidan movement constituted a revolution – or a staged 'Colour Revolution' by outside forces. At the time many protest leaders (such as [[Oleh Tyahnybok]]) had already used this term frequently when addressing the public. Tyahnybok called in an official 2 December press release for police officers and members of the military to defect to 'the Ukrainian revolution'.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tyahnybok|first=Oleh|title=Oleh Tyahnybok: I appeal to law-enforcement agents who still have their honor – choose the side of the Ukrainian revolution!|url=http://en.svoboda.org.ua/news/comments/00008492/|newspaper=Svoboda|accessdate=2 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125092724/http://en.svoboda.org.ua/news/comments/00008492/|archive-date=25 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In a [[Skype]] interview with media analyst Andrij Holovatyj, [[Vitaly Portnikov]], Council Member of the "Maidan" National Alliance and President and Editor-in-Chief of the Ukrainian television channel [[TVi (channel)|TVi]], stated "EuroMaidan is a revolution and revolutions can drag on for years" and that "what is happening in Ukraine goes much deeper. It is changing the national fabric of Ukraine."<ref>{{YouTube|VDftfd8nhUA|UkeTube}}</ref>

Media outlets in the region dubbed the movement, ''Eurorevolution''<ref>{{cite news |author=Anders Aslund |title=Euro Revolution in Ukraine |publisher=KyivPost |date=26 February 2014 |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/anders-aslund-euro-revolution-in-ukraine-332865.html}}</ref> ({{lang-ua|Єврореволюція}}). On 10 December Yanukovych said "Calls for a revolution pose a threat to national security."<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/12/20131210163821530248.html Ukraine president slams calls for revolution], [[Al Jazeera]] (10 December 2013)</ref> Former [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n president [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] has described the movement as "the first geopolitical revolution of the 21st century".<ref>{{cite news|last=Saakashvili|first=Mikheil|title=Why the West Must Join the Ukraine Protesters |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303553204579346560862388416|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=27 January 2014}}</ref>

Political expert [[Anders Åslund]] commented on this aspect:

<blockquote>Revolutionary times have their own logic that is very different from the logic of ordinary politics, as writers from Alexis de Tocqueville to Crane Brinton have taught. The first thing to understand about Ukraine today is that it has entered a revolutionary stage. Like it or not, we had better deal with the new environment rationally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.piie.com/realtime/?p=4222 |title=RealTime Economic Issues Watch &#124; Yanukovych's Time Is Up in Ukraine; the West Must Prepare |publisher=Blogs.piie.com |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=3 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071355/http://blogs.piie.com/realtime/?p=4222 |archive-date=8 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>

==Demands==
[[File:Opposition leaders.jpg|thumb|Opposition leaders [[Vitali Klitschko]], [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] and [[Oleh Tyahnybok]], addressing demonstrators, 27 November 2013]]
On 29 November, a formal resolution by protest organisers made the following demands.:<ref name=KPUEM2711/>
#The formation of a co-ordinating committee to communicate with the European community.
#A statement indicating that the president, parliament, and the Cabinet of Ministers aren't capable of carrying out a geopolitically strategic course of development for the state and demanding Yanukovych's resignation.
#The cessation of political repressions against EuroMaidan activists, students, civic activists and opposition leaders.

The resolution stated that on 1 December, on the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|22nd anniversary of Ukraine's]] [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|independence referendum]], that the group will gather at noon on Independence Square to announce their further course of action.<ref name=KPUEM2711/>

After the forced police dispersal of all protesters from Maidan Nezalezhnosti on the night of 30 November, the dismissal of [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Minister of Internal Affairs]] [[Vitaliy Zakharchenko]] became one of the protesters' main demands.<ref name=Zakgo>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/179588.html Ukraine's interior minister has no intention to resign], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (5 December 2013)</ref>

Ukrainian students nationwide have also demanded the dismissal of [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine|Minister of Education]] [[Dmytro Tabachnyk]].

On 5 December, [[Batkivshchyna]] faction leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk stated,

<blockquote>Our three demands to the Verkhovna Rada and the president remained unchanged: the resignation of the government; the release of all political prisoners, first and foremost; [the release of former Ukrainian Prime Minister] Yulia Tymoshenko; and [the release of] nine individuals [who were illegally convicted after being present at a rally on Bankova Street on December 1]; the suspension of all criminal cases; and the arrest of all Berkut officers who were involved in the illegal beating up of children on Maidan Nezalezhnosti.<ref name=Yatdem51213>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/179477.html Yatseniuk: Current political crisis cannot be resolved through parliamentary methods], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (5 December 2013)</ref></blockquote>

The opposition also demanded that the government resumed negotiations with the IMF for a [[Economy of Ukraine#IMF|loan]] that they saw as key to helping Ukraine "through economic troubles that have made Yanukovych lean toward Russia".<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-opposition-no-talks-unless-government-fired-1.2455476 Ukraine opposition: no talks unless government fired], [[CBC News]] (7 December 2013)</ref>

{{main|2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots}}
On 19 January, a Sunday mass protest, the ninth in a row, took place gathering up to 200,000 in central Kyiv to protest against the new anti-protest laws, dubbed the Dictatorship laws. Many protesters ignored the face concealment ban by wearing party masks, hard hats and gas masks. Opposition leader Vitali Klitschko appeared covered with powder after he was sprayed with a fire extinguisher. Riot police and government supporters cornered a group of people who were trying to seize government buildings. The number of riot police on Hrushevskoho Street increased after buses and army trucks showed up. The latter resulted in the buses being burned as a barricade. The next day, a clean-up began in Kyiv. On 22 January, more violence erupted in Kyiv. This resulted in 8–9 people dead.

On 25 November, in Odessa, 120 police raided and destroyed a tent encampment made by protesters at 5:20 in the morning. The police detained three of the protesters, including the leader of the Odessa branch of [[Democratic Alliance (Ukraine)|Democratic Alliance]], Alexei Chorny. All three were beaten in the police vehicle and then taken to the Portofrankovsk Police Station without their arrival being recorded. The move came after the District Administrative Court hours earlier issued a ban restricting citizens' right to peaceful assembly until New Year.

The removal or destruction of Lenin monuments and statues gained particular momentum after the destruction of the Kyiv Lenin statue. Under the motto "Ленінопад" (Leninopad, translated into English as "Leninfall"), activists pulled down a dozen monuments in the Kyiv region, Zhytomyr, Chmelnitcki, and elsewhere, or damaged them during the course of the EuroMaidan protests into spring of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ua/ukrayina/leninopad-trivaye-vozhdya-skinuli-v-kanevi-mikolayevi-hersoni-336067.html |title=Ленінопад триває: вождя скинули в Каневі, Миколаєві, Херсоні – Новини України на 1+1 – ТСН.ua |publisher=Tsn.ua |date= 22 February 2014|accessdate=16 March 2014}}</ref> In other cities and towns, monuments were removed by organised heavy equipment and transported to scrapyards or dumps.<ref>{{cite web|author=Софія Середа |url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25225395.html |title=В Україні – Ленінопад: пам'ятники вождю падають один за одним |publisher=Radiosvoboda.org |date= |accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>

On 22 January in Donetsk, two simultaneous rallies were held – one pro-Euromaidan and one pro-government. The pro-government rally attracted 600 attendees to about 100 from the Euromaidan side. Police reports claimed 5,000 attended to support the government, to only 60 from Euromaidan. In addition, approximately 150 titushky appeared and encircled the Euromaidan protesters with megaphones and began a conflict, burning wreaths and [[Svoboda (political party)|Svoboda]] Party flags, and shouted "down with fascists!", but were separated by police.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theinsider.com.ua/politics/52dfbb4e49bba/|script-title=uk:"Тітушки" вогнем розігнали Донецький Євромайдан|agency=[[The Insider (newspaper)|The Insider]]|date=22 January 2014|accessdate=23 January 2014|language=uk|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124232725/http://www.theinsider.com.ua/politics/52dfbb4e49bba/|archivedate=24 January 2014}}</ref> Meanwhile, Donetsk City Council pleaded with the government to take tougher measures against Euromaidan protesters in Kyiv.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theinsider.com.ua/politics/52dfd23a4650b/|title=Донецька міськрада просить Януковича вжити жорсткі заходи|agency=The Insider|date=22 January 2014|accessdate=23 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125135925/http://www.theinsider.com.ua/politics/52dfd23a4650b/|archivedate=25 January 2014}}</ref> Reports indicated a media blackout took place in Donetsk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/spilnotv.en/posts/472964822809973 |title=Facebook |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>

In the beginning of March, thousands of Crimean Tatars in support of Euromaidan clashed with pro-Russian protesters in Simferopol.

On 4 March 2014, a mass pro-Euromaidan rally was held in Donetsk for the first time. About 2,000 people were there. Donetsk is a major city in the far east of Ukraine and serves as Yanukovych's stronghold and the base of his supporters.

===Antimaidan and pro-government rallies===
{{main|Anti-Maidan}}
Pro-government rallies during Euromaidan have largely been credited as funded by the government. Several news outlets have investigated the claims to confirm that by and large, attendees at pro-government rallies do so for financial compensation and not for political reasons, and are not an organic response to the Euromaidan. "People stand at Euromaidan protesting against the violation of human rights in the state, and they are ready to make sacrifices," said Oleksiy Haran, a political scientist at [[Kyiv Mohyla Academy]] in Kyiv. "People at Antimaidan stand for money only. The government uses these hirelings to provoke resistance. They won't be sacrificing anything."<ref>{{cite news|last=Rudenko|first=Olga|title=Protesters: Ukraine paying for pro-government rallies|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/02/16/ukraine-government-protests/5435315/|newspaper=USA Today|date=16 February 2014}}</ref>

==Euromaidan groups==

===Automaidan===
{{main|Automaidan}}
Automaidan<ref>''Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom'' (Motion picture). 9 October 2015.
</ref> was a movement within the Euromaidan, that sought the resignation of the Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. It was made up mainly of drivers who would protect the protest camps and blockade streets. It organised a [[car]] procession on 29 December 2013 to the president's residence in [[Mezhyhirya (residence)|Mezhyhirya]] to voice their protests at his refusal to sign the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement in December 2013. The motorcade was stopped a couple of hundred metres short of his residence. Automaidan was the repeated target of violent attacks by government forces and supporters.

====Hrushevskoho Street riot shootings====
During the [[2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots]] of 22–25 January, 3 protesters were killed by firearms.

Oleh Tatarov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's Main Investigative Directorate under Yanukovych, claimed in January that "[t]he theory we are looking at is the killing was by unidentified persons. This is an official theory, and the unidentified persons could be various people, a whole host of them… It could have been motivated by disruptive behavior, or with the aim of provocation."

A report published on 25 January by Armament Research Services, a speciality arms and munitions consultancy in Perth, Australia, stated that the mysterious cufflink-shaped projectiles presumably fired by riot police on [[Hrushevskoho Street]] at protesters during clashes were not meant for riot control, but for stopping vehicles, busting through doors and piercing armour. The bullets were reported to be special armour-piercing 12-gauge shotgun projectiles, likely developed and produced by the ''Spetstekhnika'' (Specialized Equipment) design bureau, a facility located in Kyiv and associated with the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>{{cite web |author=Christopher J.

====Snipers deployed during the climax of the protests====
Following the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|revolution]] of 18–23 February that saw over 100 killed in gunfire, the government's new health minister, Oleh Musiy, a doctor who helped oversee medical treatment for casualties during the protests, suggested to The Associated Press that the similarity of bullet wounds suffered by opposition victims and police indicates the shooters were trying to stoke tensions on both sides and spark even greater violence, with the goal of toppling Yanukovych and justifying a Russian invasion. "I think it wasn't just a part of the old regime that (plotted the provocation), but it was also the work of Russian special forces who served and maintained the ideology of the (old) regime," he said, citing forensic evidence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russia, Ukraine feud over sniper carnage|url=https://news.yahoo.com/russia-ukraine-feud-over-sniper-carnage-203319580.html|newspaper=Associated Press|date=8 March 2014}}</ref> [[Hennadiy Moskal]], a former deputy head of Ukraine's main security agency, the SBU, and of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, suggested in an interview published in the Ukrainian newspaper [[Zerkalo Nedeli|Dzerkalo Tizhnya]] that snipers from the MIA and SBU were responsible for the shootings, not foreign agents, acting on contingency plans dating back to Soviet times, stating: "Snipers received orders to shoot not only protesters, but also police forces.

[[Olga Bogomolets]], the doctor, who allegedly claimed that protesters and Berkut troops came under fire from the same source, said she had not told Paet that policemen and protesters had been killed in the same manner, that she did not imply that the opposition was implicated in the killings, and that the government informed her that an investigation had been started.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10677370/Ukraine-Russia-crisis-live.html | title=Ukraine crisis: March 5 as it happened, entry for 15.17 | newspaper=The Telegraph | date=5 March 2014}}</ref> A German TV investigation met one of the few doctors that treated the wounded of both sides.

"We have substantiated grounds to consider that these very groups which were located at an SBU training ground took part in the planning and execution of activities of this so-called antiterrorist operation," said Nalyvaichenko.

The sniper said he was recruited by a "former military" claiming to be working for Euromaidan leadership. These morning shots are said to have provoked return fire from police snipers that resulted in many deaths. Andriy Shevchenko from Euromaidan leadership said he received calls from anti-riot police command reporting that his people are being shot by sniper bullets from the areas controlled by the protesters. Another Euromaidan leader, Andriy Parubiy, said his team searched the Conservatory and found no snipers. He confirmed that many victims on both sides were shot by snipers, but they were shooting from other, taller buildings surrounding the Conservatory and was convinced they were snipers controlled by Russia.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-31359021 |title=The untold story of the Maidan massacre |publisher=BBC |date=12 February 2015 |accessdate=13 February 2015 |author=Gabriel Gatehouse|work=BBC News }}</ref>
