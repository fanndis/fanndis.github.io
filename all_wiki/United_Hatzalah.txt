'''United Hatzalah''' ("united rescue" in Hebrew: איחוד הצלה) is a free, volunteer-based [[emergency medical services]] (EMS) organization based in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].  Its mission is to provide immediate medical intervention during the critical window between the onset of an emergency and the arrival of traditional ambulance assistance. It is one of many [[Hatzalah]] organizations in various parts of the world.

United Hatzalah of Israel was founded in 2006 with the merger of several small local hatzalah organizations. It has grown to become the largest independent, non-profit, fully volunteer EMS organization in the world, with over 6,000 volunteer medics nationwide. The organization provides free services to all citizens regardless of race, religion, or national origin. With the help of its Uber-like GPS dispatch system and fleet of rapid response ambucycles, United Hatzalah has achieved an average response time of less than 3 minutes nationwide and 90 seconds in metropolitan areas.

United Hatzalah's national command center in Jerusalem uses an advanced GPS-based dispatch technology to identify the closest and most qualified volunteers and routes them to the scene of an emergency through a mobile device application.  Approximately 1,000 volunteers are outfitted with medically equipped motorcycles “[[Motorcycle ambulance|ambucycles]]” capable of navigating around traffic jams to reach victims in as few as 90 seconds.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Arom |first1=Eitan |last2=Schachne |first2=Erica |title=Just an Ambucycle Ride away |date=January 1, 2015 |url=https://www.jpost.com/Metro/Just-an-ambucycle-ride-away-386350 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref> The organization is funded exclusively through private charitable support.

Within Israel, individuals may contact United Hatzalah through its direct emergency number, 1221; however, some dispatch information is received directly from national ambulance services. United Hatzalah in turn alerts and coordinates with local ambulances, Search and Rescue (SAR), fire<ref>{{Cite web|last=Poch|first=Raphael|date=2018-03-26|title=Fire and Rescue Department Commissioner: “Fire Fighters should Also Be EMTs” {{!}} Saving Lives in Israel with Rapid Emergency Response|url=https://israelrescue.org/blog/fire-and-rescue-department-commissioner-fire-fighters-should-also-be-emts/|access-date=2020-06-22|language=en}}</ref>, and police services<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rudee|first=Eliana|title=United Hatzalah Hosts Mass-Casualty Drill in Conjunction with Israeli Police, Local Soccer Team|url=https://www.jewishpress.com/news/israel/united-hatzalah-hosts-mass-casualty-drill-in-conjunction-with-israeli-police-local-soccer-team/2019/10/30/|access-date=2020-06-22|language=en-US}}</ref>, and the IDF<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-03-14|title=Volunteer EMS Organization United Hatzalah, Israel Defense Forces Hold Cooperative MCI Drill|url=https://www.jems.com/2016/03/14/volunteer-ems-organization-united-hatzalah-israel-defense-forces-hold-cooperative-mci-drill/|access-date=2020-06-22|website=JEMS|language=en-US}}</ref>, when necessary.

== History ==
As a young EMT in Jerusalem, [[Eli Beer]] recognized that heavy urban traffic and narrow streets often prevented ambulances from arriving in time to save a victim.

Initially, volunteers responded to less than 200 calls per day by monitoring two-way emergency radio scanners.  As cellular technology evolved, volunteers migrated to a managed [[push-to-talk]] network, which enabled two-way communications between dispatchers and volunteer medics.

After the [[Second Lebanon War]] (Hebrew: מלחמת לבנון השנייה, ''Milhemet Levanon HaShniya'') in 2006, Beer brought together more than 50 independent Hatzalah organizations to form United Hatzalah of Israel.

In 2008 United Hatzalah developed the LifeCompass GPS dispatch technology and mobile app medley capable of tracking the location of volunteers in real time, assessing the unique capabilities, mobility and equipment of the closest volunteers, and routing the most appropriate medics to any given emergency.  Today, all volunteers receive a standard-issue smartphone linked to the second generation LifeCompass 2.0<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hatzalah adapts to technological revolution - Technology & Health|url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/239797|access-date=2020-06-22|website=Israel National News|language=en}}</ref> command-and-control system.<ref>{{cite news |last=Siegel-Itzkovich |first=Judy |date=May 7, 2012 |title=Gov't Dithers in Red Tape, Defibrillator Saves Life |url=https://www.jpost.com/Health-and-Science/Govt-dithers-in-red-tape-defibrillator-saves-life |language=en |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref>

== Results and Demographics ==
United Hatzalah currently responds to approximately 1800 calls per day and as many as 2,500 calls during large-scale emergencies such as the 2014 [[Israel-Gaza conflict|Israel–Gaza Conflict]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-07-04|title=Gaza War prompted numerous EMS changes in Israel|url=https://www.sdjewishworld.com/2016/07/04/gaza-war-prompted-numerous-ems-changes-israel/|access-date=2020-06-22|website=San Diego Jewish World|language=en-US}}</ref>  In 2019, the organization answered more than 650,000 calls, with a volunteer corps of 6,000 medics, and a fleet of 1,000 ambucycles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

United Hatzalah’s lifesaving model has reduced average first-response time to three minutes. Sudden cardiac arrest calls are the best measure of emergency medical performance.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}  Since United Hatzalah’s inception, the rate of [[Cardiac arrest|cardiac-arrest]] deaths has decreased by 50%, according to the Israel Heart Society.  At 46.4 deaths per 100,000 people, the [[World Health Organization]] reported in 2011 that Israel ranks 12th best out of 192 countries in terms of coronary-related mortality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Atlas on cardiovascular disease prevention and control|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241564373_eng.pdf|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>

United Hatzalah's volunteer base in 2018 is approximately 60% Jewish Religious, 30% Jewish Secular and 10% Minorities (Muslim, Christian and Druze).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Andrew Tobin|title=The first medic to respond to the Temple Mount terror attack was Muslim.
