'''J. C. Penney Company, Inc.''' (doing business as '''JCPenney''' and abbreviated '''JCP''') is an American [[department store]] chain with 840 locations in 49 [[U.S. state]]s and [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name="JCP">http://stores.jcpenney.com retrieved May 15, 2020</ref> In addition to selling conventional merchandise, JCPenney offers large Fine Jewelry departments, The Salon by InStyle, and Sephora inside JCPenney. JCPenney stores often house several leased departments such as, [[Seattle's Best Coffee]], [[US Vision|optical]] centers, and [[Lifetouch|portrait studios]].

Most JCPenney stores are located in [[suburb]]an [[shopping mall]]s. Before 1966, most of its stores were located in downtown areas. As shopping malls became more popular during the later half of the 20th century, JCPenney began relocating and developing stores to anchor the malls. In more recent years, the chain has continued to follow consumer traffic, echoing the retailing trend of opening some freestanding stores, including some next door to competitors. Certain stores are located in [[power center (retail)|power centers]]. The company has been an Internet retailer since 1998. It has streamlined its catalog and distribution while undergoing renovation improvements at store level.

In May 2020, JCPenney filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection and in September 2020, [[Brookfield Property Partners]] and [[Simon Property Group]] agreed to purchase JCPenney for around $800 million in cash and debt. The deal was later approved by the [[U.S. bankruptcy court|U.S. Bankruptcy Court]] for the Southern District of Texas, two months later.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Press|first=Associated|title=J.C.

==Operations during 20th century==
===Early history===
[[File:Golden Rule store.png|thumb|right|First J. C. Penney store in Kemmerer, Wyoming. Originally called The Golden Rule Store]]
[[James Cash Penney]] was born in [[Hamilton, Missouri]]. After graduating from high school, Penney worked for a local retailer. He relocated to Colorado at the advice of a doctor, hoping that a better climate would improve his health.<ref>{{cite web|title=JC Penney Company History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/j-c-penney-company-inc-history/|work=Funding Universe|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404102222/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/j-c-penney-company-inc-history/|archive-date=April 4, 2013}}</ref> In 1898, Penney went to work for Thomas Callahan and Guy Johnson, who owned dry goods stores called Golden Rule stores in Colorado and Wyoming.<ref name=mo>[http://shs.umsystem.edu/historicmissourians/name/p/penney/ J. C.

Using money from savings and a loan, Penney joined the partnership and moved with his wife and infant son to [[Kemmerer, Wyoming]], to start his own store.<ref name=mo/> Penney opened the store on April 14, 1902.<ref name=mo/>  He participated in the creation of two more stores and purchased full interest in all three locations when Callahan and Johnson dissolved their partnership in 1907. In 1909, Penney moved his company headquarters to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] to be closer to banks and railroads. By 1912, Penney had 34 stores in the Rocky Mountain States. In 1913, all stores were consolidated under the J. C. Penney banner. The so-called "mother store", in Kemmerer, opened as the chain's second location in 1904. It still operates, as of 2018, albeit with shorter hours than many other locations, and is closed on Sundays.

In 1913, the company was incorporated under the new name, J. C. Penney Company, with William Henry McManus as a co-founder. In 1914, the headquarters was moved to [[New York City]] to simplify buying, financing, and transportation of goods.<ref>[http://www.jcpenney.net/Our-Old-Company/About-jcpenney/Our-History.aspx Our History] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130502084401/http://www.jcpenney.net/Our-Old-Company/About-jcpenney/Our-History.aspx |date=May 2, 2013 }} J.C. Penney. Retrieved August 20, 2013.</ref> By 1917, the company operated 175 stores in 22 states in the [[United States]]. J. C. Penney acquired The Crescent Corset Company in 1920, the company's first wholly owned subsidiary. In 1922, the company's oldest active private brand, Big Mac work clothes, was launched. The company opened its 500th store in 1924 in [[Hamilton, Missouri]], James Cash Penney's hometown. By the opening of the 1,000th store in 1928, gross business had reached $190 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|190000000|1928|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).

In 1940, [[Sam Walton]] began working at a J. C. Penney in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. Walton later went on to found future retailer [[Walmart]] in 1962.<ref name="Forbes269">{{cite book|first=Gross|last=Daniel|author2=[[Forbes|''Forbes'' Magazine]] Staff|date=August 1997|title=Greatest Business Stories of All Time|edition=First|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_0471196533/page/269 269]|isbn=0-471-19653-3|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_0471196533/page/269}}</ref> By 1941, J. C. Penney operated 1,600 stores in all 48 states. In 1956, J. C. Penney started national advertising with a series of advertisements in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. J. C. Penney credit cards were first issued in 1959.

In 1962, J. C. Penney entered discount merchandising with the acquisition of General Merchandise Company which gave them [[The Treasury (store)|The Treasury]]  stores. These discount operations proved unsuccessful and were shuttered in 1981. In 1963, J. C. Penney issued its first catalog. The company operated in-store catalog desks in eight states. The catalogs were distributed by the Milwaukee Catalog distribution center.

The company dedicated its first full-line, shopping center department store in 1961. This store was located at Black Horse Pike Center, in [[Audubon, New Jersey]]. The second full-line shopping center store was dedicated, at [[King of Prussia Plaza]], in [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania]] in late 1962. Those stores expanded the lines of merchandise and services that an average J. C. Penney carried to include appliances, sporting goods, tools, garden\lawn merchandise, restaurants, beauty salons, portrait studios, auto parts, and auto centers.

J. C. Penney expanded to include [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] in the 1960s. The company opened stores in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], Alaska in 1962. The [[J. C.

C. Penney "finished" its national expansion with the opening of its [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] store, at [[Ala Moana Center]] (all Hawaii stores were closed in 2003).  The Penney store at [[Plaza Las AmÃ©ricas]] mall in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], which opened in 1968, featured three levels and {{convert|261500|sqft}}. It was the largest J. C. Penney until a {{convert|300000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} store was dedicated at Greater Chicago's [[Woodfield Mall]] in 1971. The Woodfield Mall store served as the largest in the chain until a replacement store opened at Plaza Las AmÃ©ricas in 1998, which is {{convert|350000|sqft}} in size. In 1969, the company acquired [[Thrift Drug]], a chain of drugstores headquartered in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. It also acquired ''Supermarkets Interstate'', an [[Omaha]]-based food retailer which operated leased departments in J. C. Penney stores, The Treasury stores, and Thrift Drug stores.

In 1983, J. C. Penney discontinued its appliance, hardware, outdoor equipment, and auto center departments, and also sold its automotive centers to Firestone. Also in 1983, J. C. Penney began selling online through the [[Viewtron]] [[videotex]] service. That same year, fashion designer [[Halston|Roy Halston]], signed a six-year, $1 billion deal with J. C. Penney to sell a line of affordable clothing, accessories, cosmetics, and perfumes ranging in price from $24 to $200. The move was considered controversial then as no other high-end designer up to that point in time had licensed their designs to a mid-price retailer. The line, named Halston III, would not last long, as it would be poorly received and discontinued after about a year. However, the business move paved the way for other such high-end designers to sell their products at stores of varying price ranges in the future.<ref name="hyland">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/halston-j-c-penney-3068848|title=Halston's Penney's Serenade|last=Hyland|first=Veronique|date=May 12, 2010|publisher=wwd.com|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref> In 1984, J. C. Penney acquired the First National Bank of [[Harrington, Delaware]] and renamed it J. C. Penney National Bank. With the acquisition of the bank, the company became able to issue its own [[Mastercard|MasterCard]] and [[Visa Inc.]] cards. The company also began accepting [[American Express]] cards. Also that year, Thrift Drug began co-locating stores with [[Weis Markets]], and acquired many former [[Pantry Pride]] properties. In April 1987, the company announced that it was moving its headquarters to [[Plano, Texas]].<ref>"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&p_theme=saec&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F223124451CF5BF&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM When J.C.

C. Penney stores had discontinued sales of firearms. Before this point, J. C. Penney carried rifles and shotguns branded as J. C. Penney but produced by numerous established firearms manufacturers.
In the 80's JCPenny's also stopped selling outdoor equipment and hardware such as lawn mowers and tools.

The company headquarters in [[Plano, Texas]] broke ground in 1990 and was completed in 1992. When [[Sears]] closed its catalog business in 1993, J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Penney became the largest catalog retailer in the United States. In 1996, the company expanded its drug store business with the acquisition of [[Fay's Drug]] and Kerr Drug. These acquisitions momentum climaxed with the acquisition of the [[Eckerd Corporation|Eckerd]] chain in November. Fay's, Kerr, and Eckerd merged into J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Penney's drug store subsidiary Thrift Drug. Fay's, most Kerr, and Thrift drug stores were re-branded Eckerd in 1997. (Kerr Drug stores in [[The Carolinas]] remained branded as such because they were part of a group of stores that were divested because of trade competition issues raised during the merger.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrdrug.com/|title=Welcome to Walgreens â€“ Your Home for Prescriptions, Photos and Health Information|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913211008/http://kerrdrug.com/|archive-date=September 13, 2008}}</ref> On December 9, 1998, the [[The New York Times|Times]] reported J.

In 1996â€“1998, J. C. Penney entered Indonesia under partnership with Lippo Group under name ''J. C. Penney'' ''Collections'', which only featured fashion for men, women and kids. During its tenure, J. C. Penney only opened in Lippo Supermall (now Supermal Karawaci) and [[Mall Taman Anggrek|Mal Taman Anggrek]] in Jakarta. Both stores are closed due to [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|May 1998 riots]], with the Lippo Supermall store looted by the mass. Currently, the previous stores are occupied by [[Sogo|Sogo Department Store]] at Supermal Karawaci and [[Metro (department store)|Metro Department Store]] at Mal Taman Anggrek respectively.

The new slogan and associated ad campaign was launched in television commercials during the [[79th Academy Awards]] in late February 2007. After J. C. Penney sold off [[Eckerd Corporation|Eckerd]] in 2004, [[Brooks Eckerd Pharmacy|the locations that continued to operate as Eckerd]] (some locations in the [[Southern U.S.]] were sold to [[CVS Corporation]]) still had J. C. Penney Catalog Centers inside the stores (which was a carryover from locations that were once [[Thrift Drug]]) and also continued to accept J. C. Penney credit cards. After [[Rite Aid]] finalized its acquisition of Eckerd in 2007, the Catalog Centers inside the soon-to-be-converted stores permanently closed.

In June 2008, an ad called "Speed Dressing" emerged ending with the J. C. Penney logo and slogan "Every Day Matters". The ad won a prize at the [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]]. The ad was criticized for seeming to promote teen sex. J. C. Penney denied that the ad was theirs and their advertising agency [[Saatchi & Saatchi]] reported that it had been created by a third party vendor. It was entered in the competition by Epoch Films, who declined to comment.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121427510647899199 "J.C.

Marketing expert [[John Tantillo]] advised that the company distance itself from the commercial and also shed the publicity it engendered.<ref>[http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/06/26/brand-advisory.aspx "The Marketing Doctor Says: J.
