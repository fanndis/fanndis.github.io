{{NSA surveillance|1}}
"'''Stellar Wind'''" (or "'''Stellarwind'''") was the [[code name]] of a warrantless surveillance program begun under the [[George W. Bush administration]]'s [[President's Surveillance Program]] (PSP).<ref name =OIG1>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/27/nsa-inspector-general-report-document-data-collection NSA Inspector General report on the President's Surveillance Program], March 24, 2009, page 10, note 3.</ref> The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) program was approved by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] shortly after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] and was revealed by [[Thomas Tamm]] to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2004.<ref name=TimeMueller>[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2067995-2,00.html "Is the FBI Up to the Job 10 Years After 9/11?"] April 28, 2011</ref><ref name="newsweek1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/174601|title=The Fed Who Blew the Whistle: Is he a hero or a criminal?|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|date=December 13, 2008|work=Newsweek|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215105850/http://www.newsweek.com/id/174601|archivedate=December 15, 2008}}</ref> Stellar Wind was a prelude to new legal structures that allowed President Bush and President [[Barack Obama]] to reproduce each of those programs and expand their reach.<ref name=wapoarch>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-surveillance-architecture-includes-collection-of-revealing-internet-phone-metadata/2013/06/15/e9bf004a-d511-11e2-b05f-3ea3f0e7bb5a_story.html|title=U.S. surveillance architecture includes collection of revealing Internet, phone metadata|work=The Washington Post|date=June 16, 2013|first=Barton|last=Gellman}}</ref>

== Program scope ==
The program's activities involved [[data mining]] of a large database of the communications of American citizens, including e-mail communications, telephone conversations, financial transactions, and internet activity.<ref name="newsweek1"/> [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], a retired technical leader with the NSA, discussed some of the architectural and operational elements of the program at the [[Chaos Communication Congress|2012 Chaos Communication Congress]].<ref name="newsweek2">{{cite AV media |people=Binney, William |title=29C3 Panel: Jesselyn Radack, Thomas Drake, William Binney on whistleblowing and surveillance |medium=YouTube Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDM3MqHln8U |accessdate=June 9, 2013 |format=Flash |time=1:03:00 |publisher=Chaos Communication Congress |location=Hamburg, Germany}}</ref>

The intelligence community also was able to obtain from the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] suspicious activity reports, or "SARS", which are reports of activities such as large cash transactions that are submitted by financial institutions under anti-money laundering rules.<ref name="newsweek1" />

There were internal disputes within the [[U.S. Justice Department]] about the legality of the program, because data is collected for large numbers of people, not just the subjects of [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) warrants.<ref name="newsweek3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/174602|title=Now We Know What the Battle Was About|last=Klaidman|first=Daniel |date=December 13, 2008|work=Newsweek|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110001317/http://www.newsweek.com/id/174602|archivedate=January 10, 2010}} [http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/12/13/now-we-know-what-the-battle-was-about.html Alt URL]</ref><ref name =ars1>{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/07/what-the-ashcroft-hospital-showdown-on-nsa-spying-was-all-about/|title=What the Ashcroft 'Hospital Showdown' on NSA spying was all about|author=Sanchez, Julian|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=2013-07-29}}</ref> During the Bush Administration, the Stellar Wind cases were referred to by FBI agents as "pizza cases" because many seemingly suspicious cases turned out to be food takeout orders. According to then-[[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]], approximately 99% of the cases led nowhere, but "it's that other 1% that we've got to be concerned about".<ref name=TimeMueller/>

== 2004 conflict ==
From a report by the [[Office of Inspector General (United States)|inspectors general]] of six US intelligence agencies that was declassified in September 2015, it became clear that President Bush had originally authorized the collection of telephone and e-mail [[metadata]] only if one end of the communications was foreign or when there was a link to terrorism. But in 2004, the Justice Department found out that the NSA was apparently also collecting the metadata of purely domestic communications, after which President Bush declared that NSA had always been allowed to do so, but that analysts were only allowed to look at metadata related to terrorism. With this revised formulation, Bush reauthorized the program on March 11, 2004.<ref name=NYTimes2015-09-20/>

In 2004, the head of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] (OLC), [[Jack Landman Goldsmith]], wrote at least two legal memos authorizing the program, "We conclude only that when the nation has been thrust into an armed conflict by a foreign attack on the United States and the president determines in his role as commander in chief ... that it is essential for defense against a further foreign attack to use the [wiretapping] capabilities of the [National Security Agency] within the United States, he has inherent constitutional authority" to order warrantless wiretapping—"an authority that Congress cannot curtail," Goldsmith wrote in a 108-page memo dated May 6, 2004. In March 2004, the OLC concluded the e-mail program was not legal, and then-Acting Attorney General [[James Comey]] refused to reauthorize it.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=Legal memos released on Bush-era justification for warrantless wiretapping|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/legal-memos-released-on-bush-era-justification-for-warrantless-wiretapping/2014/09/05/91b86c52-356d-11e4-9e92-0899b306bbea_story.html|work=Washington Post|date=6 September 2014}}</ref>

== Revelations ==
In March 2012 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine published "The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)" talking about a vast new [[Utah Data Center|NSA facility in Utah]] and said, "For the first time, a former NSA official has gone on the record to describe the program, codenamed Stellarwind, in detail," naming the official William Binney, a former NSA code breaker. Binney went on to say that the NSA had highly secured rooms that tap into major switches, and satellite communications at both AT&T and Verizon.<ref name="Wired Magazine" >{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/1|title=The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)|last=Bamford|first=James|date=March 15, 2012|work=Wired|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}</ref> The article suggested that the supposedly-terminated Stellar Wind continues as an active program. This conclusion was supported by the exposure of [[Room 641A]] in AT&T's operations center in San Francisco in 2006.

In June 2013 the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' and the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' published an Office of the Inspector General ([[Office of Inspector General (United States)|OIG]]) draft report, dated March 2009, leaked by [[Edward Snowden]] detailing the Stellar Wind program.<ref name =OIG1/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/national-security-agency-inspector-general-draft-report/277/|title = NSA inspector general report on email and internet data collection under Stellar Wind|date= March 9, 2009|accessdate= August 1, 2013}}</ref> No doubt remained about the continuing nature of the surveillance program.

In September 2014 ''[[The New York Times]]'' asserted, "Questions persist after the release of a newly declassified version of a legal memo approving the National Security Agency's Stellarwind program, a set of warrantless surveillance and data collection activities secretly authorized after the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001]]." as an introductory headline summary with a link. The accompanying article addressed the release of a newly declassified version of the May 2004 memo.<ref>Savage, Charlie, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/redactions-in-us-memo-leave-doubts-on-data-surveillance-program.html?emc=edit_th_20140907&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=68634180&_r=0 "Redactions in U.S. Memo Leave Doubts on Data Surveillance Program"], ''The New York Times'', Sunday, September 7, 2014, p. A17</ref> Note was made that the bulk of the program—the telephone, internet, and e-mail surveillance of American citizens—remained secret until the revelations by [[Edward Snowden]], that to date, significant portions of the memo remain redacted in the newly released version, and that doubts and questions about its legality persist.
