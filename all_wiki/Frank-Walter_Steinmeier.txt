He was chairman-in-office of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) in 2016.

Steinmeier is a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), holds a doctorate in law and was formerly a career civil servant. He was a close aide of [[Gerhard Schröder]] when Schröder was [[Prime Minister of Lower Saxony]] during most of the 1990s, and served as Schröder's chief of staff from 1996. When Schröder became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1998, Steinmeier was appointed Under-Secretary of State in the [[German Chancellery]] with the responsibility for the [[intelligence service]]s. From 1999 to 2005 he served as [[German Chancellery Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff of the Chancellery]].

Following the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]], Steinmeier became [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] in the first [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] government of [[Angela Merkel]], and since 2007 he additionally held the office of vice chancellor. In 2008, he briefly served as acting chairman of his party. He was the SPD's candidate for chancellor in the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal election]], but his party lost the election and he left the federal cabinet to become leader of the opposition. Following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal election]], he again became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Merkel's second grand coalition. In November 2016 he was announced as the candidate of the governing coalition consisting of his own party and the [[CDU/CSU]] for [[President of Germany]], and thus became the presumptive electee as the coalition held a large majority in the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]]; he left the cabinet on 27 January 2017.<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/gabriel-takes-reins-at-german-foreign-ministry/a-37080162 Gabriel takes reins at German Foreign Ministry] ''Deutsche Welle'', 27 January 2017.</ref> He was [[2017 German presidential election|elected]] president by the Federal Convention on 12 February 2017 with 74% of the vote.

===Early life===
Steinmeier was born in 1956 in [[Detmold]].<ref>Judy Dempsey (17 October 2005), "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/17/world/europe/17iht-german.html A promotion to cabinet for Schröder's top aide]".

==Political career==

===Early career===
Steinmeier became an adviser in 1991 for Law of Communication media and media guidelines in the State Chancellery of [[Lower Saxony]] in [[Hanover]]. In 1993, he became director of the Personal Office for the prime minister of Lower Saxony, [[Gerhard Schröder]]. In 1996, he became the Undersecretary of State and director of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony.

===Chief of Staff of the Chancellery, 1999–2005===
Steinmeier was appointed in November 1998 as undersecretary of state at the office of the chancellor following [[1998 German federal election|Schröder's election victory]]. He replaced [[Bodo Hombach]] as the head of the [[German Chancellery|office of the chancellor]] in 1999.<ref name=ric23nov>{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Richard|title=Merkel Takes Office in Germany and Announces Coalition Cabinet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/23/international/europe/23germany.html|accessdate=7 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 November 2005}}</ref> During this period Steinmeier was also one of the advisors to Schröder.<ref name=ric23nov/> He was crucial in securing a red-green majority in parliament for Schröder's contentious "[[Agenda 2010]]" of economic reforms.<ref name="Frank-Walter Steinmeier"/> Because of his effective management beyond the spotlight of politics, he was nicknamed ''Die Graue Effizienz'' (The Grey Efficiency) &mdash;a pun on ''Graue Eminenz'', the German for [[éminence grise]].

Under Schröder, Steinmeier was responsible for co-ordinating Germany's intelligence services.<ref name="economist.com">[http://www.economist.com/node/5418144?zid=309&ah=80dcf288b8561b012f603b9fd9577f0e Schrödermeier: A foreign minister under pressure to account for the past] ''[[The Economist]]'', January 19, 2006.</ref> In 2003, he supported Schröder in his controversial decision to forge a coalition with Russia and France against the U.S.-led [[Iraq War|war against Iraq]].<ref>Judy Dempsey (May 17, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/17/world/europe/17iht-letter.1.5753291.html Letter From Europe: In German town, a foreign minister paves way for future] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> Meanwhile, he approved the decision to install a German intelligence officer in the Qatar-based office of General [[Tommy Franks]], the American commander of the U.S. invasion in Iraq, who passed on to the United States information being gathered in Baghdad by two German intelligence officers operating there.<ref>[[Richard Bernstein]] and [[Michael R.

In 2004, Steinmeier participated in diplomatic negotiations settling on compensation payments with Libya for victims of the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|1986 terrorist bombing of the LaBelle disco]] in Berlin.<ref>Charles Hawley (20 October 2005), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/letter-from-berlin-taming-the-lions-with-angela-merkel-a-380786.html Letter from Berlin: Taming the Lions with Angela Merkel] ''Bloomberg''.</ref>

A major controversy during Steinmeier's term as chief of staff was the imprisonment of a German-born Turk, [[Murat Kurnaz]], in [[Guantánamo Bay]] from 2002 until August 2006. Steinmeier denied during a parliamentary inquiry in March 2007 that he had blocked Kurnaz's release. Instead, he claimed that Berlin had feared Kurnaz was a threat and should go to Turkey, not Germany, if released. Only after Merkel's election was Kurnaz released and brought back to Germany.<ref>Judy Dempsey (17 May 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/17/world/europe/17iht-letter.1.5753291.html Letter From Europe: In German town, a foreign minister paves way for future] ''The New York Times''.</ref>

===First term as Foreign Minister, 2005–2009===
On 22 November 2005, after the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal elections]], Steinmeier became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the [[Merkel Cabinet I|Grand coalition cabinet]] led by [[Angela Merkel]].<ref name=ric23nov/> He was the first SPD Foreign Minister since [[Willy Brandt]] (1966–1969).

Upon taking office, Steinmeier led the preparations for Germany taking over the rotating [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]] in the first half of 2007.

Following [[Franz Müntefering]]'s departure from the cabinet on 21 November 2007, Steinmeier also filled the position of [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]].<ref>Andreas Cremer and Brian Parkin, [https://archive.today/20120525104505/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=avKnSh84M5yQ&refer=europe "Muentefering, Vice-Chancellor Under Merkel, Quits"], Bloomberg, 13 November 2007.</ref>

During his time in office, Steinmeier was widely regarded as having good working relations with Angela Merkel but often taking a different stance on foreign affairs.<ref name="Frank-Walter Steinmeier"/> By and large, he allowed Merkel to set the pace in foreign policy.,<ref name="economist.com"/> working harmoniously with her on a range of foreign policy issues, from confronting [[Iran]] over its nuclear program to negotiating binding goals to combat [[climate change]].<ref name="uk.reuters.com">Noah Barkin (23 September 2009), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/23/uk-germany-election-steinmeier-fb-idUKTRE58M2HT20090923 "Factbox - German SPD candidate Frank-Walter Steinmeier"], ''Reuters''.</ref> In one significant foreign-policy disagreement, Steinmeier held in 2009 that Germany should by 2013 lay the groundwork for withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan, a deployment that around two-thirds of Germans opposed by then.<ref name="German Challenger Gains an Edge">Markus Walker (14 September 2009), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125288315470307157 "German Challenger Gains an Edge"], ''The Wall Street Journal''.</ref> Unlike Merkel, he also favored Turkish entry into the [[European Union]].<ref name="uk.reuters.com"/>

Also, Steinmeier became known for his rather Russia-friendly stance, arguing strenuously for engagement with the increasingly assertive power to the east, rather than its isolation.<ref name="nytimes.com">Nicholas Kulish (5 September 2008), [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/world/europe/06germany.html Without Primaries or Caucuses, Campaign for German Chancellor Begins] ''The New York Times''.</ref> He formulated a policy toward Russia deliberately reminiscent of "[[Ostpolitik]]", the eastward-facing policy pioneered by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] in the early 1970s.<ref>Mark Landler (22 May 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/world/europe/22europe.html Putin Prompts Split in German Coalition], ''The New York Times''.</ref> Together with Gernot Erler, the SPD's leading Russia expert and the deputy foreign minister, Steinmeier initiated Germany's so-called Partnership for Modernization with Russia (announced in 2008), which became an official EU policy in 2010.<ref>Jakob Mischke and Andreas Umland (March 20, 2014), [http://mondediplo.com/blogs/germany-abandons-its-soft-approach-to-russia Germany abandons its 'soft' approach to Russia] ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''.</ref> Pressed by lawmakers to say more on his attitude toward Russia in the wake of the high-profile murders of opposition figures [[Anna Politkovskaya]] and [[Alexander Litvinenko]] at a 2007 hearing at the [[European Parliament]], Steinmeier stated that "[t]here is a certain trend toward [media] hysterics and one needs to get a sense of reason back into the debate".<ref>Andrew Rettman (23 January 2007), [http://euobserver.com/foreign/23329 Steinmeier sketches new EU policy on Central Asia] ''EUobserver''.</ref> In May 2008, he became the first foreign official to hold talks with [[President of Russia|President]] [[Dmitri Medvedev]] and [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]] after they took up their new positions following the [[2008 Russian presidential election|2008 presidential elections]].<ref>Judy Dempsey (15 May 2008), [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/15/world/europe/15briefs-GERMANFOREIG_BRF.html Russia: German Foreign Minister Visits], ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>

In 2006, ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' published an analysis of the state of US and Russian nuclear forces, concluding that post-Cold War US nuclear forces seemed designed to carry out a preemptive strike against Russia or China and that the planned missile defense would be valuable primarily in an offensive context as an adjunct to a US [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike#Destabilizing role of missile defense|first-strike]] capability.<ref name="www.foreignaffairs.com">Keir A.

In February 2009, Steinmeier became the first member of Merkel's cabinet to be received by the incoming [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]].<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-foreign-minister-to-meet-clinton-steinmeier-calls-for-new-trans-atlantic-agenda-a-605170.html "German Foreign Minister to Meet Clinton: Steinmeier Calls For 'New Trans-Atlantic Agenda'"], ''Spiegel Online'', 3 February 2009.</ref>

During his time in office, Steinmeier managed to extract German hostages from Iraq<ref>Geir Moulson (18 December 2005), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/18/AR2005121800356.html German Foreign Minister Confirms Hostage in Iraq Is Free] ''[[The Washington Post]]''.</ref><ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/05/2008410121815187481.html German hostages freed in Iraq] ''Al Jazeera'', 2 May 2006.</ref> and Yemen.<ref name="economist.com"/> In 2007, he also succeeded in securing the release of a German citizen who was imprisoned in Iran for illegally entering the country's waters on a fishing expedition.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2007/03/2008525142814231549.html "Iran releases German fisherman"], ''Al Jazeera'', 13 March 2007.</ref>

Steinmeier served as acting chairman of the SPD from 7 September 2008 to 18 October 2008. Domestically, throughout his term he was the only major politician with approval ratings consistently as high as or higher than Merkel's. This was helped by the especially high ratings foreign ministers generally receive in Germany.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

===Opposition leader, 2009–2013===
On 7 September 2008, following the resignation of SPD chairman [[Kurt Beck]], Steinmeier was chosen as the SPD candidate for chancellor for the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]] and also designated as acting SPD Chairman, pending the return of Müntefering to that position.<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/08/content_9840654.htm "German SPD party reshuffles leadership, with eye on election"], Xinhua, 7 September 2008.</ref> In his election campaign, he argued for new tax rules to deter high executive pay and bonuses, and for minimum wages to slow the growing gap between Germany's highest and lowest earners.<ref name="German Challenger Gains an Edge"/> He also focused on improving public healthcare.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/09/2009916122139147956.html Germany's parties and politicians], ''Al Jazeera'', 27 September 2009.</ref>

In late 2012, Steinmeier was once again considered a possible candidate to challenge Chancellor Angela Merkel in the 2013 general election, but soon withdrew from the contest. As a consequence, SPD chairman [[Sigmar Gabriel]] later announced that the leadership agreed to nominate [[Peer Steinbrück]].<ref>Melissa Eddy (28 September 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/world/europe/merkels-former-finance-minister-set-to-run-against-her.html Merkel's Ex-Finance Minister to Oppose Her] ''The New York Times''.</ref>

===Second term as Foreign Minister, 2013–2017===
[[File:Secretary Kerry Delivers Remarks With German Foreign Minister Steinmeier During a Working Dinner at the State Department (16582387597).jpg|thumbnail|Steinmeier with [[John Kerry]] in March 2015]]
After the [[2013 German federal election|elections of 2013]] and the new grand coalition government, Steinmeier was appointed foreign minister for a second time in December 2013. He replaced [[Guido Westerwelle]], who had signed the [[P5+1]] accord with Iran in November 2013. His deputies are [[Michael Roth (politician)|Michael Roth]] (SPD) and [[Maria Böhmer]] (CDU). Upon taking office, Steinmeier initiated an ambitious review of Germany's foreign policy, holding meetings nationwide and drawing in more than 12,000 people who work at the ministry or abroad.<ref>Alison Smale (19 November 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/world/europe/frank-walter-steinmeier-germanys-foreign-minister-a-man-in-the-middle.html Germany's Foreign Minister, a Man in the Middle – Frank-Walter Steinmeier Meets With Vladimir Putin], ''The New York Times''.</ref>

In light of criticism from the [[United States]], Steinmeier has stood firm on Germany's approach in the Ukraine conflict, where it was balancing support for European economic sanctions on Russia with leaving the door open to a revived partnership.<ref>Patrick Donahue (12 March 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-12/germany-blasts-republicans-in-u-s-on-iran-nuclear-talks Germany Blasts Republicans in U.S. on Iran Nuclear Talks] ''Bloomberg News''.</ref> In May 2014, he proposed a greater mediation role for the [[OSCE]], including the convening of local "round table" talks in Ukraine to defuse conflicts.<ref>[http://www.dw.de/ukraine-germany-calls-for-second-geneva-conference/a-17612046 Ukraine: Germany calls for second Geneva conference] ''Deutsche Welle'', 4 May 2014.</ref> Between 2015 and 2016, Steinmeier hosted a series of [[Normandy format]] meetings in Berlin to negotiate a solution of the [[War in Donbass|situation in the East of Ukraine]].<ref>[[Alison Smale]] (September 13, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/world/europe/parties-in-ukraine-conflict-are-urged-to-build-on-progress.html Guarded Optimism as Cease-Fire Holds in East Ukraine] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> During the [[Minsk II]] talks on a ceasefire for eastern Ukraine in early 2015, he successfully negotiated with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] on allowing German doctors to visit Ukrainian military pilot [[Nadiya Savchenko]], who had been on hunger strike for more than two months in a Russian jail.<ref>Alexandra Hudson (23 February 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/02/23/world/europe/23reuters-ukraine-crisis-savchenko-germany.html German Doctors Visited Detained Ukrainian Pilot in Russia] ''The New York Times''.</ref> Steinmeier has in the past repeatedly ruled out arms shipments to resolve the yearlong conflict.<ref>Patrick Donahue (11 March 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/merkel-s-top-diplomat-to-rebuff-u-s-call-to-arm-ukraine Merkel's Top Diplomat to Rebuff U.S. Call to Arm Ukraine] ''Bloomberg News''.</ref>

In 2015, Steinmeier hosted a meeting of the delegations from Libya's two rival governments, who were battling for control of the country, and United Nations Special Representative [[Bernardino León]] to discuss a UN-sponsored peace and power-sharing proposal despite splits among some of the parties.<ref>[https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Jun-11/301520-eu-leaders-push-libya-rivals-over-peace-deal.ashx EU leaders push Libya rivals over peace deal] ''The Daily Star'', 11 June 2015.</ref>

Steinmeier later was instrumental in convening the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) and the [[Syria peace talks in Vienna]] in October 2015, drawing together [[Saudi Arabia]]; its main regional rival, [[Iran]]; as well as [[Russia]], the [[United States]] and other Western powers and regional actors including [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]].<ref>Alison Smale (3 December 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/world/europe/germany-rebukes-its-own-intelligence-agency-for-criticizing-saudi-policy.html Germany Rebukes Its Own Intelligence Agency for Criticizing Saudi Policy] ''The New York Times''.</ref>

===Candidacy for President===
[[President of Germany|President]] [[Joachim Gauck]] announced in June 2016 that he would not run for re-election, resulting in a search for a candidate to succeed him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/06/german-president-joachim-gauck-merkel-east-german-civil-rights|author=Kate Connolly|title=Headache for Angela Merkel as German president Joachim Gauck steps down|work=The Guardian|date=6 June 2016 |access-date=7 June 2016}}</ref> In November 2016, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives agreed with the Social Democrats to support Steinmeier's candidacy for president in the [[2017 German presidential election|presidential election]], scheduled for 12 February 2017.<ref>Andreas Rinke and Andrea Shalal (14 November 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-president-idUSKBN1390V2 Steinmeier to swap German foreign ministry for presidency] ''Reuters''.</ref>

Merkel had originally wanted to nominate Green politician [[Marianne Birthler]], and as the CDU/CSU and the Greens control a majority in the Federal Convention, Birthler's election would have been secured. However, Birthler after some time decided not to run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/gauck-nachfolge-marianne-birthler-gab-angela-merkel-wohl-einen-korb/14862352.html|title=Marianne Birthler gab Angela Merkel wohl einen Korb|work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>

On 12 February 2017 Germany's 16th [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] elected Steinmeier President on the first ballot, with 931 votes out of a total of 1,260.

== Presidency 2017–present ==

Steinmeier took office as President of Germany on 19 March 2017, after the expiration of his predecessor's term in office, and he took on 22 March 2017 the oath that, in accordance with the Basic Law, newly invested presidents must take before a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.

=== German federal election 2017 ===
Following the [[2017 German federal election|federal election]] in September 2017, coalition talks began between the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]], [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]], [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] and [[Alliance 90/The Greens|the Green Party]]. The talks continued for 4 weeks until just past midnight on 20 November when the Free Democrats and their leader [[Christian Lindner]] walked out of the talks and they subsequently collapsed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42047532|title=Blow for Merkel as German talks collapse|date=2017-11-20|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-GB}}</ref> The collapse of the talks left another [[Grand coalition (Germany)|Grand Coalition]] as the only coalition with a majority in the Bundestag; this however seemed difficult, as the Leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] [[Martin Schulz]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/20/angela-merkel-has-few-options-left-to-govern-germany/|title=Analysis {{!}} Angela Merkel has few options left to govern Germany|last=Noack|first=Rick|date=2017-11-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> had ruled out another Grand Coalition on multiple occasions. In the following weeks, Steinmeier played an important role in the formation of the next government. This is because if the Bundestag fails to elect a chancellor in 14 days of voting,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faz.net/1.5300887|title=Mögliche Szenarien: Kommen jetzt Neuwahlen?|last=GmbH|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|date=2017-11-20|website=FAZ.NET|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> the president can either appoint the individual with most votes to lead a minority government or dissolve the Bundestag and call new elections. This type of political crisis had never been seen in Germany before and pushed the president into a quite powerful position which is rare for Germany. Steinmeier declared he would not consider a dissolution of the Bundestag as a preferable solution, and managed to persuade Schulz to meet with Angela Merkel and start preliminary talks. After long coalition talks, CDU, CSU and SPD formed a new grand coalition. Merkel was re-elected in the Bundestag on 14 March 2018.

==Political positions==

===Human rights===
In the past, ''[[Human Rights Watch]]'' has labeled Steinmeier as "[[Realpolitik]] advocate", for whom, "when it comes to defining his relationship with countries such as Russia and China, human rights play only a subordinate role".<ref>Wenzel Michalski (10 February 2014), [https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/02/10/second-chance-german-foreign-minister-steinmeier A Second Chance for German Foreign Minister Steinmeier] ''Human Rights Watch''.</ref>

In Steinmeier's opinion, the "[r]ejection of [[capital punishment]] is one of the keystones of German human-rights policy. The death penalty goes against our fundamental ethic and moral principles".<ref>[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/Presse/Meldungen/2009/091009-BM-Gegen-Todesstrafe.html Federal Minister Steinmeier on the World Day against the Death Penalty] Federal Foreign Office, press release of 9 October 2009.</ref> He personally called for the abolition of the [[Capital punishment in Uzbekistan|death penalty in Uzbekistan]]; capital punishment in Uzbekistan has been abolished since 2008.<ref>[http://www.dubai.diplo.de/Vertretung/dubai/en/03/HumanRights__seite.html Speech by Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to the German Bundestag on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights] Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Dubai, 5 December 2008.</ref> In April 2014, he summoned the Egyptian ambassador Mohamed Higazy after a [[2014 Minya court rulings|Cairo court]] sentenced 683 individuals to death for inciting violence during protests in summer 2013, following the military overthrow of elected President [[Mohammed Morsi]].<ref>Robert Hutton (3 February 2014), [http://www.dw.de/steinmeier-summons-egyptian-ambassador-after-mass-death-sentence/a-17601540 Steinmeier summons Egyptian ambassador after mass death sentence] ''Deutsche Welle'', 29 April 2014.</ref> Following the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], he warned that any move by Turkey to reinstate the death penalty would derail its efforts to join the European Union.<ref>Tom Körkemeier (18 July 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-security-germany-steinmeier-idUSB4N17M01K German formin: Death penalty would prevent Turkish EU membership] ''Reuters''.</ref>

In response to the [[2009–10 Iranian election protests|protests]] following the [[2009 Iranian presidential election]] against the disputed victory of [[President of Iran|Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], Steinmeier condemned what he called "brutal actions" against demonstrators in Tehran and summoned the Iranian ambassador [[Alireza Sheikhattar]] to explain.<ref>Dave Graham (14 June 2009), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/15/us-iran-election-germany-sb-idUSTRE55D1Z820090615 Germany summons Iranian ambassador over election] ''Reuters''.</ref>

===European integration===
After Germany had only narrowly managed to avoid a deficit warning from the [[European Commission]] in 2002, Schröder and Steinmeier became the driving forces behind weakening the [[Stability and Growth Pact]], a rule-based framework for the coordination of national fiscal policies originally intended as the guarantor of a stable euro.<ref>Christian Reiermann and Klaus Wiegrefe (16 July 2012), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/chancellor-gerhard-schroeder-key-in-weakening-the-euro-stability-pact-a-844458.html Chancellor Schröder's Legacy: Germany's Leading Role in Weakening the Euro] ''Der Spiegel''.</ref>

In a joint article in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' on 14 December 2010, Steinmeier and [[Peer Steinbrück]] proposed to solve the [[European debt crisis]] with "a combination of a haircut for debt holders, debt guarantees for stable countries and the limited introduction of European-wide bonds in the medium term, accompanied by more aligned fiscal policies".<ref>Peer Steinbrück and Frank-Walter Steinmeier (14 December 2010), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/effa001c-07ba-11e0-a568-00144feabdc0.html Germany must lead fightback] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> In February 2011, Steinmeier proposed Steinbrück as a candidate to lead the European Central Bank.<ref>Erik Kirschbaum (13 February 2011), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/02/13/uk-ecb-weber-steinbrueck-idUKTRE71C0VY20110213 Steinbrueck says not interested in ECB's top job] ''Reuters''.</ref>

Under Steinmeier's parliamentary leadership, the Social Democrats raised pressure on Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] to agree to more burden-sharing to stem the [[European debt crisis|euro zone crisis]], repeatedly calling on her to assume greater risks to avert a breakup of the single currency.<ref>Rainer Buergin (9 August 2012), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-09/merkel-s-spd-opposition-urges-more-german-crisis-burden-sharing German SPD Demands Merkel Backs More Crisis Burden-Sharing] ''Bloomberg Businessweek''.</ref> In both February and November 2012, his parliamentary group voted largely in favour of the Merkel government's proposal for [[Greek government-debt crisis|eurozone bailout packages for Greece]],<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17176616 Greece bailout: German MPs give strong backing] ''BBC News'', 27 February 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/11/2012113014469669490.html German parliament approves Greek bailout fund] ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', 30 November 2012.</ref><ref>Gareth Jones and Stephen Brown (30 November 2012), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/11/30/uk-eurozone-germany-greece-idUKBRE8AT0BY20121130 German lawmakers approve Greek bailout despite qualms] ''Reuters''.</ref> while criticizing the measures as being "not an enduring solution for the Greeks".<ref>Charles Hawley (30 November 2012), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-parliament-votes-to-approve-new-greece-aid-package-a-870259.html Squabbling in the Bundestag: German Parliament Rubber Stamps Aid for Greece] ''Spiegel Online''.</ref> In July 2014, he helped build the opposition's support for a euro zone rescue package for Spanish banks.<ref>Annika Breidthardt and Michelle Martin (20 July 2012), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/07/20/uk-eurozone-germany-vote-idUKBRE86I0XX20120720 Merkel wins Spanish aid vote with big majority] ''Reuters''.</ref> Later, as foreign minister, he publicly advised against "frivolous" talk of a [[Greek withdrawal from the eurozone]], calling for a serious search for a solution.<ref>Michelle Martin (14 April 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/14/eurozone-greece-mogherini-idUSB4N0RU00820150414 Mogherini says Europe must show flexibility on Greece] ''Reuters''.</ref>

Reacting to a growth of euro-skeptic political parties across Europe by early 2014, Steinmeier offered the [[United Kingdom]] limited support on renegotiating the [[Treaties of the European Union]], saying Germany wanted to see Britain's influence in the "midst" of the EU, not on "the sidelines".<ref>Robert Hutton (3 February 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-03/germany-offers-u-k-limited-support-on-eu-treaty-negotiation.html Germany Offers U.K. Limited Support on EU Treaty Negotiation] ''Bloomberg''.</ref> After Britain's vote to leave the EU in 2016, he argued that the union lacked the cohesion to undertake major new integration steps and should instead focus on migration, high youth unemployment and security.<ref>Andrea Shalal (13 September 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-germany-idUSKCN11J2BO Germany's Steinmeier against new integration push by EU] ''Reuters''.</ref>

At the same time, Steinmeier worked to develop new formats and revive new ones. In December 2014, he met with the foreign ministers from the three [[Nordic countries]] [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]] – [[Margot Wallström]], [[Erkki Tuomioja]] and [[Martin Lidegaard]] – for the so-called "N3 + 1" format to discuss issues of common concern for the first time.<ref>Mu Xuequan (2 December 2014), [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/europe/europe/2014-12/02/c_127267588.htm FMs from Germany, three Nordic countries meet first time in "N3 + 1" format] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217211709/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/europe/europe/2014-12/02/c_127267588.htm |date=2014-12-17 }} ''Xinhua News Agency''.</ref>

In August 2016, he joined French foreign minister [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] in pledging to "reinvigorate" the [[Weimar Triangle]] and published a document 'A strong Europe in a world of uncertainties'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/european-union/events/article/a-strong-europe-in-a-world-of-uncertainties-28-06-16|title=A strong Europe in a world of uncertainties|work=French Ministry of Foreign Affairs|date=28 June 2016}}</ref>

Between 2014 and 2016, he visited the three [[Baltic states]] – [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] – six times, the highest number of visits by any German Foreign Minister.<ref>Richard Milne (12 March 2014), [https://www.ft.com/content/9343f7d8-a97e-11e3-b87c-00144feab7de Crimea occupation casts shadow of 1940 over Baltic nations] ''Financial Times''.</ref><ref>Anton Troianovski (17 April 2015), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-seeks-to-counter-russian-propaganda-in-baltics-1429294362 Germany Seeks to Counter Russian 'Propaganda' in Baltics] ''The Wall Street Journal''.</ref>

Also in late 2014, Steinmeier and his British counterpart [[Philip Hammond]] united in a bid to end a deadlock in relations between [[Bosnia]] and the European Union, arguing that the EU should abandon its insistence on changes to Bosnia's electoral code as a precondition for a [[Stabilisation and Association Process|Stabilization and Association Agreement]] on the path to EU membership.<ref>Andrew Gardner (6 November 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/uk-germany-bid-to-change-eus-bosnia-policy/ UK, Germany bid to change EU's Bosnia policy] ''European Voice''.</ref>

===Energy policy===
In 2007, Steinmeier said he opposes European Commission proposals on unbundling the ownership of energy networks in the European Union, as it was proposed in the [[Third Energy Package]].<ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL2056183720070120 German minister opposes EU utility unbundling idea] ''Reuters'' 20 January 2007</ref>

===Relations with Russia===
[[File:Vladimir Putin and Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2016-03-23) 01.jpg|thumb|Steinmeier with [[Vladimir Putin]], 23 March 2016]]
In May 2007, the daily ''[[Financial Times Deutschland]]'' reported that Steinmeier had served as mediator in the so-called [[Bronze Night]] controversy, an Estonia-Russia dispute over the removal of a [[Red Army]] memorial in Tallinn. According to the report, Steinmeier suggested the Estonian ambassador to Russia, [[Marina Kaljurand]], go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation. Steinmeier called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to suggest not only that Kaljurand take a holiday, but also that Russia drop the dispute for the time being. After speaking with Lavrov, Steinmeier reportedly called Estonian Foreign Minister [[Urmas Paet]] and got him to agree to the deal. Kaljurand left Moscow for a two-week vacation and pro-Kremlin youth activists blockading the Estonian embassy in Moscow ended their protests the same day.<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/steinmeier-to-discuss-eu-russia-tensions-on-baltic-tour/a-2676177 Steinmeier to Discuss EU-Russia Tensions on Baltic Tour] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 10 July 2007.</ref>

Upon returning to government in late 2013, Steinmeier criticized Russia in his inaugural speech for exploiting Ukraine's economic plight to prevent it from signing the [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement]].<ref>Alexandra Hudson (17 December 2013), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/12/17/us-ukraine-germany-idUKBRE9BG0VZ20131217 New German minister criticizes Russia over Ukraine] ''Reuters''.</ref> In March 2014, he defended Russia's membership of the [[G8]], saying "The format of the G8 is actually the only one in which we in the West can speak directly with Russia."<ref>Thorsten Severin (2 March 2014), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/02/uk-ukraine-crisis-germany-g-idUKBREA210QA20140302 German foreign minister against excluding Russia from G8], ''Reuters''.</ref> When Germany held the chairmanship of the group in 2015, he maintained that excluding Russia over its actions in Ukraine was a necessary step but not a goal in itself; citing the [[Middle East]], he argued that "a look at the world shows that we need Russia as a constructive partner in a number of conflicts".<ref>Andreas Rinke (4 June 2015), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/uk-ukraine-crisis-germany-steinmeier-idUKKBN0OK1LK20150604 German minister says G7 should welcome back Russia longer term] ''Reuters''.</ref>

In a 2015 letter to [[Cecilia Malmström]], the EU's trade chief, Steinmeier proposed a joint declaration between the EU and Russia offering Moscow the prospect of long-sought investment and energy concessions to create a more integrated economic area from the Atlantic to the Pacific. According to the letter, "by the content of this declaration we could respond to Russia's wishes and begin a closer exchange of views on energy and investment protection issues, even if the [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement]] does not directly touch on them".<ref>Alex Barker, Stefan Wagstyl and Roman Olearchyk (1 December 2015), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4ee93654-9840-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc.html Germany pushes EU-Russia deal to avert Ukraine trade pact tension] ''Financial Times''.</ref>

===Relations with the United States===
Steinmeier voiced his support for [[Barack Obama]] when Obama was still a presidential candidate, and supported Obama's wish to deliver a speech before the iconic [[Brandenburg Gate]] during the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/machtwechsel-in-amerika/obama-und-das-brandenburger-tor-jetzt-hat-auch-steinmeier-einen-dalai-lama-1668939.html|title=Obama und das Brandenburger Tor: Jetzt hat auch Steinmeier einen Dalai Lama|first=Wulf|last=Schmiese|date=12 July 2008|work=FAZ.NET}}</ref>

===Relations with Central Asia===
During a 2006 meeting with Turkmen [[President of Turkmenistan|President]] [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], Steinmeier criticized [[Turkmenistan]] for its slow progress in implementing the [[rule of law]] and [[human rights]] and said that the state's progress in carrying out political reforms had been "too halting".<ref>Margarita Antidze (April 24, 2014), [http://www.dw.de/steinmeier-criticizes-central-asias-forgotten-dictatorship/a-2223590 Steinmeier Criticizes Central Asia's Forgotten Dictatorship], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', November 2, 2006.</ref>

When Germany chaired a United Nations group aimed at resolving [[2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis]], Steinmeier presented to the three conflict parties – Georgia, [[Abkhazia]] and [[Russia]] – a plan which included a three-stage peace proposal, entailing an end to violence, confidence-building measures over the following year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between Georgia and Abkhazia, and the return of about 250,000 Georgian refugees to Abkhazia. However, both Georgia and Abkhazia rejected the proposal.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2008/07/2008718103851933285.html Abkhazia rejects peace plan] ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', July 18, 2008.</ref> In September 2008, Steinmeier called for an international probe into the conflict over Georgia's breakaway provinces.<ref>[http://www.dw.de/steinmeier-calls-for-international-probe-into-georgia-conflict/a-3620822 Steinmeier Calls for International Probe Into Georgia Conflict] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', September 5, 2008.</ref> During a 2014 visit to the country, he reiterated that membership of [[NATO]] and of the [[EU]] would remain off the cards for a long while to come.<ref>Margarita Antidze (April 24, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/24/us-georgia-eu-idUSBREA3N1JE20140424 France, Germany show EU support for Georgia as Ukraine crisis mounts] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In August 2006, Steinmeier made his first visit to [[Afghanistan]], where Germany had taken over the command of the 21,000-strong NATO-led [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) shortly before.<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/steinmeier-reasserts-germanys-pledge-to-afghanistan/a-2142155 Steinmeier Reasserts Germany's Pledge to Afghanistan] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', August 21, 2006.</ref> Ahead of the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], Steinmeier – then still in his capacity as foreign minister – commissioned an internal report on Germany's engagement in Afghanistan which recommended that Germany should start pulling out of the country within four years; at the time, this was seen as a stark departure from Steinmeier's earlier insistence Germany should not set a date for withdrawing its then 4,200-strong contingent from the north of Afghanistan as the move could play into the hands of Taliban insurgents.<ref>Bertrand Benoit (September 13, 2009), [https://web.archive.org/web/20141214155804/http://www.ft.com.financialtimes.han.w-hs.de/intl/cms/s/0/536d7a88-a093-11de-b9ef-00144feabdc0.html Steinmeier shifts stance on troop pullout] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

In October 2014, Steinmeier visited both [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] to facilitate a negotiated solution to the long-standing conflict over [[Nagorny Karabakh]], a region of Azerbaijan controlled by [[Armenians|ethnic Armenians]].<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/11/armenia-warns-azeris-over-helicopter-shooting-20141112173518607733.html Armenia warns Azeris over helicopter shooting] ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', November 12, 2014.</ref> In 2016, he returned to both countries to in his capacity as chairman of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) to reinvigorate the talks.<ref>Chase Winter (June 29, 2016), [http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-top-diplomat-seeks-solutions-in-armenia-azerbaijan-conflict/a-19367766 Germany's top diplomat seeks solutions in Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref>

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
In the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], Steinmeier supports a [[two-state solution]] and calls for an end to the Israeli occupation of the [[Palestinian territories]]. He welcomed the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334]] and said the [[Israeli settlements]] on occupied territory is an obstacle to peace and a two-state solution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/israel-empoert-ueber-usa-steinmeier-begruesst-un-resolution-gegen-siedlungsbau/19175438.html|title=Steinmeier begrüßt UN-Resolution gegen Siedlungsbau}}</ref> He further said that "a democratic Israel is only achievable through a two-state-solution".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/German-foreign-minister-says-settlements-jeopardize-peace-476923|title=In strong attack on Israel, German foreign minister says settlements jeopardize peace}}</ref> Steinmeier praised the speech by US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] which outlined the United States' position on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in December 2016; in the speech Kerry said a peace agreement must be based on the 1967 lines, that all citizens must enjoy equal rights, that occupation must end, that the Palestinian refugee issue must be resolved, and that Jerusalem must be the capital of both states, and criticised the Netanyahu government's agenda as driven by "extreme elements".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/ausland/internationale-politik/id_79937014/steinmeier-verteidigt-us-aussenminister-gegen-kritik-aus-israel.html|title=Steinmeier verteidigt US-Außenminister Kerry}}</ref>

Steinmeier is a staunch proponent of the [[Iran nuclear deal framework]], and has called the agreement "an opening for further diplomatic endeavors".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-steinmeier-nuclear-deal-opening-for-mideast-diplomacy/a-18789086|title=Germany's Steinmeier: Nuclear deal 'opening' for Mideast diplomacy – 17.10.2015 |website=Deutsche Welle}}</ref>

===Relations with the Arab world===

In March 2015, Steinmeier said he "can understand" [[Saudi Arabia]]'s decision to mount a [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|military intervention in Yemen]] and acknowledged the operation had "support from the region". However, he said the crisis could not be solved by violence and urged a negotiated solution.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/182464/germany-understands-saudis-39-military-action-in-yemen.html|agency=The Journal of Turkish Weekly|title=Germany 'understands' Saudis' military action in Yemen|date=28 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407033207/http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/182464/germany-understands-saudis-39-military-action-in-yemen.html|archive-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>

===Relations with Africa===
Steinmeier has made the African continent the destination of many foreign trips. On his first visit as Germany's foreign minister in 2006, his tour to [[Libya]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]] and [[Mauritania]] was aimed at preparing Germany for its [[President of the European Union|presidency of the EU]] and the [[G8]] the following year.<ref>[http://www.dw.de/steinmeier-clinches-debt-repayment-deal-on-north-africa-tour/a-2240155 Steinmeier Clinches Debt Repayment Deal on North Africa Tour] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', November 16, 2006.</ref> In August 2007, he travelled to [[Nigeria]] and [[Ghana]]. In February 2008, he made a three-day visit to [[Ghana]] (on the occasion of the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]]), [[Togo]] and [[Burkina Faso]]. Over the course of 2014, Steinmeier visited [[Ethiopia]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Angola]]; [[Nigeria]] and [[Tunisia]] (with his French counterpart [[Laurent Fabius]]); and [[South Africa]] (for the 8th South Africa-Germany Bi-National Commission). In 2015, he made official trips to [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]]; to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Kenya]]; [[Egypt]]; and [[Mozambique]], [[Zambia]] and [[Uganda]].

In June 2007, Steinmeier and EU Commissioner [[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]] flew to [[Benghazi]], [[Libya]], to try to advance efforts to free six foreign medics [[HIV trial in Libya|sentenced to death for infecting 426 Libyan children with HIV]].<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2007/06/20085251257250998.html Libya talks raise hopes in HIV case] ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', June 11, 2007.</ref>

Later that year, Steinmeier summoned the Zimbabwean ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' and stated that comments in state-run newspaper ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|The Herald]]'' referring to German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] as a "[[Nazi]]" were unacceptable; Merkel had previously confronted [[Human rights in Zimbabwe|human rights abuses in Zimbabwe]].<ref>Fred Attewill (December 11, 2007), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/11/germany.zimbabwe Zimbabwe's 'Nazi' slur on chancellor rankles Berlin] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>

Since becoming a member of the German Bundestag, Steinmeier has voted in favor of German participation in [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeeping missions]] as well as in United Nations-mandated European Union peacekeeping missions on the African continent, such as in [[Operation Atalanta|Somalia]] (2009, 2010, 2011, 2014 and 2015), [[African Union – United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur|Darfur/Sudan]] (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016), [[United Nations Mission in South Sudan|South Sudan]] (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016), [[United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali|Mali]] (2013 and 2014), the [[EUFOR RCA|Central African Republic]] (2014), and [[United Nations Mission in Liberia|Liberia]] (2015). In 2012 and 2013, however, he voted against German participation in [[Operation Atalanta]] in Somalia.

===Relations with Greece===
Steinmeier has rejected claims for [[war reparations]] from the Greek [[Syriza]] party in response to Germany's position on the [[Greek government-debt crisis]]. When incoming Greek [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Alexis Tsipras]], in his first major speech to parliament in early 2015, pledged to seek war reparations from Germany, Steinmeier replied to Greek [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Foreign Minister]] [[Nikos Kotzias]] that Germany was fully aware of its political and moral responsibility for the "terrible events" in Greece between 1941 and 1944 when German troops occupied the country. "Still, we are firmly convinced that all reparations issues, including forced loans, are judicially settled once-and-for-all," Steinmeier said.<ref>Michael Nienaber (February 10, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/02/10/world/europe/10reuters-greece-germany-reparations.html Greek Foreign Minister Takes War Reparations Claim to Berlin, Gets Rebuffed] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>

==Controversies==

=== Refusal to meet with Dalai Lama ===
Steinmeier openly attacked Merkel over her 2007 meeting with the [[Dalai Lama]], accusing the chancellor of "playing to public opinion" without regard for the effectiveness of the meeting in improving political or religious rights on the ground in [[China]].<ref>Hugh Williamson (November 16, 2007), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/facf3146-93ce-11dc-acd0-0000779fd2ac.html Beijing forces Steinbrück to cancel visit] ''[[Financial Times]]''</ref> In 2008, he refused to meet the Dalai Lama during his five-day visit, arguing that such a meeting could undermine international efforts to promote sustained contact between China and [[Tibet]].<ref>James Blitz and Hugh Williamson (May 20, 2008), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c4ef02e2-2607-11dd-b510-000077b07658.html UK visit by Dalai Lama irks China] ''[[Financial Times]]''</ref> Instead, Steinmeier issued the statement "it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the Dalai Lama these days", which ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as "extraordinarily cynical" and accused Steinmeier of prioritizing business interests over human rights.<ref name="nytimes2008">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/opinion/20iht-edgermany.4.13058304.html|title=Steinmeier's bad example|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 May 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,553844,00.html German Minister Criticized for Planned Meeting with Dalai Lama].

=== Murat Kurnaz torture case ===
In the case of [[Murat Kurnaz]], innocently imprisoned in 2002 and tortured by the US, Steinmeier allegedly had an offer by the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[CIA]] already in September 2002 regarding a transfer of Murat Kurnaz to Germany, where he was born and raised. Kurnaz had been first sold as a terror suspect in Pakistan, then imprisoned in Afghanistan and later in [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], Cuba, until 2006. By refusing the offer Steinmeier is thought to have been politically directly responsible for his continued imprisonment.<ref>[http://www.dradio.de/aktuell/585439/ Berlin lehnte Kurnaz-Freilassung ab], [[Deutschlandfunk]] 23.

=== Armenian Genocide denial ===
{{Main|Armenian Genocide denial}}
During a 2015 debate about Germany's [[Armenian Genocide recognition|recognition of the Armenian Genocide]] on the occasion of its [[100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide|centenary]], Steinmeier was the politician most reluctant to endorse it, mainly because of Germany's relations with [[Turkey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/deutsch/europa/2016/05/16/steinmeier-fuerchtet-wegen-armenien-beschluss-um-beziehungen-zu-tuerkei|title=Steinmeier fürchtet wegen Armenien-Beschluss um Beziehungen zu Türkei}}</ref> He was widely criticized for his position and accused of [[Armenian Genocide denial]].<ref name="HenrykBroder">{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article140082537/Herr-Steinmeier-Sie-haben-von-nichts-eine-Ahnung.html|title=Völkermord: Herr Steinmeier, Sie haben von nichts eine Ahnung!|author=Henryk M.

===Plagiarism allegations===
Following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 elections]], Steinmeier became the first prominent member of the Social Democrats to be confronted with allegations that he [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] parts of his 1991 doctoral dissertation about the role of the state in the prevention of homelessness.<ref name="Melissa Eddy 2013" /> Similar accusations had previously led to the resignation of two ministers of the Merkel government.<ref name="Melissa Eddy 2013" /> In response, Steinmeier rejected the charges and said that he had asked the [[University of Giessen]] to check his dissertation for unacknowledged citations.<ref name="Melissa Eddy 2013"/> In May 2013, a university committee for safeguarding academic practices found that Steinmeier had no fraudulent intent and had not committed academic misconduct in his dissertation.<ref name=DW>{{cite news |date=May 11, 2013 |title=German university rejects plagiarism allegations against Steinmeier |url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-university-rejects-plagiarism-allegations-against-steinmeier/a-17205123 |work=DW.com |location=Bonn, Germany}}</ref> The committee did find "technical weaknesses" in Steinmeier's citations, but said they were not severe enough to consider revoking his degree.<ref name="DW"/>
