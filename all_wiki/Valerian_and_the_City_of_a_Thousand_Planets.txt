==Plot==
In the 28th century, due to cooperation between the Earth's countries (beginning with the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project|ASTP]] of 1975) and extraterrestrial peoples, the former [[International Space Station]] has been expanded until its mass threatens to cause it to fall out of [[Low Earth orbit|orbit]]. Relocated to deep space using thrusters, it becomes Alpha, a space-traveling city inhabited by millions of species from thousands of planets. A special police division is created by the United Human Federation (a [[world government]] formed by a federation of Earth's countries) to preserve peace through the galaxy, including arrogant, happy-go-lucky [[Major]] [[Valérian|Valerian]] and his partner, no-nonsense [[Sergeant]] [[Laureline]].

En route to a mission, Valerian dreams of a planet, Mül, where a low-tech [[humanoid]] race lives peacefully. They fish for pearls containing enormous amounts of energy, and use small animals to replicate them. Wreckage begins plummeting from the sky, followed by a huge spacecraft that falls and causes an explosion that annihilates every living being on the planet. Some of the sentient inhabitants enter a discarded vessel and accidentally trap themselves inside, but the planet's young princess Lihö-Minaa is stranded outside. Just before her death, she conveys a [[telepathic]] message.

Shaken, Valerian awakes. After an argument with Laureline regarding their relationship, analysis reveals he might have received a signal from across time and space. He learns that his mission is to retrieve a "Mül converter," so-called for being able to replicate anything it eats. It is the last of its kind, and currently in the hands of [[black market]] dealer Igon Siruss. Before setting out, Valerian asks Laureline to marry him, but she brushes him off due to his aversion to commitment and his numerous affairs with colleagues.

On planet Kirian, Valerian disrupts a meeting, in a zone forbidden to humans, between Igon and two hooded figures who resemble the humanoids from his vision. They also seek the converter, the small animal in his vision. Valerian and Laureline recover the converter and surreptitiously steal one of the energy pearls. Aboard their ship, Valerian learns that Mül was destroyed 30 years earlier, and all information about it is classified.

They return to Alpha where the frosty station commander, Arün Filitt, informs them that the center of the station has been invaded by an unknown force, rendering it highly toxic. Troops sent into the area have not returned, and the infection is growing. Laureline and Valerian are assigned to protect the commander during an interstation summit to discuss the crisis; against the commander's wishes, Laureline maintains possession of the converter.

During the summit, unidentified humanoids suddenly attack, incapacitating everyone and kidnapping Filitt. Valerian chases the kidnappers on foot, in his spacecraft, and then in his [[Lexus]] SkyJet aircraft to the infected area and crashes the plane. Desperate for news of her partner and evading arrest for insubordination, Laureline enlists opportunistic aliens known as Dogan Daguis for help to track Valerian, and finds him unconscious at the edge of the infected zone. She rouses him, but is kidnapped by a primitive tribe, the Boulan Bathors of the planet Goara whose colony is nearby, and presented at their emperor's dinner as the choice course. Valerian infiltrates the tribe's territory with the help of the shape-shifting Glamopod entertainer Bubble, who he met in the [[red-light district]], Paradise Alley. They rescue Laureline and escape, but Bubble is mortally wounded. Before dying, she tells Valerian not to give up on his feelings for Laureline.

Valerian and Laureline venture further into the infected area, discover it is not toxic, and that it contains the remains of some antique spacecraft. They reach a large shielded hall where they find the humanoids, known as the Pearls, with an unconscious Filitt. The Pearls's leader, Emperor Haban Limaï, explains that his people lived peacefully on Mül until an orbital battle occurred between the Federation and a faction known as Southern Territories. Filitt, the human commander, ordered the use of three powerful [[Thermonuclear weapon|fusion missiles]] that disabled the enemy ship and sent it crashing into the planet, annihilating Mül. Upon her passing, Princess Lihö-Minaa transferred her soul into Valerian's body.

When the surviving Pearls were trapped in a downed space vehicle from the battle, they managed to repair it and learned the humans' technology and history. They eventually came to Alpha, helped by some merchants, where they assimilated more knowledge and built a ship of their own by stealing parts from Alpha's various civilizations. They needed only the converter and the pearl to launch the ship so they could find a planet to use their technology to recreate their homeworld. Filitt admits his role in the genocide, but argues it was necessary to end the war—as was the coverup, to prevent humans from being expelled from Alpha. Valerian and Laureline disagree, arguing that the commander is trying to avoid the consequences of his actions. When Filitt becomes belligerent, Valerian knocks him out.

Valerian hands over the pearl he stole, and Laureline persuades him to return the converter too, despite their orders. While the Pearls prepare their spacecraft for takeoff, Filitt's pre-programmed K-Tron robot soldiers attack the Pearls, the government soldiers sent to assist Valerian, and their support staff, but are ultimately defeated. The spacecraft departs and Filitt is arrested. Valerian and Laureline are left adrift aboard a still-working [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] identified by radio technicians as ''[[Destiny (ISS module)#In media|Destiny 2005]]'', and Laureline finally answers Valerian's marriage proposal with a "maybe" as they wait for rescue.

==Production==
===Development===
Although Luc Besson loved the Valerian comics growing up, he did not seriously consider adapting them into a movie until he was working on ''[[The Fifth Element]].'' During development, Besson had tapped Valerian illustrator [[Jean-Claude Mézières]] to work on the film, who asked Besson, "Why are you doing this shitty film? Why you don’t do Valerian?"<ref name="Deadlineimpossible">{{cite web|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike Jr|title=Luc Besson Lays It On The Line For Passion Pic ‘Valerian’ — Deadline Disruptors|url=https://deadline.com/2017/05/valerian-luc-besson-stx-europacorp-disruptors-interview-news-1202092174/|website=Deadline|accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref> At the time, Besson felt that making the film was "impossible" given the vast alien-to-human ratio.<ref name="Deadlineimpossible"/> The release of ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' served as both a blessing and a curse for Besson; he has said, "technically, I could see that we can do everything now. The film proved that imagination is the only limit." However, he also felt that "[[James Cameron]] pushed all the levels so high", which made him believe that his script was not good enough, so he rewrote it.<ref name="Deadlineimpossible"/> Ultimately, the [[storyboarding]] for the film took seven months.<ref name=":0" />

The project was first publicly reported in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Keslassy|first1=Elsa|title=Luc Besson to write-direct ‘Valerian’ adaptation|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/luc-besson-to-write-direct-valerian-adaptation-1118056115/|website=Variety|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> The two principal stars, [[Dane DeHaan]] and [[Cara Delevingne]], were announced in May 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hipes|first1=Patrick|title=Luc Besson To Direct ‘Valerian’ In Return To Sci-Fi Roots|url=https://deadline.com/2015/05/luc-besson-valerian-movie-europacorp-1201425149/|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=deadline.com|date=12 May 2015}}</ref> On 19 August 2015, [[Clive Owen]] signed on to play Commander Arün Filitt in the film.<ref name=OwenCast>{{cite news|last1=Fleming Jr|first1=Mike|title=Clive Owen Set By Luc Besson For ‘Valerian’|url=https://deadline.com/2015/08/clive-owen-valerian-luc-besson-1201501904/|accessdate=23 August 2015|work=deadline.com|date=19 August 2015}}</ref> The budget, €197 million, is by far the largest ever assembled for a French film. Previously, ''[[Asterix at the Olympic Games (film)|Asterix at the Olympic Games]]'' was the most expensive, at €78 million, just ahead of Besson's ''The Fifth Element'' (€75 million).<ref name=Aug2015F>{{cite news|title=Luc Besson threatens to film ‘Valerian’ abroad over French tax credits|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20150826-france-director-luc-besson-threatens-film-valerian-abroad-over-tax-credits|accessdate=10 January 2016|work=France 24|date=26 August 2015}}</ref> By the end of August 2015, Besson said in an RTL radio interview that shooting the film in France was too expensive. Because it was filmed in a foreign language (English), Besson was unable to benefit from [[tax credit]]s, despite preferring to produce the film in France and create jobs for 1,200 crew members.<ref name="Aug2015F" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Richford|first1=Rhonda|title=Luc Besson's 'Valerian' to Shoot in France After Incentives Tweak (Report)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/luc-bessons-valerian-shoot-france-822891|accessdate=10 January 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=14 September 2015}}</ref> The criteria to obtain these tax credits were then adapted accordingly.

David Ehrlich of [[IndieWire]] gave the film a grade of B-, praising how "unapologetically [[idiosyncratic]]" the film is, while also saying "the vividness of this place only underscores the lifelessness of the people leading us through it .... There are 394 million stories on the City of a Thousand Planets, and Valerian’s might be the only one we’ve seen before.

[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave a negative review, saying: "[[Golden Raspberry Awards|The Razzies]] don't need to wait until the end of the year to anoint a winner for 2017 ...
