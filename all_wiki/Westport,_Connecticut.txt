==History==
[[File:Old Map of Westport, CT.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Old map of Westport]]The earliest known inhabitants of the Westport area as identified through archaeological finds date back 7,500 years.<ref name="Klein(Conn.)2000.1.15" /> Records from the first white settlers report the [[Pequot]] Indians living in the area which they called ''Machamux'' translated by the colonialists as ''beautiful land''.<ref name="Prevost2001" /> Settlement by colonialists dates back to the five ''[[Bankside Farmers]]''; whose families grew and prospered into a community that continued expanding. The settlers arrived in 1693, having followed cattle to the isolated area.<ref name="Prevost2001" /> The community had its own ecclesiastical society, supported by independent civil and religious elements, enabling it to be independent from the Town of Fairfield.<ref name="Somerset-Ward2005" /> As the settlement expanded its name changed: it was briefly known as "Bankside" in 1693, officially named [[Greens Farms|Green's Farm]] in 1732 in honor of Bankside Farmer John Green and in 1835 incorporated as the Town of Westport.<ref name="Klein(Conn.)2000.1.15" /><ref name="Jennings.148">{{cite book|last=Jennings|pages=148}}</ref>[[File:Minuteman, Westport CT.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|[[Minutemen]] Statue on [[Compo Beach]]]]

Agriculture was Westport's first major industry. By the 19th century, Westport had become a shipping center in part to transport onions to market.

Starting around 1910 the town experienced a cultural expansion.<ref name="Klein(Conn.)2000.1.15" /><ref name="Inc1949"/> During this period artists, musicians, and authors such as [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] moved to Westport to be free from the commuting demands experienced by business people.<ref name="Klein(Conn.)2000.119.146" /> The roots of Westport's reputation as an arts center can be traced back to this period during which it was known as a "creative heaven."<ref name="Klein(Conn.)2000.1.15" />

In the 20th century, a combination of industrialization and popularity among New Yorkers attracted to fashionable Westport—which had attracted many artists and writers—resulted in farmers selling off their land. Westport changed from a community of farmers to a suburban development.<ref name="Congress1871">{{cite book|author=United States.

==Transportation==
[[File:WestportCTTrainStation09302007.jpg|thumb|[[Westport station (Connecticut)|Westport train station]]]]
[[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]], the [[Merritt Parkway]], and [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S. 1]], as well as the [[Saugatuck River]], run through Westport.

Westport has two train stations, [[Green's Farms (Metro-North station)|Green's Farms]] and [[Westport (Metro-North station)|Westport]] on the [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]], which serves [[Stamford Transportation Center|Stamford]] and [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York City or [[Union Station (New Haven, Connecticut)|New Haven-Union Station]]. This line is shared with [[Amtrak]] trains as it is part of the [[Northeast Corridor]], but no Amtrak services stop at Green's Farms or Westport. The nearest Amtrak stations are at [[Bridgeport (Metro-North station)|Bridgeport]] (10 miles) and Stamford (12 miles).

=== "Main to Train" study ===
A recent initiative by residents of the Town of Westport, Connecticut, culminating in a 2019 report.<ref>{{cite web |title=Westport Main to Train Study Recommendations Report |url=https://westcog.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FINAL-Main-to-Train-Recommendations-Report-08272019.pdf |publisher=WestCOG |accessdate=18 September 2020}}</ref> It is part of a greater interest to improve pedestrian and cyclist options from the major places of interest in town: downtown Westport to the Westport Train Station. This approximate two-mile stretch of road is most directly accessible via Post Road East ([[U.S. Route 1]]) to Riverside Avenue. The third iteration of the study will more specifically address ways in which this path can be improved for people not traveling by car; the first report considered the conditional state of the path and the second analyzed traffic conditions.

The Westport Planning and Zoning Commission<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westportct.gov/government/elected-officials/planning-and-zoning-commission|title=Planning and Zoning Commission &#124; Westport, CT|website=www.westportct.gov}}</ref> is interested in offering more sustainable and accessible transit options: in 2017 the Commission released a report on alternate transit options,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westportct.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=11626|title=ENHANCE PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE AND TRANSIT OPTIONS|website=Town of Westport}}</ref> complete with surveys of town residents and maps of current sidewalks and bike paths. The lack of sidewalks on some two-way arterial and many collector streets may increase the potential for accidents. This is occurring in tandem with the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]]’s notable laws which support users of all transit forms: the [[Complete streets|Complete Streets]] Law of 2009,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2009/ACT/PA/2009PA-00154-R00SB-00735-PA.htm|title=Substitute Senate Bill No. 735: Public Act No. 09-154: AN ACT IMPROVING BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN ACCESS.|date=2009-06-30|website=www.cga.ct.gov|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> the 2014 Vulnerable User Law,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2014/act/pa/pdf/2014PA-00031-R00SB-00336-PA.pdf|title=Senate Bill No. 336: Public Act No. 14-31: AN ACT CONCERNING THE PENALTY FOR CAUSING HARM TO A VULNERABLE USER OF A PUBLIC WAY.|date=2014-05-16|website=www.cga.ct.gov|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> and the 2015 Bike Bill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2015/act/pa/pdf/2015PA-00041-R00SB-00502-PA.pdf|title=Substitute Senate Bill No. 502: Public Act No. 15-41: AN ACT CONCERNING BICYCLE SAFETY.|date=2015-06-15|website=www.cga.ct.gov|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> A true application of change in the post-Complete Streets law is the restriping of road shoulders by the DOT across the state, including the many, already narrow, two-way streets. The narrowing of roads<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/mission/health/Traffic-Calming-to-Slow-Vehicle-Speeds|title=Traffic Calming to Slow Vehicle Speeds|date=2015-08-24|website=US Department of Transportation|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> is known to encourage slower, safer driving, which protects pedestrians and cyclists, as well as auto users. This form of traffic calming is thus in line with [[Vision Zero]], an interest by [[New Urbanism|New Urbanists]] and city planners focused on reducing traffic-caused injuries and fatalities.

The [[Norwalk Transit District]], with several routes available for Westporters due to support by the Town of Westport, offers another form of transit for mainly commuting use.
