The '''Cebuano language''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɛ|ˈ|b|w|ɑː|n|oʊ}}), colloquially referred to by most of its speakers simply as '''Bisaya''' or '''Binisaya''' (translated into English as ''Visayan'', though it should not be confused with other [[Visayan languages]]),{{refn|Reference to the language as ''Binisaya'' is discouraged by many linguists, in light of the many languages within the Visayan language group that might be confounded with the term.}} is an [[Austronesian language family|Austronesian language]], spoken in the southern [[Philippines]]. Specifically, it flourishes in [[Central Visayas]], western parts of [[Eastern Visayas]] and on most of [[Mindanao]]. It originated on the island of [[Cebu]], and now is spoken primarily by various [[Visayans|Visayan ethnolinguistic groups]] who are native to those areas, primarily the [[Cebuano people|Cebuanos]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ceb |title=Cebuano |website=Ethnologue |language=en |access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> While Filipino (i. e., [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) has the largest number of ‘’speakers‘’ among the languages of the Philippines, Cebuano had the largest ‘’native-language-speaking’’ population in the Philippines, from the 1950s until about the 1980s.<ref name="gruyter">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMZm0w0k1c4C |title=Sociolinguistics: An International Handbook of the Science of Language and Society |last1=Ammon |first1=Ulrich |last2=Dittmar |first2=Norbert |last3=Mattheier |first3=Klaus J. |last4=Trudgill |first4=Peter |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2006 |isbn=9783110184181 |volume=Volume 3 |page=2018 |language=en}}</ref> It is by far the most widely spoken of the [[Visayan languages]] (which are in turn part of the wider genus of [[Philippine languages]]).{{citation needed lead|date=July 2020}}

Cebuano is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Central Visayas, western parts of Eastern Visayas, some western parts of [[Palawan]] and most parts of [[Mindanao]]. The name Cebuano is derived from the island of [[Cebu]], which is the [[Urheimat|original locus]]  of the language.<ref name="Wolff 1972" /><ref name="Ceb2" /> Cebuano is also the primary language in Western Leyte — noticeably in [[Ormoc]], and in other municipalities surrounding the city; most of the residents in the area refer to the Cebuano language by their own [[demonym]]s, for example, as "Ormocanon" in Ormoc, and as "Albuerahanon" in [[Albuera, Leyte|Albuera]].<ref name="COTFE">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/ChurchOfTheFarEastPreview |title=Church of the Far East |year=2016 |last=Pangan |first=John Kingsley |publisher=St. Pauls |location=Makati |pages=19}}</ref> Cebuano is assigned the [[ISO 639-2]] three-letter code '''ceb''', but not a [[ISO 639-1]] two-letter code. The [[Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino]], the official regulating{{dubious|it’s damnably hard to regulate  a language; could the colleague mean “classifying”, or mebbe reporting?|date=October 2020}} body of Philippine languages, spells the name of the language as '''Sebwano'''. Cebuano — and its dialects (which include [[Boholano dialect|Boholano]]) are also sometimes referred to as '''Cebuan''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɛ|ˈ|b|uː|ən}} {{respell|seh|BOO|ən}}) — especially in [[linguistics]], where it is one of the five primary branches of the [[Visayan languages]].<ref name="Zorc">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bisayandialectso0044zorc |title=The Bisayan Dialects of the Philippines: Subgrouping and Reconstruction |last=Zorc |first=David Paul |date=1977 |publisher=Dept. of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University |isbn=0858831570 |series=Pacific Linguistics Series C - No. 44 |location=Canberra, Australia |doi=10.15144/PL-C44 |hdl=1885/146594 |url-access=registration |doi-access=free |hdl-access=free}}</ref>

==Distribution==
Cebuano is spoken in the provinces of [[Cebu]], [[Bohol]], [[Siquijor]], [[Negros Oriental]], northeastern [[Negros Occidental]], (as well as the municipality of [[Hinoba-an]] and the cities of [[Kabankalan]] and [[Sipalay]] to a great extent, alongside [[Hiligaynon language|Ilonggo]]), southern [[Masbate]], many portions of [[Leyte]], [[Biliran]], parts of [[Samar]], and large parts of [[Mindanao]], the second largest island of the Philippines.<ref name="Wolff 1972">{{harvnb|Wolff|1972|}}</ref> Furthermore, "a large portion of the urban population of [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]], [[Davao Region|Davao]], Surigao and [[Cotabato]] is Cebuano speaking".<ref name="Wolff 1972" /> Some dialects of Cebuano have different names for the language. Cebuano speakers from Cebu are mainly called "Cebuano" while those from Bohol are "Boholano". Cebuano speakers in Leyte identify their dialect as ''Kanâ'' meaning ''that'' (Leyte Cebuano or Leyteño). Speakers in [[Mindanao]] and [[Luzon]] refer to the language simply as ''Binisaya'' or ''Bisaya''.<ref name="COTFE" />

==Nomenclature== 
In common or everyday parlance, especially by those speakers from outside of the island of Cebu, Cebuano is more often referred to as ''Bisaya''. ''Bisaya'', however, may become a source of confusion as many other [[Visayan languages]] may also be referred to as ''Bisaya'' even though they are not mutually intelligible with speakers of what is referred to by linguists as Cebuano. Cebuano in this sense applies to all speakers of vernaculars mutually intelligible with the vernaculars of Cebu island, regardless of origin or location, as well as to the language they speak.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The term ''Cebuano'' (itself part of the Spanish colonial heritage, from "[[Cebu]]"+"''[[:wikt:-anus|ano]]''", a Latinate calque) has garnered some objections. For example, generations of Cebuano speakers in northern Mindanao ([[Dipolog]], [[Dapitan]], [[Misamis Occidental]] and [[Misamis Oriental]] together with coastal areas of [[Butuan]]) say that their ancestry traces back to Cebuano speakers native to their place and not from immigrants or settlers from the Visayas. Furthermore, they ethnically refer to themselves as ''Bisaya'' and not Cebuano, and their language as ''Binisaya''.<ref name="Endriga 2010">{{harvnb|Endriga|2010|p=}}</ref>

==History==
Cebuano originates from the island of Cebu.<ref name="Ceb2">{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/rosettaproject_ceb_detail-2 |title=Facts About the World's Languages: An Encyclopedia of the World's Major Languages, Past and Present |last=Wolff |first=John U. |publisher=H. W. Wilson |year=2001 |editor-last=Garry |editor-first=Jane  |location=New York |chapter=Cebuano |chapter-format=PDF |editor-last2=Galvez Rubino |editor-first2=Carl R.}}</ref> The language "has spread from its base in Cebu" to [[List of islands of Cebu|nearby islands]]<ref name="Ceb2" /> and also [[Bohol]], eastern [[Negros (island)|Negros]], western and southern parts of [[Leyte]] and most  parts of [[Mindanao]], especially the northern, southern, and eastern parts of the large island.<ref name="Wolff 1972" />

Cebuano was first documented in a list of vocabulary compiled by [[Antonio Pigafetta]], an Italian explorer who was part of and documented [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s 1521 expedition.<ref>{{cite web|title = Cebuano language, alphabet and pronunciation|url = http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cebuano.htm|website =Omniglot.com|accessdate = 22 May 2015}}</ref> Spanish missionaries started to write in the language during the early 18th century. As a result of the eventual 300-year Spanish colonial period, Cebuano contains many words of Spanish origin.

While there is evidence of a pre-Spanish writing system for the language, its use appears to have been sporadic. Spaniards recorded the [[Baybayin|Visayan script]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4e/af/c8/4eafc8e5f572d9a7bf7668bd35de9270.jpg |format=JPG |title=Alphabets Des Philippines |website=S-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com |accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref> which was called ''Kudlit-kabadlit'' by the natives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/cebu-lifestyle/706409/finding-aginid |title=Finding the "Aginid" |last=Eleanor |first=Maria |date=16 July 2011 |website=philstar.com |access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref> The colonists called the ancient Filipino script "Tagalog letters", regardless of the language for which it was used. This script died out by the 17th century as it was gradually supplanted by the Latin script.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The language was heavily influenced by the Spanish language during the period of colonialism from 1565 to 1898. With the arrival of Spanish colonists, for example, a Latin-based writing system was introduced alongside a number of Spanish loanwords.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Cebuano/ |title=Cebuano |website=www.alsintl.com |access-date=22 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407170329/http://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Cebuano/ |archive-date=7 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During the precolonial and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] period, Cebuano had only three vowel phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}. This was later expanded to five vowels with the introduction of Spanish. As a consequence,  the vowels {{angbr|o}} or {{angbr|u}}, as well as {{angbr|e}} or {{angbr|i}}, are still mostly [[allophone]]s. They can be freely switched with each other without losing their meaning ([[free variation]]); though it may sound strange to a native listener, depending on their dialect. The vowel {{angbr|a}} has no variations, though it can be pronounced subtly differently, as either {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/ʌ/}} (and very rarely as {{IPA|/ɔ/}} immediately after the consonant {{IPA|/w/}}). [[Loanword]]s, however, are usually more conservative in their orthography and pronunciation (e.g. ''dyip'', "[[jeepney]]" from English "jeep", will never be written or spoken as ''dyep'').<ref name="Endriga 2010"/><ref name="h">{{Cite book |title=Hispanisation: The Impact of Spanish on the Lexicon and Grammar of the Indigenous Languages of Austronesia and the Americas |last=Steinkrüger |first=Patrick O. |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2008 |isbn=9783110207231 |editor-last=Stolz |editor-first=Thomas |pages=203&ndash;236 |chapter=Hispanisation processes in the Philippines |editor-last2=Bakker |editor-first2=Dik |editor-last3=Palomo |editor-first3=Rosa Salas |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4kacyicU4BgC&pg=PA203}}</ref>

===Consonants===
For Cebuano consonants, all the stops are unaspirated. The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ/}} occurs in all positions, including at the beginning of a word (e.g. ''ngano'', "why"). The [[glottal stop]] {{IPAslink|ʔ}} is most commonly encountered in between two vowels, but can also appear in all positions.<ref name="Endriga 2010"/>

Like in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], glottal stops are usually not indicated in writing. When indicated, it is commonly written as a [[hyphen]] or an [[apostrophe]] if the glottal stop occurs in the middle of the word (e.g. ''to-o'' or ''to'o'', "right"). More formally, when it occurs at the end of the word, it is indicated by a [[circumflex accent]] if both a stress and a glottal stop occurs at the final vowel (e.g. ''basâ'', "wet"); or a [[grave accent]] if the glottal stop occurs at the final vowel, but the stress occurs at the penultimate syllable (e.g. ''batà'', "child").<ref name="expr">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pilipino-express.com/history-a-culture/in-other-words/1180-basics-of-filipino-pronunciation-part-2.html |title=The basics of Filipino pronunciation: Part 2 of 3 • accent marks |last=Morrow |first=Paul |date=16 March 2011 |publisher=Pilipino Express |access-date=18 July 2012}}</ref><ref name="nolasco">{{Cite book |url=http://fhl.digitalsolutions.ph/sites/default/files/grammar-notes.pdf |title=Grammar notes on the national language |last=Nolasco |first=Ricardo M.D. |work=Fhl.digitalsolutions.ph}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name="tagalog">{{Cite book |url=http://www.supadu.com/images/ckfinder/26/pdfs/PIMSLEUR/Tagalog_Phase1-Bklt.pdf |title=Tagalog Reading Booklet |publisher=Simon & Schister's Pimsleur |year=2007 |editor-last=Schoellner |editor-first=Joan |pages=5–6 |access-date=16 September 2016 |editor-last2=Heinle |editor-first2=Beverly D. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127030759/http://www.supadu.com/images/ckfinder/26/pdfs/PIMSLEUR/Tagalog_Phase1-Bklt.pdf |archive-date=27 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In certain dialects, {{IPA|/l/}} {{angbr|l}} may be interchanged with {{IPA|/w/}} {{angbr|w}} in between vowels and vice versa depending on the following conditions:<ref name="Endriga 2010"/>

*If {{angbr|l}} is in between {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|u}}/{{angbr|o}}, the vowel succeeding {{angbr|l}} is usually (but not always) dropped (e.g. ''lalum'', "deep", becomes ''lawum'' or ''lawm'').
*If {{angbr|l}} is in between {{angbr|u}}/{{angbr|o}} and {{angbr|a}}, it is the vowel that is preceding {{angbr|l}} that is instead dropped (e.g. ''bulan'', "moon", becomes ''buwan'' or ''bwan'')
*If {{angbr|l}} is in between two like vowels, the {{angbr|l}} may be dropped completely and the vowel lengthened. For example, ''dala'' ("bring"), becomes ''da'' ({{IPA|/d̪aː/}}); and ''tulod'' ("push") becomes ''tud'' ({{IPA|/t̪uːd̪/}}).<ref name="Endriga 2010"/> Except if the '''l''' is in between [[closed syllables]] or is in the beginning of the penultimate syllable; in which case, the {{angbr|l}} is dropped along with one of the vowels, and no lengthening occurs. For example, ''kalatkat'', "climb", becomes ''katkat'' ({{IPA|/ˈkatkat/}} not {{IPA|/ˈkaːtkat/}}).

A final {{angbr|l}} can also be replaced with {{angbr|w}} in certain areas in Bohol (e.g. ''tambal'', "medicine", becomes ''tambaw''). In very rare cases in Cebu, {{angbr|l}} may also be replaced with {{angbr|y}} in between the vowels {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|e}}/{{angbr|i}} (e.g. ''tingali'', "maybe", becomes ''tingayi'').<ref name="Endriga 2010"/>

In some parts of Bohol and Southern Leyte, {{IPA|/j/}} {{angbr|y}} is also often replaced with {{IPA|d͡ʒ}} {{angbr|j/dy}} when it is in the beginning of a syllable (e.g. ''kalayo'', "fire", becomes ''kalajo''). It can also happen even if the {{angbr|y}} is at the final position of the syllable and the word, but only if it is moved to the initial position by the addition of the [[affix]] ''-a''. For example, ''baboy'' ("pig") can not become ''baboj'', but ''baboya'' can become ''baboja.''<ref name="Endriga 2010" />

All of the above substitutions are considered allophonic and do not change the meaning of the word.<ref name="Endriga 2010"/>

In rarer instances, the consonant {{angbr|d}} might also be replaced with {{angbr|r}} when it is in between two vowels (e.g. Boholano ''ido'' for standard Cebuano ''iro'', "dog"), but {{angbr|d}} and {{angbr|r}} are not considered allophones,<ref name="Endriga 2010"/>  though they may have been in the past.<ref name="ver">{{Cite journal |last=Verstraelen |first=Eugene |year=1961 |title=Some further remarks about the L-feature |url=http://philippinestudies.net/ojs/index.php/ps/article/download/2806/5450 |journal=Philippine Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=72&ndash;77}}</ref>

===Stress===
Stress accent is phonemic, so that ''dapít'' (adverb) means "near to a place," while ''dāpit'' (noun) means "place."
''dū-ol'' (verb) means "come near," while ''du-ól'' (adverb) means "near" or "close by."{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Cebuano is  a member of the [[Philippine languages]]. Early trade contact resulted in a large number of older loan words from other languages being embedded in Cebuano, like [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] (e.g. ''sangka'', "fight" and ''bahandi'', "wealth", from Sanskrit ''sanka'' and ''bhānda'' respectively), and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (e.g. ''salámat'', "thanks"; ''hukom'' or ''hukm'', "judge").<ref name="kuizon">{{Cite journal |last=Kuizon |first=Jose G. |date=1964 |title=The Sanskrit Loan-Words in the Cebuano-Bisayan Language |url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/646 |journal=Asian Folklore Studies |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=111–158 |doi=10.2307/1177640 |jstor=1177640}}</ref>

It has also been influenced by thousands of words from Spanish, such as ''kurus'' [''cruz''] (cross), ''swerte'' [''suerte''] ("luck"), ''gwapa'' [''guapa''], ("beautiful"), ''merkado'' [''mercado''] ("market") and ''brilyante'' [''brillante''] ("brilliant"). It has several hundred loan words from English as well, which are altered to conform to the phonemic inventory of Cebuano: ''brislit'' (bracelet), ''hayskul'' (high school), ''syáping'' (shopping), ''bakwit'' (evacuate), and ''dráyber'' (driver). However, today, it is more common for Cebuanos to spell out those words in their original English form rather than with spelling that might conform to Cebuano standards.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==Dialects==
The de facto Standard Cebuano dialect (sometimes referred to as General Cebuano) is derived from the conservative Sialo vernacular spoken in southeastern Cebu (also known as the Sialo dialect or the Carcar-Dalaguete dialect). It first gained prominence due to its adoption by the [[Catholic Church]] as the standard for written Cebuano. It retains the intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}}.<ref name="Endriga 2010" /> In contrast, the Urban Cebuano dialect spoken by people in [[Metro Cebu]] and surrounding areas is characterized by {{IPA|/l/}} elision and heavily contracted words and phrases.<ref name="Endriga 2010"/> For example, ''waláy problema'' ("no problem") in Standard Cebuano can become ''way 'blema'' in Urban Cebuano.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Colloquialisms can also be used to determine the regional origin of the speaker. Cebuano-speaking people from [[Cagayan de Oro]] and [[Dumaguete]], for example, say ''chada'' or ''tsada''/''patsada'' (roughly translated to the English colloquialism "awesome")<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aboutcagayandeoro.com/10-fun-facts-about-cagayan-de-oro/ |title=10 Fun Facts about Cagayan de Oro |date=2016-02-05 |website=About Cagayan de Oro |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> and people from [[Davao City]] say ''atchup'' which also translated to the same English context;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ilovedavao.com/2015/01/what-do-you-mean-by-atchup-boulevard.html |title=Atchup Boulevard Explained |website=www.ilovedavao.com |access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> meanwhile Cebuanos from Cebu on the other hand say ''nindot'' or, sometimes, ''aníndot''. However, this word is also commonly used in the same context in other Cebuano-speaking regions, in effect making this word not only limited in use to Cebu.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

There is no standardized orthography for Cebuano, but spelling in print usually follow the pronunciation of Standard Cebuano, regardless of how it is actually spoken by the speaker. For example, ''baláy'' ("house") is pronounced {{IPA|/baˈl̪aɪ/}} in Standard Cebuano and is thus spelled "baláy", even in Urban Cebuano where it is actually pronounced {{IPA|/ˈbaɪ/}}.<ref name="Endriga 2010"/>

Cebuano is spoken natively over a large area of the Philippines and thus has numerous regional dialects. It can vary significantly in terms of [[lexicon]] and phonology depending on where it is spoken.<ref name="Endriga 2010"/> Increasing usage of spoken English (being the primary language of commerce and education in the Philippines) has also led to the introduction of new pronunciations and spellings of old Cebuano words. [[Code-switching]] forms of English and Bisaya ([[Bislish]]) are also common among the educated younger generations.<ref name="zuck">{{Cite book |title=Burning Issues in Afro-Asiatic Linguistics |last=Nissan |first=Ephraim |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=9781443864626 |editor-last=Zuckermann |editor-first=Ghil‘ad |page=299 |chapter=Asia at Both Ends: An Introduction to Etymythology, with a Response to Chapter Nine |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdcxBwAAQBAJ&q=BISLISH&pg=PA299}}</ref><ref name="melerk">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W5cXvmMg4_cC&q=BISLISH&pg=PA209 |title=Interactions Across Englishes: Linguistic Choices in Local and International Contact Situations |last=Meierkord |first=Christiane |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2012 |isbn=9780521192286 |location=Cambridge |page=209}}</ref>

===Boholano Cebuano ===
The [[Boholano dialect]] of [[Bohol]] shares many similarities with the southern form of the standard Cebuano dialect. It is also spoken in some parts of [[Siquijor]]. Boholano, especially as spoken in central Bohol, can be distinguished from other Cebuano variants by a few [[phonetic change]]s:
*The semivowel ''y'' is pronounced {{IPA|[dʒ]}}: ''iya'' is pronounced {{IPA|[iˈdʒa]}};
*''Ako'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[aˈho]}};
*Intervocalic ''l'' is occasionally pronounced as {{IPA|[w]}} when following ''u'' or ''o'': ''kulang'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[ˈkuwaŋ]}} (the same as [[Metro Cebu]] dialect).

=== Leyteño Cebuano ===

====Southern Kana====
Southern Kana is a dialect of both southern [[Leyte]] and [[Southern Leyte]] provinces; it is closest to the Mindanao Cebuano dialect at the southern area and northern Cebu dialect at the northern boundaries. Both North and South Kana are subgroups of [[Leyteño dialect]]. Both of these dialects are spoken in western and central Leyte and in the southern province, but the Boholano is more concentrated in [[Maasin City]].

==== Northern Kana ====
North Kana (found in the northern part of [[Leyte]]), is closest to the variety of the language spoken in northern part of Leyte, and shows significant influence from Waray-Waray, quite notably in its pace which speakers from Cebu find very fast, and its more mellow tone (compared to the urban Cebu City dialect, which Kana speakers find "rough"). A distinguishing feature of this dialect is the reduction of {{IPA|/A/}} prominent, but an often unnoticed feature of this dialect is the labialisation of {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} into {{IPA|/m/}}, when these phonemes come before {{IPA|/p/}} {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}, velarisation of {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} into {{IPA|/ŋ/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, and the dentalisation of {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} into {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} and sometimes, before vowels and other consonants as well.

=== Mindanao Cebuano ===
This is the variety of Cebuano spoken throughout most of [[Mindanao]] and it is the standard dialect of Cebuano in [[Northern Mindanao]].

Local historical sources found in Cagayan de Oro indicates the early presence of Cebuano Visayans in the Misamis-Agusan coastal areas and their contacts with the Lumads and peoples of the Rajahnate of Butuan. Lumads refer to these Visayan groups as "Dumagat" ("people of the sea") as they came in the area seaborne. It became the lingua franca of precolonial Visayan settlers and native Lumads of the area, and particularly of the ancient Rajahnate of Butuan where [[Butuanon language|Butuanon]], a Southern Visayan language, was also spoken. Cebuano influence in Lumad languages around the highlands of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon was furthered with the influx of Cebuano Visayan laborers and conscripts of the Spaniards from Cebuano areas of Visayas (particularly from Bohol) during the colonial period around the present-day region of Northern Mindanao. It has spread west towards the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], east towards [[Caraga]], and south towards [[Bukidnon]], [[Cotabato]] and the [[Davao Region]] in the final years of Spanish colonial rule.

Similar to the Sialo dialect of southeastern Cebu, it is distinctive in retaining /l/ sounds, long since considered archaic in Urban Cebuano. For example: ''bulan'' instead of ''buwan'' ("moon" or "month"), ''dalunggan'' instead of ''dunggan'' (ear), and ''halang'' instead of ''hang'' ("spicy").

Due to the influx of migrants (mostly from Western Visayas and Leyte) during the promotion of settlement in the highlands of Central Mindanao in the 1930s, vocabulary from other Visayan languages (predominantly [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Waray-Waray language|Waray-Waray]]) have also been incorporated into Mindanao Cebuano. For example, the Hiligaynon ''sábat'' ("reply") is commonly used alongside Cebuano ''tubag'', ''bulig'' alongside ''tábang'' ("help"), and Waray ''lutô'' alongside ''kan-on'' ("cooked rice"). Though, these influences are only limited to the speakers along the port area and Hiligaynon-speaking communities.

==== Davaoeño Cebuano ====
{{Distinguish|Chavacano language#Castellano Abakay (Chavacano Davaoeño){{!}}Chavacano language: Castellano Abakay (Chabacano de Davao)}}

A branch of Mindanao Cebuano in [[Davao City|Davao]] is also known as Davaoeño (not to be confused with the Davao variant of [[Chavacano]] which is called "Castellano Abakay"). Like the Cebuano-speakers of Luzon (Luzon Cebuano dialect), it contains some [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] vocabulary to a greater extent. Its grammar is somewhat in between the original Cebuano language and the Luzon Cebuano dialect. However, speakers from Davao City nowadays exhibits stronger Tagalog influence in their speech by substituting most Cebuano words with Tagalog ones. One characteristic is the practice of saying ''atà'', derived from Tagalog ''yatà'' to denote uncertainty of a speaker's any aforementioned statements. For instance, ''"To-a man <u>atà</u> sa baláy si Manuel"'' instead of ''"To-a man <u>tingáli</u> sa baláy si Manuel"''. However, the word ''atà'' exists in Cebuano though it means " squid ink" (<u>atà sa nukos</u>).

Other examples include: ''<u>Nibabâ</u> ko sa dyip sa kanto, <u>tapos</u> miulî ko sa among baláy'' ("I got off the [[jeepney]] at the street corner, and then I went home") instead of ''<u>Nináug</u> ko sa dyip sa kanto, <u>dayon</u> miulî ko sa among baláy''. The words ''babâ'' and ''naug'' mean "to disembark" or "to go down", while ''tapos'' and ''dayon'' mean "then"; the former is Tagalog, and the latter Cebuano. It also sometimes add some [[Mansakan languages|Bagobo and Mansakan]] vocabulary, like: ''<u>Madayaw</u> nga adlaw, amigo, kamusta ka?'' ("<u>Good day</u>, friend, how are you?", literally "Good morning/afternoon") rather than ''"<u>Maayo</u> nga adlaw, amigo, kamusta ka?"'' The words ''madayaw'' and ''maayo'' mean "good"; the former is Bagobo, and the latter Cebuano.

===Negrense Cebuano===
The Cebuano dialect in [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]] is somewhat similar to the Standard Cebuano (spoken by the majority of the provincial areas of Cebu), with distinct [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] influences. It is distinctive in retaining {{IPA|/l/}} sounds and longer word forms as well. It is the primary dialectal language of the entire province of [[Negros Oriental]] and northeastern parts of [[Negros Occidental]] (while the majority of the latter province and its bordered areas speaks Hiligaynon/Ilonggo), as well as some parts of [[Siquijor]]. Examples of Negrense Cebuano's distinction from other Cebuano dialects is the usage of the word ''maot'' instead of ''batî'' ("ugly"), ''alálay'', ''kalálag'' instead of ''kalag-kalag'' (Halloween), ''kabaló/kahíbaló'' and ''kaágo/kaántigo'' instead of ''kabawó/kahíbawó'' ("know").

=== Other dialects ===

==== Luzon Cebuano ====
There is no specific [[Luzon]] dialect, as speakers of Cebuano in Luzon come from many different regions in Central Visayas and Mindanao. Cebuano-speaking people from Luzon in Visayas can be easily recognized primarily by their vocabulary which incorporates [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] words. Their accents and some aspects of grammar can also sometimes exhibit [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] influence. The dialect is sometimes colloquially known as "[[Bisalog]]" (a [[portmanteau]] of Tagalog and Binisaya).

==== ''Saksak Sinagol'' ====
The term [[wikt:saksak sinagol|saksak sinagol]] in context means "a collection of miscellaneous things" and literally "inserted mixture", thus those other few Cebuano-influenced regions that have a variety of regional languages uses this term to refer to their dialect with considerable incorporated Cebuano words. Example of these regions are places likes those in [[Masbate]].

==Examples==
===Numbers===
Cebuano uses two numeral systems:
<br/>The '''native system''' (currently) is mostly used in counting the number of things, animate and inanimate, e.g. the number of horses, houses.
<br/>The '''spanish-derived''' system, on the other hand, is exclusively applied in monetary terminology and is also commonly used in counting from 11 and above.
