At the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]], American singer [[Lady Gaga]] wore an infamous dress made of raw [[beef]], which was commonly referred to by the media as the '''meat dress'''.<ref name="mtvdesigner"/><ref name="guardianangers"/><ref name="designerhuffington"/> Designed by [[Franc Fernandez]] and styled by [[Nicola Formichetti]], the dress was condemned by animal rights groups, and named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as the top fashion statement of 2010.

The press speculated on the originality of the meat dress idea, with comparisons made to similar images found in contemporary art and popular culture. As with her other dresses, it was archived, but went on display in 2011 at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] after being preserved by [[taxidermist]]s as a type of [[jerky]]. Gaga explained following the awards ceremony that the dress was a statement about one's need to fight for what one believes in, and highlighted her distaste for the US military's [[Don't ask, don't tell|don't-ask-don't-tell]] policy.

==Background==
Gaga was the most nominated artist at 2010's Video Music Awards with a record thirteen nominations, including two nods for [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] (the first female artist to achieve this feat).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1644956/lady-gaga-eminem-top-vma-nominations/|title=Lady Gaga, Eminem Top VMA Nominations|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=August 3, 2010|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=May 20, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505132012/http://www.mtv.com/news/1644956/lady-gaga-eminem-top-vma-nominations/|archivedate=May 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She arrived in an [[Alexander McQueen]] dress and changed into a [[Giorgio Armani]] number before donning her third and final outfit of the evening: a dress, hat, boots, and purse made of raw meat. Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for "[[Bad Romance]]"; as she accepted the award from presenter [[Cher]], she joked, "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to hold my meat purse."<ref name="ganz">{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/meet-the-mystery-meat-dress-lady-gaga-explains-rare-vmas-outfit.html|title=Meet the Mystery Meat Dress: Lady Gaga Explains Rare VMAs Outfit|last=Ganz|first=Caryn|date=September 12, 2010|archivedate=December 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225012039/http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/meet-the-mystery-meat-dress-lady-gaga-explains-rare-vmas-outfit.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Fernandez said of his design, "I knew the dress would be one of other amazing pieces Gaga wore that night. It's very well made and looked great on her, on and off camera. We didn't get a chance to have a fitting. The only time she had it on was for the VMAs. Only when I saw it in the monitor did I know it would be big."<ref name=designerhuffington />

Fernandez reporting Gaga's opinion in an interview said that Gaga herself said it smelled good, because it smelled like meat.<ref name=mtvdesigner /> The designer talked of what was to happen to the dress after the awards show, "The dress will be put in an archive with all of her dresses. The Gaga Archives, I suppose. It won't last, that's the beauty of it. When it is brought out again, hopefully it will be in a retrospective, and it will be a different dress, which is the best thing. I like the idea of it changing and evolving into something else".<ref name=mtvdesigner /> He later explained that the dress would be preserved and made into a type of [[jerky (food)|jerky]] before being archived.<ref name=jerky>{{cite web|last=Gornstein|first=Leslie|title=Did anyone ever eat Lady Gaga's meat dress?|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39311642/ns/today-entertainment/t/did-anyone-ever-eat-lady-gagas-meat-dress/|accessdate=May 14, 2011|publisher=[[E!]]|date=September 22, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325022326/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39311642/ns/today-entertainment/t/did-anyone-ever-eat-lady-gagas-meat-dress|archivedate=March 25, 2012}}</ref>

The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] paid $6,000 to taxidermist Sergio Vigilato to preserve the dress. It had been frozen following the two television appearances, although Vigilato discovered signs of decomposition on the dress which had occurred prior to it being frozen, and noted it was emitting an odor once it was defrosted. It was treated with bleach, [[formaldehyde]] and detergent to kill any bacteria, and was reconditioned by being dyed dark red once it was preserved so to give it the same appearance as when first worn. However, after the preservation there were several pieces of beef left over and not included in the reworked dress.<ref name=preserves>{{cite web|last=Pool |first=Bob |title=Taxidermist preserves Lady Gaga's meat dress for posterity |url=https://vancouversun.com/travel/Taxidermist+preserves+Lady+Gaga+meat+dress+posterity/5145206/story.html |accessdate=July 31, 2011 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726020721/http://www.vancouversun.com/travel/Taxidermist%2Bpreserves%2BLady%2BGaga%2Bmeat%2Bdress%2Bposterity/5145206/story.html |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Reception==
Following the VMAs, media outlets attempted to analyse the meaning of the dress with suggestions by [[BBC News]] ranging from [[anti-fashion]], to [[feminism]], aging and decay, and society's attitude towards meat. Chef [[Fergus Henderson]] explained this meat attitude as "People often don't want meat to look like meat. They want it to be neatly wrapped in plastic from a supermarket."<ref name=interpret>{{cite news|last=Winterman|first=Denise|last2=Kelly|first2=Jon|title=Five interpretations of Lady Gaga's meat dress|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11297832|accessdate=May 14, 2011|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=September 14, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915042148/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11297832|archivedate=September 15, 2010|df=mdy-all|work=BBC News}}</ref> [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said "wearing a dress made from cuts of dead cows is offensive enough to bring comment, but someone should whisper in her ear that more people are upset by butchery than are impressed by it."<ref name=meattelegraph>{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Laura|title=Lady Gaga's meat dress divides opinion|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8001267/Lady-Gagas-meat-dress-divides-opinion.html|accessdate=May 14, 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=September 14, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914221630/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8001267/Lady-Gagas-meat-dress-divides-opinion.html|archivedate=September 14, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=peta>{{cite web|last=Newkirk|first=Ingrid E.|title=Lady Gaga's Meat Dress|url=http://www.peta.org/blog/lady-gagas-meat-dress/|date=September 13, 2010|publisher=[[PETA]]|accessdate=September 13, 2010|url-status=live|archivedate=July 24, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724024859/http://www.peta.org/blog/lady-gagas-meat-dress/}}</ref> The Vegetarian Society also condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said "No matter how beautifully it is presented, flesh from a tortured animal is flesh from a tortured animal.

Another controversy surrounding the dress was the question of its originality. Brooks Barnes of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the dress was "derived" from ''Incarnation'', a painting of a white-haired girl wearing a meat dress by artist [[Mark Ryden]].<ref
