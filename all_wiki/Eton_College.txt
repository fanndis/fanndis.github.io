Eton College was founded by King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] as a [[charity school]] to provide free education to 70 poor boys who would then go on to [[King's College, Cambridge]], founded by the same King in 1441. Henry took [[Winchester College]] as his model, visiting on many occasions, borrowing its statutes and removing its headmaster and some of the scholars to start his new school.

When Henry VI founded the school, he granted it a large number of endowments, including much valuable land. The group of [[feoffee]]s appointed by the king to receive forfeited lands of the [[Alien priory|Alien Priories]] for the endowment of Eton were as follows:<ref>Watts, John, ''Henry VI and the Politics of Kingship'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qTP4CF_boeoC&pg=PA169#v=twopage&q&f=false pp. 169–70], quoting Calendar of [[Patent Rolls]] 1436–41, pp. 454, 471.</ref>

It was intended to have formidable buildings (Henry intended the [[nave]] of the [[Eton College Chapel|College Chapel]] to be the longest in Europe) and several religious [[relic]]s, supposedly including a part of the [[True Cross]] and the [[Crown of Thorns]].<ref name=lrb>{{cite news|last=Hope|first=Charles|title=At Eton|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n05/charles-hope/at-eton|accessdate=28 February 2013 |newspaper=London Review of Books|date=7 March 2013}}</ref> He persuaded the then [[Pope]], [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene IV]], to grant him a privilege unparalleled anywhere in England: the right to grant [[indulgence]]s to [[penitent]]s on the [[Feast of the Assumption]]. The college also came into possession of one of England's [[English Apocalypse manuscripts|Apocalypse manuscripts]].

However, when Henry was deposed by [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]] in 1461, the new King annulled all grants to the school and removed most of its assets and treasures to [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], on the other side of the [[River Thames]]. Legend has it that Edward's mistress, [[Jane Shore]], intervened on the school's behalf. She was able to save a good part of the school,<ref>Nevill. p.5.</ref> although the royal bequest and the number of staff were much reduced.

Construction of the chapel, originally intended to be slightly over twice as long,<ref>Nevill, p.5.</ref> with 18, or possibly 17, bays (there are eight today) was stopped when Henry VI was deposed. Only the [[choir (architecture)|Quire]] of the intended building was completed. Eton's first Headmaster, [[William Waynflete]], founder of Magdalen College, Oxford and previously Head Master of [[Winchester College]],<ref>Nevill, p.4.</ref> built the ante-chapel that completed the chapel. The important wall paintings in the chapel and the brick north range of the present School Yard also date from the 1480s; the lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, were built between 1441 and 1460.<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, Buildings of England – Buckinghamshire</ref>

As the school suffered reduced income while still under construction, the completion and further development of the school has since depended to some extent on wealthy benefactors. Building resumed when [[Roger Lupton]] was [[Provost (education)|Provost]], around 1517. His name is borne by the big [[gatehouse]] in the west range of the cloisters, fronting School Yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school. This range includes the important interiors of the Parlour, Election Hall, and Election Chamber, where most of the 18th century "leaving portraits" are kept.

"After Lupton's time, nothing important was built until about 1670, when Provost Allestree gave a range to close the west side of School Yard between Lower School and Chapel".<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, op. cit. p.119.</ref> This was remodelled later and completed in 1694 by Matthew Bankes, Master Carpenter of the Royal Works. The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister, 1725–29, by Thomas Rowland. It has a very important collection of books and manuscripts.

=== 19th century onwards ===
In the 19th century, the architect [[John Shaw Jr]] (1803–1870) became surveyor to Eton. He designed New Buildings (1844–46),<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, op. cit.</ref> Provost [[Francis Hodgson]]'s addition to providing better accommodation for collegers, who until then had mostly lived in Long Chamber, a long first-floor room where conditions were inhumane.<ref>Extracts from c. 20 of ''A History of Eton College'' by Maxwell Lyte:<br />These rooms contained little besides wooden bedsteads and bureaus. Chairs and tables [were] for the privileged few, and the wind whistled through the gaping casements. Candlesticks were made by folding the cover of a school-book and cutting a hole to receive the candle. A servant was supposed to sweep the rooms, make beds and light fires, but this was all. The lower boys had to fetch water from the pump for [the seniors]. They themselves had neither washstands nor basins...New boys were tossed in blankets until about 1832. In 1834, "the inmates of a workhouse are better fed than the scholars of Eton ... Boys who could not pay for a private room [in the town] are said to have undergone privations that would be thought inhuman if inflicted on a galley-slave."</ref>

Following complaints about the finances, buildings and management of Eton, the [[Clarendon Commission]] was set up in 1861 as a [[royal commission]] to investigate the state of nine schools in England, including Eton.<ref>J. Stuart Maclure, ''Educational Documents: England and Wales, 1816 to present day'' (Methuen Young Books, 1973, {{ISBN|978-0-416-78290-5}}), p.83</ref>
Questioned by the commission in 1862, headmaster [[Edward Balston]] came under attack for his view that in the classroom little time could be spared for subjects other than [[classical studies]].<ref>''Report of Her Majesty's Commissioners appointed to inquire into the Revenues and Management of certain Colleges and Schools, and the Studies pursued and Instruction given therein; with an Appendix and Evidence'', vol. III (evidence) (Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1864), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IIRLAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false] pp.114–116</ref>

[[File:"View of classroom at Eton College, England, showing plainess of the furniture and names carved thereon by the... - NARA - 298013.tif|thumb|left|An Eton College classroom in the 19th century]]
The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] is often incorrectly quoted as saying that "The [[Battle of Waterloo]] was won on the playing-fields of Eton."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762878,00.html |title=Ploughing Fields of Eton |work=Time |location=New York |date=27 November 1939}}</ref> Wellington was at Eton from 1781 to 1784 and was to send his sons there. According to Nevill (citing the historian [[Edward Shepherd Creasy|Sir Edward Creasy]]), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, "There grows the stuff that won Waterloo",<ref>Nevill, p.125.</ref> a remark Nevill construes as a reference to "the manly character induced by games and sport" among English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically. In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's ''C'est ici qu'a été gagné la bataille de Waterloo'' ("It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won").

As with other public schools,<ref>The Boy's Own Paper Nov 1915 to September 1919</ref> a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiarise privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas.<ref>Arthur C. Benson, Hugh, Memoirs of a Brother, chapter eight</ref> The project of establishing an "Eton Mission" in the crowded district of [[Hackney Wick]] in east London was started at the beginning of 1880, and it lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project (at [[Dorney]]) would be more realistic. However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by [[G. F. Bodley]] was erected; many Etonians visited and stimulated among other things the [[Eton Manor Boys' Club]], a notable rowing club which has survived the Mission itself, and the [[59 Club]] for motorcyclists.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13350, England, Rudermannschaft.jpg|thumb|right|Pupils at Eton College dressed as members of various rowing crews taking part in the "Procession of Boats" on the River Thames during the "Fourth of June" celebrations 1932]]
The very large and ornate School Hall and School Library (by L. K. Hall) were erected in 1906–08 across the road from Upper School as the school's memorial to the Etonians who had died in the [[Boer War]]. Many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead Etonians of the [[World War I|Great War]]. A bomb destroyed part of Upper School in [[World War II]] and blew out many windows in the chapel. The college commissioned replacements by [[Evie Hone]] (1949–52) and by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] and [[Patrick Reyntiens]] (1959 onward).

Among headmasters of the 20th century were [[Cyril Alington]], [[Robert Birley]] and [[Anthony Chenevix-Trench]]. [[M. R. James]] was a provost.

In 1959, the college constructed a [[nuclear bunker]] to house the college's provost and fellows. The facility is now used for storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/e/eton_college/index.html |title=Eton College Site Visit Report |publisher=Subbrit.org.uk |date=28 October 2000 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>

In 1969 Dillibe Onyeama became the first black person to obtain his school-leaving certificate from Eton. Three years later Onyeama was banned from visiting Eton after he published a book which described the racism that he experienced during his time at the school.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-06-23|title=The racist questions I was asked at Eton|language=en-GB|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53062502|access-date=2020-06-23}}</ref> [[Simon Henderson (headmaster)|Simon Henderson]], current headmaster of Eton, apologised to Onyeama for the treatment he endured during his time at the school, although Onyeama did not think the apology was necessary.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/world-africa-53139325 |publisher=BBC News |title=Eton apologises to Nigerian ex-student Onyeama for racism |date=22 June 2020}}</ref>

In 2005, the school was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools found to have breached the [[Competition Act 1998]] (see [[Eton College controversies]]).

In 2011, plans to attack Eton were found on the body of a senior [[al-Qaeda]] leader shot dead in [[Somalia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/8578710/Eton-and-The-Ritz-on-al-Qaeda-hit-list.html |title=Eton and The Ritz on al-Qaeda hit list |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=16 June 2011 |author=Farmer, Ben |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>

== Coat of arms ==
[[File:Eton College Old Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb|Arms of Eton College: ''Sable, three lily-flowers argent on a chief per pale azure and gules in the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] a fleur-de-lys in the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] a lion passant guardant or'']]
The [[coat of arms]] of Eton College was granted in 1449 by the founder King Henry VI, as recorded as follows on the original charter, attested by the [[Great Seal of England]] and preserved in the College archives:<ref name="etoncollege.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.etoncollege.com/ArmsMotto.aspx|title=The Arms and Motto |publisher=Eton College |access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref>
:''On a field sable three lily-flowers argent, intending that Our newly-founded College, lasting for ages to come, whose perpetuity We wish to be signified by the stability of the sable colour, shall bring forth the brightest flowers redolent of every kind of knowledge; to which also, that We may impart something of royal nobility which may declare the work truly royal and illustrious, We have resolved that that portion of the [[Royal arms of England|arms which by royal right belong to Us]] in the Kingdoms of France and England be placed on the chief of the shield, per pale azure with a [[Fleur-de-lys|flower of the French]], and gules with a [[Armorial of Plantagenet|leopard passant or]]''.

Thus the [[blazon]] is: ''Sable, three lily-flowers argent on a chief per pale azure and gules in the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] a fleur-de-lys in the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] a lion passant guardant or''. Although the charter specifies that the lily-flowers relate to the founder's hope for a flourishing of knowledge, that flower is also a symbol for the [[Virgin Mary]], in whose honour the college was founded, with the number of three having significance to the [[Blessed Trinity]]. The motto of the college is ''Floreat Etona'' ("may Eton flourish"). The grant of arms to King's College, Cambridge, is worded identically, but with roses instead of lily-flowers.<ref name="etoncollege.com" />

== Overview ==
[[File:. Widok z ulicy - Eton College - panoramio (5).jpg|thumb|Eton College]]
The school is headed by a [[List of Provosts of Eton College|provost]] and fellows (board of governors) who appoint the headmaster. It contains 25 boys' [[house system|houses]], each headed by a [[housemaster]], selected from the more senior members of the teaching staff, which numbers some 155.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.etoncollege.com/TheEtonCurriculum-TheStaff.aspx|title=College staff|publisher=Eton College|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> Almost all of the school's pupils go on to universities, about a third of them to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4634031.stm |title=What is it like at Eton College? |publisher=BBC News |date=4 July 2005 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>

The headmaster is a member of the [[Headmasters Conference|Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] and the school is a member of the [[Eton Group]] of [[independent school (UK)|independent schools]] in the United Kingdom.

Eton has a long list of distinguished former pupils. In 2019, [[Boris Johnson]] became the 20th [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by education|British prime minister]] to have attended the school,<ref>{{cite news|title=As Boris Johnson – Another Prime Minister Who Went to Eton – Enters Office, its time to end private school privilege |newspaper=The Huffington Post |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/eton-private-school-boris-johnson_uk_5d36d153e4b020cd99490ca6 |date=23 July 2019 |accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> and the fifth since the end of the Second World War<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17788812.boris-johnson-will-fifth-eton-educated-pm-since-1945/ |newspaper=The Herald Scotland |title=Boris Johnson will be the fifth Eton educated PM since 1945 |date=23 July 2019 |accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> Previous Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] was the 19th British prime minister to have attended the school,<ref name="bbcnews">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8622933.stm |title=Why has Eton produced so many prime ministers? |last=Moss |first=Paul |date=12 May 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=10 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=MacDonald |first=Alistair |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703950804575242431958967118 |title=After Labour, Posh is Back in Britain |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=14 May 2010}}</ref> and recommended that Eton set up a school in the state sector to help drive up standards.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14859876 |title=David Cameron urges Eton to set up state school |publisher=BBC News |date=9 September 2011 |accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref>

=== Fame ===
Eton has been described as the most famous public school in the world,<ref>{{cite news |last=Doward |first=Jamie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/26/monarchy.publicschools |title=Eton waits for verdict in Harry 'cheating' case |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=26 June 2005}}</ref> and has been referred to as "the chief nurse of England's statesmen".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/162402.stm |title=Eton—the establishment's choice |publisher=BBC News |date=2 September 1998 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>

Eton has educated generations of British and foreign aristocracy, and for the first time, members of the [[British royal family]] in direct line of succession: [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] and his brother [[Prince Harry]], in contrast to the royal tradition of male education at either naval college or [[Gordonstoun]], or by tutors.

The ''[[Good Schools Guide]]'' called the school "the number one boys' public school", adding that "The teaching and facilities are second to none."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/school/eton-college.html |title=Eton College |publisher=The Good Schools Guide |accessdate=3 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505211237/http://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/school/eton-college.html |archivedate=5 May 2011}}</ref> The school is a member of the [[G20 Schools]] Group.

Eton today is a larger school than it has been for much of its history. In 1678, there were 207 boys. In the late 18th century, there were about 300, while today, the total has risen to over 1,300.<ref>Nevill, pp.15, 23.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/registration.aspx|title=Registration|publisher=Eton College|accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>

=== Financial support ===
About 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tatler.com/guides/schools-guide/2012/public/eton-college |title=Tatler Schools Guide 2012 – Eton College |work=The Tatler |year=2012}}</ref> The recent Head Master, [[Tony Little (headmaster)|Tony Little]], said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received "significant" financial help from the school.<ref name=Telegraph2 /> In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge. Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils receiving financial assistance would continue to increase.<ref name=Telegraph1 />

=== Changes to the school ===
Registration at birth, corporal punishment, and [[fagging]] have been consigned to the past.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Academic standards were raised, and by the mid-1990s, Eton ranked among Britain's top three schools in getting its pupils into [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-09-03/news/9509030253_1_eton-college-etonians-prince-william/2 |title=Young Prince William Takes 1st Step Toward Becoming 'Old Etonian' |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=3 September 1995 |accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>

The proportion of boys at the school who were sons of Old Etonians fell dramatically, from 60% in 1960 to 20% in 2016. This has been attributed to a number of factors, including the dissolution of the house lists, which allowed Old Etonians to register their sons at birth, in 1990, harder entrance examinations as the emphasis on academic attainment increased, a sharp rise in school fees increasingly beyond the means of many UK families, and increased applications from international, often very wealthy, families.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=de Bellaigue, Christopher|authorlink=Christopher de Bellaigue|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/features/eton-and-the-making-of-a-modern-elite|title=Eton and the making of a modern elite|magazine=[[1843 Magazine]]|date=August–September 2016|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>

== School terms ==
<!--[[Half (Eton)]] redirects here-->
There are three academic terms<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/Michaelmas.aspx |title=The Michaelmas Half |publisher=Eton College |year=2008}}</ref> (known as halves)<ref>McConnell, p.30</ref> in the year:
* The ''[[Michaelmas]] Half'', from early September to mid-December. New boys are now admitted only at the start of the Michaelmas Half, unless in exceptional circumstances.
* The ''[[Lent]] Half'', from mid-January to late March.
* The ''Summer Half'', from late April to late June or early July.

They are called halves because the school year was once split into two halves, between which the boys went home.

== Boys' houses ==

=== King's Scholars ===
{{Main|King's Scholar}}
One boarding house, ''College'', is reserved for 70 King's Scholars, who attend Eton on scholarships provided by the original foundation and awarded by examination each year; King's Scholars pay up to 90 per cent of full fees, depending on their means. Of the other pupils, up to a third receive some kind of bursary or scholarship. The name 'King's Scholars' refers to the foundation of the school by King Henry VI in 1440. The original school consisted of the 70 Scholars (together with some Commensals) and the Scholars were educated and boarded at the foundation's expense.

King's Scholars are entitled to use the letters 'KS' after their name and they can be identified by a black gown worn over the top of their [[tailcoat]]s, giving them the nickname 'tugs' (Latin: ''togati'', wearers of gowns); and occasionally by a [[surplice]] in Chapel. The house is looked after by the [[Master in College]]. Having succeeded in the examination, they include many of the most academically gifted boys in the school.

=== Oppidans ===
As the school grew, more students were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in boarding-houses within the town of Eton, outside the college's original buildings. These students became known as Oppidans, from the [[Latin]] word ''[[oppidum]]'', meaning "town".<ref>McConnell, pp.19–20</ref> The houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the 18th and 19th centuries the housemasters started to rely more for administrative purposes on a senior female member of staff, known as a "dame", who became responsible for the physical welfare of the boys. (Some houses had previously been run by dames without a housemaster.) Each house typically contains about 50 boys. Although classes are organised on a school basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their house.

Not all boys who pass the college election examination choose to become King's Scholars, which involves living in "College" with its own ancient traditions, wearing a gown, and therefore a degree of separation from the other boys. If they choose instead to belong to one of the 24 Oppidan houses, they are known as [[Oppidan Scholar]]s.<ref>McConnell, p.177</ref> [[Oppidan Scholar|Oppidan scholarships]] may also be awarded for consistently performing with distinction in school and external examinations. To gain an Oppidan Scholarship, a boy must have either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his career. Within the school, an Oppidan Scholar is entitled to use the [[post-nominal letters]] ''OS''.

Each Oppidan house is usually referred to by the initials (forenames and surname) of its current housemaster, a senior teacher ("beak"), or more formally by his surname alone, not by the name of the building in which it is situated. Houses occasionally swap buildings according to the seniority of the housemaster and the physical desirability of the building. The names of buildings occupied by houses are used for few purposes other than a correspondence address. They are: Godolphin House, Jourdelay's (both built as such c. 1720),<ref name=autogenerated1>Pevsner op. cit.</ref> Hawtrey House, [[Richard Durnford|Durnford]] House (the first two built as such by the Provost and Fellows, 1845,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> when the school was increasing in numbers and needed more centralised control), The Hopgarden, South Lawn, Waynflete, Evans's, Keate House, Warre House, Villiers House, Common Lane House, Penn House, Walpole House, Cotton Hall, Wotton House, Holland House, Mustians, Angelo's, Manor House, Farrer House, Baldwin's Bec, The Timbralls, and Westbury.

=== House structure ===
[[File:MK17840 Eton College.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Front of Eton College]]
In addition to the house master, each house has a house captain and a house captain of games. Some houses have more than one. House prefects were once elected from the oldest year, but this no longer happens. The old term, "Library", survives in the name of the room set aside for the oldest year's use, where boys have their own kitchen. Similarly, boys in their penultimate year have a room known as "Debate".

There are entire house gatherings every evening, usually around 8:05–8:30&nbsp;p.m. These are known as "Prayers", due to their original nature. The house master and boys have an opportunity to make announcements, and sometimes the boys provide light entertainment.

For much of Eton's history, junior boys had to act as "fags", or servants, to older boys. Their duties included cleaning, cooking, and running errands. A Library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice, "Boy, Up!" or "Boy, Queue!", and all first-year boys had to come running. The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as [[fagging]], were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s. Captains of house and games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from the school office.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

There are many inter-house competitions, mostly in sports.

== Head Masters: 1442–present ==
{{Main|List of Head Masters of Eton College}}

== Uniform ==
[[File:Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester 4909925573 1cfc8ea5c0 o.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] in 1914 dress of a junior Eton pupil, wearing a top hat, neck-tie and "bum-freezer", none of which are now worn]]
The School is known for its traditions, including a uniform of black tailcoat (or [[morning coat]]) and black [[waistcoat]], a starched [[false-collar|stiff collar]] and black pinstriped trousers. Most pupils wear a white "[[Necktie|tie]]" which is a narrow strip of cloth folded over the joint of the collar to hide the collar stud, but some senior boys are entitled to wear a white bow tie and winged collar ("Stick-Ups"). There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority, see [[#Prefects|School Prefects]] and [[#King's Scholars|King's Scholars]] sections.

The long-standing belief that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1820<ref>Nevill, p.33.</ref> is unfounded. In 1862 headmaster [[Edward Balston]], in an interview with the [[Clarendon Commission]], noted little in the way of uniform.

<blockquote>Lord Clarendon: One more question, which bears in some degree upon other schools, namely with regard to the dress. The boys do not wear any particular dress at Eton?
Edward Balston: No, with the exception that they are obliged to wear a white neckcloth.

Lord Clarendon: Is the colour of their clothes much restricted?

Edward Balston: We would not let them wear for instance a yellow coat or any other colour very much out of the way.

Lord Clarendon: If they do not adopt anything very extravagant either with respect to colour or cut you allow them to follow their own taste with respect to the choice of their clothes?

Edward Balston: Yes.

Lord Lyttelton: They must wear the common round hat?
Edward Balston: Yes.<ref>(1864).''Report of Her Majesty’s Commissioners Appointed to Inquire into the Revenues and Management of Certain Colleges and Schools and the Studies Pursued and Instruction Given Therein; with an Appendix and Evidence, Vol. III. Evidence Part 1.'' London: Printed by George Edward Eyre and William Spottiswoode. p.116.</ref></blockquote>

[[File:17th Duke of Alba at Eton.jpg|thumb|170px|The [[Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba|17th Duke of Alba]] in late 1800s Eton dress]]

The uniform worn today was gradually adopted and standardised towards the end of the nineteenth century.<ref>McConnell, J.D.R (1967). ''Eton – How it Works''. London: Faber and Faber. p.162.</ref> Until 1967,  boys under the height of 5'4" (1.63 m) wore a cropped jacket (known as an Eton jacket, [[mess jacket]], or "bum-freezer") instead of a tailcoat.<ref>[http://www.joyceimages.com/media/ji/thumbnails/small_Eton%20suit.JPG The Eton Suit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713121708/http://www.joyceimages.com/media/ji/thumbnails/small_Eton%20suit.JPG |date=13 July 2011 }} at ''British Schoolboy Uniforms''.</ref>

== Tutors and teaching ==
Teachers are known unofficially as "beaks". The pupil to teacher ratio is 8:1,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/Facilities.aspx |title=Facilities |publisher =Eton College |year=2011}}</ref> which is extremely low by typical UK school standards. Class sizes start at around twenty to twenty-five in the first year and are often below ten by the final year.

The original curriculum concentrated on prayers, Latin and devotion, and "as late as 1530 no Greek was taught".<ref>Nevill, p.6.</ref>

Later the emphasis was on [[classical studies]], dominated by [[Latin]] and [[Ancient History]], and, for boys with sufficient ability, [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]]. From the latter part of the 19th century this curriculum has changed and broadened:<ref>See e.g. B. J. W. Hill, ''A Portrait of Eton, 1958, and Tim Card, Eton Renewed: A History of Eton College from 1860 to the Present Day'', 1994</ref> for example, there are now more than 100 students of Chinese, which is a non-curriculum course.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/departmentsqualifications.aspx#|title=Departments and Available Qualifications |publisher=Eton College |year=2008}}</ref> In the 1970s, there was just one school computer, in a small room attached to the science buildings. It used [[punched tape]] to store programs. Today, all boys must have laptop computers, and the school [[fibre-optic network]] connects all classrooms and all boys' bedrooms to the internet.<ref name=time>{{cite news |last=McAllister |first=J. F. O. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901060626-1205329-1,00.html |title=A New Kind of Elite |work=Time |location=New York |date=18 June 2006}}</ref>

The primary responsibility for a boy's studies lies with his House Master, but he is assisted by an additional director of studies, known as a tutor.<ref>McConnell, pp.70–76</ref> Classes, formally known as "divisions" ("divs"), are organised on a School basis; the classrooms are separate from the houses. New blocks of classrooms have appeared every decade or so since New Schools, designed by [[Henry Woodyer]] and built 1861–63.<ref>The Buildings of England – Buckinghamshire, Nikolaus Pevsner, 1960</ref> Despite the introduction of modern technology, the external appearance and locations of many of the classrooms have remained unchanged for a long time. The oldest classroom still in use, "Lower School", dates from the 15th century.

Every evening, about an hour and a quarter, known as Quiet Hour, is set aside, during which boys are expected to study or prepare work for their teachers if not otherwise engaged.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/Work.aspx |title=work |publisher=Eton College |year=2008}}</ref> Some Houses, at the discretion of the House Master, may observe a second Quiet Hour after prayers in the evening. This is less formal, with boys being allowed to visit each other's rooms to socialise if neither boy has work outstanding.

The [[Independent Schools Inspectorate]]'s latest report says, "The achievement of pupils is exceptional. Progress and abilities of all pupils are at a high level. Pupils are highly successful in public examinations, and the record of entrance to universities with demanding entry requirements in the United Kingdom and overseas is strong."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/InspectionReports.aspx|title=Inspection Reports |publisher=Eton College |year=2016}}</ref>

== Societies ==
At Eton, there are many organisations known as 'societies', in many of which pupils come together to discuss a particular topic or to listen to a lecture, presided over by a senior pupil, and often including a guest speaker.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/Societies.aspx |title=Societies |publisher=Eton College |year=2008 |access-date=16 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327095521/http://www.etoncollege.com/Societies.aspx |archive-date=27 March 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> At any one time there are about fifty societies and clubs in existence, catering for a wide range of interests and largely run by boys.

Societies tend to come and go, depending on the special enthusiasms of the masters and boys in the school at the time, but some have been in existence for many years. Those in existence at present include: Aeronautical, African, Alexander Cozens (Art), Amnesty, Archeological, Architectural, Astronomy, Balfour, Banks (conservation), Caledonian, Cheese, Classical, Comedy, Cosmopolitan, Debating, Design, Entrepreneurship, Francophone, Geographical, Geopolitical, Global, Henry Fielding, Hispanic, History, Keynes (economics), Law, Literary, Mathematical, Medical, Middle Eastern, Model United Nations, Modern Languages, Oriental, Orwell (left-wing), Simeon (Christian), Parry (music), Photographic, Political, Praed (poetry), Rock (music), Rous (equestrian), Salisbury (formerly diplomatic, now colonial history), Savile (Rare Books and Manuscripts), Shelley, Scientific, Sports, Tech Club, Theatre, Wellington (military), Wine and Wotton's (philosophy).

== Grants and prizes ==
Prizes are awarded on the results of trials (internal exams), GCSE and AS-levels. In addition, many subjects and activities have specially endowed prizes, several of which are awarded by visiting experts. The most prestigious is the [[Newcastle Scholarship]], awarded on the strength of an examination, consisting of two papers in philosophical theology, moral theory and applied ethics. Also of note is the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Coutts Prize, awarded on the results of trials and AS-level examinations in C block ([[Year Twelve|Year 12]]); and the Huxley Prize, awarded for a project on a scientific subject. Other specialist prizes include the Newcastle Classical Prize; the Rosebery Exhibition for History; the Queen's Prizes for French and German; the Duke of Newcastle's Russian Prize; the Beddington Spanish Prize; the Strafford and Bowman Shakespeare Prizes; the Tomline and Russell Prizes in Mathematics; the Sotheby Prize for History of Art; the Waddington Prize for Theology and Philosophy; the Birley Prize for History; the Rorie Mackenzie Prize for Modern Languages; The Lower Boy Rosebery Prize; the Wilder Prize for Theology and The Hervey Verse Prize for poetry in senior years. Prizes are awarded too for excellence in such activities as painting, sculpture, ceramics, playing musical instruments, musical composition, declamation, silverwork, and design.

Various benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad. These include the Busk Fund, which supports individual ventures that show particular initiative; the C. M. Wells Memorial Trust Fund, for the promotion of visits to classical lands; the Sadler Fund, which supports, among others, those intending to enter the Foreign Service; and the Marsden Fund, for travel in countries where the principal language is not English.

== Incentives and sanctions ==
Eton has a well-established system for encouraging boys to produce high-standard work. An excellent piece of work may be rewarded with a "Show Up", to be shown to the boy's tutors as evidence of progress.<ref name="McConnell, p.84">McConnell, p.84</ref> If, in any particular term, a pupil makes a particularly good effort in any subject, he may be "Commended for Good Effort" to the Head Master (or Lower Master).

If any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be "Sent Up For Good",<ref name="McConnell, p.84" /> storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity. This award has been around since the 18th century. As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton's boys. First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department. Upon receiving his or her approval, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the student will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.

The opposite of a Show Up is a "Rip".<ref>McConnell, pp.82–83</ref> This is for sub-standard work, which is sometimes torn at the top of the page/sheet and must be submitted to the boy's housemaster for signature. Boys who accumulate rips are liable to be given a "White Ticket", a form of a progress report which must be signed at intervals by all his teachers and may be accompanied by other punishments, usually involving doing domestic chores or [[School punishment#Writing lines|writing lines]]. In recent times,{{when|date=April 2012}} a milder form of the rip, 'sign for information', colloquially known as an "info", has been introduced, which must also be signed by the boy's housemaster and tutor.

Internal examinations are held at the end of the Michaelmas half (i.e. autumn term) for all pupils, and in the Summer half for those in the first, second and fourth years (i.e. those not taking a full set of public examinations). These internal examinations are called "Trials".<ref>McConnell, pp.85–89</ref>

A boy who is late for any division or other appointments may be required to sign "Tardy Book", a register kept in the School Office, between 7:35 am and 7:45 am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days).<ref>McConnell, p.42</ref> Tardy Book may also be issued for late work. For more serious misdeeds, a boy is placed "on the Bill", which involves him being summoned by the sudden entry of a prefect into one of his divisions, who announces in a loud and formal tone that at a given time a certain pupil must attend the office of the Head Master, or Lower Master if the boy is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds.<ref name="McConnell, pp.83-84">McConnell, pp.83–84</ref> The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, or [[Rustication (academia)|rustication]] (suspension) or in former times, beating. Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils may claim it as a "run" and absent themselves for the rest of its duration, provided they report their intention so to do at the school office.

A traditional punishment took the form of being made to copy, by hand, Latin [[hexameters]]. Offenders were frequently set 100 hexameters by Library members, or, for more serious offences, [[Georgics]] (more than 500 hexameters) by their House Masters or the Head Master.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6351331.stm |title=Cameron defiant over drug claims |publisher=BBC News |date=11 February 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref> The giving of a Georgic is now extremely rare, but still occasionally occurs.

=== Corporal punishment ===
Eton used to be renowned for its use of [[school corporal punishment|corporal punishment]], generally known as "beating". In the 16th century, Friday was set aside as "flogging day".<ref name="Nevill, p.9">Nevill, p.9.</ref> A special wooden birching block was used for the purpose, with the boy being directed to fetch it and then kneel over it.

Beating was phased out in the 1980s. The film director [[Sebastian Doggart]] claims to have been the last boy caned at Eton, in 1984.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/expateducation/8530207/Schools-in-Sweden-cant-be-beaten-corporal-punishment-around-the-world.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=26 May 2011 |title=Schools in Sweden can't be beaten: corporal punishment around the world |author=Doggart, Sebastian}}</ref>

[[John Keate]], Head Master from 1809 to 1834, took over at a time when discipline was poor. Until 1964, offending boys could be summoned to the Head Master or the Lower Master, as appropriate, to receive a [[birching]] on the bare posterior, in a semi-public ceremony held in the Library, where there was a special wooden birching block over which the offender was held.  [[Anthony Chenevix-Trench]], Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with [[caning]], also applied to the bare buttocks, which he administered privately in his office.<ref>Onyeama, Dillibe (1972). ''Nigger at Eton''. London: Leslie Frewin. p.100. {{ISBN|978-0-85632-003-3}}</ref> Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys. Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane offenders over the seat of the trousers. This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table. Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see [[Eton college#Prefects|Eton Society]] below) in the form of a "Pop-Tanning", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke). The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds. This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.<ref>Cheetham, Anthony; Parfit, Derek (1964). ''Eton Microcosm''. London: Sidgwick & Jackson. {{OCLC|7396426}}</ref>

Chenevix-Trench's successor from 1970, [[Michael McCrum]], retained private corporal punishment by masters but ended the practice of requiring boys to take their trousers and underwear down when bending over to be caned by the Head Master. By the mid-1970s, the only people allowed to administer caning were the Head Master and the Lower Master.<ref>{{cite book |author=Dixon, Mark |title=An Eton Schoolboy's Album |year=1985 |publisher=Debrett's |location=London |page=95 |isbn=978-0-905649-78-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/etonschoolboysal0000dixo |url-access=registration }}</ref>

== Prefects ==
In addition to the masters, the following three categories of senior boys are entitled to exercise School discipline. Boys who belong to any of these categories, in addition to a limited number of other boy office holders, are entitled to wear winged collars with bow ties.
* <span id="Eton Society">'''Pop:'''</span> officially known as 'Eton Society',<ref>McConnell, pp.57–58</ref> a highly glamorous high-status elite society comprising the most popular, well-regarded, confident and able senior boys. It is thus truly an elite within an elite. It is a driving ambition of many capable Eton schoolboys to be elected to Pop, and many high-performers who are refused entry to this elite consider their careers at Eton a failure. [[Boris Johnson]] was a member of Pop, whilst [[David Cameron]] (unlike his elder brother [[Alexander Cameron (barrister)|Alexander]]) failed to be elected, a fact which possibly fed their later political rivalry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-best-of-enemies-david-cameron-vs-boris-johnson-2335578.html|title=The best of enemies: David Cameron vs Boris Johnson|date=11 August 2011|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> Over the years its power and privileges have grown. Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton. The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters. Members of Pop wear white and black [[houndstooth]]-checked trousers, a starched stick-up collar and white bow-tie, and are entitled to wear flamboyant waistcoats, often of their own design. Historically, only members of Pop were entitled to furl their umbrellas<ref>Nevill, p.35.</ref> or sit on the wall on the Long Walk, in front of the main building. However, this tradition has died out. They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including School Plays, parents' evenings and other official events, and generally maintain order. Notable ex-members of Pop include [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] (unlike his younger brother [[Prince Harry]], who failed to be elected <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/what-was-it-like-to-go-to-school-with-prince-harry.html|title=What Was It Like to Go to School With Prince Harry?|date=18 May 2018}}</ref>); [[Eddie Redmayne]]; and [[Boris Johnson]].
* <span id="SixthFormSelect">'''Sixth Form Select:'''</span> an academically selected prefectorial group consisting, by custom, of the 10 senior King's Scholars and the 10 senior Oppidan Scholars.<ref>McConnell, pp.57, 129–137</ref> Members of Sixth Form Select are entitled to wear silver buttons on their waistcoats. They also act as Praepostors: they enter classrooms in mid-lesson without knocking and ask in a loud and formal tone, "Is ([[family name]]) in this division?" followed by "He is to see the Head Master at (time) on the bill" (the ''Bill'', see above).<ref name="McConnell, pp.83-84" /> Members of Sixth Form Select also perform "Speeches", a formal event held five times a year.
* <span id="House Captains">'''House Captains:'''</span> The captains of each of the 25 boys' houses (see above) have disciplinary powers at school level.<ref>McConnell, pp.59–62</ref> House Captains are entitled to wear a mottled-grey waistcoat.

It is possible to belong to ''Pop'' and ''Sixth Form Select'' at the same time.

In the era of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] there were two praepostors in every form, who noted down the names of absentees. Until the late 19th century, there was a praepostor for every division of the school.<ref name="Nevill, p.9" />

== Sport ==
Sport is a feature of Eton; which has nearly 200 acres of playing fields and amenity land.<ref>Patrick Bond and Peter Brown, ''Rating Valuation: Principles and Practice'' (3rd edition, 2014 Routledge, London and New York), at [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cD_XAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq=land+acres+%22eton+college%22+%22playing+fields%22&source=bl&ots=Ul24-BsNe2&sig=ACfU3U1OuO4nN5iRvYuMrA1e8rkQjWy2wQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjfxvGN89XlAhXwSxUIHQcyAyI4ChDoATAAegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=land%20acres%20%22eton%20college%22%20%22playing%20fields%22&f=false page 271]</ref> The names of the playing fields include Agar's Plough, Dutchman's, Upper Club, Lower Club, Sixpenny/The Field, and Mesopotamia (situated between two streams and often shortened to "Mespots").
* During the Michaelmas Half, the sport curriculum is dominated by [[soccer|football]] (called ''Association'') and [[rugby union]], with some rowing for a smaller number of boys.
* During the Lent Half it is dominated by the [[Eton Field Game|field game]], a [[football|code of football]], but this is unique to Eton and cannot be played against other schools. During this half, Collegers also play the [[Eton wall game]]; this game received national publicity when it was taken up by [[Prince Harry]].  Aided by [[AstroTurf]] facilities on Masters' field, [[field hockey]] has become a major Lent Half sport along with [[Rugby 7's]].  Elite [[Rowing (sport)|rowers]] prepare for the [[Schools' Head of the River Race]] in late March.
* During the Summer Half, sporting boys divide into ''dry bobs'', who play cricket, tennis or [[sport of athletics|athletics]], and ''wet bobs'', who row on the River Thames and the rowing lake in preparation for [[The National Schools Regatta]] and the [[Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup]] at [[Henley Royal Regatta]].

The [[Dorney Lake|rowing lake at Dorney]] was developed and is owned by the college.   It was the venue for the [[Sport rowing|rowing]] and [[Canoeing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|canoeing]] events at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and the World Junior Rowing Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorneylake.com/ |title=Welcome to Dorney Lake |publisher=Dorneylake.com |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>

The [[Eton v Harrow|annual cricket match]] against [[Harrow School|Harrow]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] is the oldest fixture of the cricketing calendar, having been played there since 1805. A staple of the London society calendar since the 1800s,<ref name="world and its people">{{cite book |last=Dunton |first=Larkin |location=Boston, MA |title=The World and Its People |url=https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog |publisher=Silver, Burdett|oclc=4352850 |year=1896 |page=[https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog/page/n49 41]}}</ref> in 1914, its importance was such that over 38,000 people attended the two days' play, and in 1910 [[Fowler's match|the match]] made national headlines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/143944.html |title=Fowler's match, 1910 |publisher=Content-www.cricinfo.com |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1910S/1910/ENG_LOCAL/OTHER/ETON_HARROW_08-09JUL1910.html |title=Eton & Harrow match scorecard 1910 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=3 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810223339/http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1910S/1910/ENG_LOCAL/OTHER/ETON_HARROW_08-09JUL1910.html |archive-date=10 August 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> But interest has since declined considerably, and the match is now a one-day [[Limited overs cricket|limited overs]] contest.

There is a running track at the Thames Valley Athletics Centre and an annual [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]]. The running track was controversial as it was purchased with a £3m [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] grant with the school getting full daytime use of the facilities in exchange for £200k and {{Convert|4.5|acre|hectare}} of land.  The bursar claimed that Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic club was "deprived" because it did not have a world-class running track and facilities for training and the [[Sports Council]] agreed,saying the whole community would benefit. However Steve Osborn, director of the Safe Neighbourhoods Unit, described the decision as "staggering" given substantial reduction in youth services by councils across the country.<ref name=indy>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/pounds-3m-lottery-cash-for-eton-sports-centre-1595502.html|title=£3m lottery cash for Eton sports centre:Top school gets exclusive deal |work=The Independent|author=Danny Penman|date=10 August 1995|accessdate=2 Aug 2010}}</ref>  The facility which became the Thames Valley Athletics Centre opened in April 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runtrackdir.com/details.asp?track=eton|title=Eton:Thames Valley Athletics Centre|accessdate=18 July 2020}}</ref>

Among the other sports played at Eton is [[Eton Fives]].

In 1815, Eton College documented its football rules, the first football code to be written down anywhere in the world.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of British Football|author=Cox, Richard W. |author2=Russell, Dave |author3=Vamplew, Wray|publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8|page=243|location=London}}</ref>

=== Olympic rowing ===
In 2006,<ref name=DorneyLake>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorneylake.co.uk/2012-dorneylake.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527180749/http://www.dorneylake.co.uk/2012-dorneylake.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 May 2013|title=Dorney Lake – London 2012|work=Dorney Lake.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> six years before the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|London 2012 Summer Paralympic Games]], Eton completed the construction of [[Dorney Lake]], a permanent, eight-lane, 2,200 metre course (about 1.4 miles) in a 400-acre park. Eton financed the construction from its own funds. Officially known throughout the Games as ''Eton Dorney'', Dorney Lake provided training facilities for Olympic and Paralympic competitors, and during the Games, hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Rowing competitions as well as the Olympic Canoe Sprint event.<ref name=DorneyLake /> It attracted over 400,000 visitors during the Games period (around 30,000 per day), and was voted the best 2012 Olympic venue by spectators.<ref name=DorneyLake /> Thirty medal events were held on Dorney Lake, during which Team GB won a total of 12 medals, making the lake one of the most successful venues for Team GB. The [[International Rowing Federation|FISA]] President, [[Denis Oswald]], described it as "the best-ever Olympic rowing venue".<ref name=DorneyLake /> In June 2013, it hosted the [[World Rowing Cup]]. Access to the parkland around the Lake is provided to members of the public, free of charge, almost all the year round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorneylake.co.uk/visiting.html |title=Dorney Lake – Leisure |work=Dorney Lake.co.uk |year=2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622140947/http://www.dorneylake.co.uk/visiting.html |archivedate=22 June 2013}}</ref>

== Music and drama ==

=== Music ===
The current "Precentor" (Head of Music) is Tim Johnson, and the School has eight organs and an entire building for music (performance spaces include the School Hall, the Farrer Theatre and two halls dedicated to music, the Parry Hall and the Concert Hall). Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones such as the [[didgeridoo]]. The School participates in many national competitions; many pupils are part of the [[National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain|National Youth Orchestra]], and the School gives scholarships for dedicated and talented musicians. A former Precentor of the college, [[Ralph Allwood]] set up and organised [[Eton Choral Courses]], which run at the School every summer.

In 2009, the School's musical protégés came to wider notice when featured in a TV documentary ''A Boy Called Alex''. The film followed an Etonian, [[Alex Stobbs]], a musician with [[cystic fibrosis]], as he worked toward conducting the difficult ''[[Magnificat (Bach)|Magnificat]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1177981/|title="Cutting Edge" A Boy Called Alex (TV Episode 2008)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/cutting_edge/alex/ |title=''Cutting Edge'' |publisher=Channel4.com |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>

=== Drama ===
[[File:Farrer Theatre.JPG|thumb|right|The exterior of Eton's main theatre, the ''Farrer''.]]

Numerous plays are put on every year at Eton College; there is one main theatre, called the Farrer (seating 400) and 2 Studio theatres, called the Caccia Studio and Empty Space (seating 90 and 80 respectively). There are about 8 or 9 house productions each year, around 3 or 4 "independent" plays (not confined solely to one house, produced, directed and funded by Etonians) and three school plays, one specifically for boys in the first two years, and two open to all years. The School Plays have such good reputations that they are normally fully booked every night.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Productions also take place in varying locations around the School, varying from the sports fields to more historic buildings such as Upper School and College Chapel.

In recent years, the School has put on a musical version of ''[[The Bacchae]]'' (October 2009) as well as productions of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (May 2010), ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' (February 2011), ''[[Joseph K]]'' (October 2011), ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (May 2012), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (October 2012), ''[[London Assurance]]'' (May 2013), ''[[Jerusalem (play)|Jerusalem]]'' (October 2013), ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (May 2014), "[[Antigone]]" (October 2015), "[[The Government Inspector]]" (May 2016) and "[[Romeo and Juliet]]" (May 2017). On top of this, every three years, the School holds a fringe-style School Play Festival, where students and teachers write, direct and act in their own plays, hosted over the period of a week. The most recent one was held in October 2016, which hosted a wide variety of plays, from a double bill of two half an hour plays, to a serialised radio drama, written by a boy in F block (the youngest year.)

Often girls from surrounding schools, such as [[St. George's School, Ascot|St George's, Ascot]], [[St Mary's School Ascot]], [[Windsor Girls' School]] and [[Heathfield St Mary's School]], are cast in female roles. Boys from the School are also responsible for the lighting, sound and stage management of all the productions, under the guidance of several professional full-time theatre staff.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ft.etononline.net/home/ |title=Summer 2013 |work=The Farrer Theatre Online |publisher=Eton College |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822133115/http://ft.etononline.net/home/ |archivedate=22 August 2012}}</ref>

Every year, Eton employs a 'Director-in-Residence', an external professional director on a one-year contract who normally directs one house play and the Lower Boy play (a school play open solely to the first two-year groups), as well as teaching Drama and Theatre Studies to most year groups.

The drama department is headed by Scott Handy (taking over from Hailz Osbourne in 2015) and several other teachers; [[Simon Dormandy]] was on the staff until late 2012. The School offers GCSE drama as well as A-level "English with Theatre Studies."

== Celebrations ==
Eton's best-known holiday takes place on the so-called "Fourth of June", a celebration of the birthday of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], Eton's greatest patron.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,741919-4,00.html |title=Beside Windsor |work=Time |location=New York |date=29 June 1931}}</ref> This day is celebrated with the Procession of Boats, in which the top rowing crews from the top four years row past in vintage wooden rowing boats. Similar to the [[Queen's Official Birthday]], the "Fourth of June" is no longer celebrated on 4 June, but on the Wednesday before the first weekend of June. Eton also observes [[St. Andrew's Day]], on which the [[Eton wall game]] is played.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

== School magazines ==
''The Chronicle'' is the official school magazine, having been founded in 1863.<ref name="Nevill, p.25">Nevill, p.25.</ref> It is edited by boys at the school. Although liable to censorship, it has a tradition of satirising and attacking school policies, as well as documenting recent events. ''The Oppidan'', founded in 1828,<ref name="Nevill, p.25" /> was published once a half; it covered all sport in Eton and some professional events as well, but no longer exists.

Other school magazines, including ''The Spectrum'' (the Academic Yearbook), ''The Arts Review'', and ''The Eton Zeitgeist'' have been published, as well as publications produced by individual departments such as ''The Cave'' (philosophy), ''Etonomics'' (economics), ''The Axiom'' (mathematics), ''Scientific Etonian'' (science), ''Timeline'' (history), ''Praed'' (poetry and song), ''The Mayflower'' (English), and ''The Lexicon'' (modern languages).

== Charitable status and fees ==
Until 18 December 2010, Eton College was an ''[[exempt charity]]'' under English law (Charities Act 1993, Schedule 2). Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an ''[[excepted charity]]'', and fully registered with the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charities Commission]],<ref>[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1139086&SubsidiaryNumber=0 Eton College Registration with Charity Commission]. 18 December 2010. Retrieved 21 December 2011.</ref> and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the UK.<ref>Ranked by total annual income averaged over three years. {{cite journal|title=Charity 100 Index|journal=Charity Finance|date=April 2008|issn=0963-0295}}</ref> As a charity, it benefits from substantial [[tax break]]s. It was calculated by the late [[David Jewell]], former Master of [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]], that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the school about £1,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the school. This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as "assisted places") to independent schools. However, no child attended Eton on this scheme, meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the school has always been lower. Eton's former Head Master, Tony Little, has claimed that the benefits that Eton provides to the local community free of charge (use of its facilities, etc.) have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status. The fee for the academic year 2010–2011 was £29,862 (approximately US$48,600 or [[Euro|€]]35,100 as of March 2011),<ref name="fees">{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/CurrentFees.aspx |publisher=Eton College |title=School Fees 2010/2011 |year=2010}}</ref> although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships.

=== Holyport College ===
In September 2014, Eton opened, and became the sole educational sponsor for, [[Holyport College]], a new purpose-built co-educational state boarding and day school that provides free education for around 500 pupils.

=== State school pupils ===
The above-described developments are running alongside long-established courses that Eton has provided for pupils from state schools, most of them in the summer holidays (July and August).

==== Universities Summer School ====
Launched in 1982, the Universities Summer School is an intensive residential course open to boys and girls throughout the UK who attend state schools, are at the end of their first year in the Sixth Form, and are about to begin their final year of schooling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/USS.aspx|title=Universities Summer School |publisher=Eton College |year=2013}}</ref>

==== Brent-Eton Summer School ====
Launched in 1994, the Brent-Eton Summer School offers 40–50 young people from the [[London Borough of Brent]], an area of inner-city deprivation, an intensive one-week residential course, free of charge, designed to help bridge the gap between GCSE and A-level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/BrentEton.aspx |title=Brent-Eton Summer School |publisher=Eton College |year=2013}}</ref>

==== Eton, Slough, Windsor and Heston Independent and State School Partnership ====
In 2008, Eton helped found the ''Eton, Slough, Windsor and Heston Independent and State School Partnership'' (ISSP), with six local state schools. The ISSP's aims are 'to raise pupil achievement, improve pupil self-esteem, raise pupil aspirations and improve professional practice across the schools'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/ISSP.aspx |title=Eton, Slough, Windsor and Heston Independent and State School Partnership |publisher=Eton College |year=2013}}</ref> Eton also runs a number of choral and English language courses during the summer months.

== Historical relations with other schools ==
Eton College has links with some private schools in India today, maintained from the days of the [[British Raj]], such as [[The Doon School]]<ref name="BBC20050309">{{cite news |last=Lawson |first=Alastair |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4309213.stm |title=Eton, the Raj and modern India |publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2005 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref> and [[Mayo College]].<ref name="BBC20050309" /> Eton College is also a member of the [[G20 Schools]] Group, a collection of [[college preparatory]] [[boarding schools]] from around the world, including Turkey's [[Robert College]], the United States' [[Phillips Academy]] and [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], Australia's [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Launceston Church Grammar School]], Singapore's [[Raffles Institution]], and Switzerland's [[International School of Geneva]].

Eton has fostered{{when|date=April 2012}} a relationship with the [[Roxbury Latin School]], a traditional all-boys private school in Boston, US.

=== The Doon School, India ===
[[The Doon School]], founded in 1935, is an all-boys' [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in India that was modelled along the lines of Eton and Winchester.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foot |first1=A.E. |date=April 1947 |title=The Doon School |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Arts]] |volume=95 |issue=4741 |page=360 |jstor=41364317}}</ref>  The School's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was an Englishman, [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

[[Peter Lawrence (teacher)|Peter Lawrence]] was one of the first few masters to go to Doon. This led to similar slang being introduced in Doon which is still in use today, such as ''trials'', ''dame'', ''fagging'', and ''schools'' (as opposed to 'periods'). In February 2013, Eton's headmaster Tony Little visited Doon to hold talks with the then headmaster of Doon, [[Peter McLaughlin]], on further collaboration between the two schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doonschool.com/eton |title=Headmaster of Eton College visits Doon |publisher=The Doon School |year=2013 |location=Dehradun, Utterakhand |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306124323/http://www.doonschool.com/eton |archivedate=6 March 2013  }}</ref> Both schools participate in an exchange programme in which boys from either school visit the other for one academic term.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4309213.stm |title=Eton, the Raj and modern India |publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2005 |first=Alastair |last=Lawson |accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> Doon has often been described as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/12/world/india-s-old-school-tie-harrow-by-the-himalayas.html</ref> [[BBC]],<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq</ref> [[Channel 4]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/29/indian-summer-school-review-five-terrible-teens-are-sent-to-indias-equivalent-of-eton |title=Indian Summer School review – five terrible teens are sent to India's equivalent of Eton |first=Sam |last=Wollaston |date=29 March 2018 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/aug/13/fiction.arundhatiroy |title=The lost sub-continent |first=William |last=Dalrymple |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=13 August 2005 |accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'',<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/alastair-sooke/7546719/The-rise-and-rise-of-Anish-Kapoor-Inc..html |title=The rise & rise of Anish Kapoor Inc. |date=2 April 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> and ''[[Forbes]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2013/10/28/the-doon-school-grooming-ground-for-indias-wealthy-kids/ |title=The Doon School: Grooming Ground For India's Wealthy Kids |date=28 October 2013 |work=Forbes|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> but the school eschews the label.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/deep-focus/Doon-of-India-wants-to-conquer-the-globe/articleshow/6800690.cms |title='Doon of India' wants to conquer the globe |newspaper=Times of India  |date=24 October 2010 |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/put-him-down-for-doon |title=It's a spartan life at 'the Eton of India' |work=The Spectator |location=London |date=19 March 2017 |first=Will |last=Brown |accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref>
