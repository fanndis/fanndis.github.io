The '''Philippine National Police''' ({{lang-fil|Pambansang Pulisya ng Pilipinas}}, acronymed as '''PNP''') is the armed [[law enforcement agency|national police force]] in the Philippines. Its national headquarters is at [[Camp Crame]] in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]]. Currently, it has 205,000 personnel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs-idUSKBN1WT0CB|title=Top Philippine cop resigns after accusation of link to drug scandal|date=October 14, 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=October 25, 2019|language=en}}</ref>

The agency is administered and controlled by the [[National Police Commission (Philippines)|National Police Commission]] and is part of the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]] (DILG). Local police officers are operationally controlled by municipal mayors.<ref>Except during the 30 days immediately preceding and following any [[Elections in the Philippines|national, local]] and [[barangay elections]]. During these periods, the local police forces are under the supervision and control of the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]]</ref> DILG, on the other hand, organizes, trains and equips the PNP for the performance of police functions as a police force that is national in scope and civilian in character.

The PNP was formed on January 29, 1991 when the [[Philippine Constabulary]] and the [[Integrated National Police]] were merged pursuant to Republic Act 6975 of 1990.<ref name=about>[http://www.pnp.gov.ph/main/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=46:about-the-philippine-national-police&catid=25:organization&Itemid=56 About the Philippine National police] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326192226/http://www.pnp.gov.ph/main/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=46:about-the-philippine-national-police&catid=25:organization&Itemid=56 |date=March 26, 2012 }}</ref>

==="Wheel of Torture" secret detention facility===
The Philippine Commission on Human Rights filed charges against ten police officers after it was discovered that they routinely tortured detainees inside a secret detention facility in Biñan, Laguna. The facility was maintained by the PNP Provincial Intelligence Branch (PIB) to extract confessions or information from detainees, or to extort money from them in exchange for being charged with lighter offenses or the dropping of the charges altogether. It was also alleged that some "were tortured for the police officers’ [[schadenfreude|amusement]]" when they're intoxicated.  The facility is notorious for utilizing a roulette called the "Wheel of Torture", a play on the ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'',  where various torture methods were printed. The wheel is rotated and wherever the pin stops, the indicated torture method is perpetrated on the detainee.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/568875/police-torture-chamber-found-in-laguna "Police Torture Chamber Found in Laguna"].
