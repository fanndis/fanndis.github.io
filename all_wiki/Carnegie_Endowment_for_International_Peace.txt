The '''Carnegie Endowment for International Peace''' ('''CEIP''') is a nonpartisan [[foreign policy|foreign-policy]] [[think tank]] with centers in [[Washington D.C.]], [[Moscow]], [[Beirut]], [[Beijing]], [[Brussels]], and [[New Delhi]].<ref name="About Us">{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/about/ |title=About the Global Think Tank |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |date=n.d. |accessdate=2016-04-04}}</ref> Founded in 1910 by [[Andrew Carnegie]], the organization describes itself as being dedicated to advancing cooperation between nations and promoting active international engagement by the United States.

In the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s "2019 Global Go To Think Tanks Report", Carnegie was ranked the #1 top think tank in the world.<ref>https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=think_tanks</ref> In the ''2015 Global Go To Think Tanks Report'', Carnegie was ranked the third most influential think tank in the world, after the [[Brookings Institution]] and [[Chatham House]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=think_tanks | title=2015 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report | last=McGann | first=James G. | date=2 September 2016 | website=University of Pennsylvania | accessdate=20 November 2018 }}</ref> It was ranked as the top Independent Think Tank in 2018.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGann|first=James|date=2019-01-01|title=2018 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/think_tanks/16|journal=TTCSP Global Go to Think Tank Index Reports}}</ref>

Its headquarters building, prominently located on the [[Embassy Row]] section of [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]], was completed in 1989 on a design by architecture firm [[SmithGroup|Smith, Hinchman & Grylls]]. It also hosts the embassy of [[Papua New Guinea]] in the U.S.

==Organizational history==

===Establishment===
[[File:Andrew Carnegie, three-quarter length portrait, seated, facing slightly left, 1913-crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie in 1913.]]
[[Andrew Carnegie]], like other leading [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalists]] of his day, believed that war could be eliminated by stronger international laws and organizations. "I am drawn more to this cause than to any," he wrote in 1907. Carnegie's single largest commitment in this field was his creation of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.<ref name="Endowment History">{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org|title=Endowment History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013002726/http://www.carnegieendowment.org/about/index.cfm?fa=history|archive-date=2009-10-13|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref>

On his seventy-fifth birthday, November 25, 1910, Andrew Carnegie announced the establishment of the Endowment with a gift of $10 million worth of first mortgage bonds, paying a 5% rate of interest.<ref>James Langland (ed.), "Carnegie Endowment for International Peace," ''The Chicago Daily News Almanac and Year-Book for 1926.'' Chicago: Chicago Daily News Company, 1925; pg. 591.</ref> The interest income generated from these bonds was to be used to fund a new [[think tank]] dedicated to advancing the cause of world peace. In his deed of gift, presented in Washington on December 14, 1910, Carnegie charged trustees to use the fund to "hasten the abolition of international war, the foulest blot upon our civilization", and he gave his trustees "the widest discretion as to the measures and policy they shall from time to time adopt" in carrying out the purpose of the fund.<ref>{{cite book | last=Osmańczyk | first= Edmund Jan | date=2003 | title=Encyclopedia of the United Nations and international agreements | location=New York | publisher=Routledge | oclc= 50164558 }}</ref>

Carnegie chose longtime adviser [[Elihu Root]], Senator from New York and former [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] and of [[United States Secretary of State|State]], to be the Endowment's first president. Awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1912, Root served until 1925. Founder trustees included [[Harvard University]] president [[Charles William Eliot]], philanthropist [[Robert S. Brookings]], former [[U.S. Ambassador]] to Great Britain [[Joseph Hodges Choate]], former Secretary of State [[John W. Foster]], and [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] president [[Henry Smith Pritchett]].<ref name="Endowment History"/>

===The first fifty years: 1910–1960===
[[File:Carnegie Endowment for International Peace - former headquarters.JPG|thumb|right|[[Peter Parker House]] at 700 [[Jackson Place|Jackson Pl.]], NW, [[Washington, D.C.]], housed CEIP 1910–1947, when it relocated to New York City]]
At the outset of America's involvement in [[World War I]] in 1917, the Carnegie Endowment trustees unanimously declared, "the most effective means of promoting durable international peace is to prosecute the war against the Imperial Government of Germany to final victory for democracy."<ref name="Timeline 100">{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/about/timeline100/index.html |title=A Timeline of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> In December 1918, Carnegie Endowment Secretary [[James Brown Scott]] and four other Endowment personnel, including [[James T. Shotwell]], sailed with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on the [[SS George Washington|USS ''George Washington'']] to join the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|peace talks in France]].

Carnegie is often remembered for having built [[Carnegie libraries]], which were a major recipient of his largesse. The libraries were usually funded not by the Endowment but by other Carnegie trusts, operating mainly in the English-speaking world. However, after World War I the Endowment built libraries in Belgium, France<ref name="Biblio">{{cite web | url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/mil-xx_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&FIELD_1=Cmill3&VALUE_1=reims&FIELD_2=DENO&VALUE_2=&FIELD_3=Cmill1&VALUE_3=&FIELD_4=Cmill2&VALUE_4=&FIELD_5=El%e9ment%20prot%e9g%e9&VALUE_5=&NUMBER=1&GRP=0&REQ=%28%28reims%29%20%3aLOCA%2cLOCA2%20%29&USRNAME=nobody&USRPWD=4%2524%252534P&SPEC=9&SYN=1&IMLY=&MAX1=1&MAX2=1&MAX3=100&DOM=All | title=Bibliotheque Carnegie | accessdate=August 2, 2012}}</ref> and Serbia in three cities which had been badly damaged in the war. In addition, in 1918, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP) began to support a library special collection called the International Mind Alcove program which aimed to change people's global perspective, fostering an 'international mind' in America as well as in other countries.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Witt|first=Steven W.|date=November 2014|title=International Mind Alcoves: The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Libraries, and the Struggle for Global Public Opinion|journal=Library & Information History|volume=30|issue=4|pages=273–290|via=JSTOR|doi=10.1179/1758348914Z.00000000068}}</ref> The foundational idea behind the program was that internationalism would replace nationalism and people would be more inclined toward peace once they had a greater understanding of different cultures. This program was established in 1918 after World War I and by 1924 had grown significantly, “with eighty-one collections in the US and twenty-two in other countries”.<ref name=":0" /> After the US entered World War II, the International Mind Alcove collections were “repackaged” to support the state, although the collection didn’t change.<ref name=":0" /> After World War II, the United Nations began promoting the idea of internationalism, eventually leading the CEIP to end the International Mind Alcove program.<ref name=":0" /> Early in the 1950s, the CEIP came under scrutiny by the US Congress for subversive activities during the anti-communist atmosphere at that time. Mainly, the Alcove project and the books that were disseminated under this international program were the focus of the investigation. The books were reviewed by a political science professor, who concluded that the books did not “promote the national interest”.<ref name=":0" /> At that point it was irrelevant since the program was being eliminated, but the findings supported the charge of subversion, stating the idea of internationalism contributes to the “degradation of American ‘nationalism’”. By 1958 the CEIP had ended funding for the program, ending its mission, completely unrelated to the Congressional investigation.<ref name=":0" />

On July 14, 1923, the [[Hague Academy of International Law]], an initiative of the Endowment, was formally opened in the [[Peace Palace]] at [[The Hague]]. 
The Peace Palace had been built by the [[Carnegie Foundation (Netherlands)]] in 1913 to house the Permanent Court of Arbitration and a [[Peace Palace Library|library of international law]].

In 1925, [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] succeeded Elihu Root as president of the Endowment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml/units/carnegie/ceip.html|title=Carnegie Endowment of International Peace Records|website=www.library.columbia.edu}}</ref> For his work, including his involvement with the [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]], Butler was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1931/ |title=Nobel Peace Prize 1931 |publisher=Nobel Prize |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>

In November 1944, the Carnegie Endowment published [[Raphael Lemkin]]'s ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation—Analysis of Government—Proposals for Redress''. The work was the first to bring the word ''[[genocide]]'' into the global lexicon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/genocide/take_action/gallery/portrait/lemkin/ |title=About Raphael Lemkin |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=2012-03-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229135507/http://www.ushmm.org/genocide/take_action/gallery/portrait/lemkin |archive-date=2012-02-29 }}</ref> In April 1945, [[James T. Shotwell]], director of the Carnegie Endowment's Division of Economics and History, served as chairman of the semiofficial consultants to the U.S. delegation at the San Francisco conference to draw up the [[United Nations Charter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Winter2005/llshotwell.html |title=James T. Shotwell: A Life Devoted to Organizing Peace |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> As chairman, Shotwell pushed for an amendment to establish a permanent [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], which exists to this day.

In December 1945, Butler stepped down after twenty years as president and chairman of the board of trustees. Butler was the last living member of the original board selected by Andrew Carnegie in 1910.<ref name="100 Years">{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/about/CarnegieBrochure.pdf |title=100 Years of Impact |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> [[John Foster Dulles]] was elected to succeed Butler as chairman of the Board of Trustees, where he served until fellow board member [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was elected president of the U.S. in 1952 and appointed Dulles Secretary of State.<ref name="100 Years"/>

In 1946, [[Alger Hiss]] succeeded Butler as president of the Endowment but resigned in 1949 after being denounced as a [[communist]] and a spy by [[Whittaker Chambers]] and on December 15, 1948, indicted by the [[United States Department of Justice]] on two counts of [[perjury]]. Hiss was replaced in the interim by [[James T. Shotwell]].

In 1947, the Carnegie Endowment's headquarters were moved closer to the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]], while the Washington office at [[Peter Parker House]] (700 [[Jackson Place|Jackson Pl.]], NW) became a subsidiary branch.<ref name="Timeline 100"/>

In 1949, the Washington branch was shuttered.<ref name="Timeline 100"/>

In 1950, the Endowment board of trustees appointed [[Joseph E. Johnson (government official)|Joseph E. Johnson]], a historian and former State Department official, to take the helm.

===The Cold War years: 1960–1990===

In 1963, the Carnegie Endowment reconstituted its International Law Program in order to address several emerging international issues: the increase in significance and impact of international organizations; the technological revolution that facilitated the production of new military weaponry; the spread of Communism; the surge in newly independent states; and the challenges of new forms of economic activity, including global corporations and intergovernmental associations. The program resulted in the New York-based Study Group on the United Nations and the International Organization Study Group at the European Centre in [[Geneva]].<ref name="Timeline 100"/>
In 1970, [[Thomas L. Hughes]] became the sixth president of the Carnegie Endowment. Hughes moved the Endowment's headquarters from New York to Washington, D.C., and closed the Endowment's European Centre in Geneva.

The Carnegie Endowment acquired full ownership of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine in the spring of 1978. The Endowment published ''Foreign Policy'' for 30 years, moving it from a quarterly academic journal to a bi-monthly glossy covering the nexus of [[globalization]] and international policy. The magazine was sold to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 2008.

In 1981, Carnegie Endowment Associate [[Fred Bergsten]] co-founded the Institute for International Economics—today known as the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]].

Citing the growing danger of a [[nuclear arms race]] between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], [[Thomas L. Hughes]] formed an eighteen-member Task Force on Non-Proliferation and South Asian Security to propose methods for reducing the growing nuclear tensions on the subcontinent.<ref name="Timeline 100"/>
In 1989, two former Carnegie associates, Barry Blechman and Michael Krepon, founded the [[Henry L. Stimson Center]].

===After the Cold War: 1990–2000===

In 1991, [[Morton Abramowitz]] was named the seventh president of the Endowment. Abramowitz, previously a State Department official, focused the Endowment's attention on Russia in the post-Soviet era.<ref name="Timeline 100"/> In this spirit, the Carnegie Endowment opened the [[Carnegie Moscow Center]] in 1994 as a home of Russian scholar-commentators.<ref name="Carnegie Russia">{{cite web|url=http://carnegie.ru/about/?lang=en |title=About the Carnegie Moscow Center |publisher=Carnegie Moscow Center|accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>

[[Jessica Mathews]] joined the Carnegie Endowment as its eighth president in May 1997. Under her leadership, Carnegie's goal was to become the first multinational/global think tank.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carnegieendowment.org/about/index.cfm?fa=centennial |title=About the Carnegie Endowment |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |accessdate=2012-03-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130130639/http://carnegieendowment.org/about/index.cfm?fa=centennial |archive-date=2012-01-30 }}</ref>

In 2000, [[Jessica Mathews]] announced the creation of the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) headed by [[Demetrios Papademetriou]] which became the first stand-alone think tank concerned with international migration.<ref name="Timeline 100"/>

===The Global Think Tank: 2000–present===

As first laid out with the ''Global Vision'' in 2007, the Carnegie Endowment aspired to be the first global think tank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/2007/02/06/carnegie-new-vision-launch/w9t |title=A New Vision for the Carnegie Endowment |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> [[Jessica Mathews]] said that her aim was to make Carnegie the place that brings what the world thinks into thinking about U.S. policy and to communicate that thinking to a global audience.<ref name="100 Years"/>
During Mathews' tenure as president, the Carnegie Endowment launched the Carnegie Middle East Center in [[Beirut]] (2006), Carnegie Europe in [[Brussels]] (2007), and the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center at the [[Tsinghua University]] in [[Beijing]] (2010). Additionally, in partnership with the [[al-Farabi Kazakh National University]], Carnegie established the Al-Farabi Carnegie Program on Central Asia in [[Kazakhstan]] in late 2011.

In February 2015, Jessica T. Mathews stepped down as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace after 18 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/about/jessica-mathews|title=Celebrating the Presidency of Jessica T.
