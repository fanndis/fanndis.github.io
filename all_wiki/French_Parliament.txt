The '''French Parliament''' ({{lang-fr|Parlement français}}) is the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature of the [[France|French Republic]], consisting of the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] ({{lang|fr|Sénat}}) and the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] ({{lang|fr|Assemblée nationale}}). Each assembly conducts legislative sessions at a separate location in Paris: the {{lang|fr|[[Luxembourg Palace|Palais du Luxembourg]]}} for the Senate and the {{lang|fr|[[Palais Bourbon]]}} for the National Assembly.

Each house has its own regulations and rules of procedure. However, they may occasionally meet as a single house, the [[Congress of the French Parliament|French Congress]] ({{lang|fr|Congrès du Parlement français}}), convened at the [[Palace of Versailles]], to revise and amend the [[Constitution of France]].

==Organization and powers==
{{Politics of France}}
Parliament meets for a single, nine-month session each year. Under special circumstances the [[President of France|President]] can call an additional session. While parliamentary power has been diminished since the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], the National Assembly can still cause a government to fall if an [[absolute majority]] of the legislators votes a [[motion of no confidence]]. As a result, the government normally is from the same political party as the Assembly and must be supported by a majority there to prevent a vote of no-confidence.

However, the President appoints the Prime Minister and the ministers and is under no constitutional, mandatory obligation to make those appointments from the ranks of the parliamentary majority party; this is a safe-guard specifically introduced by the founder of the Fifth Republic, [[Charles de Gaulle|Charles De Gaulle]], to prevent the disarray and horse-trading caused by the Third and Fourth Republics parliamentary regimes; in practice the prime minister and ministers do come from the majority although President [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]] did appoint Socialist ministers or secretary of state-level junior ministers to his government. Rare periods during which the [[President of France|President]] is not from the same political party as the Prime Minister are usually known as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]. The President rather than the prime minister heads the [[Cabinet of France|Cabinet of Ministers]].

The government (or, when it sits in session every Wednesday, the [[Cabinet of France|cabinet]]) has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament. The government also can link its term to a legislative text which it proposes, and unless a motion of censure is introduced (within 24 hours after the proposal) and passed (within 48 hours of introduction &ndash; thus full procedures last at most 72 hours), the text is considered adopted without a vote. However, this procedure has been limited by the 2008 constitutional amendment. Legislative initiative rests with the National Assembly.

Legislators enjoy [[parliamentary immunity]].<ref>In France, for nearly a century, the article 121 of the Penal Code punished with civic degradation all police officers, all prosecutors and all judges if they had caused, issued or signed a judgment, an order or a warrant, tending to a personal process or an accusation against a member of the Senate or of the legislative body, without the authorization prescribed by the Constitutions:  {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Immunità parlamentari: Why not?|journal= L'Ago e Il Filo|date=2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89423966}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> Both assemblies have committees that write reports on a variety of topics. If necessary, they can establish parliamentary enquiry commissions with broad investigative power. However, the latter possibility is almost never exercised, since the majority can reject a proposition by the opposition to create an investigation commission. Also, such a commission may only be created if it does not interfere with a judiciary investigation, meaning that in order to cancel its creation, one just needs to press charges on the topic concerned by the investigation commission. Since 2008, the opposition may impose the creation of an investigation commission once a year, even against the wishes of the majority. However, they still can't lead investigations if there is a judiciary case going on already (or started after the commission was formed).

==History==
The French Parliament, as a legislative body, should not be confused with the various [[parlement]]s of the [[Ancien Régime in France]], which were courts of justice and tribunals with certain political functions varying from province to province and as to whether the local law was written and Roman, or customary common law.

The word "Parliament", in the modern meaning of the term, appeared in France in the 19th century, at the time of the constitutional monarchy of 1830–1848. It is never mentioned in any constitutional text until the Constitution of the 4th Republic in 1948. Before that time reference was made to "les Chambres"  or to each assembly, whatever its name, but never to a generic term as in Britain.   Its form &ndash; [[unicameral]], [[bicameral]], or multicameral &ndash; and its functions have taken different forms throughout the different political regimes and according to the various French constitutions:
