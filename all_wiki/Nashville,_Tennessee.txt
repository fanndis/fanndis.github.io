'''Nashville''' is the [[Capital city|capital]] and [[List of municipalities in Tennessee|most populous city]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Tennessee]]. The city is the [[county seat]] of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] and is located on the [[Cumberland River]].<ref name="GR6">{{cite web |url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> It is the [[List of United States cities by population|23rd most-populous city in the United States]].

Named for [[Francis Nash]], a general of the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], the city was founded in 1779. The city grew quickly due to its strategic location as a port on the Cumberland River and, in the 19th century, a railroad center. Nashville seceded with Tennessee during the [[American Civil War]]; in 1862 it was the first state capital in the Confederacy to fall to Union troops. After the war, the city reclaimed its position and developed a manufacturing base.

Since 1963, Nashville has had a [[consolidated city-county]] government, which includes six smaller municipalities in a two-tier system. The city is governed by a mayor, a vice-mayor, and a 40-member metropolitan council; 35 of the members are elected from [[single-member district]]s, while the other five are elected [[at-large]]. Reflecting the city's position in state government, Nashville is home to the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]]'s courthouse for [[Middle Tennessee]], one of the state's [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|three divisions]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Nashville, Tennessee|Timeline of Nashville, Tennessee}}

===18th and 19th centuries===
The town of Nashville was founded by [[James Robertson (explorer)|James Robertson]], [[John Donelson]], and a party of [[Overmountain Men]] in 1779, near the original Cumberland settlement of [[Fort Nashborough]]. It was named for [[Francis Nash]], the [[American Revolutionary War]] hero. Nashville quickly grew because of its strategic location as a port on the [[Cumberland River]], a tributary of the [[Ohio River]]; and its later status as a major railroad center. By 1800, the city had 345 residents, including 136 enslaved African Americans and 14 free African Americans.<ref name=SP1L132>{{Cite book |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-0-8078-3151-9 |last=Cumfer |first=Cynthia |title=Separate peoples, one land: The minds of Cherokees, Blacks, and Whites on the Tennessee frontier |location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina |date=2007 |page=132}}</ref> In 1806, Nashville was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a city and became the [[county seat]] of [[Davidson County, Tennessee]]. In 1843, the city was named as the permanent capital of the state of [[Tennessee]].

The city government of Nashville owned 24 slaves by 1831, and 60 prior to the Civil War. They were "put to work to build the first successful water system and maintain the streets."<ref name="slavemarketincludedauction"/> Auction blocks and brokers' offices were part of the slave market at the heart of the city.<ref name="slavemarketincludedauction">{{cite news |last1=Zepp |first1=George |title=Slave market included auction blocks, brokers offices in downtown Nashville |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112668696/?terms=%22Rees%2BW.%2BPorter%22 |accessdate=April 7, 2018 |work=The Tennessean |date=April 30, 2003 |page=16 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=registration}}</ref> It was the center of plantations cultivating tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, in addition to the breeding and training of thoroughbred horses, and other livestock. For years Nashville was considered one of the wealthiest southern capitals and a large portion of its prominence was from the iron business.

The [[Nashville, Tennessee cholera epidemic (1849–50)|cholera epidemic]] that struck Nashville in 1849–1850 took the life of former U.S. President [[James K. Polk]] and resulted in high fatalities.

Before the Civil War, about 700 free Blacks lived in small enclaves in northern Nashville while there were over 3,200 Black slaves in the city.<ref name=BitterSoutherner>{{cite web |url=https://bittersoutherner.com/how-hot-chicken-really-happened/ |title=How Hot Chicken Really Happened |website=The Bitter Southerner |last=Martin |first=Rachel L. |year=2018}}</ref> By 1860, when the first [[American Civil War|rumblings of secession]] began to be heard across the [[Southern United States|South]], antebellum Nashville was a prosperous city. The city's significance as a shipping port and rail center made it a desirable prize for competing military forces that wanted to control the region's important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first Confederate state capital to fall to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops, and the state was occupied by Union troops for the duration of the war. Then African Americans from Middle Tennessee fled to contraband camps around military installations in Nashville's eastern, western, and southern borders. The [[Battle of Nashville]] (December 15–16, 1864) was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war; it was also the war's final major military action in which Tennessee regiments played a large part on both sides of the battle. Afterward, the Confederates conducted a [[war of attrition]], making [[guerrilla]] raids and engaging in small skirmishes, with the Confederate forces in the [[Deep South]] almost constantly in retreat.

In 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, the Nashville chapter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was founded by Confederate veteran [[John W. Morton (Tennessee politician)|John W. Morton]]. He was reported to have initiated General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] into the vigilante organization.<ref name="tennesseanobit">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/119557576/?terms=%22John%2BW.%2BMorton%22 |title=John W.

Whites directed violence against freedmen and their descendants both during and after the [[Reconstruction era]]. Two freedmen, [[Lynching of David Jones|David Jones]] and [[Lynching of Jo Reed|Jo Reed]], were lynched in Nashville by White mobs in 1872 and 1875, respectively.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Night of Excitement.

In 1873 Nashville suffered another cholera epidemic, along with towns throughout Sumner County along railroad routes and the Cumberland River.

Meanwhile, the city had reclaimed its important shipping and trading position and developed a solid manufacturing base.

===20th century===
[[File:Sky line view of Nashville, Tenn (74039).jpg|thumb|Depiction of Nashville skyline c. 1940s|alt=|left]]
By the turn of the century, Nashville had become the cradle of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]]. The first chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] was founded here, and the ''[[Confederate Veteran]]'' magazine was published here. Most "guardians of the Lost Cause" lived Downtown or in the West End, near [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]].<ref name="simpson29">{{cite book |last1=Simpson |first1=John A. |title=Edith D.

At the same time, [[Jefferson Street (Nashville)|Jefferson Street]] became the historic center of the African American community, with similar districts developing in the Black neighborhoods in East and North Nashville. In 1912, the [[Tennessee State University|Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial and Normal School]] as moved to Jefferson Street.<ref name=BitterSoutherner /> The first [[Prince's Hot Chicken Shack]] originated at the corner of Jefferson Street and 28th Avenue in 1945.<ref name=BitterSoutherner /> Jefferson Street became a destination for jazz and blues musicians,<ref name=BitterSoutherner /> and remained so until the federal government split the area by construction of [[Interstate 40]] in the late 1960s.<ref name="tennesseanfootpathbecame">{{cite news |last1=Deville |first1=Nancy |title=Footpath became heart of city's black middle class.

In 1950 the state legislature approved a new city charter that provided for the election of city council members from [[single-member district]]s, rather than [[at-large]] voting. This change was supported because at-large voting required candidates to gain a majority of votes from across the city. The previous system prevented the minority population, which then tended to support Republican candidates, from being represented by candidates of their choice; apportionment under single-member districts meant that some districts in Nashville had Black majorities. In 1951, after passage of the new charter, African American attorneys [[Z. Alexander Looby]] and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council.<ref>Spinney 1998, p. 96</ref>

With the United States Supreme Court ruling in 1954 that public schools had to desegregate with "all deliberate speed", the family of student Robert Kelley filed a lawsuit in 1956, arguing that Nashville administrators should open all-White East High School to him. A similar case was filed by [[Reverend]] Henry Maxwell due to his children having to take a 45-minute bus ride from South Nashville to the north end of the city. These suits caused the courts to announce what became known as the "Nashville Plan", where the city's public schools would desegregate one grade per year beginning in the fall of 1957.<ref name=BitterSoutherner />

Urban redevelopment accelerated over the next several decades, and the city grew increasingly segregated. An interstate was placed on the edge of East Nashville while another highway was built through Edgehill, a lower-income, predominantly minority community.<ref name=BitterSoutherner />

===Postwar development to present===
Rapid [[suburb]]anization occurred during the years immediately after World War II, as new housing was being built outside city limits. This resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities, which the county found difficult to provide. At the same time, suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city, although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services that were supported financially only by city taxpayers. After years of discussion, a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government. It failed to gain approval although it was supported by the then-elected leaders of both jurisdictions, County Judge [[Beverly Briley]] and Mayor [[Ben West]].<ref name="bucy"/>

Following the referendum's failure, Nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base. This increased uncertainty among residents, and created resentment among many suburban communities. Under the second charter for metropolitan government, which was approved in 1962, two levels of service provision were proposed: the General Services District and the Urban Services District, to provide for a differential in tax levels. Residents of the Urban Services District had a full range of city services. The areas that made up the General Services District, however, had a lower tax rate until full services were provided.<ref name="bucy">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/Government/docs/MetroHistoryBucy.pdf |title=A Short History of the Creation of Metropolitan Government for Nashville-Davidson County |publisher=Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County |first=Carole |last=Bucy |date=2015}}</ref> This helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region.

In the early 1960s, Tennessee still had racial segregation of public facilities, including lunch counters and department store fitting rooms. Hotels and restaurants were also segregated. Between February 13 and May 10, 1960, [[Nashville sit-ins|a series of sit-ins]] were organized at lunch counters in downtown Nashville by the [[Nashville Student Movement]] and Nashville Christian Leadership Council, and were part of a broader [[sit-in movement]] in the southeastern United States as part of an effort to end racial segregation of public facilities.<ref>Houston 2012, p. 91-99</ref> On April 19, 1960, the house of Z.

In 1963, Nashville consolidated its government with Davidson County, forming a [[Consolidated city-county|metropolitan government]]. The membership on the Metro Council, the legislative body, was increased from 21 to 40 seats. Of these, five members are elected [[at-large]] and 35 are elected from [[single-member district]]s, each to serve a term of four years.<ref name="bucy"/> In 1957 Nashville desegregated its school system using an innovative grade a year plan, in response to a class action suit Kelly vs. Board of Education of Nashville.    By 1966 the Metro Council abandoned the grade a year plan and completely desegregated the entire school system at one time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historicnashvilleinc.org/|title=Historic Nashville {{!}} Keeping Nashville Unique Since 1968.|website=historicnashvilleinc.org|access-date=September 2, 2019}}</ref>

Congress passed civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965, but tensions continued as society was slow to change. On April 8, 1967, a riot broke out on the college campuses of Fisk University and Tennessee State University, [[historically black colleges and universities|historically Black colleges]], after [[Stokely Carmichael]] spoke about [[Black Power]] at [[Vanderbilt University]].<ref name="frizzellnotjustamatter">{{cite journal |last1=Frizzell |first1=Scott |title=Not Just a Matter of Black and White: The Nashville Riot of 1967 |journal=Tennessee Historical Quarterly |date=Spring 2011 |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=26–51 |jstor=42628733}}</ref> Although it was viewed as a "race riot", it had classist characteristics.<ref name="frizzellnotjustamatter"/>

Since the 1970s the city and county have undergone tremendous growth, particularly during the [[boom and bust|economic boom]] of the 1990s under the leadership of then-Mayor and later-[[List of governors of Tennessee|Tennessee Governor]], [[Phil Bredesen]]. Making urban renewal a priority, Bredesen fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]], the downtown [[Nashville Public Library]], the [[Bridgestone Arena]], and [[Nissan Stadium]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Ammenheuser |first=David |date=January 22, 2016 |title=Arena took downtown Nashville from eerie to epic |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/columnist/dave-ammenheuser/2016/01/22/arena-took-downtown-nashville-eerie-epic/77092054/ |work=The Tennessean |location=Nashville, TN |access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Allison |first=Natalie |date=October 27, 2018 |title=Phil Bredesen holds event celebrating 20 years of Titans, Predators in Nashville |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/tn-elections/2018/10/27/tennessee-elections-bredesen-holds-celebration-titans-predators-nissan-stadium/1763225002/ |work=The Tennessean |location=Nashville, TN |access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref>

Nissan Stadium (formerly Adelphia Coliseum and LP Field) was built after the [[National Football League]]'s (NFL) [[Houston Oilers]] agreed to move to the city in 1995. The NFL team debuted in Nashville in 1998 at [[Vanderbilt Stadium]], and Nissan Stadium opened in the summer of 1999.

Between May 1 and 7, 2010, much of Nashville was [[2010 Tennessee floods|extensively flooded as part of a series of 1,000 year floods]] throughout Middle and West Tennessee. Much of the flooding took place in areas along the Cumberland and [[Harpeth River|Harpeth]] Rivers and [[Mill Creek (Davidson County, Tennessee)|Mill Creek]], and caused extensive damage to the many buildings and structures in the city, including the Grand Ole Opry House, Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, Opry Mills Mall, Schermerhorn Symphony Center, Bridgestone Arena, and Nissan Stadium. Sections of Interstate 24 and Briley Parkway were also flooded. Eleven people died in the Nashville area as a result of the flooding, and damages were estimated to be over $2 billion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Grigsby|first=Karen|date=April 30, 2015|title=20 things to know about the 2010 Nashville flood|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2015/04/30/nashville-flood-20-things-to-know/26653901/|work=The Tennessean|location=Nashville, Tennessee|access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref>

Nashville's downtown area features a diverse assortment of entertainment, dining, cultural and architectural attractions. The Broadway and 2nd Avenue areas feature entertainment venues, night clubs and an assortment of restaurants. North of Broadway lie Nashville's central business district, Legislative Plaza, Capitol Hill and the [[Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park|Tennessee Bicentennial Mall]]. Cultural and architectural attractions can be found throughout the city.

Three major interstate highways (I-40, I-65 and I-24) converge near the core area of downtown, and many regional cities are within a day's driving distance.

Nashville's first skyscraper, the [[Life & Casualty Tower]], was completed in 1957 and launched the construction of other high rises in downtown Nashville. After the construction of the [[AT&T Building (Nashville)|AT&T Building]] (commonly referred to by locals as the "Batman Building") in 1994, the downtown area saw little construction until the mid-2000s.

Many civic and infrastructure projects are being planned, in progress, or recently completed. A new MTA bus hub was recently completed in downtown Nashville, as was the [[Music City Star]] pilot project. Several public parks have been constructed, such as the Public Square. Riverfront Park is scheduled to be extensively updated. The [[Music City Center]] opened in May 2013. It is a 1,200,000 square foot (110,000 m2) convention center with 370,000 square feet (34,000 m2) of exhibit space.

===Flora===
The nearby city of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]] is notable and even named for its so-called "cedar glades", which occur on soils too poor to support most trees and are instead dominated by [[Juniperus virginiana|Virginian juniper]]. [[Blackberry]] bushes, [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia pine]], [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pine]], [[Sassafras albidum|sassafras]], [[Acer rubrum|red maple]], [[Betula nigra|river birch]], [[Fagus grandifolia|American beech]], [[Arundinaria gigantea|river cane]], [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] and [[Platanus occidentalis|sycamore]] are all common native trees, along with many others.<ref>{{cite document |url=https://ag.tennessee.edu/tnyards/Documents/Native_Trees_for_Tennessee.pdf |title=Native Trees for Tennessee |publisher=The University of Tennessee, Agricultural Extension Service |first=Larry |last=Tankersley |date=July 1998}}</ref>

In addition to the native forests, the combination of hot summers, abundant rainfall and mild winters permit a wide variety of both temperate and subtropical plants to be cultivated easily. [[Magnolia grandiflora|Southern magnolia]] and cherry blossom trees are commonly cultivated here, with the city having an annual cherry blossom festival.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/2019/04/10/nashville-cherry-blossom-festival-chance-celebrate-friendship/3380269002/ |title=Nashville Cherry Blossom Festival is a chance to celebrate international friendship |work=The Tennessean |first=Hiroyuki |last=Kobayashi |date=April 9, 2019 |accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref> [[Lagerstroemia|Crepe myrtles]] and [[Taxus|yew]] bushes are also commonly grown throughout Metro Nashville, and the winters are mild enough that [[Magnolia virginiana|sweetbay magnolia]] is evergreen whenever it is cultivated. The [[pansy]] flower is popular to plant during the autumn, and some varieties will flower overwinter in Nashville's subtropical climate. However, many hot-weather plants like [[petunia]] and even [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]] thrive as annuals, and [[Musa basjoo|Japanese banana]] will die aboveground during winter but re-sprout after the danger of frost is over. Unbeknownst to most Tennesseans, even cold-hardy palms, particularly [[Rhapidophyllum|needle palm]] and [[Sabal minor|dwarf palmetto]], are grown uncommonly but often successfully. High desert plants like [[Picea pungens|Colorado spruce]] and [[Opuntia humifusa|prickly pear cactus]] are also grown somewhat commonly, as are ''[[Yucca filamentosa]]''.

Due to high yields available to investors, Nashville has been attracting a lot of capital from out-of-state. A key factor that has been attributed to the increase in investment is the adjustment to the city's zoning code. Developers can easily include a combination of residential, office, retail and entertainment space into their projects. Additionally, the city has invested heavily into public parks. Centennial Park is undergoing extensive renovations. The change in the zoning code and the investment in public space is consistent with the millennial generation's preference for walkable urban neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/realestate/commercial/nashvilles-skyline-being-rebuilt-by-building-boom.html |title=Nashville's Skyline Being Reshaped by Building Boom |work=The New York Times |last=Schneider |first=Keith |date=October 13, 2015 |accessdate=October 22, 2015}}</ref>

In September 2006, the [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] opened as the home of the [[Nashville Symphony]].

As the city's name itself is a [[metonymy|metonym]] for the country music industry, many popular attractions involve [[country music]], including the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]], [[Belcourt Theatre]], and [[Ryman Auditorium]].<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-15/in-booming-nashville-country-music-is-still-king</ref> Hence, the city became known as America's 'Country Music Capital.'<ref>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&objectid=12125246</ref><ref>https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/country-music-capital</ref><ref>https://www.travelalerts.ca/blogs/f-nashville-americas-country-music-capital/</ref>  The Ryman was home to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' until 1974 when the show moved to the Grand Ole Opry House, {{convert|9|mi}} east of downtown.

Each June, the [[CMA Music Festival]] (formerly known as Fan Fair) brings thousands of country fans to the city. The [[Tennessee State Fair]] is also held annually in September.

Nashville was once home of television shows such as ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[Pop! Goes the Country]]'', as well as [[The Nashville Network]] and later, [[RFD-TV]]. [[Country Music Television]] and [[Great American Country]] currently operate from Nashville. The city was also home to the [[Opryland USA|Opryland USA theme park]], which operated from 1972 to 1997 before being closed by its owners ([[Gaylord Entertainment Company]]) and soon after demolished to make room for the [[Opry Mills]] mega-shopping mall.

The [[Contemporary Christian music]] industry is based along Nashville's [[Music Row]], with a great influence in neighboring [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]]. The Christian record companies include [[EMI Christian Music Group]], [[Provident Label Group]] and [[Word Records]].

Music Row houses many [[gospel music]] and Contemporary Christian music companies centered around 16th and 17th Avenues South. On River Road, off Charlotte Pike in West Nashville, the ''CabaRay'' opened its doors on January 18, 2018. The performing venue of [[Ray Stevens]] it offers a [[Vegas]]-style dinner and a show atmosphere. There is also a [[piano bar]] and a [[gift shop]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://raystevenscabaray.com/ |title=Ray Stevens CabaRay Showroom}}</ref>

Although Nashville was never known as a major [[jazz]] town, it did have many great jazz bands, including The Nashville Jazz Machine led by Dave Converse and its current version, the Nashville Jazz Orchestra, led by Jim Williamson, as well as The Establishment, led by Billy Adair. The Francis Craig Orchestra entertained Nashvillians from 1929 to 1945 from the Oak Bar and Grille Room in the [[Hermitage Hotel]]. Craig's orchestra was also the first to broadcast over local radio station WSM-AM and enjoyed phenomenal success with a 12-year show on the [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] Network. In the late 1930s, he introduced a newcomer, [[Dinah Shore]], a local graduate of Hume Fogg High School and Vanderbilt University.

Radio station [[WMOT|WMOT-FM]] in nearby [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], which formerly programmed jazz almost exclusively and still does so on the weekends, aided significantly in the recent revival of the city's jazz scene, as has the non-profit Nashville Jazz Workshop, which holds concerts and classes in a renovated building in the north Nashville neighborhood of Germantown. [[Fisk University]] also maintains a jazz station, [[WFSK]].

Nashville has an active theatre scene and is home to several professional and community theatre companies.

The city of Nashville and Davidson County merged in 1963 as a way for Nashville to combat the problems of [[urban sprawl]]. The combined entity is officially known as "the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County", and is popularly known as "Metro Nashville" or simply "Metro". It offers services such as [[Metropolitan Nashville Police Department|police]], [[Nashville Fire Department|fire]], [[Nashville Electric Service|electricity]], water and sewage treatment. When the Metro government was formed in 1963, the government was split into two service districts—the "urban services district" and the "general services district." The urban services district encompasses the 1963 boundaries of the former City of Nashville, approximately {{convert|72|sqmi}},<ref name="citypap20101121">{{cite news |url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/metros-two-tiered-revenue-system-raises-taxing-questions |title=Metro's two-tiered revenue system raises taxing questions |work=[[The City Paper]] |first=Charles |last=Maldonado |date=November 21, 2010 |accessdate=February 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205195634/http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/metros-two-tiered-revenue-system-raises-taxing-questions |archive-date=February 5, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and the general services district includes the remainder of Davidson County.

These municipalities use a two-tier system of government, with the smaller municipality typically providing police services and the Metro Nashville government providing most other services. Previously, the city of [[Lakewood, Tennessee|Lakewood]] also had a separate charter. However, Lakewood residents voted in 2010 and 2011 to dissolve its city charter and join the metropolitan government, with both votes passing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14258754/residents-vote-to-surrender-lakewoods-charter |title=Residents Vote To Surrender Lakewood's Charter |work=NewsChannel5.com |first=Andy |last=Humbles |date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320024943/http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14258754/residents-vote-to-surrender-lakewoods-charter |archive-date=March 20, 2011}}</ref>

===Politics===
<!--Hold place for image of David Briley when available-->

Nashville has been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold since at least the end of [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]], and has remained staunchly Democratic even as the state as a whole has trended strongly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Pockets of Republican influence exist in the wealthier portions of the city, but they are usually no match for the overwhelming Democratic trend in the rest of the city. The issue of school busing roiled politics for years but subsided after the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxWf4Yup1twC |title=The Burden of Busing: The Politics of Desegregation in Nashville, Tennessee |publisher=The University of Tennessee Press |first1=Richard A. |last1=Pride |first2=J. David |last2=Woodward |date=1985 |isbn=0-87049-474-0}}</ref> While local elections are officially nonpartisan, nearly all the city's elected officials are publicly known as Democrats. The city is split among 10 state house districts, all of which are held by Democrats. Three state senate districts and part of a fourth are within the county; two are held by Democrats and two by Republicans.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Tennessee: A Maturing Two-Party System |journal=American Review of Politics |first1=John M. |last1=Bruce |first2=John A. |last2=Clark |first3=Michael M. |last3=Gant |first4=Linda M. |last4=Daugherty |volume=24 |pages=165–182 |date=2003 |doi=10.15763/issn.2374-7781.2003.24.0.165-182|doi-access=free }}</ref>

In the state legislature, Nashville politicians serve as leaders of both the [[Tennessee Senate|Senate]] and [[Tennessee House of Representatives|House]] Democratic Caucuses. Representative Mike Stewart serves as Chairman of the House Caucus. Senator [[Jeff Yarbro]] serves as Chairman of the Senate Caucus.

Democrats are no less dominant at the federal level. Democratic presidential candidates have failed to carry Davidson County only five times since reconstruction; in 1928, 1968, 1972, 1984 and 1988.<ref name="uselectionatlas.org">[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential Atlas (Maps for Indiana by election)] Results prior to 1960 available through subscription only</ref> In most years, Democrats have carried Nashville at the presidential level with relatively little difficulty, even in years when they lose Tennessee as a whole. This has been especially true in recent elections. In the 2000 presidential election, Tennessean Democrat [[Al Gore]] carried Nashville with over 59% of the vote even as he narrowly lost his home state. In the 2004 election, Democrat [[John Kerry]] carried Nashville with 55% of the vote even as [[George W. Bush]] won the state by 14 points. In 2008, [[Barack Obama]] carried Nashville with 60% of the vote even as Republican [[John McCain]] won Tennessee by 15 points.

Despite its large size, Nashville has been in a single congressional district for most of the time since Reconstruction; it is currently the [[Tennessee's 5th congressional district|5th District]], represented by Democrat [[Jim Cooper]], who is also the brother of Nashville's current mayor John Cooper.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Kyle |date=September 27, 2019 |title=John Cooper Sworn in as Nashville Mayor |url=https://www.wsmv.com/news/john-cooper-inauguration-ceremony-saturday/article_6134d766-e191-11e9-af87-af513f7b3103.html |work=WSMV Nashville |language=en|accessdate=September 28, 2019}}</ref> A Republican has not represented a significant portion of Nashville since 1874. Republicans made a few spirited challenges in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. The Republicans almost won it in 1968; only a strong showing by a candidate from Wallace's [[American Independent Party]] kept the seat in Democratic hands. However, they have not made a serious bid for the district since 1972, when the Republican candidate gained only 38% of the vote even as Nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin. The district's best-known congressman was probably [[Joseph W. Byrns Sr.|Jo Byrns]], who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and was [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] for much of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]'s first term as President. Another nationally prominent congressman from Nashville was [[Percy Priest]], who represented the district from 1941 to 1956 and was [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] from 1949 to 1953. Former mayors [[Richard Fulton]] and [[Bill Boner]] also sat in the U.S. House before assuming the Metro mayoral office.

From 2003 to 2013, a sliver of southwestern Nashville was located in the [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district|7th District]], represented by Republican [[Marsha Blackburn]]. This area was roughly coextensive with the portion of Nashville she had represented in the state senate from 1998 to 2002. However, the 5th regained all of Nashville after the 2010 census.

I-40 connects the city between [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to the west and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to the east, I-24 connects between [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] to the northwest and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] to the southeast, and I-65 connects between [[Louisville, Kentucky]] to the north and [[Huntsville, Alabama]] to the south. All three of these interstate highways, which also serve the suburbs, form brief [[concurrency (road)|concurrencies]] with each other in the city, and completely encircle downtown. [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|Interstate 440]] is a bypass route connecting I-40, I-65, and I-24 south of downtown Nashville. [[Tennessee State Route 155|Briley Parkway]], the majority of which is a [[controlled access highway|freeway]], forms a bypass around the north side of the city and its interstates. Ellington Parkway, a freeway made up of a section of [[U.S. Route 31E in Tennessee|U.S. Route 31E]], runs between east of downtown and Briley Parkway, serving as an alternative route to I-65. [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]] provides an outer southern bypass for the city and its suburbs. [[United States Numbered Highway System|U.S. Routes]] [[U.S. Route 31 in Tennessee|31]], 31E, [[U.S. Route 31W in Tennessee|31W]], [[U.S. Route 31A|31 Alternate]], [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|41]], [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee–Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41 Alternate]], [[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|70]], [[U.S. Route 70S|70S]], and [[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] also serve Nashville, intersecting in the city's center as arterial surface roads and radiating outward. Most of these routes are called "pikes" and many carry the names of nearby towns to which they lead. Among these are Clarksville Pike, Gallatin Pike, Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro Pike, Nolensville Pike, and Franklin Pike.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Davidson County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/a-g/Davidson%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref>

====Public transit====
The [[Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority|Metropolitan Transit Authority]] provides bus transit within the city. Routes utilize a [[spoke–hub distribution paradigm|hub and spoke]] method, centered around the Music City Central transit station in downtown.<ref name="tenn20141008">{{cite news |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/davidson/2014/10/08/getting-around/16929479/ |title=Getting around |work=The Tennessean |date=October 8, 2014 |accessdate=May 7, 2018}}</ref> A rejected [[Let's Move Nashville|expansion plan]] included use of [[bus rapid transit]] and [[light rail]] service at some point in the future.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nashville voters overwhelmingly reject transit referendum |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/01/nashville-transit-vote-davidson-county-mass-transit/564991002/ |work=The Tennessean |last=Garrison |first=Joey |date=May 2, 2018 |accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref>

Nashville is considered a gateway city for rail and air traffic for the [[Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cqgrd.gatech.edu/program_areas/megaregions/pam.php |title=Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion (PAM) |work=GATech.edu |year=2009 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719200447/http://www.cqgrd.gatech.edu/program_areas/megaregions/pam.php |archive-date=July 19, 2011 }}</ref>

====Air====
[[File:Nashville International Airport restaurants.jpg|thumb|Interior of the terminal at the Nashville International Airport]]
The city is served by [[Nashville International Airport]] (BNA), which is operated by the [[Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority]] (MNAA). 18.27 million passengers visited the airport in 2019, making it the 31st busiest airport in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flynashville.com/about/Airport%20Data//122019TotalPassengers.pdf |title=Total Passengers |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref> BNA is ranked fastest growing airport among the top 50 airports in the United States. Nashville International Airport serves 600 daily flights to more than 85 nonstop markets.

In late 2014, BNA became the first major U.S. airport to establish dedicated pick-up and drop-off areas for [[vehicle for hire]] companies.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/money/2014/09/25/nashville-airport-bna-uber-lyft-ride-sharing/16209319/ | title=Nashville airport first in U.S. to allow Uber, Lyft | work=[[The Tennessean]] | first=Jamie | last=McGee | date=September 25, 2014}}</ref>

The airport authority also operates the [[John C. Tune Airport]], a [[Class E airspace]] [[general aviation]] airport.

====Intercity rail====
[[File:Music City Star.jpg|thumb|A [[Music City Star]] commuter train beneath the [[Shelby Street Bridge]]]]
Although a major freight hub for [[CSX Transportation]], Nashville is not currently served by [[Amtrak]], the [[List of major cities in U.S. lacking inter-city rail service|third-largest metropolitan area]] in the U.S. to have this distinction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.narprail.org/resources/fact-sheets/2056-msaservice |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227131656/http://www.narprail.org/resources/fact-sheets/2056-msaservice |archive-date=December 27, 2013 }}</ref> Nashville's [[Union Station (Nashville)|Union Station]] had once been a major intercity passenger rail center for the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]]; [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway]]; and the [[Tennessee Central Railway]], reaching Midwestern cities and cities on the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. However, by the time of Amtrak's founding, service had been cut back to a single train, the ''[[Floridian (train)|Floridian]]'', which ran from [[Chicago]] to [[Miami]] and [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. It served Union Station until its cancellation on October 9, 1979, due to poor track conditions resulting in late trains and low ridership, ending over 120 years of intercity rail service in Nashville.

While there have been few proposals to restore Amtrak service to Nashville, there have been repeated calls from residents.<ref name=amtrak>{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Howard |title=Fans of rail want Amtrak here; Nashville not ready to support train service, state says |work=[[The Tennessean]] |date=July 2, 2007 |url=http://reporterkatehoward.blogspot.com/2007/07/tennessean-7207-fans-of-rail-want.html |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref> In addition to scarce federal funding, Tennessee state officials do not believe that Nashville is large enough to support intercity rail. "It would be wonderful to say I can be in Memphis and jump on a train to Nashville, but the volume of people who would do that isn't anywhere close to what the cost would be to provide the service," said Ed Cole, chief of environment and planning with the Tennessee Department of Transportation.<ref name=amtrak/> Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, said rail trips would catch on if routes were expanded, but conceded that it would be nearly impossible to resume Amtrak service to Nashville without a substantial investment from the state.<ref name=amtrak/> However, in 2020, Amtrak indicated it was considering a service that would run from Atlanta to Nashville by way of Chattanooga.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newschannel5.com/news/amtrak-pitches-passenger-train-from-nashville-to-atlanta|title=Amtrak pitches passenger train from Nashville to Atlanta|date=January 17, 2020|website=WTVF|language=en|access-date=February 6, 2020}}</ref>

Nashville launched a passenger commuter rail system called the [[Music City Star]] on September 18, 2006. The only currently operational leg of the system connects the city of Lebanon to downtown Nashville at the [[Nashville Riverfront station]]. Legs to Clarksville, Murfreesboro and Gallatin are currently in the feasibility study stage. The system plan includes seven legs connecting Nashville to surrounding suburbs.
