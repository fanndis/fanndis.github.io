==Early life==
Benjamin was born in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the only child of Sharon Benjamin-Hodo (d. 2013), a [[Single parent|single mother]] who sold real estate, and Lawrence Harvey Walker (d. 2014), a collections agent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Li-Ou/OutKast.html |title=OutKast Biography – family, parents, name, story, school, mother, son, old, information, born, college |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005791,00.html | work=Time | title=Music: Dysfunktion Junction | date=September 29, 2003 | access-date=April 23, 2010 | first=Josh | last=Tyrangiel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/atlanta/obituary.aspx?n=lawrence-walker&pid=169667157&fhid=5036|title=Lawrence WALKER's Obituary on Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}</ref> Growing up in Atlanta, [[East Point, Georgia|East Point]], and [[Bankhead, Atlanta|Bankhead, Georgia]], Benjamin attended Sarah Smith Elementary School, Sutton Middle School, Northside High School, and [[Tri-Cities High School]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Blau |first=Max |url=http://clatl.com/atlanta/dungeon-family-tree/Content?oid=1243687 |title=Dungeon Family tree &#124; Cover Story &#124; Creative Loafing Atlanta |publisher=Clatl.com |date=September 18, 2003 |access-date=2013-10-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005909/http://clatl.com/atlanta/dungeon-family-tree/Content?oid=1243687 |archive-date=October 5, 2013 }}</ref>

==Music career==
===Outkast: 1992–2007===
In high school, Benjamin (who was then performing as André) met Antwan "[[Big Boi]]" Patton. Benjamin and Patton teamed up to form Outkast. Shortly after graduating, Outkast was signed to the Atlanta-based [[LaFace]] label and released their debut album, ''[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]'', in 1994. Buoyed by the success of the single "Player's Ball", the album went [[platinum record|platinum]] by the end of the year and Outkast was named Best New Rap Group of the Year at the 1995 [[Source Awards]].

On their next two albums, ''[[ATLiens]]'' (1996) and ''[[Aquemini]]'' (1998), Outkast experimented with their sound by adding elements of [[trip hop]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]]. The albums were also influenced by a return to traditional black music genres, with [[funk music|funk]] being the most prominent example. Outkast's style and lyricism again received commercial and critical acclaim. With the duo's portrayal of themselves as out-of-place extraterrestrials in ''ATLiens'', Benjamin's lyrics, in particular, were noted for their [[surrealism|surreal]], space-age tinge: "the funkadelic, futuristic, and seemingly unfamiliar, weird, or eccentric persona projected by André 3000 creates the chance to transcend the more pronounced characterizations of gangstas and pimps so regularly assumed by black men rap artists."<ref>Beyond Keeping It Real: Outkast, the Funk Connection, and Afrofuturism, Howard Rabsy II, American Studies, Volume 52, Number 4, 2013, pp. 205–216</ref> During the recording of these albums, Benjamin took up guitar, painting, and a relationship with singer [[Erykah Badu]].

Outkast's fourth album, ''[[Stankonia]]'' (2000), introduced Benjamin's new alias André 3000 (largely to distinguish himself from [[Dr. Dre]] and his new persona after his split with Badu) and increased the group's crossover appeal with the single "[[Ms. Jackson]]", which hit #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song was written in the aftermath of Benjamin's breakup with Badu and was a fictionalized account of the disintegration of their relationship. In 2002, Outkast released a greatest hits album, ''[[Big Boi and Dre Present... OutKast]]'', which contained three new tracks, one of which, "[[The Whole World]]", won a [[Grammy]] for [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]]. Later that year, Benjamin participated in the [[Dungeon Family]] group album, which saw some prominent Atlanta-based hip-hop groups combine into a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]. In 2002, André 3000 was referenced on the song "[[Till I Collapse]]" by [[Eminem]], who considered him one of the best rappers ever.

In 2003, Outkast released ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', a double album that highlighted the differences in the musical styles of the group's two members. Though Big Boi's half of the album, ''Speakerboxxx'', spawned the number-one hit "[[The Way You Move]]" and the relatively successful "Ghetto Musick", Benjamin's ''The Love Below'' garnered the most attention from mainstream audiences, with the popular singles "[[Hey Ya!]]" and "[[Roses (Outkast song)|Roses]]" and their [[music video]]s receiving heavy radio and television airtime. "Prototype", the album's fourth single and video (Benjamin's third), was released shortly after. Unlike ''Speakerboxxx'', ''The Love Below'' is an exercise in funk, [[jazz]], and [[alternative rock|alternative]] music, featuring vocals from Benjamin which are mostly sung instead of rapped. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' compared Benjamin to "an [[indie-rock]] [[Little Richard]]" on "Hey Ya!" and later declared the international hit one of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/outkast/albums/album/290754/review/6068251/speakerboxxxthe_love_below] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525091116/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/Outkast/albums/album/290754/review/6068251/speakerboxxxthe_love_below|date=May 25, 2009}}</ref>
[[file:André3000.jpg|thumb|upright|André 3000 in January 2006]]
In 2006, Outkast released their sixth album as a group, ''[[Idlewild (Outkast album)|Idlewild]]'', which also served as a soundtrack to the group's musical film ''[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]''. The film depicts life in a 1930s setting and the album takes influences from the music of that era, particularly [[blues music|blues]]. Benjamin had a few rapped verses on the album, including on the first single "[[Mighty O]]", but mostly stuck with singing, as he had on ''The Love Below''. The album postponed the release of the theatrical film, as Benjamin and Patton were concentrated more on the production of the music than the movie. In an interview with ''Billboard'' in 2006, Benjamin explained that Outkast and its associates had developed the idea of creating a movie before the release of ''Aquemini'', so that when it finally came time to collaborate on the movie, they already had most of the details worked out, including a script, and the movie was ultimately finished before the album was.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Kasting a Wide Net|last = Conniff|first = Tamara|date = July 22, 2006|journal = Billboard - the International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment}}</ref>

In January 2014, it was announced that Outkast would be reuniting to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide during the spring/summer of 2014, beginning with a headline spot at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in [[Indio, California]] in April.

===Solo work: 2007–present===
Benjamin returned to rapping in 2007, after a hiatus from the genre, appearing on various [[remix]]es including "[[Walk It Out (Unk song)|Walk It Out]]", "[[Throw Some D's]]", "[[You (Lloyd Song)|You]]", and [[Jay-Z]]'s "30 Something". His contributions to original songs included [[UGK]]'s "International Players Anthem", [[Devin the Dude]]'s "[[What a Job]]", [[Fonzworth Bentley]]'s "Everybody", and Big Boi's "[[Royal Flush (song)|Royal Flush]]" alongside [[Raekwon]]. Benjamin also worked with [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] in the song "BE BRAVE", which was supposed to be released on Q-Tip's 2008 album ''[[The Renaissance (Q-Tip album)|The Renaissance]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=VOZICK-LEVINSON|first1=S.|title=ON THE Q-TIP|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=Sep 7, 2007}}</ref> He also appeared on the track "[[Green Light (John Legend song)|Green Light]]" from [[John Legend]]'s album ''[[Evolver (John Legend album)|Evolver]]'', which was released on October 28, 2008. Prior to the release, Benjamin commented: "It's going to be a surprise for a lot of John Legend fans because it is a lot more upbeat than John is—than people think John is. I was actually happy to hear it. This is a cool John Legend song." Benjamin has stated that he plans on recording a solo rap album and that the response to his remixes is part of the motivation for it.<ref>[http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/07/11/andre-3000-reveals-a-solo-album-is-on-the-way/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231191233/http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/07/11/andre-3000-reveals-a-solo-album-is-on-the-way/|date=December 31, 2007}}</ref> In 2010, he was featured on [[Ciara]]'s remix for her single "[[Ride (Ciara song)|Ride]]" from the album ''[[Basic Instinct (album)|Basic Instinct]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/06/11/new-music-ciara-f-andre-3000-bei-maejor-ride-remix/ |title=New Music: Ciara f/ André 3000 & Bei Maejor – 'Ride (Remix)' |publisher=Rap-Up.com |access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref> and on the remix to&nbsp;[[Chris Brown]]'s "[[Deuces (song)|Deuces]]".

On June 24, 2011, [[Beyoncé]]'s fourth studio album, entitled&nbsp;''[[4 (Beyoncé Knowles album)|4]]'', was released. Benjamin featured on the track "Party", his first collaboration with the singer. The song was later nominated for the Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the [[2012 Grammy Awards]]. Benjamin continued his string of guest appearances throughout the year, featuring on Lloyd's song "[[Dedication to My Ex (Miss That)]]", Lil Wayne's "Interlude", and [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]'s "The Real Her". He also featured on the track "[[Play the Guitar]]" by [[B.o.B]].

==Personal life==
Benjamin is a childhood friend of [[Fonzworth Bentley]]. He also has a son named Seven Sirius Benjamin (born November 18, 1997) with singer [[Erykah Badu]].

In 2004, alongside [[Alicia Silverstone]], Benjamin was voted by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) as the "World's Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity".<ref name="virginmedia.com"/> Benjamin was a [[vegan]]<ref>Polly Vernon, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/18/popandrock.outkast "'I'm addicted to creating'"], ''The Guardian'', September 18, 2005.</ref> for fifteen years. By 2014, he had given it up, stating:

{{quote|I was a hardcore vegan for fifteen years. I've even done raw. But socially it became horrible. I was kind of just sitting at home eating a salad. You become mean. That's not good for you.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/interviews/a29718/andre-3000-interview-0914/ |title=André 3000: What I've Learned' |publisher=Esquire |date=August 27, 2014}}</ref>|}}

Benjamin posed for a print advertising campaign by [[Declare Yourself]], a campaign encouraging voter registration among youth for the [[2008 United States presidential election]]. In the ads by photographer [[David LaChapelle]], he has his mouth gagged by a bow-tie in a symbolic function.<ref>[http://www.declareyourself.com/multimedia/gallery_197.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913213124/http://www.declareyourself.com/multimedia/gallery_197.html|date=September 13, 2008}}</ref>
