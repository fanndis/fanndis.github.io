Since 2018, the '''Paris Peace Forum''' has been the place where heads of State and international organizations meet civil society and the private sector to construct new forms of collective action. It gathers annually dozens of heads of States and Governments, heads of [[International organization|International Organizations]], leaders from the [[civil society]] and the private sector, as well as thousands of individuals from all around the globe. The Paris Peace Forum complete the existing world agenda of multilateral gatherings by creating a specific event for [[global governance]] issues, as economic and financial issues are dealt at the [[World Economic Forum]] of Davos, and security issues at the [[Munich Security Conference]].

The Forum's DNA is to be an inclusive, solution-oriented gathering : with this in mind, the Forum showcases each year more than 100 projects coming from all around the world which display concrete and efficient solutions to governance challenges.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Call for projects 2020|url=https://parispeaceforum.org/call-for-projects/|access-date=2020-09-01|website=Paris Peace Forum|language=en-US}}</ref> It mostly focus on concrete initiatives and has been used as a platform for the launch of important, multi-actor initiatives, such as the B4IG coalition<ref>{{Cite web|title=From G7 announcement in August to Paris Peace Forum, Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition gains momentum - OECD|url=https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/from-g7-announcement-in-august-to-paris-peace-forum-business-for-inclusive-growth-b4ig-coalition-gains-momentum.htm|access-date=2020-09-22|website=www.oecd.org}}</ref> or the Paris Call for Trust and Security in the Cyberspace.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-11-12|title=Paris Call: Growing Consensus on Cyberspace|url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/11/12/paris-call-consensus-cyberspace/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=Microsoft on the Issues|language=en-US}}</ref>

The Paris Peace Forum was founded in 2018 by [[Justin Vaïsse]], as he was Director for Policy Planning at the [[Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs|French ministry for Europe and foreign Affairs]], to tackle global problems and strengthen multilateral cooperation.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-11-13|title=Can Macron's 'Davos for democracy' make a difference?|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20181113-can-macrons-davos-democracy-make-difference|access-date=2020-09-01|website=France 24|language=en}}</ref> Soon after the first edition, [[Pascal Lamy]] was appointed President of the Paris Peace Forum, and [[Justin Vaïsse]] became its Director General.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-02-20|title=Preparing Paris Peace Forum 2019: A new leadership for the second edition|url=https://parispeaceforum.org/2019/02/20/preparing-paris-peace-forum-2019-a-new-leadership-for-the-second-edition/|access-date=2020-09-01|website=Paris Peace Forum|language=en-US}}</ref> On 11-13 November 2020, its third edition will be chiefly devoted to the multi-actor response to Coronavirus, with the conviction that all relevant actors can collectively overcome the enormous challenges faced by the international community and use the crisis as an opportunity to rebuild a more sustainable world.<ref>{{Cite web|last=étrangères|first=Ministère de l'Europe et des Affaires|title=The third Paris Peace Forum: building a better world after the pandemic|url=https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/civil-society/news/article/the-third-paris-peace-forum-building-a-better-world-after-the-pandemic|access-date=2020-09-01|website=France Diplomacy - Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs|language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
The Paris Peace Forum was born out of the principle that “a badly governed world would quickly become a world at war”,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/monde/enjeux-internationaux/premier-forum-pour-la-paix-a-paris-146401|title=Premier forum pour la paix à Paris|date=2018-11-09|website=Les Echos|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> as explained by Justin Vaïsse, then president of the Forum. At the Meeting of [[Ambassador]]s on 29 August 2017, French [[Emmanuel Macron|President Emmanuel Macron]] spoke of the fact that peace is not something to be taken for granted, mentioning the [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian crisis]] and the [[Ukrainian crisis]] as examples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2017/08/29/discours-du-president-de-la-republique-a-l-ouverture-de-la-conference-des-ambassadeurs|title=Discours du Président de la République à l'ouverture de la conférence des Ambassadeurs|website=elysee.fr|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> In light of such developments, he called for the need to take concrete steps to strengthen multilateralism and preserve peace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2017/08/29/discours-du-president-de-la-republique-a-l-ouverture-de-la-conference-des-ambassadeurs|title=Discours du Président de la République à l'ouverture de la conférence des Ambassadeurs|website=elysee.fr|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> President Macron then announced the creation of the Paris Peace Forum on 4 January 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1ET21Q-OFRTP|title=Macron annonce un forum pour conjurer les périls mondiaux|date=2018-01-04|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-08-08|language=fr}}</ref>

=== First edition : 2018 ===
The first edition of the Paris Peace Forum took place on 11–13 November 2018, and was attended by 65 Heads of States and Governments.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-11-14|title=Bringing together global governance actors for 3 days: a major challenge successfully met|url=https://parispeaceforum.org/2018/11/14/bringing-together-global-governance-actors-for-3-days-a-major-challenge-successfully-met/|access-date=2019-08-08|website=Paris Peace Forum|language=en-US}}</ref> It showcased 120 global governance projects and welcomed 6000 individuals over the 3 days. Among the attendees were Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] and 2018 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Nadia Murad]]. German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[António Guterres]], joined President [[Emmanuel Macron]] in each making an opening remark at the beginning of the Forum. UN Secetary General [[António Guterres|Guterres]] drew parallels between the political atmosphere then and the pre-[[World War I]] period and the ‘30s [[Interwar period]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-11-11|title=Forum sur la paix.

The commemoration of [[Armistice Day|Armistice day]] was a recurring theme throughout the Forum. President Macron aimed for the Forum to bring about concrete proposals for multilateralism so that an outcome akin to WWI would not replicate again.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Paris Peace Forum opens on Centenary Armistice Day|url=https://centenarynews.com/article/paris-peace-forum-opens-on-centenary-armistice-day|access-date=2019-08-08|website=centenarynews.com|language=en}}</ref> It was noted multiple times that the importance of remembering the Armistice stood in the comparisons that could be drawn between the 1930s and today. Similarly to the statements made by UN Secretary General Guterres, Justin Vaïsse also highlighted the similarities, including: an [[Financial crisis|economic crisis]], closing of borders, commercial wars, [[Human migration|migration]] and [[refugee]]s, and a resurgence of populist and nationalist movements.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2018-11-05|title=Justin Vaïsse : « Des résonances troublantes avec les années 1930 »|language=fr|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/centenaire-14-18/article/2018/11/05/justin-vaisse-des-resonances-troublantes-avec-les-annees-1930_5379004_3448834.html|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>

=== Second edition : 2019 ===
The second edition of the Paris Peace Forum took place on 11–13 November at la [[Grande halle de la Villette|Grande Halle de La Villette]], under the presidency of [[Pascal Lamy]], who was previously President of the Steering Committee, and with [[Justin Vaïsse]] as the Forum's Director General. The Paris Peace Forum 2019 was attended by 7,000 participants, representing 164 nationalities. 33 Heads of State and Government were present, with official delegations from 140 countries. 318 project leaders representing 114 governance solutions from around the world gathered in the Forum's Space for Solutions.

Secretary General of the [[United Nations]], [[António Guterres]], Mayor of [[Paris]], [[Anne Hidalgo]], and President of the Paris Peace Forum, [[Pascal Lamy]], spoke during the event's soft opening on 11 November. UN Secretary general Guterres evoked the main global challenges of our times, by distinguishing five global risks: an economic and geostrategic polarization, a crack of the social contract caused by rising inequalities and protests, the loss of solidarity between communities and the rise of hate as a political tool, environmental degradation and the [[climate crisis]], and finally, the risk of unchecked technology. The official opening ceremony took place on 12 November. Opening remarks were made by President of the [[France|French Republic]], [[Emmanuel Macron]], the President-Elect of the [[European Commission]], [[Ursula von der Leyen|Ursula Von der Leyen]], President of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Félix Tshisekedi]] and the Vice-President of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], [[Wang Qishan]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=BFMTV|title=Paris: Macron, von der Leyen et Tshisekedi têtes d'affiche ce mardi au Forum sur la Paix|url=https://www.bfmtv.com/actualite/parismacron-von-der-leyen-et-tshisekedi-tetes-d-affiche-ce-mardi-au-forum-sur-la-paix-1804446.html|access-date=2019-11-21|website=BFMTV|language=fr}}</ref>.

For this second edition, last year's Peace Library, which gathered books gifted by high-level participants, took the form of a Peace Globe, where world leaders were given the opportunity to leave objects symbolizing peace in.

== Philosophy ==
The purpose of the Forum would be to commemorate the 100th anniversary of [[Armistice Day]], as well as to “reflect together, propose concrete initiatives, reinvent multilateralism and all forms of contemporary cooperation”.<ref>{{Citation|title=Forum de Paris sur la Paix : rendez-vous le 11 novembre 2018 {{!}} Emmanuel Macron|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tc4N8hhdpA|language=en|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> President Macron and then-president Justin Vaïsse aimed at bringing together global governance actors, in an international and open space, in order to interact, discuss and generate concrete solutions. An important aspect of the Forum is the showcasing of 100+ projects from around the world. Each of these projects proposes an innovative solution to a specific issue. The projects present in 6 of the following categories:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://parispeaceforum.org/fr/projets-selectionnes-en-2019/|title=Projets sélectionnés en 2019|website=Paris Peace Forum|language=fr-FR|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>

By the third day of the Forum, 10 projects are selected as Scale-Up projects to receive mentorship and support from the Paris Peace Forum for a one-year period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/monde/enjeux-internationaux/premier-forum-pour-la-paix-a-paris-146401|title=Premier forum pour la paix à Paris|date=2018-11-09|website=Les Echos|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>

Although initiated by the French President, the Forum remains independent in its scope and funding. The event is financed by non-governmental partners, each of which cannot cover more than 10% of the costs.

== Criticisms ==
The Paris Peace Forum faced criticism for having extended an invitation to [[Saudi Arabia]], in light of journalist [[Jamal Khashoggi]]’s murder and the continuing [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|war in Yemen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tf1.fr/tmc/quotidien-avec-yann-barthes/videos/arabie-saoudite-purge-precedent-sommet.html|title=Arabie Saoudite : Purge sans précédent au sommet|website=MYTF1|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> Due to similar such contradictions, such as France's involvement in weapons sales, and nuclear armament, questions were raised as to the extent to which the peace summit was truly substantial or just an instrument of communication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/le-11-novembre-2018-un-rendez-vous-manque-pour-la-paix-663479|title=Le 11 novembre 2018, un rendez-vous manqué pour la paix ?|date=2018-11-12|website=L'Humanité|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.mediapart.fr/andre-bellon/blog/071118/la-paix-enjeu-d-interet-public-ou-instrument-tactique|title=La paix, enjeu d’intérêt public ou instrument tactique ?|last=Bellon|first=André|website=Club de Mediapart|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>

Criticism was also drawn to the event's funding, with contributions made, among others, by tech giants such as [[Google]] and Microsoft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/diplomatie-macron-invente-la-paix-made-gafam-663467|title=Diplomatie.

Some also argued that the Forum was homogenous in its discussion, reserved for the elites who agreed with each other rather than including those who disagreed with multilateralism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/brent-patterson/2018/11/paris-peace-forum-underscores-epic-clash-economic-narratives|title=The Paris Peace Forum underscores an epic clash of economic narratives {{!}} rabble.ca|website=rabble.ca|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>
