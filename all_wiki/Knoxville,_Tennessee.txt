===Early history===
The first people to form substantial settlements in what is now Knoxville were indigenous people who arrived during the [[Woodland period]] (c. 1000&nbsp;B.C. – A.D 1000).<ref name="Fletcher Jolly III 1976">Fletcher Jolly III, "40KN37: An Early Woodland Habitation Site in Knox County, Tennessee", ''Tennessee Archaeologist'' 31, nos. 1–2 (1976), 51.</ref> One of the oldest artificial structures in Knoxville is a burial mound constructed during the early [[Mississippian culture]] period (c. A.D. 1000-1400). The earthwork mound has been preserved, but the campus of the University of Tennessee developed around it.<ref>Frank H. McClung Museum, "[http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/permanent/native/woodland.shtml Woodland Period] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412122905/http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/permanent/native/woodland.shtml |date=April 12, 2012 }}."  Retrieved: March 25, 2008.</ref>

Other prehistoric sites include an Early Woodland habitation area at the confluence of the Tennessee River and Knob Creek (near the Knox-Blount county line),<ref name="Fletcher Jolly III 1976"/> and [[Dallas Phase]] Mississippian villages at Post Oak Island (also along the river near the Knox-Blount line),<ref>James Strange, "An Unusual Late Prehistoric Pipe from Post Oak Island (40KN23)", ''Tennessee Archaeologist'' 30, no. 1 (1974), 80.</ref> and at [[Bussell Island]] (at the mouth of the [[Little Tennessee River]] near Lenoir City).<ref>Richard Polhemus, ''The Toqua Site—40MR6'', Vol. I (Norris, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1987), 1240-1246.</ref>

By the 18th century, the [[Cherokee]], an [[Iroquoian language]] people, had become the dominant tribe in the East Tennessee region; they are believed to have migrated centuries before from the Great Lakes area. They were consistently at war with the [[Creek tribe|Creek]] (who spoke [[Muscogee language|Muskogee]]) and [[Shawnee]] (who spoke Central [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]).<ref>Cora Tula Watters, "Shawnee."  ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 278-279.</ref><ref>Ima Stephens, "Creek", ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 252-253.</ref>  The Cherokee people called the Knoxville area ''kuwanda'talun'yi'', which means "Mulberry Place."<ref>[[James Mooney]], ''Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee'' (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972 - reprint from 1891 and 1900), 526.</ref>  Most Cherokee habitation in the area was concentrated in what the American colonists called the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill settlements]] along the [[Little Tennessee River]], southwest of Knoxville.

The first white traders and explorers were recorded as arriving in the Tennessee Valley in the late 17th century. There is significant evidence that Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] visited Bussell Island in 1540.<ref>[[Jefferson Chapman]], ''Tellico Archaeology: 12,000 Years of Native American History'' (Norris, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1985), 97.</ref> The first major recorded Euro-American presence in the Knoxville area was the [[Timberlake Expedition]], which passed through the confluence of the Holston and French Broad into the Tennessee River in December 1761. [[Henry Timberlake]], an Anglo-American emissary from the British colonies to the Overhill settlements along the Little Tennessee River, recalled being pleased by the deep waters of the Tennessee after his party had struggled down the relatively shallow Holston for several weeks.<ref>Henry Timberlake, Samuel Williams (ed.), ''Memoirs, 1756–1765'' (Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co., 1948), 54.</ref>

===Settlement===
[[File:James White's Fort 20.jpg|thumb|[[James White's Fort]] in downtown Knoxville]]
The end of the [[French and Indian War]] and confusion brought about by the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] led to a drastic increase in Euro-American settlement west of the Appalachians.<ref>William MacArthur, ''Knoxville, Crossroads of the New South'' (Tulsa, Okla.: Continental Heritage Press, 1982), 1-15.</ref> By the 1780s, white settlers were already established in the Holston and French Broad valleys. The U.S. Congress ordered all illegal settlers out of the valley in 1785, but with little success. As settlers continued to trickle into Cherokee lands, tensions between the settlers and the Cherokee rose steadily.<ref>Yong Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site: A Civil War Union Encampment on the Southern Heights of Knoxville, Tennessee'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Transportation Center, 1993), 9.</ref>

In 1786, [[James White (general)|James White]], a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] officer, and his friend James Connor built [[White's Fort]] near the mouth of First Creek, on land White had purchased three years earlier.<ref name="ReferenceA">Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site'', 9.</ref> In 1790, White's son-in-law, [[Charles McClung]]—who had arrived from Pennsylvania the previous year—surveyed White's holdings between First Creek and Second Creek for the establishment of a town.  McClung drew up 64 {{convert|0.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} lots. The waterfront was set aside for a town common.  Two lots were set aside for a church and graveyard (First Presbyterian Church, founded 1792). Four lots were set aside for a school.  That school was eventually chartered as Blount College and it served as the starting point for the [[University of Tennessee]], which uses Blount College's founding date of 1794, as its own. Also in 1790, President [[George Washington]] appointed North Carolina surveyor [[William Blount]] governor of the newly created [[Territory South of the River Ohio]].

[[File:Holstontreaty.JPG|thumb|Statue representing the signing of the Treaty of the Holston in Downtown Knoxville]]
One of Blount's first tasks was to meet with the Cherokee and establish territorial boundaries and resolve the issue of illegal settlers.<ref>MacArthur, 17.</ref> This he accomplished almost immediately with the [[Treaty of Holston]], which was negotiated and signed at White's Fort in 1791.  Blount originally wanted to place the territorial capital at the confluence of the [[Clinch River]] and Tennessee River (now [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]]), but when the Cherokee refused to cede this land, Blount chose White's Fort, which McClung had surveyed the previous year.  Blount named the new capital Knoxville after Revolutionary War general and Secretary of War [[Henry Knox]], who at the time was Blount's immediate superior.<ref>William MacArthur, Jr., ''Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South'' (Tulsa, Oklahoma: Continental Heritage Press, 1982), 17-22.</ref>

Problems immediately arose from the Holston Treaty. Blount believed that he had "purchased" much of what is now East Tennessee when the treaty was signed in 1791. However, the terms of the treaty came under dispute, culminating in continued violence on both sides. When the government invited Cherokee chief [[Hanging Maw]] for negotiations in 1793, Knoxville settlers attacked the Cherokee against orders, killing the chief's wife. Peace was renegotiated in 1794.<ref>G. H. Stueckrath, "[http://www.knoxcotn.org/history/debow.html Incidents in the Early Settlement of East Tennessee and Knoxville] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401050724/http://www.knoxcotn.org/history/debow.html |date=April 1, 2009 }}."

===Antebellum era===
[[File:Craighead-Jackson House 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Craighead-Jackson House]] in Knoxville, built in 1818]]

Knoxville served as capital of the [[Southwest Territory]] and as capital of Tennessee (admitted as a state in 1796) until 1817,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> when the capital was moved to [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]. Early Knoxville has been described as an "alternately quiet and rowdy river town."<ref name=wheeler /> Early issues of the ''[[Knoxville Gazette]]''—the first newspaper published in Tennessee—are filled with accounts of murder, theft, and hostile Cherokee attacks. Abishai Thomas, a friend of William Blount, visited Knoxville in 1794 and wrote that, while he was impressed by the town's modern frame buildings, the town had "seven taverns" and no church.<ref>MacArthur, ''Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South'', 23.</ref>

Knoxville initially thrived as a way station for travelers and migrants heading west. Its location at the confluence of three major rivers in the Tennessee Valley brought [[flatboat]] and later [[steamboat]] traffic to its waterfront in the first half of the 19th century, and Knoxville quickly developed into a regional merchandising center. Local agricultural products—especially tobacco, corn, and whiskey—were traded for cotton, which was grown in the [[Deep South]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The population of Knoxville more than doubled in the 1850s with the arrival of the [[East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad]] in 1855.<ref name=wheeler />'

Among the most prominent citizens of Knoxville during the Antebellum years was James White's son, [[Hugh Lawson White]] (1773–1840). White first served as a judge and state senator, before being nominated by the state legislature to replace [[Andrew Jackson]] in the U.S. Senate in 1825. In 1836, White ran unsuccessfully for president, representing the Whig Party.<ref>Jonathan Atkins, "[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1497 Hugh Lawson White] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702071628/http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1497 |date=July 2, 2017 }}."

Anti-slavery and anti-secession sentiment ran high in East Tennessee in the years leading up to the [[American Civil War]].

Business interests, however, guided largely by Knoxville's trade connections with cotton-growing centers to the south, contributed to the development of a strong pro-secession movement within the city. The city's pro-secessionists included among their ranks Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey, a prominent historian whose father had built the [[Ramsey House (Knox County, Tennessee)|Ramsey House]] in 1797.

Thus, while East Tennessee and greater Knox County voted decisively against secession in 1861, the city of Knoxville favored secession by a 2-1 margin. In late May 1861, just before the secession vote, delegates of the [[East Tennessee Convention]] met at Temperance Hall in Knoxville in hopes of keeping Tennessee in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. After Tennessee voted to secede in June, the convention met in Greeneville and attempted to create a separate Union-aligned state in East Tennessee.<ref>MacArthur, ''Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South'', 42-44.</ref><ref>Eric Lacy, ''Vanquished Volunteers: East Tennessee Sectionalism from Statehood to Secession'' (Johnson City, Tenn.: East Tennessee State University Press, 1965), pp. 217-233.</ref>

In July 1861, after Tennessee had joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], General [[Felix Zollicoffer]] arrived in Knoxville as commander of the District of East Tennessee. While initially lenient toward the city's Union sympathizers, Zollicoffer instituted martial law in November, after pro-Union guerrillas burned seven of the city's bridges. The command of the district passed briefly to [[George Crittenden]] and then to [[Kirby Smith]], who launched an unsuccessful invasion of Kentucky in August 1862. In early 1863, General [[Simon Buckner]] took command of Confederate forces in Knoxville. Anticipating a Union invasion, Buckner fortified Fort Loudon (in West Knoxville, not to be confused with the [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|colonial fort]] to the southwest) and began constructing earthworks throughout the city. However, the approach of stronger Union forces under [[Ambrose Burnside]] in the summer of 1863 forced Buckner to evacuate Knoxville before the earthworks were completed.<ref>Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site'', 10.</ref>

Burnside arrived in early September 1863. Like the Confederates, he immediately began fortifying the city. The Union forces rebuilt Fort Loudon and erected 12 other forts and batteries flanked by entrenchments around the city. Burnside moved a pontoon bridge upstream from [[Loudon, Tennessee|Loudon]], allowing Union forces to cross the river and build a series of forts along the heights of South Knoxville, including Fort Stanley and Fort Dickerson.<ref>Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site'', 10-12.</ref>

As Burnside was fortifying Knoxville, the Confederate army defeated the Union forces at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (near the Tennessee-Georgia line) and laid siege to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]]. On November 3, 1863, the Confederates sent General [[James Longstreet]] to attack Burnside at Knoxville.  Longstreet wanted to attack the city from the south, but lacking the necessary pontoon bridges, he was forced to cross the river further downstream at Loudon (November 14) and march against the city's heavily fortified western section. On November 15, General [[Joseph Wheeler]] unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge Union forces in the heights of South Knoxville, and the following day Longstreet failed to cut off retreating Union forces at [[Battle of Campbell's Station|Campbell's Station]] (now Farragut). On November 18, Union General [[William P. Sanders]] was mortally wounded while conducting delaying maneuvers west of Knoxville, and Fort Loudon was renamed Fort Sanders in his honor. On November 29, following a two-week siege, the Confederates attacked Fort Sanders, but failed after a fierce 20-minute engagement. On December 4, after word of the Confederate setback at [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] reached Longstreet, he abandoned his attempts to capture Knoxville and went into winter quarters at [[Russellville, Tennessee|Russellville]]. He rejoined the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] the following Spring.<ref>Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site'', 15-17.</ref>

===Reconstruction and the Industrial Age===

After the war, northern investors such as the brothers Joseph and David Richards helped Knoxville recover relatively quickly. Joseph and David Richards convinced 104 [[Welsh American|Welsh immigrant families]] to migrate from the [[Welsh Tract]] in [[Pennsylvania]] to work in a rolling mill then co-owned by Thomas Walker. These Welsh families settled in an area now known as [[Mechanicsville, Knoxville|Mechanicsville]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Richards brothers also co-founded the Knoxville Iron Works beside the [[L&N Railroad]], also employing Welsh workers.

Other companies that sprang up during this period were Knoxville Woolen Mills, Dixie Cement, and Woodruff's Furniture.

The post-war manufacturing boom brought thousands of immigrants to the city.  The population of Knoxville grew from around 5,000 in 1860 to 32,637 in 1900.  West Knoxville was annexed in 1897, and over 5,000 new homes were built between 1895 and 1904.<ref name=wheeler>W.

The growing city of Knoxville hosted the Appalachian Exposition in 1910 and again in 1911, and the [[National Conservation Exposition]] in 1913. The latter is sometimes credited with giving rise to the movement to create a [[national park]] in the Great Smoky Mountains, some {{convert|20|mi|km}} south of Knoxville.<ref name="Jack Neely 2006">Jack Neely, "Knoxville, Tennessee." ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 654.</ref> Around this time, a number of affluent Knoxvillians began purchasing summer cottages in [[Elkmont, Tennessee|Elkmont]], and began to pursue the park idea more vigorously. They were led by Knoxville businessman Colonel [[David C.

Knoxville's reliance on a manufacturing economy left it particularly vulnerable to the effects of the [[Great Depression]].  The Tennessee Valley also suffered from frequent flooding, and millions of acres of farmland had been ruined by soil erosion. To control flooding and improve the economy in the Tennessee Valley, the federal government created the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] in 1933. Beginning with [[Norris Dam]], TVA constructed a series of hydroelectric and other power plants throughout the valley over the next few decades, bringing flood control, jobs, and electricity to the region.<ref name=wheelertva>W. Bruce Wheeler, "[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1362 Tennessee Valley Authority] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830171439/http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1362 |date=August 30, 2011 }}."

Knoxville's textile and manufacturing industries largely fell victim to foreign competition in the 1950s and 1960s, and after the establishment of the [[Interstate Highway]] system in the 1960s, the railroad—which had been largely responsible for Knoxville's industrial growth—began to decline. The rise of suburban shopping malls in the 1970s drew retail revenues away from Knoxville's Downtown area.  While government jobs and economic diversification prevented widespread unemployment in Knoxville, the city sought to recover the massive loss of revenue by attempting to annex neighboring communities in Knox County.  These annexation attempts often turned combative, and several attempts to merge the Knoxville and Knox County governments failed though the school boards merged on July 1, 1987.<ref name=wheeler/>

With annexation attempts stalling, Knoxville initiated several projects aimed at boosting revenue in the Downtown area. The [[1982 World's Fair]]—the most successful of these projects—became one of the most popular world's fairs in U.S. history with 11 million visitors.  The fair's energy theme was selected due to Knoxville being the headquarters of the Tennessee Valley Authority and for the city's proximity to the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].  The [[Sunsphere]], a {{convert|266|ft|m|adj=on}} steel truss structure topped with a gold-colored glass sphere, was built for the fair and remains one of Knoxville's most prominent structures,<ref>W.

Ever since, Knoxville's downtown has been developing, with the opening of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame and the Knoxville Convention Center, redevelopment of Market Square, a new visitors center, a [[Museum of East Tennessee History|regional history museum]], a [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Cinemas]] theater, several restaurants and bars, and many new and redeveloped condominiums. Since 2000, Knoxville has successfully brought business back to the downtown area. The arts in particular have begun to flourish; there are multiple venues for outdoor concerts, and Gay Street. hosts a new arts annex and gallery surrounded by many studios and new business as well. The Tennessee and Bijou Theaters underwent renovation, providing a good basis for the city and its developers to re-purpose the old downtown.<ref name="revitalize">{{cite web |title=Revitalizing Gay Street in Knoxville |url=https://architectsandartisans.com/revitalizing-gay-street-in-knoxville/ |website=Architects + Artisans |accessdate=August 3, 2020 |date=May 6, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Knoxville is situated in the [[Great Appalachian Valley]] (known locally as the Tennessee Valley), about halfway between the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] to the east and the [[Cumberland Plateau]] to the west.  The Great Valley is part of a sub-range of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] known as the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]], which is characterized by long, narrow ridges, flanked by broad valleys.  Prominent Ridge-and-Valley structures in the Knoxville area include Sharp's Ridge and Beaver Ridge in the northern part of the city, Brown Mountain in South Knoxville, parts of [[Bays Mountain]] just south of the city, and parts of McAnnally Ridge in the northeastern part of the city.

The [[Tennessee River]], which slices through the downtown area, is formed in southeastern Knoxville at the confluence of the [[Holston River]], which flows southwest from Virginia, and the [[French Broad River]], which flows west from North Carolina.  The section of the Tennessee River that passes through Knoxville is part of Fort Loudoun Lake, an artificial reservoir created by TVA's [[Fort Loudoun Dam]] about {{convert|30|mi|km}} downstream in [[Lenoir City, Tennessee|Lenoir City]].  Notable tributaries of the Tennessee in Knoxville include First Creek and Second Creek, which flow through the downtown area, Third Creek, which flows west of U.T., and Sinking Creek, Ten Mile Creek, and Turkey Creek, which drain West Knoxville.

===Metropolitan Area===
{{Main|Knoxville Metropolitan Area}}
Knoxville is the central city in the Knoxville Metropolitan Area, an [[Office of Management and Budget|Office of Management and Budget (OMB)]]-designated [[metropolitan statistical area|metropolitan statistical area (MSA)]] that covers Knox, [[Anderson County, Tennessee|Anderson]], [[Blount County, Tennessee|Blount]], Campbell, [[Grainger County, Tennessee|Grainger]], [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon]], Morgan, Roane and [[Union County, Tennessee|Union]] counties.  MSAs consist of a core urban center and the outlying communities and rural areas with which it maintains close economic ties. They are not administrative divisions, and should not be confused with a [[consolidated city-county]] government, which Knoxville and Knox County is absent of.<ref name=Censusmetro />

The Knoxville Metropolitan area includes unincorporated communities such as [[Halls Crossroads, Tennessee|Halls Crossroads]], [[Powell, Tennessee|Powell]], [[Karns, Tennessee|Karns]], [[Corryton, Tennessee|Corryton]], [[Concord, Knox County, Tennessee|Concord]], and [[Mascot, Tennessee|Mascot]], which are located in Knox County outside of Knoxville's city limits.  Along with Knoxville, major municipalities in the Knoxville Metropolitan Area include [[Alcoa, Tennessee|Alcoa]], [[Blaine, Tennessee|Blaine]], [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], [[Lenoir City, Tennessee|Lenoir City]], [[Loudon, Tennessee|Loudon]], [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Rutledge, Tennessee|Rutledge]], [[Clinton, Tennessee|Clinton]], [[Bean Station, Tennessee|Bean Station]], and [[Maynardville, Tennessee|Maynardville]].  As of 2012, the population of the Knoxville Metropolitan Area was 837,571.<ref name=Censusmetro>[https://www.census.gov/population/www/metroareas/metroarea.html Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923210008/http://www.census.gov/population/www/metroareas/metroarea.html |date=September 23, 2011 }}, U.S. Census Bureau</ref>

Additionally, the Knoxville MSA is the chief component of the larger OMB-designated [[Knoxville]]-[[Sevierville]]-[[LaFollette, Tennessee|La Follette]] [[Tennessee|TN]] [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA). The CSA also includes the [[Morristown, Tennessee|Morristown]] [[Morristown metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] ([[Hamblen County, Tennessee|Hamblen]], [[Grainger County, Tennessee|Grainger]], and [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson]] counties) and the [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]] ([[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]), [[La Follette, Tennessee|La Follette]] ([[Campbell County, Tennessee|Campbell County]]), [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] ([[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]]), and [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]] ([[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]) [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]]s.  Municipalities in the CSA, but not the Knoxville MSA, include Morristown, [[Rutledge, Tennessee|Rutledge]], [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]], [[Jefferson City, Tennessee|Jefferson City]], Sevierville, [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]], LaFollette, [[Jacksboro, Tennessee|Jacksboro]], Harriman, [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and Newport. The combined population of the CSA as of the 2000 Census was 935,659. Its estimated 2008 population was 1,041,955.<ref name=Censusmetro/>

[[Georgia Tech]] researchers have mapped the Knoxville Metropolitan area as one of the 18 'Major Cities' in the Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cqgrd.gatech.edu/program_areas/megaregions/pam.php|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5t38MCgRL?url=http://www.cqgrd.gatech.edu/program_areas/megaregions/pam.php|url-status=dead|title=Georgia Institute of Technology :: CQGRD : Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion (PAM)|archivedate=September 27, 2010}}</ref>

The downtown area contains a mixture of architectural styles from various periods, ranging from the hewn-log James White House (1786) to the modern [[Knoxville Museum of Art]] (1990).  Styles represented include [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] ([[Old City Hall (Knoxville)|Old City Hall]]), Victorian (Hotel St. Oliver and Sullivan's Saloon), Gothic ([[Church Street Methodist Church (Knoxville, Tennessee)|Church Street Methodist Church]] and [[Ayres Hall]]), [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] (First Baptist Church), and [[Art Deco]] ([[United States Post Office and Courthouse (Knoxville, Tennessee)|Knoxville Post Office]]).  Gay Street, Market Square, and Jackson Avenue contain numerous examples of late-19th and early-20th century commercial architecture.

Residential architecture tends to reflect the city's development over two centuries. [[Blount Mansion]] (1791), in the oldest part of the city, is designed in a vernacular [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style.  "Streetcar suburbs" such as [[Fourth and Gill]], [[Parkridge (Knoxville, Tennessee)|Parkridge]], and [[Fort Sanders (Knoxville neighborhood)|Fort Sanders]], developed in the late 19th century with the advent of [[streetcar|trolleys]], tend to contain large concentrations of Victorian and [[Bungalow]]/[[American Craftsman|Craftsman]]-style houses popular during this period.  Early automobile suburbs, such as [[Lindbergh Forest]] and [[Sequoyah Hills, Tennessee|Sequoyah Hills]], contain late-1920s and 1930s styles such as [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]], English Cottage, and Mission Revival.  Neighborhoods developed after World War II typically consist of [[Ranch-style house]]s.

Knoxville is home to the nation's largest concentration of homes designed by noted Victorian residential architect [[George Franklin Barber]], who lived in the city.<ref>Knox Heritage, [http://www.knoxheritage.org/sites/default/files/KH%20George%20Barber%20Homes%20Tour_web.pdf George Barber Homes Trolley Tour Booklet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726233012/http://www.knoxheritage.org/sites/default/files/KH%20George%20Barber%20Homes%20Tour_web.pdf |date=July 26, 2011 }}, 2007. Retrieved: January 7, 2012.</ref>  Other notable local architects include members of the [[Baumann family (architects)|Baumann family]], [[Charles I. Barber]] (son of George), [[R. F. Graf]], and more recently, [[Bruce McCarty]].  Nationally renowned architects with works still standing in the city include [[Alfred B. Mullett]] ([[Greystone (Knoxville)|Greystone]]), [[John Russell Pope]] (H.L. Dulin House), and [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]] (Knoxville Museum of Art).

===Neighborhoods===
Knoxville is roughly divided into the [[Downtown Knoxville|Downtown area]] and sections based on the four cardinal directions: [[North Knoxville]], [[South Knoxville]], [[East Knoxville]], and [[West Knoxville]].  Downtown Knoxville traditionally consists of the area bounded by the river on the south, First Creek on the east, Second Creek on the west, and the railroad tracks on the north, though the definition has expanded to include the U.T. campus and Fort Sanders neighborhood,<ref name=parks /> and several neighborhoods along or just off Broadway south of Sharp's Ridge ("Downtown North").<ref>City of Knoxville, [http://www.cityofknoxville.org/downtownnorth/ Downtown North Redevelopment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513225605/http://www.cityofknoxville.org/downtownnorth/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}.
