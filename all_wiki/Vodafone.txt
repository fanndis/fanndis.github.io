==Name==
The name Vodafone comes from '''vo'''ice '''da'''ta '''fone''' (the latter a [[sensational spelling]] of "[[telephone|phone]]"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".<ref>{{Cite web |title=UK – About Us – History – 1982 |url=http://online.vodafone.co.uk/dispatch/Portal/appmanager/vodafone/wrp?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=template09&pageID=PAV_0015&tabIndex=3 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720035452/http://online.vodafone.co.uk/dispatch/Portal/appmanager/vodafone/wrp?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=template09&pageID=PAV_0015&tabIndex=3 |archive-date=20 July 2012 |publisher=Vodafone Group}}</ref>

==History==
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of [[Racal|Racal Electronics]], the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with [[Millicom]] called 'Racal', which evolved into the present Vodafone.<ref name="VOD-G-H-01">{{Cite web |title=Origin of Vodafone |url=http://www.theoriginof.com/vodafone.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106161734/http://www.theoriginof.com/vodafone.html |archive-date=6 January 2016 |access-date=13 July 2012 |publisher=theoriginof.com}}</ref><ref name="VOD-G-H-02">{{Cite web |title=History of Racal electronics plc |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/racal-electronics-plc-history/ |access-date=13 July 2012 |publisher=fundinguniverse.com}}</ref><ref name="VOD-G-H-03">{{Cite web |title=History of Vodafone |url=http://www.celtnet.org.uk/telecos/vodafone.php |access-date=13 July 2012 |publisher=celtnet.org.uk}}</ref>

===Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991===
[[File:Vodafone 1984 logo.svg|right|thumb|Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997]]
In 1980, [[Ernest Harrison]], the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with [[Lord Weinstock]] of the [[General Electric Company plc|General Electric Company]] to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battlefield radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, [[Gerry Whent]], was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by [[General Electric]] (unrelated to GEC) in [[Virginia]], USA, the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wilson |first=Richard |date=19 February 2009 |title=Obituary: Sir Ernest Harrison |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2009/02/19/45500/obituary-sir-ernest-harrison.htm |access-date=29 June 2010 |publisher=electronicsweekly.com}}</ref>

[[Jan Stenbeck]], head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom Inc, and approached Gerry Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to concerns of the British government about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Millicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network licence.<ref name=":8">Hultens, Staffan and Molleryd, Bengt (28 June 2000), "Entrepreneurs, Innovations and Market Processes in the Evolution of the Swedish Mobile Telecommunications Industry". Retrieved 9 September 2013</ref> Final ownership of Racal-Millicom Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties, and the venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd … provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 December 1982 |title=Cellular Telephone System, Written Answers by Mr. Butcher to House of Commons (Vol 34 cc211-3W) |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1982/dec/16/cellular-telephone-system |access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref>

Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,<ref>{{Cite journal |year=1984 |title=Racal Calls up Vodafone |journal=Electronics and Power |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=268 |doi=10.1049/ep.1984.0137}}</ref> with its first office based in the Courtyard in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], Berkshire, and<ref>{{Cite news |date=4 February 2000 |title=The rapid rise of Vodafone |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/business/527754.stm |access-date=27 May 2010}}</ref> shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.<ref name="sec">{{Cite web |title=Vodafone Group Public Ltd Co |url=http://www.secinfo.com/d139r2.21Pc.b.htm |access-date=2 April 2007}}</ref> On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110&nbsp;million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Eadie |first=Alison |date=30 December 1986 |title=Racal pays £110&nbsp;million to own Vodafone |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers}}</ref>

On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the [[London Stock Exchange]] with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics<!---(estimated at £1.7&nbsp;billion)--->. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.<ref>{{Cite news |date=27 October 1988 |title=Shares in Racal Telecom |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Newspapers}}</ref><ref name="VOD-G-H-04">{{Cite web |title=Racal's Key Milestones |url=http://salbu.co.za/vodafone/Racal_KeyMilestones.html |access-date=13 July 2012 |publisher=salbu.co.za}}</ref>

===Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000===
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as '''Vodafone Group''', with Gerry Whent as its CEO.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wise |first=Deborah |date=16 September 1991 |title=Vodafone's solo debut could boost share price |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Newspapers}}</ref>

In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cane |first=Alan |date=10 July 1996 |title=Companies and Finance: UK: Vodafone acquires Talkland in Pounds 60m deal |page=22 |work=Financial Times}}</ref> On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased [[Peoples Phone]] for £77&nbsp;million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reguly |first=Eric |date=20 November 1996 |title=Vodafone pockets Peoples Phone |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers}}</ref> In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.<ref>{{Cite news |date=7 February 1997 |title=News Digest: Vodafone snaps up Astec |page=55 |work=Investors Chronicle}}</ref>

In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and [[Chris Gent|Christopher Gent]] took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its ''Speechmark'' logo, composed of a [[quotation mark]] in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vodafone logo |url=https://www.famouslogos.us/vodafone-logo/ |access-date=14 April 2017 |publisher=Famous logos}}</ref>

On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of [[AirTouch Communications|AirTouch Communications, Inc.]] and changed its name to '''Vodafone Airtouch plc'''. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hasell |first=Nick |date=30 June 1999 |title=Scramble for Vodafone as blue chips retreat |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers}}</ref> The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of [[Mannesmann]], owner of the largest German mobile network.<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 November 1999 |title=Vodafone AirTouch Considers Making a Bid for Mannesmann |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB942272098114329805 |access-date=14 April 2017 |publisher=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> To gain antitrust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in Mannesmann's German competitor, [[E-Plus|E-Plus Mobilfunk]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Krause |first=Reinhardt |date=8 June 1999 |title=Vodafone's Quest Begins With AirTouch Alliance |work=Investor's Business Daily |url=http://investors.com/IBDArchives/ArtShow.asp?atn=324329775205550&sy=&kw=&ps=440&ac=WBM |access-date=4 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927031357/http://investors.com/IBDArchives/ArtShow.asp?atn=324329775205550&sy=&kw=&ps=440&ac=WBM <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref>

On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of [[Verizon Communications|Bell Atlantic Corp]] to form [[Verizon Wireless]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=22 September 1999 |title=Making airwaves |work=Financial Times}}</ref> The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with [[GTE]] to form Verizon Communications, Inc.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 June 2000 |title=Bell Atlantic and GTE Chairmen Praise FCC Merger Approval |url=http://newscenter2.verizon.com/press-releases/verizon/2000/page-29759036.html |access-date=10 January 2014 |publisher=Verizon}}</ref>

In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for [[Mannesmann]], which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter's purchase of [[Orange (UK)|Orange]], the UK mobile operator.<ref>{{Cite news |date=14 November 1999 |title=Mannesmann rejects Vodafone bid |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/519813.stm |access-date=6 April 2007}}</ref> Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.<ref name="mann merger">{{Cite news |date=3 February 2000 |title=Vodafone seals Mannesmann merger |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/630166.stm |access-date=6 April 2007}}</ref> The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112&nbsp;billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.<ref name="mann merger" /> The [[European Union|EU]] approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by [[Orange S.A.|France Télécom]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=11 February 2000 |title=Vodafone seals Mannesmann merger |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/630293.stm |access-date=26 December 2008}}</ref>

===Vodafone Group plc: 2000 to present===
[[File:A Bucuresti street scene -i.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The headquarters of [[Vodafone Romania]] in Bucharest]]
On 28 July 2000, the Company reverted to its former name, '''Vodafone Group plc'''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2 September 2013 |title=Timeline to Vodafone's $130 Billion Verizon Deal |url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/61810.php |access-date=14 April 2017 |publisher=Cellular News}}</ref>

On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing [[TDC A/S|TDC]] Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)<ref>[http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?ID=396301 TDC forms roaming partnership with Vodafone] Reuters, 17 December 2001</ref>

In November 1998, the [[Vodafone Egypt]] network went live under the name Click GSM, and was rebranded to Vodafone in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Vodafone Egypt |url=https://www.vodafone.com.eg/vodafoneportalWeb/en/P613722281289132343406 |access-date=26 June 2020 |publisher=Vodafone Egypt}}</ref>

On 8 November 2006, the company announced a deal with [[Telecom Egypt]], resulting in further co-operation in the Egyptian market and increasing its stake in Vodafone Egypt. After the deal, Vodafone Egypt was 55% owned by the group, while the remaining 45% was owned by Telecom Egypt.<ref>{{Cite web |date=8 November 2006 |title=Vodafone and Telecom Egypt announce new strategic partnership |url=http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=200611080820267244L |access-date=14 April 2017 |publisher=Investegate{{sic|hide=y}}}}</ref>

On 29 January 2020, Saudi Telecom Company (STC) and the Vodafone Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the sale of Vodafone's entire 55 percent stake in Vodafone Egypt to STC. With the sale, Vodafone will be exiting Egypt (as a telecom operator) as the rest of the 45 percent stake in Vodafone Egypt is owned by Telecom Egypt.

In November 2005, Vodafone announced that it was in exclusive talks to buy a 15% stake of VenFin in Vodacom Group, reaching agreement the following day. Vodafone and [[Telkom (South Africa)|Telkom]] then had a 50% stake each in [[Vodacom]].

On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15% stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008. The agreement called for Telkom to sell 15 per cent of its 50 per cent stake in Vodacom to the group, and demerge the other 35 per cent to its shareholder.

==Corporate affairs==

===Senior management===
[[Gerry Whent|Sir Gerald Whent]], at that time an Executive with Racal Electronics plc, was responsible for the bid for a UK Cellular Network licence. The Mobile Telecoms division was de-merged, and was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in October 1988 and Sir Gerald became Chief Executive of Racal Telecom plc. Over the next few years the company grew to become the UK's Market Leader, changing its name to Vodafone Group plc in the process.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cowe |first=Roger |date=29 May 2002 |title=Sir Gerald Whent |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/29/guardianobituaries.rogercowe |access-date=14 April 2017}}</ref>

[[Chris Gent|Sir Christopher Gent]] took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald's retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany's Mannesmann.<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 February 2003 |title=Sir Christopher's biggest regret |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2843598/Sir-Christophers-biggest-regret.html |access-date=14 April 2017 |publisher=The Telegraph}}</ref>

[[Arun Sarin]] was the driving force behind the Company's move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arun Sarin conferred Honorary knighthood |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business/arun-sarin-conferred-honorary-knighthood/story-AV2br4Hh4ir4I3LmaSCyAM.html |access-date=14 April 2017}}</ref>

===Tax avoidance===
In September 2010, an investigation by ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of [[Mannesmann]] through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with [[HMRC]] (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25&nbsp;billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{Cite news |title=BRITAIN'S £6BN VODAFONE BILL |work=Private Eye |url=http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=in_the_back&issue=1273 |url-status=dead |access-date=11 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027221207/http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=in_the_back&issue=1273 |archive-date=27 October 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The news of this legal [[tax avoidance]] sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of [[UK Uncut]]. The protests caused the closure of various stores across the UK.<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 June 2014 |title=UK Uncut protesters blockade Vodafone stores across country |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/14/uk-uncut-vodafone |website=The Guardian}}</ref>

In 2011, ''Private Eye'' magazine and The [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill of a little over £2&nbsp;billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6&nbsp;billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vodafone: Undercover investigation exposes Swiss branches: TBIJ |url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/03/06/vodafone-undercover-investigation-exposes-swiss-branches/ |access-date=15 May 2012 |publisher=Thebureauinvestigates.com}}</ref>

Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5&nbsp;billion tax over its acquisition of [[Hutchison Whampoa]]'s Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{Cite news |date=20 January 2012 |title=Vodafone not liable for up to $4.4bn of India penalties |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16646347 |access-date=20 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=22 October 2010 |title=Vodafone given $2.5bn Indian tax bill deadline |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11606192 |access-date=31 March 2011}}</ref> However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=India sends renewed £1.4bn tax notice to Vodafone |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35584980 |access-date=27 March 2016 |website=BBC News}}</ref> In September 2020, an international arbitration tribunal sided with Vodafone and ruled that India's efforts to claim past taxes was in violation of fair treatment under the bilateral investment protection pact between India and the Netherland. India was asked by the tribunal to stop its efforts to claim the tax dues.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vodafone Scores a Victory in $3 Billion Tax Dispute With India |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/vodafone-scores-a-victory-in-243-billion-tax-dispute-with-india/ar-BB19pRCO |access-date=2020-09-25 |website=www.msn.com}}</ref>

===Communications blackout during the Arab Spring===
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in [[2011 Egyptian protests|Egypt's 2011 demonstrations]]. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under [[Hosni Mubarak]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=27 January 2011 |title=Egypt Internet users report major network disruptions |work=Reuters |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/tunisiaNews/idAFLDE70Q2P220110127}}</ref> On 28 January 2011, Vodafone complied with Egyptian government instructions to suspend Internet service "in selected areas" during a period of [[2011 Egyptian protests|anti-Mubarak protests]].

===Poor customer service===
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail"{{snd}} a website of the same name still exists.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Moses |first=Asher |title=Vodafone customers seething over dropped calls, slow data |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/vodafone-customers-seething-over-dropped-calls-slow-data-20101210-18sev.html |access-date=11 December 2012}}</ref> In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Network guarantee – Vodafone Australia |url=http://www.vodafone.com.au/aboutvodafone/network/network-guarantee?pid=v:pers:home:networks-guarantee:link:find-out-more |access-date=11 December 2012 |publisher=Vodafone.com.au}}</ref>

===Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones===
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited [[roaming]] costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brignall |first=Miles |title=Vodafone customer's £15,000 billing nightmare after mobile phone theft |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/17/vodafone-customer-billing-nightmare-mobile-theft |access-date=21 March 2015 |website=the Guardian}}</ref>
