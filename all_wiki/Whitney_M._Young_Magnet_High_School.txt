'''Whitney M. Young Magnet High School''' (locally known simply as '''Whitney Young''') is a [[state school|public]] [[magnet school|magnet]] [[high school]] and [[middle school]] located in the [[Near West Side, Chicago|Near West Side]] neighborhood in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States. Whitney Young is operated by the [[Chicago Public Schools]] district. Whitney Young opened on September 3, 1975 as the city's first public magnet high school. The school is named after [[Whitney Young|Whitney Moore Young Jr.]], a prominent African-American [[civil rights]] leader.

==History==
The Chicago Public Schools announced plans for a public magnet school on the city's Near West Side in mid–1970. A proposal by community residents called for a high school to be built at 211 S. Laflin, which was an empty lot that had been burned out during the [[1968 Chicago riots|riots]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} following the assassination of the [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.]] on April 4, 1968. The school opened on September 3, 1975, as a selective enrollment school under the leadership of the school's first principal, Bernarr E. Dawson.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===Founding faculty===
The founding staff developed and planned the initial curriculum and policies for the school: Joe Korner (English), Jory Chelin (Math), Melanie Wojtulewicz (Science), Larry Minkoff (Social Studies), Roger Stewart (Tech), Sandra McKinley (Librarian), and Dr. William Marshall (Hearing Impaired). The principal's secretary was Lillian O'Neill. The staff met for months unpaid in the unused John Phillips Sousa school building while the Young building was under construction.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}
