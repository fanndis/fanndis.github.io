The '''Electorate of Hanover''' ({{lang-de|Kurfürstentum Hannover}} or simply ''Kurhannover'') was an [[Prince-elector|Electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], located in northwestern Germany and taking its name from the capital city of [[Hanover]]. It was formally known as the '''Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg''' ({{lang-de|Kurfürstentum Braunschweig-Lüneburg}}). For most of its existence, the electorate was ruled in [[personal union]] with Great Britain and Ireland following the [[Hanoverian Succession]].

The [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] had been split in 1269 between different branches of the [[House of Welf]]. The [[Principality of Calenberg]], ruled by a cadet branch of the family, emerged as the largest and most powerful of the Brunswick-Lüneburg states. In 1692, the Holy Roman Emperor elevated the Prince of Calenberg to the [[Prince-elector|College of Electors]], creating the new Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The fortunes of the Electorate were tied to those of Great Britain by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and [[Act of Union 1707]], which settled the succession to the British throne on [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne's]] nearest Protestant relative, the [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia of Hanover]], and her descendants.<ref name=barm>{{cite web |url= http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/rezensionen/2007-2-145.pdf |title= Hannover und die englische Thronfolge  |publisher= H-Soz-Kult | author= Heide Barmeyer  | access-date= March 20, 2020  }}</ref>

==Name==
In 1692, Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] elevated Duke [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ernest Augustus]] of the Brunswick-Lüneburg line of [[Principality of Calenberg|Calenberg]], to the rank of [[prince-elector]] of the Empire as a reward for aid given in the [[Nine Years' War]]. There were protests against the addition of a new elector, and the elevation did not become official until the approval of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] in 1708. Calenberg's capital, [[Hanover]], became colloquially eponymous for the electorate, but it officially used the name ''Chur-Braunschweig-Lüneburg'' of the entire ducal dynasty.

==Geography==
[[File:Hanover1720.png|thumb|left|Sketch map of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg including the Hanover electorate (blue) and the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (green), c. 1720: Elector George I Louis acquired [[Saxe-Lauenburg]] and [[Bremen-Verden]], his successor George II Augustus gained [[Land Hadeln]] (1731, in the map the bulk of the beige tip at the Elbe estuary) and George III acquired the [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück]] (1803)]]
The electorate comprised large parts of the modern German state of [[Lower Saxony]] in [[Northern Germany]]. Beside the Principality of Calenberg it also included the former princely lands of [[Principality of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[Principality of Grubenhagen|Grubenhagen]] as well as the territory of the former [[County of Hoya]].

In 1705 Elector [[George I of Great Britain|George I Louis]] inherited the [[Principality of Lüneburg]] with the Duchy of [[Saxe-Lauenburg]] upon the death of his uncle Duke [[George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|George William of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]. In 1715 he purchased the Duchies of [[Bremen-Verden]] from King [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] (confirmed by the 1719 [[Treaties of Stockholm (Great Northern War)|Treaty of Stockholm]]), whereby his former landlocked electorate gained access to the [[North Sea]].

In 1700, the territories forming the electorate introduced, like all other Protestant territories of [[imperial immediacy]], the Improved Calendar, as the [[Gregorian calendar]] was called by [[Protestants]] to avoid mentioning the name of Pope [[Gregory XIII]]. Sunday, 18 February (Old Style) was thus followed by Monday, 1 March ([[New Style]]).

== History ==
{{main|History of Hanover}}

In 1692, the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, elevated George's son, Duke Ernest Augustus to the rank of Elector of the Empire as a reward for aid given in the War of the Grand Alliance. There were protests against the addition of a new Elector, and the elevation did not become official (with the approval of the Imperial Diet) until 1708, in the person of Ernest Augustus's son, George Louis. Though the Elector's titles were properly Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, he is commonly referred to as the Elector of Hanover after his residence.

Hanover acquired Bremen-Verden in 1719.

The Electorate was legally bound to be indivisible: it could add to its territory, but not alienate territory or be split up among several heirs; and its succession was to follow male primogeniture. The territory assigned to the Electorate included the Brunswick-Lüneburg principalities of Calenberg, Grubenhagen, and Lüneburg (even though at the time Lüneburg was ruled by Ernest Augustus's older brother) and the counties of Diepholz and Hoya.

===Link with Great Britain===
[[File:Civil Ensign of Hannover (1727-1801).svg|thumb|150px|right|Civil Ensign 1727–1801.]]
In 1714, [[George I of Great Britain|George Louis]] became king of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], so that the electorate and Great Britain and Ireland were ruled in [[personal union]]. The possessions of the electors in Germany also grew, as they ''de facto'' purchased the formerly [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]]-held duchies of [[Duchy of Bremen|Bremen]] and [[Principality of Verden|Verden]] in 1719.

George Louis died in 1727, and was succeeded by his son [[George II of Great Britain|George II Augustus]]. In 1728 Emperor [[Charles VI (Holy Roman Empire)|Charles VI]] officially [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffed]] George II (i.e. gave him land in exchange for a pledge of service), with the reverted fief of [[Saxe-Lauenburg]], which had ''de facto'' been ruled in personal union with Hanover and with one of its preceding [[Principality of Lüneburg]] since 1689.

In 1731 Hanover also gained [[Land of Hadeln|Hadeln]].{{sfn|Wilson|2016|page=583}} In return, Hanover recognized the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] which changed Habsburg inheritance law.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|page=583}} It took George II Augustus until 1733 to persuade Charles VI to enfeoff him also with the Duchy of Bremen and the Principality of Verden, colloquially called Duchies of Bremen-Verden. At both enfeoffments George II Augustus swore that he would respect the existing privileges and constitutions of the [[Estates of the Realm|estates]] in Bremen-Verden and in Hadeln, thus confirming 400-year-old traditions of estate participation in government.

In [[Hanover]], the capital of the Electorate, the [[Privy Council of Hanover]] (electoral government) installed a new ministry in charge of the [[Imperial Estate]]s ruled by the Electors in personal union. It was called the Department of Bremen-Verden, Hadeln, Lauenburg and [[County of Bentheim|Bentheim]]. However the Electors spent most of their time in England. Direct contact with the Electorate was maintained through the office of the [[German Chancery]], situated in [[St James's Palace]] in London.

===Seven Years' War===
{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years War}}
During the Anglo-[[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763) in the North American colonies, Britain feared a French invasion in Hanover. George II [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|formed an alliance]] with his [[Kingdom of Prussia|Brandenburg-Prussian]] cousin [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II, "the Great"]] combining the North American conflict with the Brandenburg-Prusso–Austrian [[Seven Years' War|Third Silesian or Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763).

In summer 1757 the [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|French invaded Hanover]] and defeated George II's son [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]], leading the [[Hanoverian Army of Observation|Anglo-Hanoverian army]], at the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]] and drove him and his army into remote Bremen-Verden, where in the former ''[[Zeven]]'' {{Interlanguage link multi|Zeven Convent|de|3=Kloster Zeven|lt=''Convent''}} he capitulated on 18 September ([[Convention of Kloster-Zeven]]). But George II did not recognise the convention. In the following year the British army, supported by troops from [[Kingdom of Prussia|Brandenburg-Prussia]], [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] and the ducal [[Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Principality of Brunswick and Lunenburg (Wolfenbüttel)]] again expelled the occupants.

===French Revolutionary Wars===
Hanover remained unaffected for the rest of the war. After the war ended, peace prevailed until the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] started. The [[First Coalition|War of the First Coalition against France]] (1792–1797) with Great Britain-Hanover and other war allies forming the coalition, did not affect Hanoverian territory, since the first [[French First Republic|French Republic]] was fighting on several fronts, even on its own territory. However, men were drafted to recruit the 16,000 Hanoverian soldiers fighting in the [[Low Countries]] under British command against France. In 1795 the [[Holy Roman Empire]] declared its neutrality, including Hanover; however, a peace treaty with France was under negotiation until it failed in 1799. Brandenburg-Prussia, however, ended for its part the war with France by the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] (1795), stipulating that Brandenburg-Prussia would ensure the Holy Roman Empire's neutrality in all the latter's territories north of the demarcation line of the river [[Main (river)|Main]], including the British continental dominions of Hanover, Bremen-Verden, and Saxe-Lauenburg. To this end Hanover also had to provide troops for the so-called demarcation army maintaining the armed neutrality.<ref name="Riotte2005">{{cite book|author=Torsten Riotte|title=Hannover in der britischen Politik (1792-1815): dynastische Verbindung als Element aussenpolitischer Entscheidungsprozesse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brgcjRBqXh0C|year=2005|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7551-0}}</ref>

===Napoleonic era===
During the [[War of the Second Coalition|War of the Second Coalition against France]] (1799–1802) [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] urged Brandenburg-Prussia to occupy the continental British dominions. In 1801 24,000 Brandenburg-Prussian soldiers invaded, surprising Hanover, which surrendered without a fight. In April 1801 the Brandenburg-Prussian troops arrived in Bremen-Verden's capital, [[Stade]], and stayed there until October that year. The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] first ignored Brandenburg-Prussia's hostility, but when the latter joined the pro-French coalition of armed neutral powers including [[Denmark-Norway]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Britain began to capture Brandenburg-Prussian ships. After the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)]] the coalition fell apart and Brandenburg-Prussia withdrew its troops.

As part of the [[German Mediatisation]] of 25 February 1803, the Electorate received the [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück]] in [[real union]], whose every second ruler had been alternately members of the [[House of Hanover]] since 1662.

After Britain – this time without any allies – had declared war on France (18 May 1803), French troops invaded Hanover on 26 May. According to the [[Convention of Artlenburg]] (5 July 1803), confirming the military defeat of Hanover, the Hanoverian army was disarmed and its horses and ammunitions were handed over to the French. The Privy Council of Hanover, with minister [[Friedrich Franz Dieterich von Bremer]] holding up the Hanoverian stake,{{clarify|date=August 2015}} fled to [[Saxe-Lauenburg]] across the Elbe, ruled by Britain-Hanover in personal union. Soon afterwards the French also occupied Saxe-Lauenburg.

In autumn 1805, at the beginning of the [[War of the Third Coalition|War of the Third Coalition against France]] (1805), the French occupying troops left Hanover in a campaign against [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]]. British, Swedish and Russian coalition forces captured Hanover. In December the [[First French Empire|Empire of the French]], since 1804 France's new government, ceded Hanover, which it did not hold any more, to Brandenburg-Prussia, which captured it early in 1806.

On 6 August 1806 the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved, thereby abolishing the function of prince-electors electing its emperors. Thus the title of [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Elector of Brandenburg]] became meaningless for the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. After it had turned against France, it was defeated in the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]] (11 November 1806), and France recaptured Hanover.

Following the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 the new [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] was founded, ruled by Napoléon's brother [[Jérôme Bonaparte]], then including territories of the former Electorate of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Cassel]], the ducal [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]]ian principality [[Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], and formerly Prussian territories. In early 1810 Hanover proper and Bremen-Verden, but not Saxe-Lauenburg, were also annexed by Westphalia. In an attempt to assert the [[Continental System]], the French Empire annexed in late 1810 all the continental North Sea coast (as far as Denmark) and the areas along the sections of the rivers navigable for seagoing vessels, including Bremen-Verden and Saxe-Lauenburg and some adjacent territories of Hanover proper.

However, the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] did not recognise the French annexation, being at war continuously with France through the entire period, and Hanoverian ministers continued to operate out of London. The Privy Council of Hanover maintained its own separate diplomatic service, which maintained links with countries such as [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], with whom the United Kingdom itself was technically at war. The Hanoverian army was dissolved, but many of the officers and soldiers went to England, where they formed the [[King's German Legion]]. The Legion was the only German army to fight continually all through the Napoleonic wars against the French.

French control lasted until October 1813, when the territory was overrun by Russian troops, and the [[Battle of Leipzig|Battle of the Nations]] at [[Leipzig]] later the same month spelled the definitive end to the Napoleonic client state of Westphalia, as well as the entire [[Confederation of the Rhine]], after which the rule of the [[House of Hanover]] was restored. The former electorate became the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], confirmed at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814.

{{main|House of Hanover}}

The Electorate was legally indivisible: it could add to its territory, but not alienate territory or be split up among several heirs – as used to be the rule before, having led at times to a multitude of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]]ian principalities. Its succession was to follow male [[primogeniture]]. Since this was against the [[Salic law]], then valid for the ducal family, the change needed imperial confirmation, which Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] granted in 1692.

In 1692, at its upgrading to the rank of electorate, its territory comprised the Brunswick-Lüneburgian principalities of [[Principality of Calenberg|Calenberg]] and [[Principality of Grubenhagen|Grubenhagen]], which the line of the former{{clarify|date=August 2015}} had already inherited in 1665. But before the confirmation of the electorate by the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] in 1708 the Calenberg line further inherited the principality of [[Lüneburg-Celle|Celle]] in 1705. Further included were the earlier acquired counties of [[County of Diepholz|Diepholz]] and [[County of Hoya|Hoya]].

Although the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved in 1806, George III's government did not consider the dissolution to be final, and he continued to be styled "Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg, Arch-treasurer and Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire" until 1814.

Although the Electoral title became defunct with the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, George III did not recognise this dissolution, and retained the Electoral title until early 1814, when he was proclaimed King of Hanover, a title which was universally recognised during the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15).
