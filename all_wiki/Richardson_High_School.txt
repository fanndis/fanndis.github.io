In 2015, 2016, and 2017, Richardson High School was one of the few hundred schools in the state of Texas, and the only high school in [[Richardson Independent School District|RISD]] to earn all 7 distinctions in the [[State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness|STAAR state assessment]].<ref>{{cite web |title=More than 400 campuses earn all possible distinctions in 2017 accountability ratings |website=tea.texas.gov |url=https://tea.texas.gov/About_TEA/News_and_Multimedia/Press_Releases/2017/More_than_400_campuses_earn_all_possible_distinctions_in_2017_accountability_ratings/ |access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref>

In the 2012 ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings of the Best Schools in America, Richardson High School ranked number 711 out of 21,766 public high schools, putting it in the top 3.5% of all public high schools in the United States. RHS was also rated the 65th best in the state of Texas.<ref name="USNWR_RHS-overview">{{cite news |title=Education: Richardson High School Overview |work=U.S. News and World Report |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/texas/districts/richardson-independent-school-district/richardson-high-school-19768 |accessdate=February 21, 2013}}</ref>

In August 2006, Richardson High School was named one of three "best practices" high schools in the state of Texas.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hughes |first=Kristine |date=August 18, 2006 |title=Richardson High recognized for its teamwork |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=11398BF2F10C88A8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |accessdate=August 17, 2012}} (payment required)</ref> The award granted by the National Council of Educational Accountability and the Just 4 Kids Foundation is based upon staff development, staff retention, standardized test scores and support programs for students.

In May 2007, the RISD was awarded the "Excellence in Education Award for Large School District in Texas" by the HEB Foundation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Weiss |first=Jeffrey |title=How Richardson ISD beat its peers in getting the class of '09 college-ready|date=September 3, 2011|publisher=dallasnews.com |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20110903-how-richardson-isd-beat-its-peers-in-getting-the-class-of-09-college-ready.ece |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref> Richardson High School and Richardson West Junior High played instrumental roles in the selection process and hosted the site visit committee in March 2007. In addition to the award, the RISD received a check for $100,000.

The school, which opened shortly after the first public school in the city was burned down by Ross Inman in 1890, began in a two-room building on Old Pike Road, a street that is now part of Greenville Avenue. A rural school with fewer than 100 students up to 1950, the school opened its present facility in 1961. During the period of the late 1950s, RHS shared facilities with Westwood Junior High School on Abrams Road. Bill Passmore was principal during this transition into the new facility on Belt Line Road.

Richardson's sports mascot is the Eagles and the team shares Eagle-Mustang Stadium (capacity 12,000) with [[J. J. Pearce High School]]. 
The school's student news magazine is the ''Talon''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mattiza|first=F.|url=http://neighborsgoblog.dallasnews.com/2009/10/richardson-rhs-graduate-anne-r.html/|title=Richardson: RHS graduate Anne Rice releases 29th novel|date=October 28, 2009|publisher=dallasnews.com|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>

As of the 2018-2019 school year, the administration at RHS is led by Chris Choat,<ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome to Richardson HS / Staff Directory |url=https://schools.risd.org/Page/4609 |website=schools.risd.org |accessdate=16 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Principal; Michelle King, Associate Principal; Bill Parker, Magnet Principal; Von Ensley, Assistant Principal; Ramiro Lucio, Assistant Principal; Elise Curry, Assistant Principal; Jose Vega, Assistant Principal; and Tara McLennan, Assistant Principal.
