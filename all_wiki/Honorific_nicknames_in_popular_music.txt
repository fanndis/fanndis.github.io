'''Honorific nicknames in popular music''' are terms used, most often in the media or by fans, to indicate the significance of an artist, and are often [[Pantheon (gods)|religious]], [[Kinship terminology|familial]], or (most frequently) [[Imperial, royal and noble ranks|royal and aristocratic]] titles, used [[metaphor]]ically. Honorific nicknames were used in classical music in Europe even in early nineteenth century, with figures such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] being called "The father of modern music" and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] "The father of modern piano music".<ref>A. R. Frey, ''Sobriquets and Nicknames'' (1888, published online by brBiblioBazaar, 2009), p. 115.</ref> They were also particularly prominent in African-American culture in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, perhaps as a means of conferring status that had been negated by [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]],<ref>S. S. Walker, "What's in a name: Black awareness keeps the African tradition of 'meaningful names' alive", ''Ebony'', vol. 32 (8), (June 1977), pp. 74–8.</ref> and as a result entered early jazz and blues music, including figures such as [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Count Basie]].<ref>D. Evans, "From Bumble Bee Slim to Black Boy Shine: Nicknames of Blues Singers" in D. Evans, ed., ''Ramblin' on my mind: new perspectives on the blues: African American music in global perspective'' (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2008), pp. 179–222.</ref>

In [[Culture of the United States|U.S. culture]], despite its [[Republicanism|republican]] constitution and ideology,<ref>S. Deger-Jalkotzy and I. S. Lemos, ''Ancient Greece: from the Mycenaean palaces to the age of Homer'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), p. 272.</ref> honorific nicknames have been used to describe leading figures in various areas of activity, such as industry, commerce, sports, and the media; ''father'' or ''mother'' have been used for [[innovators]], and royal titles such as ''king'' and ''queen'' for dominant figures in a field.<ref>M. Benoliel and Linda Cashdan, ''The Upper Hand: Winning Strategies from World-Class Negotiators'' (Adams Media, 2006), p. 26.</ref><ref>B. G. Rader, ''Baseball: a history of America's game'' (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 3rd edn., 2008), p. 140.</ref> In the 1930s and 1940s, as jazz and swing music were gaining popularity, it was the more commercially successful white artists [[Paul Whiteman]] and [[Benny Goodman]] who became known as "The King of Jazz" and "The King of Swing" respectively, despite there being more highly regarded contemporary African-American artists.<ref name=Bynoe200p155>Y. Bynoe, ''Stand and deliver: political activism, leadership, and hip hop culture'' (Soft Skull Press, 2004), p. 155.</ref> These patterns of naming were transferred to rock and roll when it emerged in the 1950s. There was a series of attempts to find (and a number of claimants to be) the "King of Rock 'n' Roll", a title that became most associated with [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>M. T. Bertrand, ''Race, rock, and Elvis: Music in American life'' (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2000), p. 220.</ref> This has been characterized as part of a process of the appropriation of credit for innovation of the then new music by a white establishment.<ref>G. B. Rodman, "A hero to most?; Elvis, myth and the politics of race", ''Cultural Studies'' vol. 8 (3), (1994), p. 474.</ref> Different honorifics have been taken or given for other leading figures in the genre, such as "The Architect of Rock and Roll", by [[Little Richard]] from the 1990s,<ref>J. Warner, ''On this day in black music history'' (Hal Leonard Corporation, 2006), p. 56,</ref> but this term, like many, is also used for other important figures, in this case including pioneer electric guitarist [[Les Paul]].<ref name=rockhallLesPaul>{{cite web |title=Les Paul |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/les-paul |publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum}}</ref>

Similar honorific nicknames have been given in other genres, including [[Aretha Franklin]], who was literally crowned "Queen of Soul" by [[Disc jockey|disk jockey]] [[Pervis Spann]] on stage in 1968.<ref>A. Kempton, ''Boogaloo: the Quintessence of American Popular Music'' (University of Michigan Press, 2005), p. 58.</ref> [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Madonna]] have been closely associated with the terms "King of Pop" and "Queen of Pop" since the 1980s.<ref>{{citation|first=Alison|last=Hawes|title=Music and Fashion|publisher=Badger Learning|year=2014|pages=23|isbn=9781781477588|quote=Many of the most successful pop artists of the Eighties were solo singers.
