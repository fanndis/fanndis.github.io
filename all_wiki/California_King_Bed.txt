Lyrically, the song was considered a "break-up song" that talks about "the waking death of a relationship, the stage of limbo before the final crash."<ref name="Anderson"/> As [[Digital Spy]]'s Robert Copsey added, its lyrics discuss "the kind of separate-togetherness felt moments before a break-up."<ref name="Copsey"/> Adam R. Holz of [[Plugged In]] noticed that "'California King' ponders how a woman could be so physically close to a man yet so emotionally distant. She doesn't get an answer, but she does quip about evidence of their sexual relationship on the sheets the next morning. The woman also equates asking the man if he loves her with emotional weakness."<ref name="pluggedin">{{cite web|last1=Holz|first1=Adam R.|title=Loud Album Review (2010)|url=http://www.pluggedin.com/music-reviews/album/rihanna-loud/|publisher=Plugged In|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}</ref> During the chorus, she sings: "In this California king bed we’re ten thousand miles apart / I’ve been California wishing on these stars for your heart / For me, my California king."<ref name="Shetler"/>

<blockquote>I think it's something that is so unique about Rihanna whatever she's doing, whatever character she's playing, whatever side of herself she's showing, she's in it 1,000 percent... And I think the song and the theme of this song, she wanted to obviously show a softer side, a lighter side, one that's caught in maybe a tumultuous relationship... There's so much variety with her and it's been such a journey with her.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663878/rihanna-california-king-bed.jhtml|title=Rihanna Gives Fans 'Another Twist' In 'California King Bed,' Director Says|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=2011-05-13|accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref></blockquote>

Almost the whole video set is made in tropical and romantic setting. The video begins with a shot of Rihanna herself laying down in grass. Then scenes of Rihanna walking on the beach and Rihanna curling up on the chair are shown. This is followed by her own and her partner holding each other closely in bed, sitting on different sides of a large bed, and other scenes featuring Rihanna singing through sheer curtains and drapery. In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/5852041/rihanna-california-king-bed-video|title=Rihanna Cozies Up In The World's Largest "California King Bed" In Her New Video|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|date=2011-05-09|accessdate=2011-05-09}}</ref>

===Reception===
As stated by Jason Lipshutz of ''Billboard'', in this video, Rihanna returned to nature as in her video for her previous single, "Only Girl (In the World)", which features nearly the same colors as the "California King Bed" video. Lipshutz also commented that Rihanna's just rolled-out-bed appearance is completed by the modest, cream-colored attire in the airy, light-filled clip.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mapes|first=Gillian|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/471661/rihannas-california-king-bed-video-premieres|title=Rihanna's 'California King Bed' Video Premieres|work=Billboard|accessdate=2011-05-09}}</ref> Brad Wete of ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave a positive review of the video, writing: "Instead of being in complete control, here she is—vulnerable, open, and unsure. The video captures the feel of 'King Bed,' not that it's a difficult one to grasp."<ref>{{cite web|last=Wete|first=Brad|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/05/09/rihanna-california-king-bed-video/|title=Rihanna dreams of love in new 'California King Bed' video: Watch it here|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=2011-05-09|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref> Jessica Sinclair of ''[[Long Island Press]]'' was also positive about the video, praising the sensual side of Rihanna.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sinclair|first=Jessica|url=http://www.longislandpress.com/2011/05/09/rihanna-california-king-bed-california-king-bed-video/|title=Rihanna California King Bed : California King Bed Video|work=[[Long Island Press]]|publisher=Morey Publishing|date=2011-05-09|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref> A writer of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' concluded: "In the video for her new video, 'California King Bed,' the Barbadian pop star slows it down and shows her sensitive side, holding notes and bearing her soul over a troubled relationship.
