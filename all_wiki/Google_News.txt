'''Google News''' is a [[news aggregator]] service developed by [[Google]]. It presents a continuous flow of articles organized from thousands of publishers and magazines. Google News is available as an app on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], and [[Web application|the Web]].

Google released a [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta version]] in September 2002 and the official app in January 2006.<ref>Krishna Bharat, [http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/and-now-news.html "And now, News"], The Official Google Blog, January 23, 2006. "We're taking Google News out of beta! When we launched the English-language edition in September 2002, we entered untested waters with a grand experiment in news browsing – using computers to organize the world's news in real time and providing a bird's eye view of what's being reported on virtually any topic. By presenting news "clusters" (related articles in a group), we thought it would encourage readers to get a broader perspective by digging deeper into the news – reading ten articles instead of one, perhaps – and then gain a better understanding of the issues, which could ultimately benefit society. A bit more than three years later, we offer 22 regional editions in 10 languages, and have a better sense of how people use Google News". Accessed June 19, 2008.</ref> The initial idea was developed by [[Krishna Bharat]].<ref name=notwar>{{cite web|last=Glaser|first=Mark|title=Google News to Publishers: Let's Make Love Not War|publisher=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2010/02/google-news-to-publishers-lets-make-love-not-war035.html|date=February 4, 2010|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref><ref name="googlefriends">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/googlefriends/morejul03.html|title=Google Friends Newsletter – Q&A with Krishna Bharat |date=July 2003|publisher=Google|accessdate=April 4, 2009}}</ref>

==Details==
As of 2013, Google News was watching more than 50,000<ref>{{cite news|last1=Filloux|first1=Frederic|title=Google News: the secret sauce|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/feb/25/1|accessdate=8 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=25 February 2013}}</ref> news sources worldwide. Versions for more than 60 regions in 28 languages were available in March 2012. {{As of|2015|09}}, service is offered in the following 35 languages: [[Arabic]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Cantonese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Hindi]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Malayalam]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].<ref name="Google News Blog">{{cite web|url=http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.lt/2015/08/spreading-news-in-new-languages.html|title=Google News Blog: Spreading the News in New Languages|work=Google News Blog}}</ref>

The service covers news articles appearing within the past 30 days on various news websites. In total, Google News aggregates content from more than 20,000 publishers.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Joshua |last=Cohen |title=Same Protocol, More Options for News Publishers |url=http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/same-protocol-more-options-for-news.html |quote=There are more than 25,000 publishers from around the world in Google News today.  |publisher=Google News Blog |date=December 2, 2009 |accessdate=April 5, 2010 }}</ref> For the English language, it covers about 4,500 sites;<ref>As used to be reported by Google. See also Segev, Elad (2010). Google and the Digital Divide: The Biases of Online Knowledge, Oxford: Chandos Publishing.</ref> for other languages, fewer. Its front page provides roughly the first 200 characters of the article and a link to its larger content.

On December 1, 2009, Google announced changes to their "first click free" program,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/10/first-click-free-for-web-search.html|title=Official Google Webmaster Central Blog: First Click Free for Web Search|work=Official Google Webmaster Central Blog}}</ref>{{clarify|What was it before?|date=December 2014}} which has been running since 2008 and allows users to find and read articles behind a [[paywall]].

The layout of Google News underwent a major revision on May 16, 2011.

On July 14, 2011, Google introduced "Google News Badges",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/15/google-news-badges-we-dont-need-no-stinking-google-news-badges/|title=Google News Badges? We Don’t Need No Stinking Google News Badges|author1=Robin Wauters|date=July 15, 2011|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}</ref> which it later retired in October 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2012-09-google-news-badges-house.html|title=Google strips news badges in house cleaning}}</ref>

Additionally in July 2011, the Sci/Tech section of the English Google News versions was split up into two sections: Science and Technology. It was announced that this section split would be performed on other language versions as well.<ref name="Mohanty">{{cite web |url=http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/shareable-google-news-badges-for-your.html|title=Google News Blog: Shareable Google News badges for your favorite topics|last=Mohanty|first=Natasha|date=July 14, 2011|work=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}</ref> {{As of|2013|01|alt=As of early 2013}}, this split had not been applied to all language versions of Google News.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In June 2017, the desktop version of Google News saw a thorough redesign that according to Google had the goal to "make news more accessible and easier to navigate ... with a renewed focus on facts, diverse perspectives, and more control for users."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.blog.google/topics/journalism-news/redesigning-google-news-everyone/ |title=Redesigning Google News for everyone|date=2017-06-27|publisher=Google|access-date=2017-07-03|language=en}}</ref> Yet several options such as the search tools menu were removed along with the redesign, making searches much more difficult. It now uses a card format for grouping related news stories, and as summarized by [[Engadget]], "doesn't look like a search results page anymore", removing text snippets and blue links.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/27/google-news-redesigned-cleaner-look/ |title=Google News redesigned with a cleaner look |website=Engadget|access-date=2017-07-03}}</ref>

Historically users could choose to hide articles originating from a news source. These hidden sources can still be listed in a user's settings however these exclusions are no longer honoured. The option to exclude a source of news items is no longer presented.

According to a 2020 study in the journal ''Nature Human Behavior'', Google News tends to prioritize national news outlets when individuals search for keywords, unless the keywords specifically relate to topics of local interest.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Sean|last2=Jaidka|first2=Kokil|last3=Lelkes|first3=Yphtach|date=2020-09-21|title=Auditing local news presence on Google News|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00954-0|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=en|pages=1–9|doi=10.1038/s41562-020-00954-0|issn=2397-3374}}</ref> As a consequence, the Google News algorithm may divert web traffic away from local news outlets, depriving them of advertiser money.<ref name=":0" />

==Controversies with publishers==
===EU copyright and database right===
In March 2005, [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) sued Google for $17.5&nbsp;million, alleging that Google News infringed on its copyright because "Google includes AFP's photos, stories and news headlines on Google News without permission from Agence France Presse".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.resourceshelf.com/legaldocs/afpvgoogle1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 5, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050512032757/http://www.resourceshelf.com/legaldocs/afpvgoogle1.pdf |archive-date=May 12, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.dcealumni.com/376/20305-googles-news-sued-for-infringing-agence-france-presse-copyrighted-work/ |title=News Journal » Google's news sued for infringing Agence France Presse copyrighted work |publisher=News.dcealumni.com |date=2005-03-19 |accessdate=2013-06-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217024710/http://news.dcealumni.com/376/20305-googles-news-sued-for-infringing-agence-france-presse-copyrighted-work/ |archive-date=February 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It was also alleged that Google ignored a [[cease and desist]] order, though Google counters that it has opt-out procedures which AFP could have followed but did not. Google now hosts Agence France-Presse news, as well as the [[Associated Press]], [[Press Association]] and the [[Canadian Press]]. This arrangement started in August 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.directtrafficmedia.co.uk/Google_starts_hosting_news_stories_18265222.html |title=Google starts hosting news stories |publisher=DTM news |date=August 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029232516/http://news.directtrafficmedia.co.uk/Google_starts_hosting_news_stories_18265222.html |archive-date=October 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2007, Google announced it was paying for Associated Press content displayed in Google News, however the articles are not permanently archived.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Google News Becomes A Publisher |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=PBT2QGMTUGF0AQSNDLOSKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=201803549&_requestid=555255 |quote="Because the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, U.K. Press Association and the Canadian Press don't have a consumer Web site where they publish their content, they have not been able to benefit from the traffic that Google News drives to other publishers", Josh Cohen, business product manager for Google News, explained in a blog post.

In 2007, a preliminary injunction and then a Belgian court ruled that Google did not have the right to display the lead paragraph from French-language Belgian news sources when Google aggregated news stories,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bad news for Google in Belgium. |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/09/22/business/google.php |quote=The earlier decision required Google to stop displaying extracts of French and German-language articles from Belgian newspapers. |work=International Herald Tribune |date=September 22, 2006 |accessdate=September 25, 2007}} The majority Dutch-language press is fully included in Google News</ref> nor to provide free access to cached copies of the full content ("in cache" feature),<ref>{{cite news|url=<!--https://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2007/copiepresse-v-google-->|title= Copiepresse v Google - the Belgian judgment dissected|author=Graham Smith|date=March 2007}}</ref> due to both copyright and the [[sui generis database rights]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2006.11.004|title=Google News banned by Brussels High Court – Copiepresse SCRL v.

Once again, this finding seems expeditious as it appears from the decision that he did not actually verify whether the databases met the legal conditions to benefit from the sui generis rights provided for in the Act of 1998. One of the examinations in the ongoing proceedings before the Belgian courts is whether the newspapers' websites actually qualify as databases8 and whether substantial invest- ments were made. Should the Court rule that the newspapers’ websites are protected by the sui generis rights, it further has to assess whether Google News has extracted substantial parts of their databases, or at least, that systematic or repeated extractions of unsubstantial parts of these databases were made. At first sight, this last question is likely to be replied in the affirmative, given how Google News is described and considering its modus operandi.}}</ref>
Google responded by removing the publications both from Google News and the main Google web search.<ref name=Ars/>
According to the 2009 ''Report on the outlook for copyright in the EU'',
{{quote|With the Google-Copiepresse judgment of 13 February 2007, on the other hand, the Belgian judge ruled that a copy of a webpage memorised by the Google server and the existence of a link giving public access to the same webpage contravene the rights of reproduction and communication to the public. [...]  the Belgian judge took the view that Google’s reproduction without comment of parts of articles was not covered by this exception. The same judgement does not consider the exception in respect of quotations for purposes such as criticism or review provided for in Article 5.3.d to be applicable to the Google News service.|<ref>{{citation|url=<!--http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A6-2009-0017+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN-->|author=Committee on Legal Affairs / Rapporteur: [[Manuel Medina Ortega]]|id=2008/2121(INI)|date=2009-01-26|publisher=European Parliament|title= Report on the outlook for copyright in the EU}}</ref>}}
In May 2011 the ruling was upheld in appeal<ref>{{cite news|url=<!--https://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2011/05/you-cant-copy-press-unless-youre-with.html-->|title=You can't copy press unless you're with Copiepresse|author=Jeremy Phillips|date=2011-05-10}}</ref> after Google reiterated most legal defences from the first grade plus some new ones, which the Court rejected based on the [[Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening|''Infopaq'' ruling]] and others.
In July 2011, Copiepress publications were restored on Google News after they requested so and renounced any complaint based on the judgement.<ref>{{cite news|url=<!--https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/google-versus-belgium-who-is-winning-nobody/-->|title=Google v.

Nevertheless, in a 2017 briefing on the [[ancillary copyright for press publishers]] paid by the [[European Commission]], Prof. Höppner thought the ''sui generis'' database right was not violated by most platforms on the basis that the "substantial part" criterion may be too high a bar after C-444/02 ''[[Fixtures Marketing v. OPAP]]''<ref>{{citation|url=<!--http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=49635&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=6388136-->|title=JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Grand Chamber) 9 November 2004 (1)       Directive 96/9/EC – Legal protection of databases – Definition of database – Scope of the sui generis right – Football fixture lists – Betting)  In Case C-444/02,  REFERENCE for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC, from the Monomeles Protodikio Athinon (Greece), made by decision of 11 July 2002, received at the Court on 9 December 2002, in the proceedings  Fixtures Marketing Ltd  v  Organismos prognostikon agonon podosfairou AE (OPAP),|id=ECLI:EU:C:2004:697}}</ref> and that no publisher was known to have won a case with it.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The proposed Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (Articles 11, 14 and 16): Strengthening the Press Through Copyright|doi=10.2861/31274|url=<!--http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2017/596835/IPOL_BRI(2017)596835_EN.pdf-->|author= Thomas Höppner|quote=The database right generally requires the use of a substantial part of a database or, where only insubstantial parts are used, that the use is repeated and the systematic character is equivalent to the use of a substantial part. 15 For many platforms, this will not be case.

===Publisher right===
{{see also|ancillary copyright for press publishers}}
Some Europe-based news outlets have asked their governments to consider making Google pay to host links. In Germany, their lobbying lead the introduction of the [[ancillary copyright for press publishers]] in 2013. In October 2014, a group of German publishers granted Google a license to use snippets of their publications [[Gratis versus libre|gratis]]; the group had first claimed that such snippets were illegal, and then complained when they were removed by Google.<ref>[https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141023/06145528919/german-publishers-grant-google-free-license-google-never-needed-to-post-news-snippets.shtml German Publishers Grant Google A 'Free License' Google Never Needed To Post News Snippets], TechDirt.</ref>
In December 2014, Google announced it would be shutting down the Google News service in [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/google-news-to-close-up-shop-in-spain-in-response-to-new-law/|title=Google News to close up shop in Spain in response to new law|date=December 11, 2014|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}</ref> A new law in Spain, lobbied for by the Spanish newspaper publishers' association [[AEDE]], would require that news aggregators would have to pay news services for the right to use snippets of their stories on Google News.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/11/google-news-spain-to-close-in-response-to-tax-on-story-links Google News Spain to close in response to story links 'tax]</ref> Google chose to shut down their service and remove all links to Spain-based news sites from international versions of the site.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30426496|title=Google to shut Spanish news service|newspaper=BBC News|date=2014-12-11}}</ref>

The attempt at establishing a publisher right on press publications was then repeated at EU level with the [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market]].

==Features and customization==
A pull-down menu at the top of search results enables users to specify the time period in which they wish to search for articles. This menu includes options such as: past day, past week, past month, or a custom range.

Users can request e-mail "alerts" on various keyword topics by subscribing to [[Google News Alerts]]. E-mails are sent to subscribers whenever news articles matching their requests come online. Alerts are also available via [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feeds.

Users used to be able to customize the displayed sections, their location on the page, and how many stories are visible with a [[JavaScript]]-based [[drag and drop]] interface. However, for the US site, this has been disabled in favor of a new layout; roll-out of this layout is planned for other locales in the near future. Stories from different editions of Google News can be combined to form one personalized page, with the options stored in a [[HTTP cookie|cookie]]. The service has been integrated with Google Search History since November 2005. Upon its graduation from beta, a section was added that displays recommended news based on the user's Google News search history and the articles the user has clicked on (if the user has signed up for Search History).

A revamped version of Google News was introduced in May 2018 that included [[artificial intelligence]] features to help users find relevant information.<ref name="TC_AI">{{cite news |last1=Perez |first1=Sarah |title=Google News gets an AI-powered redesign |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/google-news-gets-an-ai-powered-redesign/ |accessdate=January 29, 2019 |work=TechCrunch |date=May 8, 2018}}</ref>

==News Archive Search==
{{Main|Google News Archive}}

On June 6, 2006, Google News expanded, adding a News Archive Search feature, offering users historical archives going back more than 200 years from some of its sources. There was a timeline view available, to select news from various years.

An expansion of the service was announced on September 8, 2008, when Google News began to offer indexed content from scanned newspapers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bringing history online, one newspaper at a time|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/bringing-history-online-one-newspaper.html |quote=Today, we're launching an initiative to make more old newspapers accessible and searchable online by partnering with newspaper publishers to digitize millions of pages of news archives.|publisher=Google |date=September 8, 2008 |accessdate=September 8, 2008 }}</ref> The depth of chronological coverage varies; beginning in 2008, the entire content of the ''[[New York Times]]'' back to its founding in 1851 has been available.

In early 2010, Google removed direct access to the archive search from the main Google News page, advanced news search page and default search results pages. These pages indicated that the search covered "Any time", but did not include the archive and only included recent news.

During the summer of 2010, Google decided to redesign the format of the Google news page, creating a firestorm of complaints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/news/label?lid=06c20bed07a04da6&hl=en |title=Google Discussiegroepen |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref>

In May 2011, Google cancelled plans to scan further old newspapers. About 60 million newspaper pages had been scanned prior to this event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/20/google_ends_newspaper_scanning_project/|title=Google euthanizes newspaper archive scan plan}}</ref> Google announced that it would instead focus on "[[Google One Pass]], a platform that enables publishers to sell content and subscriptions directly from their own sites".<ref>{{cite news |title=Google Ending Newspaper Archiving Project |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2385664,00.asp | newspaper=[[PC Magazine]] |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=May 20, 2011 |first=Leslie |last=Horn}}</ref>

In August 2011, the "News Archive Advanced Search" functionality was removed entirely, again generating complaints from regular users who found that the changes rendered the service unusable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/support/forum/p/news/thread?tid=11abf9e92882b59f&hl=en&fid=11abf9e92882b59f0004aafec50a9040 |title=Google Discussiegroepen |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref> Archival newspaper articles could still be accessed via the Google News Search page, but key functionalities such as the timeline view and ability to specify more than 10 results per page were removed.

On September 7, 2008, [[United Airlines]], which was the subject of an indexed, archived article, lost and later not quite regained US$1&nbsp;billion in market value when a 2002 ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article about the bankruptcy filing of the airline in that year appeared in the current "most viewed" category on the website of the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel]]'', a sister paper.<ref name=Helft /> Google News index's next pass found the link as new news, and Income Security Advisors found the Google result to be new news, which was passed along to [[Bloomberg News]], where it was briefly a current headline and very widely viewed.<ref name=Helft>{{Cite news|author=Helft, Miguel|title=How a Series of Mistakes Hurt Shares of United|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/technology/15google.html|work=New York Times |accessdate=September 15, 2008 | date=September 15, 2008}}</ref>
