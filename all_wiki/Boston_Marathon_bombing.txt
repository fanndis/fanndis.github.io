During the annual [[Boston Marathon]] on April 15, 2013, two homemade pressure cooker bombs detonated 14 seconds and {{convert|210|yd|m}} apart at 2:49{{nbsp}}p.m., near the finish line of the race, killing 3 people and injuring hundreds of others, including 17 who lost limbs.<ref name="NYDN-5/15" /><ref name="globe-number-injured" /><ref name="cnn-what-we-know" />

Three days later, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) released images of two suspects,<ref name="Clark Estes" /><ref name="AutoLC-4" /><ref name="AutoLC-5" /> who were later identified as Chechen [[Kyrgyzstan]]i-American brothers [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]] and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]]. Following the suspects' identification, they killed an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department#Shooting by Boston Marathon bombing suspects|MIT policeman]], kidnapped a man in his car, and had a shootout with the police in nearby [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], during which two officers were severely injured (one of whom died a year later). Tamerlan was shot several times, and his brother Dzhokhar ran him over while escaping in the stolen car; Tamerlan died soon after.

An unprecedented manhunt for Dzhokhar ensued on April 19, with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown;<ref name="AutoLC-6" /> residents of Watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors, and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed.<ref name="AutoLC-7" /><ref name="AutoZ2-1" /> Around 6:00{{nbsp}}p.m., a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard.<ref>"Two unnamed officials say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, did not have a gun when he was captured Friday in a Watertown, Mass. backyard.

During questioning, Dzhokhar said that he and his brother were motivated by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups, and that he was following his brother's lead. He said they learned to build explosive devices from the [[Inspire (magazine)|online magazine]] of [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name="AutoLC-8" /> He also said they had intended to travel to New York City to bomb [[Times Square]].

The [[2013 Boston Marathon|117th annual Boston Marathon]] was run on [[Patriots' Day]], April 15, 2013. At {{Nowrap |2:49{{nbsp}}p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]}} {{Nowrap|(18:49 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])}}, two bombs detonated about {{convert|210|yd|m}} apart at the finish line on Boylston Street near [[Copley Square]].<ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /><ref name="globe-investigation-continues" /><ref name="AutoLC-12" /><ref name="CNN_Levs" /> The first exploded outside [[Marathon Sports (retailer)|Marathon Sports]] at 671–673 Boylston Street at 2:49:43{{nbsp}}p.m.<ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /> At the time of the first explosion, the race clock at the finish line showed 04:09:43<ref name="AutoLC-13" />{{snd}}the elapsed time since the Wave 3 start at 10:40{{nbsp}}a.m. The second bomb exploded at 2:49:57{{nbsp}}p.m.,<ref name="globe-investigation-continues" /><ref name="NBCNews" /> 14 seconds later and one block farther west at 755 [[Boylston Street]].<ref name="cnn-what-we-know" /> The explosions took place nearly three hours after the winning runner crossed the finish line,<ref name="NBCNews" /> but with more than 5,700 runners yet to finish.<ref name="AutoLC-11" />

Windows on adjacent buildings were blown out, but there was no structural damage.<ref name="NBCNews" /><ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /> Runners continued to cross the line until 2:57{{nbsp}}p.m.<ref name="AutoLC-14" />

== Casualties and initial response ==
Rescue workers and medical personnel, on hand as usual for the marathon, gave aid as additional police, fire, and medical units were dispatched,<ref name="AutoLC-29" /><ref name="AutoLC-30" /> including from surrounding cities as well as private ambulances from all over the state. The explosions killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others, who were treated at 27 local hospitals. At least 14 people required amputations, with some suffering [[traumatic amputation]]s as a direct result of the blasts.<ref name="globe-number-injured" />

Police, following emergency plans, diverted arriving runners to [[Boston Common]] and [[Kenmore Square]]. The nearby [[The Lenox Hotel|Lenox Hotel]] and other buildings were evacuated.<ref name="CNN_Levs" /> Police closed a 15-block area around the blast site; this was reduced to a 12-block crime scene on April 16.<ref name="CNN_Levs" /><ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /><ref name="Reuters_McLaughlin" /> Boston police commissioner [[Edward F. Davis]] recommended that people stay off the streets.<ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" />

Dropped bags and packages, abandoned as their owners fled from the blasts,  increased uncertainty as to the possible presence of more bombs<ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /><ref name="AutoLC-31" /> and many false reports were received.<ref name="Clark Estes" /><ref name="CNN_Levs" /><ref name="AutoLC-32" /><ref name="Fox News1" /><ref name="Levitz" /><ref name="Hines" /><ref name="AutoLC-33" /> An unrelated electrical fire at the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|John F. Kennedy Presidential Library]] in nearby [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] was initially feared to be a bomb.

[[File:2013 Boston Marathon explosions aftermath emergency services.jpg|thumb|right|Emergency services at work after the bombing]]
The airspace over Boston was restricted, and departures halted from Boston's [[Logan International Airport]].<ref name="AutoLC-35" /> Some local transit service was halted as well.<ref name="NBCNews" />

The [[Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency]] suggested people trying to contact those in the vicinity use text messaging instead of voice calls because of crowded cellphone lines.<ref name="NBCNews" /> Cellphone service in Boston was congested but remained in operation, despite some local media reports stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators.<ref name="Sullivan" />

The [[American Red Cross]] helped concerned friends and family receive information about runners and casualties.<ref name="AutoLC-37" /><ref name="ARC" /> The [[Boston Police Department]] also set up a helpline for people concerned about relatives or acquaintances to contact and a line for people to provide information.<ref name="AutoLC-38" /> [[Google Person Finder]] activated their disaster service under ''Boston Marathon Explosions'' to log known information about missing people as a publicly viewable file.<ref name="AutoLC-39" />

Due to the closure of several hotels near the blast zone, a number of visitors were left with nowhere to stay; many Boston-area residents opened their homes to them.<ref name="AutoLC-40" />

== Investigation ==
[[File:Pressure cooker bomb.jpg|thumb|This pressure cooker fragment was part of one of the explosive devices.]]
The Federal Bureau of Investigation led the investigation, assisted by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[National Counterterrorism Center]], and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].<ref name="Hosenball" /> It was initially believed by some that [[North Korea]] was behind the attack after escalating tensions and threats with the U.S.<ref>http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-blamed-for-boston-bombings-2013-4?IR=T</ref><ref>http://www.ibtimes.com/north-korea-denies-any-link-boston-marathon-bombs-says-it-still-may-strike-us-1211721</ref>

United States government officials stated that there had been no intelligence reports suggesting such an attack. Representative [[Peter T. King|Peter King]], a member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]], said: "I received two top secret briefings last week on the current threat levels in the United States, and there was no evidence of this at all."<ref name="AutoLC-46" />

After being identified, the father of the two suspects claimed that the FBI had been watching his family. He stated that they visited his sons' home in Cambridge, Massachusetts five times, most recently in 2011, as "preventive work... afraid there might be some explosions on the streets of Boston."<ref name="AutoLC-47" />

[[File:Tsarnaev Fireworks.jpg|thumb|right|Emptied fireworks from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's backpack, found in a landfill near the UMass Dartmouth campus]]
Evidence found near the blast sites included bits of metal, nails, ball bearings,<ref name="McLaughlin" /> black nylon pieces from a backpack,<ref name="AutoLC-131" /> remains of an electronic circuit board, and wiring.<ref name="McLaughlin" /><ref name="Lister" /> A [[pressure cooker]] lid was found on a nearby rooftop.<ref name="AutoLC-49" /> Both of the [[improvised explosive device]]s were [[pressure cooker bomb]]s manufactured by the bombers.<ref name="abc-pressure-cooker" /><ref name="AutoLC-50" /><ref name="AutoLC-51" /> Authorities confirmed that the brothers used bomb-making instructions found in [[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]]'s ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'' magazine.<ref name="Auto9P-1" /><ref name="la-times-suspect-describes-plot" /> After the suspects were identified, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that Tamerlan purchased [[fireworks]] from a fireworks store in [[New Hampshire]].<ref name="AutoQU-2" />

On April 19, the FBI, [[West New York]] Police Department, and [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] Sheriff's Department seized computer equipment from the apartment of the Tsarnaevs' sister in West New York, New Jersey.<ref name="AutoLC-52" /> On April 24, investigators reported that they had reconstructed the bombs, and believed that they had been triggered by remote controls used for toy cars.<ref name="la-times-bombs-triggered" />

=== Release of suspect photos ===
[[Jeff Bauman]] was immediately adjacent to one of the bombs and lost both legs; he wrote while in the hospital: "Bag, saw the guy, looked right at me".<ref name="Bauman evidence" /> He later gave a detailed description of the suspects, which enabled images of them to be identified and circulated quickly.<ref name="Bauman evidence" /><ref name="AutoLC-53" /><ref name="AutoLC-54" />

At 5:20{{nbsp}}p.m. on April 18, the FBI released images of two suspects carrying backpacks, asking the public's help in identifying them.<ref name="FBI18AprSuspectPics" /><ref name="FBI plea" /> The FBI said that they were doing this in part to limit harm to people wrongly identified by news reports and on social-media.<ref name="AutoLC-175" />
As seen on video, the suspects stayed to observe the chaos after the explosions, then walked away casually. The public sent authorities a deluge of photographs and videos, which were scrutinized by both authorities and online public social networks.<ref name="FBI plea" />

=== MIT shooting and carjacking ===
[[File:Scenes and approximate times of events of April 18-19.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|left|Scenes and approximate times of events of April 18–19]]
A few hours after the photos were released, the Tsarnaev brothers ambushed and shot Sean A. Collier of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department]] six times<ref name="admits" /> in an attempt to steal his [[Smith & Wesson M&P|Smith & Wesson M&P45]] sidearm, which they could not free from his holster because of its retention system.<ref>{{cite news|date=April 23, 2013|title=Police believe Tsarnaev brothers killed officer for his gun|publisher=CBS News|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-believe-tsarnaev-brothers-killed-officer-for-his-gun/|access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref> Collier, aged 27, was seated in his police car near the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Building 32]] on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus.<ref name="NY Times Standoff" /><ref name="lowery" /> He died soon after.<ref name="NY Times Standoff" /><ref name="AutoLC-58" />

The brothers then carjacked a [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] [[SUV]] in the [[Allston-Brighton]] neighborhood of Boston. Tamerlan took the owner, Chinese national Dun "Danny" Meng<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boston-marathon-bombing-jurors-see-dramatic-video-of-carjack-victims-escape/|title=Boston bombing jurors see dramatic video of carjack victim's escape|agency=CBS/[[Associated Press|AP]] | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=March 12, 2015|access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref> ({{zh|c=孟盾}}),<ref>Chinese name from: {{cite news|url=http://ny.uschinapress.com/weekends/2017/01-13/111620.html|title=《爱国者日》上映 再现波马爆炸案 留学生孟盾事迹搬...|newspaper=[[The China Press]]|date=January 13, 2017|access-date=September 22, 2018}}</ref> hostage and told him that he was responsible for the Boston bombing and for killing a police officer.<ref name="NY Times Standoff" /> Dzhokhar followed them in their green [[Honda Civic]], later joining them in the Mercedes-Benz. Interrogation later revealed that the brothers "decided spontaneously" that they wanted to go to New York and bomb [[Times Square]].<ref name=Gorman />

The Tsarnaev brothers forced Meng to use his ATM cards to obtain $800 in cash.<ref name="AutoLC-60" /><ref name="WashPost04192013" /> They transferred objects to the Mercedes-Benz and one brother followed it in their Civic,<ref name="wsjdetails" /> for which an [[all-points bulletin]] was issued.

=== Watertown shootout ===
Shortly after midnight on April 19, Watertown police officer Joseph Reynolds identified the brothers in the [[Honda]] and the stolen Mercedes after overhearing radio traffic that the vehicle was "pinged" by Cambridge officers on Dexter Ave. in Watertown. Reynolds followed the vehicle while waiting for additional units to perform a high-risk traffic stop when the suspect vehicles both turned onto Laurel St. and stopped. 

Tamerlan Tsarnaev stepped out of his vehicle and immediately opened fire on Officer Reynolds and Sergeant John MacLellan, who both returned fire and requested emergency assistance over their radios. A violent gun battle ensued between Tsarnaev, the aforementioned officers, and subsequent additional police responding to the "shots fired" radio transmissions from Reynolds and MacLellan in the 100 block of Laurel St.<ref name="NY Times Standoff" /><ref name="captured" /><ref name="Watertown firefight, Globe" /> An estimated 200 to 300 rounds of ammunition were fired, 56 of which were later determined to have been fired from the suspects, and at least one pressure cooker bomb and several "crude grenades" were thrown.<ref name="Watertown firefight, Globe" /><ref name="AutoLC-65" /> 

The agencies involved in the nearly 7-minute long shootout included the Watertown Police Department, [[Cambridge Police Department]], [[Boston Police Department]], [[Massachusetts State Police]] (MSP), [[Boston University]] Police Department, and MBTA Transit Police Department. The majority of the officers involved in the shootout were equipped by their respective agencies with either the [[Glock 22]] or [[Glock 23]] [[.40 S&W]]-caliber pistols. MSP troopers were armed with [[Smith & Wesson M&P|Smith & Wesson M&P45]] pistols chambered in [[.45 ACP]]; this lead investigators to match the [[9mm]] casings and projectiles found at the scene to be matched to the suspects' 9mm [[Ruger P95]] pistol.

According to Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau, the brothers had an "arsenal of guns."<ref name="Tucson Citizen" /> Tamerlan eventually ran out of ammunition and threw his empty Ruger pistol at Watertown PD Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, who subsequently tackled him with assistance from Sergeant MacLellan.<ref name="DeWitt2013">{{cite news|last1=DeWitt|first1=Vincent|title=Watertown Mass.

On the evening of April 19, two hours after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted, David Henneberry, a Watertown resident outside the search area, noticed that the tarp was loose on his parked boat.<ref name="AutoLC-83" /><ref name="BBCboat" /> Investigating, he saw a body lying inside the boat in a pool of blood.<ref name="AutoLC-84" /> He contacted the authorities, who surrounded the boat.

According to Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis and Watertown Police Chief Deveau, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was shooting at police from inside the boat, "exchanging fire for an hour".<ref name="USA Today">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/19/suspect-in-custody-newspaper-says/2095845/ |access-date=April 20, 2013 |title=As manhunt ends, new questions emerge in Boston bombings |author=Johnson, Kevin |work=USA Today |date=April 20, 2013}}</ref> A subsequent report indicated that the firing lasted for a shorter time.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/officials-boston-suspect-had-no-firearm-when-barrage-of-bullets-hit-hiding-place/2013/04/24/376fc8a0-ad18-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story.html|title=Officials: Boston suspect had no firearm when barrage of bullets hit hiding place|first1=Sari|last1=Horwitz|first2=Peter|last2=Finn|date=April 24, 2013|access-date=October 15, 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref> Despite this, the suspect was found to have no weapon when he was captured.<ref name="AutoLC-87" />

== Legal proceedings ==

=== Interrogation ===
United States Senators [[Kelly Ayotte]], [[Saxby Chambliss]], [[Lindsey Graham]], and [[John McCain]], and Representative [[Peter T. King]] suggested that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, should be tried as an [[unlawful combatant|unlawful enemy combatant]] rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining [[Assistance of Counsel Clause|legal counsel]].<ref name="AutoLC-91" /><ref name="AutoLC-92" /> Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]], and would jeopardize the prosecution.<ref name="AutoLC-93" /><ref name="AutoLC-94" /> The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant.<ref name="CNN220130423" />

Dzhokhar was questioned for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating with them on the night of April 22 after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a [[Miranda warning]].<ref name="Gorman" /><ref name="AutoLC-103" /> Dzhokhar had not previously been given a Miranda warning, as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's [[public safety exception]].<ref name="AutoLC-90" /> This raised doubts whether his statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights.<ref><!-- this article's misspelling of "Dzhokhar" is [sic] -->{{cite news|title=The Right to Remain Silent: Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the Public Safety Exception, and Miranda in a post-911 World|url=http://www.marathonlawdenver.com/2013/04/22/dzokharpublicsafetyexceptionmiranda/|newspaper=Marathon Law|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613153900/http://www.marathonlawdenver.com/2013/04/22/dzokharpublicsafetyexceptionmiranda/|date=April 22, 2013|archive-date=June 13, 2013|access-date=April 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Andrew|title=Tsarnaev Without Tears: The Legal Way Forward|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/tsarnaev-without-tears-the-legal-way-forward/275160/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=April 20, 2013 |access-date= April 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|title=Why Should I Care That No One's Reading Dzhokhar Tsarnaev His Miranda Rights?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/04/dzhokhar_tsarnaev_and_miranda_rights_the_public_safety_exception_and_terrorism.html|newspaper=Slate|date=April 19, 2013 |access-date= April 11, 2015}}</ref>

{{Main|Trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev}}

Jury selection began on January 5, 2015, and was completed on March 3, with a jury consisting of eight men and ten women (including six alternates).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/02/20/opening-statements-tsarnaev-trial-could-begin-early-march-official-says/4TZWH4KMZY2nXaHLPywTMN/story.html|title=Opening statements in Tsarnaev trial could begin in early March, official says – Metro – The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=April 8, 2015}}</ref> The trial began on March 4 with Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb describing the bombing and painting Dzhokhar as "a soldier in a [[Jihad|holy war]] against [[Americans]]" whose motive was "reaching [[Jannah|paradise]]".

On July 30, 2020, Tsarnaev's death sentence was reversed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]], which found that the District Court did not properly screen jurors on how much they had heard of the case during jury selection. The First Circuit vacated the death sentence and three of the other thirty convictions against Tsarnaev, and ordered a new penalty phase jury trial with fresh jurors, leaving the decision of a new change of venue to the District Court. Tsarnaev's remaining convictions still carried multiple life sentences, assuring that he would remain in prison regardless of the results of the new trial.<ref name="cnn appeal july312020">{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/31/us/boston-marathon-bomber-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-sentence-vacated/index.html | title = Appeals court vacates Boston Marathon bomber's death sentence, orders new penalty trial | first = Sonia | last = Monge | date = July 31, 2020 | access-date = August 1, 2020 | work = [[CNN]] }}</ref>

== Motives and backgrounds of the Tsarnaev brothers ==

=== Motives ===
According to FBI interrogators, Dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by Islamic beliefs but "were not connected to any known terrorist groups", instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by [[al-Qaeda]] affiliates in Yemen.<ref name="AutoLC-8" /> They further alleged that "Dzhokhar and his brother considered suicide attacks and striking [the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular] on the Fourth of July";<ref>{{cite news|title=Boston Plotters Said to Initially Target July 4 for Attack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/us/Boston-bombing-suspects-planned-july-fourth-attack.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 2, 2013 |access-date= April 11, 2015|first1=Eric|last1=Schmitt|first2=Mark|last2=Mazzetti|first3=Michael S.|last3=Schmidt|first4=Scott|last4=Shane}}</ref> but ultimately decided to use remotely-activated pressure cooker bombs and other IEDs.

=== People detained and released ===
On April 15, several people who were near the scene of the blast were taken into custody and questioned about the bombing, including a Saudi man whom police stopped as he was walking away from the explosion; they detained him when some of his responses made them uncomfortable.<ref name="AutoLC-120" /><ref name="AutoLC-121" /><ref name="Hunter" /><ref name="AutoLC-122" /> Law enforcement searched his residence in a Boston suburb, and the man was found to have no connection to the attack.

On the night of April 18, two men who were riding in a taxi in the vicinity of the shootout were arrested and released shortly thereafter when police determined that they were not involved in the Marathon attacks.<ref name="AutoLC-124" /> Another man was arrested several blocks from the site of the shootout and was forced to [[Strip search|strip naked]] by police who feared that he might have concealed explosives.

=== Dias Kadyrbayev, Azamat Tazhayakov, and Robel Phillipos ===

==== Personal backgrounds ====
Robel Phillipos (19) was a U.S. citizen of [[Ethiopian American|Ethiopian descent]] living in Cambridge who was arrested and faced with charges of knowingly [[making false statements]] to police.<ref name="businessinsider" /><ref name="USA.Friend">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/01/boston-marathon-bombings-tsarnaev-phillipos/2127469/|title=Bomb suspect's friend Robel Phillipos: Who is he?|last=Winter|first=Michael|date=May 1, 2013|work=[[USA Today]] | access-date=January 2, 2015}}</ref> He graduated from high school in 2011 with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.<ref name="Auto9P-6" />
Dias Kadyrbayev (19) and Azamat Tazhayakov (20) were natives of [[Kazakhstan]] living in the U.S.<ref name="AutoLC-127" /><ref name="AutoQU-10" /> They were Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's roommates in an off-campus housing complex in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], at which Tsarnaev had sometimes stayed.<ref name="businessinsider" />

Phillipos, Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov, and Tsarnaev entered the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] in the fall of 2011 and knew each other well. After seeing photos of Tsarnaev on television, the three men traveled to his dorm room where they retrieved a backpack and laptop belonging to Tsarnaev. The backpack was discarded, but police recovered it and its contents in a nearby New Bedford landfill on April 26. During interviews, the men initially denied visiting the dorm room but later admitted their actions.<ref name="businessinsider" /><ref name="usatoday" />

==== Arrests and legal proceedings ====
Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were arrested by police at the off-campus housing complex during the night of April 18–19. An unidentified girlfriend of one of the men was also arrested,<ref name="AutoLC-127" /><ref name="AutoQU-10" /> but all three were soon released.<ref name="businessinsider" />

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were re-arrested in New Bedford on April 20 and held on immigration-related violations. They appeared before a federal [[immigration judge]] on May 1 and were charged with overstaying their [[student visa]]s.<ref name="AutoQU-11" /><ref name="AutoLC-129" /><ref name="AutoLC-130" /> That same day, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were charged criminally with:

{{Quote |willfully conspir(ing) with each other to commit an offense against the United States… by knowingly destroying, concealing, and covering up objects belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, namely, a backpack containing fireworks and a laptop computer, with the intent to impede, obstruct, and influence the criminal investigation of the Marathon bombing.<ref name="AutoQU-12" /><ref name="AutoQU-13" />}}

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were indicted by a [[Grand juries in the United States|federal grand jury]] on August 8, 2013, on charges of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to [[Obstruction of justice|obstruct justice]] for helping Dzhokhar Tsarnaev dispose of a laptop computer, fireworks, and a backpack after the bombing.

Tazhayakov pleaded not guilty and went to trial, arguing that "Kadyrbayev was the mastermind behind destroying the evidence and that Tazhayakov only 'attempted obstruction.'" Jurors returned a guilty verdict against him, however, and he was sentenced to 42 months in prison in June 2015, which equated to three and a half years.

{{See also|Carmen Ortiz#Boston Marathon bombings}}
A federal indictment was unsealed against Khairullozhon Matanov on May 30, 2014, charging him with "one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation." Matanov bought dinner for the two Tsarnaev brothers 40 minutes after the bombing.  After the Tsarnaev brothers' photos were released to the public, Matanov viewed the photos on the CNN and FBI websites before attempting to reach Dzhokhar, and then tried to give away his cell phone and delete hundreds of documents from his computer. Prosecutors said that Matanov attempted to mislead investigators about the nature of his relationship with the brothers and to conceal that he shared their philosophy of violence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/30/justice/boston-marathon-bombings-charges/|title=Massachusetts man charged with obstructing Boston bombings probe|first=Jason|last=Hanna|first2=Mariano|last2=Castillo|date=May 30, 2014|work=CNN|access-date=April 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name="LySentenceJune">{{cite news|first=Laura|last=Ly|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/18/us/tsarnaev-friend-sentence/|title=Friend of Boston marathon bombers gets 30-month sentence|work=CNN|date=June 18, 2015}}</ref>

One study conducted by the Institute for Public Service at [[Suffolk University]] in Boston, Massachusetts, records the mental health and emotional response of various survivors, for three years following the bombing. In doing so, it reviews the kinds of aid that were available in local hospitals and gives advice as to how a person or community may be healed.<ref>The mental health response to the Boston bombing: A three-year review</ref>

This study also mentions that after realizing the under coverage of people in the city being killed or injured on a daily basis, the city of Boston "applied for and received a grant from The Rockefeller Foundation to be part of their 100 resilient cities network and to develop a cross cutting resilience strategy".

However, there was rising [[anti-Muslim sentiment]] online and locally in the weeks following the bombing, causing distress in the local [[Muslim]] community and leaving some afraid of going out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bhattacharyya|first1=Sriya|last2=Ashby|first2=Kimberly M.|last3=Goodman|first3=Lisa A.|title=Social Justice Beyond the Classroom|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|date=September 26, 2014|volume=42|issue=8|pages=1136–1158|doi=10.1177/0011000014551420}}</ref>

A monument memorializing the victims was completed at the bombing site on August 19, 2019.<ref name=":0" />

=== National reaction ===
President [[Barack Obama]] addressed the nation after the attack.<ref name="AutoLC-137" /> He said that the perpetrators were still unknown, but that the government would "get to the bottom of this" and that those responsible "will feel the full weight of justice".<ref name="AutoLC-138"/> He ordered flags to half-staff until April 20 on all federal buildings as "a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts."<ref name="AutoLC-140" />

Moments of silence were held at various events across the country, including at the openings of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], [[NASDAQ]], and [[New York Mercantile Exchange|NYMEX]] on the day after the bombing.<ref name="Mills" /> Numerous special events were held, including marathons and other runs.<ref name="AutoLC-142" /><ref name="AutoLC-143" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20130421/NEWS06/304210177/lansing-marathon-boston-bombing|title=Lansing Marathon runners hit the street to salute Boston|work=Detroit Free Press|access-date=April 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onerunforboston.org|title=One Run For Boston 2|work=One Run for Boston|access-date=April 8, 2015}}</ref>

=== International reactions ===
[[File:US flag flying at half mast in Milan, 2013.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|Flag flying at half staff at the American consulate in [[Milan]], Italy]]
The bombing was denounced and condolences were offered by many international leaders as well as leading figures from international sport. Security measures were increased worldwide in the wake of the attack.<ref name="oregon" /><ref name="AutoLC-144" /><ref name="telegraph_wl" /><ref name="SI_1" />

In China, users posted condolence messages on [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]] in response to the death of Lü Lingzi.<ref name="newyorkFan" /> Chris Buckley of ''The New York Times'' said "Ms. Lu's death gave a melancholy face to the attraction that America and its colleges exert over many young Chinese."<ref name="Buckley" /> Laurie Burkitt of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said "Ms. Lu's death resonates with many in China" due to the [[one-child policy]].<ref name="AutoLC-146" />

Organizers of the [[2013 London Marathon|London Marathon]], which was held six days after the Boston bombing, reviewed security arrangements for their event. Hundreds of extra police officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, and a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets. Runners in London observed a 30-second silence in respect for the victims of Boston shortly before the race began, and many runners wore black ribbons on their vests. Organizers also pledged to donate US$3 to a fund for Boston Marathon victims for every person who finished the race.<ref name="Katz" /><ref name="AutoLC-147" /><ref name="AutoLC-148" />

Organizers of the 2013 [[Vancouver Sun Run]], which was held on April 21, 2013, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Jamie Pitblado, vice-president of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province, said the money would go to One Fund Boston, an official charity that collected donations for the victims and their families. Sun Run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. There were over 48,000 participants, many dressed in blue and yellow (Boston colors) with others wearing Boston Red Sox caps.<ref name="Auto9P-8" />

[[Petr Gandalovic]], ambassador of the Czech Republic, released a statement after noticing much confusion on Facebook and Twitter between his nation and the Chechen Republic. "The Czech Republic and Chechnya are two very different entities – the Czech Republic is a Central European country; Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation."<ref name="AutoLC-152" />

Security was also stepped up in Singapore in response to online threats made on attacking several locations in the city-state and the Singapore Marathon in December. Two suspects were investigated and one was eventually arrested for making false bomb threats.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/singapore-hit-by-bomb-hoaxes-after-boston-attacks/ |title= Singapore Hit By Bomb Hoaxes After Boston Attacks |access-date= April 11, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140305220307/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/singapore-hit-by-bomb-hoaxes-after-boston-attacks/ |archive-date= March 5, 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

==== Russian reaction ====
The [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] said that special attention would be paid to security at upcoming international sports events in Russia, including the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].<ref name="AutoLC-149" /> According to the Russian embassy in the U.S., President [[Vladimir Putin]] condemned the bombing as a "barbaric crime" and "stressed that the Russian Federation will be ready, if necessary, to assist in the U.S. authorities' investigation."<ref name="AutoLC-150" /> He urged closer cooperation of security services with Western partners<ref name="AutoLC-151" /> but other Russian authorities and mass media blamed the U.S. authorities for negligence as they warned the U.S. of the Tsarnaevs.<ref name="Russia-could">{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2013/04/26/mnenie-site.html |script-title = ru:Россия могла предотвратить теракт в Бостоне |trans-title=Russia could have prevented a terrorist attack in Boston|author=Shestakov, Yevgeny|work=Rossiyskaya Gazeta|date=April 26, 2013|access-date= April 11, 2015|language=ru}}</ref> Moreover Russian authorities and mass media since the spring of 2014 blame the United States for politically motivated false information about the lack of response from Russian authorities after subsequent U.S. requests.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} As proof a letter from the Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) was shown to the members of an official U.S. Congressional delegation to Moscow during their visit.

Republican U.S. Senators [[Saxby Chambliss]] and [[Richard Burr]] reported that Russian authorities had separately asked both the FBI (at least twice: during March and November 2011) and the CIA (September 2011) to look carefully into Tamerlan Tsarnaev and provide more information about him back to Russia.<ref name="BG-RUS">{{cite web|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/04/23/russia-contacted-fbi-multiple-times-concerns-about-alleged-boston-marathon-bomber/ND0bhUdq1Tp1mRuC8xlb8N/story.html|title= Russia contacted US government 'multiple' times|author1= Bender, Bryan|author2= Bierman, Noah|work= The Boston Globe|date= April 23, 2013|access-date= March 27, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170613234646/http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/04/23/russia-contacted-fbi-multiple-times-concerns-about-alleged-boston-marathon-bomber/ND0bhUdq1Tp1mRuC8xlb8N/story.html|archive-date= June 13, 2017|url-status= dead}}</ref> Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) secretly recorded phone conversations between [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]] and his mother (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the FBI as evidence of possible extremist links within the family.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} However, while Russia offered US intelligence services warnings that Tsarnaev planned to link up with extremist groups abroad, an FBI investigation yielded no evidence to support those claims at the time.

==== Chechen reactions ====
On April 19, 2013, the press-secretary of the [[head of the Chechen Republic]], [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], issued a statement that, inter alia, read: "The Boston bombing suspects have nothing to do with Chechnya".<ref name="AutoLC-153" /><ref name="AutoLC-154" /> On the same day, Kadyrov was reported by ''[[The Guardian]]'' to have written on [[Instagram]]:<ref name="AutoLC-155" />

<blockquote>Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain. They grew up in the U.S., their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America. The whole world must battle with terrorism. We know this better than anyone. We wish recover {{sic}} to all the victims and share Americans' feeling of sorrow.</blockquote>

[[Akhmed Zakayev]], head of the secular wing of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen separatist movement]], now in exile in London, condemned the bombing as "terrorist" and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. Zakayev denied that the bombers were in any way representative of the Chechen people, saying that "the Chechen people never had and can not have any hostile feelings toward the United States and its citizens."<ref name="AutoLC-156" />

The [[Caucasus Emirate|Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province of Dagestan]], the [[North Caucasian Federal District|Caucasian]] Islamist organization in both Chechnya and Dagestan, denied any link to the bombing or the Tsarnaev brothers and stated that it was at war with Russia, not the United States. It also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since 2012.<ref name="AutoLC-157" /><ref name="AutoLC-158" /><ref name="AutoLC-159" />

=== Criticism of the "shelter-in-place" directive and house-to-house searches ===
During the manhunt for the perpetrators of the bombing, Governor [[Deval Patrick]] said "we are asking people to shelter in place." The request was highly effective; most people stayed home, causing Boston, Watertown, and Cambridge to come to a virtual standstill. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, "media described residents complying with a 'lockdown order,' but in reality the governor's security measure was a request." [[Scott Silliman]], emeritus director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke Law School, said that the shelter-in-place request was voluntary.<ref name="Rawlings">{{cite web|first=Nate|last=Rawlings|url=http://nation.time.com/2013/04/19/was-boston-actually-on-lockdown/|title=Was Boston Actually on Lockdown?|work=Time|date=April 19, 2013}}</ref>

The shelter-in-place directive was criticized by some commentators. Michael Cohen of ''[[The Observer]]'' said that Americans have little experience with daily terrorism compared to some countries and "are more primed to … assume the absolute worst."<ref name="observerCriticalReaction" /> Cohen wrote that it was not the first time dangerous murderers have been on the loose in a large American city (citing [[Christopher Dorner]] in 2013 and the [[Beltway sniper attacks]] in 2002), but noted that "lockdown" measures were not used in those cases.<ref name="observerCriticalReaction" />  Former congressman and presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]], criticized what he described as a "military-style takeover of parts of Boston" during the investigation and wrote that "this unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself."<ref name="RPaul" />

''[[Haaretz]]''{{-'}}s Chemi Salev wrote that "in terms of cost-benefit analysis, from the evil terrorist's point of view, the Boylston Street bombings and their aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph" since the "relatively amateurish" terrorists managed to intimidate a vast number of people and got a maximum amount of publicity.<ref name="Haaretz" /> Responding to Salev in ''The New York Times'', [[Ross Douthat]] commented that the massive manhunt operation might deter other amateur terrorists, but not hard-core terrorists such as [[Mohammed Atta]].<ref name="DouthatNYTimes" /> Douthat argued that out-of-the-ordinary measures can only be used when terrorism itself is out-of-the-ordinary: if attacks started to occur more often, people would not be as willing to comply with shelter-in-place commands, yet once a terrorist has been hunted with such an operation, it is hard to justify why such measures should not be taken the next time.<ref name="DouthatNYTimes" />

The [[National Lawyers Guild]] and some news outlets questioned the constitutionality of the door-to-door searches conducted by law enforcement officers looking for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://archive.boston.com/yourtown/news/watertown/2013/11/lawyers_to_speak_about_unconstitutional_watertown_home_searc.html| author=Jaclyn Reiss| title=Lawyers raising questions about Watertown home searches following Marathon bombings, shootout| newspaper=Boston Globe| date=November 14, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/watertown-door-door-search-bombing-suspects-violation-fourth-140043137.html?ref=gs| author=Liz Klimas| title=Was Watertown's Door-to-Door Search for Bombing Suspects a Violation of the Fourth Amendment?| work=Yahoo News| date=April 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/04/22/the-police-response-to-the-boston-marathon-bombing/| author=Radley Balko| title=Was the police response to the Boston bombing really appropriate?| newspaper=The Washington Post| date=April 22, 2014}}</ref>

=== One Boston Day ===

On the second anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombings, Mayor [[Marty Walsh (politician)|Marty Walsh]] established April 15, the day of the bombings, as an official and permanent holiday called "One Boston Day", dedicated to conducting random acts of kindness and helping others out.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://onebostonday.org| title=One Boston Day| publisher=One Boston Day| date=April 15, 2015}}</ref> Over the past four years, some examples of acts of kindness being done have been donating blood to the American Red Cross, donating food to the Greater Boston Food Bank, opening free admission in places like the [[Museum of Science]] and [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], donating shoes to homeless shelters, and donating to military and veteran charities.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/culture/events/2016/04/14/11-ways-to-participate-in-one-boston-day-on-friday| author=Kristin Toussaint| title=11 ways to participate in One Boston Day| publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners| date=April 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2018/04/13/guide-one-boston-day-2018/| author=Tessa Yannone| title=Your Guide to One Boston Day 2018| magazine=Boston Magazine| date=April 13, 2018}}</ref>

Davis]] gives a [[news conference]] about the bombing on April 15. Governor [[Deval Patrick]] is second from right and Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley is at far left.]]

On the afternoon of the bombing, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital.<ref name="AutoLC-160" /> That evening, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest.<ref name="AutoLC-163" /> The ''Post'' did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody.<ref name="AutoLC-164" /> The day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect.<ref name="AutoLC-165" />

The ''New York Post'' on its April 18 front page showed two men, and said they were being sought by the authorities. The two were not the ones being sought as suspects. They were a 17-year-old boy and his track coach. The boy, from [[Revere, Massachusetts]], turned himself over to the police immediately and was cleared after a 20-minute interview in which they advised him to deactivate his Facebook account.<ref name="AutoLC-169" /><ref name="autogenerated3" /> ''New York Post'' editor [[Col Allan]] stated, "We stand by our story. The image was emailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men, as our story reported. We did not identify them as suspects." The two were implied to be possible suspects via [[crowdsourcing]] on the websites [[Reddit]]<ref name="autogenerated3" /> and [[4chan]].<ref name="Reconsidering the Internet detectives in Boston manhunt on Reddit and 4Chan: the benefits and pitfalls" />

Several other people were mistakenly identified as suspects.<ref name="AutoLC-170" /> Two of those wrongly identified as suspects on Reddit were the 17-year-old track star noted above and [[Sunil Tripathi]], a [[Brown University]] student missing since March.<ref name="AutoLC-171" /><ref name="Missing Brown University student's family dragged into virally fueled false accusation in Boston" /> Tripathi was found dead on April 23 in the [[Providence River]].<ref name="AutoLC-172" />

On April 17, the FBI released the following statement:
{{Quote|Contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate. Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.<ref name="AutoLC-173" /><ref name="AutoLC-174" />}}

The decision to release the photos of the Tsarnaev brothers was made in part to limit damage done to those misidentified on the Internet and by the media, and to address concerns over maintaining control of the manhunt.<ref name="AutoLC-175" />

== Film adaptation ==
A film about the bombing and the subsequent manhunt, ''[[Patriots Day (film)|Patriots Day]]'', was released in December 2016. Another film, ''[[Stronger (film)|Stronger]]'', which chronicles the experience of survivor [[Jeff Bauman]], was released in September 2017.
