==Early life and family==
Sharad Pawar is one of eleven children born to Govindrao Pawar, and his wife, Shardabai Pawar. The ancestors of Govindrao had moved to Baramati from the nearby Satara district. Govindrao had a long career in [[Baramati]] [[Agricultural cooperative|Farmers' Cooperative]] (Sahakari Kharedi Vikri Sangh). He also managed Shahu boarding, a students' hostel, in the 1940s.<ref name="AttwoodAttwood2019">{{cite book|author1=Donald W.

Shardabai Pawar was also elected to the district local board three times between 1937 and 1952.<ref name="Phadnis2009">{{cite book|last1=Phadnis|last2=Chatterji|last3=Gadgil|title=Business Standard Political Profiles of Cabals and Kings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qT7QvviGoJsC&pg=PA23|year=2009|publisher=Business Standard Books|isbn=978-81-905735-4-2|pages=72, 75}}</ref> and also looked after the family farm at Katewadi, ten kilometres from [[Baramati]].

The elder Pawars were keen supporters of education for their children. For his higher education, young Sharad Pawar went to [[Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce]] (BMCC) in Pune. He was an average student but active in student politics. Most of Pawar's  siblings were well educated and successful in their respective professions.<ref name="BakshiSharma1998"/>

Vasantrao, the eldest brother of Pawar and a lawyer, was murdered over a land deal by a man who was suspected to be a hired assassin. [[Pratap Govindrao Pawar|Pratap Pawar]], Sharad Pawar's younger brother, runs the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] daily newspaper ''[[Sakal]]''. Pawar's nephew, [[Ajit Pawar]], is also a politician and serves as the [[Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra]].<ref name="BakshiSharma1998">{{cite book|author1=Shiri Ram Bakshi|author2=Sita Ram Sharma|author3=S.

Rohit started his career by serving on [[District Councils of India|Pune Zila Parishad]]. In October 2019, he was elected to the [[Maharashtra Legislative Assembly|Maharashtra Vidhansabha]] from the Karjat constituency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/politics/after-parth-its-rohit-one-more-son-set-to-rise-in-pawar-dynasty/235214/|title=Rohit Pawar|last=Pawar|first=Rohit|website=Theprint.in|date=15 May 2019}}</ref>

Pawar is married to Pratibha ([[née]] Shinde), daughter of the test cricketer [[Sadashiv Shinde]]. They have one daughter, [[Supriya Sule]], who is married to Sadanand Sule. Supriya currently represents the [[Baramati]] constituency in the [[17th Lok Sabha]].

==Political career==
===Early career===
Pawar's first political act was when as a schoolboy, he organized a protest march for [[Goa liberation movement|Goan Independence]] in Pravaranagar in 1956. At college he was active in student politics. Although his older lawyer brother belonged to [[Peasants and Workers Party of India|Peasant and Worker's Party]], young Pawar preferred the Congress party and joined [[Indian Youth Congress|Youth Congress]] in 1958. He rose to become the president of Poona district youth Congress in 1962. By 1964, he was one of the two secretaries of Maharashtra youth congress and in regular contact with bigwigs of the party.

===1967–1978===
Early in his career, Pawar was regarded as a protege of [[Yashwantrao Chavan]], the most influential politician from Maharashtra at that time.<ref>[http://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&smid=23&pmid=3&id=885 Sharad Pawar – A Short BIO by MNS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727060815/http://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&smid=23&pmid=3&id=885 |date=27 July 2011 }}.

He won the election and represented the constituency on and off for decades. In 1969, when the Congress party split, he opted for the [[Indian National Congress (R)|Congress(R)]] faction of prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]] along with his mentor Yashwantrao Chavan. As the MLA of Baramati in the early 1970s, he was instrumental in building [[Irrigation tank|percolation tanks]] during a [[Famine in India#1972 Maharashtra drought|severe drought in Maharashtra]]. Like most Congress party politicians from rural western Maharashtra, he was also heavily involved in the politics of the local [[Cooperative sugar factories in Maharashtra|cooperative sugar mills]] and other member run [[Cooperative movement in India|cooperatives societies]]. In early 1970s, the then chief minister [[Vasantrao Naik]] had been power for a long time and there was jockeying for succession among different factions of the state Congress party. At that time, looking to the future leadership of the party, Yashwantrao Chavan persuaded Naik to bring Sharad Pawar into his cabinet as state home affairs minister.<ref name="Lele1981">{{cite book|author=Jayant Lele|title=Elite Pluralism and Class Rule: Political development in Maharashtra, India|url=https://archive.org/details/elitepluralismcl0000lele|url-access=registration|date=15 December 1981|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|isbn=978-1-4875-8657-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/elitepluralismcl0000lele/page/176 176], 235}}</ref> Pawar continued as home affairs minister in the 1975-77 government of [[Shankarrao Chavan]], who succeeded Naik as the chief minister.

===1978-1987===
In the [[1977 Indian general election|1977 Lok Sabha elections]], the Congress party, under Indira Gandhi, lost power to the [[Janata Party|Janata Alliance]]. Taking responsibility for the loss of large number of seats in Maharashtra, chief minister [[Shankarrao Chavan]] resigned shortly afterwards and was replaced by [[Vasantdada Patil]]. Later in the year, the Congress party split, with Pawar's mentor, Yashwantrao Chavan joining one faction, [[Indian National Congress (U)|Congress (U)]], and Indira Gandhi leading her own faction, [[Indian National Congress|Congress (I)]]. Pawar himself joined Congress (U). In the state assembly elections held early in 1978, the two Congress parties ran separately but then formed an alliance to keep power under Vasantdada Patil and deny it to Janata Party which emerged as the biggest single party after the election, but without a majority. Pawar served as Minister of Industry and Labour in the Patil government.<ref>{{citation|jstor=4369264|title=Workers' Safety of No Account|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=15|issue=48|pages=2008–2010|last1=Subrahmanyam|first1=K. V.|year=1980}}</ref>

In July 1978, Pawar broke away from the Congress (U) party to form a coalition government with the [[Janata Party]]. In the process, at the age of 38, he became the youngest [[Chief Minister of Maharashtra]].<ref>Palshikar, S., Birmal, N. and Ghotale, V., Centre for Advanced Studies, Dept. of Politics and Public Administration, University of Pune, 2010, CAS Occasional Paper Series: No. 4. page 8 [http://www.unipune.ac.in/dept/mental_moral_and_social_science/politics_and_public_administration/ppa_webfiles/pdf/OccasionalPaper-CAS/Coalition%20_CAS_%20Prof%20Palshikarnewx.pdf]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/west/story/devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-chief-minister-first-bjp-leader-224867-2014-10-28|title=Devendra Fadnavis set to be Maharashtra's 19th CM|last1=MumbaiOctober 28|first1=IndiaToday in|last2=October 29|first2=2014UPDATED|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=8 June 2019|last3=Ist|first3=2014 00:17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/specials/assembly-elections-2014/maharashtra-news/Second-youngest-CMs-daughter-will-be-youngest-resident-of-Varsha/articleshow/44964945.cms|title=Second youngest CM's daughter will be youngest resident of Varsha – Times of India |website=The Times of India|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> This Progressive Democratic Front government was dismissed in February 1980, following [[Indira Gandhi]]'s return to power.

In the 1980 elections [[Indian National Congress#1966-84|Congress (I)]] won the majority in the state assembly, and [[Abdul Rehman Antulay|A.R. Antulay]] took over as chief minister. Pawar took over the Presidency of his [[Indian National Congress (Socialist)]] (Congress(S)) party in 1983. For the first time, he won the [[Lok Sabha]] election from the [[Baramati]] parliamentary constituency in 1984. He also won the state assembly election of March 1985 for Baramati and preferred to return to state politics, and resigned his Lok Sabha seat. Congress (S), won 54 seats out of 288 in the state assembly, and Pawar became the [[leader of the opposition]] of PDF coalition which included the [[BJP]], PWP, and the Janata party.<ref name="unipune.ac.in">Palshikar, S., Birmal, N. and Ghotale, V., Centre for Advanced Studies, Dept. of Politics and Public Administration, University of Pune, 2010 CAS Occasional Paper Series: No. 4. page 10 [http://www.unipune.ac.in/dept/mental_moral_and_social_science/politics_and_public_administration/ppa_webfiles/pdf/OccasionalPaper-CAS/Coalition%20_CAS_%20Prof%20Palshikarnewx.pdf]</ref>

===1987–1990===
His return to Congress (I) in 1987 has been cited as a reason for the rise of the [[Shiv Sena]] at that time.<ref name="unipune.ac.in"/> Pawar had stated at the time, "the need to save the Congress Culture in Maharashtra", as his reason for returning to Congress.  In June 1988, [[Prime Minister of India]] and Congress President [[Rajiv Gandhi]] decided to induct then Maharashtra Chief Minister [[Shankarrao Chavan]] into his Union Cabinet as Finance Minister and Sharad Pawar was chosen to replace Chavan as chief minister. Sharad Pawar had the task of checking the rise of the [[Shiv Sena]] in state politics, which was a potential challenge to the dominance of Congress in the state.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bagaria|first=Amit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJeHDwAAQBAJ&q=pawar&pg=PT156|title=Mr President: Yes, Prime Minister|date=2019-02-12|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-64429-325-6|language=en}}</ref> In the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, Congress won 28 seats out of 48 in Maharashtra. In the state assembly elections of February 1990, the alliance between the [[Shiv Sena]] and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] posed a stiff challenge to Congress. Congress fell short of an absolute majority in the state assembly, winning 141 seats out of 288. Sharad Pawar was sworn in as chief minister again on 4 March 1990 with the support of 12 independent or unaffiliated members of the legislative assembly (MLAs).

===Early 1990s===
During the course of the 1991 election campaign, former [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]] was [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi|assassinated]]. The party elected [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] as the party president. It was expected that the party president would become the prime minister in the event of a Congress victory.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/22/world/assassination-in-india-indians-express-anger-revulsion-and-disbelief.html|title=ASSASSINATION IN INDIA; Indians Express Anger, Revulsion and Disbelief|work=New York Times|accessdate=5 April 2009|date=22 May 1991 | first=Sanjoy | last=Hazarika}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2AMPAAAAIBAJ&pg=4155,3057608&dq=sharad+pawar|title=Gandhi|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=5 April 2009|date=22 May 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/24/world/assassination-india-replacing-dynasty-congress-party-scrambling-deal-with-its.html|title=Assassination in India: Replacing a Dynasty; Congress Party Is Scrambling to Deal With Its Dependence on One Family|work=New York Times|accessdate=5 April 2009|date=24 May 1991 | first=Barbara | last=Crossette}}</ref> However, Pawar at that time had talked about the distinction between party president and prime minister. Also since the Congress contingent from Maharashtra was the largest, Pawar felt he had a legitimate claim for the post of prime minister. However, Pawar eventually decided not to enter the contest, and the [[Indian National Congress#Current structure and composition|Congress Parliamentary Party]] (party MPs) unanimously elected P.V. Narasimha Rao as their leader, and he was sworn in as prime minister on 21 June 1991.<ref name="Sitapati2018">{{cite book|author=Vinay Sitapati|title=The Man who Remade India: A Biography of P.V.

On 26 June 1991, Pawar took over that portfolio, and held it until March 1993. After Pawar's successor in Maharashtra, [[Sudhakarrao Naik]], stepped down after the disastrous handling of the [[Bombay riots]], Rao asked Pawar to serve again as chief minister of the state. Pawar was sworn in as chief minister for his fourth term on 6 March 1993. Almost immediately, Mumbai was rocked by a series of [[1993 Bombay bombings|bomb blasts]], on 12 March 1993. Pawar's response to the blasts attracted controversy. More than a decade later, Pawar admitted that he had "deliberately misled" people following the bombings, by saying that there were "13 and not 12" explosions, and had added the name of a Muslim-dominated locality to show that people from both communities had been affected.<ref name="Pawar">{{cite news|title=To keep the peace, I misled people on '93 blasts: Pawar|work=The Indian Express|location=India|date=12 August 2006|url=http://www.indiaexplained.com/fullstory.php?content_id=10419|accessdate=16 March 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716192416/http://www.indiaexplained.com/fullstory.php?content_id=10419|archivedate=16 July 2010}}</ref> He attempted to justify this deception by claiming that it was a move to prevent communal riots, by falsely portraying that both Hindu and Muslim communities in the city had been affected adversely. He also admitted to lying about evidence recovered and misleading people into believing that it pointed to the [[Tamil Tigers]] as possible suspects.<ref name="Pawar"/>

===Mid-to-late 1990s===
In 1993, the Deputy Commissioner of the [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation]], [[G. R. Khairnar]] made a series of accusations against Pawar for being involved in corruption and protecting criminals.<ref>{{cite news|title=G R Khairnar|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/G-R-Khairnar/articleshow/30881132.cms|work=Times of India|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=10 December 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mhasawade|first=Shashank|title=HC reinstates Khairnar with full benefits|url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19970705/18650923.html|publisher=Indian Expr5, 2011|work=Indian Express|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219125848/http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19970705/18650923.html|archivedate=19 February 2014}}</ref> Though Khairnar could not produce any evidence in support of his claims, it inevitably affected Pawar's popularity. Notable social worker [[Anna Hazare]] started a fast-unto-death to demand the expulsion of 12 officers of the Maharashtra state forest department who had been accused of corruption. The opposition parties accused Pawar's government of trying to shield the corrupt officers.

The [[1994 Gowari stampede]] occurred at [[Nagpur]], during the [[Winter Session of Maharashtra State Assembly|winter session]] of the state assembly, and killed 114 people. [[Nagpur Police]] were trying to disperse almost 50,000 [[Gowari]] and [[Vanjari (caste)|Vanjari]] protesters using [[baton charge]]s but the police created panic and triggered a stampede amongst protesters.<ref name="TIE19981231">{{cite news |title=Dani exonerates Pawar; Govt rejects report |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19981231/36550294.html |date=31 December 1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511073706/http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19981231/36550294.html |archive-date=11 May 2008 |newspaper=[[The Indian Express]] |agency=Express News Service |access-date=12 October 2015}}</ref> Allegations were made that the mishap occurred because welfare minister Madhukarrao Pichad did not meet with the delegation of the Vanjari people in time. Though Pichad, accepting moral responsibility for the mishap, stepped down, this incident was another setback to Sharad Pawar's government.

After 16 years of protest by the [[Namantar Andolan]] (Name-change Movement), the state government finally renamed [[Marathwada University]] as [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University]] on 14 January 1994, the compromise new name being an expansion of the old name (''Namvistar'') rather than a complete change of name (''Namanatar''). As chief minister Mr Sharad Pawar announced few developments in university departments.{{clarify|date=November 2014}}<ref>Damle, J. S. (2001).

New elections to the [[Vidhan Sabha]] were held in 1995. The [[Shiv Sena]]-[[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] coalition was leading Congress in the polls, and there was widespread rebellion in the Congress party. Shiv Sena-BJP won 138 seats while Congress retained only 80 seats in the state assembly. Sharad Pawar had to step down and Shiv Sena leader [[Manohar Joshi]] took over as chief minister on 14 March 1995. Until the Lok Sabha elections of 1996, Sharad Pawar served as the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the state assembly. In the 1996 [[General elections]], Pawar won the Baramati seat in the Lok Sabha and left the state assembly.

In June 1997, Pawar unsuccessfully challenged [[Sitaram Kesri]] for the post of [[President of the Indian National Congress]]. In the mid-term parliamentary elections of 1998, Pawar not only won his constituency, Baramati, but also led Congress to a win by a large majority{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2016}} of Maharashtra Lok Sabha constituencies. Congress was aligned with the [[Republican Party of India (Athvale)]] and [[Samajwadi Party]] for the Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra. The Congress party won 33 Lok Sabha seats outright, and the allied Republican Party of India won 4 more, for a total of 37 out of 48 in the state. Sharad Pawar served as Leader of Opposition in the 12th Lok Sabha.

===Formation of Nationalist Congress Party===
In 1999, after the 12th Lok Sabha was dissolved and elections to the 13th Lok Sabha were called, Pawar, [[P. A. Sangma]], and [[Tariq Anwar (politician)|Tariq Anwar]] demanded that the party needed to propose someone native-born as the prime ministerial candidate and not the Italian-born [[Sonia Gandhi]], who had entered party politics and replaced Kesri as Congress president. In response, the Congress working committee (CWC) expelled the trio for six years from the party.<ref name="Kidwai2011">{{cite book|author=Rasheed Kidwai|title=Sonia: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CobDtBQVGgC&pg=PR9|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341686-9|page=109}}</ref> In response Pawar and Sangma founded the [[Nationalist Congress Party]] in June 1999. despite the falling out, the new party aligned with the Congress party to form a coalition government in Maharashtra after the [[1999 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election|1999 state assembly elections]] to prevent the Shiv Sena-BJP combine from returning to power.<ref>Palshikar, S., Birmal, N. and Ghotale, V., Centre for Advanced Studies, Dept. of Politics and Public Administration, University of Pune, 2010 CAS Occasional Paper Series: No. 4. page 14 [http://www.unipune.ac.in/dept/mental_moral_and_social_science/politics_and_public_administration/ppa_webfiles/pdf/OccasionalPaper-CAS/Coalition%20_CAS_%20Prof%20Palshikarnewx.pdf]</ref> Pawar, however, did not return to state politics and [[Vilasrao Deshmukh]] of Congress was chosen as chief minister, with [[Chagan Bhujbal]] representing the [[Nationalist Congress Party|NCP]] as  deputy chief minister.

===Minister of agriculture in UPA government===

==== Wheat imports ====
In 2007, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] asked for Pawar's resignation after alleging he was involved in a multi-[[crore]] [[Indian rupee]] (INR) scam involving wheat imports. In May 2007, a tender floated by the [[Food Corporation of India]] (FCI) for procurement of wheat was cancelled when the lowest bid received was for 263 [[United States dollar|USD]]/ton. The government subsequently allowed private traders to purchase wheat directly from farmers that year resulting in a paucity of wheat to stock FCI granaries. By July 2007 the shortage at FCI was large enough to require import of wheat at a much higher price of 320–360 USD/ton. Taking advantage of this, traders who had domestically purchased wheat at 900 INR/ton earlier, were now offering the same to FCI at 1,300 INR/ton.<ref>[http://www.dailypioneer.com/indexn12.asp?main_variable=NATION&file_name=nt2%2Etxt&counter_img=2 BJP seeks Pawar's resignation]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811075111/http://www.dailypioneer.com/indexn12.asp?main_variable=NATION&file_name=nt2.txt&counter_img=2 |date=11 August 2007 }} The Pioneer – 13 July 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/13/stories/2007071354361500.htm Wheat import scandalous: BJP].

==== Agricultural produce prices ====
As the Minister of Agriculture, Pawar was consistently accused of colluding in the extreme hike in prices of agricultural produce:

==== Farmer suicides ====
Since the 1990s there had been a high number of farmer suicides in India: in excess of 10,000 per year, and totalling over 200,000 between 1997 and 2010.<ref>[http://www.indiatribune.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5389:every-12-hours-one-farmer-commits-suicide-in-india&catid=106:magazine Every 12 hours, one farmer commits suicide in India].

==== Promotion of endosulfan ====
Even though the pesticide [[endosulfan]] has been banned, India is slow to phase it out. In spite of its known [[Endosulfan#Health effects|negative health effects]], Pawar made a remark that endosulfan is not yet proved dangerous. This remark prompted activist [[Vandana Shiva]] to call him a corrupt minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/04/18/stories/2011041854300700.htm |title=Tamil Nadu News: India should join consensus on Endosulfan ban: Vandana Shiva |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://agrariancrisis.in/2011/06/28/ban-endosulfan/ |title=Indian Agrarian Crisis – Ban Endosulfan |publisher=Agrariancrisis.in |accessdate=26 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426020742/http://agrariancrisis.in/2011/06/28/ban-endosulfan/ |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/article381407.ece |title=Kerala: Ban endosulfan, says Vandana Shiva |publisher=The New Indian Express |date=17 April 2011 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref>

==== Other issues ====
In 2012, Pawar gave up the chairmanship of the Empowered Group of Ministers investigating the [[2G spectrum case]], days after his appointment by the prime minister, fearing that his association with the decision-making process would drag him into the 2G Spectrum controversy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pawar-quits-as-chairman-of-telecom-egom/969590/ | title= Pawar quits as chairman of telecom EGoM| date=3 July 2012}}</ref> In 2011, he also decided to resign from the committee that was reviewing the draft of the anti-corruption [[The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013|Lokpal bill]] after his inclusion in the committee was criticized by the anti-corruption campaigner, [[Anna Hazare]].<ref name="Sardesai2015">{{cite book|author=Rajdeep Sardesai|title=2014: The Election That Changed India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJBuBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT6|date=22 May 2015|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-81-8475-010-2|pages=6–}}</ref>

In January 2012, Pawar announced that he would not contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, in order to make way for younger leadership.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-29/india/30675770_1_ajit-pawar-ncp-leaders-supriya-sule] NCP chief Sharad Pawar to make way for GenNext in 2014</ref> Pawar is at present a member of the [[Rajya Sabha]]. He was elected to the body in April 2014 for a six-year term. He lost his ministerial position when the BJP-led NDA defeated the ruling UPA government, in which Pawar was the minister of agriculture, in the [[2014 Indian general election|general elections of 2014]].<ref name="Wallace2015">{{cite book|author=Paul Wallace|title=India's 2014 Elections: A Modi-led BJP Sweep|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G7aICwAAQBAJ&pg=PA284|date=7 July 2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-93-5150-188-6|page=18}}</ref> Pawar's NCP also lost power in Maharashtra after the [[2014 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election|2014 assembly elections]].

The 2019 Lok Sabha elections were soon followed by elections to the [[2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election|Vidhan Sabha]]a in October 2019. Predictions for the state's ruling BJP–Shiv Sena alliance to win by a large margin led to a steady stream of defections from the NCP to the ruling alliance.Pawar was the star campaigner for the NCP-Congress alliance in the state, addressing as many as 66 public rallies. His speech in pouring rain at a rally in Satara was much commented on. His campaigning during the assembly election was credited with helping not only the NCP but also the leaderless Congress party.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Das |first1=Koustav |title=66 rallies, 54 seats: Sharad Pawar shows how to counter BJP in elections |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/maharashtra-assembly-election/story/66-rallies-54-seats-sharad-pawar-shows-how-to-counter-bjp-in-elections-1612879-2019-10-25 |accessdate=29 January 2020 |work=India Today |issue=October 25, 2019 |date=2019}}</ref> Against predictions, the actual voting left the ruling alliance with fewer seats than in 2014. After the election, Pawar thought that his party would remain in opposition in the new assembly. However, differences between the Shiv Sena and the BJP led to a month of [[2019 Maharashtra political crisis|political drama]], with Pawar and his family playing a pivotal roles. The drama ended with the NCP coming back into power on 28 November 2019, as part of a [[Maha Vikas Aghadi|coalition]] between Shiv Sena, Congress, and the NCP, led by the Shiv Sena chief, [[Uddhav Thackeray]], as the new chief minister of Maharashtra.

==Controversies==

===Criminal links===
In 1992–93, the then Maharashtra Chief Minister [[Sudhakarrao Naik]] made a statement that the state leader of [[Indian National Congress]] party and erstwhile-Chief Minister Pawar, had asked him to "go easy on [[Pappu Kalani]]", a well known criminal-turned-politician.<ref name=fear>{{cite news|title=The F-factor: Kalani certain of clean sweep |author=Gouri Shah |work=[[The Economic Times]] |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/880573.cms |date=11 October 2004 |accessdate=24 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041025171356/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/880573.cms |archivedate=25 October 2004 }}</ref> Shiv Sena chief, [[Bal Thackeray]], later concurred with these allegations.<ref name=express2>

Pawar is also alleged to have close links with the underworld don [[Dawood Ibrahim]]<ref>[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?200790 Pawar's Time Of Reckoning]. www.outlookindia.com. 14 February 1996.

BJP leader [[Eknath Khadse]] alleged that it was Balwa who had applied for environmental clearance for the two projects, a charge that Chordia refuted. Coincidentally, Chordia's Panchshil Pvt.

===Land allotment===
On 27 October 2007, the Bombay High Court served notices to institutions headed by Pawar, [[Ajit Pawar]], and Sadanand Sule (Sharad Pawar's son-in-law), along with a corresponding notice served to the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) on why special privileges were given to Pawar and his family. This was done in consideration of [[Public Interest Litigation]] No. 148 of 2006, filed by Shamsunder Potare alleging that the said 2002 land allocations in [[Pune]] were illegal. The institutions and properties mentioned include:
* Two {{convert|141.15|acre|ha|adj=on}} plots given allotted to Vidya Pratishthan, an educational society headed by Sharad Pawar

In 2010, in the case of tax exemptions of the [[Indian Premier League]] (IPL), Shiv Sena MLA [[Subhash Desai]] alleged that the state cabinet decided in January to impose the tax, before the year's IPL season started, but the decision was not implemented because of NCP chief Pawar's association with the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI).<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Tax-exemptions-for-rich-costs-govt-Rs-4-6L-cr/articleshow/11149543.cms Tax exemptions for rich costs govt Rs 4.6L cr]</ref> Bombay High Court in August 2010 said there was "nothing on record" to show that the Union Minister influenced the Maharashtra government's decision to exempt Indian Premier League matches from entertainment tax.<ref>[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-08-24/news/27613804_1_entertainment-tax-ipl-exemption No proof to show Pawar influenced IPL exemption from tax: HC]</ref>

===Comments on the 2010 Pune bombing===
After the [[2010 Pune bombing]] of German Bakery, Sharad Pawar appeared to take the incident lightly. He said to the reporters, "It is not alright to arrive at a conclusion that the entire Pune city has been targeted. The place where the blast took place is an isolated area", adding "when I was Chief Minister, Mumbai saw 11 simultaneous blasts but everything returned to normal soon."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/9+killed,+foreigners+among+57+injured+in+Pune+bakery+blast/1/83796.html|title=Not alright to say entire Pune targeted, says Pawar|newspaper=India Today, Headlines Today Bureau|date=13 February 2010}}</ref>

===Turban controversy===
In 2018, Pawar asked party members to felicitate him with the pagadi ([[Pagri (turban)|turban]]) of social reformer [[Mahatma Phule]], instead of the usual [[Puneri Pagadi]] worn by [[peshwa]]s (prime ministers) of the [[Maratha Empire]]. In response to criticism that he was trying to stir up anti-[[Brahmin]] sentiment and appeal to [[Dalit]]s, Pawar said that he wasn't rejecting any section of society but honoring his idols Phule, [[Babasaheb Ambedkar]], and [[Shahu of Kolhapur|Shahu Maharaj]].<ref>{{cite news |last=HT Correspondent |title=Pawar clarifies stand on controversial rejection of 'Puneri pagdi', says it was not rejection of any section of society |url=https://m.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pawar-clarifies-stand-on-controversial-rejection-of-puneri-pagdi-says-it-was-not-rejection-of-any-section-of-society/story-wzDkdmAORApkrPaZ3EujpN.html |date=17 June 2018 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |access-date=1 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Amid controversy, NCP chief Sharad Pawar raises 'pagadi' issue again |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/amid-controversy-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-raises-pagadi-issue-again-5220792/ |date=17 June 2018 |newspaper=The Indian Express |agency=Express News Service |access-date=1 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=शाहू फुलेंचा अभिमान म्हणून फुले पगडीचा आग्रह धरला; शरद पवार यांचे स्पष्टीकरण |trans-title=Turban is Meant to Honour Mahatma Phule |url=https://divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-PUN-IFTM-so-the-fule-insist-on-the-turban-sharad-pawars-explanation-5896932-NOR.html |date=17 June 2018 |newspaper=[[D B Corp Ltd.|Dainik Divya Marathi]] |language=Marathi |access-date=1 October 2018}}</ref>
