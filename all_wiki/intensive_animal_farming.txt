==History==
{{further|History of agriculture}}

Intensive animal farming is a relatively recent development in the [[history of agriculture]], and the result of scientific discoveries and technological advances. Innovations from the late 19th century generally parallel developments in [[mass production]] in other industries in the latter part of the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The discovery of [[vitamin]]s and their role in animal [[nutrition]], in the first two decades of the 20th century, led to vitamin supplements, which allowed chickens to be raised indoors.<ref name="John Steele Gordon 1996">[[John Steele Gordon]] (1996) "The Chicken Story", American Heritage, September 1996: 52–67</ref> The discovery of [[antibiotic]]s and [[vaccine]]s facilitated raising livestock in larger numbers by reducing disease. Chemicals developed for use in [[World War II]] gave rise to synthetic [[pesticide]]s. Developments in shipping networks and technology have made long-distance distribution of agricultural produce feasible.

Agricultural production across the world doubled four times between 1820 and 1975 (1820 to 1920; 1920 to 1950; 1950 to 1965; and 1965 to 1975) to feed a global population of one billion human beings in 1800 and 6.5 billion in 2002.<ref name=dominion>Matthew Scully  [https://books.google.com/books/about/Dominion.html?id=4lSplJlgc_sC Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy] Macmillan, 2002</ref>{{rp|29}}  During the same period, the number of people involved in farming dropped as the process became more automated. In the 1930s, 24 percent of the American population worked in agriculture compared to 1.5 percent in 2002; in 1940, each farm worker supplied 11 consumers, whereas in 2002, each worker supplied 90 consumers.<ref name=dominion/>{{rp|29}}

The era of factory farming in Britain began in 1947 when a new [[Agriculture Act 1947|Agriculture Act]] granted subsidies to farmers to encourage greater output by introducing new technology, in order to reduce Britain's reliance on imported meat. The United Nations writes that "intensification of animal production was seen as a way of providing food security."<ref>[http://www.unsystem.org/SCN/archives/scnnews21/ch04.htm#TopOfPage "The History of Factory Farming"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116060714/http://www.unsystem.org/SCN/archives/scnnews21/ch04.htm |date=November 16, 2013 }}, United Nations.</ref> In 1966, the United States, United Kingdom and other industrialized nations, commenced factory farming of beef and dairy cattle and domestic pigs.<ref name="Danielle Nierenburg 2005"/>  From its American and West European heartland, intensive animal farming became globalized in the later years of the 20th century and is still expanding and replacing traditional practices of stock rearing in an increasing number of countries.<ref name="Danielle Nierenburg 2005">{{cite journal | last1 = Nierenburg | first1 = Danielle | year = 2005 | title = Happier Meals: Rethinking the Global Meat Industry | journal = Worldwatch Paper | volume = 171 | page = 5 }}</ref> In 1990 intensive animal farming accounted for 30% of world meat production and by 2005 this had risen to 40%.<ref name="Danielle Nierenburg 2005"/>

==Types==

Intensive farms hold large numbers of animals, typically cows, pigs, turkeys, [[Domestic goose|geese]]<ref>See: "[[Landscape]] with  [[Domestic goose|Goose]]" - [[documentary film]] by [[Włodzimierz Szpak]] (1987)</ref>, or chickens, often indoors, typically at high densities. The aim is to produce large quantities of meat, eggs, or milk at the lowest possible cost. Food is supplied in place. Methods employed to maintain health and improve production may include the use of disinfectants, antimicrobial agents, anthelmintics, hormones and vaccines; protein, mineral and vitamin supplements; frequent health inspections; [[biosecurity]]; and climate-controlled facilities. Physical restraints, e.g. fences or creeps, are used to control movement or actions regarded as undesirable. Breeding programs are used to produce animals more suited to the confined conditions and able to provide a consistent food product.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Eating Animals |date=2010 |publisher=Hachette Book Group USA |author-link= Jonathan Safran Foer |last=Foer |first=Jonathan Safran |isbn=978-0316127165 |oclc=669754727}}</ref>

Intensive production of livestock and poultry is widespread in [[developed nation]]s. For 2002–2003, [[FAO]] estimates of industrial production as a percentage of global production were 7 percent for beef and veal, 0.8 percent for sheep and goat meat, 42 percent for pork, and 67 percent for poultry meat. Industrial production was estimated to account for 39 percent of the sum of global production of these meats and 50 percent of total egg production.<ref>FAO.  2007.

Rome.  511 pp.</ref> In the U.S., according to its [[National Pork Producers Council]], 80 million of its 95 million pigs slaughtered each year are reared in industrial settings.<ref name=dominion/>{{rp|29}}

===Chickens===
{{further|Poultry farming}}
[[File:Battery hens -Bastos, Sao Paulo, Brazil-31March2007.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hens in Brazil]]

The major milestone in 20th century poultry production was the discovery of vitamin D, which made it possible to keep chickens in confinement year-round. Before this, chickens did not thrive during the winter (due to lack of sunlight), and egg production, incubation, and meat production in the off-season were all very difficult, making poultry a seasonal and expensive proposition. Year-round production lowered costs, especially for broilers.<ref>''Poultry Nutrition'', Ray Ewing, Ray Ewing Press, Third Edition, 1947, page 754.</ref> 

At the same time, egg production was increased by scientific breeding. After a few false starts, (such as the Maine Experiment Station's failure at improving egg production) success was shown by Professor Dryden at the Oregon Experiment Station.<ref>Dryden, James. ''Poultry Breeding and Management''. Orange Judd Press, 1916.</ref>

Improvements in production and quality were accompanied by lower labor requirements. In the 1930s through the early 1950s, 1,500 hens provided a full-time job for a farm family in America. In the late 1950s, egg prices had fallen so dramatically that farmers typically tripled the number of hens they kept, putting three hens into what had been a single-bird cage or converting their floor-confinement houses from a single deck of roosts to triple-decker roosts. Not long after this, prices fell still further and large numbers of egg farmers left the business. This fall in profitability was accompanied by a general fall in prices to the consumer, allowing poultry and eggs to lose their status as luxury foods.

Robert Plamondon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plamondon.com|title=Plamondon.com: the home of Robert Plamondon and all his works!|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref> reports that the last family chicken farm in his part of Oregon, Rex Farms, had 30,000 layers and survived into the 1990s. However, the standard laying house of the current operators is around 125,000 hens.

The [[vertical integration]] of the egg and poultry industries was a late development, occurring after all the major technological changes had been in place for years (including the development of modern broiler rearing techniques, the adoption of the [[Cornish cross|Cornish Cross]] broiler, the use of laying cages, etc.).

By the late 1950s, poultry production had changed dramatically. Large farms and packing plants could grow birds by the tens of thousands. Chickens could be sent to [[slaughterhouse]]s for butchering and processing into prepackaged commercial products to be frozen or shipped fresh to markets or wholesalers. Meat-type chickens currently grow to market weight in six to seven weeks, whereas only fifty years ago it took three times as long.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Havenstein | first1 = G.B. | last2 = Ferket | first2 = P.R. | last3 = Qureshi | first3 = M.A. | year = 2003a | title = Growth, livability, and feed conversion of 1957 versus 2001 broilers when fed representative 1957 and 2001 broiler diets | journal = Poult Sci | volume = 82 | issue = 10| pages = 1500–1508 | doi = 10.1093/ps/82.10.1500 | pmid = 14601725 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This is due to genetic selection and nutritional modifications (but not the use of growth hormones, which are illegal for use in poultry in the US<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/meat-and-poultry-labeling-terms/!ut/p/a1/jZHfT4MwEMf_Fh947NrJXDbfCIkRdJCFqF1fTIG2EKEl7eGCf72gccnMprvmHu7u8839KGaYYqb5e6041EbzZorZ8pVsyXK-Dkmcrud3JEqet-lDGJJVdjMCuz-AxL9Qf8YC8p8-vqDBtd2EG4VZx6FCtZYGUyUAce32wjpMpTElclwKGJDkBSBXCQE_hYbnoqm1wrQVfFKVqDN9A3Y4lBAI2zr8gtnxNGQ-vijxs8V9nPgkXfwGTpzrGzh_j3Fh1Zj86292gc791biZFVJYYWe9HdMVQOduPeKRsi_eJldmVpjWI6cklXGA6TGJu_aJfjwGMosQy4f91Sd72nr3/#15|title=Meat and Poultry Labeling Terms|website=USDA Food Safety Information Service}}</ref> and many other countries,  and have no effect). Once a meat consumed only occasionally, the common availability and lower cost has made chicken a common meat product within developed nations. Growing concerns over the [[cholesterol]] content of [[red meat]] in the 1980s and 1990s further resulted in increased consumption of chicken.

Today, eggs are produced on large egg ranches on which environmental parameters are well controlled. Chickens are exposed to artificial light cycles to stimulate egg production year-round. In addition, [[forced molting]] is commonly practiced in the US, in which manipulation of light and food access triggers molting, in order to increase egg size and production. Forced molting is controversial, and is prohibited in the EU.<ref name="Wigley">{{cite web |url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2013/s/salmonella.pdf |publisher=Compassion in World Farming |title=Salmonella |author=Wigley, P. |year=2013 |access-date=March 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216160101/https://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2013/s/salmonella.pdf |archive-date=February 16, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On average, a chicken lays one egg a day, but not on every day of the year. This varies with the breed and time of year. In 1900, average egg production was 83 eggs per hen per year. In 2000, it was well over 300. In the United States, laying hens are butchered after their second egg laying season. In Europe, they are generally butchered after a single season. The laying period begins when the hen is about 18–20 weeks old (depending on breed and season). Males of the egg-type breeds have little commercial value at any age, and all those not used for breeding (roughly fifty percent of all egg-type chickens) are [[Chick culling|killed]] soon after hatching. The old hens also have little commercial value. Thus, the main sources of poultry meat 100 years ago (spring chickens and stewing hens) have both been entirely supplanted by meat-type broiler chickens.

===Pigs===
{{Main|Intensive pig farming}}
[[File:Hog confinement barn interior.jpg|thumb |Pigs confined to a barn in an intensive system, [[Midwestern United States]]]]

Intensive piggeries (or hog lots) are a type of what in America is called a [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation]] (CAFO), specialized for the raising of [[domestic pig]]s up to slaughterweight. In this system, grower pigs are housed indoors in group-housing or straw-lined sheds, whilst pregnant sows are confined in sow stalls ([[gestation crate]]s) and give birth in [[farrowing crate]]s.

The use of sow stalls has resulted in lower production costs and concomitant [[animal welfare]] concerns. Many of the world's largest producers of pigs (such as [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]]) use sow stalls, but some nations (such as the [[United Kingdom|UK]]) and [[U.S. state]]s (such as [[Florida]] and [[Arizona]]) have banned them.

Intensive piggeries are generally large warehouse-like buildings. Indoor pig systems allow the pig's condition to be monitored, ensuring minimum fatalities and increased productivity. Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated. Most domestic pig varieties are susceptible to heat stress, and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves. Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death. Maintaining a more specific temperature within the pig-tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth to feed ratio. In an intensive operation pigs will lack access to a wallow (mud), which is their natural cooling mechanism.  Intensive piggeries control temperature through ventilation or drip water systems (dropping water to cool the system).

Pigs are naturally omnivorous and are generally fed a combination of grains and protein sources (soybeans, or [[meat and bone meal]]). Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown. Alternatively, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry. Pig feed may be bought packaged or mixed on-site. The intensive piggery system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed. The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the close proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as [[antibiotic]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[hormone]]s and other supplements are preemptively administered.

Indoor systems, especially stalls and pens (i.e. ‘dry,’ not straw-lined systems) allow for the easy collection of waste. In an indoor intensive pig farm, manure can be managed through a lagoon system or other waste-management system. However, odor remains a problem which is difficult to manage.

The way animals are housed in intensive systems varies. Breeding sows spend the bulk of their time in sow stalls during pregnancy or farrowing crates, with their litters, until market.

Piglets often receive range of treatments including castration, tail docking to reduce tail biting, teeth clipped (to reduce injuring their mother's nipples, gum disease and prevent later tusk growth) and their ears notched to assist identification. Treatments are usually made without pain killers. Weak [[runt]]s may be slain shortly after birth.

Piglets also may be [[wean]]ed and removed from the sows at between two and five weeks old<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalhogfarmer.com/mag/farming_revisiting_weaning_age |title=Revisiting Weaning Age Trends, Dynamics |date=October 15, 2005}}</ref> and placed in sheds. However, grower pigs – which comprise the bulk of the herd – are usually housed in alternative indoor housing, such as batch pens.  During pregnancy, the use of a stall may be preferred as it facilitates feed-management and growth control. It also prevents pig aggression (e.g. tail biting, ear biting, vulva biting, food stealing). Group pens generally require higher stockmanship skills.  Such pens will usually not contain straw or other material. Alternatively, a straw-lined shed may house a larger group (i.e. not batched) in age groups.

===Cattle===
[[File:Feedlot-1.jpg|left|thumb|Beef [[cattle]] on a [[feedlot]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]]. Such confinement creates more work for the farmer but allows the animals to grow rapidly.]]

Cattle are [[domestication|domesticated]] [[ungulate]]s, a member of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Bovidae]], in the [[subfamily]] [[Bovinae]], and descended from the [[aurochs]] (''[[Bos primigenius]]'').<ref>Bollongino, Ruth & al.

"DNA reveals that cows were almost impossible to domesticate". March 28, 2012. Accessed April 2, 2012</ref> They are raised as livestock for meat (called beef and [[veal]]), [[dairy product]]s (milk), leather and as [[draught animal]]s. As of 2009–2010 it is estimated that there are 1.3–1.4 billion head of cattle in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cattle-today.com/|title=Breeds of Cattle |publisher=Cattle Today|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/07/global-livestock-counts |title=Counting chickens |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |accessdate=June 10, 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Diagram of feedlot system. This can be contrasted with more traditional [[grazing]] systems.]]

The most common interactions with cattle involve daily [[Fodder|feeding]], cleaning and [[milking]]. Many routine husbandry practices involve [[ear tag]]ging, [[Horn (anatomy)|dehorning]], loading, [[Veterinary surgery|medical operations]], vaccinations and [[Cloven hoof|hoof]] care, as well as training for agricultural shows and preparations.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lott | first = Dale F. |author2=Hart, Benjamin L. | title = Applied ethology in a nomadic cattle culture | journal = Applied Animal Ethology | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 309–319 | publisher = Elsevier B.V. | date=  October 1979 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3762(79)90102-0 }}<!--| accessdate =November 7, 2006 --></ref>

Once cattle obtain an entry-level weight, about {{convert|650|lb|kg}}, they are transferred from the range to a [[feedlot]] to be fed a specialized [[animal feed]] which consists of corn byproducts (derived from ethanol production), barley, and other grains as well as alfalfa and [[cottonseed meal]]. The feed also contains premixes composed of microingredients such as vitamins, minerals, chemical preservatives, [[Antibiotic use in livestock|antibiotics]], fermentation products, and other essential ingredients that are purchased from premix companies, usually in sacked form, for blending into commercial rations. Because of the availability of these products, a farmer using their own grain can formulate their own rations and be assured the animals are getting the recommended levels of minerals and vitamins.

There are many potential impacts on human health due to the modern cattle industrial agriculture system. There are concerns surrounding the antibiotics and growth hormones used, increased ''E. coli'' contamination, higher saturated fat contents in the meat because of the feed, and also environmental concerns.<ref>Pollan, Michael. 2002. This Steer's Life. ''The New York Times''. March 31.</ref>

As of 2010, in the U.S. 766,350 producers participate in raising beef. The beef industry is segmented with the bulk of the producers participating in raising beef calves. Beef calves are generally raised in small herds, with over 90% of the herds having less than 100 head of cattle. Fewer producers participate in the finishing phase which often occurs in a [[feedlot]], but nonetheless there are 82,170 feedlots in the United States.<ref>National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Agricultural Statistics Board, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 2010; [http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/USCatSup/USCatSup-12-17-2010.pdf Overview of the United States Cattle Industry]</ref>

===Aquaculture===
{{main|Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture}}
[[File:IMTA cultured mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the Bay of Fundy Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Mytilus edulis|Blue mussels]] cultivated in proximity to [[Salmo salar|Atlantic salmon]] in the [[Bay of Fundy]], Canada]]

Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), also called integrated aquaculture,<ref name="Neori et al. 2004"/> is a practice in which the by-products (wastes) from one species are recycled to become inputs ([[fertilizer]]s, food) for another, making [[aquaculture]] intensive. Fed aquaculture (e.g. fish and [[shrimp]]) is combined with inorganic extractive (e.g. [[seaweed]]) and organic extractive (e.g. [[shellfish]]) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability (biomitigation), economic stability (product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).<ref name="Chopin et al. 2001">{{cite journal | last1 = Chopin | first1 = T | last2 = Buschmann | first2 = AH | last3 = Halling | first3 = C | last4 = Troell | first4 = M | last5 = Kautsky | first5 = N | last6 = Neori | first6 = A | last7 = Kraemer | first7 = GP | last8 = Zertuche-Gonzalez | first8 = JA | last9 = Yarish | first9 = C | last10 = Neefus | first10 = C | year = 2001 | title = Integrating seaweeds into marine aquaculture systems: a key toward sustainability | journal = Journal of Phycology | volume = 37 | issue = 6| pages = 975–986 | doi = 10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.01137.x }}</ref>

The system is multi-trophic as it makes use of [[species]] from different [[trophic level|trophic]] or [[nutritional]] level, unlike traditional aquaculture.<ref name="Chopin 2006">{{cite journal | last1 = Chopin | first1 = T | year = 2006 | title = Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture. What it is, and why you should care... and don't confuse it with polyculture | journal = Northern Aquaculture | volume = 12 | issue = 4| page = 4 }}</ref>

Ideally, the biological and chemical processes in such a system should balance. This is achieved through the appropriate selection and proportions of different species providing different ecosystem functions. The co-cultured species should not just be [[biofilters]], but harvestable crops of commercial value.<ref name="Chopin 2006"/> A working IMTA system should result in greater production for the overall system, based on mutual benefits to the co-cultured species and improved [[ecosystem health]], even if the individual production of some of the species is lower compared to what could be reached in [[monoculture]] practices over a short-term period.<ref name="Neori et al. 2004">{{cite journal | last1 = Neori | first1 = A | last2 = Chopin | first2 = T | last3 = Troell | first3 = M | last4 = Buschmann | first4 = AH | last5 = Kraemer | first5 = GP | last6 = Halling | first6 = C | last7 = Shpigel | first7 = M | last8 = Yarish | first8 = C | year = 2004 | title = Integrated aquaculture: rationale, evolution and state of the art emphasizing seaweed biofiltration in modern mariculture | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 231 | issue = 1–4| pages = 361–391 | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.11.015 }}</ref>

==Regulation==
{{main|Animal law}}

In various jurisdictions, intensive animal production of some kinds is subject to regulation for environmental protection. In the United States, a [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation]] (CAFO) that discharges or proposes to discharge waste requires a permit and implementation of a plan for management of manure nutrients, contaminants, wastewater, etc., as applicable, to meet requirements pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act.<ref name=CAFOCDCP>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061021104950/https://www.cdc.gov/cafos/about.htm "Concentrated animal feeding operations"], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Health and Human Services.</ref><ref>US Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 122.42(e)</ref>  Some data on regulatory compliance and enforcement are available. In 2000, the US Environmental Protection Agency published 5-year and 1-year data on environmental performance of 32 industries, with data for the livestock industry being derived mostly from inspections of CAFOs.  The data pertain to inspections and enforcement mostly under the Clean Water Act, but also under the Clean Air Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Of the 32 industries, livestock production was among the top seven for environmental performance over the 5-year period, and was one of the top two in the final year of that period, where good environmental performance is indicated by a low ratio of enforcement orders to inspections. The five-year and final-year ratios of enforcement/inspections for the livestock industry were 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.  Also in the final year, the livestock industry was one of the two leaders among the 32 industries in terms of having the lowest  percentage of facilities with violations.<ref>US EPA. 2000. Profile of the agricultural livestock production industry. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Office of Compliance. EPA/310-R-00-002. 156 pp.</ref> In Canada, intensive livestock operations are subject to provincial regulation, with definitions of regulated entities varying among provinces. Examples include Intensive Livestock Operations (Saskatchewan), Confined Feeding Operations (Alberta), Feedlots (British Columbia), High-density Permanent Outdoor Confinement Areas (Ontario) and Feedlots or Parcs d'Engraissement (Manitoba). In Canada, intensive animal production, like other agricultural sectors, is also subject to various other federal and provincial requirements.

In the United States, farmed animals are excluded by half of all state [[animal cruelty]] laws including the federal [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]]. The 28-hour law, enacted in 1873 and amended in 1994 states that when animals are being transported for slaughter, the vehicle must stop every 28 hours and the animals must be let out for exercise, food, and water. The United States Department of Agriculture claims that the law does not apply to birds. The [[Humane Slaughter Act]] is similarly limited. Originally passed in 1958, the Act requires that livestock be stunned into unconsciousness prior to slaughter. This Act also excludes birds, who make up more than 90 percent of the animals slaughtered for food, as well as [[rabbit]]s and fish. Individual states all have their own animal cruelty statutes; however many states have a provision to exempt standard agricultural practices.<ref>[http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=1027] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928151011/http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=1027 |date=September 28, 2011 }} ALDF Farmed Animals and the Law</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusfd7usca1901.htm |title=US – Food Animal – Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter |publisher= Animal Legal & Historical Center |website=www.animallaw.info}}</ref>

In the United States there is an attempt to regulate farms in the most realistic way possible. The easiest way to effectively regulate the most animals with a limited number of resources and time is to regulate the large farms. In New York State many Animal Feeding Operations are not considered CAFOs since they either have less than 300 cows. These farms are not regulated to the level that CAFOs are. This can lead to pollution and nutrient leaching. The EPA website illustrates the scale of this problem by saying in New York State's Bay watershed there are 247 animal feeding operations and only 68<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/new_york_animal_agriculture_program_assessment_final_2.pdf|title=New York State Animal Agriculture Program Assessment|last=New York Animal Agriculture Program Assessment|date=December 3, 2019|website=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency}}</ref> of them are State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6054.html|title=State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) Permit Program|website=www.dec.ny.gov – NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> permitted CAFOs. This is the issue we need to deal with as the regulations on the non-CAFO farms are much less strict if there are any.

In Ohio animal welfare organizations reached a negotiated settlement with farm organizations while in California, [[California Proposition 2 (2008)|Proposition 2, Standards for Confining Farm Animals]], an initiated law was approved by voters in 2008.<ref>[http://www.smartvoter.org/2008/11/04/ca/state/prop/2/ Proposition 2, Standards for Confining Farm Animals].

An action plan was proposed by the USDA in February 2009, called the Utilization of Manure and Other Agricultural and Industrial Byproducts. This program's goal is to protect the environment and human and animal health by using manure in a safe and effective manner. In order for this to happen, several actions need to be taken and these four components include:<ref name="UMOAIIB 2009">{{cite web |title=Utilization of Manure and Other Agricultural and Industrial Byproducts |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Program/206/NP214ActionPlan25Feb2009.pdf. |publisher=USDA |accessdate=31 July 2020 |date=5 February 2009}}</ref>

In 2012 Australia's largest supermarket chain, Coles, announced that as of January 1, 2013, they will stop selling company branded pork and eggs from animals kept in factory farms. The nation's other dominant supermarket chain, Woolworths, has already begun phasing out factory farmed animal products. All of Woolworth's house brand eggs are now cage-free, and by mid-2013 all of their pork will come from farmers who operate stall-free farms.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ocean-robbins/animal-cruelty_b_2194615.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Ocean | last=Robbins | title=Is Animal Cruelty Doomed? | date=November 26, 2012}}</ref>

=== Animal welfare ===
In the UK, the [[Farm Animal Welfare Committee|Farm Animal Welfare Council]] was set up by the government to act as an independent advisor on [[animal welfare]] in 1979 and expresses its policy as five freedoms: from hunger & thirst; from discomfort; from pain, injury or disease; to express normal behavior; from fear and distress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fawc.org.uk/default.htm|title=Farm Animal Welfare Council|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103222718/http://www.fawc.org.uk/Default.htm|archive-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref>

There are differences around the world as to which practices are accepted and there continue to be changes in regulations with animal welfare being a strong driver for increased regulation. For example, the EU is bringing in further regulation to set maximum stocking densities for meat chickens by 2010, {{update inline|date=July 2015|reason=It is past 2010}} where the UK Animal Welfare Minister commented, "The welfare of meat chickens is a major concern to people throughout the European Union.

Factory farming is greatly debated throughout Australia, with many people disagreeing with the methods and ways in which the animals in factory farms are treated. Animals are often under stress from being kept in confined spaces and will attack each other. In an effort to prevent injury leading to infection, their beaks, tails and teeth are removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poultryhub.org/health/health-management/beak-trimming/ |title=Beak trimming|accessdate=August 5, 2012}}</ref> Many piglets will die of shock after having their teeth and tails removed, because painkilling medicines are not used in these operations. Factory farms are a popular way to gain space, with animals such as chickens being kept in spaces smaller than an A4 page.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Eating Animals |date=2010 |publisher=Hachette Book Group USA |others=Foer, Jonathan Safran |isbn=9780316127165 |pages=47|oclc=669754727}}</ref>

For example, in the UK, [[debeaking]] of chickens is [[deprecated]], but it is recognized that it is a method of last resort, seen as better than allowing vicious fighting and ultimately [[Cannibalism in poultry|cannibalism]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Between 60 and 70 percent<ref>Barnett JL, Hemsworth PH, Cronin GM, Jongman EC, and Hutson GD. 2001.

The CDC writes that chemical, bacterial, and viral compounds from animal waste may travel in the soil and water. Residents near such farms report problems such as unpleasant smell, flies and adverse health effects.<ref name="CAFOCDCP"/>

The CDC has identified a number of pollutants associated with the discharge of animal waste into rivers and lakes, and into the air. [[Antibiotic use in livestock]] may create antibiotic-resistant pathogens; parasites, bacteria, and viruses may be spread; [[ammonia]], [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]] can reduce oxygen in surface waters and contaminate drinking water; pesticides and hormones may cause hormone-related changes in fish; animal feed and feathers may stunt the growth of desirable plants in surface waters and provide nutrients to disease-causing micro-organisms; trace elements such as [[arsenic]] and [[copper]], which are harmful to human health, may contaminate surface waters.<ref name="CAFOCDCP"/>

Intensive farming may make the evolution and spread of harmful diseases easier.

In the United States, the use of antibiotics in livestock is still prevalent. The FDA reports that 80 percent of all antibiotics sold in 2009 were administered to livestock animals, and that many of these antibiotics are identical or closely related to drugs used for treating illnesses in humans. Consequently, many of these drugs are losing their effectiveness on humans, and the total healthcare costs associated with drug-resistant bacterial infections in the United States are between $16.6 billion and $26 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr965/text|title=H.R. 965: Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2011|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=August 5, 2012}}</ref>

A 2011 nationwide study reported nearly half of the meat and poultry sold in U.S. grocery stores – 47 percent – was contaminated with S. aureus, and more than half of those bacteria – 52 percent – were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgen.org/news/index.cfm?newsid=1948|title=Nationwide study finds U.S. meat and poultry is widely contaminated|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate=July 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523025801/http://www.tgen.org/news/index.cfm?newsid=1948|archive-date=May 23, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Although Staph should be killed with proper cooking, it may still pose a risk to consumers through improper food handling and cross-contamination in the kitchen. The senior author of the study said, "The fact that drug-resistant S. aureus was so prevalent, and likely came from the food animals themselves, is troubling, and demands attention to how antibiotics are used in food-animal production today."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110415083153.htm|title=US meat and poultry is widely contaminated with drug-resistant Staph bacteria, study finds<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref>

In April 2009, lawmakers in the Mexican state of Veracruz accused large-scale hog and poultry operations of being breeding grounds of a pandemic swine flu, although they did not present scientific evidence to support their claim. A swine flu which quickly killed more than 100 infected persons in that area, appears to have begun in the vicinity of a [[Smithfield Foods|Smithfield]] subsidiary pig [[CAFO]] (concentrated animal feeding operation).<ref>{{cite news | author = David Kirby | title = Mexican Lawmaker: Factory Farms Are "Breeding Grounds" of Swine Flu Pandemic | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/mexican-lawmaker-factory_b_191579.html | work = The Huffington Post | date = April 28, 2009 | accessdate = April 28, 2009}}</ref>

===Environmental impact===

This sometimes results in the [[pollution]] of water, soil and air by [[agrochemical]]s and manure waste, and use of limited resources such as water and energy at unsustainable rates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/549|title=Is Meat Sustainable?|website=Worldwatch Institute: Vision for a Sustainable World|publisher=World Watch Magazine}}</ref> [[Entomophagy]] is evaluated by many experts{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} as a sustainable solution to traditional [[livestock]], and, if intensively farmed on a large-scale, would cause a far-lesser amount of environmental damage.

Industrial production of pigs and poultry is an important source of [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions and is predicted to become more so. On intensive pig farms, the animals are generally kept on concrete with slats or grates for the manure to drain through. The manure is usually stored in slurry form (slurry is a liquid mixture of urine and feces). During storage on farm, slurry emits [[methane]] and when manure is spread on fields it emits [[nitrous oxide]] and causes [[nitrogen pollution]] of land and water. Poultry manure from factory farms emits high levels of nitrous oxide and ammonia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/factor/stark.asp |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831063238/http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/factor/stark.asp |archive-date=August 31, 2010 |title=America's Animal Factories: How States Fail to Prevent Pollution from Livestock Waste}}</ref>

===Labor===

Small farmers are often absorbed into factory farm operations, acting as contract growers for the industrial facilities. In the case of poultry contract growers, farmers are required to make costly investments in construction of sheds to house the birds, buy required feed and drugs – often settling for slim profit margins, or even losses.

Research has shown that many immigrant workers in concentrated animal farming operations (CAFOs) in the United States receive little to no job-specific training or safety and health information regarding the hazards associated with these jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ramos|first1=Athena K.|last2=Fuentes|first2=Axel|last3=Trinidad|first3=Natalia|date=November 9, 2016|title=Perception of Job-Related Risk, Training, and Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) among Latino Immigrant Hog CAFO Workers in Missouri: A Pilot Study|journal=Safety|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=25|doi=10.3390/safety2040025|pmid=29607309|pmc=5875190}}</ref> Workers with limited English proficiency are significantly less likely to receive any work-related training, since it is often only provided in English. As a result, many workers do not perceive their jobs as dangerous. This causes inconsistent personal protective equipment (PPE) use, and can lead to workplace accidents and injuries. Immigrant workers are also less likely to report any workplace hazards and injuries.

===Market concentration===

The major concentration of the industry occurs at the slaughter and meat processing phase, with only four companies slaughtering and processing 81 percent of cows, 73 percent of sheep, 57 percent of pigs and 50 percent of chickens.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}   This concentration at the slaughter phase may be in large part due to regulatory barriers that may make it financially difficult for small slaughter plants to be built, maintained or remain in business. Factory farming may be no more beneficial to livestock producers than traditional farming because it appears to contribute to [[overproduction]] that drives down prices. Through "forward contracts" and "marketing agreements", meatpackers are able to set the price of livestock long before they are ready for production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/this-cattlemans-got-a-beef/Content?oid=1121453|title=This Cattleman's Got a Beef|work=Colorado Springs Independent|date=November 20, 2003|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> These strategies often cause farmers to lose money, as half of all U.S. family farming operations did in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foodandwater.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/FactoryFarmNation-web.pdf|title=''Factory Farm Nation: How America Turned its Livestock Farms into Factories''|date=November 2010|accessdate=July 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522140235/http://foodandwater.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/FactoryFarmNation-web.pdf|archive-date=May 22, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Many of the nation's livestock producers would like to market livestock directly to consumers but with limited USDA inspected slaughter facilities, livestock grown locally can not typically be slaughtered and processed locally.<ref>Testimony by Leland Swenson, president of the U.S. National Farmers' Union, before the House Judiciary Committee, September 12, 2000.</ref>

===Demonstrations===
