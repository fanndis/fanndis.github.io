== History ==

In 1861, the ''[[Indian High Courts Act 1861]]'' was enacted to create high courts for various provinces and abolished supreme courts at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay and also the s''adar adalats'' in presidency towns in their respective regions. These new high courts had the distinction of being the highest courts for all cases till the creation of the [[Federal Court of India]] under the ''[[Government of India Act 1935]]''. The Federal Court had jurisdiction to solve disputes between provinces and federal states and hear appeals against judgement of the high courts. The first CJI of India was [[H. J. Kania]].<ref name="History PDF" />

The Supreme Court of India came into being on 28 January 1950.<ref name="history">History of the Supreme Court of India</ref> It replaced both the [[Federal Court of India]] and the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] which were then at the apex of the Indian court system. The first proceedings and inauguration, however, took place on 28 January 1950 at 9:45 am, when the judges took their seats. Which is thus regarded as the official date of establishment.<ref>[https://www.sci.gov.in/pdf/Museum/m2.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712132113/http://www.sci.gov.in/pdf/Museum/m2.pdf |date=12 July 2017 }}[https://www.indianage.com/indian_history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128191154/https://www.indianage.com/indian_history |date=28 January 2019 }}[http://delhibarcouncil.com/resources-for-lawyers/delhi-courts/supreme-court/ Evolution of Judiciary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128191100/http://delhibarcouncil.com/resources-for-lawyers/delhi-courts/supreme-court/ |date=28 January 2019 }}</ref>

The Supreme Court initially had its seat at the [[Chamber of Princes]] in the [[Parliament of India|parliament building]] where the previous Federal Court of India sat from 1937 to 1950. The first Chief Justice of India was H. J. Kania. In 1958, the Supreme Court moved to its present premises.<ref name="history" /> Originally, the Constitution of India envisaged a supreme court with a chief justice and seven judges; leaving it to the parliament to increase this number.<ref name=SCcosnti>{{cite web|title=Constitution of Supreme Court of India|publisher=Supreme Court of India}}</ref> In formative years, the Supreme Court met from 10 to 12 in the morning and then 2 to 4 in the afternoon for 28 days in a month.<ref>name="History PDF"</ref>

== Court building architecture ==
[[File:Supreme Court of India - Central Wing.jpg|thumbnail|Central Wing of the court where the chief justice's courtroom is located]]

The building is shaped to symbolize scales of justice with its centre-beam being the Central Wing of the building, consisting of the Chief Justice's court, the largest of the courtrooms, with two court halls on either side. The Right Wing of the structure has the Bar, consisting of rooms, the offices of the [[Attorney General of India]] and other law officers and the library of the court. The Left Wing has the offices of the court. In all, there are 15 courtrooms in the various wings of the building.<ref name="History PDF" /><ref name=history /><ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution |publisher=Supreme Court of India |date=28 January 1950 }}</ref>
[[File:Building of The Supreme Court of India.jpg|thumb|Left side of the supreme court building]]

The foundation stone of the supreme court's building was laid on 29 October 1954 by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India. The main block of the building has been built on a triangular plot of 17 acres and has been designed in an [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-British style]] by the chief architect [[Ganesh Bhikaji Deolalikar]], the first Indian to head the [[Central Public Works Department]]. It has a {{convert|27.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high dome and a spacious colonnaded verandah. The court moved into the building in 1958. In 1979, two new wings{{Snd}}the East Wing and the West Wing{{Snd}}were added to the complex. 1994 saw the last extension.<ref name="history" />

=== Mother and Child Sculpture ===
[[File:Inside the Supreme Court of India. 16.jpg|thumb|Mother and Child Sculpture]]
On 20 February 1980, a black bronze sculpture of {{convert|210|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} height was installed in the lawn of the supreme court. It portrays [[Bharat Mata|Mother India]] in the form of the figure of a lady, sheltering the young Republic of India represented by the symbol of a child, who is upholding the laws of land symbolically shown in the form of an open book. On the book, a balance beam is shown, which represents dispensation of equal justice to all. The sculpture was made by the renowned artist [[Chintamoni Kar]]. The sculpture is just behind the statue of Mahatma Gandhi.{{fact|date=July 2020}}

=== Seal ===
The design of the Court's seal is reproduced from the wheel that appears on the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka|Sarnath Lion capital of Ashoka]] with 24 spokes. The inscription in [[Sanskrit]], [[Yato Dharma Tato Jaya|यतो धर्मस्ततो जयः]] ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: {{IAST|Yato Dharmastato Jayaḥ}}, means "whence justice (dharma), thence victory". It is also referred as the wheel of righteousness, encompassing truth, goodness and [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]].<ref name="History PDF" />

== Composition ==

=== Size of the court ===
Initially, the Constitution of India provided for a supreme court with a chief justice and 7 judges. In the early years, a [[En banc|full bench]] of the Supreme Court sat together to hear the cases presented before them. As the work of the Court increased and cases began to accumulate, Parliament increased the number of judges (including the Chief Justice) from the original 8 in 1950 to 11 in 1956, 14 in 1960, 18 in 1978, 26 in 1986, 31 in 2009, to 34 in 2019. As the number of the judges has increased, they sit in smaller benches of two or three (referred to as a [[division bench]])<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Rishad Ahmed|title=Missing the Wood for the Trees: The Unseen Crisis in the Supreme Court|journal=NUJS Law Review |date=July–September 2012|volume=5|issue=3/4|page=358|url=http://nujslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/04_rishad_ahmed.pdf#page=8|access-date=3 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208081111/http://nujslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/04_rishad_ahmed.pdf#page=8|archive-date=8 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>—coming together in larger benches of five or more (referred to as a [[Constitution bench (India)|constitution bench]]) when required to settle fundamental questions of law.

The largest-ever bench at the Supreme Court of India has been constituted in 1973 in [[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala|'''Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala'''.]] A bench of 13 judges was set up to decide whether Parliament had the unfettered right to amend the Constitution or not that eventually gave rise to the Basic Structure doctrine.

That is why we have used the word 'strive'.

Per the constitution, as held by the court in the [[Three Judges Cases]] – (1982, 1993, 1998), a judge is appointed to the supreme court by the president on the recommendation of the ''collegium'' &nbsp;— a closed group of the Chief Justice of India, the four most senior judges of the court and the senior-most judge hailing from the high court of a prospective appointee.<ref name="Where Angles Fear to Tread">{{cite book|title=Supreme but not infallible: Essays in honour of the Supreme Court of India|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-567226-8|editor=Kirpal|editor-first=Bhupinder N.|edition=6th impr.|location=[[New Delhi]]|pages=97–106|oclc=882928525}}</ref> This has resulted in a Memorandum of Procedure being followed, for the appointments.

Judges used to be appointed by the president on the advice of the [[Union Council of Ministers|union cabinet]].

The collegium system has come under a fair amount of criticism.<ref name="SanjayHegde" /> In 2015, the parliament passed a law to replace the collegium with a [[National Judicial Appointments Commission]] (NJAC). This was struck down as unconstitutional by the supreme court, in the [[National Judicial Appointments Commission|Fourth Judges' Case]], as the new system would undermine the independence of the judiciary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/sc-exposes-tyranny-of-the-elected/295674|title=SC Exposes 'Tyranny Of The Elected'|last=Sengupta|first=Uttam|date=21 October 2015|website=Outlook|access-date=2016-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917213615/http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/sc-exposes-tyranny-of-the-elected/295674|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Putting the old system of the collegium back, the court invited suggestions, even from the general public, on how to improve the collegium system, broadly along the lines of{{Snd}}setting up an eligibility criteria for appointments, a permanent secretariat to help the collegium sift through material on potential candidates, infusing more transparency into the selection process, grievance redressal and any other suggestion not in these four categories, like transfer of judges.<ref>{{cite web|last1=WP(C) No. 13/2015|title=Report filed by Ms. Pinky Anand ASG and Arvind P.

Once, in 2009, the recommendation for the appointment of a judge of a high court made by the collegium of that court, had come to be challenged in the supreme court. The court held that who could become a judge was a matter of fact, and any person had a right to question it. But who should become a judge was a matter of opinion and could not be questioned. As long as an effective consultation took place within a collegium in arriving at that opinion, the content or material placed before it to form the opinion could not be called for scrutiny in court.<ref>{{cite journal|date=6 July 2009|title=Mahesh Chandra Gupta v.

=== Tenure ===
Supreme court judges retire at the age of 65. However, there have been suggestions from the judges of the Supreme Court of India to provide for a fixed term for the judges including the Chief Justice of India.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chhibber|first=Maneesh|title=CJIs must have fixed tenures: Sathasivam|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/cjis-must-have-fixed-tenures-sathasivam/|access-date=26 April 2014|newspaper=Indian Express|date=25 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426054956/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/cjis-must-have-fixed-tenures-sathasivam/|archive-date=26 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Salary ===
Article 125 of the Indian constitution leaves it to the Indian parliament to determine the salary, other allowances, leave of absence, pension, etc. of the supreme court judges.

===Oath or affirmation===
Per Article 124 and third Schedule of the constitution, the chief justice (or a judge) of the Supreme Court of India is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the president an oath or affirmation that he/she 
{{Quotation|  ''will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my ability, knowledge and judgement perform the duties of my office without fear or favour, affection or ill-will and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws.''}}

===Removal===
[[Wikisource: Constitution of India/Part V|Article 124(4)]] of the constitution, President can remove a judge on proved misbehaviour or incapacity when [[Parliament of India|parliament]] approves with a majority of the total membership of each house in favour of impeachment and not less than two thirds of the members of each house present. For initiating [[impeachment]] proceedings against a judge, at least 50 members of [[Rajya Sabha]] or 100 members of [[Lok Sabha]] shall issue the notice per ''Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenewsinformer.com/national-news/supreme-courtsc-stcentral-gormentsc-st-actcentral-government/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127000528/http://thenewsinformer.com/national-news/supreme-courtsc-stcentral-gormentsc-st-actcentral-government/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-01-27|title=THE SUPREME COURT REFUSES TO BAN CHANGE IN SC-ST ACT}}</ref> Then a judicial committee would be formed to frame charges against the judge, to conduct the fair trial and to submit its report to parliament.

=== Post-retirement ===
A Person who has retired as a judge of the supreme court is debarred from practicing in any court of law or before any other authority in India. However, Supreme Court and high court judges are appointed to various posts in tribunals and commissions, after their retirement. Lawyer Ashish Goel in a recent article criticized this stating that post-retirement benefits for judges hampers judicial independence.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/post-retirement-prospects-for-constitutional-court-judges-tear-the-fabric-of-judicial-independence-7281471.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905130533/https://www.firstpost.com/india/post-retirement-prospects-for-constitutional-court-judges-tear-the-fabric-of-judicial-independence-7281471.html |archive-date=5 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Former Law Minister and Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, Arun Jaitley, also criticized the appointment of judges in government posts after their retirement. Jaitley famously said:"There are two kinds of judges - those who know the law and those who know the Law Minister. We are the only country in the world where judges appoint judges. Even though there is a retirement age, judges are not willing to retire. Pre-retirement judgements are influenced by post-retirement jobs."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/judges-verdicts-are-influenced-by-post-retirement-jobs-arun-jaitley-500640 |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923051233/https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/judges-verdicts-are-influenced-by-post-retirement-jobs-arun-jaitley-500640 |archive-date=23 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Landmark judgments ==

=== Land reform ===
After some of the courts overturned state laws for redistributing land from ''[[zamindar]]'' (landlord) estates on the ground that the laws violated the zamindars' fundamental rights, the [[parliament of India|parliament]] passed the 1st amendment to the constitution in 1951, followed by the 4th amendment in 1955, to uphold its authority to redistribute land. The supreme court countered these amendments in 1967 when it ruled in ''[[Golaknath v. State of Punjab]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Golaknath vs. State of Punjab |url=http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgs1.aspx?filename=2449 |publisher=Official Supreme Court Judis site |access-date=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025085421/http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgs1.aspx?filename=2449 |archive-date=25 October 2014 }}</ref> that the parliament did not have the power to abrogate fundamental rights, including the provisions on private property. The 25th amendment to the constitution in 1971 curtailed the right of a citizen to property as a fundamental right and gave authority to the government to infringe private property, which led to a furor amongst the ''zamindars''.

In the case of Shiva Kant Shukla (''Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur v. Shiv Kant Shukla''), popularly known as the ''Habeas Corpus case'', a bench of five senior-most judges of the supreme court ruled in favour of the state's right to unrestricted powers of detention during the emergency. Justices [[A.N. Ray]], [[P. N. Bhagwati]], [[Y. V. Chandrachud]], and [[Mirza Hameedullah Beg|M.H. Beg]], stated in the majority decision:<ref name=pucl>{{cite news

:(under the declaration of emergency) no person has any locus to move any writ petition under Art. 226 before a High Court for [[habeas corpus]] or any other writ or order or direction to challenge the legality of an order of detention.
The only dissenting opinion was from Justice [[H. R. Khanna]], who stated:
:detention without trial is an anathema to all those who love personal liberty... A dissent is an appeal to the brooding spirit of the law, to the intelligence of a future day, when a later decision may possibly correct the error into which the dissenting judge believes the court to have been betrayed.<ref name=pucl />

 }}</ref> In January 1977, Justice Khanna was superseded despite being the most senior judge at the time and thereby the government broke the convention of appointing only the seniormost judge to the position of Chief Justice of India. Justice Khanna remains a legendary figure among the legal fraternity in India for this decision.

''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote of this opinion: "The submission of an independent judiciary to absolutist government is virtually the last step in the destruction of a democratic society; and the Indian supreme court's decision appears close to utter surrender."

During the emergency period, the government also passed the [[Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of India|39th amendment]], which sought to limit judicial review for the election of the prime minister; only a body constituted by parliament could review this election.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> Subsequently, Parliament, with most opposition members in jail during the emergency, passed the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|42nd Amendment]] which prevented any court from reviewing any amendment to the constitution with the exception of procedural issues concerning ratification. A few years after the emergency, however, the supreme court rejected the absoluteness of the 42nd amendment and reaffirmed its power of judicial review in ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]'' (1980).

=== Post-1980: an assertive court ===
{{See also|Judicial Activism In India}}
After Indira Gandhi lost elections in 1977, the new government of [[Morarji Desai]], and especially [[Minister of Law and Justice|law minister]] [[Shanti Bhushan]] (who had earlier argued for the detenues in the ''Habeas Corpus case''), introduced a number of amendments making it more difficult to declare and sustain an emergency, and reinstated much of the power to the supreme court. It is said that the [[basic structure doctrine]], created in ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala]]'', was strengthened in ''Indira Gandhi's'' case and set in stone in ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Personal-law-should-be-subject-to-fundamental-rights-Jaitley/articleshow/49965830.cms|title=Personal law should be subject to fundamental rights: Jaitley|access-date=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106074107/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Personal-law-should-be-subject-to-fundamental-rights-Jaitley/articleshow/49965830.cms|archive-date=6 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The supreme court's creative and expansive interpretations of Article 21 (Life and Personal Liberty), primarily after the Emergency period, have given rise to a new jurisprudence of [[public interest litigation]] that has vigorously promoted many important economic and social rights (constitutionally protected but not enforceable) including, but not restricted to, the rights to free education, livelihood, a clean environment,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shelton|first1=Dinah|last2=Kiss|first2=Alexandre|title=Judicial handbook on Environmental Law|date=2005|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|isbn=92-807-2555-6|page=8|url=http://www.unep.org/delc/Portals/119/publications/Judicial-Handbook-Environmenal-Law.pdf#page=32|access-date=1 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511022001/http://www.unep.org/delc/Portals/119/publications/Judicial-Handbook-Environmenal-Law.pdf#page=32|archive-date=11 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> food and many others. Civil and political rights (traditionally protected in the Fundamental Rights chapter of the Indian constitution) have also been expanded and more fiercely protected. These new interpretations have opened the avenue for litigation on a number of important issues.

=== Recent important cases ===
Among the important pronouncements of the supreme court post 2000 is the Coelho case I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (Judgment of 11 January 2007). A unanimous bench of 9 judges reaffirmed the ''basic structure'' doctrine. It held that a constitutional amendment which entails violation of any fundamental rights which the court regards as forming part of the ''basic structure'' of the constitution can be struck down depending upon its impact and consequences. The judgment clearly imposes further limitations on the constituent power of Parliament with respect to the principles underlying certain fundamental rights. The judgment in Coelho has in effect restored the decision in Golaknath case regarding non-amendability of the constitution on account of infraction of fundamental rights, contrary to the judgment in the [[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala|''Kesavananda Bharati'' case]].

Another important decision was of the five-judge bench in ''[[Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India]]''; where the constitutional validity of Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 was upheld, subject to the "creamy layer" criteria. Importantly, the court refused to follow the '[[strict scrutiny]]' standards of review followed by the United States supreme court. At the same time, the court has applied the strict scrutiny standards in Anuj Garg v. Hotel Association of India<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2008|title=2008 ALL SCR 412 - Supreme Court Landmark Judgment [ Constitution of India, Article 245, Article 13, Article 372 ]|url=https://nearlaw.com/PDF/SC/2008/2008_all_scr_412.html|journal=Indian Journal of Supreme Court Reports|volume=1|pages=412|via=RNI Approved Legal Reporter|access-date=15 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115195104/https://nearlaw.com/PDF/SC/2008/2008_all_scr_412.html|archive-date=15 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> (2007) ([https://ssrn.com/abstract=1246892])a

<blockquote>Seldom, our society realises or cares to realise the trauma, agony and pain which the members of Transgender community undergo, nor appreciates the innate feelings of the members of the Transgender community, especially of those whose mind and body disown their biological sex. Our society often ridicules and abuses the Transgender community and in public places like railway stations, bus stands, schools, workplaces, malls, theatres [and] hospitals; they are sidelined and treated as untouchables, forgetting the fact that the moral failure lies in the society's unwillingness to contain or embrace different gender identities and expressions, a mindset which we have to change.</blockquote>

Justice Radhakrishnan said that transgender people should be treated consistently with other minorities under the law, enabling them to access jobs, healthcare and education.<ref>{{cite news|title=India court recognises transgender people as third gender|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-27031180|access-date=15 April 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=15 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415130906/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-27031180|archive-date=15 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> He framed the issue as one of human rights, saying that, "These TGs, even though insignificant in numbers, are still human beings, and therefore, they have every right to enjoy their human rights," concluding by declaring that:<ref name="TGruling" />

(1) [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijras]], eunuchs, apart from binary gender, were to be treated as "third gender" for the purpose of safeguarding their rights under Part III of the Indian Constitution and the laws made by Parliament and the State Legislatures.

(2) Transgender persons' right to decide their self-identified gender was to be upheld and that the Union and State Governments were to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.

==== Relief to over 35,000 public servants ====
In B.Prabhakara Rao vs. State of A.P. involved sudden reduction in age of superannuation from 58 years to 55 years of over 35,000 public servants of State Government, public sector undertakings, statutory bodies, educational institutions and Tirupathi-Tirumalai Devasthanams (TTD). They lost first round of litigation in the supreme court. Realizing the mistake, fresh legislation was brought restoring the original age of superannuation of 58 years but providing that the benefit of new legislation would not extend to those whose reduction of age of superannuation had been upheld. In challenge to this law, Subodh Markandeya argued that all that was required was to strike down naughty "not" – which found favour with the supreme court bringing relief to over 35,000 public servants.

==== Decriminalisation of homosexuality ====

On 6 September 2018, a five-member constitutional bench decriminalised homosexuality by partially striking down [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] in the case [[Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India]]. The bench led by [[Dipak Misra]] unanimously declared that criminalisation of private consensual sex between adult persons of the same sex under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was clearly unconstitutional. The court, however, held that the section would apply to bestiality, sex with minors and non consensual sexual acts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-decriminalises-homosexuality/article24887363.ece|title=Supreme Court decriminalises homosexuality|date=7 September 2018|newspaper=The Hindu|access-date=2 June 2019|first=Krishnadas|last=Rajagopal}}</ref>

=== Rule of law ===
Supreme court has not taken up the trail of many pending cases, since April 2014 (more than three years), challenging the validity of the [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014]] which was enacted by the [[Parliament]] without following the [[Amendment of the Constitution of India|stipulated procedure in the Constitution]] and is claimed detrimental to the basic foundation of the constitution on which the [[Basic structure doctrine|basic structure of the constitution]] is resting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-admits-petition-against-formation-of-telangana/article5940913.ece|title=Supreme Court admits petition against formation Telangana|access-date=3 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703232407/https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-admits-petition-against-formation-of-telangana/article5940913.ece|archive-date=3 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The basic foundation of the constitution is the dignity and the freedom of its citizens which is of supreme importance and can not be destroyed by any legislation of the parliament. Whereas the fair trial to examine the validity of the ninety-ninth constitutional amendment dated 31 December 2014, to form [[National Judicial Appointments Commission]] for the purpose of appointing the judges of the supreme court and high courts, was conducted on utmost priority and supreme court delivered its judgement on 16 October 2015 (within a year) quashing the constitutional amendment as unconstitutional and [[ultra vires]] stating the said amendment is interfering with the independence of the [[judiciary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-verdict-on-njac-and-collegium-system/article7769266.ece?homepage=true     |title=SC declares NJAC unconstitutional, upholds Collegium|publisher=[[The Hindu|THE HINDU]]| date=16 October 2015}}</ref> Disposal of the various petitions filed against [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014]] is also equally important as it has alienated the basic rights of a vast section of Indian citizens and also against federal character of the constitution which is part of the basic structure of the constitution.

===Holidays and working hours===
The Supreme court works from 10 am to 4:30 pm, but is closed during winter and summer for 2 weeks each. Some critics feel that this delays pending cases. However, in an interview in June 2018 with [[NDTV]], Justice Chelameswar revealed that most Supreme court judges including him work around 14 hours per day, and continue to work for an average of 7 hours per day even during vacations. He further reminded that the Supreme Court of United States delivers judgement on just 120 cases in a year, while every judge in the Supreme court of India delivers judgements on 1000-1500 cases.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dont regret going to public, that is why: Interview with Justice Chelameswar |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/on-his-last-day-at-supreme-court-justice-jasti-chelameswar-speaks-to-ndtv-full-transcript-1871856 |access-date=8 November 2018 |publisher=NDTV |date=23 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108184414/https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/on-his-last-day-at-supreme-court-justice-jasti-chelameswar-speaks-to-ndtv-full-transcript-1871856 |archive-date=8 November 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Appointment ===
It has been pointed out that consensus within the Collegium is occasionally resolved through trade-offs, resulting in unreliable appointments with consequences for litigants There has also been growing sycophancy and "lobbying" within the system. Justice Chelameswar gave evidence from existing records to argue this point. In one case, "a judge was blocked from elevation to the Madras High Court in 2009, in what ''appeared to have been a joint venture in the subversion of the law'' governing the collegium system ''by both the executive and the judiciary.''"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/law/what-judiciary-done-itself|title=What the Indian judiciary has done to itself|last=Dev|first=Atul|website=The Caravan|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716201734/https://caravanmagazine.in/law/what-judiciary-done-itself|archive-date=16 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 18 April 2019 an unnamed married woman employee of the [[Supreme court]] filed an affidavit stating that the Chief Justice [[Ranjan Gogoi]] had sexually harassed her on 10–11 October 2018 by pressing his body against hers against her will. An in-house committee of the Court quickly cleared Gogoi of the sexual harassment charges, although the report of the committee was not provided to the complainant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48177737|title=Indian Chief Justice Cleared of Sexual Harassment|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820162954/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48177737|archive-date=20 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> However, there were widespread protests against the manner in which the woman's complaint was dealt with by Supreme Court.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/women-lawyers-activists-protest-against-clean-chit-to-cji-ranjan-gogoi/videoshow/69214922.cms|title= Lawyers, Activists Protest against Clean Chit to CJI Ranjan Gogoi|website=Economic Times|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> A petition was filed before [[National Human Rights Commission]] to obtain the report of the in-house committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/complaint-in-nhrc-seeks-sexual-harassment-report-which-gave-clean-chit-to-cji-ranjan-gogoi-1536015-2019-05-27|title=Complaint in NHRC Seeking Sexual Harassment Report on CJI Ranjan Gogoi|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530101346/https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/complaint-in-nhrc-seeks-sexual-harassment-report-which-gave-clean-chit-to-cji-ranjan-gogoi-1536015-2019-05-27|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[National Law University]] topper Survi Karwa skipped her convocation to avoid receiving her degree from [[Ranjan Gogoi]] in protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/nlu-topper-skips-convocation-to-avoid-receiving-award-from-cji-ranjan-gogoi-over-sexual-harassment-claims-4349651.html|title=NLU Topper Skips Convocation in Protest against Ranjan Gogoi|website=Money Control|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820161454/https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/nlu-topper-skips-convocation-to-avoid-receiving-award-from-cji-ranjan-gogoi-over-sexual-harassment-claims-4349651.html|archive-date=20 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The in house committee which cleared Gogoi of sexual harassment was chaired by Justice S A Bobde, who himself succeeded Gogoi as chief justice.

In the sensational [[Unnao rape case]], although the rape victim had written letters to the Chief Justice apprehending death threats, the letter was allegedly not placed before the Court. A few days later the victim's family was wiped out in a road accident reportedly staged by the now convicted rapist and former [[BJP]] member [[Kuldeep Sengar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-explain-why-unnao-rape-victim-s-letter-to-cji-not-placed-before-court-sc-to-secretary-general-to-hear-matter-tomorrow-2777599|title=Rape Victim's Letter Was Not Placed Before Supreme Court|website=DNA India|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801142049/https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-explain-why-unnao-rape-victim-s-letter-to-cji-not-placed-before-court-sc-to-secretary-general-to-hear-matter-tomorrow-2777599|archive-date=1 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
