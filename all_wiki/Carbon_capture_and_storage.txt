Capturing {{co2}} is most effective at point sources, such as large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities, natural gas electric power generation plants, industries with major {{co2}} emissions, [[natural gas processing]], synthetic fuel plants and fossil fuel-based [[hydrogen production]] plants. Extracting {{co2}} from air is also possible,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/01/carbon_seq/7b1.pdf |title=Capturing Carbon Dioxide From Air |accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref> although the far lower concentration of {{co2}} in air compared to combustion sources presents significant engineering challenges.<ref>{{cite web |date= May 2018 |url= http://www.geoengineeringmonitor.org/2018/05/direct-air-capture/ |title= Direct Air Capture Technology (Technology Fact Sheet), Geoengineering Monitor |accessdate= 2018-07-01}}</ref>

Organisms that produce [[ethanol]] by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] generate cool, essentially pure {{co2}} that can be pumped underground.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.energycurrent.com/index.php?id=2&storyid=7910 |title= News for the Business of Energy |publisher= Energy Current |accessdate= 2010-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208031230/http://www.energycurrent.com/index.php?id=2&storyid=7910 |archivedate= 2008-12-08}}</ref> Fermentation produces slightly less {{co2}} than ethanol by weight.

Impurities in {{co2}} streams, like sulfurs and water, could have a significant effect on their phase behavior and could pose a significant threat of increased corrosion of pipeline and well materials. In instances where {{co2}} impurities exist, especially with air capture, a scrubbing separation process would be needed to initially clean the flue gas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pip-24#carbon-dioxide-purification|title=Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines - 5 Carbon dioxide plant design|publisher=Energy Institute|accessdate=2012-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015221653/http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pip-24#carbon-dioxide-purification|archive-date=2013-10-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the Wallula Energy Resource Center in Washington state, by gasifying coal, it is possible to capture approximately 65% of carbon dioxide embedded in it and sequester it in a solid form.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wallulaenergy.com/index.tpl?dsp=what |title=Wallula Energy Resource Center |publisher=Wallulaenergy.com |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2010-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715164250/http://www.wallulaenergy.com/index.tpl?dsp=what |archivedate=2010-07-15}}</ref>

Broadly, three different configurations of technologies for capture exist: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxyfuel combustion:

*In ''[[post combustion capture]]'', the {{co2}} is removed after combustion of the fossil fuel—this is the scheme that would be applied to fossil-fuel burning power plants. Here, carbon dioxide is captured from [[flue gas]]es at [[Fossil fuel power plant|power station]]s or other large point sources. The technology is well understood and is currently used in other industrial applications, although not at the same scale as might be required in a commercial scale power station. Post combustion capture is most popular in research because existing fossil fuel power plants can be retrofitted to include CCS technology in this configuration.<ref name="Carbon Dioxide Capture in Metal–Org">{{cite journal |last1=Sumida |first1=Kenji |last2=Rogow |first2=David L. |last3=Mason |first3=Jarad A. |last4=McDonald |first4=Thomas M. |last5=Bloch |first5=Eric D. |last6=Herm |first6=Zoey R. |last7=Bae |first7=Tae-Hyun |last8=Long |first8=Jeffrey R. |title=Carbon Dioxide Capture in Metal–Organic Frameworks |journal=Chemical Reviews |date=28 December 2011 |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=724–781 |doi=10.1021/cr2003272 |pmid=22204561 }}</ref>
*The technology for ''pre-combustion'' is widely applied in fertilizer, chemical, gaseous fuel (H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>), and power production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/brochures/pdfs/Gasification_Brochure.pdf |title=Gasification Body |accessdate=2010-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527234540/http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/brochures/pdfs/Gasification_Brochure.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-27 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In these cases, the fossil fuel is partially oxidized, for instance in a [[gasification|gasifier]]. The CO from the resulting [[syngas]] (CO and H<sub>2</sub>) reacts with added steam (H<sub>2</sub>O) and is [[Water gas shift reaction|shifted]] into {{co2}} and H<sub>2</sub>. The resulting {{co2}} can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream. The H<sub>2</sub> can now be used as fuel; the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place. There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon dioxide capture.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/integrated-gasification-combined-cycle-for-carbon-capture-storage.html  | title=(IGCC) Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle for Carbon Capture & Storage | publisher=Claverton Energy Group}} (conference, 24 October, Bath)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/carboncaptureandstorage|title=Carbon Capture and Storage at Imperial College London|website=Imperial College London}}</ref> The {{co2}} is removed after combustion of fossil fuels, but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure. This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants, or to existing plants where re-powering is an option.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The capture before expansion, i.e. from pressurized gas, is standard in almost all industrial {{co2}} capture processes, at the same scale as required for power plants.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Bryngelsson |first1=Mårten |last2=Westermark |first2=Mats |title=Feasibility study of {{CO2}} removal from pressurized flue gas in a fully fired combined cycle: the Sargas project |conference=Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems |pages=703–10 |year=2005 |url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-10976}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2009.01.184 |title={{CO2}} capture pilot test at a pressurized coal fired CHP plant |year=2009 |last1=Bryngelsson |first1=Mårten |last2=Westermark |first2=Mats |journal=Energy Procedia |volume=1 |pages=1403–10|doi-access=free }}</ref>

To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and injected into the combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored. Power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are sometimes referred to as "zero emission" cycles, because the {{co2}} stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream (as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A certain fraction of the {{co2}} generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water. To warrant the label "zero emission" the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately.

Absorption, or [[carbon dioxide scrubber|carbon scrubbing]], with [[amines]] is the dominant capture technology. It is the only carbon capture technology so far that has been used industrially.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Facility Data - Global CCS Institute|url=https://co2re.co/FacilityData|access-date=2020-11-17|website=co2re.co}}</ref>

Carbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF ([[Metal–organic framework]]) through [[physisorption]] or [[chemisorption]] based on the porosity and [[Sensitivity and specificity|selectivity]] of the MOF leaving behind a [[Greenhouse gas]] poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly. The carbon dioxide is then stripped off the MOF using temperature swing adsorption (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) so the MOF can be reused. Adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the {{co2}} is removed from the sorbent or solution that collected it from the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused. Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading amine for capturing {{co2}}, have a heat capacity between 3–4 J/g K since they are mostly water.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herm |first1=Zoey R. |last2=Swisher |first2=Joseph A. |last3=Smit |first3=Berend |last4=Krishna |first4=Rajamani |last5=Long |first5=Jeffrey R. |title=Metal−Organic Frameworks as Adsorbents for Hydrogen Purification and Precombustion Carbon Dioxide Capture |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=20 April 2011 |volume=133 |issue=15 |pages=5664–5667 |doi=10.1021/ja111411q |pmid=21438585 |url=https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/200724/files/Herm-2011-Metal-Organic%20Framew.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kulkarni |first1=Ambarish R. |last2=Sholl |first2=David S. |title=Analysis of Equilibrium-Based TSA Processes for Direct Capture of CO2 from Air |journal=Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research |date=18 June 2012 |volume=51 |issue=25 |pages=8631–8645 |doi=10.1021/ie300691c }}</ref> Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step.

About two thirds of the total cost of CCS is attributed to capture, making it limit the wide-scale deployment of CCS technologies. To optimize a {{co2}} capture process would significantly increase the feasibility of CCS since the transport and storage steps of CCS are rather mature technologies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McDonald |first1=Thomas M. |last2=Mason |first2=Jarad A. |last3=Kong |first3=Xueqian |last4=Bloch |first4=Eric D. |last5=Gygi |first5=David |last6=Dani |first6=Alessandro |last7=Crocellà |first7=Valentina |last8=Giordanino |first8=Filippo |last9=Odoh |first9=Samuel O. |last10=Drisdell |first10=Walter S. |last11=Vlaisavljevich |first11=Bess |last12=Dzubak |first12=Allison L. |last13=Poloni |first13=Roberta |last14=Schnell |first14=Sondre K. |last15=Planas |first15=Nora |last16=Lee |first16=Kyuho |last17=Pascal |first17=Tod |last18=Wan |first18=Liwen F. |last19=Prendergast |first19=David |last20=Neaton |first20=Jeffrey B. |last21=Smit |first21=Berend |last22=Kortright |first22=Jeffrey B. |last23=Gagliardi |first23=Laura |last24=Bordiga |first24=Silvia |last25=Reimer |first25=Jeffrey A. |last26=Long |first26=Jeffrey R. |title=Cooperative insertion of CO2 in diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks |journal=Nature |date=11 March 2015 |volume=519 |issue=7543 |pages=303–308 |doi=10.1038/nature14327 |pmid=25762144 |bibcode=2015Natur.519..303M |hdl=11250/2458220 |s2cid=4447122 |url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt2vs0h0wg/qt2vs0h0wg.pdf?t=pc0dah }}</ref>

An alternate method under development is [[chemical looping combustion]] (CLC). Chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen carrier. Metal oxide particles react with a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel in a [[fluidization|fluidized bed]] combustor, producing solid metal particles and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor.  The water vapor is condensed, leaving pure carbon dioxide, which can then be sequestered.  The solid metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air, producing heat and regenerating metal oxide particles that are recirculated to the fluidized bed combustor. A variant of chemical looping is [[calcium looping]], which uses the alternating carbonation and then calcination of a [[calcium oxide]] based carrier as a means of capturing {{co2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-ccs-2011/online/26886#non-power-pcc-applications|title=The Global Status of CCS: 2011 - Capture|publisher=The Global CCS Institute|accessdate=2012-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206033937/http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-ccs-2011/online/26886#non-power-pcc-applications|archive-date=2013-02-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== CO<sub>2</sub> transportation ==

After capture, the {{co2}} would have to be transported to suitable storage sites. This would most likely be done by pipeline, which is generally the cheapest form of transport for large volumes of {{co2}}.

Ships can also be utilized for transport where pipelines are not feasible, methods which are currently used for transporting {{co2}} for other applications.

For example, there were approximately 5,800&nbsp;km of {{co2}} pipelines in the United States in 2008, and a 160&nbsp;km pipeline in Norway,<ref name="POST1">{{cite journal |title=CO2 Capture, transport and storage |journal=Postnote |date=June 2009 |volume=335 |url=https://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn335.pdf |accessdate=10 August 2019 |publisher=Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology |quote=Since 2008 Norway’s Statoil has been transporting CO2(obtained from natural gas extraction) through a 160 km seabed pipeline}}</ref> used to transport {{co2}} to oil production sites where it is then injected into older fields to extract oil. This injection of {{co2}} to produce oil is called ''[[enhanced oil recovery]]''. There are also several pilot programs in various stages of development to test the long-term storage of {{co2}} in non-oil producing geologic formations.
As the technology develops, costs, benefits and detractions are changing. According to the United States [[Congressional Research Service]], "There are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements, economic regulation, utility cost recovery, regulatory classification of {{co2}} itself, and pipeline safety. Furthermore, because {{co2}} pipelines for enhanced oil recovery are already in use today, policy decisions affecting {{co2}} pipelines take on an urgency that is unrecognized by many. Federal classification of {{co2}} as both a commodity (by the [[Bureau of Land Management]]) and as a pollutant (by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]) could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future CCS implementation, but also to ensure consistency of future CCS with {{co2}} pipeline operations today."<ref>{{cite web |first1=Paul W. |last1=Parfomak |first2=Peter |last2=Folger |title=CRS Report for Congress: Carbon Dioxide ({{co2}}) Pipelines for Carbon Sequestration: Emerging Policy Issues", Updated January 17, 2008 (Order Code RL33971) |url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33971_20080117.pdf |publisher=Assets.opencrs.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911225918/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33971_20080117.pdf |archivedate=11 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1=Adam |last1=Vann |first2=Paul W. |last2=Parfomak |title=CRS Report for Congress: Regulation of Carbon Dioxide ({{co2}}) Sequestration Pipelines: Jurisdictional Issues", Updated April 15, 2008 (Order Code RL34307) |format=PDF |url=http://ncseonline.org/nle/crs/abstract.cfm?NLEid=2051 |publisher=Ncseonline.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208194215/http://ncseonline.org/NLE/CRs/abstract.cfm?NLEid=2051 |archivedate=8 February 2010}} (reviewing federal jurisdictional issues related to {{co2}} pipelines and reviewing agency jurisdictional determinations under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Natural Gas Act)</ref> In the United Kingdom, the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology revealed that they would also envisage pipelines as the main transport throughout the UK.<ref name=POST1 />

== Sequestration ==
{{Main|Carbon sequestration}}

Various forms have been conceived for permanent storage of {{co2}}. These forms include gaseous storage in various deep geological formations (including saline formations and exhausted gas fields), and solid storage by reaction of {{co2}} with metal [[oxide]]s to produce stable [[carbonate]]s. In the past it was suggested that {{co2}} could be stored in the oceans, but this would exacerbate [[ocean acidification]] and has been made illegal under the London and OSPAR conventions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=Tim |last2=Greaves |first2=Andy |last3=Christophersen |first3=Oyvind |last4=Vivian |first4=Chris |last5=Thomson |first5=Jolyon |title=International marine regulation of CO2 geological storage.

=== Geological storage ===

Also known as ''geo-sequestration'', this method involves injecting carbon dioxide, generally in [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] form, directly into underground geological formations. [[Oil field]]s, [[gas field]]s, saline formations, unmineable [[coal seam]]s, and saline-filled basalt formations have been suggested as storage sites. Various physical (e.g., highly impermeable [[caprock]]) and geochemical trapping mechanisms would prevent the {{co2}} from escaping to the surface.<ref name="Energy Institute">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pip-13|title=Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines - Storage|publisher=Energy Institute|accessdate=2012-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918003620/http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pip-13|archive-date=2012-09-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Unmineable coal seams can be used to store {{co2}} because the {{co2}} molecules attach to the surface of coal. The technical feasibility, however, depends on the permeability of the coal bed. In the process of absorption the coal releases previously absorbed [[methane]], and the methane can be recovered ([[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]]). The sale of the methane can be used to offset a portion of the cost of the {{co2}} storage. Burning the resultant methane, however, would negate some of the benefit of sequestering the original {{co2}}.

Saline formations contain highly mineralized brines, and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans. Saline aquifers have been used for storage of chemical waste in a few cases. The main advantage of saline aquifers is their large potential storage volume and their common occurrence. The major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them, especially compared to oil fields. To keep the cost of storage acceptable, the geophysical exploration may be limited, resulting in larger uncertainty about the aquifer structure. Unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds, no side product will offset the storage cost. ''Trapping mechanisms'' such as structural trapping, residual trapping, solubility trapping and mineral trapping may immobilize the {{co2}} underground and reduce the risk of leakage.<ref name="Energy Institute"/>

==== Enhanced oil recovery ====
Carbon dioxide is often injected into an [[oil field]] as an [[enhanced oil recovery]] technique,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2018/november/whatever-happened-to-enhanced-oil-recovery.html|title=November: Whatever happened to enhanced oil recovery?|website=www.iea.org|access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref> but because carbon dioxide is released when the oil is burned,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://watt-logic.com/2018/07/21/ccs/|title=Smoke & mirrors: a new report into the viability of CCS|last=Porter|first=Kathryn|date=2018-07-20|website=Watt-Logic|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref> it is not a carbon neutral process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Occidental-To-Remove-CO2-From-Air-Use-It-To-Boost-Oil-Recovery-In-The-Permian.html|title=Occidental To Remove CO2 From Air, Use It To Boost Oil Recovery In The Permian|website=OilPrice.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref>

=== Carbon dioxide degrading algae or bacteria ===
An alternative to geochemical injection would instead be to physically store carbon dioxide in containers with algae or bacteria that could degrade the carbon dioxide. It would ultimately be ideal to exploit the carbon dioxide metabolizing bacterium ''Clostridium thermocellum'' in such theoretical {{co2}} storage containers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Xiong |first1=Wei |last2=Lin |first2=Paul P. |last3=Magnusson |first3=Lauren |last4=Warner |first4=Lisa |last5=Liao |first5=James C. |last6=Maness |first6=Pin-Ching |last7=Chou |first7=Katherine J. |title=CO2-fixing one-carbon metabolism in a cellulose-degrading bacterium Clostridium thermocellum |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=28 October 2016 |volume=113 |issue=46 |pages=13180–13185 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1605482113 |pmid=27794122 |pmc=5135332 }}</ref> Using this bacteria would prevent overpressurization of such theoretical carbon dioxide storage containers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chemengonline.com/mechanical-co2-sequestration-improves-algae-production/?printmode=1|title=Mechanical CO2 sequestration improves algae production – Chemical Engineering – Page 1|accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>

=== Mineral storage ===
{{update section|date=June 2019}}
In this process, {{co2}} [[exothermic]]ally reacts with available metal oxides, which in turn produces stable carbonates (e.g. [[calcite]], [[magnesite]]). This process occurs naturally over many years and is responsible for a great amount of surface [[limestone]].  The idea of using [[olivine]] has been promoted by the geochemist Olaf Schuiling.<ref name="Olivine weathering">{{cite web|last=Schuiling|first=Olaf|title=Olaf Schuiling proposes olivine rock grinding|url=http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474979949059|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130411003510/http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474979949059|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-04-11|accessdate=2011-12-23}}{{self-published inline|date=March 2013}}</ref> The reaction rate can be made faster, for example, with a [[catalyst]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bhaduri |first1=Gaurav A. |last2=Šiller |first2=Lidija |title=Nickel nanoparticles catalyse reversible hydration of carbon dioxide for mineralization carbon capture and storage |journal=Catalysis Science & Technology |date=2013 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1234 |doi=10.1039/C3CY20791A }}</ref> or by reacting at higher temperatures and/or pressures, or by pre-treatment of the minerals, although this method can require additional energy. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] estimates that a power plant equipped with CCS using mineral storage will need 60–180% more energy than a power plant without CCS.<ref name='IPCC_CC'/>

The economics of mineral carbonation at scale are now being tested in a world-first pilot plant project based in Newcastle, Australia. New techniques for mineral activation and reaction have been developed the GreenMag Group and the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] and funded by the [[New South Wales]] and Australian Governments to be operational by 2013.<ref name="www.dpi.nsw.gov.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/minerals/resources/low-emissions-coal/nsw-clean-coal-fund-research-projects#Storage-of-Captured-Carbon-Dioxide-(CO-sub-2--sub-) |title=GreenMag-Newcastle Mineral Carbonation Pilot Plant|publisher=www.dpi.nsw.gov.au |date=2010-06-06 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>

In 2009 it was reported that scientists had mapped {{convert|6000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of rock formations in the United States that could be used to store 500 years' worth of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.<ref>[http://www.livescience.com/environment/090309-co2-rock-map.html Rocks Found That Could Store Greenhouse Gas], Live Science, 9 March 2009</ref> A study on mineral sequestration in the US states:
<blockquote>Carbon sequestration by reacting naturally occurring Mg and Ca containing minerals with {{co2}} to form carbonates has many unique advantages. Most notabl[e] is the fact that carbonates have a lower energy state than {{co2}}, which is why mineral carbonation is thermodynamically favorable and occurs naturally (e.g., the weathering of rock over geologic time periods). Secondly, the raw materials such as magnesium based minerals are abundant. Finally, the produced carbonates are unarguably stable and thus re-release of {{co2}} into the atmosphere is not an issue. However, conventional carbonation pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures. The significant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and environmentally viable carbonation route that will allow mineral sequestration to be implemented with acceptable economics.<ref>

===== Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project =====
The [[Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project]] is part of the Gorgon Project, the world's largest natural gas project. The Gorgon Project, located on Barrow Island in Western Australia, includes a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, a domestic gas plant, and a Carbon Dioxide Injection Project.

The initial carbon dioxide injections were planned to take place by the end of 2017. Once launched, the Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project will be the world's largest {{CO2}} injection plant, with an ability to store up to 4 million tons of {{CO2}} per year – approximately 120 million tons over the project's lifetime, and 40 percent of total Gorgon Project emissions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The project started extracting gas in February 2017, but carbon capture and storage is now not expected to begin until the first half of 2019 (still not independently verified as of September 2020) , requiring a further five million tonnes of {{CO2}} to be released, because:

Alberta has committed $170 million in 2013/2014 – and a total of $1.3 billion over 15 years – to fund two large-scale CCS projects that will help reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from oil sands refining.

The [[Alberta Carbon Trunk Line System|Alberta Carbon Trunk Line]] Project (ACTL), pioneered by Enhance Energy, consists of a 240&nbsp;km pipeline that collects carbon dioxide from various sources in Alberta and transport it to Clive oil fields for use in [[Enhanced oil recovery|EOR]] (enhanced oil recovery) and permanent storage. This CAN$1.2 billion project collects carbon dioxide initially from the Redwater Fertilizer Facility and the [[Sturgeon Refinery]]. The projections for ACTL make it the largest carbon capture and sequestration project in the world, with an estimated full capture capacity of 14.6 Mtpa. Construction plans for the ACTL are in their final stages and capture and storage is expected to start sometime in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enhanceenergy.com/pdf/News/releases/Information_Brochure_v18.pdf|title=Information Brochure, Proposed EOR Development Project|website=www.enhanceenergy.com|access-date=2018-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827062028/http://enhanceenergy.com/pdf/News/releases/Information_Brochure_v18.pdf|archive-date=2018-08-27|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jwnenergy.com/article/2018/8/construction-commence-alberta-carbon-trunk-line-wolf-gets-deal/|title=Construction to commence on Alberta Carbon Trunk Line as Wolf gets in on the deal {{!}} Pipelines & Transportation|last=Jaremko|first=Deborah|date=2018-08-03|website=JWN Energy|language=en|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/alberta-carbon-trunk-line-alberta/|title=Alberta Carbon Trunk Line, Alberta|website=Hydrocarbons Technology|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>

===== British Columbia =====
British Columbia has been making strides with regards to reducing their carbon emissions. The province implemented North America's first large-scale [[carbon tax]] in 2008. An updated carbon tax in 2018 set the price at $35 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. This tax will increase by $5 every year until it reaches $50 in 2021. Carbon taxes will make carbon capture and sequestration projects more financially feasible for the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/climate-change/planning-and-action/carbon-tax|title=British Columbia's Carbon Tax - Province of British Columbia|last=Environment|first=Ministry of|website=www2.gov.bc.ca|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>

===== Boundary Dam Power Station Unit 3 Project =====
[[Boundary Dam Power Station]], owned by SaskPower, is a coal fired station that was originally commissioned back in 1959. In 2010, SaskPower committed to retrofitting the [[lignite]]-powered Unit 3 with a carbon capture unit in order to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The project was completed in 2014. The retrofit utilized a post-combustion amine absorption technology in order to capture the CO<sub>2</sub>. The captured CO<sub>2</sub> was planned to be sold to Cenovus to be used for EOR in Weyburn field. Any CO<sub>2</sub> not used for EOR was planned to be used by the Aquistore project and stored in deep saline aquifers. Many complications has kept Unit 3 and this project from being online as much as expected, but between August 2017 – August 2018, Unit 3 was online for 65% of every day on average. Since the start of operation, the Boundary Dam project has captured over 1 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> and has a nameplate capacity of capture of 1 Mtpa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saskpower.com/about-us/our-company/blog/bd3-status-update-august-2018|title=BD3 Status Update: August 2018|website=www.saskpower.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/boundary_dam.html|title=Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies @ MIT|website=sequestration.mit.edu|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> SaskPower does not intend to retrofit the rest of its units as they are mandated to be phased out by the government by 2024.

====== Great Plains Synfuel Plant and Weyburn-Midale Project ======
The Great Plains Synfuel Plant, owned by [[Dakota Gasification Company|Dakota Gas]], is a [[coal gasification]] operation that produces synthetic natural gas and various petrochemicals from coal. The plant has been in operation since 1984, but carbon capture and storage did not start until 2000. In 2000, Dakota Gas retrofitted the plant with a carbon capture unit in order to sell the CO<sub>2</sub> to Cenovus and Apache Energy, who intended to use the CO<sub>2</sub> for [[enhanced oil recovery]] (EOR) in the Weyburn and Midale fields in Canada. The Midale fields are injected with 0.4 Mtpa and the Weyburn fields are injected with 2.4 Mtpa for a total injection capacity of 2.8 Mtpa. The [[Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project]] (or IEA GHG Weyburn-Midale CO<sub>2</sub> Monitoring and Storage Project), an international collaborative scientific study conducted between 2000–2011 also took place here, but injection has continued even after the study has concluded. Since 2000, over 30 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> has been injected and both the plant and EOR projects are still operational.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zeroco2.no/projects/the-great-plains-synfuels-plant|title=Great Plains Synfuels Plant — zeroco2|website=www.zeroco2.no|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/what-happens-when-co2-stored-underground-qa-ieaghg-weyburn-midale-co2-monitoring-and-storage-project/what-weyburn-midale-project-wmp|title=What is the Weyburn-Midale Project (WMP)? {{!}} Global CCS Institute|website=hub.globalccsinstitute.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181207145555/https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/what-happens-when-co2-stored-underground-qa-ieaghg-weyburn-midale-co2-monitoring-and-storage-project/what-weyburn-midale-project-wmp|archive-date=7 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/weyburn.html|title=Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies @ MIT|website=sequestration.mit.edu|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref>

Three such facilities are already operational or in late stages of construction, but these projects draw CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas processing or petrochemical production. At least eight more facilities are in early planning and development, most of which will capture emissions from power plants. Almost all of these CCS projects, regardless of CO<sub>2</sub> source, inject carbon dioxide for the purpose of EOR.<ref name=":02"/>

=====CNPC Jilin Oil Field=====
China's very first carbon capture project is the [[Jilin oil field]] in [[Songyuan]], [[Jilin province|Jilin Province]]. It started as a pilot EOR project in 2009,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/jilin.html|title=Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies @ MIT|website=sequestration.mit.edu|access-date=2018-11-24}}</ref> but has since developed into a commercial operation for the [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] (CNPC), with the final phase of development completed in 2018.<ref name=":02" /> The source of carbon dioxide is the nearby Changling gas field, from which natural gas with about 22.5% CO<sub>2</sub> is extracted. After separation at the natural gas processing plant, the carbon dioxide is transported to Jilin via pipeline and injected for a 37% enhancement in oil recovery at the low-permeability oil field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/xhtml/pdf/15-CCUS-EOR%20Practice%20in%20Jilin%20Oilfield.pdf|title=CCUS-EOR Practice in Jilin Oilfield|website=China National Petroleum Corporation|access-date=2018-11-24}}</ref> At commercial capacity, the facility currently injects 0.6 MtCO<sub>2</sub> per year, and it has injected a cumulative total of over 1.1 million tonnes over its lifetime.<ref name=":02" />

In October 2009, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] awarded grants to twelve Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage (ICCS) projects to conduct a Phase 1 feasibility study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fossil.energy.gov/recovery/projects/industrial_ccs.html |title=DOE&nbsp;— Fossil Energy: Industrial CCS projects from Recovery Act |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref> The DOE plans to select 3 to 4 of those projects to proceed into Phase 2, design and construction, with operational startup to occur by 2015. [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], Pacific Northwest Division, [[Boise Cascade|Boise]], Inc., and [[Fluor Corporation]] are studying a CCS system for capture and storage of {{co2}} emissions associated with the [[pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper production industry]]. The site of the study is the Boise White Paper L.L.C. paper mill located near the township of [[Wallula]] in Southeastern Washington State. The plant generates approximately 1.2 MMT of {{co2}} annually from a set of three recovery boilers that are mainly fired with [[black liquor]], a recycled byproduct formed during the pulping of wood for paper-making. Fluor Corporation will design a customized version of their Econamine Plus carbon capture technology. The Fluor system also will be designed to remove residual quantities of remnant air pollutants from stack gases as part of the {{co2}} capture process. Battelle is leading preparation of an Environmental Information Volume (EIV) for the entire project, including geologic storage of the captured {{co2}} in deep flood basalt formations that exist in the greater region. The EIV will describe the necessary site characterization work, sequestration system infrastructure, and monitoring program to support permanent sequestration of the {{co2}} captured at the plant.{{update inline|date=February 2018}}

In addition to individual carbon capture and sequestration projects, there are a number of United States programs designed to research, develop, and deploy CCS technologies on a broad scale. These include the [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]]'s (NETL) Carbon Sequestration Program, regional carbon sequestration partnerships and the [[Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum]] (CSLF).<ref>[http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/carbon_seq/index.html NETL Carbon Sequestration] NETL Web site.

===== SECARB =====
In October 2007, the Bureau of Economic Geology at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] received a 10-year, $38 million subcontract to conduct the first intensively monitored long-term project in the United States studying the feasibility of injecting a large volume of {{co2}} for underground storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/102407.html |title=Bureau of Economic Geology Receives $38 Million for First Large-Scale U.S. Test Storing Carbon Dioxide Underground |publisher=Jsg.utexas.edu |date=2007-10-24 |accessdate=2010-04-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182402/http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/102407.html |archivedate=2010-06-11}}</ref> The project is a research program of the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (SECARB), funded by the [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]] of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE).

The SECARB partnership will demonstrate {{co2}} injection rate and storage capacity in the Tuscaloosa-Woodbine geologic system that stretches from Texas to Florida. The region has the potential to store more than 200 billion tons{{Vague|date=September 2008}} of {{co2}} from major point sources in the region, equal to about 33 years of overall United States emissions at present rates. Beginning in fall 2007, the project will inject {{co2}} at the rate of one million tons{{Vague|date=September 2008}} per year, for up to 1.5 years, into brine up to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) below the land surface near the Cranfield oil field, which lays about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Natchez, Mississippi]]. Experimental equipment will measure the ability of the subsurface to accept and retain {{co2}}.

The $1.4 billion [[FutureGen]] power generation and carbon sequestration demonstration project, announced in 2003 by President [[George W. Bush]], was cancelled in 2015, due to delays and inability to raise required private funding.

===== Kemper Project =====

=== Developing projects ===
==== ANICA - Advanced Indirectly Heated Carbonate Looping Process ====
The [https://act-anica.eu/ ANICA Project] is focused on developing economically feasible carbon capture technology for lime and cement plants, which are responsible for 5% of the total [[Carbon dioxide emissions|anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hills |first1=Thomas P. |last2=Sceats |first2=Mark |last3=Rennie |first3=Daniel |last4=Fennell |first4=Paul |title=LEILAC: Low Cost CO2 Capture for the Cement and Lime Industries |journal=Energy Procedia |date=July 2017 |volume=114 |pages=6166–6170 |doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.1753 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Since the year 2019, a consortium of 12 partners from [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Greece]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Partners – ANICA|url=https://act-anica.eu/partners/|access-date=2020-06-23|language=en-US}}</ref> has been working on the developing novel integration concepts of the state-of-the-art indirectly heated carbonate lopping (IHCaL) process in cement and lime production. The project aims at lowering the energy penalty and CO<sub>2</sub> avoidance costs for [[Carbon capture and utilization|CO<sub>2</sub> capture]] from [[Quick lime|lime]] and [[Cement plant|cement]] plants. Within 36 months, the project will bring the IHCaL technology to a high level of technical maturity by carrying out long-term pilot tests in industry-relevant environments and deploying accurate 1D and 3D simulations.

==== Port of Rotterdam CCUS Backbone Initiative ====
Expected in 2021, the Port of Rotterdam CCUS Backbone Initiative aims to implement a "backbone" of shared CCS infrastructure for use by several businesses located around the [[Port of Rotterdam]] in [[Rotterdam|Rotterdam, Netherlands]]. The project, overseen by the Port of Rotterdam, natural gas company [[Gasunie]], and the EBN, looks to capture and sequester 2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year starting in 2020 and increase this number in future years.<ref name=":13">{{Cite news|url=https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/news-and-press-releases/port-authority-gasunie-and-ebn-studying-feasibility-of-ccs-in-rotterdam|title=Port Authority, Gasunie and EBN studying feasibility of CCS in Rotterdam|date=2017-11-06|work=Port of Rotterdam|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}</ref> Although dependent on the participation of companies, the goal of this project is to greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the industrial sector of the Port of Rotterdam and establish a successful CCS infrastructure in the Netherlands following the recently canceled ROAD project. Carbon dioxide captured from local chemical plants and refineries will both be sequestered in the [[North Sea|North Sea seabed]]. The possibility of a CCU initiative has also been considered, in which the captured carbon dioxide will be sold to horticultural firms, who will use it to speed up plant growth, as well as other industrial users.<ref name=":13" />

=== Alternative carbon capture methods ===
Although the majority of industrial carbon capture is done using post-combustion capture, several notable projects exist that utilize a variety of alternative capture methods. Several smaller-scale pilot and demonstration plants have been constructed for research and testing using these methods, and a handful of proposed projects are in early development on an industrial scale. Some of the most notable alternative carbon capture projects include:

==== Climeworks Direct Air Capture Plant and CarbFix2 Project ====
[[Climeworks]] opened the first commercial [[direct air capture]] plant in [[Zürich|Zürich, Switzerland]]. Their process involves capturing carbon dioxide directly from ambient air using a patented filter, isolating the captured carbon dioxide at high heat, and finally transporting it to a nearby [[greenhouse]] as a [[fertilizer]]. The plant is built near a waste recovery facility that uses its excess heat to power the Climeworks plant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.climeworks.com/world-first-co2-capture-plant/|title=Climeworks makes history with world-first commercial CO2 capture plant {{!}} Climeworks – Capturing CO2 from Air|website=www.climeworks.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>

Climeworks is also working with [[Reykjavik Energy]] on the CarbFix2 project with funding from the European Union. This project, located in Hellisheidi, Iceland, uses direct air capture technology to geologically store carbon dioxide by operating in conjunction with a large [[Geothermal power|geothermal power plant]]. Once carbon dioxide is captured using Climeworks' filters, it is heated using heat from the geothermal plant and bound to water. The geothermal plant then pumps the carbonated water into rock formations underground where the carbon dioxide reacts with [[Basalt|basaltic bedrock]] and forms [[Carbonate minerals|carbonite minerals]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.climeworks.com/climeworks-and-carbfix2-the-worlds-first-carbon-removal-solution-through-direct-air-capture/|title=Climeworks and CarbFix2: The world's first carbon removal solution through direct air capture {{!}} Climeworks – Capturing CO2 from Air|website=www.climeworks.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>

==== Duke Energy East Bend Station ====
Researchers at the Center for Applied Energy Research of the [[University of Kentucky]] are currently{{when|date=June 2019}} developing the algae-mediated conversion of coal-fired power plant flue gas to drop-in hydrocarbon fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/environment/global-climate-change/carbon-capture-and-storage|title=Carbon Capture & Storage - Environment - Duke Energy|website=Duke Energy|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref> Through their work, these researchers have proven that the carbon dioxide within [[flue gas]] from [[coal-fired power plants]] can be captured using algae, which can be subsequently harvested and utilized, e.g. as a feedstock for the production of drop-in hydrocarbon fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/emerging_hydrocarbon.html|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Renewable Hydrocarbon Biofuels|website=afdc.energy.gov|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>

==== OPEN100 ====
The OPEN100 project, launched in 2020 by The Energy Impact Center (EIC), is the world’s first open-source blueprint for nuclear power plant deployment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.open-100.com/|access-date=2020-11-19|website=www.open-100.com}}</ref> The Energy Impact Center and OPEN100 aim to reverse climate change by 2040 and believe that nuclear power is the only energy source adequate enough to power carbon capture and sequestration without the compromise of releasing any new CO2 into the atmosphere in the process, thus solving for global warming.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Energy Impact Center {{!}} Climate Change {{!}} Washington, DC|url=https://www.energyimpactcenter.org/|access-date=2020-11-19|website=energyimpactcenter|language=en}}</ref>

This project intends to bring together researchers, designers, scientists, engineers, think tanks, etc. to help compile research and designs that will eventually evolve into a fully detailed blueprint that’s available to the public and can be utilized in the development of future nuclear plants.

== Use for heavy industry ==
In some countries, such as the UK, although CCS will be trialled for gas-fired power stations it will also be considered to help with decarbonization of industry and heating.<ref name="BEIS" />

== Cost ==
Cost is a significant factor affecting whether or not CCS is implemented. The cost of CCS, minus any subsidies, must be less than the expected cost of emitting CO2 for a project to be considered economically favorable.

Several different metrics are used to quantify the cost of CCS, which can cause confusion because many have the same units of cost per mass of CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Edward S.|date=September 2012|title=Understanding the pitfalls of CCS cost estimates|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1750583612001302|journal=International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control|language=en|volume=10|pages=181–190|doi=10.1016/j.ijggc.2012.06.004}}</ref> For this reason it is important to understand which metric a given source uses so it can be correctly compared to other values. The most commonly used metric is the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> avoided, which is calculated with the following equation.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="IPCC_CC" />

<math>Cost_{avoided} = \frac{COE_{CCS} - COE_{ref}} {CO_{2,ref} - CO_{2,CCS}}</math>

In this equation ''COE'' is the cost of electricity for the plant with CCS and the reference plant. The reference plant is usually the same plant, but without CCS. Some sources use the [[levelized cost of electricity]]. Generally, the cost of transporting and storing the CO2 is also included in the cost of electricity since CO2 emissions are not truly avoided until it is stored, although not always.<ref name=":0" /> In the denominator CO<sub>2</sub> is the mass of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per unit of net electricity produced (e.g. USD/MWh). This is generally the metric used because most discussions revolve around reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and "mitigation cost is best represented as avoided cost".<ref name="IPCC_CC" /> Another common metric is the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> captured, which is defined by the following equation.<ref name="IPCC_CC" /><ref name=":0" />

<math>Cost_{capture} = \frac{COE_{CCS} - COE_{ref}} {CO_{2,captured}}</math>

The numerator is similar to that used for the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> avoided, except that only the cost of capture is included (transportation and storage costs are excluded). However, the denominator is the total amount of CO2 '''captured''' per unit of net electricity produced. Although at first this may appear to be the same as the amount of CO2 avoided, the amount of CO2 captured is actually more than the amount avoided.<ref name="IPCC_CC" /> The reason is that capturing CO2 requires energy, and if that energy comes from fossil fuels (which is usually the case because it comes from the same plant) then more fuel must be burned to produce the same amount of electricity. This means more CO2 is produced per MWh in the CCS plant than in the reference plant. In other words, the cost of CO2 captured does not fully take into account the reduced efficiency of the plant with CCS. For this reason the cost of CO2 captured is always lower than the cost of CO2 avoided and does not describe the full cost of CCS.<ref name="IPCC_CC" /><ref name=":0" /> Some sources also report the increase in the cost of electricity as a way to evaluate the economic impact of CCS.<ref name=":0" />

The reasons that CCS is expected to cause price increases if used on gas-fired power plants are several. Firstly, the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing {{co2}} significantly raises the operating costs of CCS-equipped power plants. In addition, there are added investment and capital costs.

The increased energy required for the carbon capturing process is also called an energy penalty. It has been estimated that about 60% of the energy penalty originates from the capture process itself, 30% comes from compression of {{CO2}}, while the remaining 10% comes from electricity requirements for necessary pumps and fans.<ref name="Rubin2012">{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Edward S.|last2=Mantripragada|first2=Hari|last3=Marks|first3=Aaron|last4=Versteeg|first4=Peter|last5=Kitchin|first5=John|date=October 2012|title=The outlook for improved carbon capture technology|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|volume=38|issue=5|pages=630–671|doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2012.03.003}}</ref> CCS technology is expected to use between 10 and 40 percent of the energy produced by a power station.<ref name="falsehope">Rochon, Emily et al.

And as with most chemical plants, constructing CCS units is capital intensive. Pre-commercial CCS demonstration projects are likely to be more expensive than mature CCS technology; the total additional costs of an early large-scale CCS demonstration project are estimated to be €0.5–1.1 billion per project over the project lifetime. Other applications are possible.

{{As of|2018}} a [[carbon price]] of at least 100 euros has been estimated to be needed for industrial CCS to be viable<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-09-27|title=Call for open debate on CCU and CCS to save industry emissions|url=https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/call-open-debate-ccu-and-ccs-save-industry-emissions|access-date=2019-06-17|website=Clean Energy Wire|language=en}}</ref> together with [[carbon tariff]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Butler|first=Clark|date=July 2020|title=Carbon Capture and Storage Is About Reputation, Not Economics|url=https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CCS-Is-About-Reputation-Not-Economics_July-2020.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=[[IEEFA]]}}</ref>

According to UK government estimates made in the late 2010s, carbon capture (without storage) is estimated to add 7 GBP per Mwh by 2025 to the cost of electricity from a modern [[gas-fired power plant]]: however most CO2 will need to be stored so in total the increase in cost for gas or biomass generated electricity is around 50%.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Energy|url=https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/newsspec/pdfs/bbc-briefing-energy-newsspec-25305-v1.pdf|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

=== Financing CCS via the Clean Development Mechanism ===
One way to finance future CCS projects could be through the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. At [[COP16]] in 2010, The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, at its thirty-third session, issued a draft document recommending the inclusion of Carbon dioxide capture and storage in geological formations in Clean Development Mechanism project activities.<ref>[http://abclive.in/news/environment/clean-engergy/490-sbsta-global-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-data-cop16.html SBSTA Presents Global Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage Data at COP16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728190701/http://abclive.in/news/environment/clean-engergy/490-sbsta-global-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-data-cop16.html|date=28 July 2011}}</ref> At [[COP17]] in [[Durban]], a final agreement was reached enabling CCS projects to receive support through the Clean Development Mechanism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bonner|first=Mark|title=CCS enters the CDM at CMP 7|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/community/blogs/authors/markbonner/2011/12/10/ccs-enters-cdm-cmp-7|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130124063149/http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/community/blogs/authors/markbonner/2011/12/10/ccs-enters-cdm-cmp-7|archivedate=24 January 2013|accessdate=7 May 2012|publisher=Global CCS Institute}}</ref>

== Environmental effects ==

=== Gas-fired power plants ===

The theoretical merit of CCS systems is the reduction of {{co2}} emissions by up to 90%, depending on plant type. Generally, environmental effects from use of CCS arise during power production, {{co2}} capture, transport, and storage. Issues relating to storage are discussed in those sections. More recently is increasing interest in the use of [[methane pyrolysis]] to convert natural gas to hydrogen for gas-fired power plants preventing production of CO2 and eliminating the need for CCS.

Additional energy is required for {{co2}} capture, and this means that substantially more fuel has to be used to produce the same amount of power, depending on the plant type. The extra energy requirements for natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants range from 11–22% [IPCC, 2005].<ref>{{cite web|title=IPCC Special Report: Carbon Capture and Storage Technical Summary. IPCC. p. 27|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101215706/http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-01|accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> Obviously, fuel use and environmental problems arising from extraction of gas increase accordingly.

In 2005 the IPCC provided estimates of air emissions from various CCS plant designs. While {{co2}} is drastically reduced though never completely captured, emissions of air pollutants increase significantly, generally due to the energy penalty of capture. Hence, the use of CCS entails a reduction in air quality. Type and amount of air pollutants still depends on technology. {{CO2}} is captured with alkaline solvents catching the acidic {{CO2}} at low temperatures in the absorber and releasing {{CO2}} at higher temperatures in a desorber. Chilled Ammonia CCS Plants have inevitable ammonia emissions to air. "Functionalized Ammonia" emit less ammonia, but amines may form secondary amines and these will emit volatile nitrosamines<ref name="ekopolitan.com">{{cite web|title=CCS - Norway: Amines, nitrosamines and nitramines released in Carbon Capture Processes should not exceed 0.3 ng/m3 air (The Norwegian Institute of Public Health) - ekopolitan|url=http://www.ekopolitan.com/news/ccs-norway-amines-nitrosamines-and-nitramines-released-carbon-capture-proce|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923234730/http://www.ekopolitan.com/news/ccs-norway-amines-nitrosamines-and-nitramines-released-carbon-capture-proce|archive-date=2015-09-23|access-date=2012-12-19|website=www.ekopolitan.com}}</ref> by a side reaction with nitrogendioxide, which is present in any flue gas even after DeNOx. Nevertheless, there are advanced amines in testing with little to no vapor pressure to avoid these amine- and consecutive nitrosamine emissions.

=== Coal-fired power plants ===

According to one 2020 study half as much CCS might be installed in coal-fired plants compared to gas-fired: they would be mainly in China with some in India.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Powering through the coming energy transition|url=https://news.mit.edu/2020/powering-through-coming-energy-transition-1118|access-date=2020-11-20|website=MIT News {{!}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology|language=en}}</ref> The theoretical merit of CCS systems is the reduction of {{co2}} emissions by up to 90%, depending on plant type.

Additional energy is required for {{co2}} capture, and this means that substantially more fuel has to be used to produce the same amount of power, depending on the plant type. For new super-critical pulverized coal (PC) plants using current technology, the extra energy requirements range from 24 to 40%, while for coal-based gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems it is 14–25% [IPCC, 2005].<ref>{{cite web|title=IPCC Special Report: Carbon Capture and Storage Technical Summary.

In 2005 the IPCC provided estimates of air emissions from various CCS plant designs.

Nevertheless, there are advanced amines in testing with little to no vapor pressure to avoid these amine- and consecutive nitrosamine emissions. Nevertheless, all the capture plants amines have in common, that practically 100% of remaining sulfur dioxide from the plant is washed out of the flue gas, the same applies to dust/ash.

== Leakage ==
===Long term retainment of stored {{CO2}} ===
For well-selected, designed and managed geological storage sites, IPCC estimates that leakage risks are comparable to those associated with current hydrocarbon activity.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPCC Special Report: Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Technical Summary|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005090148/http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-05|accessdate=2011-10-05|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}</ref> However, this finding is contested due to a lack of experience in such long-term storage.<ref>{{cite web|date=March 2013|title=Comparison of carbon capture and storage with renewable energy technologies regarding structural, economic, and ecological aspects in Germany|url=http://www.dlr.de/tt/en/Portaldata/41/Resources/dokumente/institut/system/publications/JGGC_CCS_Paper_Viebahn_etal.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=March 2013|title=University of Sydney: Global warming effect of leakage from CO2 storage|url=http://www.isa.org.usyd.edu.au/publications/ISA_CCSleakage.pdf}}</ref> {{co2}} could be trapped for millions of years, and although some leakage occurs upwards through the soil, well selected storage sites are likely to retain over 99% of the injected {{co2}} over 1000 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010 - Storage Security|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-beccs-projects-2010/online/27051#storage-security|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519131259/http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-beccs-projects-2010/online/27051#storage-security|archive-date=2013-05-19|accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref> Leakage through the injection pipe is a greater risk.<ref>[http://plein66.nl/documents/1024/artikel_CO2-opslag.pdf Natuurwetenschap & Techniek; April 2009; CCS leakage risks] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Mineral storage is not regarded as having any risks of leakage. The IPCC recommends that limits be set to the amount of leakage that can take place.

To further investigate the safety of {{co2}} sequestration, Norway's [[Sleipner gas field]] can be studied, as it is the oldest plant that stores {{co2}} on an industrial scale. According to an environmental assessment of the gas field which was conducted after ten years of operation, the author affirmed that geosequestration of {{co2}} was the most definite form of permanent ''geological'' storage of {{co2}}:
<blockquote>Available geological information shows absence of major tectonic events after the deposition of the Utsira formation [saline reservoir].

===Hazards from sudden accidental leakage of {{CO2}}===
CCS schemes will involve handling and transportation of {{CO2}} on a hitherto unprecedented scale. A CCS project for a single standard 1,000 MW coal-fired power plant will require capture and transportation of 30,000 tonnes {{CO2}} per day to the storage site.  Transmission pipelines may leak or rupture.  Pipelines can be fitted with remotely controlled block valves that upon closure will limit the release quantity to the inventory of an isolatable section.  For example, a severed 19" pipeline section 8&nbsp;km long may release 1,300 tonnes of carbon dioxide in about 3–4 min.<ref name="Menzengraben">{{cite journal|last1=Hedlund|first1=Frank Huess|year=2012|title=The extreme carbon dioxide outburst at the Menzengraben potash mine 7 July 1953|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/7931421/Menzen_53_submit_to_Orbit_.pdf|journal=Safety Science|volume=50|issue=3|pages=537–53|doi=10.1016/j.ssci.2011.10.004}}</ref> At the storage site, the injection pipe can be fitted with [[non-return valve]]s to prevent an uncontrolled release from the reservoir in case of upstream pipeline damage.

Large-scale releases of {{CO2}} presents asphyxiation risk. In 1953, a release of several thousand tonnes of {{CO2}} - a quantity comparable to an accidental release from a CCS {{CO2}} transmission pipeline - from the [[1953 Menzengraben mining accident|Menzengraben salt mine]] killed a person at distance of 300 meters due to asphyxiation.<ref name="Menzengraben" />  Malfunction of a carbon dioxide industrial fire suppression system in a large warehouse released 50 t {{CO2}} after which 14 citizens collapsed on the nearby public road.<ref name="Menzengraben" /> The [[Berkel en Rodenrijs]] incident in December 2008 was another example, where a modest release of {{CO2}} from a pipeline under a bridge resulted in the deaths of some ducks sheltering there.<ref name="eenden">{{cite web|date=March 2013|title=Eendensterfte door lek in CO2-leiding (Duck deaths from leaking CO2 pipeline)|url=http://www.berkelenrodenrijs.net/main.php?lees=3329}} (in Dutch)</ref> In order to measure accidental carbon releases more accurately and decrease the risk of fatalities through this type of leakage, the implementation of {{co2}} alert meters around the project perimeter has been proposed {{by whom|date=June 2020}}. The most extreme sudden {{CO2}} release on record took place in 1986 at [[Lake Nyos]].

== Monitoring geological sequestration sites ==

In order to detect carbon dioxide leaks and the effectiveness of geological sequestration sites, different monitoring techniques can be employed to verify that the sequestered carbon stays trapped below the surface in the intended reservoir. Leakage due to injection at improper locations or conditions could result in carbon dioxide being released back into the atmosphere. It is important to be able to detect leaks with enough warning to put a stop to it, and to be able to quantify the amount of carbon that has leaked for purposes such as [[cap and trade]] policies, evaluation of environmental impact of leaked carbon, as well as accounting for the total loss and cost of the process. To quantify the amount of carbon dioxide released, should a leak occur, or to closely watch stored {{co2}}, there are several monitoring methods that can be done at both the surface and subsurface levels.<ref name="main">{{cite book|last1=Smit|first1=Berend|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration|last2=Reimer|first2=Jeffery A.|last3=Oldenburg|first3=Curtis M.|last4=Bourg|first4=Ian C.|publisher=Imperial College Press|edition=The Berkeley Lectures on Energy - Vol. 1}}</ref>

=== Subsurface monitoring ===
In subsurface monitoring, there are direct and indirect methods to determine the amount of {{co2}} in the reservoir. A direct method would be drilling deep enough to collect a fluid sample. This drilling can be difficult and expensive due to the physical properties of the rock. It also only provides data at a specific location. Indirect methods would be to send sound or electromagnetic waves down to the reservoir where it is then reflected back up to be interpreted. This approach is also expensive but it provides data over a much larger region; it does however lack precision. Both direct and indirect monitoring can be done intermittently or continuously.<ref name="main" />

=== Seismic monitoring ===
[[Seismometer|Seismic monitoring]] is a type of indirect subsurface monitoring. It is done by creating vibrational waves either at the surface using a [[Seismic vibrator|vibroseis truck]], or inside a well using [[Rotating unbalance|spinning eccentric mass]].  These vibrational waves then propagate through the geological layers and reflect back creating patterns that are read and interpreted by seismometers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Biondi|first1=Biondo|last2=de Ridder|first2=Sjoerd|last3=Chang|first3=Jason|date=2013|title=Continuous passive - seismic monitoring of CO2 geologic sequestration projects|url=https://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/TechReports2013/5.2_Biondi_Public_Version_2013.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> It can identify migration pathways of the {{co2}} plume.<ref>{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Monitoring for CCS Projects|url=http://ieaghg.org/member/49-publications/technical-reports/590-2015-02-review-of-offshore-monitoring-for-ccs-projects|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603062639/http://ieaghg.org/member/49-publications/technical-reports/590-2015-02-review-of-offshore-monitoring-for-ccs-projects|archive-date=3 June 2016|accessdate=6 May 2016|website=IEAGHG|publisher=IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Two examples of monitoring geological sequestration sites using seismic monitoring are the [[Sleipner gas field|Sleipner sequestration project]] and the Frio {{co2}} Injection test. Although this method can confirm the presence of {{co2}} in a given region, it cannot determine the specifics of the environment or concentration of {{co2}}.

=== Surface monitoring ===

[[Eddy covariance]] is a surface monitoring technique that measures the flux of {{co2}} from the ground's surface. It involves measuring {{co2}} concentrations as well as vertical wind velocities using an anemometer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madsen|first1=Rod|last2=Xu|first2=Liukang|last3=Claassen|first3=Brent|last4=McDermitt|first4=Dayle|date=February 2009|title=Surface Monitoring Method for Carbon Capture and Storage Projects|journal=Energy Procedia|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2161–2168|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2009.01.281|doi-access=free}}</ref> This provides a measure of the total vertical flux of {{co2}}. Eddy covariance towers could potentially detect leaks, however, the natural carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and the respiration of plants, would have to be accounted for and a baseline {{co2}} cycle would have to be developed for the location of monitoring. An example of Eddy covariance techniques used to monitor carbon sequestration sites is the Shallow Release test.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Trautz|first1=Robert C.|last2=Pugh|first2=John D.|last3=Varadharajan|first3=Charuleka|last4=Zheng|first4=Liange|last5=Bianchi|first5=Marco|last6=Nico|first6=Peter S.|last7=Spycher|first7=Nicolas F.|last8=Newell|first8=Dennis L.|last9=Esposito|first9=Richard A.|last10=Wu|first10=Yuxin|last11=Dafflon|first11=Baptiste|date=20 September 2012|title=Effect of Dissolved CO2 on a Shallow Groundwater System: A Controlled Release Field Experiment|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=47|issue=1|pages=298–305|doi=10.1021/es301280t|pmid=22950750|last12=Hubbard|first12=Susan S.|last13=Birkholzer|first13=Jens T.}}</ref> Another similar approach is utilizing accumulation chambers. These chambers are sealed to the ground with an inlet and outlet flow stream connected to a gas analyzer.<ref name="main" /> This also measures the vertical flux of {{co2}}. The disadvantage of accumulation chambers is its inability to monitor a large region which is necessary in detecting {{co2}} leaks over the entire sequestration site.

=== InSAR monitoring ===
[[InSAR]] monitoring is another type of surface monitoring. It involves a satellite sending signals down to the Earth's surface where it is reflected back to the satellite's receiver. From this, the satellite is able to measure the distance to that point.<ref name="insar">{{cite web|title=InSAR—Satellite-based technique captures overall deformation "picture"|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/insar.html|accessdate=6 May 2016|website=USGS Science for a Changing World|publisher=US Geological Survey}}</ref> In CCS, the injection of {{co2}} in deep sublayers of geological sites creates high pressures. These high pressured, fluid filled layers affect those above and below it resulting in a change of the surface landscape. In areas of stored {{co2}}, the ground's surface often rises due to the high pressures originating in the deep subsurface layers. These changes in elevation of the Earth's surface corresponds to a change in the distance from the inSAR satellite which is then detectable and measurable.<ref name="insar" />

== Political debate ==
CCS has met some political opposition from critics who say large-scale CCS deployment is risky and expensive and that a better option is [[renewable energy]] and dispatchable [[methane pyrolysis]] turbine power. Some environmental groups have said there is a risk of leakage during the extremely long storage time required, so have compared CCS technology to storing dangerous [[radioactive waste]] from [[nuclear power station]]s.<ref name = ti12>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1954176_1954175_1955868,00.html |title=Cutting Carbon: Should We Capture and Store It? |author=Simon Robinson |date=22 January 2012 |work=TIME }}</ref>

The use of CCS could reduce {{CO2}} emissions from the stacks of coal power plants by 85–90% or more, but it has no effect on {{CO2}} emissions due to the mining and transport of coal. It will actually "increase such emissions and of air pollutants per unit of net delivered power and will increase all ecological, land-use, air-pollution, and water-pollution impacts from coal mining, transport, and processing, because the CCS system requires 25% more energy, thus 25% more coal combustion, than does a system without CCS".<ref name="WWS2010">{{cite web|url=https://www.univie.ac.at/photovoltaik/vorlesung/ss2014/unit2/Energy_policy2010.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z. |author2=Delucchi, Mark A. |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=4 }}</ref>

Additionally, when the net energy efficiencies of CCS fossil-fuel power plants and renewable electricity were compared, a 2019 study found CCS plants to be less effective. The electrical [[Energy returned on energy invested|energy returned on energy invested ratios]] (EROEI) of both production methods were estimated, accounting for their operational and infrastructural energy costs. Renewable electricity production included solar and wind with sufficient energy storage plus dispatchable electricity production. Thus, in climate crisis mitigation, rapid expansion of scalable renewable electricity and storage would be preferable over fossil-fuel CCS.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sgouridis |first1=Sgouris |last2=Carbajales-Dale |first2=Michael |last3=Csala |first3=Denes |last4=Chiesa |first4=Matteo |last5=Bardi |first5=Ugo |title=Comparative net energy analysis of renewable electricity and carbon capture and storage |journal=Nature Energy |date=8 April 2019 |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=456–465 |doi=10.1038/s41560-019-0365-7 |s2cid=134169612 |url=https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/133171/1/5890_4_art_0_pnk0xh.pdf }}</ref>

On one hand, [[Greenpeace]] claims that CCS could lead to a doubling of coal plant costs.<ref name="falsehope"/> It is also claimed by opponents to CCS that money spent on CCS will divert investments away from other solutions to climate change. On the other hand, [[BECCS]] is  used in some [[IPCC]] scenarios to help meet [[Climate change mitigation scenarios|mitigation targets]] such as 1.5 degrees C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/summary-for-policy-makers/|title=Summary for Policymakers — Global Warming of 1.5 ºC|access-date=2019-06-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531192512/https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/summary-for-policy-makers/|archive-date=2019-05-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>
