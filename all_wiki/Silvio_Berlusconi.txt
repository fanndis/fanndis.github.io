== Business career ==
=== Milano Due ===
{{main|Milano Due}}
Berlusconi's business career began in construction. In the late 1960s, he built [[Milano Due]] (Italian for "Milan Two"), a development of 4,000 residential apartments east of [[Milan]]. It was a residential centre in the [[Italy|Italian]] town of [[Segrate]] and was built as a [[new town]] by Edilnord, a Berlusconi owned company associated with the [[Fininvest]] group.

The main peculiarity of Milano Due is a system of walkways and bridges that connects the whole neighbourhood, so that it is possible to walk around without ever intersecting traffic.  The works started in 1970, and were completed in 1979. Distinctive landmarks are the sporting facilities, a small artificial lake and a children's playground.

The profits from this venture provided the seed money for his advertising agency.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Carlin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/18/italy.features |title=Silvio Berlusconi: Roman emperor for the 21st century &#124; World news &#124; The Observer |newspaper=Guardian |date=19 January 2004 |access-date=27 October 2012 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116133228/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jan/18/italy.features |archive-date=16 January 2013}}</ref>

=== TeleMilano ===
Berlusconi first entered the media world in 1973, by setting up a small cable television company, TeleMilano, to service units built on his Segrate properties. It began transmitting in September the following year. TeleMilano was the first Italian private television channel, and later evolved into [[Canale 5]], the first national private TV station.

After buying two further channels, Berlusconi relocated the station to central Milan in 1977 and began broadcasting over the airwaves.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mastellarini |first=Gabriele |title=Assalto alla stampa: Controllare i media per governare l'opinione pubblica |publisher=Dedalo |location=Bari |year=2003 |pages=159ff}}
</ref>

=== Fininvest ===
{{main|Fininvest}}
[[File:Berlusconi anni 80.jpg|thumb|right|Berlusconi in his private [[jet aircraft|jet]], in the 1980s]]
In 1978, Berlusconi founded his first media group, [[Fininvest]], and joined the [[Propaganda Due]] masonic lodge. In the five years leading up to 1983 he earned some 113&nbsp;billion [[Italian lira|Italian lire]] ([[euro|€]]58.3&nbsp;million). The funding sources are still unknown because of a complex system of [[holding company|holding companies]], despite investigations conducted by various [[state attorney]]s.

Fininvest soon expanded into a country-wide network of local TV stations which had similar programming, forming, in effect, a single national network. This was seen as breaching the Italian public broadcaster [[RAI]]'s statutory monopoly by creating a national network, which was later abolished. In 1980, Berlusconi founded Italy's first private national network, [[Canale 5]], followed shortly thereafter by [[Italia 1]], which was bought from the Rusconi family in 1982, and [[Rete 4]], which was bought from [[Mondadori]] in 1984.<ref name="lunita" /> He then launched three international sister networks: [[La Cinq]] (which began operations in 1986), [[Tele 5]] (which launched in 1988), and [[Telecinco]] (which launched in 1989). La Cinq and Tele 5 ceased operations in 1992 and were later replaced by [[France 5|La Cinquième]] and [[Sport1 (Germany)|DSF]], respectively.

Berlusconi created the first and only Italian commercial TV empire. He was assisted by his connections to [[Bettino Craxi]], secretary-general of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] and also prime minister of Italy at that time, whose government passed, on 20 October 1984, an emergency decree legalising the nationwide transmissions made by Berlusconi's television stations.<ref name="lunita">{{cite web |url=http://www.articolo21.info/499/editoriale/berlusconi-tv-un-impero-nato-per-decretocraxi.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20101215023228/http://www.articolo21.info/499/editoriale/berlusconi-tv-un-impero-nato-per-decretocraxi.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 December 2010 |title=Berlusconi- tv. Un impero nato per decreto-Craxi |language=it |publisher=[[l'Unità]]}}</ref> This was in response to judgements on 16 October 1984, in [[Turin]], [[Pescara]] and [[Rome]], enforcing a law which previously restricted nationwide broadcasting to RAI, that had ordered these private networks to cease transmitting.

After political turmoil in 1985, the decree was approved definitively. But for some years, Berlusconi's three channels remained in a legal limbo, and were not allowed to broadcast news and political commentary. They were elevated to the status of full national TV channels in 1990, by the so-called [[Oscar Mammì|Mammì law]].

== Political career ==
{{Main|Political career of Silvio Berlusconi}}
Berlusconi rapidly rose to the forefront of Italian politics in January 1994. He was elected to the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] for the first time and appointed as Prime Minister following the [[1994 Italian general election|1994 parliamentary elections]], when Forza Italia gained a relative majority a mere three months after having been launched. However, his cabinet collapsed after nine months, due to internal disagreements among the coalition parties. In the [[1996 Italian general election|April 1996 snap parliamentary elections]], Berlusconi was defeated by the centre-left candidate [[Romano Prodi]]. In the [[2001 Italian general election|May 2001 parliamentary elections]], he was again the centre-right candidate for Prime Minister and won against the centre-left candidate [[Francesco Rutelli]]. Berlusconi then formed his second and third cabinets, until 2006. Berlusconi was leader of the centre-right coalition in the [[2006 Italian general election|April 2006 parliamentary elections]], which he lost by a very narrow margin, his opponent again being Romano Prodi. He was re-elected in the [[2008 Italian general election|parliamentary elections of April 2008]] following the collapse of [[Prodi II Cabinet|Prodi's government]] and sworn in for a third time as Prime Minister on 8 May 2008.

After losing his majority in parliament amid growing fiscal problems related to the [[European debt crisis]], Berlusconi [[Resignation of Silvio Berlusconi|resigned]] as Prime Minister on 16 November 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15708729 |title=Italy crisis: Silvio Berlusconi resigns as PM |work=BBC News |date=13 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128202636/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15708729 |archive-date=28 November 2013}} [[BBC News]] 12 November 2011.</ref> In February 2013 Berlusconi has led the People of Freedom and its [[right-wing]] allies in the campaign for the [[2013 Italian general election|parliamentary elections]].

=== Beginnings ===
[[File:Silvio Berlusconi May 1994.jpg|thumb|right|Berlusconi during a meeting in May 1994]]
Berlusconi's political career began in 1994, when he entered politics, reportedly admitting to [[Indro Montanelli]]  and [[Enzo Biagi]]  that he was forced to do so to avoid imprisonment.<ref name="Peretz Rampini">Evgenia Peretz (with [[Federico Rampini]]) [https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2011/07/silvio-berlusconi-201107 ''La Dolce Viagra,''] at [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], July 2011 "I am forced to enter politics, otherwise they will put me in prison." {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414235103/http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2011/07/silvio-berlusconi-201107 |date=14 April 2014 }}</ref> He subsequently served as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] from 1994 to 1995, 2001 to 2006, and 2008 to 2011. His career was racked with [[Controversies surrounding Silvio Berlusconi|controversies]] and [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi|trials]]; amongst these was his failure to honour his promise to sell his personal assets in [[Mediaset]], the largest television broadcaster in Italy, in order to dispel any perceived [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]].

In the early 1990s, the ''[[Pentapartito]]'' – the five governing parties, [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (''Democrazia Cristiana''), the [[Italian Socialist Party]], the [[Italian Social-Democratic Party]], the [[Italian Republican Party]] and the [[Italian Liberal Party]] – lost much of their electoral strength almost overnight due to a large number of judicial investigations concerning the financial corruption of many of their foremost members (see the [[Mani Pulite]] affair). This led to a general expectation that upcoming elections would be won by the [[Democratic Party of the Left]], the heirs to the former [[Italian Communist Party]], and their [[Alliance of Progressives]] coalition – unless an alternative arose. On 26 January 1994, Berlusconi announced his decision to enter politics, ("enter the field", in his own words) presenting his own political party, [[Forza Italia]], on a platform focused on defeating ''[[communism|the Communists]]''. His political aim was to convince the voters of the Pentapartito, who were shocked and confused by [[Mani Pulite]] scandals, that [[Forza Italia]] offered both a fresh uniqueness and the continuation of the pro-western free market policies followed by Italy since the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Shortly after he decided to enter the political arena, investigators into the [[Mani Pulite]] affair were said to be close to issuing warrants for the arrest of Berlusconi and senior executives of his business group. During his political career Berlusconi repeatedly stated that the Mani Pulite investigations were led by communist [[prosecutors]] who wanted to establish a [[Soviet Union|soviet]]-style government in Italy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://courses.wcupa.edu/rbove/eco343/060compecon/Europe%20West/Italy/060330berlusc.txt |title=As Italy Votes, Golden Career Of Berlusconi Is at Crossroads |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=30 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921051738/http://courses.wcupa.edu/rbove/eco343/060compecon/Europe%20West/Italy/060330berlusc.txt |archive-date=21 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?article=385&p=2 |title=Italian Election, The Prelude |publisher=[[The American (magazine)|The American]] |date=1 April 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222014325/http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?article=385&p=2 |archive-date=22 February 2014}}</ref>

=== 1994 electoral victory ===
{{main|Italian general election, 1994}}
[[File:Berlusconi-comizio.jpg|thumb|left|Berlusconi during a [[Forza Italia]] rally]]

In order to win the [[1994 Italian general election|March 1994 general election]], Berlusconi formed two separate electoral alliances: [[Pole of Freedoms]] (''Polo delle Libertà'') with the [[Lega Nord]] (''Northern League'') in northern Italian districts, and another, the [[Pole of Good Government]] (''Polo del Buon Governo''), with the [[Alleanza Nazionale|National Alliance]] (''Alleanza Nazionale''; heir to the [[Italian Social Movement]]) in central and southern regions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Griffin |first=Roger| author-link = Roger Griffin |quote='AN's ideological tap-root is still thrust deep into historical Fascism... retaining many Fascist core values |title=The 'Post-Fascism' of the Alleanza Nazionale: A Case Study in Ideological Morphology |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=123–145 |year=1996 |doi=10.1080/13569319608420733}}</ref> In a pragmatic move, he did not ally with the latter in the North because the League disliked them. As a result, [[Forza Italia]] was allied with two parties that were not allied with each other.

Berlusconi launched a massive campaign of electoral advertisements on his three TV networks, and preparing his top advertising salesmen with seminars and screen tests, of whom 50 were subsequently elected despite an absence legislative experience.<ref name="Peretz Rampini"/> He subsequently won the elections, with [[Forza Italia]] garnering 21% of the popular vote, more than any other single party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elezionistorico.interno.it/liste.php?tp=C&dt=27/03/1994&cta=I&tpEnte=A&tpSeg=C&numEnte=0&sut1=&sut2=&sut3=&descEnte=&descArea=ITALIA&codTipoSegLeader= |title=Elezioni della Camera dei Deputati del 27 Marzo 1994 |language=it |publisher=[[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612091446/http://elezionistorico.interno.it/liste.php?tp=C&dt=27%2F03%2F1994&cta=I&tpEnte=A&tpSeg=C&numEnte=0&sut1=&sut2=&sut3=&descEnte=&descArea=ITALIA&codTipoSegLeader= |archive-date=12 June 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One of the most significant promises that he made in order to secure victory was that his government would create "one million more jobs". He was appointed Prime Minister in 1994, but his term in office was short because of the inherent contradictions in his coalition: the League, a regional party with a strong electoral base in northern Italy, was at that time fluctuating between [[federalist]] and [[separatist]] positions, and the National Alliance was a [[nationalist]] party that had yet to renounce [[neo-fascism]] at the time.

=== Fall of the Berlusconi I cabinet ===
In December 1994, following the leaking to the press of news of a fresh investigation by Milan magistrates, [[Umberto Bossi]], leader of the [[Lega Nord]], left the coalition claiming that the [[electoral pact]] had not been respected, forcing Berlusconi to resign from office and shifting the majority's weight to the centre-left. Lega Nord also resented the fact that many of its MPs had switched to Forza Italia, allegedly lured by promises of more prestigious portfolios. In 1998, various articles attacking Berlusconi were published by Lega Nord's official newspaper ''[[La Padania]]'', with titles such as "La Fininvest è nata da Cosa Nostra"&nbsp;– "Fininvest (Berlusconi's principal company) was founded by the Mafia".

Berlusconi remained as caretaker prime minister for a little over a month, until his replacement by a technocratic government headed by [[Lamberto Dini]]. Dini had been a key minister in the Berlusconi cabinet, and Berlusconi said the only way he would support a technocratic government would be if Dini headed it. In the end, however, Dini was supported by most of the opposition parties, but not by Forza Italia and Lega Nord.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Organization of Political Parties in Southern Europe|last=Piero Ignazi, Colette Ysmal|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=9780275956127|pages=106}}</ref> In 1996, Berlusconi and his coalition lost the elections and were replaced by a centre-left government led by [[Romano Prodi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forza-italia.it/notizie/int_2817.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313005130/http://www.forza-italia.it/notizie/int_2817.htm |archive-date=13 March 2007 |title=The First Seven Years Of Forza Italia}}</ref>

=== 2001 electoral victory ===
{{main|Italian general election, 2001}}
In 2001, Berlusconi ran again, as leader of the right-wing coalition [[House of Freedoms]] ({{lang-it|La Casa delle Libertà}}), which included the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]], the [[Lega Nord]], the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and other parties. Berlusconi's success in the [[2001 Italian general election|May 2001 general election]] led to him becoming Prime Minister once more, with the coalition receiving 49.6% of the vote for the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] and 42.5% for the [[Italian Senate|Senate]].

On the television interviews programme ''[[Porta a Porta]]'', during the last days of the electoral campaign, Berlusconi created a powerful impression on the public by undertaking to sign a so-called ''Contratto con gli Italiani'' ({{lang-en|[[Contract with the Italians]]}}), an idea copied outright by his advisor Luigi Crespi from [[Newt Gingrich]]'s [[Contract with America]] introduced six weeks before the 1994 US Congressional election.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gingrich |first1=Newt |author-link1=Newt Gingrich |last2=Armey |first2=Dick |author-link2=Dick Armey |title=Contract With America: The Bold Plan |year=1994|title-link=Contract With America }}</ref> This was considered to be a creative masterstroke in his 2001 bid for prime ministership. Berlusconi committed in this contract to improve several aspects of the Italian economy and life. Firstly, he undertook to simplify the complex tax system by introducing just two income tax rates (33% for those earning over 100,000 euros, and 23% for anyone earning less than that figure: anyone earning less than 11,000 euros a year would not be taxed).  Secondly, he promised to halve the unemployment rate.  Thirdly, he committed to financing and developing a massive new public works programme. Fourthly, he promised to raise the minimum monthly pension rate to 516 euros.  Fifthly, he would reduce crime by introducing police officers to patrol all local zones and areas in Italy's major cities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricolfi |first=Luca |author-link=Luca Ricolfi |title=Dossier Italia: a che punto è il 'contratto con gli italiani |publisher=Il mulino |year=2005}}</ref> Berlusconi promised to not stand for re-election in 2006 if he failed to honour at least four of these five promises.

=== Berlusconi II cabinet ===
[[File:Silvio Berlusconi to a joint session of Congress.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Berlusconi addressing a joint session of the [[U.S. Congress]] in 2006]]
Opposition parties claim Berlusconi was not able to achieve the goals he promised in his ''Contratto con gli Italiani''. Some of his partners in government, especially the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]], admitted the Government fell short of the promises made in the agreement, attributing the failure to an unforeseeable downturn in global economic conditions. Berlusconi himself consistently asserted that he achieved all the goals of the agreement, and said his Government provided ''un miracolo continuo'' (a continuous miracle) that made all 'earlier governments pale' (by comparison). He attributed the widespread failure to recognise these achievements to a campaign of mystification and vilification in the print media, asserting that 85% of newspapers were opposed to him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/e/sezioni/politica/campagna3/goveber/goveber.html |title=Berlusconi: 'Successi straordinari Contro di me l'85% dei giornali', La Repubblica, 24 maggio 2004 |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=24 May 2004 |access-date=17 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022060704/http://www.repubblica.it/2004/e/sezioni/politica/campagna3/goveber/goveber.html |archive-date=22 October 2013}}</ref> Luca Ricolfi, an independent analyst, held that Berlusconi had managed to deliver only one promise out of five, the one concerning minimum pension rates. According to Ricolfi, the other four promises were not honoured, in particular the undertakings on tax simplification and crime reduction.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricolfi |first=Luca |author-link=Luca Ricolfi |title=Tempo scaduto. Il "Contratto con gli italiani" alla prova dei fatti |publisher=Il Mulino |year=2006 |isbn=978-88-15-10888-3}}</ref>

=== Subsequent elections ===
The [[House of Freedoms]] did not do as well in the 2003 local elections as it did in the 2001 national elections. In common with many other European governing groups, in the [[2004 European Parliament election in Italy|2004 elections to the European Parliament]], gaining 43.37% support.{{clarify|date=October 2017}} Forza Italia's support was also reduced from 29.5% to 21.0% (in the 1999 European elections Forza Italia had 25.2%). As an outcome of these results the other coalition parties, whose electoral results were more satisfactory, asked Berlusconi and Forza Italia for greater influence in the government's political line.

=== Berlusconi III cabinet ===
In the 2005 regional elections (3 April/4 April 2005), [[centre-left]] candidates the for regional presidencies won in 12 out of 14 regions where control of local governments and presidencies were at stake. Berlusconi's coalition held only two of the regions ([[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]]) up for re-election. Three parties, [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]], [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and [[New Italian Socialist Party]], threatened to withdraw from the Berlusconi government. Berlusconi after some hesitation, then presented to the [[President of Italy|President of the Republic]] a request for the dissolution of his government on 20 April 2005. On 23 April, he formed a new government with the same allies, reshuffling ministers and amending the government programme. A key point demanded by the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] (and to a lesser extent by [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]) for their continued support was that the strong focus on tax reduction be reduced.

=== Attempt to reform the Italian constitution ===
A key point in the Berlusconi government's programme was a planned reform of the [[Italian Constitution]], which Berlusconi considered to be 'inspired by the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]',<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/berluparla/torino/torino.html |title=Berlusconi: "La Costituzione è di ispirazione sovietica" |language=it |publisher=[[la Repubblica]] |date=12 April 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026002229/http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/berluparla/torino/torino.html |archive-date=26 October 2013}}</ref> an issue on which the coalition parties themselves initially had significantly different opinions. The [[Lega Nord]] insisted on a federalist reform ([[devolution]] of more power to the regions) as a condition for remaining in the coalition. The [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] party pushed for a so-called 'strong premiership' (more powers to the Prime Minister), intended as a counterweight to any federalist reform, in order to preserve the integrity of the nation. The [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] asked for a proportional electoral law that would not damage small parties, and was generally more willing to discuss compromises with the moderate wing of the opposition.

Difficulties in negotiating an agreement caused some internal unrest in the Berlusconi government in 2003, but they were mostly overcome and the law (including devolution of powers to the regions, Federal Senate and "strong premiership") was passed by the Senate in April 2004; it was slightly modified by the Chamber of Deputies in October 2004, and again in October 2005, and finally approved by the Senate on 16 November 2005, with a narrow majority. Approval in a referendum is necessary in order to amend the Italian Constitution without a qualified two-thirds parliamentary majority. The referendum was held on 25–26 July 2006 and resulted in the rejection of the constitutional reform, with 61.3% of voters casting ballots against it.

=== 2006 election and opposition ===
Operating under a new electoral law written unilaterally by the governing parties with strong criticism from the [[parliamentary opposition]], the [[2006 Italian general election|April 2006 general election]] was held. The results of this election handed [[Romano Prodi]]'s centre-left coalition, known as [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]], (Berlusconi's opposition) a very thin majority: 49.8% against 49.7% for the centre-right coalition [[House of Freedoms]] in the [[Lower House]], and a two-senator lead in the Senate (158 senators for The Union and 156 for the House of Freedoms). The [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] subsequently validated the voting procedures and determined that the election process was constitutional.

According to the new electoral rules, The Union, (nicknamed "[[The Soviet Union]]" by Berlusconi<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/politica/cdltre/berlusparla/berlusparla.html |title=Berlusconi sull'Unione "Rimpiangono quella Sovietica" |language=it |publisher=[[la Repubblica]] |date=11 February 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020162753/http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/politica/cdltre/berlusparla/berlusparla.html |archive-date=20 October 2012}}</ref> with a margin of only 25,224 votes (out of over 38&nbsp;million voters), nevertheless won 348 seats (compared to 281 for the House of Freedoms) in the lower house as a result of a [[Majority bonus system|majority premium]] given to whichever coalition of parties was awarded more votes.

This electoral law, approved shortly before the election by Berlusconi's coalition in an attempt to improve their chances of winning the election, led to the coalition's defeat and gave Prodi the chance to form a new cabinet. However, Prodi's [[coalition government|coalition]] consisted of a large number of smaller parties.

In the run-up to the [[2006 Italian general election|2006 general election]], there had been talk among some of the coalition members of the [[House of Freedoms]] about a possible merger into a "united party of moderates and reformers". [[Forza Italia]], the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] party of [[Gianfranco Fini]], and the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] of [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]] all seemed interested in the project. Soon after the election, however, Casini started to distance his party from its historical allies.

On 2 December 2006, during a major demonstration of the centre-right in Rome against the [[Prodi II Cabinet|government led by Romano Prodi]], Berlusconi proposed the foundation of a "''Freedom Party''", arguing that the people and voters of the different political movements aligned to the demonstration were all part of a "''people of freedom''".

On 18 November 2007, after claiming the collection of more than 7&nbsp;million signatures (including that of [[Umberto Bossi]]) demanding that the [[President of Italy|President of the Republic]] [[Giorgio Napolitano]] call a fresh election,<ref>{{cite web |title=FI: 7 Milioni di firme per nuovo governo |url=http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/notizie/rubriche/daassociare/visualizza_new.html_65041167.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120051659/http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/notizie/rubriche/daassociare/visualizza_new.html_65041167.html |language=it |date=18 November 2007 |archive-date=20 November 2007 |publisher=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]}}</ref> Berlusconi announced from the [[running board]] of a car in a crowded Piazza San Babila in [[Milan]]<ref>{{cite web |title="Caste" is 2007's Word of the Year |url=http://www.corriere.it/english/articoli/2008/01_Gennaio/02/casta.shtml |publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]] |date=2 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106044612/http://www.corriere.it/english/articoli/2008/01_Gennaio/02/casta.shtml |archive-date=6 November 2012}}</ref> that Forza Italia would soon merge or transform into [[The People of Freedom]] party, also known as the PdL (Il Popolo della Libertà).<ref>{{cite web |title=Oggi nasce il partito del popolo italiano |url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/07_novembre_18/berlusconi_partito_popolo_italiano.shtml |date=17 November 2007 |language=it |publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201937/http://www.corriere.it/politica/07_novembre_18/berlusconi_partito_popolo_italiano.shtml |archive-date=29 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Berlusconi: Nuovo Partito, Bipolarismo non Possibile |url=http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_65043240.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120051744/http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_65043240.html |language=it |date=19 November 2007 |archive-date=20 November 2007 |publisher=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]}}</ref> Berlusconi also stated that this new political movement could include the participation of other parties.<ref>{{cite news |title=Via l'Ici e stretta sulle intercettazioni |url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_25/berlusconi_napoli_a48218f8-cb73-11dc-9e0e-0003ba99c667.shtml |publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]] |language=it |date=25 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201351/http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_25/berlusconi_napoli_a48218f8-cb73-11dc-9e0e-0003ba99c667.shtml |archive-date=29 October 2013}}</ref> Both supporters and critics of the new party called Berlusconi's announcement "''the [[running board]] [[revolution]]''".<ref>Italian: "la rivoluzione del predellino"</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Il futuro della rivoluzione del predellino |url=http://www.tempi.it/editoriale/002715-il-futuro-della-rivoluzione-del-predellino |publisher=Tempi |language=it |date=3 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225130136/http://www.tempi.it/editoriale/002715-il-futuro-della-rivoluzione-del-predellino |archive-date=25 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=E per la rivoluzione del predellino il Cavaliere lascia giacca e cravatta |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2007/12/16/per-la-rivoluzione-del-predellino-il.html | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120713025112/http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2007/12/16/per-la-rivoluzione-del-predellino-il.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 13 July 2012 |publisher=[[la Repubblica]] |language=it |date=16 December 2007}}</ref>

After the sudden fall of the [[Prodi II Cabinet]] on 24 January, the break-up of [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]] coalition and [[2008 Italian political crisis|the subsequent political crisis]] (which paved the way for a [[2008 Italian general election|fresh general election in April 2008]]), Berlusconi, [[Gianfranco Fini]] and other party leaders finally agreed on 8 February 2008 to form a joint list named ''[[The People of Freedom]]'' ({{lang-it|Il Popolo della Libertà}}), allied with the [[Lega Nord]] of Umberto Bossi and with the Sicilian [[Movement for Autonomy]] of [[Raffaele Lombardo]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/200802articoli/29934girata.asp |title=Svolta di Berlusconi, arriva il Pdl: "Forza Italia-An sotto stesso simbolo" |language=it |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |date=8 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029214056/http://www1.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/200802articoli/29934girata.asp |archive-date=29 October 2013}}</ref>

In the [[2008 Italian general election|snap parliamentary elections held on 13/14 April 2008]], this coalition won against [[Walter Veltroni]]'s centre-left coalition in both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]].

In the 315-member Senate of the Republic, Berlusconi's coalition won 174 seats to Veltroni's 134. In the [[lower house]], Berlusconi's conservative bloc led by a margin of 9% of the vote: 46.5% (344 seats) to 37.5% (246 seats). Berlusconi capitalised on discontent over the nation's stagnating [[Economy of Italy|economy]] and the unpopularity of [[Prodi II Cabinet|Prodi's government]]. His declared top priorities were to remove piles of rubbish from the streets of [[Naples]] and to improve the state of the Italian economy, which had under-performed the rest of the [[Eurozone]] for years. He also said he was open to working with the opposition, and pledged to fight [[tax avoidance]] and [[tax evasion]], reform the judicial system and reduce public debt. He intended to reduce the number of [[Prodi II Cabinet|Cabinet ministers]] to 12. Berlusconi and his ministers ([[Berlusconi IV Cabinet]]) were sworn in on 8 May 2008.

On 21 November 2008, the National Council of [[Forza Italia]], chaired by [[Alfredo Biondi]] and attended by Berlusconi himself, dissolved Forza Italia and established [[The People of Freedom]], whose inauguration took place on 27 March 2009, the 15th anniversary of Berlusconi's first electoral victory.

While Forza Italia had never held a formal party congress to formulate its rules, procedures, and democratic balloting for candidates and issues, (since 1994 three party conventions of Forza Italia have been held, all of them resolving to support Berlusconi and reelecting him by acclamation) on 27 March 2009, at the foundation congress of the [[People of Freedom]] political movement the statute of the new party was subject to a vote of approval. On 5,820 voting delegates, 5,811 voted in favour, 4 against and 5 abstained.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://giornaleonline.unionesarda.ilsole24ore.com/Articolo.aspx?Data=20090330&Categ=1&Voce=2&IdArticolo=2336849 |title=La Russa, Verdini, Bondi: ecco il triumvirato |language=it |publisher=[[L'Unione Sarda]] |date=30 March 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> During that political congress Berlusconi was elected as [[Chairman]] of the [[People of Freedom]] by a show of hands.

[[File:Alte cariche.jpg|thumb|Berlusconi with his historic ally, [[Gianfranco Fini]], and then President of the Republic [[Giorgio Napolitano]] in 2009]]

Between 2009 and 2010, [[Gianfranco Fini]], former leader of the [[National conservatism|national conservative]] National Alliance (AN) and [[List of Presidents of the Italian Chamber of Deputies|President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies]], became a vocal critic of the leadership of Berlusconi. Fini departed from party's majority line on several issues but, most of all, he was a proponent of a more structured party organisation. His criticism was aimed at the leadership style of Berlusconi, who tends to rely on his personal charisma to lead the party from the centre and supports a less structured form of party, a movement-party that organises itself only at election times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/16/premier_consegna_prime_case_Poi_co_8_090916015.shtml |title=Il premier consegna le prime case Poi l' attacco in tv |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=16 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105145607/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/16/premier_consegna_prime_case_Poi_co_8_090916015.shtml |archive-date=5 November 2012}}</ref>

On 15 April 2010, an association named [[Generation Italy]] was launched in order to better represent Fini's views within the party and push for a different form of party organisation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/marzo/15/Via_Generazione_Italia_nuova_associazione_co_9_100315008.shtml |title=Via a Generazione Italia la nuova associazione "benedetta" da Fini |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=15 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105145714/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/marzo/15/Via_Generazione_Italia_nuova_associazione_co_9_100315008.shtml |archive-date=5 November 2012}}</ref> On 22 April 2010 the National Committee of the PdL convened in Rome for the first time in a year.

Berlusconi is among the most vocal supporters of closer ties between Russia and the [[European Union]].

On 5 April 2009, at the EU-US summit in [[Prague]] Berlusconi proposed an eight-point road map to accelerate the Euro-Atlantic integration of the [[western Balkans]]. During that summit the Italian Foreign Minister [[Franco Frattini]] urged his European colleagues to send "visible and concrete" signs to the countries concerned ([[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Bosnia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], and [[Albania]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/esteri/frattini_piano_otto_punti_balcani/05-04-2009/articolo-id=341698-page=0-comments=1 |title=Frattini: piano in otto punti per i Balcani |language=it |publisher=[[il Giornale]] |date=5 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224203945/http://www.ilgiornale.it/esteri/frattini_piano_otto_punti_balcani/05-04-2009/articolo-id%3D341698-page%3D0-comments%3D1 |archive-date=24 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Berlusconism ==
[[Berlusconism]] ({{lang-it|Berlusconismo}}) is a term used in the [[Western world|Western]] media and by a few Italian analysts to describe the political positions of Berlusconi.

=== Origins and features ===
[[File:Silvio Berlusconi and George W. Bush, speaking at Crawford, Texas.jpg|thumb|Berlusconi with President [[George W. Bush]], in Texas, 2005]]

The term "Berlusconismo" arose in the 1980s, with a strongly positive meaning, as a synonym for ''entrepreneurial optimism'', that is, as an entrepreneurial spirit which is not shaken by difficulties, and believes that problems can be solved.<ref>Floriano De Angeli, "L'Europeo", n. 49, 1993</ref> However, in the 21st century, the meaning has changed.

According to the Italian definition given by the online vocabulary of the Encyclopedia Institute, Berlusconismo has a wide range of meanings, all having their origins in the figure of Berlusconi, and the political movement inspired by him: the "thought movement",<ref name=Treccani/> but also to "social phenomenon",<ref name=Treccani/> and, even, the phenomenon "of custom"<ref name=Treccani/> bound to his entrepreneurial and political figure. The term is also used to refer to a certain laissez-faire vision supported by him, not in the economy and markets, but also in relation to politics.<ref name="Treccani">[http://www.treccani.it/Portale/elements/categoriesItems.jsp?pathFile=/sites/default/BancaDati/Vocabolario_online/B/VIT_III_B_013453.xml "berlusconismo"] [[sostantivo|s.]] [[maschile|m.]], [[lemma (linguistica)|lemma]] del ''Vocabolario Treccani online'', dal sito dell'[[Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana Treccani]]</ref>

According to Berlusconi's political and entrepreneurial opponents, ''Berlusconismo'' is only a form of [[demagogic]] [[populism]], comparable to [[Italian fascism|Fascism]], in part because Berlusconi has defended aspects of the regime of [[Benito Mussolini]],<ref name="Owen2008">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3746319.ece |title=Profile: the irrepressible Silvio Berlusconi |work=The Times |location=London |date=14 April 2008 |access-date=16 April 2008 |first=Richard |last=Owen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629120652/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3746319.ece |archive-date=29 June 2011}}</ref> even though he has criticised the [[Manifesto of Race|racial Fascist laws]] and the alliance with [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://972mag.com/strange-relationship-between-silvio-berlusconi-and-italian-jews/65487/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215080840/http://972mag.com/strange-relationship-between-silvio-berlusconi-and-italian-jews/65487/|url-status=dead|title=The strange relationship between Silvio Berlusconi and Italian Jews|date=6 February 2013|archive-date=15 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2006/04/17/lifestyle/pro-israel-berlusconi-loses-in-italy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116223429/http://www.jta.org/2006/04/17/life-religion/features/pro-israel-berlusconi-loses-in-italy|url-status=dead|title=Pro-Israel Berlusconi loses in Italy|date=17 April 2006|archive-date=16 January 2014}}</ref> In 2013, he returned to calling Mussolini a good leader whose biggest mistake was signing up to exterminate the [[Jews]].<ref name="aljazeera.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/01/20131280123580592.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417115744/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/01/20131280123580592.html|url-status=dead|title=Berlusconi defends 'good' Mussolini|archive-date=17 April 2014|website=Aljazeera.com}}</ref> Contrastingly his supporters compare ''Berlusconismo'' to French [[Gaullism]] and Argentinian [[Peronism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.claudioscajola.it/evento.asp?id=392 |title=Il Berlusconismo è come Gollismo: durerà a lungo, non è passeggero |access-date=2 October 2008 |date=25 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109222607/http://www.claudioscajola.it/evento.asp?id=392 |archive-date=9 January 2014}}</ref>

One of Berlusconi's main leadership tactics is to use the party as an apparatus to reach power (defined as a "light party", because of a lack of a complex structure).<ref name="books.google.it"/> This is decidedly comparable to the political tactics used by [[Charles De Gaulle]] in [[France]].

In a piece written for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' and published in April 2017, Lorenzo Newman noted the similarities in the career trajectories between the two men - "Both grew their fortunes on allegedly mafia-linked real-estate developments, transitioned into successful careers as media moguls, and, against all odds, ascended to the helm of their respective national governments" - but also highlighted their shared tendency to question and undermine established institutions such as the judiciary and the press, the way that neither of them had been accepted by their countries' respective establishments despite their wealth, and how they channelled the resulting resentment into a populist form of politics by "portraying themselves as everymen, if not in wealth, then in language, tone (and) aspirations". He also pointed out other commonalities, such as responding to concerns about conflicts of interest by delegating responsibility for running their businesses to family members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2017/04/the_similarities_between_trump_and_berlusconi_are_much_deeper_than_you_think.html |title=Bunga Bunga, American Style |last=Newman |first=Lorenzo |date=3 April 2017 |website=[[slate.com]] |access-date=3 April 2017}}</ref>

[[Andrej Babiš]], the current [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]] has also been compared to Berlusconi due to his media ownership, business activities, political influence and legal problems with a prison sentence hanging over him. An article published by the American magazine [[Foreign Policy]] drew parallels between the two, labelling Babiš with the nickname "Babisconi".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/10/now-the-czechs-have-an-oligarch-problem-too-andrej-babis/|title=Now the Czechs Have an Oligarch Problem, Too|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref>

=== Ongoing trials ===
As of April 2014, after the Unipol case had been completed with Berlusconi being acquitted due to the statute of limitations, Berlusconi is involved in three ongoing court trials.

==== Abuse of office – The Unipol case (2005) ====
In February 2012, Milan prosecutors brought charges against Berlusconi for alleged abuse of office connected with the publication of confidential wiretaps by the Italian newspaper ''Il Giornale'', which is owned by Berlusconi's brother, in 2005.<ref name="FT 07/02/12">{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/33dac7ca-51a8-11e1-a30c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1lz9nZK2s |title=Berlusconi faces another court case |work=The Financial Times |date=7 February 2012 |access-date=10 February 2012 |author=Sanderson, Rachel |location=Milan}}</ref><ref name="BBC 07/02/12">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16933697 |title=Silvio Berlusconi faces fourth trial on wiretap charges |work=BBC News |date=7 February 2012 |access-date=10 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924064832/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16933697 |archive-date=24 September 2013}}</ref> The publication of the conversations between then Governor of the Bank of Italy [[Antonio Fazio]], senior management of [[Unipol]] and Italian centre-left politician [[Piero Fassino]] was a breach of secrecy rules and was seen at the time as an attempt to discredit Berlusconi's political rivals.

==== Bribery of senators supporting the Prodi government (2006) ====
In February 2013, Berlusconi was under investigation for corruption and illegal financing of political parties by the public prosecutor of [[Naples]], in the figures of Vincenzo Piscitelli, [[John Woodcock (magistrate)|Henry John Woodcock]], Francesco Curcio, Alessandro Milita and Fabrizio Vanorio. He is accused of bribing in 2006, with €3&nbsp;million (of which 1&nbsp;million and 2&nbsp;million declared to the tax authorities in black), directed to Senator [[:it:Sergio De Gregorio|Sergio De Gregorio]] (the former leader of the [[Italians in the World]] party) to facilitate its passage into the ranks of the Berlusconi-led coalition [[House of Freedoms]]. Along with Berlusconi, a journalist (Valter Lavitola) at the head of the [[socialist]] newspaper ''[[L'Avanti!]]'' was also investigated, and Sergio De Gregorio self-confessed being the recipient of the bribery.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://napoli.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/02/28/news/berlusconi_indagato_a_napoli_per_compravendita_di_senatori-53565459/?ref=HREA-1 |title=Berlusconi indagato a Napoli per compravendita di senatori |language=it |newspaper=La Repubblica |date=28 February 2013 |access-date=28 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194629/http://napoli.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/02/28/news/berlusconi_indagato_a_napoli_per_compravendita_di_senatori-53565459/?ref=HREA-1 |archive-date=29 October 2013}}</ref>

On 23 October 2013, Berlusconi and Valter Lavitola were both indicted by the judge for preliminary hearings, Amelia Primavera. For Senator De Gregorio the process has already been closed in a preliminary hearing, because he opted to voluntarily confess and [[Plea bargain|bargained]] a reduced sentence of 20 months in prison for the crime. The court hearing at first-instance for the indicted Berlusconi, has been scheduled to start on 11 February 2014.<ref name="Corruption of Prodi senators (ANSA)">{{cite news |title=Compravendita senatori, Berlusconi e Lavitola rinviati a giudizio |language=it |publisher=ANSA |url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/speciali/2013/07/30/Pdl-piazza-Berlusconi-rassicura_9120850.html |access-date=23 October 2013 |date=23 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402205550/http://ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/speciali/2013/07/30/Pdl-piazza-Berlusconi-rassicura_9120850.html |archive-date=2 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="Corruption of Prodi senators (AGI)">{{cite news |title=Compravendita senatori, Berlusconi a processo a Napoli |language=it |publisher=Agenzia Giornalistica Italia (AGI) |url=http://www.agi.it/cronaca/notizie/201310231932-cro-rt10359-compravendita_senatori_berlusconi_a_processo_insorge_pdl |access-date=23 October 2013 |date=23 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030002116/http://www.agi.it/cronaca/notizie/201310231932-cro-rt10359-compravendita_senatori_berlusconi_a_processo_insorge_pdl |archive-date=30 October 2013}}</ref> During the court proceedings, ex-senator [[:it:Paolo Rossi (politico 1958)|Paolo Rossi]] (a former member of [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|The Olive Tree]] party) also testified to have been offered a bribe from Berlusconi by another ex-Senator [[:it:Antonio Tomassini|Antonio Tomassini]] (a former member of the defunct Christian Democrats), to change political sides and join Berlusconi's center-right bloc, so that they together could cause the fall of the Romano Prodi government in 2006–08.

==== Defamation against Antonio Di Pietro (2008) ====
Berlusconi has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the legal degree of the former [[Mani Pulite|Operation "Clean Hands"]] magistrate and leader of the [[Italy of Values]] party, [[Antonio Di Pietro]], when he during a 2008 election rally and in an episode of the talk show Porta a Porta in March 2008 he repeatedly claimed that Di Pietro had not obtained his degree by passing the exams, but with the aid of the secret services, in order to have a judge placed in the system to overturn the parties of the so-called [[History of Italy as a Republic#The First Republic (1947-1992)|First Republic]]. Di Pietro subsequently sued Berlusconi for aggravated [[defamation]] in June 2008. The public prosecutor concluded the preliminary investigation 13 November 2009, by indicting Berlusconi for the defamation offence referred to in Article 595 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. The [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] then intervened in the case by passing a decree 22 September 2010, granting all Italian parliamentarians "absolute immunity" for words spoken while elected.<ref name="Constitutional Court: Case II against Camera">{{cite web |url=http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/schedaConflittoPoteri.do?_conflitto_anno=2013&_conflitto_numero=3 |title=Reg. conf. poteri n.3 del 2013 pubbl. su G.U. del 28/08/2013 n.35 (Appellant: Justice of the Peace of Viterbo, Defendant: Chamber of Deputies) |language=it |publisher=Corte Costituzionale |date=28 August 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Antonio Di Pietro Siena 2010.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Antonio Di Pietro]]]]
On 5 October 2010, the court in [[Viterbo]] ruled that Berlusconi could not be judged or punished, because of the parliamentary immunity enshrined in Article 68 of the Italian constitution forbidding any legal prosecutions against words spoken by parliamentarians in the course of their "exercise of parliamentary duties", in conjunction with the Chamber of Deputies recently having voted for a decree to grant Berlusconi absolute immunity for any spoken words while serving as a deputy. On 19 January 2012, this judgement was set aside by the Supreme Court, which ruled that Berlusconi had been speaking during a campaign rally and not in an institutional setting; meaning he was not covered by the immunity protection provided for by Article 68, and consequently should face a new trial to be held either at the Viterbo court or the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/News/Politica/Cassazione-Berlusconi-accusato-di-diffamazione-a-Di-Pietro-si-riparte-da-zero_312877649022.html |title=Cassazione: Berlusconi accusato di diffamazione a Di Pietro, si riparte da zero |language=it |publisher=Adnkronos |date=19 January 2012 |access-date=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202925/http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/News/Politica/Cassazione-Berlusconi-accusato-di-diffamazione-a-Di-Pietro-si-riparte-da-zero_312877649022.html |archive-date=29 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Cassazione: Berlusconi accusato di diffamazione a Di Pietro, si riparte da zero |url=http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/914198/Cassazione-Berlusconi-accusato-di-diffamazione-a-Di-Pietro-si-riparte-da-zero.html |language=it |publisher=LiberoQuotidiano.it |date=19 January 2012 |access-date=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195416/http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/914198/Cassazione-Berlusconi-accusato-di-diffamazione-a-Di-Pietro-si-riparte-da-zero.html |archive-date=29 October 2013}}</ref>

===Ongoing investigations===
In addition to the ongoing court trials, Berlusconi is currently also involved in the following two ongoing legal investigations, which will evolve to become an ongoing court trial if the judge at the preliminary hearing indict him of the alleged crime:

* '''Ruby [[wikt:ter#Latin|ter]] (2011–13):''' Corruption in judicial acts (bribing witnesses) in connection with evidence submitted at the main "Ruby case". Allegedly a bribery with €2,500 paid per month for each of the 18 Olgettine girls from [[Arcore]] (the girls – including Ruby – participating in the evening events at Berlusconi's residence) to speak in favor of Berlusconi, had been started by his two defending lawyers, [[Niccolò Ghedini]] and [[:it:Piero Longo|Piero Longo]], in the aftermath of the opened police investigation on 15 January 2011. In addition the Mediaset journalist Silvia Trevaini had allegedly been bribed, not only by the same monthly fee but also by extra gifts equal to €800,000. Finally Ruby, in particular, had been promised by Berlusconi "a huge reward if she would keep quiet or otherwise make him mad", and Ruby had replied she was "waiting for €5 million". On 23 January 2014, the public prosecutor Edmondo Bruti Liberati, asked for a legal case to be opened for a preliminary hearing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/14_gennaio_23/ruby-ter-indagato-silvio-berlusconi-l-accusa-corruzione-atti-giudiziari-e27a629e-8415-11e3-a32e-831830ba1aa5.shtml |title="Ruby ter", indagato Berlusconi È accusato di avere corrotto i testimoni |language=it |publisher=Corriere Della Sera |date=23 January 2014}}</ref>
* '''Illegal financing of the political party [[Italians in the World]]:''' On 16 April 2014, the Naples prosecutor deposited new documents in which Berlusconi is under investigation for the crime in recent years of illegal financing of the political party Italians in the World, being led by ex-Senator [[:it:Sergio De Gregorio|Sergio De Gregorio]]. Currently this process is under investigation, with an upcoming preliminary hearing to decide if an court indictment shall be filed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/interni/napoli-pm-chiede-nuove-indagini-su-silvio-berlusconi-1011425.html |title=Napoli, pm chiede nuove indagini su Silvio Berlusconi |language=it |publisher=Il Giornale |date=16 April 2014}}</ref>

=== Cases with final convictions ===
{{As of|October 2013}}, Berlusconi has only been convicted by the final appeal instance in 1 out of [[Trials and allegations involving Silvio Berlusconi|32 court cases]].

==== Tax-fraud conviction in Mediaset trial (1988–98) ====
The [[Mediaset]] trial was launched in April 2005, with indictment of fourteen people (including Berlusconi) for having committed:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/cronaca/processome/processome/processome.html?ref=search |title=Milano, chiusa l'indagine Mediaset.

(A) [[false accounting]] and [[embezzlement]] in order to mask payments of substantial "[[black fund]]s", committed in 1988–94.<br />
(B) [[tax fraud]] equal in total to more than €62&nbsp;million (120bn [[Italian lira|lira]]), committed in 1988–98.

Both indictments were related to achievement of personal [[tax evasion]], through illicit trade of movie rights between Mediaset and secret fictive foreign companies situated in [[tax haven]] nations, causing fictive losses for Mediaset, with the trade gains being accumulated by the foreign companies owned by the indicted tax fraudsters, who ultimately had the gains paid out as personal profit without paying tax in Italy. In 2007, the court case at first-instance had not yet been launched, and the prosecutors dropped the (A) charges against Berlusconi due to the statute of limitations, and for the same reason the (B) charges were narrowed down to the 1994–98 period, in which the prosecutor charged Berlusconi for having committed a personal tax evasion of €7.3&nbsp;million.<ref name="Mediaset trial 1+2">{{cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/giugno/19/anni_mesi_carcere_Berlusconi_co_8_120619045.shtml |title=I pm: 3 anni e 8 mesi di carcere a Berlusconi |language=it |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=19 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101210417/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/giugno/19/anni_mesi_carcere_Berlusconi_co_8_120619045.shtml |archive-date=1 November 2013}}</ref>

The four-year term was longer than the three years and eight months the prosecutors had requested, but was shortened to one year in accord with a 2006 amnesty law intended to reduce [[prison overcrowding]]. Berlusconi and his co-defendants were also ordered to pay a 10&nbsp;million euro fine and were banned from holding public office for three years.<ref name=bbcfraud/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/26/silvio-berlusconi-sentenced-to-four-years-in-prison_n_2023142.html |title=Silvio Berlusconi Sentenced To Four Years In Prison Over Mediaset Tax Evasion |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date=26 October 2012 |access-date=27 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013025003/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/26/silvio-berlusconi-sentenced-to-four-years-in-prison_n_2023142.html |archive-date=13 October 2013}}</ref>

In regards of calculating the exact length of the public office ban, the Court of Cassation asked the lower court to re-judge this, because of prosecutors having presented new legal arguments for the ban to be reduced from five to three years. However, a new anti-corruption law passed in late 2012, referred to as the [[:it:Legge Severino|Severino law]], will bar Berlusconi from seeking elective office for six years, independently of the court's final ruling regarding the length of the public office ban. The ramification of his public office ban is that it makes him ineligible to serve any public office, but technically he will still be allowed as a non-candidate to continue leading his party and centre-right coalition in election campaigns. A similar situation occurred in March 2013, when the leader of the [[Five Star Movement]], [[Beppe Grillo]], convicted over a road accident in 1988, led his party's [[2013 Italian general election|2013 election]] campaign despite not being able to run for public office because of a rule established within his movement.<ref name="CNNappeal">{{cite news |title=Silvio Berlusconi sentence: Is this the end for 'Il Cavaliere'? |first=Alberto |last=Nardelli |date=2 August 2013 |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/02/world/europe/silvio-berlusconi-sentence-analysis/ |access-date=2 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422035216/http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/02/world/europe/silvio-berlusconi-sentence-analysis/ |archive-date=22 April 2014}}</ref>

Berlusconi, due to being over 70 years of age, will not be placed direct in prison, but can instead decide if he wants to serve his one-year jail term either by a [[house arrest]] at one of his private residences or by doing [[community service]]. As the gross prison term exceeds two years, the ''Severino law'' prompts the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Italian senate]] to vote if Berlusconi shall be forced to resign his current senate seat immediately, or alternatively allowing the court imposed ban on holding public office only to take effect by the end of his current legislative term. The pending senate vote, combined with anger over Berlusconi's conviction – a poll indicated 42% of the public believe he has been unfairly persecuted by the magistrates – present a serious political challenge for the fragile ruling coalition.<ref name=CNNappeal/> On 3 August, Berlusconi suggested that unless a "solution" to his predicament could be found, Italy was at "risk of a civil war".<ref name="protestors">{{cite news |title=Protesters rally in Rome against ruling on Berlusconi |first=Paddy |last=Agnew |work=Irish Times |date=5 August 2013 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/protesters-rally-in-rome-against-ruling-on-berlusconi-1.1484565 |access-date=5 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215837/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/protesters-rally-in-rome-against-ruling-on-berlusconi-1.1484565 |archive-date=4 October 2013}}</ref> The following day, thousands of supporters gathered in front of his house in protest of the ruling.<ref name=protestors/>

The deliberations of the Senate committee are expected to last for several weeks, before they reach a decision. According to the ''Severino law'', which became enacted by the Monti government in December 2012, anyone sentenced to more than two years in prison is deemed ineligible to hold public office for a period of six years (or eight years if convicted for "abuse of power"), and should immediately be expelled from the parliament. Berlusconi has argued that the ''Severino law'' can not be used to expel persons convicted for crimes committed before December 2012, and pleaded for the proceedings to be postponed until the [[European Court of Human Rights]] or [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italy's constitutional court]] had ruled, whether or not he was correct about his interpretation of the law. Berlusconi also stated that he in any case had decided to appeal the court ruling against him to the European Court of Human Rights, as he still claimed the ruling itself to be a political and unjust attempt by his opponents, to deprive him of his political power. The response by Prime Minister [[Enrico Letta]]'s centre-left Democratic Party was however to reject Berlusconi's plea, accusing him of only launching time-wasting maneuvers.<ref name="Severino law request a legislative office ban for 6 years">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24015130 |title=Italian senators debate Berlusconi expulsion |work=BBC News |date=9 September 2013 |access-date=10 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418201323/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24015130 |archive-date=18 April 2014}}</ref> Berlusconi's PDL party then made a threat to withdraw their support for the government if the Senate committee expelled Berlusconi as senator. The Democratic Party replied by warning the PDL that they would reject any blackmail attempts, and in any case only would vote in the Senate committee according to the standard of the Italian law.

On 10 September, at the second day of the Senate deliberations, the Democratic Party stated they intended to vote down all three PDL submitted motions to delay the Senate deliberations, and accused PDL of obstructing the work of the Senate committee by playing delaying tactics. [[Renato Brunetta]], floor leader of the PDL in the lower house, responded by saying "If the Democratic Party and Grillo's people decide this evening to vote against the proposals, the Democratic Party will bring down the Letta government".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/10/us-italy-berlusconi-idUSBRE9890QJ20130910 |title=Berlusconi allies step up threats over Italian Senate ruling |work=Reuters |date=10 September 2013 |access-date=10 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055833/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/10/us-italy-berlusconi-idUSBRE9890QJ20130910 |archive-date=21 September 2013}}</ref> The meeting at the second day ended with PDL agreeing to drop their series of technical objections to try to halt the hearings, on the agreement that each of the committee members could speak at greater length in a broad discussion on the merits of the case.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/10/us-italy-berlusconi-idUSBRE9891H820130910 |title=Italian lawmakers delay showdown over Berlusconi |work=Reuters |date=10 September 2013 |access-date=10 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055315/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/10/us-italy-berlusconi-idUSBRE9891H820130910 |archive-date=21 September 2013}}</ref> On 18 September, Berlusconi made a national televised speech, in which he pledged to stay as party leader of a [[Forza Italia (2013)|revived Forza Italia]], no matter if the Senate would end up deciding to expel him or not.<ref name="Berlusconi pledged a continued Forza Italia leadership"/> On 25 September, the PDL parliamentary group agreed on a resolution to threaten the Senate, that if Berlusconi would be expelled, then all PDL parliamentarians would immediately "reflect on and decide according to his or her conscience", whether or not to show sympathy with Berlusconi by resigning their own seats in the Senate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/berlusconis-mps-threaten-mass-walkout-20130926-2ufyg.html#ixzz2fzF81oorfor |title=Berlusconi's MPs threaten mass walk-out |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 September 2013 |access-date=26 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104427/http://www.smh.com.au/world/berlusconis-mps-threaten-mass-walkout-20130926-2ufyg.html |archive-date=28 December 2013}}</ref> The Senate Committee nevertheless voted 15:8 in support for a recommendation to expel Berlusconi on 4 October,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/italy-senate-committee-votes-in-favor-of-ousting-berlusconi-1380899168 |title=Italy Senate Committee Votes in Favor of Ousting Berlusconi |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=4 October 2013 |access-date=4 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012191402/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304176904579115243180602098.html |archive-date=12 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="Senate Committee vote 15:8">{{cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/full-italian-senate-vote-looms-on-berlusconi-expulsion/1763441.html |title=Full Italian Senate Vote Looms on Berlusconi Expulsion |publisher=Voice of America |date=4 October 2013 |access-date=4 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015061740/http://www.voanews.com/content/full-italian-senate-vote-looms-on-berlusconi-expulsion/1763441.html |archive-date=15 October 2013}}</ref> and ten days later submitted a final report about the case, so that it can be scheduled for a final vote in the full Senate by early November.<ref name="Senate Vote postponed (Republicca)">{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2013/10/15/news/giunta_regolamento_senato_voto_berlusconi-68621027/ |title=Forfeiture Berlusconi.

Berlusconi's extensive control over the media has been widely criticised by some analysts,<ref>{{cite book |last=Hine |first=David |author-link=David Hine |title=Silvio Berlusconi, i media e il conflitto di interesse |publisher=Il Mulino |year=2002 |pages=291–307 }}</ref> some press freedom organisations, and extensively by several Italian newspapers, national and private TV channels, by opposition leaders and in general members of opposition parties, who allege that Italy's media has [[Freedom of the press in Italy|limited freedom of expression]]. However such coverage of the complaint in practice put under discussion the point of the complaint itself.

Berlusconi owns via [[Mediaset]] 3 of 7 national TV channels: ([[Canale 5]], [[Italia 1]], and [[Rete 4]]).  In 2002, [[Luciano Violante]], a prominent member of the Left, said in a speech in [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Parliament]]: "Honourable Anedda, I invite you to ask the honourable Berlusconi, because he certainly knows that he received a full guarantee in 1994, when the government changed—that TV stations would not be touched.

Peter Gomez and Marco Travaglio, 2005, [[RCS MediaGroup]], {{ISBN|978-88-17-01020-7}}</ref> cite this sentence as evidence for the idea that the Left made a deal with Berlusconi in 1994, in which a promise was made not to honour a law in the [[Constitutional Court of Italy]] that would have required Berlusconi to give up one of his three TV channels in order to uphold pluralism and competition. According to the authors, this would be an explanation of why the Left, despite having won the 1996 elections, did not pass a law to solve the conflicts of interest between media ownership and politics.

Berlusconi's influence over RAI became evident when in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]] he expressed his views on journalists [[Enzo Biagi]] and [[Michele Santoro]],<ref name="Ref_2002c">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=3284 |title=Media pluralism more threatened than ever |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |date=6 August 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222094910/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=3284 |archive-date=22 February 2008}}</ref> and comedian [[Daniele Luttazzi]].

=== ''The Economist'' ===
One of Berlusconi's strongest critics in the media outside Italy is the British weekly ''[[The Economist]]'' (nicknamed ''"The Ecommunist"'' by Berlusconi, despite the magazine's association with [[market liberalism]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2020/07/italy-populist-right-berlusconi-salvini |title=The Rise of Italy's Populist Right Is a Bleak Warning From the Recent Past |last=Broder |first=David |date=17 July 2020 |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)]] |access-date=18 July 2020}}</ref> which in its issue of 26 April 2001 carried a title on its front cover, 'Why Silvio Berlusconi is unfit to lead Italy'.<ref>{{cite book

Berlusconi claimed the article contained "a series of old accusations" that was an "insult to truth and intelligence".

According to ''The Economist''{{'s}} findings, Berlusconi, while Prime Minister of Italy, retained in effective control of 90% of all national television broadcasting. This figure included stations he owns directly as well as those over which he had indirect control by dint of his position as Prime Minister and his ability to influence the choice of the management bodies of these stations. ''The Economist'' has also claimed that the Italian Prime Minister is corrupt and self-serving. A key journalist for ''The Economist'', David Lane, has set out many of these charges in his book ''Berlusconi's Shadow''.<ref name="shadow">{{cite book

Lane points out that Berlusconi has not defended himself in court against the main charges, but has relied upon political and legal manipulations, most notably by changing the statute of limitation to prevent charges being completed in the first place. In order to publicly prove the truth of the documented accusations contained in their articles, the newspaper has publicly challenged Berlusconi to sue ''The Economist'' for libel. Berlusconi did so,<ref name="Ref_k">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/20080905122118632.pdf |title=Document from the Milan court of justice |access-date=2 March 2010 |work=The Economist |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020005213/http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/20080905122118632.pdf |archive-date=20 October 2013}}</ref> losing versus ''The Economist'', and being charged for all the trial costs on 5 September 2008, when the Court in Milan issued a judgment rejecting all Mr Berlusconi's claims and sentenced him to compensate for ''The Economist'''s legal expenses.

=== Legislative changes ===

On some occasions, laws passed by the Berlusconi administration have effectively delayed ongoing trials involving him. For example, the law reducing punishment for all cases of false accounting and the law on ''legitimate suspicion'', which allowed defendants to request their cases to be moved to another court if they believe that the local judges are biased against them. Because of these legislative actions, political opponents accuse Berlusconi of passing these laws for the purpose of protecting himself from legal charges.  ''La Repubblica'', for example, sustained that Berlusconi passed 17 different laws which have advantaged himself.<ref name="Ref_2009f">{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/11/sezioni/politica/giustizia-18/inchiesta-davanzo/inchiesta-davanzo.html |title=Per Silvio Berlusconi 18 salvacondotti in 15 anni |language=it |work=la Repubblica |date=23 November 2009 |access-date=2 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110112032/http://www.repubblica.it/2009/11/sezioni/politica/giustizia-18/inchiesta-davanzo/inchiesta-davanzo.html |archive-date=10 November 2013}}</ref> Berlusconi and his allies, on the other hand, maintain that such laws are consistent with everyone's right to a rapid and just trial, and with the principle of "presumption of innocence" (''garantismo''); furthermore, they claim that Berlusconi is being subjected to a political "witch hunt", orchestrated by certain (allegedly left-wing) judges.

Berlusconi and his government quarrelled with the Italian judiciary often. His administration attempted to pass a judicial reform intended to limit the flexibility of judges and magistrates in their decision-making.  Critics said it would instead limit the magistracy's independence by ''de facto'' subjecting the judiciary to the executive's control. The reform was met by almost unanimous dissent from the Italian judges, but was passed by the Italian parliament in December 2004.  It was vetoed by the Italian President, [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]].

During the night hours between 5 and 6 March 2010, the Berlusconi-led Italian government passed a decree "interpreting" the electoral law to let the PDL candidate run for governor in Lazio after she had failed to properly register for the elections. The Italian Constitution states that electoral procedures can only be changed in Parliament, and must not be changed by governmental decree. Italy's president, whose endorsement of the decree was required by law, said that the measure taken by the government may not violate the Constitution.<ref name="Ref_2010b">{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Italy_opposition_protest_for_second_day_over_decree.html?cid=8432170 |title=Italy opposition protest for second day over decree |date=7 March 2010 |work=[[swissinfo]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511210247/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Italy_opposition_protest_for_second_day_over_decree.html?cid=8432170 |archive-date=11 May 2011}}</ref><ref name="Ref_2010c">{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Italy_opposition_protests_at_ballot_decree.html?cid=8428120 |title=Italy opposition protests at ballot decree |date=6 March 2010 |work=[[swissinfo]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511210254/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Italy_opposition_protests_at_ballot_decree.html?cid=8428120 |archive-date=11 May 2011}}</ref>

Berlusconi has never been tried on charges relating to the ''[[Sicilian Mafia|Cosa Nostra]]'', although several Mafia turncoats have stated that Berlusconi had connections with the Sicilian criminal association. The claims arise mostly from the hiring of [[Vittorio Mangano]], who was accused of being a ''mafioso'', as a gardener and stable-man at Berlusconi's Villa San Martino in [[Arcore]], a small town near Milan. It was Berlusconi's friend [[Marcello Dell'Utri]] who introduced Mangano to Berlusconi in 1973.<ref name="eco260401">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=587107 |title=An Italian Story |work=The Economist |date=28 April 2001}}, The Economist, 26 April 2001</ref><ref name="bbc080103">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2638609.stm |title=Berlusconi accused of Mafia links |work=BBC News |date=8 January 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150859/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2638609.stm |archive-date=13 April 2014}}, BBC News, 8 January 2003</ref> Berlusconi denied any ties to the Mafia.

In 1996, a Mafia informer, [[Salvatore Cancemi]], declared that Berlusconi and Dell'Utri were in direct contact with [[Salvatore Riina]], head of the [[Sicilian Mafia]] in the 1980s and 1990s. Cancemi disclosed that Fininvest, through Marcello Dell'Utri and mafioso [[Vittorio Mangano]], had paid Cosa Nostra 200&nbsp;million lire (between 100,000 and 200,000 of today's euro) annually. The alleged contacts, according to Cancemi, were to lead to legislation favourable to Cosa Nostra, in particular reforming the harsh [[Article 41-bis prison regime|41-bis prison regime]]. The underlying premise was that Cosa Nostra would support Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in return for political favours.<ref name="gua100501">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4183973,00.html |title=Berlusconi friend on trial for 'aiding Mafia' |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Philip |last=Willan |date=10 May 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003022950/http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0%2C4273%2C4183973%2C00.html |archive-date=3 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}, ''The Guardian'', 10 May 2001</ref> After a two-year investigation, magistrates closed the inquiry without charges.

According to yet another Mafia turncoat, [[Antonino Giuffrè]]&nbsp;– arrested on 16 April 2002&nbsp;– the Mafia turned to Berlusconi's [[Forza Italia]] party to look after the Mafia's interests, after the decline in the early 1990s of the ruling [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democratic]] party, whose leaders in Sicily looked after the Mafia's interests in Rome. The Mafia's fall out with the Christian Democrats became clear when [[Salvo Lima]] was killed in March 1992. "The Lima murder marked the end of an era," Giuffrè told the court. "A new era opened with a new political force on the horizon which provided the guarantees that the Christian Democrats were no longer able to deliver. To be clear, that party was Forza Italia."<ref name="gua080103">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/08/italy.philipwillan |title=Berlusconi aide 'struck deal with mafia' |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=8 January 2003 |first=Philip |last=Willan |access-date=30 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706165131/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jan/08/italy.philipwillan |archive-date=6 July 2013}}</ref> Dell'Utri was the go-between on a range of legislative efforts to ease pressure on mafiosi in exchange for electoral support, according to Giuffrè.

Giuffrè also said that Berlusconi himself used to be in touch with [[Stefano Bontade]], a top Mafia boss, in the mid-1970s. At the time Berlusconi still was just a wealthy real estate developer and started his private television empire. Bontade visited Berlusconi's villa in [[Arcore]] through his contact [[Vittorio Mangano]].<ref name="guardian05122002"/> Berlusconi's lawyer dismissed Giuffrè's testimony as "false" and an attempt to discredit the Prime Minister and his party.

Dell'Utri's lawyer, Enrico Trantino, dismissed Giuffrè's allegations as an "anthology of hearsay".

In October 2009, [[Gaspare Spatuzza]], a Mafioso turncoat in 2008, has confirmed Giuffrè statements. Spatuzza testified that his boss Giuseppe Graviano had told him in 1994, that Berlusconi was bargaining with the Mafia, concerning a political-electoral agreement between Cosa Nostra and Berlusconi's Forza Italia.

===Right-to-die case===
After the family of [[Eluana Englaro]] (who had been comatose for 17 years) succeeded in having her [[right to die]] recognized by the judges and getting doctors to start the process of allowing her to die in the way established by the court, Berlusconi issued a decree to stop the doctor from letting her die.

=== Anti-immigration laws ===
[[File:36th G8 summit member cropped 36th G8 summit member 20100625 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Berlusconi with other [[G8]] leaders in 2010, Canada]]
During his long career as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]], Berlusconi has had to deal with [[Immigration to Italy|massive immigration]] from the coast of [[North Africa]]. To limit [[illegal immigration]], the [[Berlusconi II Cabinet|Berlusconi's government]] promulgated the ''Bossi-Fini law'' in 2002. This law took the name by the leaders of the two [[right-wing]] allied parties in Berlusconi's government coalition, [[Umberto Bossi]] of [[Lega Nord]] and [[Gianfranco Fini]] of [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]].<ref>http://www.amnesty.it/pressroom/ra2006/italia.html?page=ra2006  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213051108/http://www.amnesty.it/pressroom/ra2006/italia.html?page=ra2006 |date=13 February 2007 }}</ref>

The law provides the expulsion, issued by the Prefect of the Province where an illegal foreign immigrant is found, and is immediately performed with the assistance at the border of the [[Italian police|police]]. Illegal immigrants without valid identity documents, are taken to [[Immigration detention|detention centers]], set up by the ''Turco-Napolitano law'', in order to be identified. The law provides for the issuance of residence permits to persons who provide proof of having a job for their maintenance budget. To this general rule you add the special residence permits and those in the application of the [[right to asylum]].

The standard allows the repatriation to the country of origin on the high seas, on the basis of bilateral agreements between [[Italy]] and neighboring countries, which commit the police forces of their respective countries to cooperate in the prevention of [[illegal immigration]]. If the illegal immigrant ships dock on Italian soil, the identification of those entitled to [[political asylum]] and the supply of medical treatment and care is undertaken by the marine police force. The law had been severely criticised by the [[centre-left]] opposition.

In 2013, the [[European Parliament]] asked [[Italy]] to modify the ''Bossi-Fini law'' because it was too restrictive and severe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2013/10/23/immigrazione-parlamento-ue-modificare-norme-che-infliggono-sanzioni-a-chi-aiuta/754022/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026020208/http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2013/10/23/immigrazione-parlamento-ue-modificare-norme-che-infliggono-sanzioni-a-chi-aiuta/754022/|url-status=dead|title=Immigrazione, Parlamento Ue chiede la modifica della legge Bossi-Fini|date=23 October 2013|archive-date=26 October 2013|website=Il Fatto Quotidiano}}</ref>

On 2 July 2003, Berlusconi suggested that German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social democratic]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Martin Schulz]], who had criticised his domestic policies, should play a [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] [[Kapo (Arbeitslager)|guard]] in a film.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3037386.stm |title=Berlusconi in EU 'Nazi' slur |work=BBC News |date=2 July 2003 |access-date=1 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611004851/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3037386.stm |archive-date=11 June 2009}}</ref> Berlusconi insisted that he was joking, but accused Schulz and others to be "bad-willing tourists of democracy".

Addressing traders at the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in September 2003, Berlusconi listed a series of reasons to invest in Italy, the first of which was that "we have the most beautiful secretaries in the world". This remark resulted in remonstration among female members of parliament, who took part in a one-day cross-party protest.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3137406.stm |title=Berlusconi vaunts Italy's secretaries |work=BBC News |date=24 September 2003 |access-date=2 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415214307/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3137406.stm |archive-date=15 April 2008}}</ref> Berlusconi's list also included the claim that Italy had "fewer communists, and those who are still here deny having been one".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/5106644/Silvio-Berlusconis-top-10-gaffes-and-pranks.html |title=Silvio Berlusconi's top 10 gaffes and pranks |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=4 April 2009 |access-date=2 September 2011 |first=Nick |last=Squires |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027133405/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/5106644/Silvio-Berlusconis-top-10-gaffes-and-pranks.html |archive-date=27 October 2013}}</ref>

In 2003, during an interview with Nicholas Farrell, then editor of ''[[The Spectator]]'', Berlusconi claimed that [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] "had been a benign dictator who did not murder opponents but sent them 'on holiday{{'"}}.<ref name="Owen2008" /> In 2013, he returned to calling Mussolini a good leader whose biggest mistake was signing up to exterminate the Jews.<ref name="aljazeera.com"/>

Berlusconi had made disparaging remarks about [[Finnish cuisine]] during negotiations to decide on the location of the [[European Food Safety Authority]] in 2001. He caused further offence in 2005, when he claimed that during the negotiations he had had to "dust off his playboy charms" in order to persuade the Finnish president, [[Tarja Halonen]], to concede that the EFSA should be based in [[Parma]] instead of Finland, and compared Finnish smoked [[reindeer]] unfavourably to [[culatello]].

On 24 January 2009, Berlusconi announced his aim to increase the numbers of military patrolling the Italian cities from 3,000 to 30,000 in order to crack down on what he called an "evil army" of criminals. Responding to a female journalist who asked him if this tenfold increase in patrolling soldiers would be enough to secure Italian women from being raped, he said: "We could not field a big enough force to avoid this risk [of rape]. We would need as many soldiers as beautiful women and I don't think that would be possible, because our women are so beautiful." Opposition leaders called the remarks insensitive and in bad taste. Berlusconi retorted that he had merely wanted to compliment Italian women.

In October 2010, Berlusconi was chastised by the Vatican newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' after he was filmed telling "offensive and deplorable jokes", including one whose punchline was similar to one of the gravest blasphemies in the Italian language.

On 27 January 2013, on the occasion of the [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day|Holocaust Remembrance Day]], Berlusconi said the Italian [[fascist]] dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], except for [[Italian racial laws|passing anti-Jewish laws in 1938]], only had done "good things" for Italy; and also said Mussolini from a strategic point of view did the right thing in siding with [[Adolf Hitler]] during [[World War II]], because Hitler at the point of time when the alliance was made had appeared to be winning the war.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/27/us-italy-berlusconi-mussolini-idUSBRE90Q0B620130127 |title=Berlusconi defends Mussolini, draws outrage from political left |work=Reuters |date=27 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229170117/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/27/us-italy-berlusconi-mussolini-idUSBRE90Q0B620130127 |archive-date=29 December 2013}}</ref>

=== Friendship with Bettino Craxi ===
Berlusconi's career as an entrepreneur is also often questioned by his detractors. The allegations made against him generally include suspicions about the extremely rapid increase of his activity in the construction industry in the years 1961–63, hinting at the possibility that in those years he received money from unknown and possibly illegal sources. These accusations are regarded by Berlusconi and his supporters as empty [[slander]], trying to undermine Berlusconi's reputation as a [[self-made man]]. Also frequently cited by opponents are events dating to the 1980s, including supposed "[[Quid pro quo|exchanges of favours]]" between Berlusconi and [[Bettino Craxi]], the former Socialist prime minister and leader of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] convicted in 1994, for various corruption charges. The Milan magistrates who indicted and successfully convicted Mr. Craxi in their "[[Mani pulite|Clean Hands]]" investigation laid bare an entrenched system in which businessmen paid hundreds of millions of dollars to political parties or individual politicians in exchange for sweetheart deals with Italian state companies and the government itself.<ref name="Friedman2000">{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/20/news/20iht-obit.2.t_32.html?scp=2&sq=craxi&st=cse |title=Bettino Craxi, Italian Socialist Leader, Dies in Tunisiader |date=20 January 2000 |access-date=11 November 2009 |first=Alan |last=Friedman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013521/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/20/news/20iht-obit.2.t_32.html?scp=2&sq=craxi&st=cse |archive-date=5 October 2013}}</ref> Berlusconi acknowledges a personal friendship with Craxi.

=== Freedom Army ===
On 28 May 2013, Berlusconi and his entourage launched an online initiative which consisted in the recruitment of volunteers, who are available to defend Berlusconi from the convictions of [[Milan]]'s prosecutors, who are dealing with his trials,<ref>[http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2013/05/28/foto/esercito_silvio_berlusconi-59831988/1/#1 Foto Contro la persecuzione dei magistrati, arriva "l'esercito di Silvio" per difendere il Cavaliere].

Simone Furlan, the creator of the Freedom Army said in an interview: "There comes a time in life, when you realize that fighting for an ideal is no longer a choice but an obligation. We civil society we were helpless spectators of the "War of the Twenty Years" which saw Berlusconi fight and defend against slanderous accusations of all kinds, the result of a judicial persecution without precedent in history".<ref>[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2013-05-28/nasce-esercito-silvio-sito-145922.shtml Nasce l'esercito di Silvio, sito per arruolare "difensori" di Berlusconi dai giudici].

=== Wiretaps and accusations of corruption ===
In December 2007, the audio recording of a phone call between Berlusconi, then leader of the opposition, and Agostino Saccà (general director of [[RAI]]) were published by the magazine ''[[L'espresso]]'' and caused a scandal in the media.<ref name="Ref_2007">{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/12/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-indagato/berlusconi-regime/berlusconi-regime.html |title=Inchiesta Berlusconi "Saccà va sospeso" L'ex premier: "Solleva il morale del Capo" |language=it |work=la Repubblica |date=13 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005713/http://www.repubblica.it/2007/12/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-indagato/berlusconi-regime/berlusconi-regime.html |archive-date=5 October 2013}}</ref>

The wiretap was part of an investigation by the Public Prosecutor Office of [[Naples]], where Berlusconi was investigated for corruption.<ref name="Ref_2007a">{{cite web |url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/07_dicembre_12/berlusconi_indagato_corruzione_sacca_a47dd26e-a884-11dc-8e86-0003ba99c53b.shtml |title=Berlusconi indagato per corruzione |language=it |work=Corriere della Sera |date=12 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004234350/http://www.corriere.it/cronache/07_dicembre_12/berlusconi_indagato_corruzione_sacca_a47dd26e-a884-11dc-8e86-0003ba99c53b.shtml |archive-date=4 October 2013}}</ref>

In the phone call, Saccà expresses words of impassioned political support to Berlusconi and criticises the behaviour of Berlusconi's allies. Berlusconi urges Saccà to broadcast a telefilm series which was strongly advocated by his ally Umberto Bossi. Saccà laments that many people have spread rumours on this agreement causing problems to him. Then Berlusconi asks Saccà to find a job in RAI for a young woman explicitly telling him that this woman would serve as an asset in a secret exchange with a senator of the majority who would help him to cause Prodi, with his administration, to fall.<ref name="Ref_2007b">{{cite web |url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio/Pronto-Silvio-sono-Sacca/1917587 |title=Pronto Silvio, sono Saccà |language=it |work=L'espresso |location=Italy |date=20 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622044420/http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio/pronto-silvio-sono-sacca/1917587 |archive-date=22 June 2013}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} After the publication of these wiretaps, Berlusconi has been accused by other politicians and by some journalists of political corruption through the exploitation of prostitution.

At the end of April 2009, Berlusconi's wife [[Veronica Lario]], who would divorce him several years later, wrote an [[open letter]] expressing her anger at Berlusconi's choice of young, attractive female candidates—some with little or no political experience—to represent the party in the [[2009 European Parliament election in Italy|2009 European Parliament elections]].

[[File:Silvio Berlusconi Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Berlusconi in 2010]]
In November 2010, 17-year old Moroccan [[belly dance]]r and alleged prostitute Karima El Mahroug (better known as "Ruby Rubacuori") claimed to have been given $10,000 by Berlusconi at parties at his private villas. The girl told prosecutors in Milan that these events were like orgies where Berlusconi and 20 young women performed an African-style ritual known as the "[[bunga bunga]]" in the nude.<ref name="Ref_2010d">{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/09/3061762.htm?section=justin |title=Exile an option for besieged Berlusconi |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]] |date=9 November 2010 |access-date=9 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628230203/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/09/3061762.htm?section=justin |archive-date=28 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="Ref_q">[http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-07/silvio-berlusconis-bunga-bunga-parties/ "Berlusconi's 'Bunga Bunga Orgies{{'"}}], ''Daily Beast'' 7 November 2010 Retrieved 25 November 2010 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310055404/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-07/silvio-berlusconis-bunga-bunga-parties |date=10 March 2011 }}</ref>

It was also found out that, on 27 May 2010, El Mahroug had been arrested for theft by the Milan police but (being still a minor) she was directed to a shelter for juvenile offenders. After a couple of hours, while she was being questioned, Berlusconi, who was at the time in Paris, called the head of the police in Milan and pressured for her release, claiming the girl was related to [[Hosni Mubarak]], then [[President of Egypt]], and that in order to avoid a diplomatic crisis, she was to be brought to the custody of Nicole Minetti.  Following repeated telephone calls by Berlusconi to the police authorities, El Mahroug was eventually released and entrusted to Minetti's care.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2011/01/26/visualizza_new.html_1616141984.html |title=Prosecutors send fresh evidence for Ruby case searches: Lombardy councillor at centre of scandal summoned |publisher=ANSA |date=26 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201205109/http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2011/01/26/visualizza_new.html_1616141984.html |archive-date=1 February 2014}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that according to a series of media reports in October 2010, Berlusconi had met El Mahroug, then 17, through Nicole Minetti. Mahroug insisted that she had not slept with the then 74-year-old prime minister. She told Italian newspapers that she merely attended dinner at his mansion near Milan. El Mahroug said she sat next to Berlusconi, who later took her upstairs and gave her an envelope containing €7,000. She said he also gave her jewellery.<ref name="guardian0114"/>

Berlusconi came under fire for reportedly spending $1.8&nbsp;million in state funds from [[RAI|RAI Cinema]] to further the career of a largely unknown Bulgarian actress, Michelle Bonev. The fact that this coincided with severe cuts being made to the country's arts budget provoked a strong reaction from the public.<ref name="Ref_s">[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/36570/berlusconi-in-hot-water-again-for-using-state-funds-to-help-actress/ Berlusconi in Hot Water Again for Using State Funds to Help Actress], ARTINFO.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823130425/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/36570/berlusconi-in-hot-water-again-for-using-state-funds-to-help-actress/ |date=23 August 2011 }}</ref>
