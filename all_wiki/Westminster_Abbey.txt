'''Westminster Abbey''', formally titled the '''Collegiate Church of Saint Peter at Westminster''', is a large, mainly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[abbey church]] in the [[City of Westminster]], London, England, just to the west of the [[Palace of Westminster]]. It is one of the United Kingdom's most notable religious buildings and the traditional place of [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] and burial site for [[List of monarchs of England|English]] and, later, [[List of British monarchs|British]] monarchs. The building itself was a [[Benedictine monasteries|Benedictine monastic church]] until the monastery was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] in 1539. Between 1540 and 1556, the abbey had the status of a [[cathedral]]. Since 1560, the building is no longer an [[abbey]] or a cathedral, having instead the status of a [[Church of England]] "[[Royal Peculiar]]"—a church responsible directly to the [[sovereign]].

According to a tradition first reported by [[Sulcard]] in about 1080, a church was founded at the site (then known as [[Thorney Island (Westminster)|Thorn Ey (Thorn Island)]]) in the seventh century, at the time of [[Mellitus]], a Bishop of London. Construction of the present church began in 1245, on the orders of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].<ref name="History"/>

Since the coronation of [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066, all coronations of English and British monarchs have been in Westminster Abbey.<ref name="History">{{Cite web |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history |title=History |publisher=Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703161201/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history |archive-date=3 July 2014 |access-date=19 April 2008}}</ref><ref name="Coronations">{{Cite web |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/coronations |title=Coronations |publisher=Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222319/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/coronations |archive-date=14 July 2014 |access-date=19 April 2008 }}[http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/coronations Westminster-abbey.org] </ref> There have been [[Westminster Abbey#Royal weddings|16 royal weddings]] at the abbey since 1100.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/weddings |title=Royal Weddings at Westminster Abbey |publisher=Westminster Abbey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714203302/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/weddings |archive-date=14 July 2014 |access-date=29 April 2011}}</ref> As the burial site of more than 3,300 persons, usually of prominence in British history (including at least sixteen monarchs, eight [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers]], poets laureate, actors, scientists, military leaders, and [[the Unknown Warrior]]), Westminster Abbey is sometimes described as 'Britain's [[Valhalla]]', after the iconic hall of the chosen heroes in [[Norse mythology]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Castle |first1=Stephen |title=Stephen Hawking Enters 'Britain's Valhalla,’ Where Space Is Tight |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/world/europe/uk-stephen-hawking-westminster-abbey.html |accessdate=1 January 2019 |agency=New York Times |date=15 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102094722/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/world/europe/uk-stephen-hawking-westminster-abbey.html |archive-date=2 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
A late tradition claims that Aldrich, a young fisherman on the [[River Thames]], had a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of [[Saint Peter]] near the site. This seems to have been quoted as the origin of the salmon that Thames fishermen offered to the abbey in later years – a custom still observed annually by the [[Worshipful Company of Fishmongers|Fishmongers' Company]]. The recorded origins of the Abbey date to the 960s or early 970s, when [[Saint Dunstan]] and [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] installed a community of [[Benedictine]] [[monk]]s on the site.<ref name=wpage>{{cite web|title='Benedictine monks: St Peter's abbey, Westminster', in A History of the County of London: Volume 1, London Within the Bars, Westminster and Southwark,|first=William|last=Page|location=London|year=1909|pages=433–457|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/london/vol1/pp433-457|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729013141/https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/london/vol1/pp433-457|archive-date=29 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===1042: Edward the Confessor starts rebuilding St Peter's Abbey===
[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene26.jpg|thumb|left|St Peter's Abbey at the time of Edward's funeral, depicted in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]
Between 1042 and 1052, King [[Edward the Confessor]] began rebuilding St Peter's Abbey to provide himself with a royal burial church. It was the first church in England built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. The building was completed around 1060 and was consecrated on 28 December 1065, only a week before Edward's death on 5 January 1066.<ref>Eric Fernie, in Mortimer ed., ''Edward the Confessor'', pp. 139–143</ref> A week later, he was buried in the church; and, nine years later, his wife [[Edith of Wessex|Edith]] was buried alongside him.<ref>Pauline Stafford, 'Edith, Edward's Wife and Queen', in Mortimer ed., ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 137</ref> His successor, [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II]], was probably crowned in the abbey, although the first documented coronation is that of [[William the Conqueror]] later the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/william-the-conqueror |title=William I (the Conqueror) |publisher = Westminster-abbey.org |date=2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916025458/http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/william-the-conqueror |archive-date=16 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The only extant depiction of Edward's abbey, together with the adjacent [[Palace of Westminster]], is in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. Some of the lower parts of the monastic dormitory, an extension of the South Transept, survive in the Norman Undercroft of the Great School, including a door said to come from the previous [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] abbey. Increased endowments supported a community that increased from a dozen monks in Dunstan's original foundation, up to a maximum of about eighty monks.<ref>Harvey 1993, p. 2</ref>

===Construction of the present church===
[[File:London westminster 1894.jpg|thumb|Layout plan dated 1894]]
The [[abbot]] and monks, in proximity to the royal Palace of Westminster, the seat of government from the later 13th century, became a powerful force in the centuries after the Norman Conquest. The [[Abbot of Westminster]] often was employed on royal service and in due course took his place in the [[House of Lords]] as of right. Released from the burdens of spiritual leadership, which passed to the reformed [[Abbey of Cluny|Cluniac movement]] after the mid-10th century, and occupied with the administration of great landed properties, some of which lay far from Westminster, "the Benedictines achieved a remarkable degree of identification with the secular life of their times, and particularly with upper-class life", Barbara Harvey concludes, to the extent that her depiction of daily life provides a wider view of the concerns of the English gentry in the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]].<ref>Harvey 1993</ref>

The proximity of the Palace of Westminster did not extend to providing monks or abbots with high royal connections; in social origin the Benedictines of Westminster were as modest as most of the order. The abbot remained [[Lord of the Manor]] of Westminster as a town of two to three thousand persons grew around it: as a consumer and employer on a grand scale the monastery helped fuel the town economy, and relations with the town remained unusually cordial, but no enfranchising charter was issued during the Middle Ages.<ref>Harvey 1993, p. 6 ff.</ref>

The abbey became the coronation site of Norman kings. None were buried there until Henry III, intensely devoted to the cult of the Confessor, rebuilt the abbey in [[Gothic architecture|Anglo-French Gothic style]] as a shrine to venerate King Edward the Confessor and as a suitably regal setting for Henry's own tomb, under the highest Gothic [[nave]] in England. The Confessor's shrine subsequently played a great part in his [[canonization]].<ref name=wpage/>

Construction of the present church began in 1245 by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]<ref name="History – Westminster Abbey">[http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history History – Westminster Abbey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703161201/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history |date=3 July 2014 }}.

The [[Lady chapel]] built from around 1220 at the extreme eastern end was incorporated into the [[chevet]] of the new building, but was later replaced. This work must have been largely completed by 1258–60, when the second stage was begun. This carried the nave on an additional five bays, bringing it to one bay beyond the ritual [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]. Here construction stopped in about 1269, a consecration ceremony being held on 13 October of that year,<ref>{{Citation|last=Westminster Abbey|title=Welcome to Westminster Abbey|date=2014-09-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ozal9IbFxQ&t=16s|accessdate=2017-07-30}}</ref> and because of Henry's death did not resume.

[[File:Westminster Abbey c1711.jpg|thumb|The Abbey c1711 prior to the north towers being built]]
Henry III also commissioned the unique [[Cosmati]] pavement in front of the High Altar (the pavement has recently undergone a major cleaning and conservation programme and was re-dedicated by the Dean at a service on 21 May 2010).<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosmati pavement|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/art/cosmati-pavement|publisher=Westminster Abbey|accessdate=16 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515073519/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/art/cosmati-pavement|archive-date=15 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] added a [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular style]] chapel dedicated to the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Blessed Virgin Mary]] in 1503 (known as the ''[[Henry VII Chapel]]'' or the "Lady Chapel"). Much of the stone came from [[Caen]], in France ([[Caen stone]]), the [[Isle of Portland]] ([[Portland stone]]) and the [[Loire Valley]] region of France ([[Tuffeau stone|tuffeau limestone]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Architects and Architecture of London|first=Kenneth|last=Allinson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAQBHs4BWXQC&pg=PA31|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-0750683371|page=31}}</ref> The chapel was finished circa 1519.<ref name=":0" />

===16th and 17th centuries: dissolution and restoration===
In 1535 during the assessment attendant on the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], the abbey's annual income was £3,000 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3000|1535|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}}  as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monlib.org.uk/papers/westminster/2007harvey.html|title=The dissolution and Westminster Abbey|first=Barbara|last=Harvey|date=22 November 2007|publisher=Ampleforth Abbey|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015090325/http://www.monlib.org.uk/papers/westminster/2007harvey.html|archive-date=15 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

====1540–1550: 10 years as a cathedral====
[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] assumed direct royal control in 1539 and granted the abbey the status of a cathedral by charter in 1540, simultaneously issuing [[letters patent]] establishing the [[Diocese of Westminster (Church of England)|Diocese of Westminster]]. By granting the abbey cathedral status, Henry VIII gained an excuse to spare it from the destruction or dissolution which he inflicted on most English abbeys during this period.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Abbeys of Great Britain|first=H.

====After 1550: turbulent times====
Westminster diocese was dissolved in 1550, but the abbey was recognised (in 1552, retroactively to 1550) as a second cathedral of the [[Diocese of London]] until 1556.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/abbey-history |title=Abbey History |publisher=Westminster-abbey.org |access-date=8 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214004400/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/abbey-history |archive-date=14 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Duffy, Eamon & Loades, David (eds.)

The abbey was restored to the Benedictines under the Catholic [[Mary I of England]], but they were again ejected under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1559. In 1560, Elizabeth re-established Westminster as a "[[Royal Peculiar]]" – a church of the [[Church of England]] responsible directly to the Sovereign, rather than to a diocesan bishop – and made it the '''Collegiate Church of St Peter''' (that is, a non-cathedral church with an attached chapter of [[canon (priest)|canons]], headed by a dean).<ref name=peculiar>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicansonline.org/uk-europe/england/dioceses/index.html#peculiar|title=England by Diocese|publisher=Anglicans online|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221329/http://www.anglicansonline.org/uk-europe/england/dioceses/index.html#peculiar|archive-date=28 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

It suffered damage during the turbulent 1640s, when it was attacked by [[Puritan]] [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]], but was again protected by its close ties to the state during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period. [[Oliver Cromwell]] was given an elaborate funeral there in 1658, only to be [[Burial#Exhumation|disinterred]] in January 1661 and posthumously hanged from a [[gibbet]] at [[Tyburn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26189#s10 |title=Journal of the House of Commons: volume 8: 1660–1667 |year=1802 |pages=26–7 |author=[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] |access-date=28 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221834/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26189#s10 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=live }} Attainder predated to 1 January 1649 (It is 1648 in the document because of [[Old Style and New Style dates|old style year]])</ref>

===1722–1745: Western towers constructed===

The abbey's two western towers were built between 1722 and 1745 by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], constructed from [[Portland stone]] to an early example of a [[Gothic Revival]] design. [[Purbeck marble]] was used for the walls and the floors of Westminster Abbey, although the various tombstones are made of different types of marble. Further [[Victorian restoration|rebuilding and restoration]] occurred in the 19th century under [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir George Gilbert Scott]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Gleanings from Westminster Abbey / by George Gilbert Scott, with Appendices Supplying Further Particulars, and Completing the History of the Abbey Buildings, by W.

A [[narthex]] (a portico or entrance hall) for the west front was designed by [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]] in the mid-20th century but was not built. Images of the abbey prior to the construction of the towers are scarce, though the abbey's official website states that the building had "towers which had been left unfinished in the medieval period".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/nicholas-hawksmoor/|title=Nicholas Hawksmoor|publisher=Westminster Abbey|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707033703/https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/nicholas-hawksmoor/|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1750 the top of one of the piers on the north side of the Abbey fell down, by earthquake, with the iron and lead that had fastened it. Several houses fell in, and many chimneys were damaged. Another shock had been felt during the preceding month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol3/pp401-411|title=Westminster Abbey: Historical ceremonies &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref>

===Second World War===
Westminster suffered minor damage during [[the Blitz]] on 15 November 1940. Then on 10/11 May 1941, the Westminster Abbey precincts and roof were hit by incendiary bombs. All the bombs were extinguished by [[Air Raid Precaution|ARP]] wardens, except for one bomb which ignited out of reach among the wooden beams and plaster vault of the lantern roof (of 1802) over the North Transept. Flames rapidly spread and burning beams and molten lead began to fall on the wooden stalls, pews and other ecclesiastical fixtures 130 feet below. Despite the falling debris, the staff dragged away as much furniture as possible before withdrawing. Finally the Lantern roof crashed down into the crossing, preventing the fires from spreading further.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westendatwar.org.uk/page_id__186_path__0p28p.aspx|title=Westminster Abbey|publisher=West End at War|first=Ronan|last=Thomas|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221325/http://www.westendatwar.org.uk/page_id__186_path__0p28p.aspx|archive-date=28 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Coronations==
[[File:SanktEdvardsstol westminster.jpg|thumb|[[King Edward's Chair]]]]
{{Main|Coronation of the British monarch|List of British coronations}}

Since the coronation in 1066 of [[William the Conqueror]], every English and British monarch (except [[Edward V]] and [[Edward VIII]], who were never crowned) has been crowned in Westminster Abbey.<ref name="History"/><ref name="Coronations"/> In 1216, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] could not be crowned in London when he came to the throne, because the French prince [[Louis VIII of France|Louis]] had taken control of the city, and so the king was crowned in [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. This coronation was deemed by Pope [[Honorius III]] to be improper, and a further coronation was held in Westminster Abbey on 17 May 1220.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/king_england/henry3.php|title=Henry III, Archonotology.org|accessdate=21 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422015534/http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/king_england/henry3.php|archive-date=22 April 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[King Edward's Chair]] (or St Edward's Chair), the throne on which English and British sovereigns have been seated at the moment of crowning, is now housed within the Abbey in St George's Chapel near the West Door, and has been used at every coronation since 1308. From 1301 to 1996 (except for a short time in 1950 when the stone was temporarily stolen by [[Scottish nationalist]]s), the chair also housed the [[Stone of Scone]] upon which the kings of Scots are crowned. Although the Stone is now kept in Scotland, in [[Edinburgh Castle]], it is intended that the Stone will be returned to St Edward's Chair for use during future coronation ceremonies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38064299 |title=The Stone still waiting for its final destiny |work=BBC |date=28 November 2016 |access-date=2017-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215032752/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38064299 |archive-date=15 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Henry III of England|Henry III]] rebuilt the abbey in honour of a royal saint, [[Edward the Confessor]], whose relics were placed in a [[shrine]] in the sanctuary. Henry III himself was interred nearby, as were many of the [[Plantagenet]] kings of England, their wives and other relatives. Until the death of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] in 1760, most kings and queens were buried in the abbey, some notable exceptions being [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] who are buried in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]].

From the Middle Ages, aristocrats were buried inside chapels, while monks and other people associated with the abbey were buried in the [[cloister]]s and other areas. One of these was [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who was buried here as he had apartments in the abbey where he was employed as master of the King's Works. Other poets, writers and musicians were buried or memorialised around Chaucer in what became known as [[Poets' Corner]]. Abbey musicians such as [[Henry Purcell]] were also buried in their place of work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/henry-purcell2|title=Henry Purcell & family|website=www.westminster-abbey.org|access-date=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202031303/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/henry-purcell2|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the floor, just inside the Great West Door, in the centre of the nave, is the tomb of [[The Unknown Warrior]], an unidentified British soldier killed on a European battlefield during the [[First World War]]. He was buried in the abbey on 11 November 1920. This grave is the only one in the abbey on which it is forbidden to walk.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://branches.britishlegion.org.uk/branches/shipston/remembrance/the-tomb-of-the-unknown-warrior/ |title=The Tomb of The Unknown Warrior |publisher=British Legion |access-date=29 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920143858/http://branches.britishlegion.org.uk/branches/shipston/remembrance/the-tomb-of-the-unknown-warrior/ |archive-date=20 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

At the east end of the Lady Chapel is a memorial chapel to the airmen of the [[Royal Air Force]] who were killed in the [[Second World War]]. It incorporates a memorial window to the [[Battle of Britain]], which replaces an earlier Tudor stained glass window destroyed in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visit-us/abbey-treasures/the-royal-air-force-chapel|title=The Royal Air Force Chapel|publisher=Official website|accessdate=8 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922171704/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visit-us/abbey-treasures/the-royal-air-force-chapel|archive-date=22 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Diana's funeral.jpg|thumb|Funeral procession of Diana, Princess of Wales, at Westminster]]
On 6 September 1997 the formal, though not "state" [[funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]], was held. It was a royal ceremonial funeral including royal pageantry and Anglican funeral liturgy. A second public service was held on Sunday at the demand of the people. The burial occurred privately later the same day. Diana's former husband, sons, mother, siblings, a close friend, and a clergyman were present. Diana's body was clothed in a black long-sleeved dress designed by [[Catherine Walker (fashion designer)|Catherine Walker]], which she had chosen some weeks before. A set of rosary beads was placed in her hands, a gift she had received from [[Mother Teresa]], who died a day before Diana's funeral. Her grave is on the grounds of her family estate, [[Althorp]], on a private island.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/diana/althorp.html |title=Diana Returns Home |work=BBC News |date=1997 |accessdate=21 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025075722/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/diana/althorp.html |archive-date=25 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1998 ten vacant statue niches on the façade above the Great West Door were filled with representative [[Westminster Abbey Burials and Memorials#20th Century Martyrs|20th-century Christian martyrs]] of various denominations. Those commemorated are [[Maximilian Kolbe]], [[Manche Masemola]], [[Janani Luwum]], [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth of Russia]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Óscar Romero]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Esther John]], [[Lucian Tapiedi]], and [[Wang Zhiming (Christian)|Wang Zhiming]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jenny E. |last=Heller |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E6DF1030F931A1575AC0A96E958260 |title=Westminster Abbey Elevates 10 Foreigners |newspaper=The New York Times |date=22 September 1998 |accessdate=21 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819111136/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E6DF1030F931A1575AC0A96E958260 |archive-date=19 August 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Streeter |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/heritage-westminster-abbey-prepares-modern-martyrs-corner-1236492.html |title=Heritage: Westminster Abbey prepares modern martyrs' corner |newspaper=The Independent |date=17 October 1997 |accessdate=21 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820055329/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/heritage-westminster-abbey-prepares-modern-martyrs-corner-1236492.html |archive-date=20 August 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 9 April 2002 the [[Funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|ceremonial funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] was held in the abbey.

At the same time, the ashes of the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]]'s daughter, [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]], who had died on 9 February 2002, were also interred in a private family service.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1919541.stm |title=Queen Mother is laid to rest |date=10 April 2002 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913135935/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1919541.stm |archive-date=13 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Schools ==
[[Westminster School]] and [[Westminster Abbey Choir School]] are also in the precincts of the abbey. The Choir School educates and trains the choirboys who sing for services in the Abbey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcwtoday.co.uk/2017/09/interview-jonathan-milton/|title=Making all the right noises: An Interview with Jonathan Milton, headmaster of the Westminster Abbey Choir School|date=15 September 2017|publisher=KCW Today|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110190946/http://www.kcwtoday.co.uk/2017/09/interview-jonathan-milton/|archive-date=10 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Music==
[[File:Westminster Abbey Choir.jpg|thumb|President [[George W. Bush]] greets the Westminster Abbey Choir]]
Westminster Abbey is renowned for its choral tradition, and the repertoire of [[Anglican church music]] is heard in daily worship, particularly at the service of [[Choral Evensong]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Westminster Abbey : Choral Evensong|url=https://www.choralevensong.org/westminster-abbey-15.php|website=choralevensong.org|accessdate=12 October 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012202102/https://www.choralevensong.org/westminster-abbey-15.php|archive-date=12 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Choral services|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/music/choral-services|website=Westminster Abbey|accessdate=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013009/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/music/choral-services|archive-date=13 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Organ===
{{See also|List of Westminster Abbey organists}}
The organ was built by [[Harrison & Harrison]] in 1937, then with four manuals and 84 speaking stops, and was used for the first time at the coronation of [[King George VI]]. Some pipework from the previous Hill organ of 1848 was revoiced and incorporated in the new scheme. The two organ cases, designed and built in the late 19th century by [[John Loughborough Pearson]], were re-instated and coloured in 1959.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N00646 |title=N00646 |publisher=Npor.org.uk |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

In 1982 and 1987, Harrison and Harrison enlarged the organ under the direction of the then abbey organist [[Simon Preston]] to include an additional Lower Choir Organ and a Bombarde Organ: the current instrument now has five manuals and 109 speaking stops. In 2006, the console of the organ was refurbished by Harrison and Harrison, and space was prepared for two additional 16&nbsp;ft stops on the Lower Choir Organ and the Bombarde Organ.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The current [[Organist and Master of the Choristers]], [[James O'Donnell (organist)|James O'Donnell]], has been in post since 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/artist_page.asp?name=odonnell|title=James O'Donnell (conductor)|publisher=Hyperion Records|accessdate=24 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408172225/http://hyperion-records.co.uk/artist_page.asp?name=odonnell|archive-date=8 April 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Bells==
The bells at the abbey were overhauled in 1971. The [[ring of bells|ring]] is now made up of ten bells, hung for [[change ringing]], cast in 1971 by the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]], tuned to the notes: F#, E, D, C#, B, A, G, F#, E and D. The Tenor bell in D (588.5&nbsp;Hz) has a weight of 30&nbsp;cwt, 1&nbsp;qtr, 15&nbsp;lb (3403&nbsp;lb or 1544&nbsp;kg).<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=westminster&numPerPage=10&Submit=++Go++&searchAmount=%3D&searchMetric=cwt&sortBy=Place&sortDir=Asc&DoveID=WESTMINS+A Westminster—Collegiate Church of S Peter (Westminster Abbey)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816141344/https://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=westminster&numPerPage=10&Submit=++Go++&searchAmount=%253D&searchMetric=cwt&sortBy=Place&sortDir=Asc&DoveID=WESTMINS+A |date=16 August 2019 }}, [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]], 25 October 2006. Retrieved 16 October 2008.</ref>

In addition there are two service bells, cast by Robert Mot, in 1585 and 1598 respectively, a Sanctus bell cast in 1738 by [[Richard Phelps (bell-founder)|Richard Phelps]] and Thomas Lester and two unused bells – one cast about 1320, by the successor to R de Wymbish, and a second cast in 1742, by Thomas Lester.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The two service bells and the 1320 bell, along with a fourth small silver "dish bell", kept in the refectory, have been noted as being of historical importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchcare.co.uk/bells.php|title=Database of Historically Significant Bells and Bell Frames|work=Churchcare website|quote=search on "Westminster Abbey" for bell details|publisher=[[Church of England]]|date=1 April 2008|accessdate=16 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729191709/http://www.churchcare.co.uk/bells.php|archivedate=29 July 2010}}</ref>

==Chapter house==
[[File:London_-_Westminster_abbey_-_chapter_house_03.jpg|thumb|upright|The chapter house]]

The [[chapter house]] was built concurrently with the east parts of the abbey under Henry III, between about 1245 and 1253.<ref name=Scott1863>{{cite book|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gleaningsfromwe01scotgoog/page/n93 41]–43, 56–58|url=https://archive.org/details/gleaningsfromwe01scotgoog|title=Gleanings from Westminster abbey|publisher=J. Henry and J. Parker|author1=Scott|first1=Sir George Gilbert|year=1863}}</ref> It was [[Victorian restoration|restored]] by [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]] in 1872. The entrance is approached from the east cloister walk and includes a double doorway with a large tympanum above.<ref name=Scott1863/>

Inner and outer vestibules lead to the octagonal chapter house, which is of exceptional architectural purity. It is built in a Geometrical Gothic style with an octagonal crypt below. A pier of eight shafts carries the vaulted ceiling. To the sides are blind arcading, remains of 14th-century paintings and numerous stone benches above which are innovatory large 4-light quatre-foiled windows.<ref name=Scott1863/> These are virtually contemporary with the [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris.<ref name=Scott1863/>

The chapter house has an original mid-13th-century tiled pavement. A door within the vestibule dates from around 1050 and is believed to be the oldest in England.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1003579|desc=The Chapter House and Pyx Chamber in the abbey cloisters, Westminster Abbey|accessdate=2017-01-20}}</ref> The exterior includes flying buttresses added in the 14th century and a leaded tent-lantern roof on an iron frame designed by Scott. The Chapter house was originally used in the 13th century by Benedictine monks for daily meetings. It later became a meeting place of the King's Great Council and the Commons, predecessors of Parliament.<ref name=eh>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/chapter-house-and-pyx-chamber/|title=Chapter house and Pyx Chamber|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221719/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/chapter-house-and-pyx-chamber/|archive-date=28 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Pyx Chamber formed the undercroft of the monks' dormitory. It dates to the late 11th century and was used as a monastic and royal treasury. The outer walls and circular piers are of 11th-century date, several of the capitals were enriched in the 12th century and the stone altar added in the 13th century. The term ''pyx'' refers to the boxwood chest in which coins were held and presented to a jury during the [[Trial of the Pyx]], in which newly minted coins were presented to ensure they conformed to the required standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalmint.com/discover/uk-coins/history-of-the-trial-of-the-pyx/|title=History of the Trial of the Pyx|publisher=The Royal Mint|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221525/https://www.royalmint.com/discover/uk-coins/history-of-the-trial-of-the-pyx/|archive-date=28 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The chapter house and Pyx Chamber at Westminster Abbey are in the guardianship of [[English Heritage]], but under the care and management of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.<ref name=eh/>

==Museum==
The [[Westminster Abbey Museum]] was located in the 11th-century [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] [[undercroft]] beneath the former monks' dormitory in Westminster Abbey. This was one of the oldest areas of the abbey, dating back almost to the foundation of the church by [[Edward the Confessor]] in 1065. This space had been used as a museum since 1908<ref>Trowles 2008, p. 156</ref> but was closed to the public in June 2018, when it was replaced as a museum by the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries, high up in the Abbey [[triforium]].<ref name=gallery/>
