'''Pale lager''' is a very [[Pale (color)|pale]]-to-[[Gold (color)|golden]]-colored [[lager]] [[beer]] with a well-[[Attenuation (brewing)|attenuated body]] and a varying degree of [[Noble hops|noble hop]] [[Bitterness (taste)|bitterness]].

The [[brewing]] process for this beer developed in the mid-19th century, when Gabriel Sedlmayr took [[pale ale]] brewing techniques back to the [[Spaten Brewery]] in Germany and applied them to existing [[lager]]ing methods. This approach was picked up by other brewers, most notably [[Josef Groll]] of [[Bavaria]], who produced [[Pilsner Urquell]] in the city of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Plzeň]] in the [[Czech Republic]]). The resulting [[Pilsner]] beers—pale-colored, lean and stable—gradually spread around the globe to become the most common form of beer consumed in the world today.

== History ==
[[File:Pilsner_urquell_mug.jpg|thumb|upright|First [[Pilsner]] beer: [[Pilsner Urquell]]]]
Bavarian [[brewery|brewers]] in the sixteenth century were required by law to brew beer only during the cooler months of the year. In order to have beer available during the hot summer months, beers would be stored (lagered) in caves and stone cellars, often under blocks of ice.

In the period 1820–1830, a brewer named Gabriel Sedlmayr II the Younger, whose family was running the [[Spaten Brewery]] in Bavaria, went around [[Europe]] to improve his brewing skills. When he returned, he used what he had learned to get a more stable and consistent lager beer. The Bavarian lager was still different from the widely known modern lager; due to the use of dark malts it was quite dark, representing what is now called [[Dunkel]] beer or the stronger variety, [[bock]] beer.

The new recipe of the improved lager beer spread quickly over Europe. In particular Sedlmayr's friend [[Anton Dreher]] adopted new kilning techniques that enabled the use of lighter malts to improve the Viennese beer in 1840–1841, creating a rich amber-red colored [[Vienna lager|Vienna-style]] lager.

== Description ==
Pale lagers tend to be dry, lean, clean-tasting and crisp. Flavors may be subtle, with no traditional beer ingredient dominating the others. [[Hops|Hop]] character (bitterness, flavor, and aroma) ranges from negligible to a dry bitterness from [[noble hops]]. The main ingredients are water, [[Pilsner malt]] and [[noble hops]], though some brewers use [[adjuncts]] such as [[rice]] or [[maize|corn]] to lighten the body of the beer. There tends to be no [[butterscotch]] flavor from [[diacetyl]], due to the slow, cold fermentation process.

Alcohol ([[ethanol]]) content is typically c.4% or more.<ref>https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/alcohol-facts/alcoholic-drinks-units/lager/</ref>

== Variations ==

=== Pilsner ===
{{Main|Pilsner}}

Pale lager was developed in the mid 19th century, when Gabriel Sedlmayr took some British [[pale ale]] brewing techniques back to the Spaten Brewery in Germany, and started to modernize continental brewing methods. In 1842 [[Josef Groll]] of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], a city in western [[Bohemia]] in what is now the [[Czech Republic]], used some of these methods to produce ''[[Pilsner Urquell]]'', the first known example of a golden lager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000255.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter—The birth of lager |publisher=Beerhunter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> This beer proved so successful that other breweries followed the trend, using the name [[Pilsner]]. Breweries now use the terms "lager" and "Pilsner" interchangeably, though pale lagers from Germany and the Czech Republic with the name Pilsner tend to have more evident noble hop aroma and dry finish than other pale lagers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/styles/pilsener.pilsner.pils.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter—Beer Styles: Pilsener/Pilsner/Pils |publisher=Beerhunter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://beer-pages.co.uk/stories/complete-guide-beer.htm |title=Roger Protz Complete Guide to World Beer |publisher=beer-pages.com |date=2004-12-04 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

=== Dortmunder Export ===
{{main|Dortmunder Export}}
With the success of Pilsen's golden beer, the town of [[Dortmund]] in Germany started brewing pale lager in 1873. As Dortmund was a major brewing center, and the town breweries grouped together to export the beer beyond the town, the brand name
''[[Dortmunder Export]]'' became known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/dortmund.htm |title=all you need to know about beer |publisher=beer-pages.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> Today, breweries in Denmark, the Netherlands, and North America brew pale lagers labelled as Dortmunder Export.

=== Helles ===

"Helles" or "hell" is a traditional German pale lager, produced chiefly in [[Southern Germany]], particularly [[Munich]]. The German word "hell" can be translated as "bright", "light", or "pale". In 1894, the Spaten Brewery in [[Munich]] noticed the commercial success of the pale lagers [[Pilsner]] and [[Dortmunder Export]]; Spaten utilized the methods that Sedlmayr had brought home over 50 years earlier to produce their own pale lager they named helles, which is German for "light coloured", in order to distinguish it from the darker, sweeter beers from that region: [[Dunkel]]bier or dunkles Bier ("dark beer").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/helles.html |title=Helles |publisher=Germanbeerinstitute.com |accessdate=2014-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410090051/http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/helles.html |archivedate=2016-04-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.germanbeerguide.co.uk/helles.html |title=Münchner Helles |publisher=German Beer Guide |date=2002-05-16 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> Initially other Munich breweries were reluctant to brew pale-coloured beer, though as the popularity of pale beers grew, so gradually other breweries in Munich and Bavaria began brewing pale lager either using the name hell or pils.<ref name=Seidl>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYVLHMmplRcC&pg=PA429|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|chapter=Helles|author=Conrad Seidl|pages=430–431|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 9 Sep 2011|isbn=9780195367133}}</ref> Today, in Munich and Bavaria pale lagers termed helles, hell, pils or gold remain popular, with a local inclination to use low levels of hops, and an abv in the range 4.7% to 5.4% abv; Munich breweries which produce such pale lagers include [[Löwenbräu]], [[Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München]], [[Augustiner Bräu]], and [[Hacker-Pschorr]]; with [[Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu]] producing a 5.2% abv pale lager called ''Spaten Munchner Hell''.<ref name=Seidl/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerdrinkersguide.com/BDGWebsite/MunichBeer/BigSix.htm|title=The Big Six|author=Larry Hawthorne|publisher=beerdrinkersguide.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/munibrew.htm|publisher=europeanbeerguide.net|title=Munich Breweries|author=Ronald Pattinson}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://87.106.244.19/SPATEN/3_produkte_markenwelt/3_1_produkte/3_1_1_sortiment/hell/index.php|title=Spaten Münchner Hell|publisher= spaten.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/spaten-munchner-hell--munchen--premium/2559/|title=Spaten Münchner Hell / München / Premium|publisher=ratebeer.com}}</ref>

=== American lager ===
{{main|American lager}}
The earliest known brewing of pale lager in [[Beer in the United States|America]] was in the [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City]] section of Philadelphia by John Wagner in 1840 using yeast from his native Bavaria.<ref name="LaBan, Craig (February 2015)">{{cite news|last1=LaBan|first1=Craig|title=PA Brewers Take Aim at Teutonic Traditions|url=http://articles.philly.com/2015-02-20/food/59309384_1_craft-beer-beer-festivals-bill-covaleski|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=TCA Regional News|date=February 19, 2015|location=Chicago}}</ref> Modern [[American lager]]s are usually made by large breweries such as [[Anheuser-Busch]]. Lightness of body is a cardinal virtue, both by design and since it allows the use of a high percentage of rice or [[maize|corn]].

=== Dry beer ===
Though all lagers are well [[Attenuation (brewing)|attenuated]], a more fully fermented pale lager in Germany goes by the name ''Diät-Pils'' or ''{{ill|Diätbier|de}}''. "Diet" in the instance not referring to being "light" in calories or body, rather its sugars are fully fermented into alcohol, allowing the beer to be targeted to diabetics due to its lower carbohydrate content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/styles/diat_pils.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter—Beer Styles: Diat Pils |publisher=Beerhunter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> Because the available sugars are fully fermented, dry beers often have a higher alcohol content, which may be reduced in the same manner as [[low-alcohol beer]]s. 

The first dry beer, ''Gablinger's Diet Beer'', was released in 1967, developed by [[Joseph Owades]] at [[Rheingold Breweries]] in Brooklyn. Owades developed an enzyme that could further break down starches, so that the finished product contained fewer residual carbohydrates and was lower in [[food energy]].<ref>[https://www.truthinadvertising.org/miller-just-say-invented-light-beer/ www.truthinadvertising.org]</ref> 

Since the 2012 revisions to the ''{{ill|Diätverordnung|de}}'' (Ordinance on Dietetic Foodstuffs), it is no longer permitted to label beer as "Diät" in Germany, but it may be advertised as "suitable for diabetics". Prior to this change, a ''Diätbier'' could contain no more than 7.5&nbsp;g of unfermented carbohydrates per liter (a typical lager contains 30-40&nbsp;g/L), and the alcohol content could not exceed normal levels (5% ABV).

A marketing term for a fully attenuated pale lager, originally used in Japan by [[Asahi Breweries]] in 1987, {{Nihongo|"karakuchi"|辛口|dry}},<ref>[http://www.asahibeer.co.jp/english/products/development1.html#02 Asahi Breweries | Products | Asahi Super Dry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629185638/http://www.asahibeer.co.jp/english/products/development1.html#02 |date=June 29, 2006 }}</ref> was taken up by the American brewer [[Anheuser-Busch]] in 1988 as "dry beer" for the Michelob brand, ''Michelob Dry''.<ref>Philip Van Munching, Beer Blast, pp 232-233, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8129-6391-1}}</ref> This was followed by other "dry beer" brands such as [[Bud Dry]], though the marketing concept was not considered a success.<ref>Philip Van Munching, ''Beer Blast'', pp. 233–235, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8129-6391-1}}</ref>

=== Premium lager ===
Premium lager is a marketing term sometimes used by brewers for products they wish to promote; there is no legal definition for such a product, but it can be meaningfully applied to an all-malt product of around 5% abv. Anheuser-Busch also uses the terms "sub-premium" and "super-premium" to describe the low-end [[Busch Beer|Busch beer]] and the slightly higher-end [[Michelob]].

== Strong lager ==
Pale lagers that exceed an [[Alcohol by volume|abv]] of around 5.8% are variously termed [[bock]], [[malt liquor]], super strength lager, Oktoberfestbier/Märzen, or European strong lager.

=== Bock ===
{{Main|Bock}}
Bock is a strong lager which has origins in the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] town of [[Einbeck]] in Germany. The name is a [[Corruption (grammar)|corruption]] of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] German brewing town of Einbeck, but also means billy goat (buck) in German. The original bocks were dark beers, brewed from high-colored [[malt]]s. Modern bocks can be dark, amber or pale in color. Bock was traditionally brewed for special occasions, often religious festivals such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] or [[Lent]].

=== Malt liquor ===
{{Main|Malt liquor}}
Malt liquor is an American term referring to a strong pale lager. In the UK, similarly-made beverages are called super-strength lager.

=== Oktoberfestbier/Märzen ===
{{main|Märzen}}
[[File:Paulaner Oktoberfest Marzen 11.2oz bottle and beer mug.jpg|thumb|right|A mug of [[Paulaner]] Oktoberfest beer]]
[[Oktoberfest]] is a German festival dating from 1810, and Oktoberfestbiers are the beers that have been served at the festival since 1818, and are supplied by six breweries: [[Spaten]], [[Löwenbräu]], [[Augustiner Bräu|Augustiner-Bräu]], [[Hofbräuhaus|Hofbräu-München]], [[Paulaner]] and [[Hacker-Pschorr]].<ref name=Oxford>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga4MYyZq-RMC&pg=PA624|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|pages=624–625|author=Conrad Seidl|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=9 Sep 2011|accessdate=14 November 2012|isbn=9780195367133}}</ref> Traditionally Oktoberfestbiers were the lagers of around 5.5 to 6 abv called ''Märzen'', brewed in March and allowed to ferment slowly during the summer months. Originally these would have been [[dark lagers]], but from 1872 a strong March brewed version of an amber-red [[Vienna lager]] made by Josef Sedlmayr became the favorite Oktoberfestbier.<ref name=Oxford/> The color of Märzen and so Oktoberfestbier has become even lighter since the late 20th century, with all Oktoberfest beers brewed in Munich since 1990 being golden in color;<ref name=Oxford/> though some Munich brewers still produce darker versions, mostly for export to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000255.html|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter—The birth of lager|publisher=www.beerhunter.com|accessdate=2008-05-04|last=Jackson |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Jackson (writer)}}</ref>

Oktoberfestbier is a [[registered trademark]] of the big six Munich breweries, who call themselves the Club of Munich Brewers. Oktoberfestbier is also known as Munich beer, and—along with Bavarian beer—Munich beer is protected by the [[European Union]] as a [[Protected Geographical Indication]] (PGI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerdrinkersguide.com/BDGWebsite/MunichBeer/BigSix.htm|title=Big Six Breweries in Munich|publisher=www.beerdrinkersguide.com|accessdate=2008-05-04}}</ref>
