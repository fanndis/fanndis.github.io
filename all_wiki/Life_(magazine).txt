'''''Life''''' was an American magazine published weekly from 1883 to 1972, as an intermittent "special" until 1978, and as a monthly from 1978 until 2000. During its golden age from 1936 to 1972, ''Life'' was a wide-ranging weekly general interest magazine known for the quality of its [[photography]].

''Life'' was independently published for its first 53 years until 1936 as a general-interest and [[light entertainment]] magazine, heavy on illustrations, jokes, and social commentary. It featured some of the greatest writers, editors, illustrators and cartoonists of its time: [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[Norman Rockwell]] and [[Jacob Hartman Jr]]. Gibson became the editor and owner of the magazine after [[John Ames Mitchell]] died in 1918. During its later years, the magazine offered brief capsule reviews (similar to those in ''[[The New Yorker]]'') of plays and movies currently running in [[New York City]], but with the innovative touch of a colored typographic bullet resembling a traffic light, appended to each review: green for a positive review, red for a negative one, and amber for mixed notices.

In 1936, ''Time'' publisher [[Henry Luce]] bought ''Life'', only wanting its title: he greatly re-made the publication. ''Life'' became the first all-photographic American news magazine, and it dominated the market for several decades. The magazine sold more than 13.5 million copies a week at one point. Possibly the best-known photograph published in the magazine was [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]]'s [[V-J Day in Times Square|photograph of a nurse in a sailor's arms]], taken on August 14, 1945, as they celebrated [[Victory over Japan Day]] in New York City. The magazine's role in the history of photojournalism is considered its most important contribution to publishing. ''Life''{{'}}s profile was such that the [[memoir]]s of President [[Harry S. Truman]], Sir [[Winston Churchill]] and General [[Douglas MacArthur]] were all serialized in its pages.

After 2000, [[Time Inc.]] continued to use the ''Life'' brand for special and commemorative issues. ''Life'' returned to regularly scheduled issues when it became a weekly newspaper supplement from 2004 to 2007.<ref name="timetoclose">{{cite press release|title=Time Inc. to Close LIFE Magazine Newspaper Supplement|publisher=Time Warner|date=March 26, 2007|url=https://www.warnermediagroup.com/newsroom/press-releases/2007/03/26/time-inc-to-close-life-magazine-newspaper-supplement|archive-date=January 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105133059/http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1602884,00.html}}</ref> The website life.com, originally one of the channels on Time Inc.'s [[Pathfinder.com|Pathfinder]] service, was for a time in the late 2000s managed as a joint venture with [[Getty Images]] under the name See Your World, LLC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time Inc.

==History==
===Humor and general Interest magazine===
[[File:LIFEMagazine24Jan1924.jpg|thumb|Cover of 24 Jan 1924 issue]]
''Life'' was founded January 4, 1883, in a [[New York City]] artist's studio at 1155 Broadway, as a partnership between [[John Ames Mitchell]] and [[Andrew Miller (publisher)|Andrew Miller]]. Mitchell held a 75% interest in the magazine with the remaining 25% held by Miller. Both men retained their holdings until their deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/miscellaneousre11yorkgoog/miscellaneousre11yorkgoog_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "The miscellaneous reports: cases decided in the inferior courts of record of the state of New York" |access-date=2012-01-15}}</ref> Miller served as secretary-treasurer of the magazine and was very successful managing the business side of the operation. Mitchell, a 37-year-old illustrator who used a $10,000 inheritance to invest in the weekly magazine, served as its publisher. He also created the first ''Life'' name-plate with [[cupid]]s as mascots and later on, drew its masthead of a knight leveling his lance at the posterior of a fleeing devil. Then he took advantage of a revolutionary new printing process using zinc-coated plates, which improved the reproduction of his illustrations and artwork. This edge helped because ''Life'' faced stiff competition from the best-selling humor magazines ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'' and [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'']], which were already established and successful. [[Edward Sandford Martin]] was brought on as ''Life'''s first literary editor; the recent [[Harvard University]] graduate was a founder of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]].''

The motto of the first issue of ''Life'' was:  "While there's Life, there's hope."<ref name="Alive"/> The new magazine set forth its principles and policies to its readers:
<blockquote>"We wish to have some fun in this paper...We shall try to domesticate as much as possible of the casual cheerfulness that is drifting about in an unfriendly world...We shall have something to say about religion, about politics, fashion, society, literature, the stage, the stock exchange, and the police station, and we will speak out what is in our mind as fairly, as truthfully, and as decently as we know how."<ref name="Alive">{{cite journal|date=October 19, 1936|title=Life: Dead & Alive|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,756798,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127201828/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,756798,00.html|archive-date=January 27, 2011|journal=TIME}}</ref></blockquote>

The magazine was a success and soon attracted the industry's leading contributors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/search_list.php?search=Life_Magazine|title=Old Magazine Articles|website=www.oldmagazinearticles.com}}</ref> Among the most important was [[Charles Dana Gibson]]. Three years after the magazine was founded, the [[Massachusetts]] native first sold ''Life'' a drawing for $4: a dog outside his kennel howling at the moon. Encouraged by a publisher, also an artist, Gibson was joined in ''Life'' early days by well-known illustrators such as: [[Palmer Cox]] (creator of the [[Brownie (elf)|Brownie]]), [[A. B. Frost]], [[Oliver Herford]] and [[E. W. Kemble]]. ''Life'' attracted an impressive literary roster too: [[John Kendrick Bangs]], [[James Whitcomb Riley]] and [[Brander Matthews]] all wrote for the magazine around the start of the 20th century.

Mitchell was accused of [[anti-Semitism]] at a time of high rates of immigration to New York of eastern European [[Jews]]. When the magazine blamed the theatrical team of [[Klaw & Erlanger]] for Chicago's grisly [[Iroquois Theater Fire]] in 1903, a national uproar ensued. ''Life''{{'s}} drama critic, [[James Stetson Metcalfe]], was barred from the 47 Manhattan theatres controlled by the [[Theatrical Syndicate]]. ''Life'' published caricatured cartoons of Jews with enormous noses.

''Life'' became a place that discovered new talent; this was particularly true among illustrators. In 1908 [[Robert Ripley]] published his first cartoon in ''Life'', 20 years before his ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Believe It or Not!]]'' fame. [[Norman Rockwell]]'s first cover for ''Life'' magazine, ''Tain't You'', was published May 10, 1917. His paintings were featured on ''Life''{{'s}} cover 28 times between 1917-1924. [[Rea Irvin]], the first art director of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and creator of the character "[[Eustace Tilley]]", got his start drawing covers for ''Life''.

[[Charles Dana Gibson]] dreamed up the magazine's most celebrated figure in its early decades. His creation, the [[Gibson Girl]], was a tall, regal beauty. After appearances in ''Life'' in the 1890s, the image of the elegant Gibson Girl became the nation's feminine ideal. She was a publishing sensation and earned a place in fashion history.

This version of ''Life'' took sides in politics and international affairs, and published fiery pro-American editorials. Mitchell and Gibson were incensed when [[Germany]] attacked [[Belgium]]; in 1914 they undertook a campaign to push the U.S. into the war. Seven years studying at [[Paris]] art schools made him partial to the French; there was no unbiased coverage of the war. Gibson drew the [[Kaiser]] as a bloody madman, insulting [[Uncle Sam]], sneering at crippled soldiers, and shooting [[Red Cross]] nurses. Mitchell lived just long enough to see ''Life''{{'s}} crusade result in the 1917 [[American entry into World War I|U.S. declaration of war]].

Following Mitchell's death in 1918, Gibson bought the magazine for $1 million, but the world had changed. It was not the [[Gay Nineties]], when family-style humor prevailed and the chaste Gibson Girls wore floor-length dresses. [[World War I]] had spurred changing tastes among the magazine-reading public. ''Life''{{'s}} brand of fun, clean and cultivated humor began to pale before the new variety: crude, sexy and cynical. ''Life'' struggled to compete on newsstands with such risqué rivals. A little more than three years after purchasing ''Life'', Gibson quit and turned the decaying property over to publisher [[Clair Maxwell]] and treasurer [[Henry Richter (treasurer)|Henry Richter]]. Gibson retired to [[Maine]] to paint and lost active interest in the magazine, which he left deeply in the red.

[[File:LifeFlapper1922.jpg|thumb|upright|left|1922 cover, "The [[Flapper]]" by F. X. Leyendecker]]

In 1920, Gibson selected former ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' staffer [[Robert E. Sherwood]] as editor. A [[World War I|WWI]] veteran and member of the [[Algonquin Round Table]], Sherwood tried to inject sophisticated humor onto the pages. ''Life'' published [[Ivy League]] jokes, cartoons, [[flapper]] sayings and all-burlesque issues. Beginning in 1920, ''Life'' undertook a crusade against [[Prohibition]]. It also tapped the humorous writings of [[Frank Sullivan (writer)|Frank Sullivan]], [[Robert Benchley]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Franklin Pierce Adams]] and [[Corey Ford]]. Among the illustrators and cartoonists were [[Ralph Barton]], [[Percy Crosby]], [[Don Herold]], [[Ellison Hoover]], [[H. T. Webster]], [[Art Young]] and [[John Held, Jr.]]

''Life'' had 250,000 readers in 1920{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}, but as the [[Jazz Age]] rolled into the [[Great Depression]], the magazine lost money and subscribers. By the time Maxwell and editor [[George Eggleston]] took over, ''Life'' had switched from publishing weekly to monthly. The two men went to work revamping its editorial style to meet the times, and in the process it won new readers. Despite all-star talents on staff, ''Life'' had passed its prime and was sliding toward financial ruin. ''[[The New Yorker]]'', debuting in February 1925, copied many of the features and styles of ''Life''; it recruited staff from its editorial and art departments. Another blow to ''Life''{{'s}} circulation came from raunchy humor periodicals such as ''[[Ballyhoo (magazine)|Ballyhoo]]'' and ''[[Hooey]]'', which ran what can be termed "[[outhouse]]" gags. In 1933, ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' joined ''Life''{{'s}} competitors.  In its final years, ''Life'' struggled to make a profit.

Announcing the end of ''Life'', Maxwell declared: "We cannot claim, like Mr. [[Gene Tunney]], that we resigned our championship undefeated in our prime. But at least we hope to retire gracefully from a world still friendly."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

For ''Life''{{'s}} final issue in its original format, 80-year-old Edward Sandford Martin was recalled from editorial retirement to compose its obituary. He wrote: 
<blockquote>"That ''Life'' should be passing into the hands of new owners and directors is of the liveliest interest to the sole survivor of the little group that saw it born in January 1883...As for me, I wish it all good fortune; grace, mercy and peace and usefulness to a distracted world that does not know which way to turn nor what will happen to it next. A wonderful time for a new voice to make a noise that needs to be heard!"<ref name="Alive" /></blockquote>

In 1936, publisher [[Henry Luce]] paid $92,000 to the owners of ''Life'' magazine because he sought the name for his company, [[Time Inc]]. Time Inc. sold ''Life''{{'s}} subscription list, features, and goodwill to ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]''. Convinced that pictures could tell a story instead of just illustrating text, Luce launched the new ''Life'' on November 23, 1936. The third magazine published by Luce, after ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1923 and [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'']] in 1930, ''Life'' developed as the definitive photo magazine in the U.S., giving as much space and importance to images as to words. The first issue of ''Life'', which sold for ten cents (worth ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.10|1936|r=2}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}), featured five pages of Alfred Eisenstaedt's photographs.

In planning the weekly news magazine, Luce circulated a confidential prospectus,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://life.tumblr.com/post/17551327132/to-see-life-to-see-the-world-to-eyewitness|title= Life: A Prospectus for a New Magazine|website=life.tumblr.com}}</ref> within Time Inc. in 1936, which described his vision for the new ''Life'' magazine, and what he viewed as its unique purpose. ''Life'' magazine was to be the first publication, with a focus on photographs, that enabled the American public,

<blockquote>To see life; to see the world; to eyewitness great events; to watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud; to see strange things — machines, armies, multitudes, shadows in the jungle and on the moon; to see man’s work — his paintings, towers and discoveries; to see things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within rooms, things dangerous to come to; the women that men love and many children; to see and take pleasure in seeing; to see and be amazed; to see and be instructed...<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160306080711/http://time.com/3875143/life-in-2012-the-year-in-12-galleries/ LIFE in 2012: The Year in 12 Galleries]. Retrieved September 24, 2015</ref></blockquote>

Luce's first issue cover depicted the [[Fort Peck Dam]] in [[Montana]], a [[Works Progress Administration]] project, photographed by [[Margaret Bourke-White]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Very First Issues of 19 Famous Magazines|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/50299/very-first-issues-19-famous-magazines|last=French|first=Alex|work=[[Mental Floss]]|access-date=12 August 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Herald Square Hotel jeh.JPG|thumb|left|upright|19 West 31st Street]]
The format of ''Life'' in 1936 was an instant classic: the text was condensed into captions for 50 pages of photographs. The magazine was printed on heavily [[coated paper]] and cost readers only a dime. The magazine's circulation skyrocketed beyond the company's predictions, going from 380,000 copies of the first issue to more than one million a week four months later.<ref>"[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930895,00.html Pictorial to Sleep]", ''Time'', March 8, 1937.</ref> The magazine's success stimulated many imitators, such as ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', which was founded a year later in 1937 and ran until 1971.

Luce moved ''Life'' into its own building at 19 West 31st Street, a [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] jewel built in 1894. It is considered a building of "outstanding significance" by the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission. Later ''Life'' moved its editorial offices to 9 [[Rockefeller Plaza]].

===Success===
Luce selected [[Edward Kramer Thompson]], a [[stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for ''Time'', as assistant picture editor in 1937. From 1949 to 1961 he was the managing editor, and served as editor-in-chief for nearly a decade, until his retirement in 1970. His influence was significant during the magazine's heyday, which was roughly from 1936 until the mid-1960s. Thompson was known for the free rein he gave his editors, particularly a "trio of formidable and colorful women: [[Sally Kirkland (editor)|Sally Kirkland]], fashion editor; [[Mary Letherbee]], movie editor; and [[Mary Hamman]], modern living editor."<ref>Dora Jane Hamblin, ''That Was the 'Life', '' New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1977, p. 161.</ref>

When the U.S. entered the war in 1941, so did ''Life''.  By 1944, of the 40 ''Time'' and ''Life'' war correspondents, seven were women: Americans [[Mary Welsh Hemingway]], [[Margaret Bourke-White]], [[Lael Tucker]], [[Peggy Durdin]], [[Shelley Smith Mydans]], [[Annalee Jacoby]], and Jacqueline Saix, an Englishwoman. (Saix's name is often omitted from the list, but she and Welsh are the only women listed as part of the magazine's team in a ''Times'''s publisher's letter, dated May 8, 1944.)<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Prentice|first=P.I.|date=8 May 1944|title=A Letter From The Publisher|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,933313,00.html|magazine=Time|page=11}}</ref>

''Life'' backed the war effort each week. In July 1942, ''Life'' launched its first art contest for soldiers and drew more than 1,500 entries, submitted by all ranks. Judges sorted out the best and awarded $1,000 in prizes.  ''Life'' picked 16 for reproduction in the magazine.  The [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. agreed to put 117 entries on exhibition that summer. ''Life'', in its patriotism, also supported the military's efforts to use artists to document the war. When Congress forbade the armed forces from using government money to fund artists in the field, ''Life'' privatized the programs, hiring many of the artists being let go by the Department of Defense (DOD). On December 7, 1960, ''Life'' managers later donated many of the works by such artists to the Department of Defense and its art programs, such as the [[United States Army Art Program]].<ref name="mcnoughten">{{cite book|author=Marian R.

Each week during [[World War II]], the magazine brought the war home to Americans; it had photographers in all theaters of war, from the Pacific to Europe.  The magazine was imitated in enemy [[propaganda]] using contrasting images of ''Life'' and ''Death''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Life and Death propaganda|url=http://www.psywar.org/product_NZAI-145-10-44-F.php|date=March 30, 2011|work=Psywar|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703153058/http://www.psywar.org/product_NZAI-145-10-44-F.php|archive-date=July 3, 2010|access-date=September 25, 2014}}</ref>

In August 1942, writing about labor and racial unrest in [[Detroit]], ''Life'' warned that "the morale situation is perhaps the worst in the U.S. ... It is time for the rest of the country to sit up and take notice. For Detroit can either blow up [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] or it can blow up the U.S."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v04EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15|title=Detroit is Dynamite|work=Life|date=August 17, 1942|access-date=November 20, 2011|page=15}}</ref> Mayor [[Edward Jeffries]] was outraged: "I'll match Detroit's patriotism against any other city's in the country. The whole story in ''LIFE'' is scurrilous ... I'd just call it a [[yellow journalism|yellow magazine]] and let it go at that."<ref>Mansfield (Ohio) ''News Journal'', August 17, 1942.</ref> The article was considered so dangerous to the war effort that it was [[Censorship in the United States#Wartime censorship|censored]] from copies of the magazine sold outside North America.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rU4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12|title=Letters to the Editor | work=Life | date=September 7, 1942|access-date=November 20, 2011|page=12}}</ref>

This and other graphic photos were given approval by the [[Office of War Information]]'s censors, in part because President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] feared that the American public was becoming complacent about the war.]] -->

The magazine hired [[Robert Capa]], the distinguished war photographer. A veteran of ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' magazine, Capa accompanied the first wave of the [[D-Day]] invasion in [[Normandy, France]], on June 6, 1944, and returned with only a handful of images, many of them out of focus. The magazine wrote in the captions that the photos were fuzzy because Capa's hands were shaking. He denied it, claiming that the darkroom had ruined his negatives. Later he poked fun at ''Life'' by titling his war memoir ''Slightly Out of Focus'' (1947). In 1954, Capa was killed after stepping on a [[landmine]], while working for the magazine covering the [[First Indochina War]]. ''Life'' photographer Bob Landry also went in with the first wave at D-Day, "but ''all'' of Landry's film was lost, and his shoes to boot."<ref>''The Great LIFE Photographers'', Thames and Hudson, paperback ed. 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-500-28836-8}}, p. 294</ref>

In a notable mistake, in its final edition just before the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 U.S. presidential election]] the magazine printed a large photo showing U.S. presidential candidate [[Thomas E. Dewey]] and his staff riding across [[San Francisco]], [[California]] harbor entitled "Our Next President Rides by Ferryboat over [[San Francisco Bay]]". Incumbent President [[Harry S. Truman]] won the election.<ref>Abels, Jules, ''Out of the Jaws of Victory'', New York: Henry Holt and Company (1959), p. 261.</ref>

On May 10, 1950, the council of ministers in [[Cairo]] banned ''Life'' from [[Egypt]] forever.  All issues on sale were confiscated. No reason was given, but Egyptian officials expressed indignation over the April 10, 1950, story about [[King Farouk]] of Egypt, entitled the "Problem King of Egypt". The government considered it insulting to the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Life magazine is banned in Egypt after publishing an unflattering article about King Farouk|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/life-magazine-banned-egypt-after-publishing-unflattering-article-about-king-farouk|work=South African History Online|access-date=November 27, 2013}}</ref>

''Life'' in the 1950s earned a measure of respect by commissioning work from top authors. After ''Life'''s publication in 1952 of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', the magazine contracted with the author for a 4,000-word piece on bullfighting.  Hemingway sent the editors a 10,000-word article, following his last visit to [[Spain]] in 1959 to cover a series of contests between two top [[Torero (bullfighter)|matadors]]. The article was republished in 1985 as the novella, ''[[The Dangerous Summer]]''.<ref>Michael Palin, "Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure", ''PBS'', 1999.</ref>

In February 1953, just a few weeks after leaving office, President [[Harry S. Truman]] announced that ''Life'' magazine would handle all rights to his memoirs.  Truman said it was his belief that by 1954 he would be able to speak more fully on subjects pertaining to the role his administration played in world affairs. Truman observed that ''Life'' editors had presented other memoirs with great dignity; he added that ''Life'' also made the best offer.

For his 1955 [[Museum of Modern Art]] travelling exhibition [[The Family of Man]], which was to be seen by 9 million visitors worldwide, curator [[Edward Steichen]] relied heavily on photographs from ''Life;'' 111 of the 503 pictures shown, constituting more than 20% as counted by [[Abigail Solomon-Godeau]].<ref>{{Citation | author1=Solomon-Godeau, Abigail | author2=Parsons, Sarah (Sarah Caitlin), 1971-, (editor.) | author3=ProQuest (Firm) | title=Photography after photography : gender, genre, and history | date=2017 | publisher=Duke University Press | isbn=978-0-8223-7362-9 }}</ref> His assistant [[Wayne F.

In November 1954, the actress [[Dorothy Dandridge]] was the first African-American woman to be featured on the cover of the magazine.

In 1957, [[R. Gordon Wasson]], a vice president at [[J. P. Morgan]], published an article in ''Life'' extolling the virtues of [[magic mushrooms]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Joaquim Tarinas|url=http://www.imaginaria.org/wasson/life.htm |title=ROBERT GORDON WASSON Seeking the Magic Mushroom|work=Imaginaria|access-date=January 15, 2012}}</ref> This prompted [[Albert Hofmann]] to isolate [[psilocybin]] in 1958 for distribution by [[Sandoz]] alongside [[LSD]] in the U.S., further raising interest in LSD in the mass media.<ref>{{cite news|date=June 16, 1958|title=Medicine: Mushroom Madness|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,863497,00.html|url-status=dead|access-date=May 7, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131160856/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,863497,00.html|archive-date=January 31, 2011}}</ref> Following Wasson's report, [[Timothy Leary]] visited Mexico to try out the mushrooms, which were used in traditional religious rituals.

In the post-war years, it published some of the most memorable images of events in the United States and the world.  It also produced many popular science serials, such as ''[[The World We Live In (Life magazine)|The World We Live In]]'' and ''The Epic of Man'' in the early 1950s. The magazine continued to showcase the work of notable illustrators, such as [[Alton S. Tobey]], whose many contributions included the cover for a 1958 series of articles on the history of the Russian Revolution.

However, as the 1950s drew to a close and TV became more popular, the magazine was losing readers. In May 1959 it announced plans to reduce its regular news-stand price from 25 cents a copy to 20. With the increase in television sales and viewership, interest in news magazines was waning. ''Life'' had to try to create a new form.

===1960s and the end of an era===
[[File:Henri Huet, LIFE cover, 110266.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Huet]]'s photograph of Thomas Cole featured on the cover of ''Life'', February 11, 1966]]

In the 1960s, the magazine was filled with color photos of movie stars, President [[John F. Kennedy]] and his family, the war in [[Vietnam]], and the [[Apollo program]]. Typical of the magazine's editorial focus was a long 1964 feature on actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and her relationship with actor [[Richard Burton]]. Journalist [[Richard Meryman]] traveled with Taylor to [[New York City]], [[California]], and [[Paris]]. ''Life'' ran a 6,000-word first-person article on the screen star.
<blockquote>"I'm not a 'sex queen' or a 'sex symbol,' " Taylor said. "I don't think I want to be one. Sex symbol kind of suggests bathrooms in hotels or something. I do know I'm a movie star and I like being a woman, and I think sex is absolutely gorgeous. But as far as a sex goddess, I don't worry myself that way... Richard is a very sexy man. He's got that sort of jungle essence that one can sense... When we look at each other, it's like our eyes have fingers and they grab ahold.... I think I ended up being the scarlet woman because of my rather puritanical upbringing and beliefs. I couldn't just have a romance. It had to be a marriage."<ref>"[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,830964,00.html Our Eyes Have Fingers]", ''Time'', December 25, 1964.</ref></blockquote>

In the 1960s, the magazine featured photographs by [[Gordon Parks]]. "The camera is my weapon against the things I dislike about the universe and how I show the beautiful things about the universe," Parks recalled in 2000. "I didn't care about Life magazine. I cared about the people," he said.<ref>''[[Rocky Mountain News|The Rocky Mountain News]]'', November 29, 2000, page 1.</ref>

The June 1964 Paul Welch ''Life'' article entitled "Homosexuality In America" was the first time a national publication reported on gay issues. ''Life'' 's photographer was referred to the gay [[leather subculture|leather]] bar in San Francisco called the Tool Box for the article by [[Hal Call]], who had long worked to dispel the myth that all homosexual men were effeminate. The article opened with a two-page spread of the mural of life size leathermen in the bar, which had been painted by [[Chuck Arnett]] in 1962.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2000/yax-192.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050120222835/http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2000/yax-192.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-01-20 |title=yax-192 Life in 1964, part 1 |publisher=Yawningbread.org |date=1964-07-27 |access-date=2012-05-18 }}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Folsom_Street:_The_Miracle_Mile|title=Folsom Street: The Miracle Mile|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|author-link=Gayle Rubin|date=1998|website=FoundSF|access-date=2016-12-28}}</ref> The article described San Francisco as "The Gay Capital of America" and inspired many gay leathermen to move there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leatherarchives.org/exhibits/deblase/timeline1.htm#1964 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421175041/http://www.leatherarchives.org/exhibits/deblase/timeline1.htm#1964 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-04-21 |title=Leather Archives & Museum Leather History Timeline |access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>

On March 25, 1966, ''Life'' featured the drug [[LSD]] as its cover story; it had attracted attention among the counter culture and was not yet criminalized.<ref>{{cite web|author=Life Magazine |url=http://www.psychedelic-library.org/magazines/lifelsd.htm |title=LSD - Cover |publisher=Psychedelic-library.org |access-date=2010-04-20}}</ref>

In March 1967, ''Life'' won the 1967 [[National Magazine Award]], chosen by the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]]. The prestigious award was made for the magazine's publication of stunning photos from the war in [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Henri Huet]]'s riveting series of a wounded medic that were published in January 1966. Increasingly, the photos that ''Life'' published of the war in Vietnam were searing images of death and loss.

Despite the industry's accolades and publishing America's [[List of missions to the Moon|mission to the moon]] in 1969, the magazine continued to lose circulation. Time Inc. announced in January 1971 its decision to reduce circulation from 8.5 million to 7 million in an effort to offset shrinking advertising revenues. Exactly one year later, ''Life'' cut its circulation from 7 million to 5.5 million beginning with the January 14, 1972, issue. ''Life'' was reportedly not losing money, but its costs were rising faster than its profits. ''Life'' lost credibility with many readers when it supported author [[Clifford Irving]], whose fraudulent autobiography of [[Howard Hughes]] was revealed as a [[hoax]] in January 1972. The magazine had purchased serialization rights to Irving's manuscript.

Industry figures showed that some 96% of ''Life'' circulation went to mail subscribers, with only 4% coming from the more profitable newsstand sales. Gary Valk was publisher when the magazine laid off hundreds of staff. The weekly ''Life'' magazine published its last issue on December 29, 1972.

From 1972 to 1978, Time Inc. published ten ''Life Special Reports'' on such themes as "The Spirit of Israel", "Remarkable American Women" and "The Year in Pictures". With a minimum of promotion, those issues sold between 500,000 and 1 million copies at cover prices of up to $2.

===As a monthly (1978–2000)===
Starting with the October 1978 issue, ''Life'' was published as a monthly, with a new, modified logo. Although still the familiar red rectangle with the white type, the new version was larger, and the lettering was closer together and the box surrounding it was smaller.

''Life'' continued for the next 22 years as a moderately successful general-interest, news features magazine. In 1986, it decided to mark its 50th anniversary under the Time Inc. umbrella with a special issue showing every ''Life'' cover starting from 1936, which included the issues published during the six-year hiatus in the 1970s. The circulation in this era hovered around the 1.5 million-circulation mark. The cover price in 1986 was $2.50 ({{Inflation|US|2.50|1986|r=2|fmt=eq}}). The publisher at the time was Charles Whittingham; the editor was [[Philip Kunhardt]]. In 1991 ''Life'' sent correspondents to the first [[Gulf War]] and published special issues of coverage. Four issues of this weekly, ''Life in Time of War'', were published during the first Gulf War.

The magazine struggled financially and, in February 1993, ''Life'' announced the magazine would be printed on smaller pages starting with its July issue. This issue also featured the return of the original ''Life'' logo.

''Life'' slashed advertising prices 34% in a bid to make the monthly publication more appealing to advertisers. The magazine reduced its circulation guarantee for advertisers by 12% in July 1993 to 1.5 million copies from the current 1.7 million. The publishers in this era were [[Nora McAniff]] and [[Edward McCarrick]]; [[Daniel Okrent]] was the editor. ''LIFE'' for the first time was the same trim size as its longtime Time Inc. sister publication, [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'']].

The magazine was back in the national consciousness upon the death in August 1995 of Alfred Eisenstaedt, the ''Life'' photographer whose photographs constitute some of the most enduring images of the 20th century. Eisenstaedt's photographs of the famous and infamous—[[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], the Kennedys, [[Sophia Loren]]—won him worldwide renown and 86 ''Life'' covers.

In 1999, the magazine was suffering financially, but still made news by compiling lists to round out the 20th century. ''Life'' editors ranked its "Most Important Events of the Millennium."  This list has been criticized for being overly focused on Western achievements. The [[History of China|Chinese]], for example, had invented type four centuries before [[Johannes Gutenberg]], but with thousands of [[ideograms]], found its use impractical. ''Life'' also published a list of the "100 Most Important People of the Millennium." This list, too, was criticized for focusing on the West. [[Thomas Edison]]'s number one ranking was challenged since critics believed other inventions, such as the [[Internal combustion engine]], the automobile, and electricity-making machines, for example, had greater effects on society than Edison's. The top 100 list was criticized for mixing world-famous names, such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Louis Pasteur]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], with numerous Americans largely unknown outside of the United States (18 Americans compared to 13 Italian and French, and 11 English).

In March 2000, Time Inc. announced it would cease regular publication of ''Life'' with the May issue.
<blockquote>"It's a sad day for us here," [[Don Logan]], chairman and chief executive of Time Inc., told CNNfn.com. "It was still in the black," he said, noting that ''LIFE'' was increasingly spending more to maintain its monthly circulation level of approximately 1.5 million. "Life was a general interest magazine and since its reincarnation, it had always struggled to find its identity, to find its position in the marketplace," Logan said.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/17/bizbuzz/life/|title=Time Inc. to cease publication of Life magazine|date=March 17, 2000|work=[[CNN]]}}</ref></blockquote>The magazine's last issue featured a human interest story. In 1936, its first issue under Henry Luce featured a baby named [[George Story (journalist)|George Story]], with the headline "Life Begins"; over the years the magazine had published updates about the course of Story's life as he married, had children, and pursued a career as a journalist. After Time announced its pending closure in March, George Story happened to die of heart failure on April 4, 2000. The last issue of LIFE was titled "A Life Ends", featuring his story and how it had intertwined with the magazine over the years.<ref name="Sumner2010">{{cite book|author=David E. Sumner|title=The Magazine Century: American Magazines Since 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7g9PgL_No0C&pg=PA89|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-1-4331-0493-0|pages=89–}}</ref>

For ''Life'' subscribers, remaining subscriptions were honored with other Time Inc. magazines, such as ''Time''. In January 2001, these subscribers received a special, ''Life''-sized format of "The Year in Pictures" edition of ''Time'' magazine. It was a ''Life'' issue disguised under a ''Time'' logo on the front. (Newsstand copies of this edition were published under the ''Life'' imprint.)

While citing poor advertising sales and a rough climate for selling magazine subscriptions, Time Inc. executives said a key reason for closing the title in 2000 was to divert resources to the company's other magazine launches that year, such as ''[[Real Simple]]''. Later that year, its parent company, [[Time Warner]], struck a deal with the [[Tribune Company]] for [[Times Mirror]] magazines, which included ''Golf, Ski, Skiing, Field & Stream'', and ''Yachting''. [[AOL]] and [[Time Warner]] announced a $184 billion merger, the largest corporate merger in history, which was finalized in January 2001.<ref>{{cite web | title=Who Owns What: Time Warner Corporate Timeline | website=cjr.org | date=2006-08-18 | url=http://www.cjr.org/_deprecate/timewarner-timeline.asp | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818051718/http://www.cjr.org/_deprecate/timewarner-timeline.asp | archive-date=2006-08-18 | url-status=dead | access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>

In 2001, Time Warner began publishing special newsstand "megazine" issues of ''Life'', on topics such as the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and the [[Holy Land]]. These issues, which were printed on thicker paper, were more like softcover books than magazines.

===Supplement (2004–2007)===
Beginning in October 2004, ''Life'' was revived for a second time. It resumed weekly publication as a free supplement to U.S. newspapers, competing for the first time with the two industry heavyweights, ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' and ''[[USA Weekend]]''. At its launch, it was distributed with more than 60 newspapers with a combined circulation of approximately 12 million. Among the newspapers to carry ''Life'' were the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', ''[[New York Daily News]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[The Denver Post|Denver Post]]'', and ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''. Time Inc. made deals with several major newspaper publishers to carry the ''Life'' supplement, including [[Knight Ridder]] and [[the McClatchy Company]]. The launch of ''LIFE'' as a weekly newspaper supplement was conceived by [[Andrew Blau]], who served as the President of ''Life''. [[Bill Shapiro]] was the Founding Editor of the weekly supplement.

This version of ''Life'' retained its trademark logo but sported a new cover motto, "America's Weekend Magazine." It measured 9½ x 11½ inches and was printed on glossy paper in full-color. On September 15, 2006, ''Life'' was 19 pages of editorial content. The editorial content contained one full-page photo, of actress [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], and one three-page, seven-photo essay, of [[Kaiju Big Battel]]. On March 24, 2007, Time Inc. announced that it would fold the magazine as of April 20, 2007, although it would keep the web site.<ref name="timetoclose" /><ref name="usatoday" />

==Special issues==
''Life'' appears in special issues on notable occasions, such as ''[[Bob Dylan]]'' on the occasion of his winning the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], in 2016, and ''[[Paul McCartney|Paul]] at 75'', in 2017; ''Life'' is now published by [[Meredith Corporation]], for instance, ''"Life" Explores:  The Roaring '20s'' in 2020.<ref>''"Life" Explores: The Roaring '20s:  The Decade that Changed America'' (2020), New York:  Meredith.</ref>

==Partnership with Google==
On November 18, 2008, [[Google]] began hosting an archive of the magazine's photographs, as part of a joint effort with ''Life''.<ref name="google">{{cite news|author=Ewen MacAskill in Washington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/18/google-life-magazine-photographs-images |title=Google makes LIFE magazine photo archives available to the public |newspaper=Guardian |date= November 18, 2008|access-date=2012-01-15}}</ref> Many images in this archive had never been published in the magazine.<ref>{{cite news |title=Google gives online life to Life mag's photos |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hpwZcZap0g13zNOf8SxhiGlxYYCQD94I7JBO0 |quote=Google Inc. has opened an online photo gallery that will include millions of images from Life magazine's archives that have never been seen by the public before. |agency=Associated Press |date=2008-11-19 |access-date=2008-11-19 }}</ref> The archive of over 6 million photographs from ''Life'' is also available through [[Google Cultural Institute]], allowing for users to create collections, and is accessible through [[Google image search]].

The standalone Life.com site was launched March 31, 2009 and closed January 30, 2012. Life.com was developed by Andrew Blau and Bill Shapiro, the same team who launched the weekly newspaper supplement. While the archive of ''Life'', known as the LIFE Picture Collection, was substantial, they searched for a partner who could provide significant contemporary photography. They approached [[Getty Images]], the world's largest licensor of photography. The site, a joint venture between [[Getty Images]] and ''Life'' magazine, offered millions of photographs from their combined collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.life.com |title=Life.com |publisher=Life.com |access-date=2012-01-15}}</ref> On the 50th anniversary of the night [[Marilyn Monroe]] sang "[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]" to [[John F. Kennedy]], Life.com presented Bill Ray's iconic portrait of the actress, along with other rare photos.

'''2013 movie release'''

The film, ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'' (2013), starring [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Kristen Wiig]], portrays ''Life'' as it transitioned from printed material toward having only an online presence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waltermitty.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006043411/http://www.waltermitty.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-10-06 |title=The Secret Life of Walter Mitty |publisher=waltermitty.com |date=2013-06-28 |access-date=2013-12-29 }}</ref> Life.com later became a redirect to a small photo channel on Time.com.
