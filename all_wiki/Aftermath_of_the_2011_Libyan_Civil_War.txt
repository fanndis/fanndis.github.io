[[File:Seal of the National Transitional Council (Libya).svg|thumb|Seal of the National Transitional Council]]
The '''aftermath of the First Libyan Civil War''' has been characterized by marked change in the social and political order of [[Libya]] after the overthrow and [[Killing of Muammar Gaddafi|killing]] of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|civil war that was fought in Libya]] in 2011. The country has been subject to ongoing proliferation of weapons, Islamic insurgencies, sectarian violence, and lawlessness, with spillovers affecting neighboring countries including [[Mali]].

After the interim [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) declared that the country had been liberated in October 2011, it began a process to form a new government, prepare for elections and prosecute former Gaddafi officials. In the absence of an organized military, armed militias of former rebels continued to assert their role as "guardians of the revolution" around the country, and there were reports of vigilante justice and sporadic clashes between rival militias. International organizations voiced concerns over the proliferation of weapons in the region, and the risk that they might fall into the hands of militant [[Islamist]]s.

[[Libyan General National Congress election, 2012|Elections]] were held in July 2012 to a [[General National Congress]] (GNC), which took power a month later, charged with organising a [[constituent assembly]] for authoring Libya's new constitution. The NTC was formally dissolved, and in November 2012 [[Ali Zeidan]] was sworn in as Prime Minister. In March 2014, Zeidan was ousted by the GNC, amid [[2014 Libyan conflict|escalating conflict in the country]]. On 4 August 2014, the GNC was replaced by a newly elected [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]] (CoD), but on 25 August 2014, some members of the former GNC reconvened unilaterally and said they had elected [[Omar al-Hasi]] as Prime Minister, effectively leaving the country with two rival governments: the one proclaimed by the CoD in [[Tobruk]] and the one proclaimed by the [[General National Congress (2014)|claimant GNC]] in [[Tripoli]].

The popular uprising against the government of Gaddafi began in January 2011 as non-violent protests, simultaneously with other protests in the [[Arab Spring]]. Within weeks, violence broke out in clashes between police and protesters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Libyans Protest over Delayed Subsidized Housing Units|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/297407|date=16 January 2011|work=Egypt Independent|accessdate=18 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322055904/http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/297407|archive-date=22 March 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Libya Protest over Housing Enters Its Third Day|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/4032/World/Region/Libya-protest-over-housing-enters-its-third-day.aspx|last=Abdel-Baky|first=Mohamed|date=16 January 2011|work=[[Al-Ahram]]|accessdate=25 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227093706/http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/4032/World/Region/Libya-protest-over-housing-enters-its-third-day.aspx|archive-date=27 December 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In February, the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) was formed in an effort to consolidate efforts for change in the rule of Libya.<ref name=NTCform>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/28/us-libya-protests-idUSTRE71G0A620110228|title=World raises pressure on Libya, battles for key towns|agency=Reuters|last=Golovnina|first=Maria|date=28 February 2011|accessdate=25 January 2012|location=Tripoli|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121004853/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/28/us-libya-protests-idUSTRE71G0A620110228|archive-date=21 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Gaddafi forces lost control of several cities in eastern Libya,<ref name=NTCform/> and a number of officials resigned or defected from his government.<ref name="BBCNews-pressure">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12550719|title=Pressure Mounts on Isolated Gaddafi|work=BBC News|date=23 February 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316074222/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12550719|archive-date=16 March 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In March, Gaddafi forces launched a counteroffensive, and regained many of the cities that had been lost to opposition forces.<ref>{{cite news|date=19 March 2011|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/03/201131934914112208.html|title=Gaddafi Forces Encroaching on Benghazi|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=27 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531194927/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/03/201131934914112208.html|archive-date=31 May 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In mid-March, tanks of Gaddafi forces rolled into the main remaining bastion of the opposition forces, [[Benghazi]].<ref>{{cite news|date=19 March 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12793919|title=Libya: Gaddafi Forces Attacking Rebel-Held Benghazi|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172346/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12793919|archive-date=19 March 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> At the same time, aircraft of the [[French Air Force]] entered Libyan airspace under the mandate of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]], to prevent any attacks on the city.<ref name=aljazcommand>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/africa/libya-live-blog-march-19 |title=Libya Live Blog – March&nbsp;19 |access-date=19 March 2011 |date=19 March 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320235930/http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/africa/libya-live-blog-march-19 |archive-date=20 March 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}</ref> A multinational coalition launched a large scale air-based [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention]] to disable the Gaddafi government's military capabilities and enforce the UN Security Council resolution.<ref name=aljazcommand/> By the end of March, command of the coalition operations had been assumed by [[NATO]] under [[Operation Unified Protector]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/deal-puts-nato-at-head-of-libyan-operation/story-e6frg6so-1226027088954|title=Deal Puts NATO at Head of Libyan Operation|work=The Australian|last=Norington|first=Brad|date=23 March 2011|accessdate=23 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422191917/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/deal-puts-nato-at-head-of-libyan-operation/story-e6frg6so-1226027088954|archive-date=22 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Formation of a government ===

=== First public elections ===
On 1 January 2012, the NTC released a 15-page draft law that would regulate the election of a national assembly charged with writing a new constitution and forming a second caretaker government. The proposed law laid out more than 20 classes of people who would be prohibited from standing as candidates in the elections, including Libyans who had ties to Muammar Gaddafi, former officials accused of torturing Libyans or embezzling public funds, active members of the Revolutionary Guard, opposition members who made peace with Gaddafi and academics who wrote about Gaddafi's [[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]].<ref name="nolinkelections">{{cite news | url=https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE8010H920120102 | title=Libyans linked to Gaddafi can't run in election - draft | agency=Reuters Africa | date=2 January 2012 | accessdate=5 January 2012 | location=Tripoli | first=Mahmoud | last=Habboush | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124031415/http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE8010H920120102 | archive-date=24 January 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> The draft bill also stipulated that 10% of the 200 seats in the constituent assembly would be reserved for women.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2012/01/21/libyans-storm-transitional-govt-hq-in-benghazi/ | title=Libyans Storm Transitional Govt.

The Forum of National Parties, an association of 12 moderate Islamist parties, said it rejected the proposed election law because it encouraged voting along tribal lines and gave undue influence to the wealthy. According to [[Wasila al-Ashiq]], head of one of the parties represented in the organization, candidates would have to run as independents under the proposed law because Libya has no law regulating political parties. That would mean that those candidates capable of drawing on tribal power and affiliation would win the seats, she said, while minorities such as the [[Berber people|Berbers]] would be ignored.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL6E8CF09420120115|title=Libyan parties reject draft election law|date=15 January 2012|accessdate=17 January 2012|location=Tripoli|agency=Reuters Africa|first1=Taha|last1=Zargoun|first2=Oliver|last2=Holmes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125745/http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL6E8CF09420120115|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 28 January 2012, the NTC announced it had adopted a revised version of the electoral bill as law. The proposed 10 percent quota for female members of the constituent assembly was dropped; instead, the law required political parties to have equal numbers of men and women in their candidate lists. Furthermore, the law called for two-thirds of the 200 seats in the constituent assembly - the so-called General National Congress - to go to candidates of political parties, while the remaining seats would be held by independents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gN5_8HWi3dScd2EJPyumFIQH8ttw?docId=CNG.4ffac2cc40606474bc6242c7407d8a26.e1|title=Libya's NTC adopts election law, drops women quota|date=28 January 2012|accessdate=29 January 2012|location=Tripoli|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Google News|first1=Imed|last1=Lamloum|archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org:80/web/20120531075158/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gN5_8HWi3dScd2EJPyumFIQH8ttw?docId=CNG.4ffac2cc40606474bc6242c7407d8a26.e1|archive-date=31 May 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

A new law governing the formation of political organisations was passed on by the NTC on 24 April. Political parties based on regional, tribal or religious affiliation were prohibited. Furthermore, parties cannot be an extension of a political party abroad or receive foreign funding.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCTuRbVtfd1O3_vRYxrkF9amsFcg?docId=CNG.a667c2f5c2ae88920e6404e109ae6992.c71|title=Religion-based parties banned under new Libya law|date=24 April 2012|accessdate=25 April 2012|location=Tripoli|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Google News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/25/us-libya-election-idUSBRE83O0Y620120425|title=Libya bans religious, tribal or ethnic parties|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=26 April 2012|location=Tripoli|agency=Reuters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425182443/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/25/us-libya-election-idUSBRE83O0Y620120425|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 7 July 2012, Libyans voted in their first parliamentary elections since the end of the rule of Muammar Gaddafi. The election, in which more than 100 political parties had registered, formed an interim 200-member national assembly. The purpose of this assembly was to replace the unelected NTC, name a Prime Minister, and form a committee to draft a constitution. The vote was postponed several times to resolve logistical and technical problems, and to give more time to register to vote, and to vetting candidates.<ref>{{cite news|last=Epatko|first=Larisa|title=In Libya, Expectations High as Parliamentary Vote Approaches|publisher=PBS NewsHour}}</ref>

Fifteen other parties won one party list seat each. On 8 August 2012, the [[General National Congress]] replaced NTC.

=== Prosecution of Gaddafi officials ===
[[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], his father's ''heir apparent'', was captured near the town of [[Ubari]] in the [[Idehan Ubari]] by [[Zintan]]i militiamen on 19 November 2011. His capture was confirmed by the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), which had issued an arrest warrant for Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and his father during the war. The military council in Zintan said it would hold the Gaddafi son in Zintan until [[Abdurrahim El-Keib]], the incoming Prime Minister of Libya, formed a government it considered capable of taking custody of the high-ranking prisoner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/20111119111936535209.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=Saif al-Islam Gaddafi arrested in Libya|date=19 November 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122001901/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/20111119111936535209.html|archive-date=22 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

If militias had not withdrawn by 20 December 2011, the authorities and members of the public intended to close the whole city to traffic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E7N64R920111206|title=Libyan government promises to disarm Tripoli|agency=Reuters Africa|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|location=Tripoli|first1=Taha|last1=Zargoun|first2=Ali|last2=Shuaib|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202120821/http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E7N64R920111206|archive-date=2 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> By January 2012, the former rebels had dismantled most of their checkpoints, while some key bases still remained.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2012/01/2012156215196506.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=8 January 2012|accessdate=14 January 2012|title=Can Libya's armed groups be disbanded?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112041654/http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2012/01/2012156215196506.html|archive-date=12 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Proliferation of weapons ===
On 31 October 2011, the [[United Nations Security Council]] expressed concern over the proliferation of weapons from Gaddafi's stockpiles, worrying they could fall into the hands of [[al-Qaeda]] and other militant groups.

A report by the [[United Nations Support Mission in Libya]] said that Gaddafi's government had accumulated a large stockpile of [[MANPAD]]s, and that although thousands were destroyed during the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]], there were "increasing concerns over the looting and likely proliferation of these portable defence systems, as well as munitions and mines, highlighting the potential risk to local and regional stability."<ref name="UNleak"/>

[[Ali al-Sallabi]], an Islamist cleric, who lived in [[Doha]] for four years, was a key conduit for weapons, vehicles and funds from Qatar to the Libyan rebels during the civil war. Rebel commanders outside of Sallabi's circle openly complained that they lacked weapons and medical supplies, leading NTC's head of government, [[Mahmoud Jibril]], to send an envoy to Doha to lobby for weapons and supplies to be sent through him. But of the 18 plane loads from Qatar, only five were sent through this NTC-approved channel. This led NTC and Western officials to raise concerns that the Qatari seemed to be aiding primarily Islamist leaders at the expense of the NTC.<ref>{{cite news|title=Libya’s former PM accuses Qatar of seeking too big a role|agency=Reuters|location=Dubai|date=11 November 2011|accessdate=25 January 2012|work=Lebanon Daily Star|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2011/Nov-11/153684-libyas-former-pm-accuses-qatar-of-seeking-too-big-a-role.ashx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113224302/http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2011/Nov-11/153684-libyas-former-pm-accuses-qatar-of-seeking-too-big-a-role.ashx#axzz1kUdyRACN|archive-date=13 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Sallabi, who is well known as an Islamic scholar and orator in Libya, announced the formation of a party based on Islamic principles.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/world/africa/in-libya-islamists-growing-sway-raises-questions.html|title=Islamists' Growing Sway Raises Questions for Libya|work=The New York Times|first1=Rod|last1=Nordland|first2=David D.|last2=Kirkpatrick|location=Tripoli|date=14 September 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124192447/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/world/africa/in-libya-islamists-growing-sway-raises-questions.html|archive-date=24 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/Libyan+exile+unveils+party+plan+liberal+Islamic+state/5683190/story.html |title=Libyan exile unveils new party's plan for 'liberal' Islamic state |first=Richard |last=Spencer |date=9 November 2011 |access-date=16 November 2011 |work=The Vancouver Sun|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110032159/http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Libyan%2Bexile%2Bunveils%2Bparty%2Bplan%2Bliberal%2BIslamic%2Bstate/5683190/story.html |archive-date=10 November 2011}}</ref> The [[Justice and Development Party (Libya)|Freedom and Justice Party]] was also founded on such principles.

In the months following the Libyan uprising, the [[Sahel]] region saw thousands of combatants originating from [[Mali]] and [[Niger]], mostly ethnic [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] who supported either Gaddafi or the NTC, returning from Libya to their respective countries with a wide range of weapons. Mali's [[defence minister]], Natie Plea, said that the risk of organizations such as [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] (AQIM) seizing the arsenal for terrorist purposes was "a real source of concern" for countries in the desert sub-region.

=== Public protests ===
By December 2011, the NTC were facing protests in [[Benghazi]] over the pace of reforms and lack of transparency in the new Libyan government. Protesters were criticizing the NTC and its chairman [[Mustafa Abdul Jalil]] and demanding that former Gaddafi supporters would be excluded from governing posts in the new Libyan state. Jalil called for patience and promised that personal details and official information of all government officials would be published publicly on the Internet in time.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://dw.de/dw/article/0,,15600388,00.html | title=Frustration threatens to unleash second Libyan revolution | publisher=Deutsche Welle | date=16 December 2011 | accessdate=5 January 2012 | first=Monika | last=Dittrich | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206030633/http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15600388,00.html | archive-date=6 February 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref>

On 21 January 2012, hundreds of protesters, including many young men wounded from the civil war, stormed the NTC's headquarters in Benghazi, protesting the speed of reforms and lack of transparency from the interim government. When the head of the NTC, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, appeared to address the crowd, the protesters began throwing empty plastic bottles at him, prompting security forces to fire tear gas. Before storming the headquarters, protesters threw stones and metal bars at the building, breaking its windows.

=== Ethnic and tribal reconciliation ===
During the civil war, many [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] nomad tribes in southern Libya supported Gaddafi because of his past support of their people's rebellions in Mali and Niger. This led to tensions between Tuareg and Arab Libyans, and in the aftermath of the war, the NTC sent out delegations to mediate disputes and reconcile the region with the interim government.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-libya-tuareg-idUSTRE7A82S020111109|title=Tense reconciliation begins with Libya's Saharan tribes|first=Oliver|last=Holmes|location=Obari|date=9 November 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|agency=Reuters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112105711/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-libya-tuareg-idUSTRE7A82S020111109|archive-date=12 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The tribes, who roam Libya's vast desert expanses, are important to security in the region's remote areas, which are often exploited as a safe haven by drug traffickers and Islamist militants.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/30/libya-talks-idUSL5E7KU1SZ20110930|title=Libya officer at Tuareg-Arab talks in desert town|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|agency=Reuters|first=William|last=Maclean|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102071403/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/30/libya-talks-idUSL5E7KU1SZ20110930|archive-date=2 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Fathi Ben Khalifa, president of the [[World Amazigh Congress]], criticized the NTC for not formally recognizing the [[Berber people]], saying that his people is experiencing a "déjà vu feeling", as Libya's rulers also failed to recognize the Berbers when the country [[Libya#Independence and the Kingdom of Libya 1951–1969|gained its independence]] in 1951, making way for Gaddafi's policies of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Khalifa claims that the NTC is adhering to "Arab and Islamist" ideologies that caused "much of what has happened in [Libya] for the last decades", and that the council envisions the new Libya being rooted in an exclusively [[Islam]]ic constitution. According to Khalifa, "no [Berber] will accept this situation".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15515687,00.html|title=Libya's Berbers feel rejected by transitional government|date=8 November 2011|first=Karlos|last=Zurutuza|location=Tripoli|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=16 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115024312/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15515687,00.html|archive-date=15 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 17 November 2011, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] held its first public conference on Libyan soil in [[Benghazi]] after having been banned for decades under Gaddafi's government. Suleiman Abdelkader, leader of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, said that rebuilding the country "is not a task for one group or one party but for everyone, based on their ability." He also said his organization would not take part in the interim government.<ref>{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Francois|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/17/us-libya-muslim-brotherhood-idUSTRE7AG2OY20111117|title=Muslim Brotherhood goes public with Libya summit|agency=Reuters|date=17 November 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108142418/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/17/us-libya-muslim-brotherhood-idUSTRE7AG2OY20111117|archive-date=8 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 9 January 2012, a group of Libyan Muslim scholars announced the formation of a new Islamist party by the name [[Party of Reform and Development]]. A statement from the group said the party was an "Islamist party committed to the principles of Islamic [[sharia]]",<ref name=islamistparty/> aiming to work for establishing a state based on institutions. The chairman of the party, Khaled al-Wershefani, said the group aimed "to focus on national unity and build a Libyan state which is modern, civilized and developed and which does not exclude or marginalize anyone."<ref name=islamistparty/> He added that the party would refuse to deal with any group which "contradicts sharia," referring to the secular and liberal factions in Libya.<ref name=islamistparty>{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/first-islamist-party-emerges-in-libya.aspx?pageID=238&nID=11203&NewsCatID=357|title=First Islamist party emerges in Libya|work=Hürriyet Daily News|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=25 January 2012|agency=Agence France-Presse|location=Tripoli|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927163539/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/first-islamist-party-emerges-in-libya.aspx?pageID=238&nID=11203&NewsCatID=357|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Legislation ===
The National Transitional Council adopted laws in early May 2012 granting immunity to former rebel fighters for acts committed during the civil war, confiscating all former regime assets, criminalising "praising or glorifying" [[Muammar Gaddafi]] or his regime, and barring criticism of the revolution or the authority of the Libyan government. It also decreed that detained fighters must be charged and tried by 12 July 2012 or else released. It was not immediately clear whether the laws would govern the transitional period only or would else be permanent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/05/03/211978.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|title=Libya grants immunity to 'revolutionaries'|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=6 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114040808/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/05/03/211978.html|archive-date=14 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Law 37, which prohibits criticism of the revolution and publication of "propaganda", including vocal support for Gaddafi's family or the ideas of the ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|Green Book]]'', is reportedly based on provisions of the Gaddafi-era penal code banning criticism of the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Coup d.27.C3.A9tat of 1969|1969 coup]] that brought Gaddafi to power.

On 29 December 2011, Libya's [[National Oil Corporation]] (NOC) announced that the country's output of [[crude oil]] had risen to over 1 million [[barrels per day]] (bpd), compared to 1.6 million bpd before the uprising.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&i=7577 |title=Libya Oil Production Reaches 1m BPD, Expects Full Output by Mid-2012 |work=Tripoli Post |date=29 December 2011 |access-date=14 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502020344/http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&i=7577 |archive-date=2 May 2014}}</ref> Libya's biggest oil terminal, Es Sider, resumed operations as of January 2012<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/libyas-es-sider-oil-port-resumes-exports-2012-01-03|title=Libya's Es-Sider oil port resumes exports|date=3 January 2012|accessdate=14 January 2012|work=Market Watch|first=Benoit|last=Faucon|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112120434/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/libyas-es-sider-oil-port-resumes-exports-2012-01-03|archive-date=12 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> but may take more than a year to be fully repaired.<ref name="oil">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/28/us-timeline-oil-idUSTRE79R33N20111028|title=Factbox: Libya's oil returns; fields, refineries, companies|agency=Reuters|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|location=Tripoli|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211144812/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/28/us-timeline-oil-idUSTRE79R33N20111028|archive-date=11 December 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

NOC has said that local crude and product needs are given priority. Of Libya's total crude distillation capacity of 378,000 bpd, the country's five domestic refineries are refining 160,000 bpd of current production. Libya's largest refinery, [[Ra's Lanuf Refinery]], is expected to remain offline until the end of the year.<ref name="oil"/>

The [[International Energy Agency]] said the bulk of repairs to oil infrastructure had been undertaken by local petroleum industry staff, but many of the repairs would have to be performed by foreign specialists working for the international oil companies. Most oil companies have deployed small teams to restart production. NOC said it had taken over full control of marketing Libyan oil, which split during the civil war, and that all future deals would give preference to actors who had shown early support during the uprising.<ref name="oil"/>

The Libyan interior ministry reported on 3 May 2012 that the oil fields were operating in a normal fashion and the production was good. He added that the production of oil had reached 1.55 million barrels per day the previous week, almost pre-war levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.libyaherald.com/2012/05/03/libya-seeks-extradition-of-bashir-salah-from-france/|title=Libya seeks extradition of Bashir Salah from France|access-date=2 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616053344/https://www.libyaherald.com/2012/05/03/libya-seeks-extradition-of-bashir-salah-from-france/|archive-date=16 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> However, by September 2013, armed groups were blockading oilfields, cutting production to about 100,000 barrels per day, leading to some fuel shortages and blackouts.

=== Public funds ===
At the beginning of the civil war, the [[UN Security Council]] froze an estimated $150 billion in foreign Libyan assets.
