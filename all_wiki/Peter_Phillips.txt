Phillips was [[line of succession to the British Throne|fifth in line to the throne]] at birth and remained so until the birth of his cousin [[Prince William]] in 1982.

Kelly, who was raised in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], was received into the [[Church of England]] before her marriage.
