The '''Order of Merit''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Ordre du Mérite}}){{#tag:ref|For use in Canada, in accordance with [[official bilingualism in Canada|the country's policy of official bilingualism]].|group=n|name=Lingo}} is a Commonwealth [[order of merit]] recognising distinguished service in the armed forces, science, art, literature, or for the promotion of culture. Established in 1902 by King [[Edward VII]], admission into the order remains the personal gift of its Sovereign—currently Edward VII's great-granddaughter, Queen [[Elizabeth II]]—and is restricted to a maximum of 24 living recipients from the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, plus a limited number of honorary members.<ref name=RHOM>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/OrderofMerit.aspx| publisher=Royal Household| title=Order of Merit |access-date=28 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718173106/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/OrderofMerit.aspx|archive-date=18 July 2009}}</ref><ref name="gg.ca">{{cite web|last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| author-link=Governor General of Canada |url=https://www.gg.ca/en/honours/canadian-honours/directory-honours/order-merit |title=Order of Merit |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |access-date=10 June 2019| date=19 April 2017 }}</ref> While all members are awarded the right to use the [[post-nominal letters]] ''OM'' and wear the badge of the order,<ref name="Jackson">{{Citation|first=Michael D.|last=Jackson|title=The Order of Merit 1902–2002: One Hundred Years of Matchless Honour by Stanley Martin, CD|url=http://www.monarchist.ca/files/publications/CMNsummer2007.pdf|issue=26|page=15|date=Summer 2007|type=Book review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708040312/http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2007/Summer_2007_CMN.pdf|periodical=Canadian Monarchist News / Les Nouvelles Monarchiques du Canada|location=Oakville, Ontario|publisher=Monarchist League of Canada / La Ligue Monarchiste du Canada|access-date=2019-06-10|archive-date=8 July 2009}}</ref> the Order of Merit's precedence among other honours differs between countries.

==History==
The first mention of a possible Order of Merit was made following the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805, in correspondence between [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham|Lord Barham]] and [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], though nothing came of the idea.<ref name=Martin11>{{Harvnb| Martin| 2007| p=11}}</ref> Later, it was thought by [[Queen Victoria]], her courtiers, and politicians alike,<ref>{{Harvnb| Martin| 2007| p=12}}</ref> that a new order, based on the [[Prussia]]n order ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'', would make up for the insufficient recognition offered by the established [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours system]] to achievement outside of public service, in fields such as art, music, literature, industry, and science.<ref name=Martin11/>

Victoria's husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort]], took an interest in the matter; it was recorded in his diary that he met [[Robert Peel]] on 16 January 1844 to discuss the "idea of institution of a civil Order of Merit" and, three days later, he conferred with the Queen on the subject.<ref>{{Harvnb| Martin| 2007| p=13}}</ref> The concept did not wither and, on 5 January 1888, British prime minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] submitted to the Queen a draft constitution for an Order of Merit in Science and Art, consisting of one grade split into two branches of knighthood: the Order of Scientific Merit for Knights of Merit in Science, with the post-nominal letters ''KMS'', and the Order of Artistic Merit for Knights of Merit in Art, with the post-nominal letters ''KMA''. However, [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Sir Frederic Leighton]], [[Royal Academy#Presidents|President of the Royal Academy]], advised against the new order, primarily because of its selection process.<ref>{{Harvnb| Martin| 2007| pp=18–20}}</ref>
[[File:Eduard VII.jpg|thumb|upright|left|King [[Edward VII]], founder of the Order of Merit]]

Victoria's son, King [[Edward VII]], eventually founded the Order of Merit on 26 June 1902 (the date for which his coronation had been originally planned<ref>{{Harvnb| Martin| 2007| p=1}}</ref>) as a means to acknowledge "exceptionally meritorious service in Our Navy and Our Army, or who may have rendered exceptionally meritorious service towards the advancement of Art, Literature and Science".<ref>{{Citation| last=Mountbatten| first=Philip| author-link=Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh| date=2007| contribution=Foreword| contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWVscq9SdgYC| editor-last=Martin| editor-first=Stanley| title=The Order of Merit: One Hundred Years of Matchless Honour| pages=xvii| place=London| publication-place=New York| publisher=I.B. Tauris & Co. Ltd.| isbn=978-1-86064-848-9}}</ref> All modern aspects of the order were established under his direction, including the division for military figures.<ref name=Jackson/>

From the outset, prime ministers attempted to propose candidates or lobbied to influence the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]]'s decision on appointments, but the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]] adamantly guarded information about potential names.<ref name=Jackson/> After 1931, when the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] came into being and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]] became independent countries, equal in status to the UK, the Order of Merit continued as an honour open to all these realms and, in many, became a part of their national honours systems.<ref>{{cite book| last=McCreery| first=Christopher| author-link=Christopher McCreery| title=The Canadian Honours System| page=98| publisher=Dundurn Press| location=Toronto| year=2005| isbn=9781550025545}}</ref> The order's statutes were amended in 1935 to include members of the [[Royal Air Force]] and, in 1969, the definition of honorary recipients was expanded to include members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that are not realms.

From its inception, the order has been open to women, [[Florence Nightingale]] being the first woman to receive the honour, in 1907. Several individuals have refused admission into the Order of Merit, including [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[A. E. Housman]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. To date, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], remains the youngest person ever inducted into the Order of Merit, having been admitted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1968, when he was 47 years of age.<ref name=Jackson/>

==Eligibility and appointment==
[[File:Order of Merit in Westminster Cathedral (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|Reverse of the badge]]
All citizens of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s are eligible for appointment to the Order of Merit.<ref name="gg.ca"/> There may be, however, only 24 living individuals in the order at any given time, not including honorary appointees, and new members are personally selected by the reigning monarch of the realms, currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]], with the assistance of her private secretaries;<ref name=Jackson/> the order has thus been described as "quite possibly, the most prestigious honour one can receive on planet Earth."<ref>{{Citation| last=Editorial Board| title=Order Worthy?| newspaper=National Post| date=15 July 2009| url=https://nationalpost.com/story.html?id=1791001| access-date=29 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} [https://www.pressreader.com/canada/national-post-latest-edition/20090715/281917359074501 Alt URL]</ref> Within the limited membership is a designated military division, with its own unique insignia; though it has not been abolished, it is currently unpopulated, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]] having been the last person so honoured.<ref name=Jackson/> Honorary members form another group, to which there is no numerical limit, though such appointments are rare; individuals from countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that are not headed by Elizabeth II are therefore considered foreigners, and thus are granted only honorary admissions, such as [[Nelson Mandela]] (South Africa) and [[Mother Teresa]] (India).<ref name=RHOM/>

Upon admission into the Order of Merit, members are entitled to use the [[post-nominal letters]] ''OM'' and are entrusted with the badge of the order, consisting of a golden crown from which is suspended a red enamelled cross, itself centred by a disk of blue enamel, surrounded by a [[laurel wreath]], and bearing in gold lettering the words ''FOR MERIT'';<ref name=PoW>{{cite web| url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/forchildren/medalsanduniforms/medals/index.html| publisher=Clarence House| title=For Children > Medals and Uniforms > Medals > Picture 4: The Order of Merit | access-date=29 July 2009}}</ref> the insignia for the military grouping is distinguished by a pair of crossed swords behind the central disk.<ref name="gg.ca"/> The ribbon of the Order of Merit is divided into two stripes of red and blue. Men wear their badges on a neck ribbon, while women carry theirs on a ribbon bow pinned to the left shoulder, and [[Aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] may wear the insignia on their [[aiguillette]]s.<ref name=PoW/> Since 1991, it has been required that the insignia be returned upon the recipient's death.<ref>{{Harvnb| Martin| 2007| p=56}}</ref>

===Honorary members===
There have been no honorary members of the Order of Merit since the death of the last such member, [[Nelson Mandela]], in December 2013.

==Precedence==
As the Order of Merit is open to the citizens of sixteen countries, each with their own system of orders, decorations, and medals, the order's place of precedence varies from country to country. While, in the United Kingdom, the order's postnominal letters follow those of Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, membership in the Order of Merit itself gives members no place in any of the [[orders of precedence in the United Kingdom]]. However, it has been claimed by Stanley Martin, in his book ''The Order of Merit 1902–2002: One Hundred Years of Matchless Honour'', that the Order of Merit is the pinnacle of the British honours system.<ref name="Jackson" /> Similarly, though it was not listed in the Canadian order of precedence for honours, decorations, and medals until December 2010,<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Government of Canada| author-link=Government of Canada| title=Order of Merit (O.M.)
