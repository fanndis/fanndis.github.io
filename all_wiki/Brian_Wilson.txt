'''Brian Douglas Wilson''' (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded [[<!-- DO NOT CAPITALIZE -->the Beach Boys]]. After signing with [[Capitol Records]] in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen [[Top 40]] hits for the group.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=34–150}} In addition to his unorthodox [[Musicianship of Brian Wilson|approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques]], Wilson is known for his lifelong struggles with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]]. He is often [[Brian Wilson is a genius|referred to as a genius]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Carl|author-link=Carl Wilson (writer)|title=The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson: America's Mozart?|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150608-is-this-americas-mozart|publisher=BBC|date=June 9, 2015}}</ref> and is widely acknowledged as one of the most [[Cultural impact of the Beach Boys|innovative and significant]] songwriters of the late 20th century.<ref name="conversation2015"/>

The Beach Boys were formed by Wilson with his brothers [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson|Carl]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and friend [[Al Jardine]]. Brian, who grew up influenced by 1950s [[rock and roll]] and [[jazz]]-based vocal groups, originally functioned as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader. In 1964, he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and stopped touring with the group, which led to more personal work such as ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966) and the unfinished ''[[Smile (Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''. As his mental health deteriorated, his contributions to the band diminished, and over the next decade, he was known for his reclusive lifestyle and [[substance abuse]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198, 277}} Following a 1992 court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist [[Eugene Landy]], Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment. Since the late 1990s, he has recorded and performed consistently as a solo artist.

Wilson was the first [[pop music|pop]] artist credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material. He is considered a major innovator in the field of [[music production]], the principal originator of the [[California Sound]], one of the first [[music auteur|music producer auteurs]], and among the first rock producers to [[Recording studio as an instrument|use the studio as its own instrument]]. The unusual creative control Capitol gave him over his own records effectively set a precedent that allowed other bands and artists to act as their own producers or co-producers. Wilson's success also led to a proliferation of like-minded California producers who helped supplant New York as the center of popular records. The zeitgeist of the early 1960s is commonly associated with his early songs, and he was a major influence on the retrospectively-termed "[[sunshine pop]]" and [[Flower Power]] music that proceeded.

In later years, Wilson became influential to the spirit of [[punk rock]] and was regarded as "godfather" to an era of [[indie music]]ians who were inspired by his melodic sensibilities, [[chamber pop]] orchestrations, and recording explorations. His honors include being inducted into the 1988 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] class and winning [[Grammy Award]]s for ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' (2011). In lists published by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Wilson ranked 52 for the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time" in 2008<ref name="100greatest singers"/> and 12 for the "[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]]" in 2015.<ref name="RSsongwriters"/> In 2012, music publication ''[[NME]]'' ranked Wilson number 8 in its "50 Greatest Producers Ever" list, elaborating "few consider quite how groundbreaking Brian Wilson's studio techniques were in the mid-60s".<ref name="50 Greatest Producers Ever">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/list/50-of-the-greatest-producers-ever-1353|title=The 50 Greatest Producers Ever|year=2012|publisher=Nme.com|page=5|accessdate=September 23, 2020}}</ref> His life was dramatized in the 2014 [[biopic]] ''[[Love & Mercy (film)|Love & Mercy]]''.

==Biography==

===1942–1962: Early years and performances===
[[File:Brian Wilson 1960 yearbook.png|thumb|upright|left|Wilson's senior yearbook photo, 1960]]

Brian Douglas Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, at Centinela Hospital in [[Inglewood, California]], the eldest son of Audree Neva (''née'' Korthof) and [[Murry Wilson]], a musician and machinist.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=40}} His two younger brothers were [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson|Carl]]. He has Dutch, English, German, Irish, and Swedish ancestry.<ref>{{cite web |author=Michael Thomas Meggison |url=http://www.americanancestors.org/ancestry-beach-boys/ |title=#71 Royal Descents, Notable Kin, and Printed Sources: The Immediate New England and Royal Ancestry of the Beach Boys |website=American Ancestors |publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823011549/http://www.americanancestors.org/ancestry-beach-boys/ |archive-date=August 23, 2014}}</ref> When he was two,{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=14}} the family moved from Inglewood to 3701 West 119th Street in nearby [[Hawthorne, California]].{{sfn|Stebbins|Marks |2007|p=14}} Speaking of Wilson's unusual musical abilities prior to his first birthday, his father said that, as a baby, he could repeat the melody from "When the Caissons Go Rolling Along" after only a few verses had been sung by the father. Murry Wilson said, "He was very clever and quick. I just fell in love with him."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=11}} At about age two, Wilson heard [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which had an enormous emotional impact on him.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=10}} A few years later, he was discovered to have diminished hearing in his right ear. The exact cause of this hearing loss is unclear, though theories range from him simply being born partially [[Hearing loss|deaf]] to a blow to the head from his father, or a neighborhood bully being to blame.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=12}}

Wilson's father, a minor musician and songwriter, encouraged his children in the music field in numerous ways. At an early age, Wilson was given six weeks of lessons on a "toy accordion" and, at seven and eight, sang solos in church with a choir behind him.{{sfn|Leaf|1978|pp=15–17}} Brian was [[quarterback]] on his high school [[American football|football team]] at [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]]. He also played baseball and was a cross-country runner in his senior year.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=15}} He sang with various students at school functions and with his family and friends at home, teaching his two brothers harmony parts that all three would then practice. He also played piano obsessively after school, deconstructing the harmonies of [[the Four Freshmen]] by listening to short segments of their songs on a [[phonograph]], then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard.{{sfn|Stebbins|Marks |2007|p=18}} He received a [[Wollensak]] [[tape recorder]] on his 16th birthday, allowing him to experiment with recording songs and early group vocals.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=14}}

One of Wilson's earliest public performances was at a fall arts program at his high school. He enlisted his cousin and frequent singing partner [[Mike Love]] and, to entice Carl into the group, named the newly formed membership "Carl and the Passions." The performance featured tunes by [[Dion and the Belmonts]] and the Four Freshmen ("It's a Blue World"), the latter of which proved difficult for the ensemble. The event was notable for the impression which it made on another musician and classmate of Wilson's in the audience that night, [[Al Jardine]].  Jardine would join the three Wilson brothers and Mike Love a few years later in the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=24}}

Wilson enrolled as a psychology major at [[El Camino College]] in Los Angeles, in September 1960, while simultaneously continuing his musical studies at the [[community college]] as well.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=15}} At some point in 1961 he wrote his first all-original melody, loosely based on a Dion and the Belmonts version of "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]". The song was eventually known as "[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]". Although an early demo of the song was recorded in February 1962 at World-Pacific Studios, it was not re-recorded and released until 1963, when it became a top-ten hit.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=27–31}}

Wilson, brothers Carl and Dennis, cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine first appeared as a music group in the summer of 1961, initially under the name the Pendletones. After being prodded by Dennis to write a song about the local water-sports craze, Wilson and Mike Love together created what became the first single for the band, "[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]". Over Labor Day weekend 1961, Wilson took advantage of the fact that his parents were in Mexico City for several days, and the boys used the emergency money his parents had left to rent an amplifier, a microphone, and a stand-up bass for Jardine to play. After the boys rehearsed for two days in the Wilsons' music room, his parents returned home from their trip. Eventually impressed, Murry Wilson proclaimed himself the group's manager and the band embarked on serious rehearsals for a proper studio session.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=28–29}}

[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg|thumb|right|Wilson (second-left) performing with the Beach Boys in [[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]] outfits at a local high school in late 1962]]

Recorded by Hite and Dorinda Morgan and released on the small [[Candix Records]] label, "Surfin'" became a top local hit in Los Angeles and reached number seventy-five on the national [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] sales charts.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=30–31}} Dennis later described the first time that his older brother heard their song on the radio, as the three Wilson brothers and [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]] drove in Wilson's 1957 Ford in the rain: "Nothing will ever top the expression on Brian's face, ever&nbsp;... ''that'' was the all-time moment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-beach-boys/bio/|title=The Beach Boys Biography &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=Rockhall.com|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danaddington.com/denny/quotes.html|title=Dennis Wilson: quotes|publisher=Danaddington.com|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> However, the Pendletones were no more. Without the band's knowledge or permission, Candix Records had changed their name to the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=16–17}} Wilson and his bandmates, following a set by [[Ike & Tina Turner]], performed their first major live show at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance on New Year's Eve, 1961. Three days previously, Wilson's father had bought him an electric bass and amplifier. Wilson had learned to play the instrument in that short period of time, with Al Jardine moving to rhythm guitar. On stage, Wilson provided many of the lead vocals, and often harmonized with the group in [[falsetto]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Looking for a follow-up single for their radio hit, Wilson and Mike Love wrote "[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]", and attempts were made to record a usable take at World Pacific, including overdubs, on February 8, 1962, along with several other tunes including an early version of "Surfer Girl". Only a few days later, discouraged about the band's financial prospects, and objecting to adding some [[Chubby Checker]] songs to the Beach Boys live setlist, Al Jardine abruptly left the group, but rejoined shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=20}} When Candix Records ran into money problems and sold the Beach Boys' master recordings to another label, Wilson's father terminated the contract. As "Surfin'" faded from the charts, Wilson, who had forged a songwriting partnership with [[Gary Usher]], created several new songs, including a car song, "[[409 (song)|409]]", that Usher helped them write. Wilson and the Beach Boys cut new tracks at [[United Western Recorders|Western Recorders]] including an updated "Surfin' Safari" and "409". These songs convinced Capitol Records to release the demos as a single; they became a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double-sided]] national hit.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=22–23}}

===1962–1964: Success and record producing===
[[File:The Beach Boys TV (cropped Brian).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wilson performing on electric bass with the Beach Boys, 1964]]
Recording sessions for the band's first album took place in [[Capitol Studios|Capitol's basement studios]] in the [[Capitol Records Building|famous tower building]] in August 1962, but early on Wilson lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boys tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Wilson's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights. In return, the band would receive a higher royalty rate on their record sales. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP Wilson fought for, and won, the right to be in charge of the production – though this fact was not acknowledged with an album liner notes production credit.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=26}}

In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten (cresting at number three in the United States) single, "[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at Hollywood's [[United Western Recorders]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. It was during the sessions for this single that Wilson made the production decision from that point on to use [[double tracking]] on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=32}} The [[Surfin' U.S.A.|''Surfin' U.S.A.'' album]] was also a big hit in the United States, reaching number two on the national sales charts by early July 1963. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=40}}

Wilson was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys' producer on the ''[[Surfer Girl]]'' album, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, containing singles that were top 15 hits. Feeling that surfing songs had become limiting, Wilson decided to produce a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys' fourth album, ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'', which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the ''Surfer Girl'' LP. The departure of guitarist David Marks from the band that month meant that Wilson was forced to resume touring with the Beach Boys, for a time reducing his availability in the recording studio.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=39–42}}

{{listen|filename=The Honeys - He's A Doll.ogg|pos=left|title=The Honeys – "He's a Doll" (1964)|description=Written and produced by Brian Wilson, "[[The Honeys|He's a Doll]]" was one of several attempts by Wilson to branch away from the Beach Boys.<ref name=petp/>
|filetype=[[Ogg]]}}

For much of the decade, Wilson attempted to establish himself as a record producer by working with various artists. On July 20, 1963, "[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]", which he co-wrote with [[Jan Berry]] of [[Jan and Dean]], was his first composition to reach the top of the US charts. The resulting success pleased Wilson, but angered both Murry and Capitol Records. Murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with Jan and Dean. Wilson's other non-Beach Boy work in this period included tracks by [[the Castells]], [[Donna Loren]], Sharon Marie, the Timers, and the Survivors. The most notable group to which Wilson would attach himself in this era would be [[the Honeys]], which Wilson intended as the female counterpart to the Beach Boys, and as an attempt to compete with [[Phil Spector]]-led girl groups such as [[the Crystals]] and [[the Ronettes]].<ref name=petp>{{cite web|last=Vinnis|first=Rob|title=Pet Projects liner notes|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Pet_Projects.html}}</ref> He continued juggling between recording with the Beach Boys and producing records for other artists, but with less success at the latter—except for Jan and Dean.<ref name="HimesSurf">{{cite web|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|title=Surf Music|url=http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|website=teachrock.org|publisher=Rock and Roll: An American History|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125223127/http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|archive-date=November 25, 2015}}</ref>

===1964–1967: Artistic growth===

====Resignation from touring and changing scene ====
The Beach Boys' rigorous performing schedule increasingly burdened Wilson, and following a panic attack on board a flight from L.A. to Houston on December 23, 1964,<ref name="AC interview"/> he stopped performing live with the group in an effort to concentrate solely on songwriting<ref name="Riding a wave">{{cite news |first=Robin|last=Denselow|title=Feature: ''Riding a wave''|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|issue=September 1, 1976|page=8}}</ref> and studio production.<ref name="AC interview"/> Wilson explained in 1971: "I felt I had no choice. I was run down mentally and emotionally because I was running around, jumping on jets from one city to another on one-night stands, also producing, writing, arranging, singing, planning, teaching—to the point where I had no peace of mind and no chance to actually sit down and think or even rest."<ref name="Nolan1971">{{cite magazine|last=Nolan|first=Tom|title=The Beach Boys: A California Saga|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 28, 1971|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-beach-boys-a-california-saga-19711028|issue=94|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718092340/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-beach-boys-a-california-saga-19711028|archive-date=July 18, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Glen Campbell]] was called in as his temporary stand-in for live performances,<ref name="A Boy's own story"/> before [[Bruce Johnston]] replaced him.

It was during that December that Wilson was introduced to [[cannabis]] hesitantly by his friend Lorren Daro (formerly Loren Schwartz), an assistant at the [[William Morris Agency]].{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=87}} Attracted by the drug's ability to alleviate stress and inspire creativity, Wilson completed the Beach Boys' forthcoming ''[[The Beach Boys Today!|Today!]]'' album by late January 1965 and quickly began work on their next, ''[[Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)|Summer Days]]''. Sometime in April, Wilson experienced his first [[acid trip]], which had a profound effect on his musical and spiritual conceptions.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=136}} Again, Daro was hesitant to provide drugs to Wilson, which he did not feel he was ready for, but has recounted that his dosage was "one hundred and twenty-five [[Microgram|mics]] of pure [[Owsley Stanley|Owsley]]," and that "he had the full-on [[ego death]]. It was a beautiful thing."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=174–175}} The music for "[[California Girls]]" came from this first LSD experience, a composition which was later released as a #3 charting single.<ref>{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title='California Girls' The Beach Boys|pages=F-4|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 12, 2007|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/12/entertainment/ca-socalsong12|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}</ref>

Wilson continued experimenting with [[psychotropics]] for the next few years.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=276}} He became fixated on [[psychedelia]], claiming to have coined a slang, "psychedelicate,"{{sfn|Siegel|1967}} and foreseeing that "[[psychedelic music]] will cover the face of the world and color the whole popular music scene."<ref>{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Van Dyke|title=IN RESPONSE TO: A Lost Pop Symphony from the September 22, 2005 issue|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/jan/12/smile/|work=The New York Review of Books|publisher=nybooks.com|date=January 12, 2006}}</ref> A week after his first LSD trip, Wilson began suffering from [[auditory hallucination]]s, which have persisted throughout his life.<ref name="Ability">{{cite magazine|title=Brian Wilson – A Powerful Interview|magazine=Ability|year=2006|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/past/brianW/brianw.html|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}</ref> In a 1966 interview, he referred to the rest of 1965 as an era in which he learned "a lot of things, like patience [and] understanding", while in a 1977 interview he referred to 1965 as "a year worth of paranoid".{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=67}}

====''Pet Sounds'', "genius" promotion, and ''Smile''====
{{Main|Pet Sounds|Smile (Beach Boys album)}}
[[File:Brian Wilson 1966.png|thumb|upright=0.64|right|Wilson in 1966]]
In late 1965, Wilson began working on material for a new project, ''[[Pet Sounds]]''. He formed a temporary songwriting partnership with lyricist [[Tony Asher]], who was suggested to Wilson by mutual friend Daro.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=194}} Wilson, who had recorded the album's instrumentation with [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]], then assembled the Beach Boys to record vocal [[overdub]]s, following their return from a tour of Japan. Upon hearing what Wilson had created for the first time in 1965,<ref name="AC interview"/> the group, particularly [[Mike Love]], was somewhat critical of their leader's music,<ref name="A Boy's own story"/> and expressed their dissatisfaction.<ref name="AC interview"/> At this time, Wilson still had considerable control within the group and, according to Wilson, they eventually overcame their initial negative reaction, as his newly created music began to near completion.<ref name="AC interview"/> The album was released May 16, 1966 and, despite modest sales figures at the time, has since become widely critically acclaimed, often being cited among the all-time greatest albums. Although the record was issued under the group's name, ''Pet Sounds'' is arguably seen as a Brian Wilson solo album. Wilson even toyed with the idea by releasing "[[Caroline, No]]" as a solo single in March 1966, it reaching number 32 on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name="Pet Sounds Billboard Singles">{{cite web|title=Review: ''Pet Sounds, Charts & Awards, Billboard Singles''|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1420|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation|Macrovision Corporation]] |accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}

During the ''Pet Sounds'' sessions, Wilson had been working on another song, which was held back from inclusion on the record as he felt that it was not sufficiently complete. The song "[[Good Vibrations]]" set a new standard for musicians and for what could be achieved in the recording studio. Recorded in multiple sessions and in numerous studios, the song eventually cost $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1966|fmt=eq}}) to record within a six-month period.<ref name="The nutty producers">{{cite news|first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|title=Feature: ''The nutty producers''|newspaper=[[The Guardian#G2|G2]]|issue=December 16, 1999|page=10}}</ref> In October 1966, it was released as a single, giving the Beach Boys their third US number-one hit after "[[I Get Around]]" and "[[Help Me, Rhonda]]". It sold over a million copies.

Sometime after ''Pet Sounds'' was released, the Beatles' press agent [[Derek Taylor]] started working as a publicist for the Beach Boys. He gradually became aware of Wilson's reputation as a genius among musician friends, a belief that wasn't widely held at the time.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=27}} Motivated by Wilson's musical merits, Taylor responded with a campaign that would reestablish the band's outdated surfing image, and was the first to tout Wilson as a genius.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=27}}{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=63–64}} According to Van Dyke Parks, this was "much to Brian's embarrassment".{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=63–64}}

By the time of the universal success of "Good Vibrations", Wilson was underway with his next project, ''[[Smile (Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', which Wilson described as a "teenage symphony to God." "Good Vibrations" had been recorded in modular style, with separately written sections individually tracked and spliced together, and Wilson's concept for the new album was more of the same, representing a departure from the standard live-taped performances typical of studio recordings at that time. Having been introduced to [[Van Dyke Parks]] at a garden party at [[Terry Melcher]]'s home, Wilson liked Parks' "visionary eloquence" and began working with him in the fall of 1966.<ref name="The unknown surfer">{{cite news|author=Hodgkinson, Will|title=Feature: ''The unknown surfer''|work=Friday Review|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=December 10, 1999|pages=16–17|author-link=Will Hodgkinson}}</ref> After Wilson famously installed a sandbox and tent in his living room, the pair collaborated closely on several ''Smile'' tracks. Conflict within the group and Wilson's own growing personal problems threw the project into [[Collapse of Smile|terminal disarray]]. Originally scheduled for release in January 1967, the release date was continually pushed back until press officer [[Derek Taylor]] announced its cancellation in May 1967.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===1967–1975: Career decline===
====Home studio, institutionalization, and reduced band involvement====

{{Quote box |align=right |salign = left |quote=We pulled out of that production pace, really because I was about ready to die. I was trying so hard. So, all of a sudden I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things, such big musical things. And we had so much fun.

By 1967, Wilson's life was on the verge of a serious decline. Following the cancellation of ''Smile'', the Beach Boys relocated to a studio situated in the living room of Wilson's new mansion in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] (once the home of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}),<ref>https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-beach-boys-hang-15-vol-6-no-8/</ref> where the band would primarily record until 1972. This has been perceived by some commentators as "the moment when the Beach Boys first started slipping from the vanguard to nostalgia."<ref name="AC interview">{{cite web |first=Greg|last=Beets |title=Review: ''Pet Sounds: Fifteen Minutes With Brian Wilson''|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:77984|date=July 21, 2000|publisher=Nick Barbaro |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Jonathan Perry Stern |year=2012 |page=106 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4O5qzMV2kKcC&pg=PA106&f=false Retrieved April 12, 2018.] |title=Memoirs of a Bipolar Ex-Podiatrist |publisher=Dorrance Publishing}}</ref> Throughout mid-to-late 1967, Wilson oversaw the production of only a few heavily orchestrated songs holding continuity with his ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile'' work, such as "[[Can't Wait Too Long]]" and "[[Time to Get Alone]]". Wilson's interest in the Beach Boys began to wane. Carl explained: "When we did ''Wild Honey'', Brian asked me to get more involved in the recording end. He wanted a break. He was tired. He had been doing it all too long."<ref name="MF1976" />

Still psychologically overwhelmed by the cancellation of ''Smile'' and the imminent birth of his first child [[Carnie Wilson]] in 1968 amid the looming financial insolvency of the Beach Boys, Wilson's creative directorship within the band became increasingly tenuous; additionally, [[cocaine]] had begun to supplement Wilson's regular use of amphetamines, marijuana, and psychedelics.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=139}} Shortly after abandoning an intricate arrangement of Kern and Hammerstein's "Ol' Man River" at the instigation of Mike Love,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=139, 141}} Wilson entered a [[psychiatric hospital]] for a brief period of time. Biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] has speculated that Wilson had self-admitted and may have been administered a number of treatments ranging from [[talking therapies]] to doses of [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] and [[electroconvulsive therapy]] during this stay.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=141}}

In his absence, 1969's ''[[20/20 (Beach Boys album)|20/20]]'' consisted substantially of key ''Smile'' outtakes ("[[Cabinessence]]" and "[[Our Prayer]]") along with the long-germinating "Time to Get Alone". The album's lead track, the Wilson/Love-authored "[[Do It Again (Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]", was an unabashed throwback to the band's earlier surf hits, and had been an international hit in the summer of 1968, reaching number 20 in the US charts and number 1 in the UK and Australia while also scoring well in other countries. During this phase, Wilson also collaborated with his father (credited under the pseudonym of Reggie Dunbar) on "[[Break Away (Beach Boys song)|Break Away]]", the band's final single for Capitol Records under their original contract; although relatively unsuccessful in the US (peaking at number 63 in ''Billboard''), the song reached number 6 on the British singles chart.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

At a press conference ostensibly convened to promote "Break Away" to the European media shortly thereafter, Wilson intimated that "We owe everyone money. And if we don't pick ourselves off our backsides and have a hit record soon, we will be in worse trouble&nbsp;... I've always said, 'Be honest with your fans.' I don't see why I should lie and say that everything is rosy when it's not." These incendiary remarks ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with [[Deutsche Grammophon]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=149}} Although Murry Wilson's sale of the [[Sea of Tunes]] publishing company (including the majority of Wilson's oeuvre) to [[A&M Records]]' publishing division for $700,000 at the band's commercial nadir in 1969 renewed the longstanding animus{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=169}} between father and son, the younger Wilson stood in for Mike Love during a 1970 Northwest tour when Love was convalescing from illness. He also resumed writing and recording with the Beach Boys at a brisk pace; seven of the twelve new songs on the 1970 album ''[[Sunflower (Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' were either written or co-written by Wilson. Nevertheless, the album (retrospectively appraised as "perhaps the strongest album they released post-''Pet Sounds''" by [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11665-sunflowersurfs-up/|title=The Beach Boys: Sunflower/Surf's Up Album Review|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}</ref> was a commercial failure in the US, peaking at number 151 during a four-week ''Billboard'' chart stay in October 1970. Following the termination of the Capitol contract in 1969, the band's new contract with then-au courant [[Reprise Records]] (brokered by Van Dyke Parks, employed as a multimedia executive at the company at the time) stipulated Wilson's proactive involvement with the band in all albums,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=150}} a factor that would become hugely problematic for the band in the years to come.

Sometime in 1969, Wilson opened a short-lived [[health food store]] called [[The Radiant Radish]].<ref name="Nolan1971"/> The store closed in 1971 due to unprofitable produce expenditures and Wilson's general lack of business acumen.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hind|first=John|title=This much I know – Brian Wilson, musician, 66, London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/24/popandrock|accessdate=June 28, 2013|newspaper=The Observer|date=August 23, 2008}}</ref> Reports from this era detailed Wilson as "increasingly withdrawn, brooding, hermitic&nbsp;... and occasionally, he is to be seen in the back of some limousine, cruising around Hollywood, bleary and unshaven, huddled way tight into himself."{{sfn|Cohn|1970|pp=103–104}} This notion was contested by lyricist and close friend Stanley Shapiro.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=172}} Nevertheless, Wilson's reputation suffered as a result of his purported eccentricities, and he quickly became known as a commercial has-been whom record labels feared.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=172}} When Shapiro persuaded Wilson to rewrite and rerecord a number of Beach Boys songs in order to reclaim his legacy, he contacted fellow songwriter [[Tandyn Almer]] (whom Wilson would later characterize as his "best friend")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carlindustries.com/happy-birthday-brian-wilson-an-extra-bonus-interview-with-a-man-made-for-all-times/|title=Happy Birthday, Brian Wilson!: An extra-bonus interview with a man made for all times.|website=carlindustries.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}</ref> for support.

Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wilson amassed myriad home demo recordings which later became informally known as the "[[Bedroom Tapes]]".<ref name=Bedroom2014>{{cite news|last=Chidester|first=Brian|title=Brian Wilson's Secret Bedroom Tapes|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2014-01-30/music/brian-wilsons-secret-bedroom-tapes/|accessdate=February 1, 2014|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref> Most of these recordings remain unreleased and unheard by the public. Some of the material has been described as "schizophrenia on tape," and "intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state."<ref name=Bedroom2014/> Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: "A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of [[syncopation|syncopated exercises]] and [[counterpoint]]s piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping [[Swing (jazz performance style)|shuffle grooves]]. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' '[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]' and all throughout ''Smile'', but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s."<ref name=Bedroom2014/> Wilson's daughter [[Wendy Wilson|Wendy]] remembers, "Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song."<ref name=IJWMFTT>''[[I Just Wasn't Made For These Times]]''</ref> Her sister Carnie has recounted: "My memories of him are him wandering from room to room&nbsp;... thinking about ''something''.

While working at the Radiant Radish, Wilson met journalist and radio presenter [[Jack Rieley]], who would manage the Beach Boys and act as Wilson's principal lyricist for the next few years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Sunflower_Surf_s_Up.html|title=Sunflower/Surf's Up|website=Albumlinernotes.com|accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref> Wilson played and sang on much of the 1971 ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'' album—the band's highest American album chart placement (No. 29) since 1967—and wrote or co-wrote four of the album's ten songs, including the title track. However, only one fully formed original song from Wilson emerged during the album's nominal recording sessions, the dirge-like "[[A Day in the Life of a Tree]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs71.html|title=GIGS71|publisher=Esquarterly.com|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> According to engineer [[Stephen Desper]], the cumulatively deleterious effects of Wilson's cocaine and tobacco use began to affect his vocal register in earnest during the ''Surf's Up ''sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=160}}

[[File:The Beach Boys 1971 Central Park.jpg|thumb|left|The Beach Boys performing in the early 1970s without Wilson]]

In late 1971 and early 1972, he worked on an album for the [[American Spring]], titled ''[[Spring (American Spring album)|Spring]]'', a new collaboration between erstwhile Honeys Marilyn Wilson and Diane Rovell. He was closely involved in the home-based recordings with co-producer David Sandler and engineer Stephen Desper, and did significant work on more than half of the tracks. As with much of his work in the era, his contributions "ebbed and flowed."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=176}} According to [[Dan Peek]] of [[America (band)|America]], Wilson "held court like a Mad King as [longtime friend] [[Danny Hutton]] scurried about like his court jester" during the ascendant band's engagement at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in February 1972.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=168}} Concurrently, he contributed to three out of eight songs on Beach Boys' ''[[Carl and the Passions – "So Tough"]]'' (1972).

Later that year, he reluctantly agreed to accompany the band to the Netherlands, where they based themselves to record ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]''. Although physically present, he often yielded to his vices (primarily hashish and [[hard cider]]) and rarely participated, confining himself to work on "Funky Pretty" (a collaboration with Mike Love and Jack Rieley); a one-line sung intro to Al Jardine's "[[California Saga: California]]"; and ''Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale)'', a narrative suite musically inspired by [[Randy Newman]]'s [[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|''Sail Away'']] that was promptly rejected by the band. However, Carl Wilson ultimately capitulated and ensured that the suite would be released as a bonus EP with the album.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 182}} When the album itself was rejected by Reprise, the song "[[Sail On, Sailor]]"—a collaboration with Van Dyke Parks dating from 1971 that had grown to encompass additional lyrical contributions solicited by Wilson at parties hosted by Hutton—was inserted at the instigation of Parks and released as the lead single.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 184}} It promptly garnered a considerable amount of [[FM radio]] play, became a minor chart hit, and entered the band's live sets as a concert staple.

In 1973, Jan Berry (under the alias JAN) released the single "[[Don't You Just Know It]]", a duet featuring Wilson.<ref>{{cite web|title=Discography 1970s|url=http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/main/index.php/disc/disc1970s|website=jananddean-janberry.com|accessdate=October 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123021334/http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/main/index.php/disc/disc1970s|archive-date=November 23, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After his father's death in June 1973, Wilson secluded himself in the chauffeur's quarters of his house, where he spent his time sleeping, [[Alcohol abuse|drinking]], doing drugs, overeating, and exhibiting [[self-destructive behavior]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} He attempted to drive his vehicle off a cliff, and at another time, demanded that he be pushed into and buried in a grave that he had dug in his backyard.<ref name=Bedroom2014 /> During this period, his voice deteriorated significantly as a result of his mass consumption of cocaine and incessant [[chain smoking]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=180}} Wilson later said that he was preoccupied with "[doing] drugs and hanging out with Danny Hutton" (whose house became the center of Wilson's social life) during the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=265}} [[John Sebastian]] often showed up at Wilson's Bel Air home "to jam" and later recalled that "it wasn't all grimness."{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p={{page needed|date=July 2020}}}} Although increasingly [[Recluse|reclusive]] during the day, Wilson spent many nights at Hutton's house fraternizing with [[the Hollywood Vampires|Hollywood Vampire]] colleagues, such as [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Iggy Pop]], who were mutually bemused by an extended Wilson-led singalong of the folk song "[[Shortnin' Bread#The Beach Boys|Shortnin' Bread]]"; other visitors of Hutton's home included Vampires [[Harry Nilsson]], [[John Lennon]], [[Ringo Starr]], and [[Keith Moon]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=172}} [[Micky Dolenz]] recalls taking LSD with Wilson, Lennon, and Nilsson, where Wilson "played just one note on a piano over and over again".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dolenz|first1=Micky|last2=Bego|first2=Mark|title=I'm a Believer|date=2004|publisher=Cooper Square Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-81541-284-7|pages=177–178}}</ref> On several occasions, Marilyn Wilson sent her friends to climb Hutton's fence and retrieve her husband.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=265}}

[[Jimmy Webb]] reported Wilson's presence at an August 2, 1974 session for Nilsson's "[[Duit on Mon Dei|Salmon Falls]]"; he kept in the back of the studio playing "[[Da Doo Ron Ron]]" haphazardly on a [[Hammond organ|B3 organ]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shipton|first1=Alyn|title=Nilsson: The Life of a Singer-Songwriter|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19975-657-5|page=189}}</ref> Later that month, he was photographed at Moon's 28th birthday party (held on August 28 at the [[Beverly Wilshire Hotel]]) wearing only his bathrobe. Sometime in 1974, Wilson interrupted a set by jazz musician [[Larry Coryell]] at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] by leaping onto stage and singing "[[Be-Bop-A-Lula]]", again wearing slippers and a bathrobe.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Brian's Back |magazine=Newsweek|date=July 19, 1976 |page=79 |url= http://i1188.photobucket.com/albums/z405/smayo1953/scan6.jpg |accessdate=July 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726051823/http://i1188.photobucket.com/albums/z405/smayo1953/scan6.jpg|archive-date=July 26, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

During summer 1974, the Capitol Records-era greatest hits compilation ''[[Endless Summer (Beach Boys album)|Endless Summer]]'' reached number 1 on the ''Billboard'' charts, reaffirming the relevance of the Beach Boys in the popular imagination. However, recording sessions for a new album under the supervision of Wilson and [[James William Guercio]] at [[Caribou Ranch]] and the band's studio in Santa Monica that autumn yielded only a smattering of basic tracks, including a banjo-driven arrangement of "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]"; "[[It's OK (Beach Boys song)|It's OK]]", an uptempo collaboration with Mike Love; the ballad "[[Good Timin' (Beach Boys song)|Good Timin']]"; and Dennis Wilson's "[[River Song (Dennis Wilson song)|River Song]]".{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=194–195}} Eventually, Wilson diverted his attentions to "[[Child of Winter (Christmas Song)|Child of Winter]]", a Christmas single co-written with [[Stephen Kalinich]]; released belatedly for the holiday market on December 23, it failed to chart.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=195}}

Although still under contract with Warner Brothers Records, Wilson signed a sideline production deal with Bruce Johnston and [[Terry Melcher]]'s Equinox Records in early 1975. Together, they founded the loose-knit supergroup known as [[California Music]], which involved them along with L.A. musicians [[Gary Usher]], [[Curt Boettcher]], and a few others.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} This contract was nullified by the Beach Boys' management, who perceived it as an attempt by Wilson to relieve the burden of his growing drug expenses, and it was demanded that Wilson focus his efforts on the Beach Boys, even though he strongly desired to escape from the group.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} The idea of California Music immediately disintegrated.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}}

====First treatment====
Marilyn and the Wilson family were dismayed by Wilson's continued deterioration and were reluctant to payroll him as an active partner in the touring Beach Boys, an arrangement that had persisted for a decade. They enlisted the services of radical therapist [[Eugene Landy]] in October 1975.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198–199}} Landy diagnosed Wilson as a [[paranoid schizophrenic]] (a diagnosis later retracted); under Landy's care, Wilson became more stable and socially engaged, with his productivity increasing once again.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=200}} The tagline "Brian's Back!" became a major promotional tool for the new Beach Boys album ''[[15 Big Ones]]'', released to coincide with their fifteenth anniversary as a band. The record, which consisted of a mixture of traditional pop covers with newly written original material, was released in 1976; despite lukewarm reviews, it peaked at number eight on the ''Billboard'' album chart. Wilson returned to regular stage appearances with the band, alternating between piano and bass, and made a solo appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in November 1976; to the chagrin of the other Beach Boys, producer [[Lorne Michaels]] stipulated an exclusive performance from Wilson.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=215}}

Wilson expressed a fervent desire to leave the Beach Boys and record a solo album, but was prevented by conflicts that it would create between him and the group, leading him to remark: "Sometimes I feel like a commodity in a stock market." He was also firm in that he wanted to record another work on par with the achievement of ''Pet Sounds''.<ref name=Oui/> In April 1977, the all-original album by Wilson, ''[[The Beach Boys Love You|Love You]]'', was released bearing the Beach Boys moniker, although the group's song writing contributions were minimal.

Wilson was under Landy's care for fourteen months until December 1976, when the therapist was dismissed for a dispute concerning his monthly fee.<ref name="TelegraphObit"/> Throughout the next several years, Wilson vacillated between periods of relative stability (frequently joining the touring band on piano, bass and vocals and writing or co-writing eight of the twelve tracks on 1978's poorly received ''[[M.I.U.

====Second treatment====
After Wilson overdosed on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs, he once again employed Landy.  With this effort by Landy, a more radical program was undertaken to try to restore Wilson's health.<ref name="TelegraphObit">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/03/31/db3102.xml&sSheet=/portal/2006/03/31/ixportal.html|title=Eugene Landy obituary|accessdate=April 16, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225202250/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F03%2F31%2Fdb3102.xml&sSheet=%2Fportal%2F2006%2F03%2F31%2Fixportal.html|archive-date=February 25, 2008|df=mdy}}</ref> This involved removing him from the Beach Boys on November 5, 1982 at the behest of Carl Wilson, Mike Love, and Al Jardine,<ref name="Goldberg1984"/> in addition to isolating him from his family and friends in Hawaii as well as putting him on a rigorous diet and health regimen.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=243–244}} According to Carolyn Williams, Wilson refused to see Landy: "They told him that the only way that he could be a Beach Boy again, and the only way they would release his 1982 tour disbursement money, was if he would agree to see Dr. Landy. Brian started yelling that he didn't like Dr. Landy and that [Landy] was charging him $20,000 a month the last time. He was willing to see anybody to get the weight off, but he didn't want to see Landy. And they said, 'Well, no, you have to see Dr. Landy. That's the only way.'"<ref name="Goldberg1984"/> Landy described the program that he accorded Wilson in ''The Handbook of Innovative Psychotherapies'':
{{quote|The success of twenty-four-hour therapy rests on the extent to which the therapeutic team can exert control over every aspect of the patient's life. ...&nbsp;[The goal is to] totally disrupt the privacy of [the] patient's [life], gaining complete control over every aspect of their physical, personal, social, and sexual environments.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=243}}}}
[[File:Brian Wilson 1983.png|thumb|Wilson performing with the Beach Boys in 1983]]
Coupled with long, extreme counseling sessions, this therapy was successful in bringing Wilson back to physical health, slimming down from {{convert|311|lb|kg}} to {{convert|185|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brian Wilson on the Beach Boys, Gershwin and his upcoming biopic|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2011/11/brian-wilson-on-biopic-the-beach-boys-gershwin|work=IFC|accessdate=August 28, 2013|date=November 16, 2011}}</ref> As Wilson's recovery consolidated, he rejoined the Beach Boys for [[Live Aid]] in 1985 and participated in the recording of the [[Steve Levine]]-produced album ''[[The Beach Boys (album)|The Beach Boys]]''. Wilson stopped working with the Beach Boys on a regular basis after the release of the album, largely due to the control that Landy exercised. Eventually, Landy's therapy technique created a [[Svengali]]-like environment for Wilson, controlling every movement in his life, including his musical direction.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=254–258}} In the mid 1980s, Landy stated, "I influence all of [Brian]'s thinking. I'm practically a member of the band&nbsp;... [We're] partners in life."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=244, 256}} Wilson later responded to allegations with, "People say that Dr. Landy runs my life, but the truth is, I'm in charge."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=257}}

Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually. When he requested more money, Carl Wilson was obliged to give away a quarter of Wilson's publishing royalties.<ref name="TelegraphObit"/> In 1988, Wilson said that "Dr. Landy doesn't like me to be in touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten."<ref>{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Timothy|author-link1=Timothy White (writer)|title=BACK FROM THE BOTTOM|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/magazine/back-from-the-bottom.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 26, 1988}}</ref>

Wilson signed to a solo record deal with [[Sire Records]] label boss [[Seymour Stein]] and worked with [[Andy Paley]], [[Russ Titelman]] and Landy's girlfriend on the new material. Old friend and collaborator [[Gary Usher]] was a key participant in the early demo work for the album, though Landy later removed him from the project. After several years of genesis, Wilson released his debut solo album ''[[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson]]''. His work may have been hampered by Landy's influence, since Landy insisted on controlling involvement in every aspect of Wilson's writing and recording and his lyrical influence is significant.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Despite the critical success of his debut solo album, rumors abounded that Wilson had either suffered a [[stroke]] or had been permanently disabled due to excessive drug use.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=271}} Wilson, who had been prescribed massive amounts of [[psychotropic drugs]] by Landy's staff since 1983, had developed [[tardive dyskinesia]],{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=271, 280}} a neurological condition marked by involuntary, repetitive movements, that develops in about 20 percent of patients treated with [[anti-psychotic]] drugs for an extended period of time.<ref>Sweet, R.A., Mulsant, B.

An ostensible memoir, ''[[Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story]]'', was published in 1991. In the book, whose authorship is still debated, Wilson spoke about his troubled relationship with his abusive father Murry, his private disputes with the Beach Boys and his lost years of mental illness.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=270, 272–273}} Landy's illegal use of psychotropic drugs on Wilson, and his influence over Wilson's financial affairs, were legally ended by his brother Carl and other members of the Wilson family after a two-year-long conservatorship battle in Los Angeles.

====Collaborations and unfinished projects====
{{Further|Andy Paley sessions}}

Wilson released two albums simultaneously in 1995. The first was the [[I Just Wasn't Made for These Times|soundtrack]] to [[Don Was]]'s documentary ''[[Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made for These Times|I Just Wasn't Made for These Times]]'', which consisted of new versions of several Beach Boys and solo songs. The second, ''[[Orange Crate Art]]'', saw Wilson as lead vocalist on an album produced, arranged and written by [[Van Dyke Parks]]. ''I Just Wasn't Made for These Times'' includes Wilson performing for the first time with his now-adult daughters, [[Wendy Wilson|Wendy]] and [[Carnie Wilson|Carnie]] of the group [[Wilson Phillips]] and Van Dyke Parks. During the early 1990s, he also worked on some tracks with [[power pop]] band [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]], which remain unreleased.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Justin|title=Rocky Mountain News|url=http://zenandjuice.com/music/jellyfish/text/rocky-070993.txt|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Rocky Mountain News|date=July 9, 1993}}</ref> [[Roger Joseph Manning, Jr.|Roger Manning]] has recounted an anecdote during these sessions involving Wilson falling asleep at the piano yet continuing to play.<ref name="Atlantic City 2013" /> Later in the decade, Wilson and his daughters Carnie and Wendy would release an album together, titled ''[[The Wilsons]]'' (1997). Also, around this time, Wilson sang backup vocals on [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s "[[California (Belinda Carlisle song)|California]]".

Having missed out on the Beach Boys' 27th studio album ''[[Summer in Paradise]]'', Wilson returned to the Beach Boys for [[Andy Paley sessions|sporadic recording sessions and live performances during the early to mid-1990s]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Back to the Beach|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296612,00.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Entertainment|date=March 31, 1995}}</ref> Working with collaborators Andy Paley and Don Was, the sessions were reported to have been tenuous. It had also been discussed that Wilson and the Beach Boys would work with [[Sean O'Hagan]] of [[the High Llamas]] on a comeback album for Wilson and the Beach Boys.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stratton|first=Jeff|title=Bandwidth|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2000-10-26/music/bandwidth/|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Porward Palm Beach New Times|date=October 26, 2000}}</ref> All projects collapsed and, instead, Wilson was involved with the 1996 Beach Boys album ''[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]'': a group collaboration, backing country music artists singing lead vocals of Beach Boys' standards.

In 1998, Wilson teamed with Chicago-based producer [[Joe Thomas (producer)|Joe Thomas]] for the album ''[[Imagination (Brian Wilson album)|Imagination]].'' Following this, he received extensive vocal coaching to improve his voice, learned to cope with his [[glossophobia|stage fright]], and started to consistently perform live for the first time in decades. This resulted in Wilson successfully performing the entire ''Pet Sounds'' album live throughout the US, UK and Europe. In 1999, Wilson filed a suit against Thomas, seeking damages and a declaration which freed him to work on his next album without involvement from Thomas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bad Vibrations: Brian Wilson Sues Collaborator |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bad-vibrations-brian-wilson-sues-collaborator-19990824|work=Rolling Stone|date=August 24, 1999}}</ref> The suit was made after Thomas allegedly began to raise his industry profile and wrongfully enrich himself through his association with Wilson. Thomas reciprocated with a suit citing that Melinda Wilson "schemed against and manipulated" him and Wilson. The case was settled out of court.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brian Wilson Settles Suit With Former Partner|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/brian-wilson-settles-suit-with-former-partner-20000718|work=Rolling Stone|date=July 18, 2000}}</ref> Wilson's third solo album ''[[Gettin' In Over My Head]]'' (2004) featured collaborations with [[Elton John]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Eric Clapton]] and brother Carl, who died of [[lung cancer]] in February 1998.

With his mental health on the mend, Wilson decided to revisit the aborted ''Smile'' project from 1967. Aided by musician and longtime fan [[Darian Sahanaja]] of Wondermints, and lyricist Van Dyke Parks, Wilson reimagined the session material into something that would work in a live context. His work was finally revealed in concert on February 20, 2004, 37 years after it was conceived, though he later stated that the finished product was substantially different from what was originally envisioned. Wilson debuted his 2004 interpretation of ''Smile'' at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London and subsequently toured the UK. Following the tour, ''Brian Wilson Presents Smile'' was recorded, and released in September 2004. The release hit number 13 on the [[Billboard chart|''Billboard'' chart]]. At the [[47th Grammy Awards]] in 2005, Wilson won his first Grammy for the track "[[The Elements: Fire|Mrs. O'Leary's Cow]]" as Best Rock Instrumental. In 2004, Wilson promoted ''Brian Wilson Presents Smile'' with a tour of Australia, New Zealand and Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In December 2005, Wilson released ''[[What I Really Want for Christmas]]'' for [[Arista Records]]. The release hit number 200 on the ''Billboard'' chart, though sales were modest. Wilson's remake of "Deck the Halls" became a surprise Top 10 Adult Contemporary hit.

Around this time, Wilson announced that he was developing another concept album, titled ''Pleasure Island: A Rock Fantasy''. Accordingly: "It's about some guys who took a hike, and they found a place called Pleasure Island. And they met all kinds of chicks, and they went on rides and — it's just a concept.

Wilson's understanding of [[music theory]] was self-taught.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=112}} The first instrument he learned to play was a toy [[accordion]]{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=11}} before quickly moving to piano and then bass guitar.{{sfn|Zager|2011|pp=215–216}} From an early age, Wilson demonstrated an extraordinary skill for [[learning music by ear]] on keyboard.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=2, 8}} According to bassist [[Carol Kaye]], "He took bass up another step. He saw it as integral in a symphonic orchestra. He used bass as the framework for a hit record. Very few people can write for bass, but his writing was beautiful. There are a lot of jazz musicians who admire him for it."{{sfn|Dillon |2012|p={{page needed|date=July 2020}}}}
