The '''Nasdaq Stock Market''', {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-NASDAQ.ogg|ˈ|n|æ|z|ˌ|d|æ|k}} also known as '''Nasdaq''' or '''NASDAQ''', is an American [[stock exchange]] at [[One Liberty Plaza]] in [[New York City]]. It is ranked second on the [[list of stock exchanges]] by [[market capitalization]] of shares traded, behind the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Monthly Reports |url=http://www.world-exchanges.org/statistics/monthly-reports |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817220823/http://www.world-exchanges.org/statistics/monthly-reports |archive-date=August 17, 2014 |website=World-Exchanges.org |publisher=[[World Federation of Exchanges]]}}</ref> The exchange platform is owned by [[Nasdaq, Inc.]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nasdaq – Business Solutions & Services |url=http://www.business.nasdaq.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020164343/http://business.nasdaq.com/ |archive-date=October 20, 2016 |access-date=June 16, 2016 |website=nasdaq.com |df=mdy-all}}</ref> which also owns the [[Nasdaq Nordic]] stock market network and several U.S. stock and [[Options (finance)|options exchanges]].

==History==
===1971–2000===
[[File:NASDAQ.svg|thumb|Former logo used from 1971 to 2014]]
"Nasdaq" was initially an [[acronym]] for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations.<ref>[http://www.nasdaq.com/help/helpfaq.stm Frequently Asked Questions. NASDAQ.com. NASDAQ, n.d. Web. December 23, 2001.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429200618/http://www.nasdaq.com/help/helpfaq.stm | date=April 29, 2010}}</ref>

It was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), now known as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA).<ref name="history">{{Cite web |last=Terrell |first=Ellen |title=History of the American and Nasdaq Stock Exchanges |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/business/amex/amex.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414213410/http://www.loc.gov/rr/business/amex/amex.html |archive-date=April 14, 2013 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On February 8, 1971, the Nasdaq stock market began operations as the world's first electronic stock market.<ref name=history/> At first, it was merely a "quotation system" and did not provide a way to perform electronic trades.<ref>{{Cite web |last=KENNON |first=JOSHUA |date=March 26, 2019 |title=What Is the NASDAQ? |url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-nasdaq-356343 |website=[[Dotdash]]}}</ref> The Nasdaq Stock Market helped lower the [[bid–ask spread]] (the price difference between sellers and buyers), but was unpopular among brokers as it reduced their profits.

The NASDAQ Stock Market eventually assumed the majority of major trades that had been executed by the [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) system of trading, but there are still many securities traded in this fashion. As late as 1987, the Nasdaq exchange was still commonly referred to as "OTC" in media reports<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gilpin |first=Kenneth N. |date=July 3, 1987 |title=Company News: An Erratic Quarter for Stock Markets |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/03/business/company-news-an-erratic-quarter-for-stock-markets.html |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801050610/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/03/business/company-news-an-erratic-quarter-for-stock-markets.html |archive-date=August 1, 2017 |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> and also in the monthly Stock Guides (stock guides and procedures) issued by [[Standard & Poor's]] Corporation.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Salinger |first=Lawrence M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Vh2AwAAQBAJ&q=nasdaq+OTC+in+stock+guides+issued+by++standard+and+poor%27s+corporation&pg=PA638 |title=Encyclopedia of White-Collar and Corporate Crime |date=2013-06-14 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-4522-7616-8 |language=en}}</ref>

Over the years, the Nasdaq Stock Market became more of a stock market by adding trade and volume reporting and automated trading systems.

In 1981, Nasdaq traded 37% of the U.S. securities markets' total of 21&nbsp;billion shares. By 1991, Nasdaq's share had grown to 46%.<ref>{{Cite news |last=WIDDER |first=PAT |date=May 24, 1992 |title=NASDAQ HAS EYE ON NEXT 100 YEARS |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1992-05-24-2855271-story.html}}</ref>

In 1998, it was the first stock market in the United States to trade online, using the slogan "the stock market for the next hundred years".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Feb 8, 1971 CE: 'Stock Market for the Next 100 Years' Opens |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/feb8/stock-market-next-100-years-opens/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719000823/http://nationalgeographic.org/thisday/feb8/stock-market-next-100-years-opens/ |archive-date=July 19, 2016 |access-date=September 16, 2019 |publisher=[[National Geographic]]}}</ref> The Nasdaq Stock Market attracted many companies during the [[dot-com bubble]].

Its main index is the [[NASDAQ Composite]], which has been published since its inception. The QQQ [[exchange-traded fund]] tracks the large-cap [[NASDAQ-100]] index, which was introduced in 1985 alongside the [[NASDAQ Financial-100]] Index, which tracks the largest 100 companies in terms of market capitalization.

In 1992, the Nasdaq Stock Market joined with the [[London Stock Exchange]] to form the first intercontinental linkage of [[capital market]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Odekon |first=Mehmet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8O9nBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1267 |title=Booms and Busts: An Encyclopedia of Economic History from the First Stock Market Crash of 1792 to the Current Global Economic Crisis: An Encyclopedia of Economic History from the First Stock Market Crash of 1792 to the Current Global Economic Crisis |date=March 17, 2015 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781317475750 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803133123/https://books.google.com/books?id=8O9nBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1267&lpg=PT1267&dq=Nasdaq+Stock+Market+the+london+Stock+exchange+1992&source=bl&ots=d38bpq3ilz&sig=InzyQeRcE9YPbN6zos3Oxzbq2B0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjes-G-2rrVAhUm2oMKHVJUCzkQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&q=Nasdaq%20Stock%20Market%20the%20london%20Stock%20exchange%201992&f=false |archive-date=August 3, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2000, the National Association of Securities Dealers spun off the Nasdaq Stock Market to form a [[public company]].

In a series of sales in 2000 and 2001, FINRA sold its stake in the Nasdaq.

In 2006, the status of the Nasdaq Stock Market was changed from a stock market to a licensed national securities exchange.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Walsh |first=Michelle |title=Nasdaq Stock Market Becomes A National Securities Exchange; Changes Market Designations |url=http://www.gfrlaw.com/pubs/GordonPubDetail.aspx?xpST=PubDetail&pub=109 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217225809/http://www.gfrlaw.com/pubs/GordonPubDetail.aspx?xpST=PubDetail&pub=109 |archive-date=December 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

To qualify for listing on the exchange, a company must be registered with the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), must have at least three [[market maker]]s (financial firms that act as brokers or dealers for specific securities) and must meet minimum requirements for assets, capital, public shares, and shareholders.

In February 2011, in the wake of an announced merger of [[NYSE Euronext]] with [[Deutsche Börse]], speculation developed that NASDAQ OMX and [[Intercontinental Exchange]] (ICE) could mount a counter-bid of their own for NYSE.

The European Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System (EASDAQ) was founded as a European equivalent to the Nasdaq Stock Market. It was purchased by NASDAQ in 2001 and became NASDAQ Europe. In 2003, operations were shut down as a result of the burst of the [[dot-com bubble]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=August 11, 2003 |title=Nasdaq Might Shut Down German Exchange |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |url=https://www.dw.com/en/nasdaq-might-shut-down-german-exchange/a-945442}}</ref> In 2007, NASDAQ Europe was revived first as Equiduct, and later that year, it was acquired by [[Börse Berlin]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Easdaq Makes A Comeback As Equiduct |url=http://www.securitiestechnologymonitor.com/supplements/20061231/19226-1.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106155659/http://www.securitiestechnologymonitor.com/supplements/20061231/19226-1.html |archive-date=January 6, 2011 |access-date=February 3, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Market tiers== <!-- [[NGS]] redirects here -->
The Nasdaq Stock Market has three different market tiers:
* '''Capital Market''' (NASDAQ-CM [[Market capitalization|small cap]]) is an equity market for companies that have relatively small levels of market capitalization. Listing requirements for such "small cap" companies are less stringent than for other Nasdaq markets that list larger companies with significantly higher market capitalization.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Definition of 'Nasdaq SmallCap Market', now known as Nasdaq Capital Market |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq-smallcap-market.asp |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804063221/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq-smallcap-market.asp |archive-date=August 4, 2013 |publisher=[[Investopedia]] |df=mdy-all}}</ref>
* '''Global Market''' (NASDAQ-GM [[mid cap]]) is made up of stocks that represent the Nasdaq Global Market. The Global Market consists of 1,450 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and liquidity requirements, and corporate governance standards. The Global Market is less exclusive than the Global Select Market.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Definition of 'Nasdaq Global Market Composite' |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nqgm.asp |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917082250/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nqgm.asp |archive-date=September 17, 2013 |publisher=[[Investopedia]] |df=mdy-all}}</ref>
* '''Global Select Market''' (NASDAQ-GS [[large cap]]) is a market capitalization-weighted index made up of US-based and international stocks that represent the Global Select Market Composite. The Global Select Market consists of 1,200 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and liquidity requirements and corporate governance standards.
