The '''Acadians''' ({{lang-fr|Acadiens}}, ''Acadiennes'' {{IPA-fr|akadjɛ̃|IPA}}) are the descendants of the [[French colonial empire|French]] who [[Old Acadian Villages of Nova Scotia|settled]] in [[Acadia]] during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Acadia was located in what is now [[Eastern Canada]]'s [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]] ([[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Prince Edward Island]]), as well as parts of [[Quebec]], and present-day [[Maine]] to the [[Kennebec River]], Acadia was a distinctly separate colony of [[New France]]. It was ethnically, geographically and administratively different from the other French colonies and the [[Canada (New France)|French colony of Canada]] (modern-day Quebec). As a result, the Acadians developed a distinct history and culture.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Landry |first1=Nicolas |last2=Lang |first2=Nicole |title=Histoire de l'Acadie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SES4PQuGaooC&pg=PP1 |year=2001 |publisher=Les éditions du Septentrion |isbn=978-2-89448-177-6}}</ref> The settlers whose descendants became Acadians primarily came from the southwestern region of France, such as the rural areas of [[Poitou-Charentes]] and [[Aquitaine]] ([[Gascony]]).<ref>{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=N.E.S. |title=From Migrant to Acadian: A North American Border People, 1604-1755 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cG4wSmIlziYC&pg=PA47 |year=2005 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |isbn=978-0-7735-2699-0 |page=47}}</ref>
 
During the [[French and Indian War]] (the North American theater of the [[Seven Years' War]]), British colonial officers suspected that Acadians were aligned with France, after finding some Acadians fighting alongside French troops at [[Fort Beauséjour]]. Though most Acadians remained neutral during the war, the British, together with [[New England]] legislators and militia, carried out the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Expulsion]] (Le Grand Dérangement) of the Acadians between 1755 and 1764. They forcefully deported approximately 11,500 Acadians from the maritime region. Approximately one-third perished from disease and drowning.<ref name=lock>{{cite journal |last=Lockerby |first=Earle |title=The Deportation of the Acadians from Ile St.-Jean, 1758 |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |volume=XXVII |issue=2 |pages=45–94 |date=Spring 1998 |jstor=30303223 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/10844/11665}}</ref> The result was described as an [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Acadians from Maritime Canada.<ref>John Faragher.

Their descendants gradually developed what became known as [[Cajuns|Cajun]] culture.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Han |first1=Eunjung |last2=Carbonetto |first2=Peter |last3=Curtis |first3=Ross E. |last4=Wang |first4=Yong |last5=Granka |first5=Julie M. |last6=Byrnes |first6=Jake |last7=Noto |first7=Keith |last8=Kermany |first8=Amir R. |last9=Myres |first9=Natalie M. |date=2017-02-07 |title=Clustering of 770,000 genomes reveals post-colonial population structure of North America |journal=Nature Communications |volume=8 |pages=14238 |doi=10.1038/ncomms14238 |pmid=28169989 |pmc=5309710 |issn=2041-1723 |bibcode=2017NatCo...814238H}}</ref>

In time, some Acadians returned to the Maritime provinces of Canada, mainly to New Brunswick.<ref>{{cite web |title=A scenic tour of New Brunswick's East Coast |url=https://www.westjetmagazine.com/story/article/scenic-tour-new-brunswicks-east-coast |date=2013-08-21 |website=WestJet Magazine |access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref> The British prohibited them from resettling their lands and villages in what became Nova Scotia. Before the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Crown settled Protestant European immigrants and [[New England Planters]] in former Acadian communities and farmland. After the war, it made land grants in Nova Scotia to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (including nearly 3,000 [[Black Loyalist|Black Loyalists]], [[Freedman|slaves of rebels]] given freedom after joining British forces). British policy was to establish a majority culture of Protestant religions and to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] Acadians with the local populations where they resettled.<ref name=lock/>

Acadians speak a variety of French called [[Acadian French]]. Many of those in the [[Moncton]] area speak [[Chiac]] and English. The Louisiana Cajun descendants speak [[Cajun English]]. Many also speak [[Louisiana French|Cajun French]], a close relative of Acadian French from Canada but influenced by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the [[Niger–Congo languages|West African languages]].

The Acadians may be included among the French Canadian group in linguistic contexts, but are considered a separate group from the French Canadians in a cultural and ethnic sense because of their distinct history, which predates the admission of the Maritime Provinces to the [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867.

[[Image:Acadia 1754.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Acadia (1754)]]

During the early 17th century,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford companion to Canadian history|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Hallowell, Gerald.|isbn=978-0195415599|location=Don Mills, Ont.|oclc=54971866|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont0000unse_o5y1}}</ref> about 60 [[Old Acadian Villages of Nova Scotia|French families were established in Acadia]]. They developed friendly relations with the peoples of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] (particularly the regional [[Miꞌkmaq|Mi'kmaq]]), learning their hunting and fishing techniques developed for local conditions. The Acadians lived mainly in the coastal regions of the [[Bay of Fundy]]; they reclaimed farming land from the sea by building dikes to control water and drain certain wetlands. Living in a contested borderland region between French Canada and the British territories on New England and the coast, the Acadians often became entangled in the conflict between the powers. Their competition in Europe played out in North America as well. Over a period of 74 years, six wars (the four [[French and Indian Wars]], [[Father Rale's War]], and [[Father Le Loutre's War]]) took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia, in which the Wabanaki Confederacy and some Acadians fought to keep the British from taking over the region. While France lost political control of Acadia in 1713, the Mí'kmaq did not concede land to the British. Along with  Acadians, the Mi'kmaq from time to time used military force to resist the British.  That was particularly evident in the early 1720s during [[Dummer's War]], but hostilities were brought to a close by a treaty signed in 1726.

The British had conquered Acadia in 1710. Over the next 45 years, the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. Many were influenced by Father [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]], who from his arrival in 1738 until his capture in 1755, preached against the 'English devils'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parkman|first=Francis|author-link=Francis Parkman|title=Montcalm and Wolfe|url=https://archive.org/details/montcalmandwolf08parkgoog|series=France and England in North America|year=1914|publisher=Little, Brown|orig-year=1884}}</ref> Father Le Loutre led the Acadian people during the [[Acadian Exodus]], as an act of defiance towards British demands and oppression. Acadians took part in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] and [[Fort Beauséjour|Fort Beausejour]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Grenier|first=John|title=The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710–1760|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXoCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1|year=2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8566-8}}</ref> During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat posed by the Acadians and to interrupt the vital supply lines which they provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Stephen E. |chapter=Indian-White Relations in Nova Scotia, 1749–61: A Study in Political Interaction |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnxIPgAACAAJ&pg=PA105 |editor1-last=Buckner |editor1-first=Phillip Alfred |editor2-last=Campbell |editor2-first=Gail Grace |editor3-last=Frank |editor3-first=David |title=The Acadiensis Reader: Atlantic Canada Before Confederation |date=1998 |pages=105–106|isbn=9780919107441 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Stephen E.|chapter=1744–1763: Colonial Wars and Aboriginal Peoples|editor1=Phillip Buckner|editor2=John G.

The British founded the town of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] and fortified it in 1749 in order to establish a base against the French. The Mi'kmaq resisted the increased number of British (Protestant) settlements by making numerous raids on Halifax, [[Raid on Dartmouth (1751)|Dartmouth]], Lawrencetown, and [[Raid on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (1756)|Lunenburg]]. During the French and Indian War, the Mi'kmaq assisted the Acadians in resisting the British during the Expulsion of the Acadians.{{sfnp|Faragher|2005|pp=110–112}}

Many Acadians might have signed an unconditional oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better, while other Acadians would not sign because they were anti-British. The French and British competition had a long history, including opposing Christian established religions: Catholic in France and its colonies, and Protestant (Anglican) in England.<ref>For the best account of Acadian armed resistance to the British, see Grenier, John. ''The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760.'' Norman: U of Oklahoma P, 2008.</ref> Acadians had numerous reasons against signing an oath of loyalty to the British Crown. The British monarch was the head of the [[Church of England]]. Acadian men feared that signing the oath would commit them to fighting against France during wartime. They also worried about whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive an oath as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than that of the indigenous Mi'kmaq. Acadians believed that if they signed the oath, they might put their villages at risk of attack by the Mi'kmaq.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=John G.|title=Nova Scotia: A Pocket History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-69QAAACAAJ&pg=PA49|year=2009|publisher=Fernwood |isbn=978-1-55266-325-7|page=49}}</ref>

==Deportation==
{{Main|Expulsion of the Acadians}}
[[File:La Deportation des Acadiens par Henri Beau.jpg|thumb|The Deportation of Acadians by Henri Beau]]
[[File:A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grymross, by Thomas Davies, 1758.JPG|thumb|[[St. John River Campaign]]: ''A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grimross'' (present-day [[Gagetown, New Brunswick]]) by [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]], 1758. This is the only contemporaneous image of the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]].]]

In the Great Expulsion (known by French speakers as ''le Grand Dérangement''), after the [[Battle of Fort Beauséjour]] beginning in August 1755 under [[Charles Lawrence (British Army officer)|Lieutenant Governor Lawrence]], approximately 11,500 Acadians (three-quarters of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia) were expelled, families were separated, their lands and property confiscated, and in some cases their homes were burned. The Acadians were deported to separated locations throughout the British eastern seaboard colonies, from New England to Georgia, where many were put into forced labour or imprisoned. 

After 1758, thousands were transported to France. Most of the Acadians who later went to Louisiana sailed there from France on five Spanish ships. These had been provided by the Spanish Crown, which was eager to populate their Louisiana colony with Catholic settlers who might provide farmers to supply the needs of New Orleans residents. The Spanish had hired agents to seek out the dispossessed Acadians in Brittany and kept this effort secret in order to avoid angering the French king. These new arrivals from France joined the earlier wave expelled from Acadia, and gradually their descendants developed the Cajun population (which included multiracial unions and children) and culture. They continued to be attached to French culture and language, and Catholicism.

[[Image:Grand Pré.JPG|thumb|left|Sculptor [[Louis-Philippe Hébert]]'s sculpture of [[Evangeline]] at the [[Grand-Pré National Historic Site]] in [[Nova Scotia]]|203x203px]]

The Spanish offered the Acadians lowlands along the [[Mississippi River]] in order to block British expansion from the east. Some would have preferred Western Louisiana, where many of their families and friends had settled. In addition, that land was more suitable to mixed crops of agriculture. Rebels among them marched to New Orleans and ousted the Spanish governor. The Spanish later sent infantry from other colonies to put down the rebellion and execute the leaders. After the rebellion in December 1769, Spanish Governor O'Reilly permitted the Acadians who had settled across the river from [[Natchez, Louisiana|Natchez]] to resettle along the [[Bayou Manchac|Iberville]] or [[Amite River|Amite]] rivers closer to [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Jack D.L.|title=A Guide to Spanish Louisiana, 1762-1806|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfEvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5|year=1970|publisher=A. F. Laborde|page=5}}</ref>

The British conducted a second and smaller expulsion of Acadians after taking control of the north shore of what is now [[New Brunswick]]. After the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|fall of Quebec]] and defeat of the French, the British lost interest in such relocations. Many Acadians gradually returned to [[British North America]], settling in coastal villages that were not occupied by colonists from New England. A few of the Acadians in this area had evaded the British for several years, but the brutal winter weather eventually forced them to surrender. Some returnees settled in the region of Fort Sainte-Anne, now [[Fredericton]], but were later displaced when the Crown awarded land grants to numerous [[United Empire Loyalist|United Empire Loyalists]] from the Thirteen Colonies after the victory of the United States in the [[American Revolution]]. Most of the descendants of Acadian returnees now live primarily on the eastern coast of New Brunswick, Canada.
[[File:Acadian deportation map.jpg|thumb|261x261px|Map of the Deportation/Expulsion of the Acadians (1755-1816)]]
In 2003, at the request of Acadian representatives, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada]] issued a [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|Royal Proclamation]] acknowledging the deportation. She established July 28 as an annual day of commemoration, beginning in 2005. The day is called the "Great Upheaval" on some English-language calendars.

==Geography==
[[Image:The Acadians.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Present-day Acadian communities]]
The Acadians today live predominantly in the Canadian Maritime provinces (New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia), as well as parts of Quebec, Canada, and in Louisiana and Maine, United States. 

In New Brunswick, Acadians inhabit the northern and eastern shores of New Brunswick. Other groups of Acadians can be found in the [[Magdalen Islands]] and the [[Gaspé Peninsula]]. Ethnic Acadian descendants still live in and around the area of [[Madawaska, Maine]], where some of the Acadians first landed and settled in what is now known as the St. John Valley. There are also Acadians in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, at [[Chéticamp, Nova Scotia|Chéticamp]], [[Isle Madame (Nova Scotia)|Isle Madame]], and [[Municipality of the District of Clare|Clare]]. East and West [[Pubnico (village), Nova Scotia|Pubnico]], located at the end of the province, are the oldest regions that are predominantly ethnic Acadian.

Other ethnic Acadians can be found in the southern regions of New Brunswick, Western Newfoundland and in New England. Many of these communities have assimilated to varying degrees into the majority culture of English speakers. For many families in predominantly [[English language|Anglophone]] communities, French-[[language attrition]] has occurred, particularly in younger generations.

The Acadians who settled in [[Louisiana]] after 1764 became known as Cajuns for the culture they developed. They have had a dominant cultural influence in many [[Parish (subnational entity)|parishes]], particularly in the southwestern area of the state, which is known as [[Acadiana]].

==Culture==
[[File:Tintamarre during National Acadian Day 2009, Caraquet New Brunswick.jpg|thumb|The [[Tintamarre]] in [[Caraquet]], [[New Brunswick]]]]

Acadians are a vibrant minority, particularly in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada, and in Louisiana (Cajuns) and northern Maine, United States. Since 1994, ''[[Acadian World Congress|Le Congrès Mondial Acadien]]'' has worked as an organization to unite these disparate communities and help preserve the culture.

In 1881, Acadians at the First Acadian National Convention, held in [[Memramcook, New Brunswick|Memramcook]], New Brunswick, designated August 15, the Christian feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]], as the [[National Acadian Day|national feast day]] of their community. On that day, the Acadians celebrate by having a ''[[tintamarre]],'' a big parade and procession for which people dress up with the colors of Acadia and make a lot of noise and music. The [[national anthem]] of the Acadians is "[[Ave Maris Stella]]", adopted in 1884 at [[Miscouche]], Prince Edward Island. The anthem was revised at the 1992 meeting of the Société Nationale de l'Acadie. The second, third and fourth verses were translated into French, with the first and last kept in the original [[Latin]].

The Federation des Associations de Familles Acadiennes of New Brunswick and the Société Saint-Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island have resolved to commemorate December 13 annually as "Acadian Remembrance Day," in memory of the sinking of the ''[[Duke William (ship)|Duke William]]'' and of the nearly 2,000 Acadians deported from Ile-Saint Jean who died in 1758 while being deported across the North Atlantic: from hunger, disease and drowning.<ref>''Pioneer Journal'', Summerside, Prince Edward Island, 9 December 2009.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}</ref> The event has been commemorated annually since 2004; participants mark the day by wearing a black star.

The poem became an American classic. Activists used it as a catalyst in reviving a distinct  Acadian identity in both Maritime Canada and in Louisiana. [[Antonine Maillet]]'s novel ''[[Pélagie-la-charette]]'' concerns the return voyage to Acadia of several deported families, starting 15 years after the Great Expulsion.

In the early 20th century, two statues were made of the fictional figure of "Evangeline" to commemorate the Expulsion: one was installed in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana]] and the other in [[Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia]]. The Acadian Memorial (Monument Acadien) has an eternal flame;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.acadianmemorial.org/the-eternal-flame.php | title = Acadian Memorial - The Eternal Flame | access-date = October 18, 2012}}</ref> it honors the 3,000 Acadians who settled in Louisiana after the Expulsion. Monuments to the Acadian Expulsion have been erected at several sites in the Maritime Provinces, such as at [[Georges Island (Nova Scotia)|Georges Island]], Nova Scotia, and at [[Beaubears Island]].

The [[Flag of Acadia|flag of the Acadians]] is the French [[Flag of France|tricolour]], with the addition of a golden star in the blue field. This symbolizes Saint [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], Our Lady of the Assumption, [[patron saint]] of the Acadians and widely known as the "[[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]]". This flag was adopted in 1884 at the Second Acadian National Convention, held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island.

Acadians in the diaspora have adopted other symbols. The flag of Acadians in Louisiana, known as Cajuns, was designed by Thomas J. Arceneaux of the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]]. In 1974 it was adopted by the Louisiana legislature as the official emblem of the Acadiana region. The state has supported the culture, in part because it has attracted cultural and heritage tourism.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.acadian-cajun.com/acflag.htm | title = Acadian Flag |work=Acadian-Cajun.com | access-date = 2011-10-02}}</ref>

In 2004 New England Acadians, who were attending Le Congrès Mondial Acadien in Nova Scotia, endorsed a design by William Cork for a New England Acadian flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wquercus.com/acadie/flag.htm |title=A New England Acadian Flag |access-date=2011-10-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907234058/http://www.wquercus.com/acadie/flag.htm |archive-date=2011-09-07 }}</ref>
