A short time after getting his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from [[UCLA Film School]]—and after his successful thesis film, ''[[The Passion of Martin]]'' had attracted industry attention—Payne got a writing/directing deal with [[Universal Pictures]]. The ensuing screenplay, which was turned down, would ultimately become ''[[About Schmidt]]''.<ref name="NYer-2013"/> He says that he cleared about $60,000, which was enough to fund his simple lifestyle at the time for about five years.<ref name=GreekReporter-video />

Payne has said he sees his talent as being one of learned economy, referring to the essay written by [[Tennessee Williams]] on ''[[The Catastrophe of Success]].''<ref name=THR-Feinberg-Podcast />

Payne received his first [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay]] nomination for ''Election''. [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half stars out of four, praising Witherspoon and Payne, and saying, "...here is a movie that is not simply about an obnoxious student, but also about an imperfect teacher, a lockstep administration, and a student body that is mostly just marking time until it can go out into the world and occupy valuable space".<ref>{{cite web | date=April 30, 1999 | last= Ebert | first= Roger | author-link= Roger Ebert | url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/election-1999 | title=Election Movie Review (1999) | work=RogerEbert.com | access-date= November 27, 2016}}</ref> The film became a cult classic with ''Election'' is ranking #61 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] "100 Funniest Movies" and #9 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s list of the "50 Best High School Movies", while Witherspoon's performance was ranked at #45 on the list of the "100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time" by ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]''.

== Themes ==
Payne's films often revolve around middle-aged or older men who reach a breaking point in their lives, enter into transformative existential crises, and then emerge in the end as changed people, for better or worse. Some unexpected life experience forces the central male figure to "crack" and see the world in a new and surprising way. This theme appears in ''Election'', ''About Schmidt'', ''Sideways'', ''The Descendants,'' and to a lesser extent in ''Nebraska'', via the son, one of two main characters. His movies also tend to involve infidelity, road trips or travel, tragedy, despair, disappointment, and crises of masculinity. He has set many of his films in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], his hometown. His films sometimes include scenes of historical landmarks, black and white photographs, and museums, and he often uses  amateur actors for minor roles.<ref name="NYer-2013"/><ref name=NCC-2013>{{cite web|last=Biga|first=Leo Adam|title=Nebraska Coast Connection Salon Q&A with Alexander Payne: The Filmmaker Speaks Candidly About 'Nebraska,' Casting, Screenwriting and Craft: Alexander Payne in conversation with Nebraska Coast Connection founder Todd Nelson|url=http://leoadambiga.wordpress.com/2013/09/24/nebraska-coast-connection-salon-with-alexander-payne-the-filmmaker-speaks-candidly-about-nebraska-casting-screenwriting-and-craft/|work=Leo Adam Biga|access-date=November 14, 2013|date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>
