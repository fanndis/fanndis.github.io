The poet and scholar [[Ahmad Mohammad Obaid]] traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of "baby [[locust]]" ({{lang-ar|جراد}}) due to the abundance of locusts in the area before settlement.<ref name=UAEI>{{cite web |url = http://www.uaeinteract.com/news/rss-news.asp?ID=24335 |title = How Did Dubai, Abu Dhabi and other Cities Get Their Names?

An early mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the ''Book of Geography'' by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]]-[[Arab]] [[geographer]] [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The [[Venice|Venetian]] pearl merchant [[Gasparo Balbi]] visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (''Dibei'') for its [[pearl hunting|pearling]] industry.<ref name=balbi/>

[[File:Al Fahidi-Fort.jpg|thumb|Al  Fahidi fort in the 1950s]]
Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Longman|year=1990|isbn=978-0582277281|location=UK|pages=238}}</ref> and was, by 1822, a town of some 700–800 members of the [[Bani Yas]] tribe and subject to the rule of [[Tahnun bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan|Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut]] of [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Islands and Maritime Boundaries of the Gulf 1798–1960|last = Schofield|first = R|publisher = Archive Editions|year = 1990|isbn = 9781852072759|location = UK|page = 545}}</ref>

In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the [[House of Al Falasi|Al Bu Falasah]] tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by [[Obeid bin Said bin Rashid|Obeid bin Saeed]] and [[Maktoum bin Butti bin Suhail|Maktoum bin Butti]], who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktum to establish the [[Al Maktoum|Maktoum dynasty]].<ref name=":0"/>

Dubai signed the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820]] along with other [[Trucial States|Trucial State]]s, following the [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1819|British punitive expedition]] against [[Ras Al Khaimah]] of 1819, which also led to the bombardment of the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf. This led to the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Truce. Dubai also – like its neighbours on the [[Trucial States|Trucial Coast]] – entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the [[United Kingdom]] took responsibility for the emirate's security [[Trucial States#Treaty of 1892|in 1892]].

In 1841, a [[smallpox]] epidemic broke out in the [[Bur Dubai]] locality, forcing residents to relocate east to [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]].<ref name="hist_karim">{{cite web |url=http://www.alshindagah.com/september99/architecture.htm |title=Modernity and tradition in Dubai architecture.

The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai, while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|pages=750}}</ref>

[[File:A Round Watchtower (Name Unknown).jpg|thumb|upright|A watchtower in [[Bur Dubai]], c. 19th century]]
In 1901, [[Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum]] established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh,<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|pages=2236}}</ref> but also those who had settled in [[Ras Al Khaimah]] and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through the [[Al-Qasimi|Al Qawasim]] tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|pages=743}}</ref> the steamers called fortnightly – in 1906, trading seventy thousand tonnes of cargo.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|pages=34}}</ref> The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh 'bids fair to become complete and permanent',<ref name=":12" /> and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrepôt of the Trucial States.<ref name="Lorimer 1915 454">{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol II|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|pages=454}}</ref>

The 'great storm' of 1908 struck the pearling boats of Dubai and the coastal emirates towards the end of the pearling season that year, resulting in the loss of a dozen boats and over 100 men. The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinner and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of [[Muscat]] in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|pages=39}}</ref>

In 1910, in the [[The Hyacinth incident|Hyacinth incident]] the town was bombarded by [[HMS Hyacinth (1898)|HMS ''Hyacinth'']], with the loss of 37 killed.

===Pre-oil Dubai===
Dubai's geographical proximity to [[Iran]] made it an important trade location. The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, chiefly those from Iran, many of whom eventually settled in the town. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was an important port.<ref name="britannica"/> At that time, Dubai consisted of the town of Dubai and the nearby village of [[Jumeirah]], a collection of some 45 ''areesh'' (palm leaf) huts.<ref name="Lorimer 1915 454"/> Dubai was known for its [[pearl]] exports until the 1930s; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the 1929 [[Great Depression]] and the innovation of [[cultured pearls]]. With the collapse of the pearling industry, Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents lived in poverty or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf.<ref name="hist_trad"/>

In the early days since its inception, Dubai was constantly at odds with [[Abu Dhabi]].

Despite a lack of oil, Dubai's ruler from 1958, [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure. Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure, including electricity, telephone services and both the ports and airport operators.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Longman|year=1996|isbn=978-0582277281|location=London|pages=260}}</ref> An airport of sorts (a runway built on salt flats) was established in Dubai in the 1950s and, in 1959, the emirate's first hotel, the Airlines Hotel, was constructed.

Sheikh Rashid commissioned John Harris from Halcrow, a British architecture firm, to create the city's first master plan in 1959. Harris imagined a Dubai that would rise from the historic center on Dubai Creek, with an extensive road system, organised zones, and a town center, all of which could feasibly be built with the limited financial resources at the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elshestawy |first1=Yasser |title=Planning Middle Eastern Cities: An Urban Kaleidoscope |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1134410107}}</ref>

1959 saw the establishment of Dubai's first telephone company, 51% owned by IAL (International Aeradio Ltd) and 49% by Sheikh Rashid and local businessmen and in 1961 both the electricity company and telephone company had rolled out operational networks.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley|date=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-0049530058|location=London|pages=245|oclc=152680}}</ref> The water company (Sheikh Rashid was Chairman and majority shareholder) constructed a pipeline from wells at Awir and a series of storage tanks and, by 1968, Dubai had a reliable supply of piped water.<ref name=":5" />

On 7 April 1961, the Dubai-based MV [[MV Dara|''Dara'']], a five thousand ton British flagged vessel that plied the route between [[Basra]] (Iraq), [[Kuwait]] and [[Bombay]] (India), was caught in unusually high winds off Dubai. Early the next morning in heavy seas off Umm al-Quwain, an explosion tore out the second class cabins and started fires. The captain gave the order to abandon ship but two lifeboats capsized and a second explosion occurred. A flotilla of small boats from Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Umm al-Quwain picked up survivors, but 238 of the 819 persons on board were lost in the disaster.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/fifty-years-on-the-tragedy-of-vessel-mv-dara-lingers-1.789262|title=Fifty years on, the tragedy of vessel MV Dara lingers|last=Reporter|first=Mariam M.

Construction of Dubai's first airport was started on the Northern edge of the town in 1959 and the terminal building opened for business in September 1960. The airport was initially serviced by Gulf Aviation (flying Dakotas, Herons and Viscounts) but Iran Air commenced services to Shiraz in 1961.<ref name=":5" />

In 1962 the British [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political Agent]] noted that "Many new houses and blocks of offices and flats are being built... the Ruler is determined, against advice [from the British] to press on with the construction of a jet airport... More and more European and Arab firms are opening up and the future looks bright."<ref name=":2"/>

In 1962, with expenditure on infrastructure projects already approaching levels some thought imprudent, Sheikh Rashid approached his brother in law, the Ruler of Qatar, for a loan to build the first bridge crossing Dubai's creek. This crossing was finished in May 1963 and was paid for by a toll levied on the crossing from the Dubai side of the creek to the Deira side.<ref name=":4" />

BOAC was originally reluctant to start regular flights between Bombay and Dubai, fearing a lack of demand for seats. However, by the time the asphalt runway of Dubai Airport was constructed in 1965, opening Dubai to both regional and long haul traffic, a number of foreign airlines were competing for landing rights.<ref name=":4" /> In 1970 a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai's first [[duty-free shop]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fly Buy Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 2008|isbn = 9789948859437|location = UAE|page = 58}}</ref>

Throughout the 1960s Dubai was the centre of a lively [[gold]] trade, with 1968 imports of gold at some £56 million. This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off [[India]]. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times}}</ref>

In 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce – a healthy markup. Estimates at the time put the volume of gold imports from Dubai to India at around 75% of the total market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Trucial States|first=Donald|last=Hawley|date=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=London|pages=204|oclc=152680|isbn=<!--978-0049530058-->0049530054}}</ref>

===Oil era===
[[File:Dubai Water Canal Business Bay.jpg|thumb|View of [[Business Bay]]]]
After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring [[Abu Dhabi]], oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named 'Fateh' or 'good fortune'. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle easterners. Between 1968 and 1975 the city's population grew by over 300%.<ref name="pop7">{{cite web |url=http://www.ite.org/traffic/documents/AB00H5001.pdf |title=Historic population statistics |accessdate=31 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326030537/http://www.ite.org/traffic/documents/AB00H5001.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009  }}</ref>

As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field, located offshore of the Jebel Ali area of Dubai, two 500,000 gallon storage tanks were built, known locally as 'Kazzans',<ref>{{cite web|url = http://dubaiasitusedtobe.com/pagesnew/ChicagoBeachDubai.shtm|title = How Chicago Beach got its name...then lost it!|accessdate = 20 August 2016|website = Dubai As It Used To Be|last = Chapman|first = Len|url-status=live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160709050015/http://www.dubaiasitusedtobe.com/pagesnew/ChicagoBeachDubai.shtm|archivedate = 9 July 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref> by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop onto the seabed at the Fateh field. These were constructed by the [[Chicago Bridge & Iron Company|Chicago Bridge and Iron Company]], which gave the beach its local name (Chicago Beach), which was transferred to the Chicago Beach Hotel, which was demolished and replaced by the [[Jumeirah Beach Hotel]] in the late 1990s. The Kazzans were an innovative oil storage solution which meant super-tankers could moor offshore even in bad weather and avoided the need to pipe oil onshore from Fateh, which is some 60 miles out to sea.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley|date=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-0049530058|location=London|pages=222|oclc=152680}}</ref>

Dubai had already embarked on a period of infrastructural development and expansion. Oil revenue, flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate's limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990, but had reduced to 7% of GDP by 2004.<ref name=":1"/>

Critically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of [[Port Rashid]], a deep water free port constructed by British company [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow]]. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing. The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed.<ref name=":1"/>

Port Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Father of Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 1999|isbn = 9789948856450|location = UAE|page = 151}}</ref>

===Reaching the UAE's Act of Union===
[[File:Adi with the three rulers of Dubai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adi Bitar]] in a meeting with Sheiks [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Rashid Al Maktoum]], [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammad Al Maktoum]] and [[Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maktoum Al Maktoum]] in Dubai, 1968]]
Dubai and the other '[[Trucial States]]' had long been a British [[protectorate]] where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892, the 'Exclusive Agreement'. This was to change with PM [[Harold Wilson]]'s announcement, on 16 January 1968, that all British troops were to be withdrawn from 'East of Aden'. The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates, together with [[Qatar]] and [[Bahrain]], into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Spirit of the Union|last = Al Maktoum|first = Mohammed bin Rashid|publisher = Motivate|year = 2012|isbn = 9781860633300|location = UAE|pages = 27–39}}</ref>

The principle of union was first agreed between the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah, near Al Semeih, a desert stop between the two emirates.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Spirit of the Union|last = Maktoum|first = Mohammed bin Rashid|publisher = Motivate|year = 2012|isbn = 9781860633300|location = UAE|page = 30}}</ref> The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates, including Qatar and Bahrain, into the union. Over the next two years, negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed -often stormy- as a form of union was thrashed out. The nine-state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where heavy-handed British intervention resulted in a walk-out by Qatar and [[Ras Al Khaimah]].<ref name=":2"/> Bahrain and Qatar dropped out of talks, leaving six of the seven 'trucial' emirates to agree on union on 18 July 1971.<ref>{{Cite book|title=United Arab Emirates: A New Perspective|url=https://archive.org/details/unitedarabemirat00vine|url-access=limited|last=Al Abed|first=Ibrahim|publisher=Trident Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-900724-47-0|location=https://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/06.pdf|pages=[https://archive.org/details/unitedarabemirat00vine/page/n128 129]–133}}</ref>

On 2 December 1971, Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi, [[Sharjah]], [[Ajman]], [[Umm al-Quwain]] and [[Fujairah]] joined in the Act of Union to form the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the UAE on 10 February 1972, following [[Iran]]'s annexation of the RAK-claimed [[Tunbs]] islands.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Islands and International Politics in the Persian Gulf: The Abu Musa and Tunbs in Strategic Context|url=https://archive.org/details/islandsinternati00ahma|url-access=limited|last=Ahmadi|first=Kourosh|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islandsinternati00ahma/page/n106 96]}}</ref>

In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency: the [[United Arab Emirates dirham|UAE dirham]].<ref name="britannica"/> In that same year, the prior [[monetary union]] with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.centralbank.ae/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=148&Itemid=106|title=Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates|access-date=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203063733/http://www.centralbank.ae/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=148&Itemid=106|archive-date=3 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Modern Dubai===

The [[Gulf War]] of 1990 had a negative financial effect on the city, as depositors withdrew their money and traders withdrew their trade, but subsequently, the city recovered in a changing political climate and thrived.

Dubai is situated on the [[Persian Gulf]] coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level ({{convert|16|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} above). The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]] in the northeast, and the [[Sultanate of Oman]] in the southeast. [[Hatta, United Arab Emirates|Hatta]], a minor [[exclave]] of the emirate, is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman (in the west) and Ras Al Khaimah (in the north). The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate. Dubai is positioned at {{Coord|25.2697|N|55.3095|E}} and covers an area of {{convert|1588|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial {{convert|1500|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} designation due to [[Land reclamation#Land amounts added|land reclamation from the sea]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Dubai lies directly within the [[Arabian Desert]]. However, the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country.<ref name=geo1>[http://uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/14.pdf Environmental Development and Protection in the UAE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172707/http://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/14.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }}. Aspinall, Simon</ref> The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine, clean and white. East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as ''[[sabkha]]'', give way to a north–south running line of dunes. Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with [[iron oxide]].<ref name=pop7/>

The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western [[Hajar Mountains]], which run alongside Dubai's border with Oman at Hatta. The Western Hajar chain has an arid, jagged and shattered landscape, whose mountains rise to about {{convert|1300|m|0|abbr=off}} in some places. Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases; however, Dubai does have a natural inlet, [[Dubai Creek]], which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through. Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes, which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains. A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as [[The Empty Quarter]]. [[Seismic]]ally, Dubai is in a very stable zone—the nearest seismic fault line, the Zagros Fault, is {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=off}} from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai.<ref name=seismic>[http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/science/a-straight-line-to-disaster Far enough from the fault lines.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727103103/http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/science/a-straight-line-to-disaster |date=27 July 2012 }} The National, 23 April 2008</ref> Experts also predict that the possibility of a [[tsunami]] in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami.<ref name=seismic/>

[[File:Dubai Creek Harbour 1.jpg|left|thumb|A view of the [[Dubai Creek]] from a harbour]]
The sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms. Desert hyacinths grow in the ''sabkha'' plains east of the city, while acacia and [[prosopis cineraria|ghaf]] trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains. Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and [[neem]] as well as imported trees such as the [[eucalypts]] grow in Dubai's natural parks. The [[houbara bustard]], [[striped hyena]], [[caracal]], [[fennec fox|desert fox]], falcon and [[Arabian oryx]] are common in Dubai's desert. Dubai is on the migration path between Europe, Asia and Africa, and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn. The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish, including the [[hammour]]. The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish, jellyfish, coral, [[dugong]], dolphins, whales and sharks. Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the [[hawksbill|hawksbill turtle]] and [[green turtle]], which are listed as endangered species.<ref>[http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Flora-fauna-of-Dubai-B0odU6b3Lu.html Flora and fauna of Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702064554/http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Flora-fauna-of-Dubai-B0odU6b3Lu.html |date=2 July 2009 }} gowealthy.com</ref><ref>[http://www.uaeinteract.com/nature/default.asp Natural UAE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126010401/http://www.uaeinteract.com/nature/default.asp |date=26 January 2010 }} UAE Interact.

Dubai Creek runs northeast–southwest through the city. The eastern section of the city forms the locality of [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] and is flanked by the emirate of [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] in the east and the town of [[Al Aweer]] in the south. The [[Dubai International Airport]] is located south of Deira, while the [[Palm Deira#The Palm, Deira|Palm Deira]] is located north of Deira in the [[Persian Gulf]]. Much of Dubai's real-estate boom is concentrated to the west of Dubai Creek, on the [[Jumeirah]] coastal belt.

Dubai has been ruled by the [[Al Maktoum]] family since 1833; the emirate is a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Dubai citizens participate in the electoral college to vote representatives to the [[Federal National Council]] of the UAE. The ruler, His Highness Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], is also the Vice-President and [[Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates]] and member of the Supreme Council of the Union (SCU). Dubai appoints 8 members in two-term periods to the [[Federal National Council]] (FNC) of the UAE, the supreme federal legislative body.<ref name=uaegovt>US Library of Congress – Legislative Branches</ref>

The [[Dubai Municipality]] (DM) was established by the then-ruler of Dubai, [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], in 1954 for purposes of city planning, citizen services and upkeep of local facilities.<ref name=dmhistory>Organizational Chart. Dubai Municipality</ref> DM is chaired by [[Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], deputy ruler of Dubai, and comprises several departments such as the Roads Department, Planning and Survey Department, Environment and Public Health Department and Financial Affairs Department. In 2001, Dubai Municipality embarked on an [[e-Government]] project with the intention of providing 40 of its city services through its web portal, [dubai.ae]. Thirteen such services were launched by October 2001, while several other services were expected to be operational in the future.<ref>Dubai Municipality's e-government initiative. Powerpoint. 2 December 2005</ref> Dubai Municipality is also in charge of the city's sanitation and sewage infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wheeler |first=Julia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7663883.stm |title=Raw sewage threat to booming Dubai |publisher=BBC News |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103172040/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7663883.stm |archivedate=3 January 2009 }}</ref>

===Law enforcement===
The [[Dubai Police Force]], founded in 1956 in the locality of [[Naif]], has law enforcement jurisdiction over the emirate. The force is under direct command of Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Dubai and [[Ras al Khaimah]] are the only emirates that do not conform to the federal judicial system of the United Arab Emirates.<ref>On the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Legal System. Gulf-Law.com</ref> The emirate's judicial courts comprise the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Cassation. The Court of First Instance consists of the Civil Court, which hears all civil claims; the Criminal Court, which hears claims originating from police complaints; and [[Sharia|Sharia Court]], which is responsible for matters between Muslims. Non-Muslims do not appear before the Sharia Court. The Court of Cassation is the supreme court of the emirate and hears disputes on matters of law only.<ref name="judicial">UAE Consulate of the United States</ref> 

===Alcohol laws===

Alcohol sale and consumption, though legal, is tightly regulated. Adult non-Muslims are allowed to consume alcohol in licensed venues, typically within hotels, or at home with the possession of an alcohol licence.

Dubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various [[architectural styles]]. Many modern interpretations of [[Islamic architecture]] can be found here, due to a boom in construction and architectural innovation in the Arab World in general, and in Dubai in particular, supported not only by top Arab or international architectural and engineering design firms such as [[Al Hashemi]] and [[Aedas]], but also by top firms of New York and Chicago.<ref>Karim, Luiza [http://www.alshindagah.com/september99/architecture.htm Modernity and tradition in Dubai architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930191053/http://www.alshindagah.com/september99/architecture.htm |date=30 September 2009 }}.

All taxi services are licensed by the RTA. Dubai licensed taxis are easily identifiable by their cream bodywork colour and varied roof colours identifying the operator. Dubai Taxi Corporation, a division of the RTA, is the largest operator and has taxis with red roofs. There are five private operators: Metro Taxis (orange roofs); Network Taxis (yellow roofs); Cars Taxis (blue roofs); Arabia Taxis (green roofs); and City Taxis (purple roof). In addition, there is a Ladies and Families taxi service (pink roofs) with female drivers, which caters exclusively for women and children. There are more than 3000 taxis operating within the emirate making an average of 192,000 trips every day, carrying about 385,000 persons. In 2009 taxi trips exceeded 70 million trips serving around 140.45 million passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/traffic-transport/dubai-metro-gives-boost-to-public-transport-in-city-1.592986|title=Gulfnews: Dubai Metro gives boost to public transport in city|work=Gulf News|date=6 March 2010|accessdate=29 April 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412193111/http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/traffic-transport/dubai-metro-gives-boost-to-public-transport-in-city-1.592986|archivedate=12 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dtc.dubai.ae/ |title=Dubai Taxi Corporation |publisher=Dtc.dubai.ae |date=29 September 2010 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112164616/http://dtc.dubai.ae/ |archivedate=12 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dubai.com/v/cityinfo/#block_1686 |title=Getting Around in Dubai |publisher=dubai.com/ |accessdate=14 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924043220/http://www.dubai.com/v/cityinfo/#block_1686 |archivedate=24 September 2011 }}</ref>

[[Etisalat]], the government-owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Dubai prior to the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC—better known as Du) in 2006.

===Dress code===
The Emirati attire is typical of several countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Women usually wear the "[[abaya]]", a long black robe with a [[hijab]] (the head-scarf which covers the neck and part of the head-all of the hair and ears). Some women may add a [[niqāb|niqab]] which cover the mouth and nose and only leaves the eyes exposed. Men wear the "[[thawb|kandurah]]" also referred to as "dishdasha" or even "thawb" (long white robe) and the headscarf ([[keffiyeh|ghotrah]]). The UAE traditional ghotrah is white and is held in place by an accessory called "[[Agal (accessory)|egal]]", which resembles a black cord. The younger Emiratis prefer to wear red and white ghotras and tie it round their head like a turban.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Healthcare==

Healthcare in Dubai can be divided into two different sectors: public and private. Each Emirate is able to dictate healthcare standards according to their internal laws, although the standards and regulations rarely have extreme differences. Public hospitals in Dubai were first built in the late 1950s and continued to grow with public health initiatives. There are now 28 hospitals in Dubai, 6 public and 22 private, with 3 more major hospitals scheduled to be built by 2025.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uae-expo-2020-bid-in-good-health-dubai-gets-new-hospitals-2013-08-19-1.518053 |title=UAE Expo 2020 bid in good health: Dubai gets new hospitals |date=19 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623003659/http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uae-expo-2020-bid-in-good-health-dubai-gets-new-hospitals-2013-08-19-1.518053 |archivedate=23 June 2015 }}</ref>
