'''Glasgow City Council''' is the [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] authority for the [[Glasgow|City of Glasgow]], Scotland. It was created in 1996 under the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]], largely with the boundaries of the post-1975 City of Glasgow [[Regions and districts of Scotland|district]] of the [[Strathclyde]] region. 

==History==
{{main|Politics of Glasgow}}
The early city, a sub-regional capital of the old [[Lanarkshire]] county, was run by the old "Glasgow Town Council" based at the Tollbooth, [[Glasgow Cross]].<ref>[https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA01062&t=2 Trongate, 1770 (Mitchell Library, Foulis Academy Prints)], The Glasgow Story</ref> In 1895, the Town Council became "The Corporation of the City of Glasgow" ("Glasgow Corporation" or "City Corporation"), around the same time as its headquarters moved to the newly built [[Glasgow City Chambers]] in [[George Square]].<ref>[https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA01186&t=2 City Chambers (Mitchell Library, Glasgow Collection)], The Glasgow Story</ref>

It retained this title until local government re-organisation in 1975, when it became the "[[Glasgow (district)|City of Glasgow District Council]]", a second-tier body under [[Strathclyde Regional Council]] which was also headquartered in Glasgow. Created under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], it included ''the former [[Counties of Scotland|county of the city]] of Glasgow and a number of areas previously within the [[county of Lanark]]: Cambuslang (Central and North, and South lying outwith [[East Kilbride]]), Rutherglen (including the [[burgh]] of Rutherglen), part of a [[Carmunnock]] area (that lying outwith East Kilbride) and [[Baillieston]], [[Carmyle]], [[Garrowhill]], [[Mount Vernon, Glasgow|Mount Vernon]] and [[Springboig]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1973/oct/22/new-local-government-areas|title=New Local Government areas|publisher=[[Hansard]]|date=22 October 1973 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSFG|title= Modern Times: 1950s to The Present Day > Neighbourhoods|author=Irene Maver|website=The Glasgow Story|accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/glasgow/|title=Scotland's Landscape: City of Glasgow|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref>

The city council established in 1996 ([[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]]) was one of the newly created single-tier local authorities, taking on the powers and responsibilities previously divided between the City of Glasgow District and Strathclyde Region bodies, which were abolished, and with boundaries somewhat different from those of the former: the Cambuslang, [[Halfway, Cambuslang|Halfway]], Rutherglen and [[Fernhill, Scotland|Fernhill]] areas (four [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]]) were transferred from the city area to the new [[South Lanarkshire]] council area.

==Council structure==

The council is ceremonially headed by the [[Lord Provost of Glasgow]], who is elected to [[convener|convene]] the council and perform associated tasks as a general civic leader and [[Lord Lieutenant]]; the role has history dating from the 15th century. The current Lord Provost, elected in January 2020, is [[Philip Braat]]<ref name=braat1>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-51226904 New Lord Provost elected to Glasgow City Council], BBC News, 23 January 2020</ref><ref name=braat2>[https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/everything-you-need-know-glasgows-17619589.amp Everything you need to know about Glasgow's new Lord Provost Philip Braat], Glasgow Live, 23 January 2020</ref> with previous incumbent [[Eva Bolander]] (in post from May 2017 to October 2019)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/15292326.Glasgow__39_s_new_Lord_Provost_is_revealed/|title=Glasgow's new Lord Provost is revealed|website=Evening Times}}</ref> having resigned following criticism of her personal 'civic allowance' spending.<ref name=expenses>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-50243192 Glasgow Lord Provost Eva Bolander resigns after expenses row], BBC News, 31 October 2019</ref> 

The council's executive branch is headed by a Leader of the Council, who is the leader of the largest political grouping, currently the [[Scottish National Party]]. The executive committee is usually formed of 19 members across all the elected parties proportionally, however this would have given the SNP a majority of 10 seats despite not gaining one through the election. The Greens proposed an amendment to add an additional seat for each party, making the SNP the biggest minority party.<ref>{{cite web|title=Garscadden/Scotstounhill councillor to oversee all city schools as new minority SNP council takes charge|url=http://www.clydebankpost.co.uk/news/15297838.Garscadden_Scotstounhill_councillor_to_oversee_all_city_schools_as_new_minority_SNP_council_takes_charge/|website=Clydebank Post|accessdate=20 May 2017}}</ref> It was passed and so its composition of 23 seats is currently:<ref>{{cite web|title=Glasgow City Council on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/GlasgowCC/status/865191694815432704|website=Twitter|publisher=Glasgow City Council|accessdate=18 May 2017|language=en}}</ref>

==Elections==
{{main|2017 Glasgow City Council election}}
The council consists of 85 [[councillor]]s elected for a five-year term from 23 [[wards (UK)|wards]]. These wards were introduced for the 2017 election, replacing those introduced in 2007, and each returns three or four members by the [[single transferable vote]] system of election. This system was introduced by the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]],<ref>See also [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2004/20040009.htm ''Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004'', Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) website]</ref> as a means of ensuring a reasonably [[proportional representation|proportionately representative]] outcome.

The most recent full council election took place on [[2017 United Kingdom local elections|Thursday 4 May 2017]]. The [[Scottish National Party]] became the largest party (39) but did not gain an overall majority; [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] returned fewer councillors (31) and lost overall control, with increased numbers for the [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party|Conservatives]] (8) and the [[Scottish Green Party|Greens]] (7).

'''Ward notes''' 
{{notelist}}

== Controversies ==
In July 2020, Private Eye magazine reported a company run by SNP council leader Susan Aitken's husband was one of 11 chosen by the council to be charged £1 per year to rent refurbished shops and that Ms Aitken had not declared any interest related to that.  The Glasgow Times reported the Ethical Standards Commissioner (ESC) office had concluded Ms Aitken had not breached the councillor's code of conduct.  However, Private Eye reported that when their reporter contacted the ESC office for confirmation, they were told the office "could not comment".  

In the same article, Private Eye noted since April 2019, three SNP councillors had quit the party claiming "Aitken is a bully and a dictator".  One of these was Cllr Elspeth Kerr, an SNP member for 30 years, who is quoted as saying "Glasgow city council ... is nothing but a dictatorship. I cannot stand by a party that allows bullying and corruption of this nature".<ref>Private Eye, Issue 1527, p.21</ref>
