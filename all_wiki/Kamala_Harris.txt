Harris also pushed for higher bail for criminal [[defendant]]s involved in gun-related crimes, arguing that historically low [[bail]] encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco.

The program maintained rigorous graduation requirements, mandating completion of up to 220 hours of community service, obtaining a [[High school equivalency degree|high-school-equivalency diploma]], maintaining steady employment, taking parenting classes, and passing drug tests.

In 2006, as part of an initiative to reduce the city's skyrocketing homicide rate, Harris led a city-wide effort to combat [[truancy]] for at-risk elementary school youth in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|title=City opens campaign to cut truancy by thousands of students|url=https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Drive-to-keep-kids-in-school-2680486.php|accessdate=May 1, 2020|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 19, 2004}}</ref> Declaring chronic truancy a matter of public safety and pointing out that the majority of prison inmates and homicide victims are dropouts or habitual truants, Harris's office met with thousands of parents at high-risk schools and sent out letters warning all families of the legal consequences of truancy at the beginning of the fall semester, adding she would prosecute the parents of chronically truant elementary students; penalties included a $2,500 fine and up to a year in jail.<ref name="Knight">{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|title=City trying to get worst truants to school.

In 2008, Harris issued citations against six parents whose children missed at least fifty days of school, the first time San Francisco prosecuted adults for student truancy. San Francisco's school chief, Carlos Garcia, said the path from truancy to prosecution was lengthy, and that the school district usually spends months encouraging parents through phone calls, reminder letters, private meetings, hearings before the School Attendance Review Board, and offers of help from city agencies and social services; two of the six parents entered no plea but said they would work with the D.A.'s office and social service agencies to create "parental responsibility plans" to help them start sending their children to school regularly.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nanette|last=Asimov|title=Citations go to parents of truant kids|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/S-F-cites-parents-of-chronically-truant-kids-3209547.php|accessdate=May 2, 2020|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 11, 2008}}</ref> By April 2009, 1,330 elementary school students were habitual or chronic truants, down 23 percent from 1,730 in 2008, and down from 2,517 in 2007 and from 2,856 in 2006.<ref name="SFGate">{{cite news|title=Fighting truancy yields big dividends|url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Fighting-truancy-yields-big-dividends-3295152.php|accessdate=May 2, 2020|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 14, 2009}}</ref> Harris's office prosecuted seven parents in three years, with none jailed.<ref name="SFGate" />

{{Main|Hollingsworth v. Perry}}

In 2008, California voters passed [[2008 California Proposition 8|Prop{{nbsp}}8]], a state constitutional amendment providing that only marriages "between a man and a woman" are valid. Legal challenges were made by opponents soon after its approval, and a pair of same-sex couples filed a lawsuit against the initiative in [[United States federal courts|federal court]] in the case of ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' (later ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]''). In their 2010 campaigns, California attorney general Jerry Brown and Harris both pledged to not defend Prop{{nbsp}}8.<ref>{{cite news|first=Bob|last=Egelko|url=https://blog.sfgate.com/politics/2010/11/08/kamala-harris-steve-cooley-race-could-affect-prop-8/|title=Kamala Harris-Steve Cooley race could affect Prop. 8|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2020|archive-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608223145/https://blog.sfgate.com/politics/2010/11/08/kamala-harris-steve-cooley-race-could-affect-prop-8/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2011, Harris urged criminal penalties for parents of truant children as she did as District Attorney of San Francisco, allowing the court to defer judgment if the parent agreed to a mediation period to get their child back in school. Critics charged that local prosecutors implementing her directives were overzealous in their enforcement and Harris's policy adversely affected some families.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-truancy-arrests-2020-progressive-prosecutor_n_5c995789e4b0f7bfa1b57d2e|title=The Human Costs Of Kamala Harris' War On Truancy|first=Molly|last=Redden|date=March 29, 2019|website=HuffPost|accessdate=May 25, 2020|archive-date=May 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200525165327/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-truancy-arrests-2020-progressive-prosecutor_n_5c995789e4b0f7bfa1b57d2e|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2013, Harris issued a report titled "In School + On Track", which found that more than 250,000 elementary school students in the state were "chronically absent" and the statewide truancy rate for elementary students in the 2012–2013 school year was nearly thirty percent, at a cost of nearly $1.4{{nbsp}}billion to school districts, since funding is based on attendance rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/tr/truancy_2013.pdf|title=In School + On Track: Attorney General's 2013 Report on California's Elementary School Truancy and Absenteeism Crisis|website=California Attorney General|accessdate=May 25, 2020|archive-date=April 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422013023/https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/tr/truancy_2013.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Law enforcement ====

California's [[2004 California Proposition 69|Prop 69]] (2004) mandated law enforcement to collect DNA samples from any adult arrested for a felony and from individuals arrested for certain crimes. In 2012, Harris announced that the California Department of Justice had improved its DNA testing capabilities such that samples stored at the state's crime labs could now be analyzed four times faster, within thirty days. Accordingly, Harris reported that her Rapid DNA Service Team within the Bureau of Forensic Services cleared California's entire DNA backlog for the first time in history, having developed a process that allowed higher volume analysis of 5,400 evidence samples{{snd}}an increase of 11 percent from 2010 (4,800) and 24 percent from 2009 (4,100).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/01/california-dna-evidence-attorney-general.html|title=California attorney general says DNA backlog is gone|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 25, 2012|access-date=August 19, 2020|archive-date=August 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802232618/https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/01/california-dna-evidence-attorney-general.html |first=Chris |last=Megerian |url-status=live}}</ref> In April 2014, Harris's team was honored with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s Award for Professional Innovation in Victim Services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/04/08/attorney-general-kamala-harris-honored-for-rape-kit-processing/|title=Attorney General Kamala Harris Honored For Rape Kit Processing|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[CBS Sacramento]]|date=April 8, 2014|access-date=August 19, 2020|archive-date=August 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200810211744/https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/04/08/attorney-general-kamala-harris-honored-for-rape-kit-processing/|url-status=live}}</ref> Harris's office would later be awarded a $1.6{{nbsp}}million grant from the [[Manhattan District Attorney]]'s initiative to eliminate the backlogs of untested [[rape kits]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.turlockjournal.com/news/crime/grant-awarded-to-test-rape-kits/|title=Grant awarded to test rape kits|newspaper=[[Turlock Journal]]|date=September 17, 2015|access-date=August 19, 2020|archive-date=June 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200629145222/https://www.turlockjournal.com/news/crime/grant-awarded-to-test-rape-kits/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2014, Harris introduced OpenJustice, a criminal justice data initiative designed with professor [[Steven Raphael]] making available statewide data on arrest rates, deaths in law enforcement custody, arrest-related deaths, and law enforcement deaths.

In April 2015, Harris introduced the first of its kind "Principled Policing: Procedural Justice and Implicit Bias" training, designed in conjunction with [[Stanford University]] psychologist and professor [[Jennifer Eberhardt]], to help law enforcement officers overcome barriers to neutral policing and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the community. All Command-level staff received the training. The training was part of a package of reforms introduced within the California Department of Justice, which also included additional resources deployed to increase the recruitment and hiring of diverse special agents, an expanded role for the department to investigate officer-related shooting investigations and community policing.<ref>{{cite news|title=California Attorney General Launches Top-Down Policing Reforms|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/10493776/california-attorney-general-launches-top-down-policing-reforms|work=[[KQED]]|date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2020|archive-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608223144/https://www.kqed.org/news/10493776/california-attorney-general-launches-top-down-policing-reforms|url-status=live}}</ref> The same year, Harris's California Department of Justice became the first statewide agency in the country to require all its police officers to wear [[body cameras]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/live-updates/general-election/fact-checking-the-first-democratic-debate/harris-on-requiring-police-to-wear-body-cameras/ |title=Harris on requiring police to wear body cameras|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 27, 2019|access-date=August 19, 2020|archive-date=June 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614013255/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/live-updates/general-election/fact-checking-the-first-democratic-debate/harris-on-requiring-police-to-wear-body-cameras/?arc404=true|url-status=live}}</ref> Harris also announced a new state law requiring every law enforcement agency in California to collect, report, and publish expanded statistics on how many people are shot, seriously injured or killed by peace officers throughout the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/10813726/state-to-improve-police-use-of-force-data-next-year-under-new-law-2|title=State to Improve Police Use-of-Force Data Next Year Under New Law|work=[[KQED]]|date=December 30, 2015|access-date=August 19, 2020|archive-date=August 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802185109/https://www.kqed.org/news/10813726/state-to-improve-police-use-of-force-data-next-year-under-new-law-2|url-status=live}}</ref>

Later that year, Harris appealed a judge's order to take over the prosecution of a [[2011 Seal Beach shooting|high-profile mass murder case]] and to eject all 250 prosecutors from the Orange County district attorney's office over allegations of misconduct by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] D.A.

The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] began an investigation into Rackauckas in December 2016, but he was not re-elected.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Saavedra|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2019/02/25/new-orange-county-da-willing-to-undergo-federal-probation-to-end-snitch-investigation/|title=New Orange County DA willing to undergo federal probation to end 'snitch' investigation|date=February 25, 2019|website=Orange County Register|accessdate=May 1, 2020|archive-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608223145/https://www.ocregister.com/2019/02/25/new-orange-county-da-willing-to-undergo-federal-probation-to-end-snitch-investigation/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2016, Harris announced a patterns and practices investigation into purported civil rights violations and use of [[excessive force]] by the two largest law enforcement agencies in [[Kern County, California]], the [[Bakersfield Police Department]] and the [[Kern County Sheriff's Department]].<ref>{{cite news|first1=Oliver|last1=Laughland|first2=Jon|last2=Swaine|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/22/california-police-kern-county-investigation-kamala-harris|title=Two 'deadliest' police departments in US to be investigated in California|date=December 22, 2016|website=The Guardian|accessdate=May 29, 2020|archive-date=May 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200530073210/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/22/california-police-kern-county-investigation-kamala-harris|url-status=live}}</ref>

Labeled the "deadliest police departments in America" in a five-part ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' expose, a separate investigation commissioned by the [[ACLU]] and submitted to the California Department of Justice corroborated reports of police using [[excessive force]]. The ACLU found that officers had engaged in patterns of excessive force{{snd}}including shooting and beating to death unarmed individuals{{snd}}as well as a practice of filing retaliatory criminal charges against individuals subjected to excessive force. Further analysis also revealed the highest rate of police homicides in the country, as well as excessive use of force, resulting in 17 deaths of unarmed civilians from 2009 to 2013 in the form of dog attacks and tasings.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Oliver|last1=Laughland|first2=Jon|last2=Swaine|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/11631037/aclu-report-slams-central-valley-law-enforcement-agencies|title=ACLU says violence at Kern County police departments violated rights|date=November 9, 2017|website=The Guardian|accessdate=May 29, 2020|archive-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608223144/https://www.kqed.org/news/11631037/aclu-report-slams-central-valley-law-enforcement-agencies|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Planned Parenthood ====
In 2016, Harris's office seized videos and other information from the apartment of an antiabortion activist who had made secret recordings and then accused Planned Parenthood doctors of illegally selling fetal tissue. Harris had announced that her office would investigate the activist in the summer of 2015.

In 2011, Harris obtained a guilty plea and a four-year prison sentence from a [[stalker]] who used [[Facebook]] and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] techniques to illegally access the private photographs of women whose social media accounts he hijacked.

<!-- 
Wanda Kagan's account of telling Kamala - her best friend - that she was being abused by her step-father, at 1:15 into the video.
She goes on to describe how Kamala then told her mom, and that her mom then generously invited Kagan to move into their household, 
to finish her final year of high school.  She described Kamala's sister, Maya, also being very gracious in welcoming her, and that
Kamala's mom provided significant help for her to achieve independence from her family.
The clip doesn't say, but my google searches show, Kagan is now a senior Hospital administrator at the Hospital where Kamala's mom worked. -->
