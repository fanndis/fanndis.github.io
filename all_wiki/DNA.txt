DNA and [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) are [[nucleic acid]]s. Alongside [[protein]]s, [[lipids]] and complex carbohydrates ([[polysaccharide]]s), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of [[macromolecule]]s that are essential for all known forms of [[life]].

The two DNA strands are known as [[polynucleotide]]s as they are composed of simpler [[monomer]]ic units called [[nucleotide]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |vauthors= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P |title= Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition= 6th |publisher= Garland |year= 2014 |url= http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |page= Chapter 4: DNA, Chromosomes and Genomes |isbn= 978-0-8153-4432-2 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210549/http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |archive-date= 14 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Purcell |first1=Adam |name-list-style=vanc |title=DNA |url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna|website=Basic Biology |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/ |archive-date=5 January 2017}}</ref> Each nucleotide is composed of one of four [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]s ([[cytosine]] [C], [[guanine]] [G], [[adenine]] [A] or [[thymine]] [T]), a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]], and a [[Organophosphate|phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s (known as the phospho-diester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T and C with G), with [[hydrogen bond]]s to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, [[pyrimidine]]s and [[purine]]s. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.

Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same [[Central dogma of molecular biology#Biological sequence information|biological information]]. This information is [[DNA replication|replicated]] as and when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for [[Primary protein structure|protein sequences]]. The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. [[RNA]] strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], where DNA bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine (T), for which RNA substitutes [[uracil]] (U).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Uracil|title=Uracil|website=Genome.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> Under the [[genetic code]], these RNA strands specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins in a process called [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. Before typical [[cell division]], these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] as [[nuclear DNA]], and some in the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] as [[mitochondrial DNA]] or in [[chloroplast]]s as [[chloroplast DNA]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Russell |first= Peter | name-list-style = vanc | title= iGenetics |url= https://archive.org/details/igenetics0000russ_v6o1 |url-access= registration |publisher= Benjamin Cummings |location= New York |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-8053-4553-1}}</ref> In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]], in [[circular chromosome]]s. Within eukaryotic chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins, such as [[histone]]s, compact and organize DNA. These compacting structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form [[phosphodiester bond]]s between the third and fifth carbon [[atom]]s of adjacent sugar rings. These are known as the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#3&prime;-end|3&prime;-end]] (three prime end), and [[Directionality (molecular biology)#5&prime;-end|5&prime;-end]] (five prime end) carbons, the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a [[glycosidic bond]].  Therefore, any DNA strand  normally has one end at which there is a phosphate group attached to the 5′ carbon of a ribose (the 5′ phosphoryl) and another end at which there is a free hydroxyl group attached to the 3′ carbon of a ribose (the 3′ hydroxyl). The orientation of the 3′ and 5′ carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers [[directionality (molecular biology)|directionality]] (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a [[nucleic acid double helix]], the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]]. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime end (5′ ), and three prime end (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and [[RNA]] is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar [[ribose]] in RNA.<ref name=berg/>

===Nucleobase classification===
The nucleobases are classified into two types: the [[purine]]s, A and G, which are fused five- and six-membered [[heterocyclic compound]]s, and the [[pyrimidine]]s, the six-membered rings C and T.<ref name=berg/> A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, [[uracil]] (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a [[methyl group]] on its ring.

===Grooves===
Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a [[binding site]]. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22&nbsp;[[angstrom]]s (Å) wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12&nbsp;Å wide.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson RE | title = Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 287 | issue = 5784 | pages = 755–58 | date = October 1980 | pmid = 7432492 | doi = 10.1038/287755a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.287..755W | s2cid = 4315465 }}</ref> The width of the major groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove.

===Base pairing===
{{further|Base pair}}

In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[base pair]]ing. Purines form [[hydrogen bond]]s to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair.  DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content. A Hoogsteen base pair is a rare variation of base-pairing.<ref name="pmid23818176">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nikolova EN, Zhou H, Gottardo FL, Alvey HS, Kimsey IJ, Al-Hashimi HM |title=A historical account of Hoogsteen base-pairs in duplex DNA |journal=Biopolymers |volume=99 |issue=12 |pages=955–68 |year=2013 |pmid=23818176 |pmc=3844552 |doi=10.1002/bip.22334 }}</ref> As hydrogen bonds are not [[covalent bond|covalent]], they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily.

{{Anchor|ssDNA}}
As noted above, most DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded ('''dsDNA''') structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart—a process known as melting—to form two single-stranded DNA ('''ssDNA''') molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high [[pH]] (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).

The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC-content (% G,C basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the "melting temperature", which is the temperature at which 50% of the ds molecules are converted to ss molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA. As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chalikian TV, Völker J, Plum GE, Breslauer KJ | title = A more unified picture for the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex melting: a characterization by calorimetric and volumetric techniques | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 14 | pages = 7853–58 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10393911 | pmc = 22151 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.14.7853 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.7853C }}</ref> In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT [[Pribnow box]] in some [[promoter (biology)|promoters]], tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = deHaseth PL, Helmann JD | title = Open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: the mechanism of polymerase-induced strand separation of double helical DNA | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 817–24 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7476180 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02309.x | s2cid = 24479358 }}</ref>

In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break half of the hydrogen bonds, their [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (also called ''T<sub>m</sub>'' value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Isaksson J, Acharya S, Barman J, Cheruku P, Chattopadhyaya J | title = Single-stranded adenine-rich DNA and RNA retain structural characteristics of their respective double-stranded conformations and show directional differences in stacking pattern | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 43 | issue = 51 | pages = 15996–6010 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15609994 | doi = 10.1021/bi048221v | url = http://www.boc.uu.se/boc14www/thesis/johan2005/Paper%20V/Paper%20V.pdf | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610205112/http://www.boc.uu.se/boc14www/thesis/johan2005/Paper%20V/Paper%20V.pdf | archive-date = 10 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

</ref> The sequence on the opposite strand is called the "antisense" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hüttenhofer A, Schattner P, Polacek N | title = Non-coding RNAs: hope or hype? | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 289–97 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851066 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2005.03.007 }}</ref> One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating [[gene expression]] through RNA-RNA base pairing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Munroe SH | title = Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging patterns | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 664–71 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15389973 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20252 | s2cid = 23748148 }}</ref>

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in [[plasmid]]s and [[virus]]es, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having [[overlapping gene]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Makalowska I, Lin CF, Makalowski W | title = Overlapping genes in vertebrate genomes | journal = Computational Biology and Chemistry | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15680581 | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.12.006 }}</ref> In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand.

===Supercoiling===
{{further|DNA supercoil}}
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called [[DNA supercoil]]ing. With DNA in its "relaxed" state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benham CJ, Mielke SP | s2cid = 1427671 | title = DNA mechanics | journal = Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering | volume = 7 | pages = 21–53 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16004565 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.062403.132016 | url = http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ab63/d57290ebf9bc3536fd3f2257a2b509076fc1.pdf }}</ref> If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily.

DNA exists in many possible [[Conformational isomerism|conformations]] that include [[A-DNA]], B-DNA, and [[Z-DNA]] forms, although, only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms.<ref name=Ghosh/> The conformation that DNA adopts depends on the hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal [[ion]]s, and the presence of [[polyamine]]s in solution.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Basu HS, Feuerstein BG, Zarling DA, Shafer RH, Marton LJ | title = Recognition of Z-RNA and Z-DNA determinants by polyamines in solution: experimental and theoretical studies | journal = Journal of Biomolecular Structure & Dynamics | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 299–309 | date = October 1988 | pmid = 2482766 | doi = 10.1080/07391102.1988.10507714 }}</ref>

===Quadruplex structures===
{{further|G-quadruplex}}

At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called [[telomere]]s.

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules.

===Branched DNA===
{{further|Branched DNA|DNA nanotechnology}}

In DNA, [[DNA end#Frayed ends|fraying]] occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Seeman NC | title = DNA enables nanoscale control of the structure of matter | journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–71 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16515737 | pmc = 3478329 | doi = 10.1017/S0033583505004087 }}</ref> Branched DNA can be used in [[nanotechnology]] to construct geometric shapes, see the section on [[#Uses in technology|uses in technology]] below.

===Artificial bases===
{{Main|Nucleic acid analogue}}
Several artificial nucleobases have been synthesized, and successfully incorporated in the eight-base DNA analogue named [[Hachimoji DNA]]. Dubbed S, B, P, and Z, these artificial bases are capable of bonding with each other in a predictable way (S–B and P–Z), maintain the double helix structure of DNA, and be transcribed to RNA. Their existence implies that there is nothing special about the four natural nucleobases that evolved on Earth.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Matthew | last = Warren | name-list-style = vanc |title=Four new DNA letters double life's alphabet | journal = Nature |date=21 February 2019 | doi = 10.1038/d41586-019-00650-8 | pmid = 30809059 | volume=566 | issue = 7745 | page=436| doi-access = free | bibcode = 2019Natur.566..436W }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Hoshika S, Leal NA, Kim MJ, Kim MS, Karalkar NB, Kim HJ, Bates AM, Watkins NE, SantaLucia HA, Meyer AJ, DasGupta S, Piccirilli JA, Ellington AD, SantaLucia J, Georgiadis MM, Benner SA | display-authors = 6 |title=Hachimoji DNA and RNA: A genetic system with eight building blocks (paywall)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=363 |issue=6429 |pages=884–887 |date=22 February 2019 | doi = 10.1126/science.aat0971 | pmid = 30792304 | pmc=6413494 | bibcode=2019Sci...363..884H}}</ref>

===Base modifications and DNA packaging===
{{further|DNA methylation|Chromatin remodeling}}
The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called [[chromatin]]. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of [[methylation]] of [[cytosine]] bases.

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called ''[[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalation]]''. Most intercalators are [[aromaticity|aromatic]] and planar molecules; examples include [[ethidium bromide]], [[acridine]]s, [[Daunorubicin|daunomycin]], and [[doxorubicin]].

==Biological functions==
[[File:Eukaryote DNA-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|Location of eukaryote [[nuclear DNA]] within the chromosomes]]
DNA usually occurs as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and [[circular prokaryote chromosome|circular chromosomes]] in [[prokaryote]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its [[genome]]; the [[human genome]] has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes.<ref name = "Venter_2001"/> The information carried by DNA is held in the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of pieces of DNA called [[gene]]s. [[Transmission (genetics)|Transmission]] of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching [[Peptide sequence|protein sequence]] in a process called [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.

===Genes and genomes===
{{further|Cell nucleus|Chromatin|Chromosome|Gene|Noncoding DNA}}
Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called [[DNA condensation]], to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]], with small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanbichler M, Wang SC, Shapiro L | title = The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 506–21 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]].

Genes contain an [[open reading frame]] that can be transcribed, and [[regulatory sequence]]s such as [[promoter (biology)|promoters]] and [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], which control transcription of the open reading frame.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] encodes protein.

===Transcription and translation===
{{further|Genetic code|Transcription (genetics)|Protein biosynthesis}}
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the [[phenotype]] of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (4<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]], giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.

[[File:DNA replication en.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|right|DNA replication: The double helix is unwound by a [[helicase]] and [[topoisomerase|topo&shy;iso&shy;merase]]. Next, one [[DNA polymerase]] produces the [[Replication fork|leading strand]] copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the [[Replication fork|lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] joins them together.]]

===Replication===
{{further|DNA replication}}

[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's [[complementary DNA]] sequence is recreated by an [[enzyme]] called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Albà M | title = Replicative DNA polymerases | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS3002 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11178285 | pmc = 150442 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3002 }}</ref> In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

==Interactions with proteins==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These [[protein interactions]] can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

===DNA-binding proteins===
{{further|DNA-binding protein}}
[[File:Nucleosome1.png|thumb|260px|left|Interaction of DNA (in orange) with [[histone]]s (in blue). These proteins' basic amino acids bind to the acidic phosphate groups on DNA.]]

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called [[chromatin]].

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Myers LC, Kornberg RD | title = Mediator of transcriptional regulation | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 69 | pages = 729–49 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10966474 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.729 }}</ref> Alternatively, transcription factors can bind [[enzyme]]s that modify the histones at the promoter.

===DNA-modifying enzymes===

====Nucleases and ligases====
[[Nuclease]]s are [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the [[hydrolysis]] of the [[phosphodiester bond]]s. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called [[exonuclease]]s, while [[endonuclease]]s cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect [[bacteria]] against [[Bacteriophage|phage]] infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the [[restriction modification system]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bickle TA, Krüger DH | title = Biology of DNA restriction | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 434–50 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8336674 | pmc = 372918 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.57.2.434-450.1993 }}</ref> In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in [[molecular cloning]] and [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]].

Enzymes called [[DNA ligase]]s can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands.<ref name=Doherty>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doherty AJ, Suh SW | title = Structural and mechanistic conservation in DNA ligases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 28 | issue = 21 | pages = 4051–58 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11058099 | pmc = 113121 | doi = 10.1093/nar/28.21.4051 }}</ref> Ligases are particularly important in [[Replication fork|lagging strand]] DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the [[replication fork]] into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in [[DNA repair]] and [[genetic recombination]].<ref name=Doherty/>

====Topoisomerases and helicases====
[[Topoisomerase]]s are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of [[DNA supercoil|supercoiling]] in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break.<ref name=Champoux/> Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoeffler AJ, Berger JM | title = Recent advances in understanding structure-function relationships in the type II topoisomerase mechanism | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 33 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1465–70 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16246147 | doi = 10.1042/BST20051465 }}</ref> Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.<ref name=Wang/>

[[Helicase]]s are proteins that are a type of [[molecular motor]]. They use the chemical energy in [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s, predominantly [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuteja N, Tuteja R | title = Unraveling DNA helicases. Motif, structure, mechanism and function | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 271 | issue = 10 | pages = 1849–63 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15128295 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04094.x | url = http://repository.ias.ac.in/52775/1/40-pub.pdf }}</ref> These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.

====Polymerases====
[[Polymerase]]s are [[enzyme]]s that synthesize polynucleotide chains from [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. The sequence of their products is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called ''templates''. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ [[hydroxyl]] group at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction.<ref name=Joyce>{{cite journal | vauthors = Joyce CM, Steitz TA | title = Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 177 | issue = 22 | pages = 6321–29 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7592405 | pmc = 177480 | doi=10.1128/jb.177.22.6321-6329.1995}}</ref> In the [[active site]] of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]s make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains. To preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a [[Proofreading (biology)|proofreading]] activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ [[exonuclease]] activity is activated and the incorrect base removed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hubscher U, Maga G, Spadari S | s2cid = 26171993 | title = Eukaryotic DNA polymerases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 71 | pages = 133–63 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12045093 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.090501.150041 | url = http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e941/98efed7eb8fa606b87d9a44c118c235a62e9.pdf }}</ref> In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the [[replisome]] that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the [[DNA clamp]] or [[helicase]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson A, O'Donnell M | title = Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 74 | pages = 283–315 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15952889 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073859 }}</ref>

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include [[reverse transcriptase]], which is a [[virus|viral]] enzyme involved in the infection of cells by [[retrovirus]]es, and [[telomerase]], which is required for the replication of telomeres.<ref name=Greider/><ref name=Tarrago-Litvak1994>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarrago-Litvak L, Andréola ML, Nevinsky GA, Sarih-Cottin L, Litvak S | title = The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1: from enzymology to therapeutic intervention | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 497–503 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 7514143 | doi = 10.1096/fasebj.8.8.7514143 | s2cid = 39614573 | url = http://www.fasebj.org/doi/pdf/10.1096/fasebj.8.8.7514143 }}</ref> For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication.<ref name=Tarrago-Litvak1994/> Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes [[telomeres]] at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.<ref name=Nugent/>

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a [[messenger RNA]] transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, [[RNA polymerase II]], the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large [[protein complex]] with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez E | s2cid = 24946189 | title = Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription | journal = Plant Molecular Biology | volume = 50 | issue = 6 | pages = 925–47 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12516863 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021258713850 }}</ref>

{{further|Genetic recombination}}
[[File:Chromosomal Recombination.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Recombination involves the breaking and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two rearranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).]]

A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells, the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called "[[chromosome territories]]".<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cremer T, Cremer C | title = Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 292–301 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11283701 | doi = 10.1038/35066075 | s2cid = 8547149 }}</ref> This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in [[chromosomal crossover]] which occurs during [[sexual reproduction]], when [[genetic recombination]] occurs.

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of [[natural selection]] and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pál C, Papp B, Lercher MJ | title = An integrated view of protein evolution | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 337–48 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16619049 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1838 | s2cid = 23225873 }}</ref> Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Driscoll M, Jeggo PA | title = The role of double-strand break repair – insights from human genetics | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–54 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16369571 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1746 | s2cid = 7779574 }}</ref>

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is [[homologous recombination]], where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. [[Non-homologous recombination]] can be damaging to cells, as it can produce [[chromosomal translocation]]s and genetic abnormalities.

Methods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms, such as [[phenol-chloroform extraction]], and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as [[restriction digest]]s and the [[polymerase chain reaction]]. Modern [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]] make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology.

The development of forensic science and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible at the time of the original examination. Combined with the removal of the [[double jeopardy]] law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.

DNA profiling is also used successfully to positively identify victims of mass casualty incidents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |title=DNA Identification in Mass Fatality Incidents |date=September 2006 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112000837/http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |archive-date=12 November 2006 }}</ref> bodies or body parts in serious accidents, and individual victims in mass war graves, via matching to family members.

DNA profiling is also used in [[DNA paternity testing]] to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent of a child with the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal [[DNA sequencing]] methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html "Paternity Blood Tests That Work Early in a Pregnancy" New York Times June 20, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624231639/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html |date=24 June 2017 }}</ref>

Late in 1951, [[Francis Crick]] started working with [[James Watson]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] within the [[University of Cambridge]]. In February 1953, [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Robert Corey]] proposed a model for nucleic acids containing three intertwined chains, with the phosphates near the axis, and the bases on the outside.<ref name="pmid16578429">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauling L, Corey RB | title = A Proposed Structure For The Nucleic Acids | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 84–97 | date = February 1953 | pmid = 16578429 | pmc = 1063734 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.39.2.84| url = http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/dna/papers/1953p.9-084.html | bibcode = 1953PNAS...39...84P }}</ref> In May 1952, [[Raymond Gosling]] a graduate student working under the supervision of [[Rosalind Franklin]] took an [[X-ray diffraction]] image, labeled as "[[Photo 51]]",<ref>The B-DNA X-ray pattern [http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/sci9.001.5.html on the right of this linked image] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120525030457/http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/sci9.001.5.html |date=25 May 2012 }}</ref> at high hydration levels of DNA. This photo was given to Watson and Crick by [[Maurice Wilkins]] and was critical to their obtaining the correct structure of DNA. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside. Before then, Linus Pauling, and Watson and Crick, had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards. Her identification of the [[space group]] for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=James | name-list-style = vanc |title=In pursuit of the gene : from Darwin to DNA|url=https://archive.org/details/inpursuitofgenef00schw|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}</ref>

In February 1953, Watson and Crick completed their model, which is now accepted as the first correct model of the double-helix of [[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids|DNA]]. On 28 February 1953 Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime at [[The Eagle, Cambridge|The Eagle]] [[pub]] in Cambridge to announce that he and Watson had "discovered the secret of life".<ref>{{cite book | last = Regis | first = Ed | name-list-style = vanc | date = 2009 | title = What Is Life?: investigating the nature of life in the age of synthetic biology | location = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-19-538341-6 | page = 52 }}</ref>
