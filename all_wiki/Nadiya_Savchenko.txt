During the 2014 [[War in Donbass]] Savchenko, a [[lieutenant|first lieutenant]] in the Ukrainian Ground Forces, served as instructor with a volunteer infantry unit, the [[Aidar Battalion]]. In June 2014, she was captured by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine{{r|rainOR}} and handed over to Russia where she was accused of having directed artillery fire that [[Killing of Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin|killed two Russian state-television journalists]] at the positions of pro-Russian forces in Ukraine.{{r|NewYorker-20160410}}

She was subsequently charged and convicted of murder and illegally crossing Russian state border{{r|TASS-20141107}}{{r|BBC140709}}{{r|NBC140709}} despite being [[Kidnapping|abducted]] from Ukrainian territory one hour before the deaths of the journalists.<ref>According to version by the prosecution, the rebels who captured Savchenko let her go and she crossed Russian border, "[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/72340.html I have right for everything]", by [[Novaya gazeta]]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://meduza.io/feature/2016/03/21/ya-ee-vzyal-i-lichno-peredal-plotnitskomu|script-title=ru:"Я ее взял и лично передал Плотницкому"|last=Azar|first=Iliya|date=21 March 2016|publisher=Meduza.io|language=Russian|accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> One of her lawyers, [[Mark Feygin]], said she was a [[prisoner-of-war]] and called on the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and the [[United Nations]] to demand her immediate release and that of the other Ukrainian [[POW]]s lest Russia be held in violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]].{{r|WP141224}}{{r|NewYorker-20160410}} European Union ministers and their representative regarded her detention as illegal and that her trial did not respect basic [[human rights]], including the right to [[Fair procedure|fair proceedings]].{{r|EEAS-2016}}

In November 2014, while still imprisoned, Savchenko was elected to the Verkhovna Rada in the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], and she formally resigned from her military post.{{r|NSinRda714}}{{r|TASS-20141107}}{{r|NSsp221214}} On 25 May 2016, Savchencko was exchanged in a prisoner swap for Russian [[GRU]] officers<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/russian/russia/2016/05/160525_erofeev_aleksandrov_profile|script-title=ru:Ерофеев и Александров: на кого обменяли Савченко|trans-title=Erofeev and Alexandrov: who was exchanged for Savchenko|language=ru|publisher=Bbc.com|date=25 May 2016|accessdate=25 July 2017}}</ref> Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Alexander Alexandrov captured by Ukraine.<ref name=BBC201605 />

== Life and military career ==
[[File:Nadiya Savchenko.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Savchenko is a Ukrainian military pilot and a former first lieutenant of the Ukrainian Air Force. She resigned after being elected as a member of the Ukrainian parliament.]]
Nadiya Savchenko and her younger sister Vira were born in [[Kyiv]] in the [[Troieshchyna]] neighbourhood.<ref name=RFEpJ16/> Their father was an agricultural engineer, their mother a designer and cargo manager.{{r|RFE140711}} Savchenko's father was a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] while her mother was an [[anti-communist]].<ref name=RFEpJ16/> Her mother and sister Vira said in an interview that she and her sister were brought up in a Ukrainian-speaking household and attending Ukrainian-language schools.{{r|RFE140711}}<ref name=RFEpJ16/>

At 16, Savchenko was already determined to become a pilot. She joined the Ukrainian Army, working as a radio operator with the country's railway forces before training as a paratrooper.{{r|RFE140711}} She was then the only Ukrainian female [[soldier]] in the (2004–2008) [[Multi-National Force – Iraq#2008 withdrawals|Ukrainian peacekeeping troops]] in [[Iraq]]. Upon returning, she successfully petitioned the [[Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)|Defence Ministry]] for the right to attend the prestigious Air Force University in [[Kharkiv]], which until then had been open only to men; she was expelled twice during her study there as unsuitable candidate to train as a pilot but both times was successfully re-instated and continued to train as a flight navigator instead, initially as a SU-24 Navigator and later on a Mi-24 Attack helicopter she graduated in 2009 and served in 3rd Regiment of the Army Aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the city of Brody.
She amassed 170 flying Hours on Mi-24 as navigator.{{r|LP140628}}<ref name=RFEpJ16/>

In 2011, the Ukraine Defence Forces published a 20-minute documentary about Savchenko and her military career.{{r|Youtube-6GWePLY1T-M}} She also featured in a [[United Nations]] Development Program as part of a drive to promote equality in the Ukrainian military.{{r|IBT140712}} Savchenko found her time in Brody boring and often got drunk.<ref name=RFEpJ16/> She was unhappy flying on the [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24]] attack helicopter, instead of fast SU-24 bomber .<ref name=RFEpJ16/> Her former commanding officer at Brody, Edward Zahurskiy, described her as a problem officer, who was unstable, insubordinate, and lacked discipline.<ref name=RFEpJ16/>

In December 2013, Savchenko's 3rd Army Aviation Regiment was ordered to [[Kyiv]] by President [[Viktor Yanukovych]].<ref name=RFEpJ16>{{cite news |url=http://www.rferl.org/fullinfographics/infographics/the-many-faces-of-nadia-savchenko/27869488.html |title=The Many Faces Of Nadia Savchenko |publisher= [[Radio Free Europe]] |date= July 2016 }}</ref> Savchenko then (without permission from her commanding officer) joined the [[Euromaidan]] demonstrations.<ref name=RFEpJ16/> Savchenko kept a low profile during the protests; there is video of trying to persuade demonstrators not to throw petrol bombs at riot police.<ref name=RFEpJ16/> After [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|the president had fled Ukraine in late February 2014]], Savchenko and her unit returned to Brody.<ref name=RFEpJ16/>

Angry over her unit not being deployed in the [[War in Donbass]], Savchenko defied orders and left Brody and she volunteered as an instructor in the [[Aidar Battalion]].{{r|TSN-Save}}<ref name=RFEpJ16/>

==Capture by Donbass People's Militia==
During the [[War in Donbass]], Savchenko fought as a volunteer in the east of Ukraine in the [[Aidar Battalion]].{{r|BBC140709}}{{r|NBC140709}} On 17 June 2014, at 10:46 am she was captured near the village of [[Metalist (Slovianoserbsk Raion)|Metalist]], [[Slovianoserbsk Raion]], by members of the [[Zarya Battalion]], an armed pro-Russian militant group that declared allegiance to the self-declared [[People's Republic of Luhansk]].{{r|KP140701}} On 19 June, a video of her interrogation at an undisclosed location appeared on the internet; she was shown handcuffed to a metal pipe.{{r|BBC140709}}{{r|NBC140709}}{{r|VOU140620}} On 20 June, the chief of counter-intelligence Vladimir Gromov said that Savchenko was being well treated. On 22 June, there were media reports that Savchenko had been transferred to [[Donetsk]].{{r|TSN140622}}

==Detention and trial in the Russian Federation==
[[File:Nadiya Savchenko, Moscow court, 10 February 2015 04.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Savchenko at the [[Moscow City Court|Moscow Basmanny court]] trial (10 February 2015).]]
{{see also|Killing of Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin}}
On 8 July 2014, there were media reports that Nadiya Savchenko was being kept in a detention centre in city of [[Voronezh]], the [[Russian Federation]]. On 9 July, {{Interlanguage link multi|Vladimir Markin (journalist)|ru|3=Маркин, Владимир Иванович|lt=Vladimir Markin}}, spokesman for [[Investigative Committee of Russia|Russia's Investigative Committee]] (a federal agency subordinate to the Russian President), confirmed that Savchenko was indeed held in Voronezh where she was facing charges of complicity in the 17 June killing of two Russian journalists, [[Killing of Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin|Igor Vladimirovich Kornelyuk]] (a correspondent for [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company]]), and sound producer [[Killing of Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin|Anton Voloshin]], who died during a mortar attack on a rebel checkpoint outside Luhansk.{{r|RFE140709}} Ukrainian officials said the reporters did not comply with safety requirements and were not accredited.{{r|BLG140710}} According to Savchenko's defence team, she was alibied by the billing data for Savchenko's and Kornelyuk's mobile phones, provided by [[Security Service of Ukraine|Ukrainian Security Service]], as she had already been captured by the Russian-backed separatists one hour before the mortar attack that killed Russian journalists.{{r|alibi}}

Since late 2015, Russia's Investigative Committee insisted she crossed the border voluntarily without documents, and in the guise of a refugee.{{r|AP140709}} This contradicted previously published evidence and media reports: long before the alleged crossing, Russia's pro-Kremlin TV channel NTV reported that Savchenko had been captured by "rebels" and then handed over to the Russian authorities.{{r|WSJ140710}} Ukrainian officials said she had been illegally taken to Russia by Russian intelligence services in collaboration with pro-Russian rebels.{{r|MFA140709}}{{r|Liga140709}} In 2016, journalist Semen Zakruzhnyi followed the Investigative Committee's alleged route pointing out to numerous inconsistencies and concluding that neither Savchenko nor Russian investigators ever visited the places mentioned in the indictment.{{r|openrussia}}

Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a strong protest against the illegal transfer of Savchenko to Russia, calling the kidnapping of the Ukrainian citizen an act of state terrorism.{{r|IR140708}} On 8 July, President [[Petro Poroshenko]] instructed the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine]] to take all measures to bring about Savchenko's release.{{r|PUA140708}} In response, Vladimir Markin at Russia's Investigative Committee claimed that Savchenko was a terrorist and that the chances of her being released were on a par with those of Petro Poroshenko replacing [[Barack Obama]] as President of the United States.<ref name=TSN140711>{{cite news|url=https://ru.tsn.ua/politika/v-rossii-po-hamski-obyasnili-kogda-osvobodyat-letchicu-nadezhdu-savchenko-376395.html|script-title=ru:В России по-хамски объяснили, когда освободят летчицу Надежду Савченко|trans-title=In Russia, they explained the release of the pilot Nadezhda Savchenko in a crude manner|language=ru|publisher=Tsn.ua|date=11 July 2014|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>

While in captivity she has demonstrated the true, strong, martial Ukrainian spirit of a serviceman who doesn't betray the Motherland."{{r|PUA140710}} The President also said he had ordered a new lawyer for Savchenko.{{r|BLG140710}}

As of 11 July 2015, Savchenko's Russian defence lawyer is [[Mark Feygin]], who is known for his defence of [[Pussy Riot]].{{r|UP140711}} On 27 August 2014, during a hearing at the Sovetsky district court of Voronezh, Savchenko appeared wearing a T-shirt with the Ukrainian state symbol ([[Tryzub]]) and spoke exclusively in the [[Ukrainian language]].{{r|UP140827-voronezh}} She also stated that she had been detained in Russia since 24 June, not 30 June as the Russian investigation reported.{{r|UP140827-voronezh}} At the conclusion of the hearing, the court extended Savchenko's detention for a further two months and ordered that she be sent for a month to the [[Serbsky Institute]] for a forensic psychological evaluation, which Savchenko opposed.{{r|UP140827-psych}}

On 22 December 2014, [[Moscow City Court]] upheld the decision to extend the arrest of Savchenko until the end of the investigation, which was scheduled to be concluded by 13 February 2015.{{r|NSsp221214}} Savchenko subsequently began a [[hunger strike]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oliphant|first1=Roland|title=Nadia Savchenko: The most controversial prisoner of the war in Ukraine |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11337627/Nadia-Savchenko-The-most-controversial-prisoner-of-the-war-in-Ukraine.html|accessdate=11 January 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=11 January 2015}}</ref> The [[European Union]] and the [[United States]] have condemned Savchenko's detention and have called for her release.{{r|IU141018}} Her lawyer, Mark Feygin, said she was a [[prisoner-of-war]].{{r|WP141224}}

Savchenko officially became a Ukrainian delegate to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], or PACE, on 26 January 2015; thus on a legal level, she obtained [[parliamentary immunity]] in all PACE signatory states, including Russia, from that date. Despite this she was not released. [[Aleksey Pushkov]] of the Russian Duma stated that her appointment to PACE was an attack against Russia, and that gaining diplomatic immunity does not absolve one from previous crimes. However, the Russian delegation to PACE struck a different tone, stating that it "fully supports the release of Nadia Savchenko."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.net/politics/1036372-rossiya-ne-sobiraetsya-osvobojdat-savchenko-i-reglament-pase-ey-ne-ukaz.html|publisher=Unian|title=Россия не собирается освобождать Савченко и регламент ПАСЕ ей не указ}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.liga.net/news/politics/4884219-rossiyskaya_delegatsiya_v_pase_v_korne_pomenyala_pozitsiyu_po_savchenko.htm|publisher=Liga|title=Российская делегация в ПАСЕ в корне поменяла позицию по Савченко}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rferl.mobi/a/ukraine-russia-savchenko-pilot-pace-immunity-hunger-strike/26814383.html PACE Grants Savchenko Immunity, Demands Her Release From Russian Jail], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (26 January 2015)<br />{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/246245.html|publisher=[[Interfax Ukraine]]|title=Nadia Savchenko to obtain diplomatic immunity on January 26, Russia will have to let her go}}</ref> PACE has declined to strip Savchenko of her parliamentary immunity, and instead has stated that Savchenko must be immediately released, finding her 2014 abduction and subsequent imprisonment to be "a violation of international law amounting to her de facto kidnapping".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-en.asp?fileid=21538&lang=en |title=Resolution 2034 (2015) Final version: Challenge, on substantive grounds, of the still unratified credentials of the delegation of the Russian Federation |publisher=Council of Europe |date=2015 |accessdate=25 July 2017}}</ref>

On 2 March 2015, President Petro Poroshenko awarded Savchenko with the title of [[Hero of Ukraine]].<ref name=heroia>{{cite news |url=http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/3485964-poroshenko-prysvoyl-savchenko-zvanye-heroia-ukrayny |title=Порошенко присвоил Савченко звание Героя Украины |work=[[Korrespondent]] |date=2 March 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}</ref>

On 24 July 2015, a spokesman for the [[Investigative Committee of Russia]], contrary to the information of Savchenko's capture published earlier by [[Donetsk People's Republic]],<ref name="rainOR" /> stated that she voluntarily crossed the Russian border with intention of committing acts of sabotage and freely moved on the territory of [[Voronezh Oblast]] until 30 June when she was arrested.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russian migration service destroys Savchenko's abduction theory — Markin|url=http://tass.ru/en/russia/810454|agency=[[Russian News Agency TASS|TASS]]|date=24 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Александр Бастрыкин: Яценюк воевал против российской армии в Чечне|url=http://www.rg.ru/2015/09/08/bastrikin-site.html|website=Российская газета|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref>

In February 2016, the [[United States Department of State|US State department]]'s spokesperson [[Jen Psaki]] voiced deep concern over the continued ill-treatment and deteriorating health of Savchenko, and called on Russia to honour its commitments under the September 2014 [[Minsk agreement]]s, and the 15 February implementation plan by immediately releasing Savchenko and other Ukrainian hostages.{{r|Jen Psaki}} Other urges to release her followed.{{r|politolog.net}} On 7 March 2016, US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] protested about Savchenko's continued detention, specifically mentioning concerns about her interrogations, solitary confinement, and forced "psychiatric evaluation".{{r|John Kerry}}
[[File:РОЗЕНБЛАТ БОРИСЛАВ СОЛОМОНОВИЧ VADIM CHUPRINA ©.JPG|thumb|250px|Parliament of Ukraine in April 2015]]
In March 2016, Savchenko wrote: "It is an absurd situation when those who abduct people and subject them to torture then act as if they have a right to judge them! How can one talk about a fair trial? In Russia, there are no trials or investigations—only a farce played out by Kremlin puppets. [...] those in the world with democratic values ought to learn their history lessons before it's too late and remember that there was a time when Europe was tolerant toward Hitler, and America wasn't decisive enough, and this led to World War II."<ref name=RFE160304/>

On 10 March 2016, while on a hunger strike, Nadiya Savchenko made a last statement to the court, which included the statement: "I admit no guilt and I recognize neither the court nor the verdict. If I am found guilty, I will not appeal. I want the entire democratic world to understand that Russia is a Third World country with a totalitarian regime and a petty tyrant for a dictator and it spits on international law and human rights."{{r|NewYorker-20160410}}

According to her lawyer [[Mark Feygin]], "her case will certainly be decided in Kremlin by [[Putin]] and his associates".{{r|alibi}} On 21 March 2016, the court of [[Donetsk, Russia]] found Savchenko guilty of illegally crossing the Russian border and the murder of two Russian journalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tass.ru/en/world/863897 |title=Ukrainian army ex-pilot found guilty of death of Russian journalists near Lugansk — court |publisher=Tass.ru |date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=25 July 2017}}</ref>

==Political career==
[[File:Савченко Надія Вікторівна.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Savchenko in [[Verkhovna Rada|Parliament of Ukraine]], 31 May 2016]]
In the October [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], Savchenko was placed first on the party list of [[Batkivshchyna]].{{r|KP141013}}{{r|NSmBCEC}} (In a June 2016 interview with ''[[Radio Free Europe]]'', she stated that the party wasn't her first choice, but it "isn't the worst").<ref name=RFEpJ16/> In this same election, her sister Vira Savchenko was also a candidate for Batkivshchyna in an [[electoral constituency]] in [[Yahotyn]].{{r|KP141008}}{{r|resultsOkurs1498}} Nadiya Savchenko was elected as a deputy to the [[Verkhovna Rada]], the parliament of Ukraine, as a result of the election.{{r|IU141119}} Because of this Savchenko resigned from the Ukrainian army on 7 November 2014.{{r|TASS-20141107}} The Russian government has recognized the elections of Ukraine, meaning that the Russian Federation was holding a member of parliament from another nation under arrest.{{r|RV141028}}{{r|TASS-20141107}} Vira Savchenko finished third in her constituency with 7.02% of the votes (winner {{Interlanguage link multi|Serhiy Mishchenko|uk|3=Міщенко Сергій Григорович}} won 40.41%) and was thus not elected.{{r|resultsOkurs1498}}

In late November 2014, Savchenko signed her parliamentary oath and passed it to Ukraine through her lawyer and was thus sworn in as [[People's Deputy of Ukraine]] (MP) on 27 November 2014.{{r|NSinRda714}}{{r|Rada-Bio}}

On 25 December 2014, Savchenko was included in Ukraine's quota for representatives in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE); as noted above, legally this granted her [[parliamentary immunity]] in all PACE signatory nations, including Russia.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/241787.html Verkhovna Rada includes pilot Savchenko in PACE delegation], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (25 December 2014)</ref>

==Political views==
Savchenko believes that Ukraine should become "more or less a dictatorship" with a strong leader to stand up to Russia and win,<ref name="article34144815">[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/nadiya-savchenko/article34144815/ Freed from Putin's Russia, a Ukrainian pilot puts Poroshenko and his party – ‘enemy No. 2’ – in her sights], [[The Globe and Mail]] (28 February 2017)</ref> with [[Augusto Pinochet]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Angela Merkel]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Nelson Mandela]] as examples.<ref name="article34144815"/> 
Savchenko has suggested Ukraine should accept the [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea]] as an attempt to end the [[War in Donbass]].<ref name="article34144815"/>

On 15 March 2018, Savchenko claimed that "people now lawmakers" were involved with the [[List of people killed during Euromaidan|deadly sniper shootings]] during the [[2014 Ukrainian Revolution]] and that the government that came to power after the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution did not want to fully investigate these shootings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-savchenko-terror-plot-accusations/29101770.html|title='War Hero' Savchenko Accused Of Terror Plot|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>

After news of her arrest was reported on 19 June, Savchenko became the subject of an impassioned Ukrainian [[social media]] campaign portraying her as a [[Folk hero|national hero]].{{r|BBC140711}} This social media campaign used the [[hashtag]] #SaveOurGirl (that mid-July 2014 had generated more than 15,000 [[Tweet (Twitter)|tweets]]); apparently inspired by the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls used in the May 2014 [[Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping]] social media worldwide campaign.{{r|BBC140711}}

According to [[BBC News]], Savchenko is portrayed extremely negatively in the [[media of Russia]]: "Crude, and at times sexist, innuendo is used to demonise Ms Savchenko".{{r|BBC140711}} The Russian daily ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' said that Savchenko is known as a "killing machine in a skirt", and Tvoy Den called her "Satan's daughter".{{r|BBC140711}} Russian social media, however, tends to be more nuanced towards her with several anti-Kremlin users mocking perceived oddities in the Russian authorities' version of events, in particular their claim that she entered the country as a refugee.{{r|BBC140711}} In March 2016, Russian composer [[Vladimir Nazarov (musician)|Vladimir Nazarov]] wrote in an open letter to Putin saying that "not even in my worst nightmare could I have imagined that I would have to ask you not to kill a woman."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvrain.ru/articles/nazarov-405042/|script-title=ru:'В страшном кошмаре не мог представить, что буду просить вас не убивать женщину'|trans-title=In the most terrible nightmare I could not imagine that I would ask you not to kill a woman|language=ru|website=tvrain.ru|date=8 March 2016|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref> In March 2016, Russian opposition politician [[Alexei Navalny]] stated about Savchenko's trial, "However you look at it, this doesn't benefit Russia".<ref name="BBCanas24316"/> Navalny said that whoever planned to make Savchenko "a trophy prisoner" had miscalculated.<ref name="BBCanas24316"/> He described the trial as such an "obvious stitch-up" you could "see the threads".<ref name="BBCanas24316">{{cite news|last=Rainsford|first=Sarah|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35886684|title=Savchenko case: Will Kremlin release Ukraine pilot?|work=[[BBC News]]|date=24 March 2016|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>

When Savchencko was released from Russian prison in May 2016, [[Opinion polling for the Ukrainian presidential election, 2019|opinion polls for the Ukrainian presidential election]] showed 15% would vote for her; by early 2017, this number was below 5%.<ref name="article34144815"/> Savchenko blames an alleged government smear campaign (that is casting her as someone who may have been turned into a Russian agent) for this collapse.<ref name="article34144815"/>
