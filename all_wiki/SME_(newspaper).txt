In reaction, a major part of the editorial board, including the editor-in-chief, announced their resignation. ''"We are leaving SME and we will try to create a new medium that no one will suspect that it serves someone other than the readers"'', stated Matúš Kostolný, the departing editor-in-chief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/penta-se-nedala-odradit-vstoupila-do-slovenskeho-deniku-sme/r~249a355253b211e4b57a0025900fea04/|title=Penta se nedala odradit.
