==History==
===Origins===
Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning a [[streaming television]] service, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with various [[television studio]]s and programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.<ref name=Leswing>{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/apples-eddy-cue-blew-tv-deals-2016-7 |title=Apple's arrogance is hurting its big TV plans |last=Leswing |first=Kif |date=July 28, 2016 |access-date=November 1, 2019 |website=[[Business Insider]] |archive-date=October 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031070936/https://www.businessinsider.com/apples-eddy-cue-blew-tv-deals-2016-7 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Goodman" />  Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator, [[Eddy Cue]].<ref name=Leswing />

In October 2016, Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] was reported as saying that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here." He added that Apple has "started focusing on some original content" which he called "a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lieberman|first=David|title=Apple Looks To Buy Original Programming, But How Much Will It Spend?|url=https://deadline.com/2017/01/apple-buy-original-programming-how-much-spend-1201884019/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=November 30, 2017|date=January 12, 2017|archive-date=December 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030646/http://deadline.com/2017/01/apple-buy-original-programming-how-much-spend-1201884019/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Staffing ===
In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps in forming its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents of [[Sony Pictures Television]], Jamie Elricht and Zack van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.<ref name="Goodman">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/apple-tv-business-battles-cable-netflix-hulu-amazon-1015798|title=Apple and All of Its Money Just Got Real About the TV Business|last=Goodman|first=Tim|date=June 21, 2017|access-date=November 9, 2019|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|archive-date=November 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109174211/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/apple-tv-business-battles-cable-netflix-hulu-amazon-1015798|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/06/apple-jamie-erlicht-zack-van-amburg-as-heads-of-programming-sony-tv-1202114604/|title=Apple Taps Sony TV's Zack Van Amburg & Jamie Erlicht As Heads Of Programming|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=June 16, 2017|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=November 30, 2017|archive-date=November 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130083002/http://deadline.com/2017/06/apple-jamie-erlicht-zack-van-amburg-as-heads-of-programming-sony-tv-1202114604/|url-status=live}}</ref> Staff acquisition and financial investments rapidly followed as many additional people were brought on board.

=== Development news reports ===
In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via its [[Apple TV (software)|TV]] application on [[iOS]] and [[tvOS]], rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's application store.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Lucas|last2=Smith|first2=Gerry|last3=Gurman|first3=Mark|date=May 9, 2018|title=Apple Plans to Sell Video Subscriptions Through TV App|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/apple-is-said-to-plan-selling-video-subscriptions-through-tv-app|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117063231/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/apple-is-said-to-plan-selling-video-subscriptions-through-tv-app|archive-date=November 17, 2018|access-date=November 16, 2018|website=[[Bloomberg News]]}}</ref>

In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would be distributing their future original content through a still-in-development digital video service to be located within their TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription "channels" from legacy media companies such as [[HBO]] and [[Starz]], which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Alex|date=October 10, 2018|title=Apple plans to give away original content for free to device owners|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/apple-plans-to-give-away-original-content-for-free-to-device-owners.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117105026/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/apple-plans-to-give-away-original-content-for-free-to-device-owners.html|archive-date=November 17, 2018|access-date=November 16, 2018|website=[[CNBC]]}}</ref> Later that month, it was further reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the United States during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months following its initial launch.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Toonkel|first1=Jessica|date=October 23, 2018|title=Apple to Launch TV Subscription Service Globally|url=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-to-launch-tv-subscription-service-globally|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117063256/https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-to-launch-tv-subscription-service-globally|archive-date=November 17, 2018|access-date=November 16, 2018|website=[[The Information (company)|The Information]]}}</ref>

During the announcement of Apple TV+, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] announced a number of prominent names of writers, directors, and stars that will be featured in the service.

Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but with commentators predicting that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases would entice users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.<ref name="Alexander">{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=October 31, 2019|title=Do Apple TV Plus shows have to be good to succeed?|website=[[The Verge]]|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20936686/apple-tv-plus-morning-show-see-mankind-dickinson-price-netflix-disney-streaming|url-status=live|access-date=November 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101011844/https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20936686/apple-tv-plus-morning-show-see-mankind-dickinson-price-netflix-disney-streaming|archive-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Bundel">{{cite news|last=Bundel|first=Ani|date=November 1, 2019|title=Apple TV Plus joins Disney+ in the streaming wars with mediocre shows and lots to prove|website=[[NBCNews.com]]|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/apple-tv-plus-joins-disney-streaming-wars-mediocre-shows-lots-ncna1074946|url-status=live|access-date=November 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191102050315/https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/apple-tv-plus-joins-disney-streaming-wars-mediocre-shows-lots-ncna1074946|archive-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Travers" />

=== COVID-19 pandemic effects ===
On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], and all production on series was postponed for an undetermined period of time.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Clover|first=Juli|date=March 13, 2020|title=Apple Suspends All Active Filming on Apple TV+ Shows|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/13/apple-tv-plus-filming-suspended/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317062058/https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/13/apple-tv-plus-filming-suspended/|archive-date=March 17, 2020|access-date=November 12, 2020|website=[[MacRumors]]}}</ref>

Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed, in part, as buying time for its original content production during the pandemic difficulties, by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new sets of Apple original content are released.<ref name="Mayo19May" /><ref name="Katz" /> 

In addition, the service endeavored to gain new high-profile content, taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic's disruption of theatrical film releases. Among these acquisitions were the 2020 feature film ''[[Greyhound (film)|Greyhound]]'' starring [[Tom Hanks]], which was purchased from Sony for $70 million.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike, Jr.|date=May 19, 2020|title=Tom Hanks WWII Film 'Greyhound' Alters Course In Apple Deal: Film Will Premiere On Apple TV +|url=https://deadline.com/2020/05/tom-hanks-greyhound-apple-tv-wwii-action-film-apple-wins-auction-1202938467/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200519200352/https://deadline.com/2020/05/tom-hanks-greyhound-apple-tv-wwii-action-film-apple-wins-auction-1202938467/|archive-date=May 19, 2020|access-date=May 19, 2020|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war for ''Emancipation'', a slavery-based action-thriller starring [[Will Smith]] and directed by [[Antoine Fuqua]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike, Jr.|date=July 1, 2020|title=Apple Wins 'Emancipation'; Will Smith's Westbrook Relationship With Toppers Zack Van Amburg & Jamie Erlicht At Sony Helped Seal Festival Record Pre-Buy|url=https://deadline.com/2020/07/apple-emancipation-will-smith-antoine-fuqua-record-festival-deal-runaway-slave-peter-scourged-back-photo-william-n-collage-script-1202971626/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200701142448/https://deadline.com/2020/07/apple-emancipation-will-smith-antoine-fuqua-record-festival-deal-runaway-slave-peter-scourged-back-photo-william-n-collage-script-1202971626/|archive-date=July 1, 2020|access-date=July 1, 2020|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights, which will possibly exceed $120 million after all backend deals are completed.<ref name=":0" /> Apple also reportedly considered a $350 to $400 million offer for the rights to stream the [[James Bond]] film ''[[No Time to Die]]'', which was far short of the $650 to $800 million studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] was willing to accept.<ref name="Kit">{{cite web|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|last2=Siegel|first2=Tatiana|date=October 27, 2020|title=Behind MGM's Apple Overture: How Much Is a Bond Movie Worth?|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/behind-mgms-apple-overture-how-much-is-a-bond-movie-worth|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027195740/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/behind-mgms-apple-overture-how-much-is-a-bond-movie-worth|archive-date=October 27, 2020|access-date=October 27, 2020|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelve ''Vital Signs'', a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performer [[Dr. Dre]] and starring [[Ian McShane]], [[Sam Rockwell]], and [[Michael K. Williams]], due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic with moments cited including characters using [[cocaine]], instances of [[gun violence]], and an explicit [[orgy]] scene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach in regards to the company's Worldwide Video Unit with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal tastes, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production have apparently had their content altered including the toning down of the [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] morning show drama series and the removal of [[crucifix]]es from a scene in the [[M. Night Shyamalan]] drama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedian [[Whitney Cummings]] about the #MeToo movement because it was "too sensitive a topic."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mickle|first1=Tripp|last2=Flint|first2=Joe|title=No Sex Please, We're Apple: iPhone Giant Seeks TV Success on Its Own Terms|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-sex-please-were-apple-iphone-giant-seeks-tv-success-on-its-own-terms-1537588880|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=September 24, 2018|date=September 22, 2018|archive-date=September 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923225050/https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-sex-please-were-apple-iphone-giant-seeks-tv-success-on-its-own-terms-1537588880|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Haring|first=Bruce|title=Apple Taking Conservative Approach, Rejects Dr. Dre Streaming Series As Too Violent – Report|url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/apple-taking-conservative-approach-rejects-dr-dre-streaming-series-as-too-violent-report-1202469777/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=September 24, 2018|date=September 24, 2018|archive-date=September 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924011924/https://deadline.com/2018/09/apple-taking-conservative-approach-rejects-dr-dre-streaming-series-as-too-violent-report-1202469777/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Dr. Dre TV series reportedly dumped by Apple due to orgy scene, drug use|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/09/24/dr-dre-tv-series-apple/|website=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=September 24, 2018|date=September 24, 2018|archive-date=September 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924191907/https://ew.com/tv/2018/09/24/dr-dre-tv-series-apple/|url-status=live}}</ref> The Cummings series was ultimately put into development by [[Amazon Video]] in October 2018.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=#MeToo-Themed College Comedy Series From Whitney Cummings & Lee Daniels In Works At Amazon|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/metoo-themed-college-comedy-series-from-whitney-cummings-lee-daniels-in-works-at-amazon-1202474209/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=October 2, 2018|date=October 2, 2018|archive-date=October 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002222933/https://deadline.com/2018/10/metoo-themed-college-comedy-series-from-whitney-cummings-lee-daniels-in-works-at-amazon-1202474209/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Acquisition of back catalog of film and TV content ===
In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with movie and television studios to license their previously released content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non-original movies and television shows for the streaming service.<ref name="Shaw">{{cite news|last1=Shaw|first1=Lucas|last2=Gurman|first2=Mark|date=May 19, 2020|title=Apple Buys Older Shows for TV+, Stepping Up Netflix Challenge|website=[[Bloomberg.com]]|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-19/apple-buys-older-shows-for-tv-stepping-up-netflix-challenge|access-date=May 19, 2020|archive-date=May 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200519150057/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-19/apple-buys-older-shows-for-tv-stepping-up-netflix-challenge|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Mayo19May">{{cite news|last=Mayo|first=Benjamin|date=May 19, 2020|title=Bloomberg: Apple TV+ tops 10 million subscribers, company buying TV show and movie back catalog to expand service|website=9to5Mac|url=https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/19/apple-tv-plus-back-catalog-subscribers/|access-date=May 19, 2020|archive-date=May 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200526151238/https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/19/apple-tv-plus-back-catalog-subscribers/|url-status=live}}</ref> The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries offered by competitors like [[Netflix]], Hulu, and Disney+.<ref name="Shaw" /> This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted.<ref name="Shaw" /><ref name="Mayo19May" />

Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular [[sitcom]]s and well liked movies would help to retain the slowly growing subscriber base, while Apple continues to develop original content.<ref name="Katz">{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Brandon|date=May 19, 2020|title=Apple TV+ Switching Up Its Strategy to Lock Horns With Netflix|website=[[The New York Observer]]|url=https://observer.com/2020/05/apple-tv-plus-buying-old-shows-for-library-netflix/|access-date=May 19, 2020|archive-date=May 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200520145913/https://observer.com/2020/05/apple-tv-plus-buying-old-shows-for-library-netflix/|url-status=live}}</ref> The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services.<ref name="Katz" />

The back catalog development was also seen as a move by Apple to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials was scheduled to expire in November 2020.<ref name="Mayo19May" />
