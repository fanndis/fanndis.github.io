'''Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ae|m|ən|d}}; born 31 December 1954) is a Scottish politician who served as the [[First Minister of Scotland]] from [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007]] to 2014. He was the leader of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) for over 20 years, serving two terms, from 1990 to 2000 and from 2004 to 2014. He was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] between 1987 and 2010, when he stood down to focus on his role as First Minister, and then for [[Gordon (UK Parliament constituency)|Gordon]] from 2015 to 2017, when he lost his seat to [[Scottish Conservative]] candidate [[Colin Clark (politician)|Colin Clark]].<ref name="2017-ge-scotsman">{{cite news|last1=Campsie|first1=Alison|title=Alex Salmond loses his Gordon seat to Conservatives|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/alex-salmond/alex-salmond-loses-his-gordon-seat-to-conservatives-1-4470756|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=9 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609060733/http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/alex-salmond/alex-salmond-loses-his-gordon-seat-to-conservatives-1-4470756|archivedate=9 June 2017}}</ref> During the 2015–2017 parliament, he was the SNP International Affairs and Europe spokesperson in the House of Commons.

From 1987 to 2010, Salmond served as MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]]. Following the establishment of the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1999, Salmond also served as the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Banff and Buchan (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] from 1999 to 2001, continuing to serve as that constituency's MP. Salmond served as the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Gordon (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Gordon]] from 2007 to 2011, and for [[Aberdeenshire East (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeenshire East]] from 2011 to 2016.

Salmond resigned as SNP leader in 2000 and did not seek re-election to the Scottish Parliament. He retained his [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] seat in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]]. Salmond was again elected SNP leader in 2004 and the following year held his Banff and Buchan seat in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]. In 2006 he announced his intention to contest Gordon in the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election]]. Salmond defeated the incumbent MSP and the SNP emerged as the largest single party. After the SNP secured [[confidence and supply]] support from the [[Scottish Green Party]], Salmond was voted First Minister by the Scottish Parliament on 16 May 2007.  During his first term, he headed a minority Scottish Government.  At the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]] the SNP won with an overall majority, a feat previously thought almost impossible under the [[additional member system]] used in elections for the Scottish Parliament.

Politically, Salmond was one of the foremost proponents of [[Scottish independence]], repeatedly calling for a [[Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010|referendum]] on the issue.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/scottish-independence-has-been-a-lifelong-goal-for-alex-salmond-a-991683.html|title=King Alex: The Man Behind Scotland's Independence Movement|accessdate=17 September 2014|location=Hamburg|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|first=Christoph|last=Scheuermann|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919132508/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/scottish-independence-has-been-a-lifelong-goal-for-alex-salmond-a-991683.html|archivedate=19 September 2014|date=17 September 2014}}</ref> Salmond has campaigned on [[global warming]] and in government committed Scotland to legislation on emission reduction and the generation of [[renewable energy in Scotland|renewable energy]]. The day after the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|2014 independence referendum]], at which a majority of Scottish voters rejected independence from the United Kingdom, Salmond announced his intention not to stand for re-election as leader of the SNP at the SNP National Conference in November, and to resign as First Minister thereafter.<ref name="SalmondResigns">{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-29277527|title= Salmond to quit as First Minister|date= 19 September 2014|accessdate= 19 September 2014|publisher= BBC News Scotland|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140919152008/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-29277527|archivedate= 19 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/alex-salmond-to-stand-down-as-first-minister-1-3547344|title=Alex Salmond to stand down as First Minister|work=The Scotsman|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920033043/http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/alex-salmond-to-stand-down-as-first-minister-1-3547344|archivedate=20 September 2014}}</ref> He was succeeded as SNP leader by his deputy, [[Nicola Sturgeon]], the only candidate to stand in the [[2014 Scottish National Party leadership election|leadership election]].

In August 2018, Salmond resigned from the party to fight allegations of sexual misconduct which he denied.<ref name="Guardian 2018-08-29"/> He was charged with 14 offences, including attempted rape and sexual assault, in January 2019, but after trial in March 2020, was acquitted of all charges.

==Early life and career==
Salmond was born in his parents' home at 101 Preston Road, [[Linlithgow]], [[West Lothian]], Scotland, on 31 December 1954.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |last=Black |first=Andrew |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11510394 |title=A profile of SNP leader Alex Salmond |publisher=BBC News Scotland |date=11 January 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114023901/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11510394 |archivedate=14 January 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Torrance|first=David|title=Salmond: Against The Odds|publisher=Birlinn|year=2010|page=12}}</ref> He is the second of four children born to Robert Fyfe Findlay Salmond (1921–2017), and Mary Stewart Salmond ([[née]] Milne; 1922–2003), both of whom were civil servants.<ref name="independentbiography">{{cite news|last=Mullin|first=John|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alex-salmond-the-new-king-of-scotland-889764.html|date=10 August 2008|title=Alex Salmond: The new king of Scotland|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=7 April 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404061106/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alex-salmond-the-new-king-of-scotland-889764.html|archivedate=4 April 2009}}</ref> Robert Salmond, who served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-28158107|title=Alex Salmond's father at HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier ceremony|work=BBC News|date=4 July 2014|accessdate=4 July 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706045409/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-28158107|archivedate=6 July 2014}}</ref> had originally worked as an electrician, and his family had been resident in Linlithgow since the mid-18th century.<ref>Torrance, ''Salmond: Against The Odds'', p. 12</ref> Alex Salmond's middle names come from his family's tradition of naming their children after the local [[Church of Scotland]] minister, in this case the Reverend Gilbert Elliot Anderson of St Ninian's Craigmailen Parish Church in Linlinthgow.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.stninianscraigmailen.org.uk/historybook.pdf|title=St Ninian's Craigmailen Parish Council|year=1975|page=17|accessdate=17 January 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020052405/http://www.stninianscraigmailen.org.uk/historybook.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Speeches/Speeches/First-Minister/genassembly09 |title=General Assembly of the Church of Scotland |publisher=The Scottish Government|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> He remains a member of the Church of Scotland.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6727842.ece |title=Salmond: 'Faith is my driving force' |date=26 July 2009|work=The Sunday Times|accessdate=26 July 2009 |location=London |first=Jason |last=Allardyce}}</ref>

In 1978, he entered the [[Government Economic Service]] as an assistant economist in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, part of the now defunct [[Scottish Office]]. Two years later he joined the staff of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], where he worked for seven years, initially as an assistant economist. In 1982 he was appointed oil economist, and from 1984 he worked as a bank economist as well as continuing to hold the position of oil economist.<ref name="snpbiography"/> While with the Royal Bank, he wrote and broadcast extensively for both domestic and international outlets. He also contributed regularly to oil and energy conferences. In 1983, Salmond created a "Royal Bank/BBC oil index" that is still used.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Political career==

===Early career in politics===
[[File:AlexSalmond 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Salmond speaking at the launch of [[National Conversation|A National Conversation]], 2007]]
Salmond became active in the SNP when he joined the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]] at the University of St Andrews in 1973. His conversion is generally credited to his then girlfriend, Debbie Horton, an English student from London, who was secretary of the St Andrews University Labour club. After an argument in December 1973, she told him: "If you feel like that, go and join the bloody SNP". The next day Salmond did.<ref name="Torrance, Salmond p. 29"/> The following day he and a friend attended the sparsely populated AGM of the university branch of the Federation of Student Nationalists. Being the only two fully paid-up members of the SNP at the university, they were duly elected president and treasurer.<ref name="Torrance, Salmond p. 29"/> Although a [[left-wing]]er at the time he joined, Salmond had considerable doubts as to whether or not the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]] would legislate for a [[Devolution|devolved]] [[Scottish Assembly]].

Salmond started his political life as a committed left-winger inside the SNP and was a leading member of the socialist republican organisation within it, the [[79 Group]]. He was, along with other group leaders, suspended from membership of the SNP when the 79 Group was banned within the larger party. In 1981, he married Moira French McGlashan,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1551133/Moira-Salmond-A-reluctant-First-Wife.html Moira Salmond: A reluctant First Wife] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128140138/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1551133/Moira-Salmond-A-reluctant-First-Wife.html |date=28 January 2012 }}, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 11 May 2007</ref> then a senior civil servant with the [[Scottish Office]].

Following the SNP's National Council narrowly voting to uphold the expulsion, Salmond and the others were allowed back into the party a month later, and in 1985 he was elected as the SNP's Vice Convener for Publicity. In 1987 he stood for Parliament in [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] and defeated the incumbent Conservative MP, [[Albert McQuarrie]]. Later that year Salmond became Senior Vice Convener (Depute Leader) of the SNP. He was at this time still viewed as being firmly on the left of the party and had become a key ally of [[Jim Sillars]], who joined him in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] when he won a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] for the seat of [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in 1988. Salmond served as a member of the [[Energy and Climate Change Select Committee|House of Commons Energy]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]] from 1987 to 1992.

===First tenure as SNP leader===
[[File:A National Conversation launch.jpg|thumb|left|Salmond and Deputy First Minister [[Nicola Sturgeon]] at the launch of the [[National Conversation]]]]
When [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] stood down as SNP leader in 1990, Salmond decided to contest the leadership. His only opponent was [[Margaret Ewing]], whom Sillars decided to support. This caused considerable consternation amongst the SNP left as the two main left leaders were opposing each other in the contest. Salmond went on to win the leadership election by 486 votes to Ewing's 146.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Deacon|first1=Russell|last2=Sandry|first2=Alan|title=Devolution in the United Kingdom|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2007|page=94|isbn=978-0-7486-2416-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WF6A5yF6GukC&q=Alex+Salmond&pg=PA94|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126210516/https://books.google.com/books?id=WF6A5yF6GukC&pg=PA94&dq=Alex+Salmond&hl=en&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Alex%20Salmond&f=false|archivedate=26 January 2016}}</ref>

His first test as leader was the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|general election in 1992]], with the SNP having high hopes of making an electoral breakthrough. Whilst considerably increasing its share of the vote, it failed to win a large number of seats. Sillars lost his, causing him to describe the Scottish people as '90-minute patriots'. This comment ended the political friendship between Salmond and Sillars, and Sillars would soon become a vocal critic of Salmond's style of leadership.

The SNP increased its number of MPs from four to six in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], which saw a [[landslide victory]] for the Labour Party. After election, Labour [[Scotland Act 1998|legislated]] for a devolved Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. Although still committed to a fully independent Scotland, Salmond signed the SNP up to supporting the campaign for devolution, and, along with Scottish Labour leader [[Donald Dewar]] and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader [[Jim Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness|Jim Wallace]], played an active part in securing the victory for devolution in the [[1997 Scotland referendum|Scotland referendum]] of 1997. Many hardline [[SNP Fundamentalist|fundamentalists]] in the SNP objected to committing the party to devolution, as it was short of full political Scottish independence.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Salmond's first spell as leader was characterised by a moderation of his earlier left-wing views and by his firmly placing the SNP into a [[SNP Gradualist|gradualist]], but still pro-independence, strategy. Salmond was one of the few politicians in the UK to oppose the [[NATO]] [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|bombing]] of [[Serbia]] in 1999.<ref>[http://www.siol-nan-gaidheal.com/kosovo.htm SNP News Release 30/03/99 12:06<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024721/http://www.siol-nan-gaidheal.com/kosovo.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref> He was opposed to the conflict because it was not authorised by a [[United Nations Security Council]] [[UN Security Council resolution|resolution]], which was a [[Legitimacy of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|controversial subject at the time]]. Despite this, Salmond was heavily criticised in the media for describing [[Tony Blair]]'s decision to intervene militarily as an "unpardonable folly".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/307225.stm|title=Nato bombing 'unpardonable folly'|work=BBC News|date=29 March 1999|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030202182517/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/307225.stm|archivedate=2 February 2003}}</ref>

Several years as party leader earned Salmond an unusually high profile for an SNP politician in the London-based media. In 1998, Salmond won the Spectator Award for Political Strategist of the Year. Following an appearance on the entertainment programme ''[[Call My Bluff (UK game show)|Call My Bluff]]'', Salmond used one of the 'bluff' cards that are used as props in the show in the run-up to the first elections to the Scottish Parliament. To counter his frustration at having to sit in silence through what he claimed was an inappropriately political speech by Tony Blair at a charity lunch, he held up the bluff card as the Prime Minister began querying Scotland's economic prospects should independence occur.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/news/332686.stm|title=Salmond calls Blair's bluff|work=BBC News|date=1 May 1999|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117141200/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/news/332686.stm|archivedate=17 January 2007}}</ref> Throughout his time in politics, Salmond has maintained his interest in [[horse racing]], writing a weekly column for ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and appearing a number of times on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Morning Line]]''.

===Resignation as leader and subsequent return===
Salmond was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and was one of its highest-profile members. He stood down as SNP leader in 2000, facing internal criticism after a series of high-profile fall-outs with party members,<ref>{{cite news|title=Scramble to lead SNP as Salmond quits|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1349165/Scramble-to-lead-SNP-as-Salmond-quits.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=<!-- Tuesday -->18 July 2000|accessdate=3 February 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219070841/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1349165/Scramble-to-lead-SNP-as-Salmond-quits.html|archivedate=19 February 2012}}</ref> and was replaced by his preferred successor [[John Swinney]], who defeated [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]] for the post. He left the Scottish Parliament in 2001 to lead the SNP group in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

During the prolonged parliamentary debates in the run-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] he voiced strong opposition to the UK's participation. In the aftermath of the war, he lent support to the attempt of [[Adam Price]], a [[Plaid Cymru]] MP, to [[Impeach Blair campaign|impeach Tony Blair]] over the Iraq issue. Salmond has gone further than many anti-war politicians in claiming that Blair's [[September Dossier|statements]] on the presence of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in [[Iraq]] were consciously intended to deceive the public.<ref name = "Iraq"/> He has also claimed that Blair had made a pact with [[George W. Bush]] "to go to war come what may".<ref name="Iraq">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/salmond-back-with-threat-to-impeach-pm-547555.html Salmond back with threat to impeach PM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821003425/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/salmond-back-with-threat-to-impeach-pm-547555.html |date=21 August 2017 }}, ''[[The Independent]]'', 25 September 2004.</ref>

After the [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|June 2004 European Parliament elections]], which were perceived as a "disaster" for the SNP, pressure mounted on Swinney to resign as leader. Swinney announced his resignation on 22 June 2004 to become Convener of the Scottish Parliament's European and External Relations Committee.

On 15 July 2004, Salmond said that he would be a candidate in the forthcoming election for the leadership of the SNP.<ref name="bid">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3895575.stm|title=Salmond launches leadership bid|work=BBC News|date=15 July 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040717021003/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3895575.stm|archivedate=17 July 2004}}</ref> This came as a surprise because he had previously declared that he would definitely not be a leadership candidate.<ref name = "bid"/> In the [[postal ballot]] of all members he went on to receive over 75% of the votes cast, placing him well ahead of his nearest rival [[Roseanna Cunningham]]. As he was not an MSP at the time, his depute, [[Nicola Sturgeon]], took over as leader of the SNP group at Holyrood.<ref name="re-election">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3622728.stm|title=Salmond named as new SNP leader|work=BBC News|date=3 September 2004}}</ref> Although he was re-elected in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], he made clear his intention to return to the Scottish Parliament at the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 Scottish parliamentary election]] in an attempt to win power for the first time.<ref name="re-election"/>

In that election, Salmond stood as a candidate for the [[Gordon (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Gordon]] constituency, which had been represented since 1999 by the Liberal Democrat [[Nora Radcliffe]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4615942.stm|title=Salmond to contest Holyrood seat|work=BBC News|date=16 January 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060126222640/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4615942.stm|archivedate=26 January 2006}}</ref> Salmond won the seat with 41% of the vote, and a majority of 2,062, returning to the Scottish Parliament after six years' absence. In the election the SNP emerged as the largest party, winning 47 seats to Labour's 46.

Having won more seats than any other party in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP initially approached the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] to form a coalition, but they declined to take part in negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6631053.stm|title=Lib Dems rule out SNP coalition|work=BBC News|date=7 May 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923063049/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6631053.stm|archivedate=23 September 2007}}</ref> This left the SNP without any possibility to form a coalition with an overall majority.

====First term====
[[File:Alex Salmond in Spain with Chief Minister.jpg|thumb|right|Salmond (left) is greeted during an official visit to [[Spain]], 2011]]

He gave the post of [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]] to Sturgeon.

Under section 45(7) of the Scotland Act 1998 he became [[Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland]] at the same time.<ref>Scotland Act 1998, section 45(7)</ref>  He was appointed to the [[British Privy Council]] four weeks later.<ref>{{cite web|title=ORDERS APPROVED AT THE PRIVY COUNCIL HELD BY THE QUEEN AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/word/13th%20June%202007.doc|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103140224/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/word/13th%20June%202007.doc|url-status=dead|archivedate=3 November 2010|publisher=[[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]]|location=London|accessdate=2 June 2015|date=13 June 2007|quote=Order appointing Alex Salmond, MP, MSP as a Member of Her Majesty’s Most Honourable Privy Council.}}</ref>

Salmond reduced the size of the [[Cabinet of Scotland|Cabinet]] from nine members to six, and said he would seek to govern on a "policy by policy" basis.<ref name = "first minister"/> In order to concentrate on his new role as First Minister, Salmond stood down as the SNP group leader at Westminster and was replaced by [[Angus Robertson]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/23/houseofcommons.scotland Robertson elected SNP's Westminster leader] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201213736/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/23/houseofcommons.scotland |date=1 December 2016 }}, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 May 2007.</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in November 2007 that Salmond believed Scotland would be independent within "the next decade".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/nov/14/scotland.devolution1 |title=Scotland in 2017 – independent and flush with oil, says Salmond |first=Severin |last=Carrell |date=17 November 2007 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=30 July 2010 |quote=Alex Salmond has predicted that Scotland will win independence from the UK within the next decade ...

A [[white paper]] for an independence referendum, setting out four possible options ranging from no change to full independence, was published by the Scottish Government on 30 November 2009. A draft bill for public consultation was published on 25 February 2010, setting out a two-question yes/no referendum, proposing further devolution or full independence. The SNP failed to obtain support from other parties and withdrew the draft bill.

====UK general election debates====
[[File:Scottish and Northern Ireland Ministers.jpg|thumb|right|Signing of the Joint Agreement between Scotland and [[Northern Ireland]], 2008, with [[Martin McGuinness]] (left) and [[Rev. Ian Paisley]] (centre).]]
Salmond said it would be "unacceptable"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8425622.stm |title=Salmond in SNP debate inclusion call |work=BBC News |date=21 December 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref> for the SNP to be excluded from the [[United Kingdom general election debates, 2010|2010 UK election televised debate]] and sought "guarantees of inclusion from the broadcasters, given their inescapable duty to ensure fairness and impartiality in election-related coverage in Scotland" in the buildup to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 UK general election]]. The party used the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] to see whether the BBC could have broken its own rules. Salmond said it was unacceptable to Scotland as well as to the SNP for the broadcasters to exclude the party that formed the Scottish Government and was leading in Westminster election polls. He emphasised that he was not trying to stop any debates from being broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8425990.stm|title=Legal threats to election debate|work=BBC News|date=22 December 2009|accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> After having failed to change the BBC's decision to not include the SNP in the final British debate, in line with the decision by ITV and Sky News, the SNP mounted a legal challenge to the BBC at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. Despite earlier reassurances by the SNP that it was not trying to stop the broadcast, it sought an 'interim interdict' to prevent the debate being broadcast without the participation of the SNP. The Court of Session dismissed the SNP's complaint, and refused to ban the BBC from broadcasting the third debate in Scotland, on the grounds that the SNP had left the bringing of the case "far too late", had not contested the broadcasting of the first two debates by ITV and Sky Television, and that the third debate would in any case be broadcast by Sky on satellite across Britain, which a Scottish court had no power to block. The judge ordered the SNP to pay the BBC's legal expenses. The SNP's political opponents described the SNP's contesting of the case as a "stunt".<ref>{{cite news|author=|url= http://news.scotsman.com/scottishnationalparty/39Too-late39-Alex-Salmond-loses.6260806.jp |title='Too late' Alex Salmond loses battle with the BBC over debate|work=The Scotsman|date=28 April 2010|accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>

There were Scottish debates dealing with specifically devolved issues which Salmond had accepted the invitation to attend along the other parties within the Scottish Parliament on Sky TV. Salmond declined to attend those held on the BBC and ITV, and Angus Robertson agreed to take his place in the other debates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/election/salmond-happy-with-sky-tv-debate-appearance-1.1019611 |title=Salmond happy with Sky TV debate|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|date=9 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127083756/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/election/salmond-happy-with-sky-tv-debate-appearance-1.1019611|archivedate=27 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Renewable energy====
Salmond in his 2010 New Year message highlighted the importance of [[sustainable development in Scotland|sustainable development]] and [[renewable energy in Scotland]] and the required increase in powers of the Scottish Parliament needed to help harness Scotland's [[green energy]] potential and therefore take full advantage of the "renewable revolution".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8433859.stm |title=Scotland's top politicians outline aims for 2010 |work=BBC News |date=31 December 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>

Earlier, in December 2009, he campaigned for climate change legislation at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|UN Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen to promote Scotland's role in tackling and mitigating [[climate change]]. This included signing a Partnership Agreement with the [[Maldives]], one of the most exposed countries to the consequences of rising sea levels.<ref>{{cite news|title=We can help climate fight: Salmond |agency=Press Association |date=14 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/politics/Alex-Salmond-Our-small-country.5910926.jp |title=Alex Salmond: Our small country can play a big role in climate change fight |publisher=Johnston Press |work=The Scotsman |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=2 February 2014}}</ref>

Although energy is mostly a matter reserved to Westminster, administrative devolution of Sections 36 & 37 of the [[Electricity Act 1989]] coupled with fully devolved planning powers enabled the Scottish Government to establish Scotland as a leader in renewable energy developments.

====Second term====

Before the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 Scottish election]], the SNP again pledged to hold an independence referendum if it won another term.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/243521-snp-launch-manifesto-with-50m-fund-for-young-scots/|title=SNP launch 'Re-elect' manifesto with independence referendum vow|first=Gavin|last=Stuart|publisher=STV|date=14 April 2011|accessdate=17 January 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831091242/http://news.stv.tv/scotland/243521-snp-launch-manifesto-with-50m-fund-for-young-scots/|archivedate=31 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Severin |last=Carrell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/06/snp-election-victory-scottish-independence |title=Stunning SNP election victory throws spotlight on Scottish independence |publisher=Guardian Media Group |work=The Guardian |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=2 February 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205050108/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/06/snp-election-victory-scottish-independence |archivedate=5 December 2013  }}</ref>  The Westminster Labour government had initially designed the additional member system to make it impossible for one party to win an outright majority, but the SNP won enough seats from the other parties to take 69 seats, a majority of four.

===Donald Trump===
Alex Salmond was an early supporter of US President [[Donald Trump]]'s controversial plans for a Trump International golf course in Aberdeenshire. After the plans were rejected by Aberdeenshire council Salmond personally met with Trump Organisation executives in Aberdeen. The next day the decision was made to overrule the council's rejection. The relationship turned fractious when in 2015, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] [[Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd v The Scottish Ministers|rejected Trump's bid to stop an offshore wind farm]] being built close to one of his two golf resorts in Scotland. Trump has twice lost bids in the Scottish courts to halt the development, leading Salmond to describe him as a "three times loser", to which Trump called Salmond a "totally irrelevant has-been".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sherlock|first1=Ruth|title=Donald Trump calls Alex Salmond "totally irrelevant has-been"|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/donald-trump/12055057/Donald-Trump-calls-Alex-Salmond-totally-irrelevant-has-been.html|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126210515/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/donald-trump/12055057/Donald-Trump-calls-Alex-Salmond-totally-irrelevant-has-been.html|archivedate=26 January 2016}}</ref> Salmond has also said that Trump's impact in Scotland – in particular [[Turnberry (golf course)|Turnberry]], the Ayrshire golf resort he bought in 2014 – has had a "damaging impact" on the Scottish economy.<ref name=bbctrump>{{cite news|title=Alex Salmond and Donald Trump in war of words|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35113085|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=BBC News|date=16 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126210520/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35113085|archivedate=26 January 2016}}</ref> These comments came days after the chief executive of the [[Professional Golfer's Association]] said Trump's comments on the presidential campaign trail were "not a positive thing for golf".<ref name=bbctrump/>

In January 2016, Salmond, prompted by broadcasting colleague [[Iain Dale]], called Trump a "chicken" for refusing to appear on his [[LBC]] talk show, which had then been recently launched. Of Trump, he said: "The Donald tries to give this impression that he's totally off the cuff; in fact his media operation controls him and protects him from tough interviews, and when he's had tough interviews he hasn't liked it, that's been pretty obvious".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/14901423.Alex_Salmond__Donald_Trump_is_too_chicken_to_debate/|title=Alex Salmond: Donald Trump is too chicken to debate|work=The National|location=Glasgow|date=21 January 2016|accessdate=11 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111210232/http://www.thenational.scot/news/14901423.Alex_Salmond__Donald_Trump_is_too_chicken_to_debate/|archivedate=11 November 2017}}</ref>

In October 2016, Salmond said Liverpool or Manchester would be an ideal site to rebuild the Houses of Parliament, to make the economy less dependent on London. Salmond has experience of troubled political buildings, having opposed the construction of the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh when cost estimates rose from £50m to £230m in 2000. The eventual cost was £414m.<ref>[http://www.building.co.uk/news/salmond-calls-for-parliament-to-move-north/5084339.arti] {{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref>

In the 2017 UK General Election, Salmond suffered his first defeat as a candidate in any parliamentary election since entering Westminster in 1987, becoming the most high-profile SNP loss of the night. He lost his seat as member for [[Gordon (UK Parliament constituency)|Gordon]] to [[Colin Clark (politician)|Colin Clark]] of the [[Scottish Conservatives|Conservatives]], receiving 19,254 votes to the Conservatives 21,861. This represented a swing of 20.4% away from Salmond, larger than the 14.4% swing to him from the Liberal Democrats which saw him win the seat in the 2015 general election.

This was the first time since the 1987 General Election that Alex Salmond was not in an elected position in the British or Scottish parliaments.<ref name="2017-ge-scotsman"/>

On 30 August 2018, he launched a [[crowdfunding]] appeal to pay for the legal costs of seeking a [[judicial review]] into the fairness of the process by which the Scottish Government has handled the allegations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45350594 |title=Sturgeon's 'huge sadness' as Salmond resigns |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=30 August 2018 |accessdate=30 August 2018 }}</ref> He closed the appeal two days later, on 1 September, after raising £100,000, double the amount he wanted to pay for his legal costs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45367861 |title=Salmond crowdfunder closed after passing £100,000 mark |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=1 September 2018 |accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref> The government later conceded that its procedures had been flawed and paid more than £500,000 in Salmond's legal expenses.<ref name="November" /> On 8 January 2019, he won his inquiry case against Scottish government, noting, "while I am glad about the victory which has been achieved today, I am sad that it was necessary to take this action." The Scottish government admitted it breached its own guidelines by appointing an investigating officer who had "prior involvement" in the case. Salmond also asked permanent secretary to the [[Scottish Government]], [[Leslie Evans]], to consider her position. Evans stated that the complaints the government had received in January 2018 had not been withdrawn, so the option of re-investigating them remained on the table, once the police probe into the allegations had run its course.<ref>{{cite news |title=Alex Salmond wins sexual harassment inquiry case against Scottish government |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46428570 |work=BBC News |date=8 January 2019}}</ref>
