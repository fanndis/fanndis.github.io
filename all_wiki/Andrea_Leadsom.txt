=== Economic Secretary to the Treasury ===
On 9 April 2014 Leadsom was appointed [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]] following [[Maria Miller]]'s resignation from the Cabinet.

Leadsom was instrumental in introducing the UK Government's first Islamic bonds, the [[Sukuk#United Kingdom|Sukuk]]. This was the first Islamic bond listed outside the Islamic world.

According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', her period as City Minister was seen by departmental officials as "a disaster", "the worst minister we ever had. … She found it difficult to understand issues or take decisions.

====Interviews====
In a BBC interview on 7 July 2016, Leadsom spoke of her disappointment about plotting in the leadership race, including alleged attempts by opponents to block her from the final ballot. She dismissed as "ridiculous" accusations that her biography was misleading, saying that her "incredibly varied" CV is "all absolutely true".<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36730216 |title=Tory leadership: Leadsom says CV criticism is 'ridiculous' |date=7 July 2016 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=7 July 2016 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707075202/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36730216 |archive-date=7 July 2016  }}</ref>

==== Alleged exaggeration of pre-government jobs and responsibilities ====
On 6 July 2016 ''[[The Times]]'' and other news media published articles which said that Leadsom had overstated her private sector experience and responsibilities.<ref name="Kenber" /> They said that despite references her supporters had made to her managing "billions of pounds in funds" and her impressive-sounding job titles, she had held financial services regulator approval for only a brief three-month period in 10 years at Invesco Perpetual, and quoted former colleagues who said that she had exaggerated her level of involvement and her management responsibilities.<ref name="indy06072016" /> Bob Yerbury, former Chief Investment Officer at Invesco Perpetual and Leadsom's former manager, dismissed the controversy about how she described her time there and described her as "totally honest".<ref name="Mackintosh" />

"I have not changed my CV," she said. "I was always very clear; I was senior investment officer working very closely with the chief investment officer.

To be very careful not to mislead, Barclays is a very big player in the large corporate and institutional banking world, and so the trading relationships are enormous – billions and billions and billions of pounds.

==== Comments about motherhood ====
Leadsom's comments in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' were interpreted as hinting that her being a mother meant that she was a better choice for Prime Minister than May, who has not been able to have children for health reasons, because it meant that she had "a very real stake" in the future.<ref name="Coates">{{cite news|last1=Coates|first1=Sam|last2=Sylvester|first2=Rachel|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/being-a-mother-gives-me-edge-on-may-leadsom-0t7bbm29x|title=Being a mother gives me edge on May — Leadsom|work=The Times|location=London|date=9 July 2016|access-date=9 July 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref name="graun09072016">{{cite news|last=Sparrow|first=Andrew|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/andrea-leadsom-suggests-she-would-make-better-pm-as-she-has-children|title=Leadsom attacks 'gutter journalism' in row over motherhood quotes|work=The Guardian|date=9 July 2016|access-date=9 July 2016|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708234309/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/andrea-leadsom-suggests-she-would-make-better-pm-as-she-has-children|archive-date=8 July 2016}}</ref> She said that she "did not want this to be 'Andrea has children, Theresa hasn't' because I think that would be really horrible".<ref name="Coates" /> After ''The Times'' published the story, with the headline "Being a mother gives me an edge on May", Leadsom said that she was "disgusted" by the article, which was the "exact opposite of what I said".<ref name="BBC090716">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36752865|title=Andrea Leadsom 'motherhood' comments spark row|publisher=BBC News|date=9 July 2016|access-date=9 July 2016|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709021056/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36752865|archive-date=9 July 2016}}</ref> ''The Times'' later released a partial transcript of the comments, and when Leadsom supporter [[Penny Mordaunt]] said that it was trying to "smear" Leadsom, ''The Times'' released an audio recording.<ref name="BBC090716" />  Her comments were widely criticised<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jul/11/blue-quartets-hostility-to-andrea-leadsom-reduces-her-to-tears|title=Rightwing papers' hostility to Andrea Leadsom reduces her to tears|first=Roy|last=Greenslade|date=11 July 2016|work=The Guardian|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206211950/https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jul/11/blue-quartets-hostility-to-andrea-leadsom-reduces-her-to-tears|archive-date=6 December 2016}}</ref> with fellow Conservative MPs including [[Sarah Wollaston]] and [[Anna Soubry]] suggesting the remarks showed she lacked the judgement to be Prime Minister and calling upon her to withdraw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/leadsom-in-backlash-over-motherhood-remarks-10496432 |title=Leadsom In Backlash Over Motherhood Remarks |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709173413/http://news.sky.com/story/leadsom-in-backlash-over-motherhood-remarks-10496432 |archive-date=9 July 2016  }}</ref> [[Alan Duncan]] described her remarks as "vile".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cowburn|first1=Ashley|title=Andrea Leadsom attacked by Tory MPs over 'vile' and 'insulting' comments on Theresa May's childlessness|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/andrea-leadsom-theresa-may-vile-insulting-children-conservative-leadership-tory-a7128311.html|access-date=11 July 2016|work=The Independent|date=10 July 2016|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710134640/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/andrea-leadsom-theresa-may-vile-insulting-children-conservative-leadership-tory-a7128311.html|archive-date=10 July 2016}}</ref> [[Tim Loughton]], Leadsom's campaign manager for the leadership contest, said that the establishment were ganging up on her.

Her campaign manager, MP Tim Loughton spoke about an "onslaught of often very personal attacks from colleagues and journalists" as well as  "underhand tactics against decent people".<ref name="auto1">{{cite news |last=Booth |first=Robert |date=11 July 2016 |title=How it all went wrong for Andrea Leadsom's leadership bid |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/how-it-all-went-wrong-for-andrea-leadsoms-leadership-bid |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=12 July 2016 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712031052/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/how-it-all-went-wrong-for-andrea-leadsoms-leadership-bid |archive-date=12 July 2016  }}</ref> Leadsom had been under pressure from the news media, with reports criticising her exaggeration of business and management experience<ref name="independent.co.uk" /><ref name="thetimes.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/leadsom-admits-misleading-claims-on-cv-for-top-job-n80lgc2rj|title=Leadsom admits 'misleading' claims on CV for top job|work=The Times|date= 6 July 2016}}</ref> and her suggestion that motherhood strengthened her candidacy for Prime Minister.<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/andrea-leadsom-accused-of-misleading-claims-on-her-cv-a7122296.html|title=Andrea Leadsom accused of 'misleading' claims on her CV|date=6 July 2016|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703030149/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/andrea-leadsom-accused-of-misleading-claims-on-her-cv-a7122296.html|archive-date=3 July 2017}}</ref><ref name="thetimes.co.uk" /><ref name="Sparrow">{{cite news |last=Sparrow |first=Andrew |title=Leadsom attacks 'gutter journalism' in row over motherhood quotes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/andrea-leadsom-suggests-she-would-make-better-pm-as-she-has-children |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=8 July 2016 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708231608/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/andrea-leadsom-suggests-she-would-make-better-pm-as-she-has-children |archive-date=8 July 2016  }}</ref> Leadsom charged ''[[The Times]]'' with "gutter journalism" in response to the article about the motherhood issue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Coates |first=Sam |date=9 July 2016 |title=Being a mother gives me edge on May — Leadsom |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/being-a-mother-gives-me-edge-on-may-leadsom-0t7bbm29x |work=The Times |location=London |access-date=11 July 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Sparrow |first=Andrew |date=8 July 2016 |title=Leadsom attacks 'gutter journalism' in row over motherhood quotes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/andrea-leadsom-suggests-she-would-make-better-pm-as-she-has-children |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=11 July 2016 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160711113434/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/andrea-leadsom-suggests-she-would-make-better-pm-as-she-has-children |archive-date=11 July 2016  }}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' subsequently released the audio tapes of the interview to confirm Leadsom's statement. Although she subsequently apologised "for any hurt I have caused" to [[Theresa May]], she also related that she had felt "under attack, under enormous pressure … It has been shattering."<ref name="auto1" />

Her resignation statement did not touch on either controversy or her personal feelings. Instead, she thanked the 84 MPs who had supported her, conceding that "this is less than 25% of the parliamentary party and ... I do not believe this is sufficient support to win a strong and stable government should I win the leadership election".<ref name="Bulman" /> After her appointment as a Cabinet minister, other comments that Leadsom had made during the leadership race came to light and also led to criticism.

=== Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ===
Following [[Theresa May]]'s cabinet shuffle on 14 July 2016 Leadsom moved from her role as Energy Minister to become [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Andrea Leadsom appointed environment secretary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/14/theresa-may-cabinet-reshuffle-boris-johnson-philip-hammond-rules-out-emergency-budget |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=14 July 2016 |access-date=14 July 2016 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714091607/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/14/theresa-may-cabinet-reshuffle-boris-johnson-philip-hammond-rules-out-emergency-budget |archive-date=14 July 2016  }}</ref>
<br />In April 2017, following the announcement of the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in June, Leadsom was instructed to delay a report of illegally high levels of diesel pollution affecting over half the population until after the election. Constitutional experts Dr Jo Murkens and Colin Talbot agreed it was a health issue and therefore not affected by the election and the government was instructed to appear in the high court to explain the delay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/25/government-delay-air-pollution-plan-due-to-election-dishonest|title=Tories 'on very dodgy ground' over delay of air pollution plan, say experts|author=Matthew Taylor|work=The Guardian|date=25 April 2017|access-date=25 April 2017|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425162945/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/25/government-delay-air-pollution-plan-due-to-election-dishonest|archive-date=25 April 2017}}</ref>

====Criticism of broadcasters====
On the anniversary of the Brexit vote, Leadsom was invited to discuss progress on ''[[Newsnight]]'' and claimed that the government had made "a good start." While being interviewed by [[Emily Maitlis]], Leadsom suggested broadcasters should be "a little more patriotic."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-40386788/brexit-tory-mp-leadsom-says-broadcasters-should-be-patriotic|title=Brexit: Tory MP Leadsom says broadcasters should be patriotic|work=BBC news|date=23 June 2017|access-date=25 June 2017|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625000621/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-40386788/brexit-tory-mp-leadsom-says-broadcasters-should-be-patriotic|archive-date=25 June 2017}}</ref> [[Tim Farron]] described her remarks as "a sinister threat to the free media," a comment echoed by [[Hugo Rifkind]] in ''The Times'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/past-six-days/2017-07-04/comment/we-must-resist-every-assault-on-the-free-press-mltktxjbt|title=We must resist every assault on the free press|author=Hugo Rifkind|work=The Times|date=4 July 2017|access-date=5 July 2017|url-access=subscription }}</ref> whilst ''[[Peston on Sunday]]'' mockingly displayed his patriotism by decorating the studio with [[Union Jacks]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Marsh|first=Sarah|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/25/peston-on-sunday-gives-leadsoms-call-for-patriotism-a-droll-reply|title=Peston on Sunday gives Leadsom's call for patriotism a droll reply|work=The Guardian|date=25 June 2017|access-date=26 June 2016|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625123045/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/25/peston-on-sunday-gives-leadsoms-call-for-patriotism-a-droll-reply|archive-date=25 June 2017}}</ref>

=== Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons ===
[[File:Official portrait of Andrea Leadsom.jpg|left|thumb|241x241px|Leadsom's official parliamentary portrait after being re-elected as the MP for South Northamptonshire]]
On 11 June 2017, Leadsom was appointed [[Lord President of the Council]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]]. In this capacity, in July 2017, while attempting to eulogise [[Jane Austen]], who was about to feature on the new £10 note scheduled to go into circulation in September, Leadsom told the House of Commons: "I would just add one other great lady to that lovely list, who I am delighted to join in celebrating, and that's that of Jane Austen, who will feature on the new £10 note, which I think is one of our greatest living authors." Amid laughs from both benches, she corrected herself, adding: "Greatest ever authors, and I think it's fantastic that at last we are starting to recognize – well I think many of us probably wish she were still living – but I absolutely share the sentiment."<ref name="Austen">{{cite news|work=Leader of Commons refers to face of new £10 note as one of Britain's greatest living authors, causing much mirth among MPs|date= 20 July 2017|title=Unreliable narrator? Andrea Leadsom mistakenly resurrects Jane Austen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/20/andrea-leadsom-jane-austen-britain-greatest-living-author}}</ref>

On 14 January 2019, Leadsom was criticised in the House of Commons by the Speaker of the House, [[John Bercow]] for the failure of the government to advance the cause of [[proxy voting]] for expectant mothers. The issue came to a head due to the imminent caesarean section delivery by [[Tulip Siddiq]] at the time of the rescheduled [[meaningful vote]] on 15 January 2019.<ref>{{cite web|date=14 January 2019|title=John Bercow says it is 'lamentable' that Labour MP forced to postpone birth over crucial Brexit vote|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/news/101109/john-bercow-says-it-%E2%80%98lamentable%E2%80%99-labour-mp-forced}}</ref>

On 31 January 2019, Leadsom said the House of Commons' February [[Recess (parliamentary procedure)|recess]] from 15 to 24 February would be cancelled to free up time to pass the necessary [[Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill|Brexit-related legislation]]. Earlier in the day, her cabinet colleague Jeremy Hunt raised the possibility of Brexit being delayed with a technical extension to Article 50. The Times newspaper reported that senior Government ministers fear that it is already too late to meet the Brexit deadline of 29 March, and that Conservative MPs have been told that a one-line whip is expected to be imposed on votes in the Commons during the week of 18–22 February.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mps-lose-ten-day-break-in-scramble-to-pass-brexit-bill-mdbp0lvqc|title=MPs lose ten-day break in scramble to pass Brexit bill|first=Matt Chorley|last=Red&nbsp;Box&nbsp;Editor|date=31 January 2019|access-date=23 May 2019|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}</ref>

Leadsom resigned as Leader of the House of Commons on 22 May, the eve of the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European elections]], as a result of Theresa May's most recent Brexit proposals, including the offer of votes in the House of Commons on a customs union and a second referendum.

=== Conservative leadership election, 2019 ===
{{main|2019 Conservative Party leadership election}}
On 8 May 2019, Leadsom stated she was "seriously considering" a bid for the party leadership.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Independent |title=Tory leadership race: Andrea Leadsom says she is 'seriously considering' bid to succeed Theresa May |date=8 May 2019 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-leadership-race-andrea-leadsom-theresa-may-brexit-prime-minister-a8904176.html}}</ref>
Leadsom officially announced her candidacy on 25 May, the same day that [[Matt Hancock]] and [[Dominic Raab]] also announced they were running. She was proposed and seconded by fellow MPs [[Chris Heaton-Harris]] and [[Heather Wheeler]]. Leadsom was eliminated from the contest in the first ballot, on 13 June 2019, and came overall in eighth place out of ten candidates.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Stewart|first=Heather|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/13/andrea-leadsom-and-esther-mcvey-out-of-race-to-be-tory-leader|title=Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey out of race to be Tory leader|date=13 June 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=29 February 2020|last2=Walker|first2=Peter|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2019-06-13/andrea-leadsom-out-of-the-tory-leadership-race-but-matt-hancock-gets-through-to-next-round/|title=Andrea Leadsom out of the Tory leadership race but Matt Hancock gets through to next round|website=ITV News|language=en|access-date=29 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/live-conservative-leadership-candidates-face-first-vote-in-race-for-number-10-11740891|title=LIVE: Leadsom, McVey and Harper eliminated in Tory leadership vote|website=Sky News|language=en|access-date=29 February 2020}}</ref>

=== Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ===
On 24 July 2019, Leadsom was appointed [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] by incoming Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]].

On 19 October, she said she was subject to "frightening abuse" from anti-Brexit demonstrators whilst leaving the [[Palace of Westminster]]. [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] and [[Michael Gove]] were also targeted as they left following a House of Commons sitting. Leadsom was given a [[police escort]] through crowds gathered for a [[People's Vote]] rally, who were protesting for a further public vote on Brexit.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/leadsom-gove-and-rees-mogg-targeted-brexit-protesters-9kttg6s9x|title=Andrea Leadsom, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg targeted by Brexit protesters|last=Elliott|first=Francis|date=19 October 2019|work=The Times|access-date=23 October 2019|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>

Leadsom retained her seat with an increased majority at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/constituencies/E14000942|title=Northamptonshire South parliamentary constituency - Election 2019|access-date=9 January 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In May 2020 the environmental law charity [[ClientEarth]] unsuccessfully sued the UK Government after Leadsom approved proposals for the expansion of the gas-fired [[Drax Power Station]] in Yorkshire. According to the charity, the power station could produce 75% of the UK’s energy sector emissions when fully operational and would become the largest gas-fired power station in Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/22/uk-approval-for-biggest-gas-power-station-europe-ruled-legal-high-court-climate-planning|title=UK approval for biggest gas power station in Europe ruled legal|work=The Guardian|date=22 May 2020|access-date=23 May 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref>

She was relieved of her duties as Business Secretary in the [[2020 British cabinet reshuffle]] undertaken by Boris Johnson on 13 February 2020.

==Political views==
Leadsom said in 2016 that she was "absolutely pro-choice" on abortion, but was "keeping an eye on scientific progress which makes foetuses viable earlier". She is concerned about child development, and founded a charity which helps vulnerable mothers to bond with their babies.<ref name="apology">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/10/ive-been-under-attack-its-been-shattering-andrea-leadsom-apologi/|title='I've been under attack, it's been shattering': Andrea Leadsom apologises to Theresa May over motherhood comments and admits furore has left her hurt|work=The Daily Telegraph|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710221154/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/10/ive-been-under-attack-its-been-shattering-andrea-leadsom-apologi/|archive-date=10 July 2016|url-status = live}}</ref> In the [[2016 US Presidential election]] she supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Donald Trump|Trump]]. When seeking the Premiership she said she "absolutely would rule out giving [[Nigel Farage]] [of [[UKIP]]] a job".<ref name=apology/>

She said that if she became Prime Minister she would reform the ban on [[fox hunting]] to ensure greater protections for [[animal welfare]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/andrea-leadsom-fox-hunting-animal-welfare-ban-hunting-act-poll-a7127276.html|title=Andrea Leadsom says she'll bring back fox hunting to improve animal welfare|date=8 July 2016|work=The Independent|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711014302/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/andrea-leadsom-fox-hunting-animal-welfare-ban-hunting-act-poll-a7127276.html|archive-date=11 July 2017|url-status = live}}</ref> Prior to the 2017 election, Leadsom advised Theresa May not to repeat her promise to allow parliamentary time to discuss repealing the hunting ban, but was overruled.<ref name="auto2" />

===Environment===
Before becoming Minister at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, Leadsom had opposed wind farms and EU renewable energy targets. After her appointment she said "When I first came to this job one of my two questions was: 'Is [[climate change]] real?' and the other was 'Is [[hydraulic fracturing]] ["fracking"] safe?' And on both of those questions I am now completely persuaded."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/energy-minister-andrea-leadsom-asked-whether-climate-change-was-real-when-she-started-the-job-a6710971.html|title=New energy minister Andrea Leadsom asked whether climate change was real when she started the job|author=Doug Bolton|date=27 October 2015|work=The Independent|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904052736/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/energy-minister-andrea-leadsom-asked-whether-climate-change-was-real-when-she-started-the-job-a6710971.html|archive-date=4 September 2016|url-status = live|access-date=8 September 2016}}</ref>

As Minister, Leadsom launched the consultation to ban microbeads. Leadsom was personally opposed to microbeads, stating "Most people would be dismayed to know the face scrub or toothpaste they use was causing irreversible damage to the environment, with billions of indigestible plastic pieces poisoning sea creatures. Adding plastic to products like face washes and body scrubs is wholly unnecessary when harmless alternatives can be used."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37263087|title=Plastic microbeads to be banned by 2017|date=3 September 2016|work=BBC News|access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref>

In her role as Secretary of State for the Department for Energy, Food and Rural Affairs, Leadsom stated she was "personally deeply committed to the importance of ensuring clean air".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/25/government-delay-air-pollution-plan-due-to-election-dishonest|title=Tories 'on very dodgy ground' over delay of air pollution plan, say experts|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|date=25 April 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref>

Prior to the 2017 election Leadsom advised Theresa May not to repeat her promise to allow parliamentary time to discuss repealing the hunting ban, but was overruled.<ref name="auto2"/>

===European Union===
In April 2013 at the [[Hansard Society]]'s annual parliamentary affairs lecture, Leadsom warned against the UK leaving the European Union, stating that "I think it would be a disaster for our economy and it would lead to a decade of economic and political uncertainty at a time when the tectonic plates of global success are moving."<ref name="Independenta7116686">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-conservative-leadership-andrea-leadsom-brexit-latest-eu-referendum-disaster-next-leader-a7116686.html|title=Tory leadership contender Andrea Leadsom said leaving EU would be 'disaster' – then campaigned for Brexit|last=Cowburn|first=Ashley|date=3 July 2016|work=The Independent|access-date=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704132517/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-conservative-leadership-andrea-leadsom-brexit-latest-eu-referendum-disaster-next-leader-a7116686.html|archive-date=4 July 2016|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5ec81170-4101-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d.html|title=Andrea Leadsom seeks to play down pro-EU comments|date=3 July 2016|work=Financial Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707023059/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5ec81170-4101-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d.html|archive-date=7 July 2016|url-status = live}}</ref>

However, in 2016 Leadsom campaigned for leave in the UK referendum on European Union membership. ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' reproduced her earlier comments in its issue of 3 July 2016.<ref name="Independenta7116686"/> After her comments were read out by [[Andrew Marr]] on his Sunday morning BBC programme, she explained to Marr how she reached her more recent position: "It has been a journey. When I came into Parliament, like most people in the country I'd grown up as part of the EU and it's absolutely part of our DNA and I came into Parliament, set up something called the Fresh Start Project, which took hundreds and hundreds of hours of evidence about how the EU impacts on the UK – on everything from immigration to fisheries and so on... During that process I travelled all across Europe with lots of parliamentary colleagues – up to 100 Conservative colleagues supporting this work – to try and get a really decent, fundamental reform of the EU."<ref name="Independenta7116686"/> A spokesman for Leadsom said that the recording was "taken completely out of context" because she had opened the lecture by saying that the EU needed major reforms in order for it to be "sustainable". She added that the democratic consent for the EU in Britain was "wafer thin".<ref name="Independenta7116686"/>

==Charity support==
Leadsom was a founder of the Northamptonshire Parent Infant Partnership, a charity providing therapeutic support to help parents bond with their babies who have [[Attachment theory|insecure attachment]], and also founded PIPUK, the national charity for Parent Infant Partnerships which set up branches in four further counties since its inception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pipuk.org.uk/|title=Our Story – pipuk|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712150552/http://www.pipuk.org.uk/|archive-date=12 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norpip.org.uk/About/Trustees.aspx|title=NORPIP:Board of trustees|work=NORPIP Northamptonshire Parent Infant partnership|access-date=2 February 2014|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220120422/http://www.norpip.org.uk/About/Trustees.aspx|archive-date=20 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/27/andrea-leadsom-lobbying-parents-children|title=Andrea Leadsom: lobbying for more support for parents and children|first=Susanna|last=Rustin|date=27 November 2012|work=The Guardian|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826025026/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/27/andrea-leadsom-lobbying-parents-children|archive-date=26 August 2016}}</ref> NORPIP was originally set up with funding from the Ana Leaf Foundation, of which Leadsom's sister Hayley, wife of [[Peter de Putron]], is a trustee.<ref>
