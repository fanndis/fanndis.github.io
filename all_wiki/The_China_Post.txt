'''''The China Post''''' ({{zh|c=英文中國郵報|labels=no}}) was one of three [[English language|English]]-language [[newspaper]]s published in [[Taiwan]] (officially the Republic of China), alongside the ''[[Taipei Times]]'' and the ''[[Taiwan News]]'', which ceased printing in 2010. ''The China Post'' was established by Mr. and Mrs. Y. P. Huang in 1952. <!--According to the publication, its circulation reached{{when|date=October 2020}} over 400,000 readers every day.<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/cp/thechinapost/ The China Post: About The China Post]</ref>-->

In April 2017, ''The China Post'' announced that the print edition of the publication would end, though the website and mobile application would remain active.  

In October 2017, the original China Post website was discontinued and merged with news agency NOWnews. The China Post, however, is still a member of [[Asia News Network]]. Now, it often translates articles from Chinese into English and continues to produce bilingual content. Digging back to its roots, it has also begun to write more original articles. These include opinion articles and analysis articles on a variety of local and international topics. 

==''The Sunday Post''==
''The Sunday Post'' was the Sunday edition of ''The China Post'', featuring comics and a two-page bilingual supplement for advanced [[ESL]] students. ''The Sunday Post'' was the only bilingual weekly publication in Taiwan with a recap of the week's news topics and analysis.
