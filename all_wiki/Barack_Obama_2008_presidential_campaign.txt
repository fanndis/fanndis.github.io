Obama's vice presidential running mate had been a subject of speculation since the end of the primaries. As of August 2008, some of the most popular choices for vice president included, but were not limited to, New York Senator [[Hillary Clinton]], Delaware Senator [[Joe Biden]], Indiana Senator [[Evan Bayh]], Kansas Governor [[Kathleen Sebelius]], Virginia Governor [[Tim Kaine]], retired General and former Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], New Mexico Governor [[Bill Richardson]], and retired General [[Wesley Clark]].

===Financial crisis===

On September 15, 2008 financial services firm [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection, setting off a series of events leading to a 4.4% Dow Jones loss, at the time the largest drop by points in a single day since [[Economic effects arising from the September 11 attacks|the days following]] the attacks on September 11, 2001.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/business/worldbusiness/16markets.html?hp |title=Wall St.'s Turmoil Sends Stocks Reeling |author=Michael Grynbaum |work=The New York Times |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2008-09-15| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411024523/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/business/worldbusiness/16markets.html?hp| archivedate=April 11, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref> That stock market loss was subsequently exceeded by an even larger −7.0% plunge on September 29, 2008.

On September 24, 2008, after the onset of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], McCain announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington to help craft a $700 billion bailout package for the troubled financial industry, and he stated that he would not debate Obama until Congress passed the bailout bill.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obama, McCain Meet In Mississippi|publisher=WAPT |date=December 29, 2008|url=http://www.wapt.com/news/18376597/detail.html|accessdate=December 30, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501071939/http://www.wapt.com/news/18376597/detail.html|archivedate=May 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Despite this decision, McCain was portrayed as not playing a significant role in the negotiations for the first version of the bill, which fell short of passage in the House. He eventually decided to attend the first presidential debate on September 26, despite Congress' lack of immediate action on the bill. His ineffectiveness in the negotiations and his reversal in decision to attend the debates were seized upon to portray McCain as erratic in his response to the economy.

The Obama campaign's fundraising broke previous records for presidential primary and general campaigns, and has changed expectations for future presidential elections. The campaign avoided using public campaign funds, raising all of its money privately from individual donors. By the general election the campaign committee raised more than $650 million for itself, and coordinated with both the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) and at least 18 state-level Democratic committees to create a joint-fundraising committee to raise and split tens of millions of dollars more.<ref name='NYT-Cooper-November 11, 2008'>

By rejecting the funds in favor of private donations, the campaign was in a position to outspend John McCain prior to the election.

===Slogan===
Obama's campaign used the slogan "Change we can believe in" and the [[chant]] "Yes We Can". The latter slogan is shared with the [[United Farm Workers]] and associated with its founder Dolores Huerta and is well known amongst Latinos in its Spanish form [[Sí se puede]]. The "Change we can believe in" has been used in parodies both during and since the campaign. [[John McCain]] attempted to criticize Obama by enumerating various controversial policy positions he allegedly took and proclaiming "that's not change we can believe in" alongside a banner proclaiming McCain as "a leader we can believe in".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIEFUjm3lU John McCain: Speech 06/03/08].

The "{{smallcaps|hope}}" poster was an iconic image of [[Barack Obama]] designed by artist [[Shepard Fairey]].<ref name="Pasick">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/photo/2009/01/15/iconic-obama-poster-based-on-reuters-photo/|title=Iconic Obama poster based on Reuters photo|last=Pasick|first=Adam|date=January 15, 2009|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=January 20, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120032224/http://blogs.reuters.com/photo/2009/01/15/iconic-obama-poster-based-on-reuters-photo/|archivedate=January 20, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It consisted of a stylized [[stencil]] portrait of Obama in solid red, white (actually [[beige]]) and (pastel and dark) blue. Either the words "{{smallcaps|progress}}", "{{smallcaps|hope}}", or "{{smallcaps|change}}" were under the image of Obama (in some versions other words were used). It was created and distributed widely—as a digital image, on posters and other paraphernalia—during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election season]]. Initially it was distributed independently but with the approval of the official Obama campaign. The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign message, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the campaign itself. In January 2009, after Obama had won the election, Fairey's [[mixed-media]] stenciled portrait version of the image was acquired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for its [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]].

===Typefaces===
The signature campaign typeface was [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham]], typically using [[capital letter]]s with occasional use of the script Snell Roundhand. Gotham was designed in 2000 by [[Jonathan Hoefler]] and [[Tobias Frere-Jones]], originally for [[GQ (magazine)|''GQ'']] magazine. Prior to Gotham, the campaign used the typeface Gill Sans in upper case and lower case.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rawsthorn |first=Alice |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/04/arts/design7.php |work=International Herald Tribune |date=April 6, 2008 |title=Brand Obama, a leader in the image war |accessdate=January 18, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219112053/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/04/arts/design7.php| archivedate=December 19, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> Another Hoefler and Frere-Jones font, [[Requiem (typeface)|Requiem]], was used for the campaign logo.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tschorn |last=Adam |title=Even Obama's typeface gets bloggers buzzing |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 1, 2008 |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1020415.html |url-status=dead |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205034433/http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1020415.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>

Obama was particularly noted for his use of the [[Internet]] to rally supporters and make his policies known. He is the first U.S. President to have effectively used the internet and [[social media]] for successful political outcomes. His successful presidential campaign raised the bar and are now presidential standards.

"The integration of technology into the process of field organizing … is the success of the Obama campaign," says Sanford Dickert, who worked as [[John Kerry]]'s chief technology officer for the [[United States presidential election|2004 campaign]]. "But the use of technology was not the end-all and be-all in this cycle. Technology has been a partner, an enabler for the Obama campaign, bringing the efficiencies of the internet into the real-world problems of organizing people in a distributed, trusted fashion."<ref name="wired.com">Stirland, S.:[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/10/obamas-secret-w/],"Obama's Secret Weapons: Internet, Databases and Psychology", October 29, 2008. Retrieved on May 28, 2009.</ref>

Obama's campaign was further strengthened by his opponent [[John McCain]]'s comparatively limited use of the Internet. McCain did not have the organization of Obama's campaign, nor did he spend a comparable amount of money on this portion of the campaign. Both opportune timing and usage of online campaigning gave Obama significant advantage over McCain.<ref name="wired.com" />

===Social Media===
Through forums and social websites such as [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]], Obama built relationships with his supporters, and would-be supporters. He developed an upfront, personable and face-to-face quality that gave his supporters a sense of security and trust, which inspired them to rally others in their local communities. The supporters of Obama themselves formed a nationwide community.

All of his policies were made available online, and updates were sent to the subscribers of his political party via [[email]] and [[Text messaging|text message]], ultimately making him the most technologically savvy candidate to date, increasing his popularity among young voters.

=== MyBo ===
In early 2007, the Obama campaign launched a social-networking site called my.barackobama.com, or MyBO for short, and recruited 24-year-old [[Facebook]] co-founder [[Chris Hughes]] to help develop the platform and their social networking strategy.<ref name="MIT_personalized" /><ref name="MIT_how_obama">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/410644/how-obama-really-did-it/|title=How Obama Really Did It|last=Talbot|first=David|date=August 19, 2008|magazine=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=December 3, 2016}}</ref> MyBo became the hub of the campaign's online efforts to organize supporters.<ref name="BostonDotCom">{{cite news |last=Talbot |first=David |date=January 8, 2009 |url=http://archive.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2009/01/08/the_geeks_behind_obamas_web_strategy/ |title=The Geeks Behind Obama's Web Strategy |newspaper=The Boston Globe |accessdate=December 3, 2016}}</ref>

The nationwide community provided useful and effective tools, such as the Neighbor-to-Neighbor tool, allowing supporters to reach a large number of people in a short time in their own community, which in turn led to campaign rallying for more Obama support. An unprecedented communication strategy was the "online call tool". Over one million calls were made from residential, personal laptops and desktops.<ref name="Alter, Jonathan 2010"/> Online communication led to Obama supporters engaging in social activities such as signmaking and door-to-door petitioning for Obama support, as well as simply discussing their opinions about policies and issues they supported along with Obama.<ref>Xenos, M. and [[W.

In 2008, campaign staffers stationed in the long-shot battle ground state of Georgia, reinvented the tedious, messy process of reporting and aggregating nightly data and intelligence upward through the campaign apparatus—making the organizing work of vast Obama field infrastructure more immediately measurable.<ref name="PoliticoSoftware">{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2011/06/dem-campaigns-embrace-new-software-057443|title=Dem campaigns embrace new software|last=Smith|first=Ben|date=June 21, 2011|newspaper=Politico|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref><ref name="TechPresident">{{cite news|url=http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/nationalfield-private-social-network-thats-reinventing-ground-game|title=NationalField: The Private Social Network That's Reinventing the Ground Game|last=Scola|first=Nancy|date=May 13, 2011|publisher=TechPresident|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref> [[NationalField]] became an internal social network within the field organization, used to monitor the daily activities of the sprawling grassroots effort.<ref name="RollingStonTech">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/hope-2-0-inside-obamas-campaign-20120329|title=Inside Obama's Campaign|last=Dickinson|first=Tim|date=March 29, 2012|magazine=Rolling Stone|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref> It allowed staff to share what they were working on and benchmark themselves against other staffers.

=== Voter Data ===
After trailing Republicans for many election cycles in their use of micro-targeting, the 2008 Obama campaign was the first Democratic presidential campaign to benefit from the existence of a national voter file. In 2007, DNC chairman [[Howard Dean]] centralized data collection and management by hiring the [[NGP VAN|Voter Activation Network]] and creating the database [[NGP VAN#Votebuilder|Votebuilder]].<ref name="MIT_personalized">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/412208/personalized-campaigning/|title=Personalized Campaigning|last=Talbot|first=David|date=February 24, 2009|magazine=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=December 3, 2016}}</ref> Votebuilder created a web-based interface for the database and permitted the Obama campaign to give neighborhood-level volunteers access to the registered voter list for their area of responsibility.<ref name="CenterForPolitics">{{cite news |last=Sizemore |first=Justin |date=August 14, 2008 |title=The Democratic Ground Game |publisher=Larry J.

===Online advertising===
The Obama web campaign used consumer marketing to target individuals with customized information to their predicted interests. Political communication to viewers was based on data collected about them. This data was collected by volunteers, surveys on the website and records of consumption habits.

In a September 15, 2008 interview with [[Good Morning America]], Obama stated, "If we're going to ask questions about, you know, who has been promulgating negative ads that are completely unrelated to the issues at hand, I think I win that contest pretty handily."
