The '''prime minister of India''' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: ''Bhārat ke Pradhānamantrī'') is the leader of the executive branch of the [[Government of India]]. The prime minister is the chief adviser to the [[president of India]] and the head of the [[Union Council of Ministers]]. They can be a member of any of the two houses of the [[Parliament of India]]—the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of the People) and the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of the States); but has to be a member of the political party or coalition, having a majority in the Lok Sabha.

The prime minister is the senior-most member of cabinet in the executive of government in a [[Westminster system|parliamentary system]]. The prime minister selects and can dismiss members of the cabinet; allocates posts to members within the government; and is the presiding member and chairperson of the cabinet.

The [[Union Council of Ministers|Union Cabinet]] headed by the prime minister is appointed by the President of India to assist the latter in the administration of the affairs of the executive. Union cabinet is collectively responsible to the [[Lok Sabha]] as per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 75(3)]] of the [[Constitution of India]]. The prime minister has to enjoy the confidence of a majority in the Lok Sabha and shall resign if they are unable to prove majority when instructed by the president.

==Origins and history==
India follows a [[parliamentary system]] in which the prime minister is the presiding [[head of the government]] and chief of the executive of the government. In such systems, the [[head of state]], or, the head of state's official representative (i.e., the monarch, president, or [[governor-general]]) usually holds a purely ceremonial position and acts—on most matters—only on the advice of the prime minister.

The prime minister—if they are not already—shall become a [[Member of Parliament (India)|member of parliament]] within six months of beginning his/her tenure. A prime minister is expected to work with other central ministers to ensure the passage of bills by the parliament.

{{Timeline prime minister of India}}

==== 1947–1984 ====
Since 1947, there have been 14 different prime ministers.{{Efn|Not including [[Gulzarilal Nanda]] who served, twice, as acting prime minister.}} The first few decades after 1947 saw the [[Indian National Congress]]' (INC) almost complete domination over the political map of India. India's first prime minister—[[Jawaharlal Nehru]]—took oath on 15 August 1947. Nehru went on to serve as prime minister for 17 consecutive years, winning four [[Elections in India|general election]]s in the process. His tenure ended in May 1964, on his death.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA32|title=A Man Who, with All His Mind and Heart, Loved India|date=5 June 1964|work=Life|pages=32}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0527.html|title=India Mourning Nehru, 74, Dead of a Heart Attack; World Leaders Honor Him|date=27 May 1964|website=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|oclc=1645522|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> After the death of Nehru, [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]]—a former [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|home minister]] and a leader of the Congress party—ascended to the position of Prime Minister. Shastri's tenure saw the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]]. Shashtri subsequently died of a reported heart attack in [[Tashkent]], after signing the [[Tashkent Declaration]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/soutikbiswas/2009/08/was_mr_shastri_murdered.html|title=Was Mr Shastri murdered?|last=Biswas|first=Soutik|date=27 August 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>

After Shastri, [[Indira Gandhi]]—Nehru's daughter—was elected as the country's first woman prime minister. Indira's first term in office lasted 11 years, in which she took steps such as [[Banking in India#Nationalisation in the 1960s|nationalisation of banks]];<ref>{{Cite book|title=Working a democratic constitution: A history of the Indian experience|last=Granville|first=Austin|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0195656107|location=Delhi|pages=215|oclc=52992056}}</ref> end of [[Privy Purse in India|allowances]] and political posts, which were received by members of the royal families of the erstwhile [[princely state]]s of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=India's silent revolution: The rise of the lower castes in North India|last=Christophe|first=Jaffrelot|publisher=[[C.

After widespread protests, the emergency was lifted in 1977, and a [[Elections in India|general election]] was to be held. All of the political parties of the opposition—after the conclusion of the emergency—fought together against the Congress, under the umbrella of the [[Janata Party]], in the [[1977 Indian general election|general election of 1977]], and were successful in defeating the Congress. Subsequently, [[Morarji Desai]]—a former [[Deputy Prime Minister of India|deputy prime minister]]—became the first non-Congress prime minister of the country. The government of Prime Minister Desai was composed of groups with opposite ideologies, in which unity and co-ordination were difficult to maintain. Ultimately, after two and a half years as PM; on 28 July 1979, Morarji tendered his resignation to the president; and his government fell. Thereafter, [[Charan Singh]]—a deputy prime minister in Desai's cabinet—with outside, conditional support from Congress, proved a majority in [[Lok Sabha]] and took oath as prime minister.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Predictioneer's game: Using the logic of brazen self-interest to see and shape the future|last=Bueno de Mesquita|first=Bruce|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8129-7977-0|edition=1st|location=New York City|pages=xxiii|oclc=290470064}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Congress, Indira to Sonia Gandhi|last=Sanghvi|first=Vijay|publisher=Kalpaz Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-8178353401|location=Delhi|pages=114–122|oclc=74972515}}</ref> However, Congress pulled its support shortly after, and Singh had to resign; he had a tenure of 5 months, the shortest in the history of the office.

== Constitutional framework and position of prime minister ==
The [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] envisions a scheme of affairs in which the [[president of India]] is the head of state; in terms of Article 53 with office of the prime minister being the head of [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of India|Council of Ministers]] to assist and advise the president in the discharge of his/her constitutional functions. To quote, Article 53, [[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part V|74]] and 75 provide as under;
{{quote|The executive powers of the Union shall be vested in the president and shall be exercised either directly or through subordinate officers, in accordance with the Constitution.| Article 53(1), Constitution of India}}
{{quote|There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the president who shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice.| [[Article 74 (Constitution of India)|Article 74(1)]], Constitution of India}} 
{{quote|The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.| Article 75(1), Constitution of India}}
Like most [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]], the [[Head of state|president]]'s duties are mostly [[Titular ruler|ceremonial]] as long as the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] and the [[rule of law]] is obeyed by the cabinet and the legislature. The prime minister of India is the head of government and has the responsibility for executive power. The president's constitutional duty is to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|article 60]]. In the constitution of India, the prime minister is mentioned in only four of its articles (articles 74, 75, 78 and 366), however he/she plays a crucial role in the [[government of India]] by enjoying majority in the [[Lok Sabha]].

==Appointment, tenure and removal==
===Eligibility===
According to Article 84 of the Constitution of India, which sets the principle qualification for member of Parliament, and Article 75 of the Constitution of India, which sets the qualifications for the minister in the Union Council of Ministers, and the argument that the position of prime minister has been described as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (the first among equals),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to the Constitution of India|last1=Basu|first1=Durga Das|last2=Manohar|first2=V.

* be a [[Indian nationality law|citizen of India]].
* be a member of the [[Lok Sabha]] or the [[Rajya Sabha]]. If the person chosen as the prime minister is neither a member of the Lok Sabha nor the Rajya Sabha at the time of selection, they must become a member of either of the houses within six months.
* be above 25 years of age if they are a [[Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha|member of the Lok Sabha]], or, above 30 years of age if they are a [[Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha|member of the Rajya Sabha]].
* not hold any office of profit under the government of India or the government of any state or under any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said governments.

If however a candidate is elected as the prime minister they must vacate their post from any private or government company and may take up the post only on completion of their term.

===Oaths of office and secrecy===
[[File:Shri_Narendra_Modi_sworn_in_as_Prime_Minister.jpg|thumb|[[First swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi]], 2014.]]
The prime minister is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the [[President of India]] before entering office, the oath of office and secrecy, as per the Third Schedule of the Constitution of India.

Oath of office:
{{Quotation|I, <name>, do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will faithfully and conscientiously discharge my duties as Prime Minister for the Union and that I will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.|[[Constitution of India]], Third Schedule, Part I|title=|source=}}

Oath of secrecy:
{{Quotation|I, <name>, do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that I will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person or persons any matter which shall be brought under my consideration or shall become known to me as Prime Minister for the Union except as may be required for the due discharge of my duties as such Minister.|Constitution of India, Third Schedule, Part II}}

===Tenure and removal from office===
The prime minister serves on 'the pleasure of the president', hence, a prime minister may remain in office indefinitely, so long as the president has confidence in him/her. However, a prime minister must have the confidence of Lok Sabha, the lower house of the [[Parliament of India]].

However, the term of a prime minister can end before the end of a Lok Sabha's term, if a [[Majority|simple majority]] of its members no longer have confidence in him/her, this is called a [[Motion of no confidence|vote-of-no-confidence]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19870515-under-the-constitution-does-the-president-have-the-right-to-remove-the-prime-minister-798837-1987-05-15|title=Under the Constitution, does the President have the right to remove the Prime Minister?|last1=Gupta|first1=Surajeet Das|last2=Badhwar|first2=Inderjit|date=15 May 1987|website=[[India Today]]|publisher=[[Aroon Purie]]|issn=0254-8399|access-date=10 April 2018}}</ref> Three prime ministers, [[I.

=== National Defence Fund ===
{{Main|National Defence Fund}}
The [[National Defence Fund]] (NDF) was set up the Indian government in 1962, in the aftermath of [[Sino-Indian War|1962 Sino-Indian War]]. The prime minister acts as chairperson of the fund's executive committee, while, the ministers of defence, finance and home act as the members of the executive committee, the finance minister also acts the treasurer of the committee. The secretary of the fund's executive committee is a [[Joint secretary to Government of India|joint secretary]] in the prime minister's office, dealing with the subject of NDF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/national-defence-fund/|title=National Defence Fund|website=Prime Minister of India, [[Government of India]]|access-date=10 April 2018}}</ref> The fund—according to its website—is "entirely dependent on voluntary contributions from the public and does not get any budgetary support.".

The fund, now, is primarily used to assist the families of those who are killed during natural disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones and flood and secondarily to reimburse medical expenses of people with chronic and deadly diseases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/pms-funds/|title=PM National Relief Fund|website=Prime Minister of India, [[Government of India]]|access-date=10 April 2018}}</ref> Donations to the PMNRF are 100% tax-deductible under section 80G of the ''Income Tax Act, 1961''.<ref name=":10" />

== Deputy Prime Minister ==
{{Main|Deputy Prime Minister of India}}
[[File:Sardar patel (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Vallabhbhai Patel]] was the first [[Deputy Prime Minister of India]].]]
The post of [[Deputy Prime Minister of India]] is not technically a constitutional post, nor is there any mention of it in an Act of the parliament.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/of-deputy-chief-ministers-and-the-constitution/article3632410.ece|title=Of Deputy Chief Ministers and the Constitution|last=Rajendran|first=S.|date=13 July 2012|work=[[The Hindu]]|access-date=5 April 2018|publisher=[[The Hindu Group]]|location=[[Bangalore]]|issn=0971-751X|oclc=13119119}}</ref> But historically, on various occasions, different governments have assigned one of their senior ministers as the deputy prime minister. There is neither constitutional requirement for filling the post of deputy PM, nor does the post provide any kind of special powers.<ref name=":2" /> Typically, senior cabinet ministers like the [[Minister of Finance (India)|finance minister]] or the [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|home minister]] are appointed as Deputy Prime Minister. The post is considered to be the senior most in the cabinet after the prime minister and represents the government in his/her absence. Generally, deputy prime ministers have been appointed to strengthen the coalition governments. The first holder of this post was [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], who was also the home minister in Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet.
