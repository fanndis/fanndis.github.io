The "'''Hillary Doctrine'''" is the [[doctrine]] of former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], particularly in reference to her stance that [[women's rights]] and [[violence against women]] should be considered issues of [[national security]]. The doctrine encompasses stances she has held before, during, and after her tenure as secretary.

==The doctrine==
The doctrine is most explicitly stated in a December 8, 2010, surprise appearance talk<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/12/12/clinton.empower.girls/ | title=Hillary Clinton: Empower girls and women | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=December 12, 2010}}</ref> that Clinton made at the [[TED (conference)|TEDWoman Conference]] in Washington, D.C.:

<blockquote>So the United States has made empowering women and girls a cornerstone of our foreign policy, because women's equality is not just a moral issue, it's not just a humanitarian issue, it is not just a fairness issue; it is a security issue. It is a prosperity issue and it is a peace issue ... Give women equal rights, and entire nations are more stable and secure. Deny women equal rights, and the instability of nations is almost certain. The subjugation of women is, therefore, a threat to the common security of our world and to the national security of our country.<ref>Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', p. 3.</ref></blockquote>

The principle was incorporated into the inaugural [[Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review]] that was conducted and published by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] during 2009–10, which mentioned women and girls over 130&nbsp;times and which said "The protection and empowerment of women and girls is key to the foreign policy and security of the United States."<ref>Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', pp. 4, 53.</ref>

The doctrine was stated again by Clinton in the culminating chapter of ''[[Hard Choices]]'', her 2014 memoir of her time as secretary:

<blockquote>...  It was no coincidence that the places where women's lives were most undervalued largely lined up with the parts of the world most plagued by instability, conflict, extremism, and poverty. This was a point lost on many of the men working across Washington's foreign policy establishment, but over the years I came to view it as one of the most compelling arguments for why standing up for women and girls was not just the right thing to do but also smart and strategic ... the correlation was undeniable, and a growing body of research showed that improving conditions for women helped resolve conflicts and stabilize societies. "Women's issues" had long been relegated to the margins of U.S. foreign policy and international diplomacy, considered at best a nice thing to work on but hardly a necessity. I became convinced that, in fact, this was a cause that cut to the heart of our national security.<ref>Clinton, ''Hard Choices'', p. 562.</ref></blockquote>

==History and analysis==
The roots of the doctrine begin with the lineage of Clinton's political career from standing in the shadow of her husband, President [[Bill Clinton]], as [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], to being put in the public spotlight in her own right during a speech she gave at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in 1995 in Beijing. [[Women's Rights Are Human Rights|In this speech]], Clinton made the proclamation that, "if there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all."<ref name=a /> This statement was a pivotal moment and starting point in the formation of what subsequently became known as the Hillary Doctrine.<ref>Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', pp. 7–9.</ref>

Another important early marker was the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]] and the National Action Plans that came out of it.<ref name="cfr-zenko">{{cite news | url=http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2015/06/24/book-review-the-hillary-doctrine-sex-american-foreign-policy/ | title=Book Review – 'The Hillary Doctrine: Sex & American Foreign Policy' | first=Micah | last=Zenko|authorlink=Micah Zenko | publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] | date=June 24, 2015}} Also published in ''[[Newsweek]]'' as [http://www.newsweek.com/did-hillary-implement-womens-issues-foreign-policy-347219 "Did Hillary Implement a Women's-Issues Foreign Policy?"], June 26, 2015.</ref> And during her [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] confirmation hearings to become Secretary of State, Clinton stated: "I want to pledge to you that as secretary of state I view [women's] issues as central to our foreign policy, not as adjunct or auxiliary or in any way lesser than all of the other issues that we have to confront."<ref name="cfr-zenko"/>

The explicit notion of such a thing was first introduced<ref name="tnr-rev">{{cite news | url=https://newrepublic.com/article/122132/does-hillary-really-believe-hillary-doctrine | title=Does Hillary Really Believe in the Hillary Doctrine? | first=Jordan Michael | last= Smith | magazine=[[The New Republic]] | date=June 23, 2015}}</ref> by a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article entitled "The Hillary Doctrine" and published in March 2011 by journalist [[Gayle Tzemach Lemmon]].<ref name=a>{{cite web|last=Lemmon|first=Gayle Tzemach|title=The Hillary Doctrine|url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2011/03/06/the-hillary-doctrine.html|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|date=March 6, 2011|authorlink=Gayle Tzemach Lemmon}}</ref> In it, Clinton is quoted as saying that she believes "that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century."<ref name=a /> To strengthen her argument for women's rights, Clinton situates this issue within the context of national security, in that, "where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges."<ref name=a />

In another article by Lemmon, published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in April 2013,<ref name=c>{{cite web|last=Lemmon|first=Gayle Tzemach|title=The Hillary Doctrine: Women's Rights Are a National Security Issue|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/the-hillary-doctrine-womens-rights-are-a-national-security-issue/274770/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=April 8, 2013|authorlink=Gayle Tzemach Lemmon}}</ref> the Hillary Doctrine is again elucidated. Lemmon cites a speech given by Clinton to the [[Women in the World|Women in the World Summit]] soon after leaving the State Department<ref>{{cite web|title=Hillary Clinton: Helping Women Isn't Just a 'Nice' Thing to Do|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/04/05/hillary-clinton-helping-women-isn-t-just-a-nice-thing-to-do.html|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}</ref> in which she reflects upon the case she made for women's rights in the past and argues that "too many otherwise thoughtful people continue to see the fortunes of women and girls as somehow separate from society at large."<ref name=c /> Further, Clinton explains how [[Extremism|extremists]] rely upon this ignorance to keep women from being liberated, and, with that, also bar entire societies from liberation. However, rather than speaking in purely abstract terms of "extremists" and "societies", Clinton concretely identifies some countries that she wants to see treat their women better, namely: [[Women in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Women in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Women in India|India]], and at a different level, the [[Women in the United States|United States]] itself.<ref name=c /> To conclude, Lemmon speculates whether the Hillary Doctrine will be transformed into a political platform upon which Clinton can [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|run for President in 2015]]. However, regardless of speculation on Clinton's actions in the future, for now, the Hillary Doctrine stands as an important contribution to [[national security]] discussions around the world.

In their 2015 book ''The Hillary Doctrine: Sex and American Foreign Policy'', [[Texas A&M University]] professor [[Valerie M. Hudson]] and former [[World Health Organization]] manager and consultant Patricia Leidl examine the Hillary Doctrine at length, beginning with its premise.<ref name="cfr-zenko"/> At first, the notion was considered counter-intuitive and sometimes received cursory dismissal within academic circles.<ref name="is-hudson-etal"/> But Hudson surveys research that she and others have done, in part using the [[WomanStats Project]] database, on the link between violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the level of national security and stability of that state.<ref name="hl-ch2">Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', pp. 69–73.</ref> They summarize one set of findings by saying: "What the research team found was that the best predictor of a state's peacefulness was not level of democracy, or wealth, or civilizational identity: The best predictor of a state's peacefulness was its level of violence against women. These findings cut across wealth, regime type, and region."<ref name="hl-ch2"/> Several case studies are described that investigate causation, such as looking [[sex-selective abortion]] and [[female infanticide]] in Asia, [[rape during the Congo civil wars]], the fate of [[women in the Arab Spring]], and at greatest length, ongoing [[violence against women in Guatemala]].<ref>Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', pp. 73–144.</ref>

Hudson and Leidl then look at the [[foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration]] and [[Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State]] to see whether their actions reflected commitment to the Hillary Doctrine. In many cases, they found that it did, such as appointing many women to positions of power, increasing funding for the [[Office of Global Women's Issues]] by a factor of ten, heavy use of social media, and Clinton's local visits to women's groups.<ref name="hl-52">Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', pp. 51–52.</ref> Indeed, Clinton made the empowerment of women worldwide the signature issue of her time as Secretary of State.<ref name="hl-52"/> But they also note a number of occasions where Clinton and the administration were silent about abuses of women or girls due to strategic needs of the U.S., most of all in the "conspicuous silence" about [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia's treatment of its female population]].<ref name="tnr-rev"/> Finally, they look at implementation, and find that during the period in question much was done to implement the Hillary Doctrine in Washington by means of setting up a regulatory and legal framework for it, but that there was a more mixed record past that point, with omissions and weaknesses occurring in the program development, contracting, and local implementation phases.<ref>Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', p. 183.</ref>

Critiques of the doctrine have suggested that it embodies "imperial feminism", the promotion of [[Feminism|feminist]] values in order to justify militarism and a modern-day U.S. empire.<ref name="hl-60">Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', pp. 33, 60–62.</ref> Another line of concern is that U.S. actions put women at risk over time, with particular attention to those who were encouraged to take a more prominent role in pushing for [[women's rights in Afghanistan]] and anxiety for their safety following the planned [[withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan|withdrawal of U.S. forces from that country]].<ref name="hl-60"/> Indeed, Hudson and Leidl consider the condition of Afghan women to be a litmus test for whether the Hillary Doctrine can achieve realization.<ref>Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', p. 234.</ref> Other theories to explain the root causes of conflict and international instability also exist, such as the [[Clash of Civilizations]] hypothesis, [[democratic peace theory]], and an emphasis on [[Thomas Homer-Dixon|environmental poverty and scarcity]].<ref name="is-hudson-etal">{{cite journal | last=Hudson | first=Valerie M. | first2=Mary | last2=Caprioli | first3= Bonnie | last3=Ballif-Spanvill | first4=Rose | last4=McDermott | first5= Chad F. | last5=Emmett | date=Winter 2008–09 | title=The Heart of the Matter: The Security of Women and the Security of States | journal=[[International Security]] | volume= 33 | number= 3 | pages= 7–45 | doi=10.1162/isec.2009.33.3.7}}</ref>

==Other formulations==
Several other definitions of what a "Hillary Doctrine" might be have appeared in print.<ref name="tnr-rev"/>
Another article titled "The Hillary Doctrine", published in ''The Atlantic'' in January 2013 by journalist [[David Rohde]],<ref name=b>{{cite news|last=Rohde|first=David|title=The Hillary Doctrine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/01/the-hillary-doctrine/272511/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=January 25, 2013|authorlink=David Rohde}}</ref> talks about the terms of exchanges between Clinton and other American politicians within discussions of dilemmas concerning the United States and certain African countries. This time, Clinton explicitly called out actions taken by the United States abroad, and argued that, contrary to popular belief, "a lot of the challenges we face are not immediately – or sustainably – solved by military action alone."<ref name=b /> Further, while the aforementioned doctrine focuses on populations, such as women and children, that are typically ignored within discussions of national security, Clinton also makes an effort to push for including places that have historically been ignored within national security discussions, as well.<ref name=b /> However, Rohde never mentions the phrase "Hillary Doctrine" in the piece, and it could have been the creation of the magazine's headline writer.<ref name="tnr-rev"/>

In April 2015, [[James M. Goldgeier]], political scientist and dean of the [[School of International Service]] at [[American University]], wrote an article titled "The Hillary Clinton Doctrine" (the only place in the article that mentions "doctrine") for ''[[The National Interest]]''.<ref name="ni-jmg">{{cite news | url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-hillary-clinton-doctrine-12681?page=show | title=The Hillary Clinton Doctrine | first=James M. | last=Goldgeier | authorlink=James M. Goldgeier | magazine=[[The National Interest]] | date=April 21, 2015}}</ref> However, the article mostly analyzes foreign policy trends of the last several U.S. administrations and makes suggestions for what a Hillary Clinton foreign policy should be<ref name="ni-jmg"/> while emphasizing the limitations and difficulties of possible courses of action.<ref name="tnr-rev"/>

No explicit mention of a "Hillary Doctrine" by name has been made by Clinton herself. Moreover, in ''Hard Choices'', she stated that there was no unified "[[Obama Doctrine]]" during her tenure either, saying the range of problems the country faced did not allow for a "simple and elegant road map" to deal with them.<ref>Clinton, ''Hard Choices'', p. 30.</ref> However, in an August 2014 interview with journalist [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] of ''The Atlantic'', Clinton seems to yearn for such an approach in dealing with [[jihadism]] that was comparable to the [[containment strategy]] the U.S. used against the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].<ref name="atl-jg-hrc"/>  She made reference to a much-quoted simple dictum of Obama's by saying, "Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle."<ref name="atl-jg-hrc">{{cite news | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/hillary-clinton-failure-to-help-syrian-rebels-led-to-the-rise-of-isis/375832/?single_page=true | title=Hillary Clinton: 'Failure' to Help Syrian Rebels Led to the Rise of ISIS | first=Jeffrey | last=Goldberg | authorlink=Jeffrey Goldberg | magazine=[[The Atlantic]] | date=August 10, 2014}}</ref> Analyzing this interview, in August 2014, journalist [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] wrote an article called "The Hillary Doctrine: 'Smart Power' or 'Back to the Crusades'?" in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that stated that Clinton was advocating "a sustained global campaign targeting radical Islam (some, doubtless, will call it a 'crusade') that encompasses all of the options at the disposal of the United States and its allies: military, diplomatic, economic, political, and rhetorical."<ref name="nykr-jc">{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-doctrine-one | title=The Hillary Doctrine: 'Smart Power' or 'Back to the Crusades'? | first=John | last=Cassidy | authorlink=John Cassidy (journalist) | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=August 11, 2014}}</ref> But again, the phrase "Hillary Doctrine" is only in the piece's headline.<ref name="nykr-jc"/>
