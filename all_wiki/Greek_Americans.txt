==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Greek american Migrant - late 19th--20th century.jpg|thumb|180px|A young [[Greeks|Greek]] [[immigrant]] on [[Ellis Island]], [[New York City]], late 19th century]]

The first Greek known to have been to what is now the United States was Don Doroteo Teodoro, a sailor who landed in Boca Ciega Bay at the Jungle Prada site in present-day St. Petersburg, FL with the [[Narváez expedition]] in 1528. <ref> {{cite book| last= MacDougald |first= James | title= The Pánfilo de Narváez Expedition of 1528 | date= 2018 | publisher= Marsden House | location= St. Petersburg, FL | isbn= 978-1-4834-8671-0}} </ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.txstate.edu/swwc/cdv/book/25.html|title=Cabeza de Vaca's La Relacion|access-date=March 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.txstate.edu/swwc/cdv/book/29.html|title=Cabeza de Vaca's La Relacion|access-date=March 17, 2015}}</ref> He was instrumental in building the rafts that the expedition survivors built and sailed from present-day St. Mark's River in Florida until they were shipwrecked near Galveston Island, Texas. Teodoro had been captured by natives as they sailed along the Gulf coast shoreline toward the west, and was never seen again. <ref> {{cite book|last= Adorno |first= Rolena |author2=Pautz, Patrick |title= Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca: His Account, His Life, and the Expedition of Panfilo de Narváez |date= 1999-09-15 |publisher= [[University of Nebraska Press]] |location= Lincoln |isbn= 978-0-8032-1463-7 }}, 3 vols.</ref>

In 1592, Greek captain [[Juan de Fuca]] (Ioannis Fokas or Apostolos Valerianos) sailed up the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast under the Spanish flag, in search of the fabled [[Northwest Passage]] between the Pacific and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. He reported discovering a body of water, a [[strait]] which today bears his name: the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], which today forms part of the [[Canada–United States border]].

About 500 Greeks from [[Smyrna]], [[Crete]], and [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] settled in [[New Smyrna Beach, Florida]] in 1768. The colony was unsuccessful, and the settlers moved to [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in 1776. The [[St. Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine|St Photios Greek Chapel]] exists as a remnant of their presence, having been built atop the site of the Avero House, itself believed to be the first site of Greek Orthodox worship in the US.<ref>{{cite web|last=Leonard|first=M.

===19th century===
[[File:Greek-American volunteers in the Balkan Wars.jpg|thumb|180px|Greek-American volunteers in the Balkan Wars]]

The first significant Greek community to develop was in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] during the 1850s. By 1866, the community was numerous and prosperous enough to have a Greek [[Consul (representative)|consulate]] and the first official [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greekfestnola.com/churchhistory.html|title=History of the Holy Trinity Cathedral|publisher=greekfestnola.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520215428/http://www.greekfestnola.com/churchhistory.html|archive-date=May 20, 2007}}</ref> During that period, most Greek immigrants to the [[New World]] came from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and those [[Aegean Islands]] still under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. By 1890, there were almost 15,000 Greeks living in the U.S.

Immigration picked up again in the 1890s and early 20th century, due largely to economic opportunity in the U.S., displacement caused by the hardships of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, the [[Balkan Wars]], and [[World War I]]. Most of these immigrants had come from southern Greece, especially from the Peloponnesian provinces of Laconia and Arcadia.<ref name="Barkan1999">{{cite book|last=Barkan|first=Elliott Robert|title=A Nation of Peoples: A Sourcebook on America's Multicultural Heritage|url=https://archive.org/details/nationofpeopless00bark|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29961-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nationofpeopless00bark/page/252 252]–253}}</ref> 450,000 Greeks arrived to the States between 1890 and 1917, most working in the cities of the [[northeastern United States]]; others labored on railroad construction and in mines of the [[western United States]]; another 70,000 arrived between 1918 and 1924. Each wave of immigration contributed to the growth of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]] in the U.S.

Greek immigration at this time was over 90% male, contrasted with most other European immigration to the U.S., such as [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigration, which averaged 50% to 60% male. Many Greek immigrants expected to work and return to their [[homeland]] after earning capital and dowries for their families. However, the loss of their homeland due to the [[Greek Genocide]] and the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], which displaced 1,500,000 Greeks from [[Anatolia]], [[Eastern Thrace]], and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] caused the initial economic immigrants to reside permanently in America. The Greeks were [[de jure]] denaturalized from their homelands and lost the right to return, and their families were made refugees. Additionally, the first widely implemented [[Immigration Act of 1924|U.S. immigration limits against non Western European immigrants]] were made in 1924, creating an impetus for immigrants to apply for citizenship, bring their families and permanently settle in the U.S. Fewer than 30,000 Greek immigrants arrived in the U.S. between 1925 and 1945, most of whom were "[[Mail-order bride|picture brides]]" for single Greek men and family members coming over to join relatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpa.gr/specials/us_hellenes/micra_asia.html|script-title=el:Κατατρεγμένοι Έλληνες από τη Μ.

===20th century===
[[File:Sponge auction in Tarpon Springs (9190026157).jpg|thumb|220px|Sponge auction in [[Tarpon Springs, Florida]], in 1947. The community has the highest percentage of Greek Americans of any city in the US]]

The events of the early 1920s also provided the stimulus for the first permanent national Greek American religious and civic organizations. Greeks again began to arrive in large numbers after 1945, fleeing the economic devastation caused by [[World War II]] and the [[Greek Civil War]]. From 1945 until 1982, approximately 211,000 Greeks emigrated to the United States. These later immigrants were less influenced by the powerful assimilation pressures of the 1920s and 1930s and revitalized Greek American identity, especially in areas such as Greek-language media.

Greek immigrants founded more than 600 [[diner]]s in the New York metropolitan area in the 1950s through the 1970s. Immigration to the United States from Greece peaked between the 1950s and 1970.<ref>{{cite news|first=Joseph|last=Berger|title=Diners in Changing Hands; Greek Ownership on the Wane|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/16Rdinersnj.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=March 16, 2008|access-date=March 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Dena|last=Kleiman|title=Greek Diners, Where Anything Is Possible|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/27/garden/greek-diners-where-anything-is-possible.html?pagewanted=all|quote=... Greeks became a visible presence in the diner and coffee shop business in the late 1950s after several waves of immigration. They congregated largely on the East Coast, where the food service industry provided an easy economic foothold for many immigrants who were often unskilled and unable to speak English. As with immigrants from many nations, one relative would send word of opportunity back home, encouraging others to come to America|work=[[New York Times]]|date=February 27, 1991|access-date=May 27, 2009}}</ref> After the 1981 admission of Greece to the [[European Union]], annual U.S. immigration numbers fell to less than 2,000. In recent years, Greek immigration to the United States has been minimal; in fact, net migration has been towards Greece. Over 72,000 U.S. citizens currently live in Greece (1999); most of them are Greek Americans.

The predominant religion among Greeks and Greek Americans is [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christianity]]. There are also a number of Americans who descend from [[Greece]]'s smaller [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] [[Jew]]ish communities.

===21st century===
In the aftermath of the [[Greek financial crisis]], there has been a resurgence of [[Greek diaspora|Greek emigration]] to New York City since 2010, accelerating in 2015, and centered upon the traditional Greek enclave of [[Astoria, Queens]].<ref name=GreekResurgenceNewYork>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/world/greeks-in-new-york-talk-and-cheer-then-debate-future-after-referendum.html|title=Greeks in New York Talk and Cheer, Then Debate Future After Referendum|author=Annie Correal and Colleen Wright|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 5, 2015|access-date=July 5, 2015}}</ref> According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', this new wave of Greek migration to New York is not being driven as much by opportunities in New York as it is by a lack of economic options in Greece itself.<ref name=GreekResurgenceNewYork/>

There are hundreds of regional, religious and professional Greek American organizations. Some of the largest and most notable include:
* The [[American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association]] (AHEPA) is the largest community organization of Greek Americans. It was founded in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in 1922 to counter the anti-Greek attacks by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] during that time period. Its current membership exceeds 18,000.
* The [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]] is the religious organization most closely associated with the Greek American community. It was established in 1921, and is under the leadership of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The church operates the [[Greek Orthodox Youth of America]], the largest Orthodox Christian youth group in the United States.
* The American Hellenic Institute, an [[advocacy group]] for Greek Americans, and its lobbying arm, the [[American Hellenic Institute Public Affairs Committee]].
* [[The Next Generation Initiative]], a foundation that works with prominent Greek American leaders and executives to offer educational opportunities such as [[internships]] and master classes through a network of more than 5,500 Greek American students and 2,500 professors on 200+ college campuses.
* The [[Council of Hellenes Abroad]] is a Greek government sponsored umbrella organization for Greek immigrant organizations worldwide.
* The [http://www.paideiausa.org Hellenic Society Paideia] has been promoting Hellenism and Orthodoxy since 1977 by placing Greek and Byzantium classes in high schools and universities, offering study abroad programs to Greece year round, and with various building projects throughout the country. Anywhere from 200 to 500 students travel to Greece with Paideia per year. Information specifically for the study abroad programs can be found at [http://www.hellenicstudiespaideia.org www.hellenicstudiespaideia.org] Currently "Paideia" is constructing a Classical Greek Amphitheater at the University of Connecticut and a Center for Hellenic Studies at the University of Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paideiausa.org|title=paideiausa|access-date=March 17, 2015}}</ref>
