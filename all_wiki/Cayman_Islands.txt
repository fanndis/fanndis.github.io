The '''Cayman Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|m|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|k|eɪ|'|m|æ|n}}) is an autonomous [[British overseas territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the western [[Caribbean Sea]]. The {{convert|264|km2|abbr=off|adj=mid}} territory comprises the three islands of [[Grand Cayman]], [[Cayman Brac]] and [[Little Cayman]], which are located to the south of [[Cuba]] and northeast of [[Honduras]], between [[Jamaica]] and [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. The capital city is [[George Town, Cayman Islands|George Town]] on Grand Cayman, which is the most populous of the three islands.

The Cayman Islands is considered to be part of the geographic [[Western Caribbean Zone]] as well as the [[Greater Antilles]]. The territory is often considered a major world [[offshore financial centre|offshore financial haven]] for international businesses and many wealthy individuals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tax/schemes/cayman.html|title=Tax me if you can.

All three islands were formed by large [[coral heads]] covering submerged ice age peaks of western extensions of the Cuban [[Sierra Maestra]] range and are mostly flat. One notable exception to this is [[The Bluff (Cayman Islands)|The Bluff]] on Cayman Brac's eastern part, which rises to {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the highest point on the islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/highlow.htm |title=World Atlas Highest and Lowest points |work=web page |publisher=Graphic Maps |access-date=23 October 2011 }}</ref>

Terrain is mostly a low-lying [[limestone]] base surrounded by [[coral reef]]s.

===Fauna===
{{See also|List of mammals of the Cayman Islands|List of birds of the Cayman Islands|List of butterflies of the Cayman Islands}}
The [[mammal]]ian species in the Cayman Islands include the introduced [[Dasyprocta punctata|Central American agouti]]<ref name = MSW3>{{MSW3 Hystricognathi | id = 13400244 | page = 1558}}</ref> and [[Bats of the Caribbean#Grand Cayman|eight species of bats]]. At least three now extinct [[List of rodents of the Caribbean#Cayman Islands|native rodent species]] were present until the discovery of the islands by Europeans. Marine life around the island of the Grand Cayman includes [[tarpon]], silversides (''[[Atheriniformes]]''), [[French angelfish]] (''Pomacanthus paru''), and [[giant barrel sponge]]s. A number of [[List of cetacean species|cetaceans]] are found in offshore waters. These species include the [[Ziphius cavirostris|goose-beaked whale]] (''Ziphius cavirostris''), [[Blainville's beaked whale]] (''Mesoplodon densirostris'') and [[sperm whale]] (''Physeter macrocephalus'').

Cayman [[birds|avian fauna]] includes two [[endemic]] subspecies of ''[[Amazona]]'' parrots: ''Amazona leucocephala hesterna'' or [[Cuban amazon]], presently restricted to the island of [[Cayman Brac]], but formerly also on [[Little Cayman]], and ''Amazona leucocephala caymanensis'' or [[Grand Cayman parrot]], which is native to the Cayman Islands, forested areas of [[Cuba]], and the [[Isla de la Juventud]].

===Languages===
The official language of the Cayman Islands is [[English language|English]] (90%).<ref name=":0" /> Islanders' accents retain elements passed down from English, Scottish, and Welsh settlers (among others) in a language variety known as Cayman Creole. Caymanians of Jamaican origin speak in their own vernacular (see Jamaican Creole and Jamaican English). It is also quite commonplace to hear some residents converse in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]<ref name=":0" /> as many citizens have relocated from Latin America to work and live on Grand Cayman. The Latin American nations with greatest representation are Honduras, Cuba, Colombia, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. Spanish speakers comprise approximately between 10-12% of the population and is predominantly of the Caribbean dialect. [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] is spoken by about 5% of inhabitants most of whom are Filipino residents on work permits.<ref name=":0" />

The economy of the Cayman Islands is dominated by financial services and tourism, together accounting for 50-60% of [[Gross Domestic Product]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cj.html|title=The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> The nation's low tax rates have led to it being used as a [[tax haven]] for corporations; there are 100,000 companies registered in the Cayman Islands, more than the population itself.

With an average income of around KYD$47,000 (about US$56,000), Caymanians have the highest standard of living in the Caribbean.

One of [[Grand Cayman]]'s main attractions is [[Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman|Seven Mile Beach]], site of a number of the island's hotels and resorts. Named one of the Ultimate Beaches by Caribbean Travel and Life, Seven Mile Beach is a public beach on the western shore of Grand Cayman Island.<ref>[http://www.caymanislands.ky/activities/beaches/sevenmilebeach.aspx Seven Mile Beach | Grand Cayman, Caribbean Vacation | Cayman Islands].

All three islands offer [[scuba diving]], and the Cayman Islands is home to several snorkelling locations where tourists can swim with [[stingray]]s. The most popular area to do this is [[Stingray City, Grand Cayman]]. Stingray City is a top attraction in Grand Cayman and originally started in the 1980s, when divers started feeding squid to stingrays. The stingrays started to associate the sound of the boat motors with food, and thus visit this area year round.<ref>[http://www.caymanislands.ky/activities/attractions/stingraycity.aspx Stingray City | Grand Cayman, Grand Cayman Vacation | Cayman Islands].

There are two [[shipwreck]]s off the shores of Cayman Brac, including the [[Sinking ships for wreck diving sites#List of ships sunk for wreck diving|MV Captain Keith Tibbetts]];<ref>Tim Rock, ''Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Cayman Islands'' (2nd edn, 2007, {{ISBN|1-74059-897-0}}), p. 99</ref> Grand Cayman also has several shipwrecks off its shores, including one deliberate one. On 30 September 1994 the {{USS|Kittiwake|ASR-13|6}} was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register. In November 2008 her ownership was transferred for an undisclosed amount to the government of the Cayman Islands, which had decided to sink the ''Kittiwake'' in June 2009 to form a new artificial reef off Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman. Following several delays, the ship was finally scuttled according to plan on 5 January 2011. The ''Kittiwake'' has become a dynamic environment for marine life. While visitors are not allowed to take anything, there are endless sights. Each of the five decks of the ship offers squirrelfish, rare sponges, Goliath groupers, urchins, and more. Experienced and beginner divers are invited to swim around the ''Kittiwake''.<ref>[http://www.caymanislands.ky/activities/attractions/kittiwake.aspx Kittiwake | Cayman Dive, Cayman Islands Vacation | Cayman Islands].

Other Grand Cayman tourist attractions include: the ironshore landscape of [[Hell, Grand Cayman|Hell]]; the {{convert|23|acre|m2|adj=on}} marine theme park "[[Cayman Turtle Centre]]: Island Wildlife Encounter", previously known as "Boatswain's Beach"; the production of gourmet [[sea salt]]; and the [[Mastic Reserve|Mastic Trail]], a hiking trail through the forests in the centre of the island.

Another attraction to visit on Grand Cayman is the Observation Tower, located in Camana Bay. The Observation Tower is 75 feet tall and provides 360-degree views across Seven Mile Beach, George Town, the North Sound, and beyond. It is free to the public and climbing the tower has become a popular thing to do in the Cayman Islands.<ref>[http://www.camanabay.com/the-town/play/observation-tower/ Observation Tower | Camana Bay] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906050117/http://www.camanabay.com/the-town/play/observation-tower/ |date=6 September 2014 }}.

===Shipping===
{{As of|2015|12|31}} 360 commercial vessels and 1,674 pleasure craft were registered in the Cayman Islands totaling 4.3 million [[gross tonnage|GT]].<ref>{{cite web |title=CI shipping 2015/2016 annual report page 22 |url=https://www.cishipping.com/system/files/reports/documents/Annual%20Report%202015-2016%2008JAN18.pdf |website=cishipping.com |access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref>

===Labour===
The Cayman Islands has a population of 68,076 ({{As of|2019|lc=y}}) and therefore a limited workforce.<ref name="eso"/> [[Work permit]]s may, therefore, be granted to foreigners. On average, there have been more than 21,000 foreigners holding valid work permits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eso.ky/pages.php?page=immigrationdata |title=Work Permit Stats |publisher=Eso.ky |date=30 March 2007 |access-date=31 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722142647/http://www.eso.ky/pages.php?page=immigrationdata |archive-date=22 July 2011 }}</ref>

====Work permits for non-citizens====
To work in the Cayman Islands as a [[alien (law)|non-citizen]], a work permit is required. This involves passing a police background check and a health check. A prospective immigrant worker will not be granted a permit unless certain medical conditions are met, including testing negative for [[syphilis]] and [[HIV]]. A permit may be granted to individuals on special work.

A foreigner must first have a job to move to the Cayman Islands. The employer applies and pays for the work permit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ky/portal/page?_pageid=1142,1592726&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |title=C.I. Government Website – Entry Requirements for Work Permits |publisher=Gov.ky |access-date=31 July 2011}}</ref> Work permits are not granted to foreigners who are in the Cayman Islands (unless it is a renewal). The Cayman Islands Immigration Department requires foreigners to remain out of the country until their work permit has been approved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.island-search.com/browse.php?cat=1748 |title=Online Employment Resources |publisher=Island-search.com |access-date=31 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810225849/http://www.island-search.com/browse.php?cat=1748 |archive-date=10 August 2011 }}</ref>

The Cayman Islands presently imposes a controversial "rollover" in relation to [[expatriate]] workers who require a work permit. Non-Caymanians are only permitted to reside and work within the territory for a maximum of nine years unless they satisfy the criteria of key employees. Non-Caymanians who are "rolled over" may return to work additional nine-year periods, subject to a one-year gap between their periods of work. The policy has been the subject of some controversy within the press. Law firms have been particularly upset by the recruitment difficulties that it has caused.<ref>[http://www.caymannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000106/010674.htm Row brews over rollover], 22 January 2007, Cayman net News {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205055501/http://www.caymannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000106/010674.htm |date=5 February 2009 }}</ref> Other less well-remunerated employment sectors have been affected as well. Concerns about safety have been expressed by diving instructors, and realtors have also expressed concerns. Others support the rollover as necessary to protect Caymanian identity in the face of immigration of large numbers of expatriate workers.<ref>[http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1011499 Government takes up permit issue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914224909/http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1011499 |date=14 September 2007 }}, Editorial, 5 March 2006, Camanian Compass</ref>

Concerns have been expressed that in the long term, the policy may damage the preeminence of the Cayman Islands as an [[offshore financial centre]] by making it difficult to recruit and retain experienced staff from onshore financial centres. Government employees are no longer exempt from this "rollover" policy, according to this report in a local newspaper.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1024210 |title = Cayman Islands – Cay Compass News Online – Rollover for civil servants |access-date = 23 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080306101403/http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1024210 |archive-date = 6 March 2008 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> The governor has used his constitutional powers, which give him absolute control over the disposition of [[civil service]] employees, to determine which expatriate civil servants are dismissed after seven years service and which are not.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

This policy is incorporated in the Immigration Law (2003 revision), written by the United Democratic Party government, and subsequently enforced by the People's Progressive Movement Party government. Both governments agree to the term limits on foreign workers, and the majority of Caymanians also agree it is necessary to protect local culture and heritage from being eroded by a large number of foreigners gaining residency and citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.caymanobserver.com/viewarticle.cfm?id=36&Section=LocalNews |title = Cayman Observer |access-date = 23 June 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170131190919/http://www.caymanobserver.com/viewarticle.cfm?id=36&Section=LocalNews |archive-date = 31 January 2017 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

The Cabinet is composed of two official members and seven elected members, called Ministers; one of whom is designated [[Premier of the Cayman Islands|Premier]]. The Premier can serve for two consecutive terms after which he or she is barred from attaining the office again. Although an MLA can only be Premier twice any person who meets the qualifications and requirements for a seat in the Parliament can be elected to the Parliament indefinitely.<ref>The Constitution of the Cayman Islands, Part VI The Legislature</ref>

There are two official members of the Parliament, the [[deputy governor|Deputy Governor]] and the [[attorney general|Attorney General]]. They are appointed by the Governor in accordance with Her Majesty's instructions, and although they have seats in the Parliament, under the 2009 Constitution, they do not vote. They serve in a professional and advisory role to the MLAs, the Deputy Governor represents the Governor who is a representative of the Queen and the British Government. While the Attorney General serves to advise on legal matters and has special responsibilities in the LA, he is generally responsible for changes to the Penal code among other things.

The seven Ministers are voted into office by the 19 elected members of the [[Parliament of the Cayman Islands]]. One of the Ministers, the leader of the majority political party, is appointed Premier by the Governor.

After consulting the Premier, the Governor allocates a portfolio of responsibilities to each Cabinet Minister. Under the principle of collective responsibility, all Ministers are obliged to support in the Parliament any measures approved by Cabinet.

Almost 80 departments, sections and units carry out the business of government, joined by a number of statutory boards and authorities set up for specific purposes, such as the Port Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Immigration Board, the Water Authority, the University College Board of Governors, the National Pensions Board and the Health Insurance Commission.

Since 2000, there have been two official major political parties: The [[United Democratic Party (Cayman Islands)|Cayman Democratic Party]] (CDP) and the [[People's Progressive Movement (Cayman Islands)|People's Progressive Movement]] (PPM). While there has been a shift to political parties, many contending for office still run as independents. The two parties are notably similar, though they consider each other rivals in most cases, their differences are generally in personality and implementation rather than actual policy. The Cayman Islands currently lacks any real liberal or progressive representation in the Parliament or in the form of organized political parties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://portal.elections.ky/files/downloads/2017/Register-of-Political-Parties-14-March-2017.pdf|title=Official Register of Political Parties|date=29 August 2018|website=Cayman Islands Elections Office|access-date=29 August 2018}}</ref> As of the May 2017 General Election, members of the PPM and CDP have joined together with 3 independent members to form a government coalition despite many years of enmity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2017/05/31/premier-mclaughlin-to-lead-13-member-coalition-government/|title=Premier McLaughlin to lead 13-member coalition government|date=31 May 2017|work=Cayman Compass|access-date=29 August 2018}}</ref>

===Law enforcement===

The law enforcement in the country is provided chiefly by the RCIPS or [[Royal Cayman Islands Police Service]] and the CICBC or Cayman Islands Customs & Border Control. These two agencies co-operate in aspects of law enforcement, including their [[Royal Cayman Islands Police Service#Joint Marine Unit|joint marine unit]].<ref>https://www.rcips.ky/</ref> <ref>http://cbc.gov.ky/</ref>

===Military and defence===

The defence of the Cayman Islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom.

====Cayman Regiment====
{{Main|Cayman Regiment}}
On 12 October 2019, the government announced the formation of the [[Cayman Regiment]], a new [[British Armed Forces]] unit. The Cayman Regiment was planned to become operational in 2020, with an initial 35-50 personnel of mostly reservists that are locally recruited and likely initially trained as engineers and expected growth of an increase of personnel to several hundred. <ref>https://www.caymancompass.com/2019/10/13/cayman-regiment-would-provide-disaster-relief/</ref><ref>https://www.caymancompass.com/2019/10/11/uk-minister-announces-cayman-regiment-for-emergency-relief/</ref> <ref>https://caymannewsservice.com/2019/10/cayman-to-create-military-regiment/</ref>

In mid-December 2019, recruitment for commanding officers and junior officers began, with the commanding officers expected to begin work in Jan 2020 and the junior officers expected to begin in February 2020.<ref>http://www.gov.ky/portal/page/portal/cighome/pressroom/archive/201912/Regiment%20Begins%20Recruitment</ref>

In January 2020, the first officers were chosen for the Cayman Regiment.<ref>https://www.caymancompass.com/2020/01/30/regiment-senior-officers-appointed/</ref>

====Cadet Corps====
The [[Cayman Islands Cadet Corps]] was formed in March 2001 and carries out military-type training with teenage citizens of the country.<ref>https://www.cicadetcorps.ky/</ref>

====Coast Guard====
As of 2018 the PPM led Coalition government have pledged to form a Coast Guard to protect the interests of the Islands, especially in terms of illegal immigration and illegal drug importation as well as Search and Rescue.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

in Mid 2018 the Commander and 2nd in Command of the Cayman Islands Coast Guard were appointed. The First Commanding officer Appointed is Commander Robert Scotland and Second In Command Lieutenant Commander Leo Anglin <ref>https://caymannewsservice.com/2018/08/cayman-islands-coast-guard-border-control/</ref> 

In Mid 2019 the Commander and 2nd in Command took part in international joint operations with the [[United States Coast Guard]] and the [[Jamaica Defence Force#JDF Coast Guard|Jamaica Defense Force Coast Guard]] called Operation Riptide. This making it first deployment for the Cayman Islands Coast Guard and first in 10 years any Cayman Representative has been on a foreign military ship for a counternarcotic operation.<ref>http://www.gov.ky/portal/page/portal/cighome/pressroom/archive/201907/CICG%20Deployed%20in%20International%20Joint%20Operation</ref>
<ref>https://www.ieyenews.com/wordpress/cayman-islands-coast-guard-deployed-in-international-joint-operation/</ref>

In late November 2019 it was announced that the Cayman Islands Coast Guard would become operational in January 2020, with initial total of 21 Coast Guardsman half of which would come from the [[Royal Cayman Islands Police Service#Joint Marine Unit|joint marine unit]], with further recruitment in the new year. One of the many taskings of the Coast Guard will be to push enforcement of all laws that apply to the designated Wildlife Interaction Zone <ref>https://caymannewsservice.com/2019/11/coastguard-to-manage-stingray-city/</ref>

===Taxation===
No direct taxation is imposed on residents and Cayman Islands companies. The government receives the majority of its income from indirect taxation. Duty is levied against most imported goods, which is typically in the range of 22% to 25%. Some items are exempted, such as baby formula, books, cameras and certain items are taxed at 5%. Duty on automobiles depends on their value. The duty can amount to 29.5% up to $20,000.00 KYD CIF (cost, insurance and freight) and up to 42% over $30,000.00 KYD CIF for expensive models. The government charges flat licensing fees on financial institutions that operate in the islands and there are work permit fees on foreign labour. A 13% government tax is placed on all tourist accommodations in addition to US$37.50 airport departure tax which is built into the cost of an airline ticket. There are no taxes on corporate profits, capital gains, or personal income. There are no estate or death inheritance taxes payable on Cayman Islands real estate or other assets held in the Cayman Islands.

The legend behind the lack of taxation comes from the [[Wreck of the Ten Sail]], when a British prince was supposedly involved in a shipwreck off the north coast of Grand Cayman. Luckily, a local spotted the shipwreck and swam to his help, rescuing the Prince and his crew. Since that day the Prince declared that in gratitude for his help - the citizens of the country of the Cayman Islands would never pay tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caymanresident.com/about/government-history-politics/early-cayman-history/1700-to-1900/|title=Cayman Islands History from 1700 to 1900 |publisher=caymanresident.com |date=16 December 2019 |access-date=16 December 2019}}</ref> There is, however, no documented evidence for this story, nor even that a British prince was involved in the shipwreck.

===Foreign relations===
[[File:1953caymanislands1poundelizabethIIblue.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Postage stamp with a portrait of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], 1953]]
{{main|Foreign relations of the Cayman Islands}}

Foreign policy is controlled by the United Kingdom, as the islands remain an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands' most important relationships were with Britain and [[Jamaica]], in recent years, as a result of economic dependence, a relationship with the United States has developed.

Though the Cayman Islands is involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for narcotics trafficking and [[money laundering]]. In an attempt to address this, the government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the [[Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty]] of 1986 with the United States, to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to co-operate with foreign investigators.

Due to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands has no representation either in the [[United Nations]] or in most other international organisations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organisations, being an associate member of [[Caricom]] and [[UNESCO]], and a member of a sub-bureau of [[Interpol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/United-Kingdom |title=United Kingdom / Europe / Member countries / Internet / Home – INTERPOL |publisher=Interpol.int |date=30 December 2012 |access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref>
