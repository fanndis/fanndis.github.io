==Overview==
As a ''[[grande école]]'', its admissions process is highly selective. Entry to Sciences Po Aix is conditioned by selection tests. The main test is designed for students who would like to join the institute as freshmen. Each year, there are more than 10 000 candidates. The selection rates are inferior to 10%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/education/article/2014/01/08/les-recommandations-du-jury-pour-entrer-en-iep_4344574_1473685.html|title=Les recommandations du jury pour entrer en IEP|date=2014-01-08|access-date=2019-12-05|language=fr}}</ref> Sciences Po Aix specializes in [[political sciences]]. Therefore, the institute offers courses in economics, history, law, international relations, social sciences and business.

The IEP provides students with a general training in law, economics, general knowledge and history. Its students are selected through a competitive entrance examination. Some of its students have become company directors or government officials. Many students move on to careers in journalism, finance, state administration, diplomacy or communications.

The academic course lasts five years. It is composed of a three-year undergraduate programme and a two-year graduate programme. The primary diploma is equivalent to a master's degree. The third year of the Sciences Po Aix curriculum is a year of mobility abroad. Students have the choice, they can spend two semesters in a foreign university, one semester in a university and one semester internship or they also have the opportunity to spend two semesters as a trainee.

Thereby, Sciences Po Aix have concluded more than 130 exchange partnerships with different universities around the globe so that Sciences Po students can study in many countries during their third year. All continents of the world are represented, there are some partnerships in the United States ([[Wellesley College]], [[Loyola University Chicago]], [[Arizona State University]], [[Florida International University]]...), in Canada ([[University of Montreal]], [[University of Ottawa]]) in South America ([[University of Buenos Aires]], [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]], in Africa ([[Rhodes University]]), in Asia ([[Shanghai International Studies University]], [[Hankuk University of Foreign Studies]] in Seoul, [[Waseda University]] in Tokyo), in Oceania ([[University of New South Wales]] in Sydney, [[University of Canterbury]]) and also in Europe ([[Free University of Berlin]], [[LUISS University]] in Roma, [[Middlesex University]] in London...).

==History==
Sciences Po Aix was established in 1956. It is the heir of the ''École Libre des Sciences Politiques'', created by Émile Boutmy in 1872, in response to a need for reform for the society and the republican state that has just been born, after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870.

In September 2007, [[Philippe Séguin]] (1943–2010), then President of the Court of Audit (in French [[Cour des comptes]]), was elected President of the Administration Council, succeeding [[Jean-Paul Proust]] (1940–2010), Minister of the Principality of [[Monaco]]. In July 2010, the former French minister of economy and current managing director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[Christine Lagarde]], member of the Administration Council since 2008 and 1977 graduate, was elected President.<ref>{{in lang|fr}}Communiqué de presse de l'IEP d'Aix-en-Provence, « Christine Lagarde succède à Philippe Séguin à la tête du CA de Sciences Po Aix» {{cite web |url=http://www.iep.univ-cezanne.fr/media/newsletter2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425083907/http://www.iep.univ-cezanne.fr/media/newsletter2.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 }}</ref>
