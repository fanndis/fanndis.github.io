'''DVD-Video''' is a consumer video format used to store digital video on [[DVD]] discs. DVD-Video was the dominant consumer home video format in [[Asia]], [[North America]],<ref>{{cite web | first=Anna | last=Bakalis | title = It's Unreel: DVD Rentals Overtake Videocassettes | work = [[The Washington Times]] | date = 2003-06-20 | url = http://washingtontimes.com/business/20030620-113258-1104r.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-17 }}</ref> [[Europe]], and [[Australia]] in the 2000s until it was supplanted by the high-definition [[Blu-ray]] Disc. Discs using the DVD-Video specification require a DVD drive and an [[MPEG-2]] decoder (e. g., a DVD player, or a computer DVD drive with a software DVD player). Commercial DVD movies are encoded using a combination MPEG-2 compressed video and audio of varying formats (often multi-channel formats as described below). Typically, the data rate for DVD movies ranges from 3 [[Data-rate units|Mbit/s]] to 9.5 Mbit/s, and the [[bit rate]] is usually adaptive. DVD-Video was first available in Japan on November 1, 1996 (with major releases beginning December 20, 1996),<ref name="jimtayfaq"/> followed by a release on March 24, <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS DATE UNLESS THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES SAYING OTHERWISE. --> 1997 in the United States—to line up with the [[69th Academy Awards]] that same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,841,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970411035822/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,841,00.html|title=Oscar Day Is Also DVD Day|accessdate=August 21, 2019|first=Jeff B.|last=Copeland|work=E!

The DVD-Video specification was created by [[DVD Forum]] and can be obtained from DVD Format/Logo Licensing Corporation for a fee of $5,000.<ref name="dvdbook-subscribe">DVD FLLC (2009) [http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/format/f_nosbsc.html "DVD Format Book"].

== Video data ==
To record digital video, DVD-Video uses either [[H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2]] compression at up to 9.8 [[Data-rate units|Mbit/s]] (9,800 [[Data-rate units|kbit/s]]) or [[MPEG-1#Part 2: Video|MPEG-1 Part 2]] compression at up to 1.856 Mbit/s (1,856 kbit/s). DVD-Video supports video with a [[color depth|bit depth]] of 8 bits per color [[YCbCr]] with 4:2:0 [[chroma subsampling]].<ref name=AudioholicsHDMIApril2008>{{cite news |title=HDMI Enhanced Black Levels, xvYCC and RGB |author=Clint DeBoer |publisher=[[Audioholics]] |url=http://www.audioholics.com/tweaks/calibrate-your-system/hdmi-black-levels-xvycc-rgb |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2013-06-02}}</ref><ref name=TelairityDigitalColorCodingPDF>{{cite news |title=Digital Color Coding |publisher=Telairity |url=http://www.telairity.com/assets/downloads/Digital%20Color%20Coding.pdf |accessdate=2013-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107171831/http://www.telairity.com/assets/downloads/Digital%20Color%20Coding.pdf |archive-date=January 7, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The following formats are allowed for H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 video:<ref name="videohelp">{{cite web| url=http://www.videohelp.com/dvd| title=What is DVD?| publisher=Videohelp.com| accessdate=2011-10-16}}{{better source|date=July 2012|reason=The currently cited source does not mention 24000/1001 fps, common among NTSC DVDs. Also, it lacks any PAR information (i.e. reference to the fact that pixels are not square on DVDs)}}</ref>
* At a display rate of 25 [[Frame rate|frames per second]], [[Interlaced video|interlaced]] (commonly used in regions with [[576i|50 Hz image scanning]] frequency):
: 720 × 576 pixels (same resolution as [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]])
: 704 × 576 pixels 
: 352 × 576 pixels (same as the [[China Video Disc]] standard)
: 352 × 288 pixels
* At a display rate of 29.97 frames per second, interlaced (commonly used in regions with [[480i|60 Hz image scanning]] frequency):
: 720 × 480 pixels (same resolution as [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]]).
: 704 × 480 pixels
: 352 × 480 pixels (same as the [[Super Video CD|China Video Disc]] standard).
: 352 × 240 pixels

The following formats are allowed for MPEG-1 video:
* 352 × 288 pixels at 25 frame/s, [[Progressive scan|progressive]] (Same as the [[Video cd|VCD]] Standard)
* 352 × 240 pixels at 29.97 frame/s, progressive (Same as the [[Video cd|VCD]] Standard)

Video with 4:3 frame [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] is supported in all video modes. [[anamorphic DVD|Widescreen]] video is supported only in D-1 resolutions.

The MPEG-1 Part 2 format does not support interlaced video. The H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 format supports both interlaced and progressive-scan content{{clarify|date=February 2017}}. Content with a frame rate different from one of the rates shown above can be encoded to H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 by using [[Telecine#Frame rate differences|pulldown]]. This is most commonly used to encode 23.976 frame/s content for playback at 29.97 frame/s. Pulldown can be implemented directly while the disc is mastered, by actually encoding the data on the disc at 29.97 frames/s; however, this practice is uncommon for most commercial film releases, which provide content optimized for display on progressive-scan television sets.

Alternately, the content can be encoded on the disc itself at one of several alternate frame rates, and use flags that identify scanning type, field order and field repeating pattern. Such flags can be added in video stream by the H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 encoder. A DVD player uses these flags to convert progressive content into interlaced video in real time during playback, producing a signal suitable for interlaced TV sets. These flags also allow reproducing progressive content at their original, non-interlaced format when used with compatible DVD players and progressive-scan television sets.<ref>[http://hometheaterhifi.com/technical/technical-reviews/dvd-benchmark-part-5-progressive-scan-dvd/ "DVD Benchmark – Part 5 – Progressive Scan DVD"].</ref><ref>[http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_9_2/mrg-87-june-2002.html#A%20Beautiful%20Mind "Home Theater High Fidelity: A Beautiful Mind, Review"].</ref>

==Audio data ==

The audio data on a DVD movie can be [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]], [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] (MP2), or [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3) format. In countries using the [[PAL]] system standard DVD-Video releases must contain at least one audio track using the PCM, MP2, or AC-3 format, and all standard PAL players must support all three of these formats. A similar standard exists in countries using the [[NTSC]] system, though with no requirement mandating the use of or support for the MP2 format. DTS audio is optional for all players, as DTS was not part of the initial draft standard and was added later; thus, many early players are unable to play DTS audio tracks. Only PCM and DTS support 96&nbsp;kHz sampling rate. Because PCM, being uncompressed, requires a lot of bandwidth and DTS is not universally supported by players, AC-3 is the most common digital audio format for DVDs, and 96&nbsp;kHz is rare on a DVD. The official allowed formats for the audio tracks on a DVD-Video are:
* PCM: 48&nbsp;kHz or 96&nbsp;kHz sampling rate, 16 bit or 24 bit [[Pulse-code modulation|Linear PCM]], 2 to 6 channels, up to 6,144 kbit/s; N. B. 16-bit 48&nbsp;kHz 8 channel PCM is allowed by the DVD-Video specification but is not well-supported by authoring applications or players;
* AC-3: 48&nbsp;kHz sampling rate, 1 to 5.1 (6) channels, up to 448 kbit/s;
* DTS: 48&nbsp;kHz or 96&nbsp;kHz sampling rate; channel layouts = 2.0, 2.1, 5.0, 5.1, 6.1; bitrates for 2.0 and 2.1 = 377.25 and 503.25 kbit/s, bitrates for 5.x and 6.1 = 754.5 and 1509.75 kbit/s;<ref>http://www.audiorents.com/library/specsheets/4_dts-cae-4_cad-4_encode-decode.pdf</ref>
* MP2: 48&nbsp;kHz sampling rate, 1 to [[MPEG Multichannel|7.1 channels]], up to 912 kbit/s.

DVDs can contain more than one channel of audio to go together with the video content, supporting a maximum of eight simultaneous audio tracks per video. This is most commonly used for different audio formats—DTS 5.1, AC-3 2.0 etc.—as well as for commentary and audio tracks in different languages.

== Data rate ==
DVD-Video discs have a raw bitrate of 11.08 Mbit/s, with a 1.0 Mbit/s overhead, leaving a payload bitrate of 10.08 Mbit/s. Of this, up to 3.36 Mbit/s can be used for subtitles, a maximum of 10.08 Mbit/s can be split amongst audio and video, and a maximum of 9.80 Mbit/s can be used for video alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://documentation.apple.com/en/dvdstudiopro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=4%26section=6|title=DVD Studio Pro 4 User Manual|work=apple.com|access-date=October 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107173754/http://documentation.apple.com/en/dvdstudiopro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=4%26section=6|archive-date=January 7, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the case of multiple angles the data is stored interleaved, and so there is a bitrate penalty leading to a max bitrate of 8 Mbit/s per angle to compensate for additional seek time. This limit is not cumulative, so each additional angle can still have up to 8 Mbit/s of bitrate available.

Professionally encoded videos average a bitrate of 4–5 Mbit/s with a maximum of 7–8 Mbit/s in high-action scenes. Encoding at less than the max bitrate (like this) is typically done to allow greater compatibility among players,<ref>https://documentation.apple.com/en/dvdstudiopro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=4%26section=6 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107173754/http://documentation.apple.com/en/dvdstudiopro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=4%26section=6 |date=January 7, 2016 }} "some dvd players cannot sustain high max bitrate" though note also they still encode video at 8 Mbps</ref> and to help prevent [[buffer underrun]]s in the case of dirty or scratched discs

Aiming to improve picture quality over standard editions, [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment]] offered "[[Superbit]]"—a premium line of DVD-Video titles having average bitrates closer to 6 Mbit/s. Audio quality was also improved by the mandatory inclusion of both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 surround audio tracks. Multiple languages, angles, and extra audio tracks were eliminated to free up more space for the main title and thereby to ensure the highest data rate possible. In January 2007 the Superbit line was discontinued.

== Other features ==
Some DVD hardware or software players may play discs whose MPEG files do not conform to the above standards; commonly this is used to support discs authored with formats such as [[Video CD|VCD]] and [[Super Video CD|SVCD]]. While VCD and [[Super Video CD|CVD]] video is supported by the DVD standard, neither SVCD video nor VCD, CVD, or SVCD audio is compatible with the DVD standard.

Some hardware players will also play DVD-ROMs or [[CD-ROM]]s containing "raw" MPEG video files; these are "unauthored" and lack the [[Computer file|file]] and header structure that defines DVD-Video. Standard DVD-Video files contain extra information (such as the number of video tracks, chapters and links to extra features) that DVD players use to navigate the disc.

The maximum chapters allowed per title is 99 and the maximum titles allowed per DVD is 99.

=== File system ===
Almost all DVD-Video discs use the ''UDF bridge'' format, which is a combination of the DVD MicroUDF (a subset of [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] 1.02) and [[ISO 9660]] file systems.<ref name="dvd-books-overview" /><ref name="demystified">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#4.2 |title=DVD Demystified – What Are the Features and Speeds of DVD Drives? |accessdate=2011-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822172353/http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#4.2 |archive-date=August 22, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/creating-dvds.html#AEN23376 |title=FreeBSD Handbook – Burning a DVD-Video |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>
The UDF bridge format provides backwards compatibility for operating systems that support only ISO 9660.<ref name="demystified" /> Most DVD players read the UDF filesystem from a DVD-Video disc and ignore the ISO9660 filesystem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cdburnerxp.se/help/Appendices/filesystem |title=CDBurnerXP Help – File System |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>

=== Directory and file structure ===
A DVD volume for the DVD-Video format has the following structure of directories and files:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html |title=DVD-Video Information – Video Manager and Video Title Set IFO file headers |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manifest-tech.com/links/dvd_terms.htm |title=DVD Authoring Terminology |series=Terminology |author=Douglas Dixon|accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>

** ... etc.

[[VOB|IFO]] files store control and playback information—e. g. information about chapters, subtitles and audio tracks. They do not store any video or audio data or subtitles.

[[VOB|BUP]] files are only backups of the IFO files.

==== Domains ====
Data structures recorded on a DVD-compliant disc are components of one of the four data groups called domains:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvd-replica.com/DVD/domains.php |title=Domains and System Space |author=DVD-Replica Media |accessdate=2011-02-26 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731001128/http://www.dvd-replica.com/DVD/domains.php |archive-date=July 31, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpucoder.com/Muxman/mxp/pgc.shtml |title=Muxman MXP Files – PGC Object |author=MPUCoder |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/chapters/index.html |title=Menu Features – DVD Menu |author=Matroska |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/Helppro/vts.htm |title=VTS, VMG and other stuff |author=Mediachance |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>

* Video Title Set Menu (VTSM) – uses "VTS_zz_0.VOB" files

=== Container ===
{{Main|VOB}}
Video, audio, subtitle and navigation streams are [[Multiplexing|multiplexed]] and stored on a DVD-Video disc in the [[VOB]] [[Digital container format|container format]] (Video Object). VOB is based on the [[MPEG program stream]] format, but with additional limitations and specifications in the private streams.<ref name="whatisvob">[http://www.mpucoder.com/DVD/vobov.html "What Is a VOB File"].

VOB files are a very strict subset of the MPEG program stream standard. While all VOB files are MPEG program streams, not all MPEG program streams comply with the definition for a VOB file.<ref name="whatisvob" />

[[DVD recorder]]s can use [[DVD-VR]] or [[DVD+VR]] format instead of DVD-Video. DVD-VR format store multiplexed audiovisual content in VRO containers.<ref name="VRO">DVD Demystified (July 13, 2009) [http://dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#4.10 "What Are .IFO, .VOB, .AOB, and .VRO files?

{{See also|DVD-VR|DVD+VR}}

=== Subtitles ===
DVD-Video may also include up to 32 [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]] or ''subpicture'' tracks. Subtitles are usually intended as a visual help for the [[Hearing loss|deaf and hearing impaired]] and for translating dialogs.

Subtitles can serve other purposes as well. For example, in the DVD release of ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' one of the subtitle tracks includes history notes, giving additional information timed to the events depicted in the film. In the release of ''[[For All Mankind]]'' subtitles display names of the NASA missions and names of the people shown on the screen. ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' also features trivia facts about the making of the film on its subtitles menu.

Subtitles are stored as [[bitmap]] images and therefore can contain messages in any language. Subtitles are restricted to four colors, including transparent "color", and thus tend to look cruder than permanent subtitles on film.<ref>[http://www.sonic.com/products/Consumer/CinePlayer/Technology/variability.aspx CinePlayer Variability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226130428/http://www.sonic.com/products/Consumer/CinePlayer/Technology/variability.aspx |date=February 26, 2008 }}, Sonic.</ref> Transparency allows laying subtitles over the video during playback.<ref name="dvd-subtitles">MPEG.org (July 21, 1996) [http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/DVD/Book_B/Subpic.html "DVD Technical Notes{{spaced ndash}} Subpictures"].Retrieved 2009-07-24.</ref> The subtitle tracks are contained within the [[VOB]] file of the DVD.

DVD-Video may also contain [[closed captioning]] material which can only be viewed on a television set with a decoder.

=== Chapters and angles ===
DVD-Video may contain chapters for easy navigation, and continuation of a partially watched film. If space permits, it is also possible to include several versions of certain scenes, called "angles." Today, the multi-angle feature is mostly used for internationalization. For example, it can be used to supply different language versions of images containing written text when subtitles would not do (e. g., the Queen's spell book in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'', and the scrolling text in the openings of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films). Multiple angles have found a niche in markets such as [[yoga]], [[erotica]] and live performances.

=== Extra features ===
A significant selling point of DVD-Video is that the storage capacity allows for a wide variety of extra, or bonus, features in addition to the feature film. These extra features can include [[audio commentary]]; [[Documentary film|documentary]] features, commonly about the making of the main title; [[interview]]s; [[deleted scene|deleted footage]]; [[outtake]]s; photo galleries; [[storyboard]]s; isolated [[film score|music scores]]; trivia text commentary; simple games; [[Short film|film shorts]]; [[Television advertisement|TV spots]]; [[Radio advertisement|radio spots]]; [[Trailer (promotion)|theatrical trailers]] which were used to promote the main title; and [[Teaser campaign|teaser trailers]] advertising related movies or DVDs.

Extra features often provide entertainment or add depth and understanding to the film. Games, [[blooper]]s, and galleries provide entertainment. Deleted scenes and alternative endings allow the audience to view additional content which was not included in a theatrical release. Directors cuts allow the audience to see how the director envisioned the main title without the constraints which are placed on a theatrical release.

Other extras that can be included on DVDs are motion menus, still pictures, up to 32 selectable subtitles, [[seamless branching]] for multiple storylines, up to 9 camera angles, and DVD-ROM / data files that can be accessed on a computer.

Extra features require additional storage space, which often means encoding the main title with lower than possible data rate to fit both the main title and the extras on one disc. Lower data rate may decrease visual and sound quality, which manifests itself in various [[compression artifact]]s. To maintain quality the main title and the extras may be released on several discs, or the extras may be omitted completely like in the "[[Superbit]]" line of DVDs.

DVD-Video has four complementary systems designed to restrict the DVD user in various ways: [[Macrovision]], [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS), [[regional lockout|region codes]], and [[User operation prohibition|disabled user operations]] (UOPs). There are also anti-ripping techniques intended to foil [[DVD ripper|ripping software]].

=== Content Scramble System ===
{{Main|Content Scramble System}}
Many DVD-Video titles use Content Scramble System (CSS) encryption, which is intended to discourage people from copying the disc. Usually, users need to install software provided on the DVD or downloaded from the Internet such as [[MPlayer]], [[Arcsoft TotalMedia Theatre|TotalMedia Theatre]], [[PowerDVD]], [[VLC media player|VLC]] or [[WinDVD]] to be able to view the disc in a computer system.

CSS does not make it difficult (any more) to copy the digital content now that a decoder ([[DeCSS]]) has been released, nor is it possible to distinguish between legal and illegal copies of a work, but CSS does restrict the playback software that may be used.

CSS has caused major problems for the inclusion of DVD players in any [[Open-source software|open source]] operating systems, since open source player implementations are not officially given access to the decryption keys or license to the [[patent]]s involved in CSS. [[Proprietary software]] players were also difficult to find on some platforms. However, a successful effort has been made to write a decoder by [[reverse engineering]], resulting in [[DeCSS]]. This has led to long-running legal battles and the arrest of some of those involved in creating or distributing the DeCSS code,<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> through the use of the controversial U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), on the grounds that such software could also be used to facilitate unauthorized copying of the data on the discs. The [[Videolan]] team, however, went on to make the [[libdvdcss]] library. Unlike DeCSS, libdvdcss can access a CSS-encrypted DVD without the need of a cracked key, thus enabling playback of such discs on opensource players without legal restraints (although DVD rippers using this library may still be subject to restrictions).

The DMCA currently affects only the [[United States]], however many other countries are signatories to the similar [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Treaty]]. In some countries it is not illegal to use de-scrambling software to bypass the DVD restrictions. A [[List of video players (software)|number of software programs]] have since appeared on the Web to view DVDs on a number of different platforms.

Other measures such as anti-ripping, as well as U.S. and non-U.S. [[copyright]] law, may be used to prevent making unauthorized copies of DVDs. CSS decrypting software, or ripping software, such as [[DVD Decrypter]], [[AnyDVD]], [[MacTheRipper]], and [[DVD Shrink]] allows a disc to be copied to hard disk unscrambled. Some DeCSS applications also remove [[Macrovision]], [[regional lockout|region codes]], and disabled user operations (UOPs).

=== Anti-ripping ===
After DeCSS ripping software became available, companies developed techniques to introduce errors in DVD-Video discs that do not normally affect playback and navigation of a disc, but can cause problems in software that attempts to copy the entire disc. These approaches, which are not part of the official DVD-Video specification, include Sony [[ARccOS Protection]], Macrovision [[Macrovision#RipGuard|RipGuard]], [[X-protect]], ProtectDisc [[SecureBurn]], Anaho,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anahoproductions.com|title=ANAHO HOME|work=anahoproductions.com}}</ref> Fortium, and others. All of these methods have been circumvented (as might have been expected, since all standard DVD players naturally circumvent them to play and navigate the discs normally). [[Riplock]] is a feature that reduces drive noise during playback but inadvertently reduces ripping speed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

=== Disabled user operations ===
{{Main|User operation prohibition}}
DVD-Video allows the disc to specify whether or not the user may perform any operation, such as selecting a menu, skipping chapters, forwarding or rewinding{{spaced ndash}} essentially any function on the remote control. This is known as User Operation Prohibitions, or Prohibited User Operations (UOPs or PUOs). Most DVD players respect these commands (e. g., by preventing skipping or fast-forwarding through a copyright message or an advertisement at the beginning of a disc). However, [[grey market]] players ignore UOPs and some DVD "re-authoring" software packages allow the user to produce a copy without these restrictions. The legality of these activities varies by jurisdiction and is the subject of debate. (See [[fair use]].)

=== Region codes ===
{{Main|DVD region code}}
[[File:DVD-Regions with key-2.svg|thumb|right|300px|DVD region codes across the world]]
Each DVD-Video disc contains one or more region codes, denoting the area(s) of the world in which distribution and playback are intended. The commercial DVD player specification dictates that a player must only play discs that contain its region code. In theory, this allows the motion picture studios to control the various aspects of a release (including content, date and price) on a region-by-region basis, or ensure the success of "staggered" or delayed cinema releases from country to country. For example, the British movie ''[[28 Days Later]]'' was released on DVD in Europe several months prior to the film's release in North American movie theaters. Regional coding kept the European DVD unplayable for most North American consumers, thereby ensuring that ticket sales would be relatively unaffected. <!-- Not a good example because the British DVD would be in PAL format, so most US consumers would not be able to use it in any event, regardless of region-encoding. -->

In practice, many DVD players allow playback of any disc, or can be modified to do so. Entirely independent of encryption, region coding pertains to [[regional lockout]], which originated in the [[video game]] industry.

From a worldwide perspective regional coding may be seen as a failure.<ref>{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Rubens | title = Border controls crumble in DVD land | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2002-08-19 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2000/dot_life/2197548.stm | accessdate = 2007-07-09}}</ref> A huge percentage of players outside of North America can be easily modified (and are even sold pre-modified by mainstream stores such as Amazon.co.uk) to ignore the regional codes on a disc. This, coupled with the fact that almost all televisions in Europe and [[Australasia]] are capable of displaying NTSC video (at the very least, in black and white), means that consumers in these regions have a huge choice of discs. Contrary to popular belief, this practice is not illegal and in some countries that strongly support free trade it is encouraged.

A normal DVD player can only play region-coded discs designated for the player's own particular region. However, a code-free or region-free DVD player is capable of playing DVDs from any of the six regions around the world.

The [[Content Scramble System|CSS]] license prohibits manufacturing of DVD players that are not set to a single region by default. While the same license prohibits manufacturers from including prominent interfaces to change the region setting it does not clearly prevent them from including "hidden" menus that enable the player's region to be changed; as such, many high-end models in the U.S. include password-protected or otherwise hidden methods to enable multi-region playback. Conversely in the UK and Ireland many cheap DVD players are multi-region while more expensive systems, including the majority of [[home cinema]] systems, are preset to play only region 2 discs.

In China, DVD-Videos for [[television series]] are usually released in MPEG-1 video, with MP2 audio. By forgoing Dolby standards, manufacturers cut costs considerably; encoding in lower bit-rates also allows a TV series to be squeezed onto fewer discs. There is no region coding in such cases.

There are also two additional region codes, region 7, which is reserved, and region 8, which is used exclusively for passenger transport such as airlines and cruise ships.

== Programming interface ==
A [[virtual machine]] implemented by the DVD player runs [[bytecode]] contained on the DVD. This is used to control playback and display special effects on the menus. The [[instruction set]] is called the Virtual Machine (VM) DVD command set. There are 16 general parameter registers (GPRM) to hold temporary values and 24 system parameters (SPRM). As a result of a moderately flexible programming interface, DVD players can be used to play games, such as the DVD re-release of ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'', along with more sophisticated and advanced games such as ''[[Scene It?]]'', all of which can be run on standard DVD players.

== Players and recorders ==
{{Main|DVD player|DVD recorder}}
Modern [[DVD recorder]]s often support additional formats, including DVD+/-R/RW, CD-R/RW, [[MP3]], [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]], [[Super Video CD|SVCD]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], [[Karaoke|KAR]] and [[MPEG-4]] ([[DivX]]/[[Xvid]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdrecorderworld.com/articles/choosing_a_dvd_recorder.php|title=DVD Recorder Formats dvdrecorderworld.com|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref> Some also include [[USB]] ports or [[flash memory]] readers. Player prices range from as low as [[United States dollar|US$]]20 ([[Pound sterling|£]]10){{Citation needed|reason=Amazon is hardly an authoritative source and these prices do not match the source quoted anyway|date=July 2008}} to as high as US$2,700 (£1,350).{{Citation needed|reason=Amazon is hardly an authoritative source and these prices do not match the source quoted anyway|date=July 2008}}

DVD drives for computers usually come with one of two kinds of [[Regional Playback Control]] (RPC), either RPC-1 or RPC-2. This is used to enforce the publisher's restrictions on what regions of the world the DVD can be played. (See [[Regional lockout]] and [[DVD region code]]s.) While [[open-source software]] DVD players allow everything, commercial ones (both standalone models and software players) come further encumbered with restrictions forbidding the viewer from skipping (or in some cases fast-forwarding) certain content such as copyright warnings or advertisements. (See [[User operation prohibition]].)

[[Video game]] systems with DVD-Video playback functionality include: [[Panasonic Q]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation 5]], [[Wii]] (with an unsupported hack),<ref>{{cite news

=== Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD ===
{{See also|High definition optical disc format war }}
Two competing high-definition (HD) optical-disc formats, [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], were introduced in 2006. The HD DVD format, promoted by Toshiba, had the backing by the [[DVD Forum]], which voted to make it the official successor to DVD. Opposing HD DVD was the Blu-ray format, led by the [[Blu-ray Disc Association]], which shares many members with the DVD forum.

With HD DVD launched in March 2006 and Blu-ray launched in June of the same year, a [[format war]] started. Industry analysts likened the situation to the [[Videotape format war|VHS/Betamax format war]] of the 1980s. At the time of their launch, consumer awareness of either high-definition format was severely limited, with the end result that most consumers avoided both formats, already content with DVD. In February 2008, Toshiba capitulated, citing low demand for HD DVD and the faster growth of Blu-ray, and the inclusion of the format in the video game system [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3), among other reasons.<ref>{{cite web |title=E-commerce and Vídeo Distribution:DVD and Blu-ray |url=http://ecommerceandvideodistributiondvd.blogspot.com/}}</ref> Toshiba ended production of their HD DVD players and discontinued promotion of the format, while the HD DVD movie release schedule concluded by June 2008.

After HD DVD was discontinued, Blu-ray became the ''de facto'' high-definition optical disc format. However, sales figures suggest that DVD is in no immediate danger of disappearing. All standard DVDs will play on existing Blu-ray players, making the switch to Blu-ray much easier than the switch from VHS to DVD. Moreover, some labels are cutting back on Blu-ray Disc releases in favor of DVD-Video, claiming that low sales do not justify the more expensive Blu-ray Disc format.<ref name="region 1 s2">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Americans-Season-2/20387|title=The Americans – Fox Announces DVDs for 'The Complete 2nd Season'|publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com|first=David|last=Lambert|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=November 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207121852/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Americans-Season-2/20387|archivedate=December 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In addition, a growing number of hardware vendors are enhancing their Blu-ray players with Internet connectivity for subscription-based video downloads.

[[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] is the latest version available, supporting [[4K resolution]] content.

=== CBHD ===
{{Main|China Blue High-definition Disc}}
China Blue High-definition Disc (CBHD) was introduced in September 2007. This format is based on [[HD DVD]]. While the Blu-ray format is marketed internationally, CBHDs have sold significantly in the Chinese market.
