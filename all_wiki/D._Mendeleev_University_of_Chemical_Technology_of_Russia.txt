'''D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia''' is a [[public university]] based in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].<ref>http://www.muctr.ru/en/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109151210/http://www.muctr.ru/en/ |date=2017-01-09 }} University homepage in English</ref> It is the largest [[Higher education|higher educational institution]] and research center of [[chemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]] in Russia, and one of the largest in the world.

The university was founded in 1898 as a [[technical college]], based on a popular proposal by professors from the [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University|Imperial Moscow Technical School]] to specially train “Chemical and Mechanical Engineer Assistants” approved by the [[Moscow City Duma]] on February 9, 1880, to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]]'s reign. The college was later named in honor of [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] and was extensively expanded during the [[Soviet]] era, receiving the [[Order of Lenin]] and [[Order of the Red Banner of Labor]] awards. In 1992, the [[Russian government]] awarded the college the status of [[university]], and in 2014, D. Mendeleev University was given the ranking D by accrediting agency [[Expert RA]] and listed as one of the best higher education institutions in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].<ref>https://ru.wikinews.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD_%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3_%D0%92%D0%A3%D0%97%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B8_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD_%D0%A1%D0%9D%D0%93#%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3_%D0%92%D0%A3%D0%97%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B8_%D0%A1%D0%9D%D0%93 Expert RA rating list in Russian</ref>

D. Mendeleev University operates several [[campus]]es in Moscow and a branch in the nearby city of [[Novomoskovsk, Russia|Novomoskovsk]], [[Tula Oblast]]. The university's main campus is located at Miusskaya Square in the [[Tverskoy District]] of the [[Central Administrative Okrug]] in Moscow.

==History==
===Moscow Industrial College===
The college foundation was laid on Miusskaya Square in Moscow on May 23, 1898. The classes began on July 1 in leased premises, and the first class was out of school in 1906.

Moscow Industrial College had a strong faculty, many of whom had been professionally trained at the Imperial Moscow Technical School and Moscow State University. This fact predetermined the dynamic development of the new educational institution, which was transformed into the Moscow Chemical Technical College in 1918, and began to churn out applied engineers.

===D. Mendeleev Institute===
In 1920, Moscow Chemical Technical College was used as a basis to establish Moscow [[Dmitri Mendeleev|D. Mendeleev]] Institute of Chemical Technology (MCTI), which became the first specialised chemical technical school establishment in Russia to train professionals for the chemical and related industries, and made a hefty contribution in the industrial development and defense potential, especially during [[World War II]].

It was named after the great Russian scientist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], the discoverer of the [[Periodic law]], the establishment of which established scientific foundation for world's most further chemical research.

===D. Mendeleev University===
In 1992, the Decree by the Russian Government transformed Moscow D. Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology into D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia.
