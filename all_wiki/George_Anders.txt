==Career==
Anders has been writing for national publications since the 1980s. He started his writing career working for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and eventually became a top feature writer, specializing in in-depth profiles. A 1996 profile of electronics salesman Jeff Bloom, and his battle to regain his health after being diagnosed with AIDS, became part of a package of Journal articles awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pulitzer Prizes, 1997|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6003|work=Lack of Assurance|publisher=Dow Jones & Co.|access-date=28 December 2011}}</ref> Anders's 1998 article on Healtheon's difficulties developing medical-record software<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB907215704573844500|title=Medical Data Leaves Software Firm Frustrated by Efforts to Automate It|last=Anders|first=George|date=October 2, 1998|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=January 1, 2020}}</ref> was seen as a major reason why the company soon afterward postponed its much-awaited initial public offering. In [[The New New Thing]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The New New Thing|url=https://archive.org/details/newnewthingsili00lewi|url-access=limited|first=Michael|last=Lewis|page=[https://archive.org/details/newnewthingsili00lewi/page/183 183]|year=2000|location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton}}</ref> author [[Michael Lewis]] wrote that when Healtheon CEO Mike Long read the Journal article he "knew instantly that the roadshow was over."

After his first stint with ''The Wall Street Journal'', Anders served as West Coast bureau chief for ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' from 2000 to 2003. Anders rejoined the Journal in 2003 and left in 2008.
