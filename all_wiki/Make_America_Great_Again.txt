Marissa Melton, a [[Voice of America]] journalist, among others,<ref name="Shamus January 24, 2019"/><ref name="Abcarian 2019"/> explained how it is a loaded phrase because it "doesn't just appeal to people who hear it as [[Racism in the United States|racist]] [[Dog-whistle politics|coded language]], but also to those who have felt a loss of status as other groups have become more empowered."<ref name="Melton 2017"/> As [[Sarah Churchwell]] explains, the slogan now resonates as [[America First Committee|America First]] did in the early 1940s, with the idea "that the true version of America is the America that looks like me, the American fantasy I imagine existed before it was diluted with other races and other people."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Illing|first=Sean|date=2018-10-22|title=How "America First" ruined the "American dream"|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/10/22/17940964/america-first-trump-sarah-churchwell-american-dream|access-date=2020-10-25|website=Vox|language=en}}</ref>

Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Robin Abcarian wrote that "[w]earing a 'Make America Great Again' hat is not necessarily an overt expression of racism.
