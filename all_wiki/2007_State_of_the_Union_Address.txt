The '''2007 State of the Union Address''' was given by the 43rd [[President of the United States]], [[George W. Bush]], on Tuesday, January 23, 2007, at 9 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]], in the chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives]] to the [[110th United States Congress]]. It was Bush's sixth [[State of the Union|State of the Union Address]] and his [[s:George W. Bush's First State of the Union Address|seventh speech]] to a [[joint session of the United States Congress]]. Presiding over this joint session was the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]], [[Nancy Pelosi]], accompanied by [[Dick Cheney]], the [[Vice President of the United States]]. 

It was the first address to a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-controlled Congress since 1994. Furthermore, the speech marked the second time that a Democrat sat behind President Bush during a joint session of Congress and the first time at a State of the Union address. Traditionally, the Speaker of the House and the Vice President (the President of the Senate) are the only individuals on the [[Podium|rostrum]] with the President. However, in a joint session of Congress on September 20, 2001, following the [[September 11 attacks]] nine days earlier, [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] [[Robert Byrd]], a Democrat, took the place of Vice President Cheney, who was at an undisclosed location.<ref name="jsoc_byrd">{{cite news|first=Sandra|last=Sobieraj|title=Bush draws the line|url=http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/092101/new_0921010020.shtml |publisher=[[Associated Press]]| accessdate= 24 January 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070127010641/http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/092101/new_0921010020.shtml| archive-date= 27 January 2007| url-status= live}}</ref> As the first female Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi is also the first woman in American history to stand on the podium during a State of the Union address.

President Bush began his address by recognizing the new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi:

{{quote|And tonight I have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madam Speaker.<ref name="transcript"/>}}

==Attendance==
[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]] was not present because traditionally a member of the President's cabinet, a [[designated survivor]], does not attend in order to ensure presidential succession in the event of an emergency. Only four [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justices attended the speech: [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] and [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justices]] [[Stephen Breyer]], [[Samuel Alito]], and [[Anthony Kennedy]]. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota politician)|Tim Johnson]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Charlie Norwood]] were not present because of serious health problems, but were acknowledged with applause. Johnson recovered and returned to work by September, while Norwood died on February 13, 2007.

==Speech==

The President's speech focused equally on domestic policy and foreign policy.

===Domestic policy===
Bush placed emphasis on balancing the [[United States federal budget|federal budget]], eliminating excessive [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]], changing the [[tax code]] to replace the existing business [[tax exemption]] to workers [[health insurance]] premiums with a new personal health insurance deduction, providing [[health care]] for needy individuals, and expanding [[health savings account]]s. Bush supported "laws that are fair and borders that are secure" in regards to [[immigration]], suggesting a [[Foreign worker|temporary worker]] program, stating that, "[a]s a result, they won't have to try to sneak in".<ref name="transcript">{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html |title=President Bush Delivers State of the Union Address [Full text and video&#93; |accessdate=August 26, 2007 |last=Bush |first=George W. |authorlink=George W.

Bush said the [[United States]] has been dependent on [[North American energy independence|foreign oil]] for too long, and that this chances placing it in hostile situations. Bush asked Congress to work to reduce [[gasoline]] usage in the United States by 20 percent over the next ten years, and recommended research into [[alternative fuel]]s. He asked Congress to "double the current capacity" of the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]]. In what appears to be a change of stance, Bush made a connection between [[Energy policy of the United States|energy policy]] and [[climate change]]: "America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change."   Bush specifically named [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles as part of his "advanced energy initiative" to help end the United States "addiction to oil."

Bush asked Congress to give future [[United States federal courts|federal court]] nominees a "fair hearing", and a "prompt [[Up or down vote|up-or-down vote]] on the Senate floor."

In the realm of [[Education in the United States|education]], he asked Congress to renew the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] and consider [[school voucher]]s, although he never mentioned vouchers by name.

===Foreign policy===
A large part of Bush's speech centered on the [[Iraq]] [[Iraq War|War]]. Bush emphasized that he still stood behind it, stating that, "to win the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]], we must take the fight to the enemy."<ref name="transcript"/> He stated that the dangers of [[terrorism]] have not ended, and that it is the [[Federal government of the United States|government]]'s duty to locate terrorists and protect the American people. He stated that it was not responsible to leave Iraq yet, as it would put "ourselves in danger and our friends at risk." He emphasized that stability in Iraq is essential, and that chaos is the enemy's greatest ally. Bush asked Americans to give the Iraq War a chance, and support the troops on the field and "those on their way," a reference to the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|"surge" strategy]] involving 20,000 [[United States Army|soldiers]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] sent to [[Baghdad]] and [[Al Anbar Governorate|al-Anbar]], most of which would go to Baghdad.

Bush advocated adding to the ranks of the military. He asked Congress to authorize an increase in the Army and Marine active duty forces by 92,000 in the next five years. He spoke of developing a volunteer [[Civilian Reserve Corps]] which could help ease the burden on military personnel: "It would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time."<ref name="transcript"/> The phrase ''terror'' (whether as terror, terrorism, or terrorist) appeared 22 times in his speech, highlighting its continuing significance in his administration's foreign policy and political position.<ref name="transcript"/>

Bush advocated saving the people affected by the [[Darfur conflict|conflict]] in [[Darfur]], [[Sudan]]. He advocated continuing to fight [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], especially in [[Africa]]. Bush asked for $1.2 billion over the next five years to combat [[malaria]] in 15 African countries.

==Honored guests==

Toward the end of his speech, President Bush recognized four distinguished Americans. First, he pointed out [[Dikembe Mutombo]], a player in the [[National Basketball Association]]. He is native to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and recently built a new hospital in [[Kinshasa]], his hometown. Next, he introduced business and social entrepreneur [[Baby Einstein|Julie Aigner-Clark]], who founded the [[Baby Einstein|Baby Einstein Company]]. Then, he introduced [[Wesley Autrey]] who, three weeks prior, saved a man with [[epilepsy]] from being run down by a [[New York City]] [[New York City Subway|Subway]] train. Finally, he introduced [[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]] Tommy Rieman, an American soldier who continued to fight even though he was critically injured in Iraq.<ref>{{cite news |title=President Bush Delivers Annual State of the Union Address |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-01-24-voa4.cfm |work= voanews.com |publisher=VOA News |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=January 24, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214231204/http://voanews.com/english/2007-01-24-voa4.cfm |archivedate=February 14, 2007}}</ref>

==Critical response==

===Democratic response===
[[Jim Webb]], a [[Vietnam]] [[Vietnam War|War]] [[Vietnam veteran|veteran]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Virginia]] whose son was serving in [[Iraq]], delivered the Democratic response from [[United States Capitol|Capitol Hill]], the second year in a row for a Virginia politician. [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Tim Kaine]] delivered the Democratic response in 2006. It lasted less than nine minutes, as expected, ending at 10:24 EST.

Webb said he hoped the [[Presidency of George W. Bush#Administration and cabinet|Bush administration]] is serious about health care, education, and revitalizing the imperiled nation, as represented by [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], following [[Hurricane Katrina]] (President Bush did not mention Katrina or New Orleans in his Address). He emphasized that corporate profits are not being fairly shared, stating that [[chief executive officer]]s [[Executive compensation|make]] over 400 times that of workers, on average. Therefore, it takes an average worker over one year to make as much money as his boss makes in one day. He advocated a policy that would begin to remove United States troops from Iraq, pointing out that polls show the majority of the American people do not support the direction of the Iraq War or the president's strategy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Democratic Response by Senator Jim Webb |url=http://speaker.gov/newsroom/multimedia?id=0011 |date=January 23, 2007 |accessdate=January 24, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070216095423/http://speaker.gov/newsroom/multimedia?id=0011| archive-date= 16 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= dead}}</ref>

===Libertarian response===
[[Steve Kubby]], a [[California]] politician and declared candidate for the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], delivered an unofficial response to the address for the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. Kubby criticized the president's policies on the economy, education, and foreign policy, which he referred to as "foreign military adventurism."<ref>[http://www.kubby2008.com/node/22 The State of the Union: A Libertarian Response] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202024906/http://kubby2008.com/node/22 |date=2007-02-02 }}, Kubby2008.com</ref>

===Conservative response===
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in an article the following Thursday that [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] were upset and felt abandoned by Bush's shifts on immigration and health care, and quoted a high-ranking official with the [[American Conservative Union]] saying that "the president left a lot of conservatives shaking their heads".
