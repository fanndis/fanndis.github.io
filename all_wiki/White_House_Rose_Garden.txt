The '''White House Rose Garden''' is a [[garden]] bordering the [[Oval Office]] and the [[West Wing]] of the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. The garden is approximately 125 feet long and 60 feet wide ({{convert|125|ft|m|disp=out|abbr=off}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|disp=out|abbr=off}}). It balances the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]] on the east side of the White House Complex. It is commonly used as a stage for receptions and media events due to its proximity to the White House.

===History===
Prior to 1902, the area of the present-day Oval Office, Cabinet Room, and Rose Garden contained extensive stables housing horses and coaches. There was also a conservatory rose house in the area. During the 1902 Roosevelt renovation of the White House, First Lady [[Edith Roosevelt]] established a "proper colonial garden" in place of the conservatory.<ref name="VF"/> The White House Rose Garden was established in 1913 by [[Ellen Axson Wilson|Ellen Louise Axson Wilson]], wife of [[Woodrow Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/grounds/rose-garden.htm|title=The Rose Garden|publisher=White House Museum|language=English|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref> In 1935, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] commissioned [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]] to redesign the garden, and he installed cast iron furniture pieces.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/why-white-house-rose-garden-132300160.html|title=Melania Trump Unveils the Renovated White House Rose Garden|last=Andriotis|first=Mary Elizabeth|date=August 23, 2020|work=Yahoo|accessdate=9 September 2020}}</ref>

===Renovations performed in 1961===
In 1961, during the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy administration]], the garden was largely redesigned by [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]]<ref name="VF">{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Meryl|title=How Bunny Mellon Re-invented the White House Rose Garden|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/how-bunny-mellon-invented-the-white-house-rose-garden?|accessdate=September 23, 2017|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=September 22, 2017}}</ref> concurrently with extensive repair work to the East Garden. Mellon created a space with a more defined central lawn, bordered by flower beds that were planted in a [[French formal garden]] style whilst largely using American botanical specimens. Although individual plantings are changed frequently according to the wishes of the incumbent administration, until 2020 the garden followed the same layout first established by Mellon, where each flower bed was planted with a series of pale pink 'Katherine' crabapples and Littleleaf lindens bordered by low diamond-shaped hedges of thyme. (The 'Katherine' crabapples were replaced in 2019 with a white-flowering variety called Spring Snow, which did not do well.<ref name = Owen/>) Additionally, the outer edges to the flower bed which faced the central lawn were edged with boxwood, and each of the four corners to the garden were punctuated by [[Magnolia × soulangeana|''Magnolia'' × ''soulangeana'']]; specifically, obtaining specimens that were found growing along the banks of the [[Tidal Basin]] by Mellon.<ref name="VF"/> 

Ever since then, roses have served as the primary flowering plants in the garden, including large numbers of '[[Rosa 'Queen Elizabeth'|Queen Elizabeth]]' grandiflora roses, along with the tea roses '[[Rosa 'Pascali'|Pascali]]', '[[Rosa 'Pat Nixon'|Pat Nixon]]', and '[[Rosa 'King's Ransom'|King's Ransom]]'. A shrub rose, '[[Rosa 'Nevada'|Nevada]]', also served to add a cool note of white coloration to the landscaping. Seasonal flowers are further interspersed to add nearly year-round color and variety to the garden. Some of the Spring blooming bulbs planted in the Rose Garden include jonquil, daffodil, fritillaria, grape hyacinth, tulips, chionodoxa and squill. Summer blooming annuals are changed on a near yearly basis. In the fall, chrysanthemum and flowering kale bring color leading all the way up until the early winter days. In a tradition, every summer sees garden gnomes placed throughout the Rose Garden on July 1st - the number representing the number of living presidents at that time.{{fact|date=October 2020}}

=== Renovations performed in 2020 ===
As part of an August 2020 renovation project by Oehme, van Sweden and Perry Guillot, First Lady [[Melania Trump]] ordered the ornamental trees, originally planted by Mellon and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], to be removed and relocated elsewhere on the White House grounds, as the newer trees were failing to thrive. <ref name= Hosken/> In the flower beds, white and pale pink rose bushes are intermixed with seasonal bulbs and annuals. A new limestone walk, {{convert|36|in|cm}} wide to comply with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]], was laid around the borders of the garden.<ref name = Owen/> There were some public complaints that she had too drastically changed the historic White House garden; others have praised the Rose Garden's new appearance, calling it elegant, appropriate, and “clean and classy”, while Guillot stated of the redesign: “The project has been the honor of my career.”

White House interior designer and Grounds Committee member Thammanoune Kannalikham clarified the decision: “It was a collective decision by the entire team to respond to the changed environment of the garden (nearly 60 years). It allows the roses to thrive (having increased in quantity from 19 to over 200), while bringing in the greater narrative of the colonnade into the design of the garden. Whereas previously these were two defined spaces. Today they are one.”.<ref name = Owen>{{cite news |last=Owen |first=M. |url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/the-full-story-behind-the-controversial-rose-garden-redesign |title=The Full Story Behind the Controversial Rose Garden Redesign |work=Architectural Digest |date=August 27, 2020 }}</ref>

Beginning with the establishment of the garden in the early twentieth century, the Rose Garden has been used for events. President Wilson met there with the press for informal questions. President [[Herbert Hoover]] began a tradition of welcoming and being photographed with prominent citizens there. [[Calvin Coolidge]] used the garden for making public announcements about policy and staffing decisions. President [[John F. Kennedy]] welcomed [[Project Mercury]] astronauts in the garden. Many presidential [[news conference]]s take place in the garden, as well as occasional White House dinners and ceremonies. The [[List of weddings at the White House|marriage]] of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s daughter [[Tricia Nixon Cox|Tricia]] to [[Edward F. Cox|<span lang="fr" dir="ltr">Edward</span> F. Cox]] took place in the Rose Garden in 1971. In recent years, joint news conferences with the president and a visiting head of state have been held in the Rose Garden. Presidents frequently host American Olympic and major league athletes in the Rose Garden after winning in their respective sport. [[George W. Bush]] welcomed the [[Stanley Cup]] champion [[Carolina Hurricanes]] to the Rose Garden after their victory in 2006. In August 2020, First Lady [[Melania Trump]] gave a speech for the second night of the [[2020 Republican National Convention]] in the Rose Garden before an audience of 70 people.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/26/politics/rose-garden-attendees-coronavirus-tests-melania-trump/index.html|title=Melania Trump Rose Garden speech attendees not all required to get coronavirus tests|date=August 26, 2020|work=CNN|accessdate=9 September 2020}}</ref> Although the Rose Garden is used frequently to greet distinguished visitors and for special ceremonies and public statements, the contemplative setting is often a very personal and private place for the president.

On September 26, 2020, President Donald Trump announced his [[Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nomination]] of [[Amy Coney Barrett]] in a ceremony in the Rose Garden before an audience of top Washington officials, other dignitaries, and family members.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McGrane |first1=Victoria |title=Supreme Court pick faces uncertainty as COVID-19 cases from Rose Garden event mount |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/10/02/metro/will-covid-19-outbreak-derail-trumps-supreme-court-pick/ |accessdate=October 2, 2020 |work=The Boston Globe |date=October 2, 2020}}</ref> Following the event, [[White House COVID-19 outbreak|several attendees tested positive]] for [[coronavirus disease 2019]], including Trump himself.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yang |first1=Allie |title=7 attendees of SCOTUS nomination at Rose Garden test positive for COVID-19 |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/attendees-scotus-nomination-rose-garden-test-positive-covid/story?id=73391378 |accessdate=October 2, 2020 |work=ABC News |date=October 2, 2020}}</ref>

===Rose Garden strategy===
The phrase "Rose Garden strategy" (such as a re-election strategy) refers to staying inside or on the grounds of the White House as opposed to traveling throughout the country.<ref>[http://politicaldictionary.com/words/rose-garden-campaign/ Rose Garden campaign] from politicaldictionary.com</ref> For example, [[Jimmy Carter]]'s initial efforts to end the [[Iran hostage crisis]] (1979–1981) were a Rose Garden strategy because he mostly held discussions with his close advisers in the White House. On July 25, 1994 a declaration of peace between Israel and Jordan was signed in the Rose Garden.
