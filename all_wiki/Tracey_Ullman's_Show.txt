On 26 May 2017, the BBC announced that it had ordered a new topical half hour Tracey Ullman special, ''[[Tracey Breaks the News (pilot)|Tracey Breaks the News]]'' for BBC One.

On 30 August, HBO announced that ''Tracey Ullman's Show'' would return for a third series starting 28 September 2018. The third series utilises material produced for Ullman's follow-up show ''Tracey Breaks the News''.<ref name="medium.com">{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/hbo-cinemax-pr/tracey-ullmans-show-returns-for-third-season-sept-28-on-hbo-64a89163f2a6|title=Emmy®-Nominated Sketch Comedy Series Tracey Ullman's Show Returns for Third Season Sept. 28 on HBO|date=30 August 2018|website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|accessdate=30 August 2018}}</ref> Furthermore, the aforementioned show has been recut and sold internationally under the ''Tracey Ullman's Show'' banner.

==Premise==
Each episode offers a glimpse of British life, from dusk till dawn, for many of its inhabitants (the everyday and the very famous).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/632156/Actress-Tracey-Ullmans-Show-sketch-BBC|title=Tracey Ullman returns to Brit TV with a new BBC sketch show|work=Daily Express|publisher=Express.co.uk|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref> Locals, tourists, even those smuggling themselves into the country are included. A typical episode consists of sketches ranging from one to three minutes with one sketch's storyline acting as the spine of the episode. Each show features an original song penned by Ullman and composer [[Richard Thomas (musician)|Richard Thomas]] (''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_tracey_ullman_show/episodes/1/3/|title=12 facts about Tracey Ullman's Show|work=[[Western Morning News]]|publisher=Westernmorningnews.co.uk|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref>

For series 3, the show shifted from its "a day in the life" premise set in Great Britain to the world stage in a post-[[Brexit]] world along with a more topical format. Impersonations of world leaders are now the show's main focus.

==Development==
In late 2014, whilst promoting the film ''[[Into the Woods (film)|Into the Woods]]'', Tracey Ullman revealed plans to write something new for television in the following year. "Every five years it comes to me to sort of do what I do again and I throw a load of stuff at the wall, and some of it works and some of it obviously doesn't, but that's the nature of television. I love TV."<ref name=metro>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.us/entertainment/tracey-ullman-takes-on-the-current-state-of-the-entertainment-industry/zsJnlx---lGSxB8GQazD7U/|title=Tracey Ullman takes on the current state of the entertainment industry|work=Metro|publisher=Metro.us|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref> Her American [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series, ''[[Tracey Ullman's State of the Union]]'' ran for three seasons, concluding in 2010. It was a departure and a return of sorts. Instead of playing just original characters (a staple of Ullman's comedy) the show saw her imitating real people (celebrities, politicians, etc.) something she hadn't done since her early days at the BBC with ''[[Three of a Kind (1981 TV series)|Three of a Kind]]'', the show that made her a household name in Great Britain.

In 2014, Ullman was invited [[BBC One]] controller [[Charlotte Moore (TV executive)|Charlotte Moore]] and head of comedy production Myfanwy Moore to discuss the possibility of working on a new project together for the broadcaster.<ref name=televisual>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisual.com/blog-detail/Tracey-Ullman-one-of-a-kind_bid-847.html|title=Tracey Ullman: one of a kind|work=Televisual|publisher=Televisual.com|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref> The trio hit it off and came up with a concept: a multi-camera show in which Ullman plays "a multitude of diverse and distinct characters living in, or visiting, the busy global hub that is the UK."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/comedy-commissions?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_press_office&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=corporate|title=BBC celebrates its commitment to comedy with raft of new commissions|publisher=BBC|date=4 March 2015|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

Whilst visiting, Ullman noted the vast number of women now heading the corporation, a stark contrast to her early days at the BBC. "When I was there years and years ago, it was five men in bowties who talked about the war and [[The Goon Show|The Goons]]...it was so male dominated."<ref name=televisual/> However, some things remained the same: "The important things haven't changed, though. The BBC still provides an environment that allows you the freedom to create the best shows possible."<ref name=bbc/>

Ullman revealed her long-held desire to return to British television in 2015. "I have lived in America for a really long time, but I was never away from England. I was always there, I just didn't work there. I wasn't offered anything there really. So when the BBC called me last year, I was really thrilled. I mean, I wanted to do something England. The last thing I'd done was with [[Michael Palin]]. We did [''[[Tracey Ullman: A Class Act]]''] in 1992, I think. We did a show about the class system in Britain and it was just wonderful fun. And from that HBO picked that up and I did [''[[Tracey Takes On...|Tracey Takes On]]'']. So it started from a British show."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/screenings/c21tv/the-tracey-ullman-show/8330|title=The Tracey Ullman show|publisher=C21media.net|date=12 September 2016|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>

After hitting it big in the United States, her star began to wane in Britain. Ullman, who likes to study people for creating characters, says that she's enjoyed the anonymity when living in London.  "I can observe people on the tube without them recognising me."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/10/tracey-ullman-my-face-is-good-for-impersonations|title=Tracey Ullman: 'My face is good for impersonations'|publisher=The Guardian|date=10 January 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref>

On 4 March 2015, a formal announcement was made, confirming the project, with Ullman saying that it was a 'privilege to be doing this,' and "I still feel as inspired to inhabit people as I did when I was six, standing on the windowsill in my mother's bedroom, putting on a show." Shane Allen, controller of comedy commissioning added: "It's about time the Americans gave her back. Tracey has been the missing gem in the British comedy crown for too long. Talent doesn't come much bigger and the BBC audience is in for a huge treat."<ref name=bbc/>

A fan of [[Armando Iannucci]], Ullman assembled a writing team which includes ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]'' scribes, Georgia Pritchett, [[Kevin Cecil]] and [[Andy Riley]], with ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'''s [[Jeremy Dyson]] acting as both series writer and script supervisor.<ref name=televisual/>

The show marks the first time in a long time that Ullman has made a series without her producing partner and husband of thirty years, [[Allan McKeown]], who died in 2013. "Emotionally it was great to get out after having worked with my husband for 30 years." The show is, however, produced by the BBC along with McKeown's production company, Allan McKeown Presents (now run by Ullman<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/tracey-ullman-hbo-sketch-comedy-series-bbc-1201902441/|title=Tracey Ullman Sketches Out Her Next Chapter With New HBO/BBC Series|publisher=Variety|date=27 October 2016|accessdate=29 October 2016}}</ref>) "So he is still presenting me..."<ref name=televisual/>

The show's first two series features a [[laugh track]], something Ullman was hesitant about using. "That's a very BBC thing to do. I hate things like that on a show. But when we played it, it kind of worked. It makes it sound like you're connecting with people. Comedy has gotten a bit cold lately, and neurotic and depressed. This is a nice BBC One family show. It's not too arch or bleak." All laughter is genuine and was captured via live screenings before a studio audience at [[Broadcasting House|BBC Radio Theatre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2016/10/tracey-ullman-show-hbo-bbc-judi-dench-maggie-smith-angela-merkel-1201741293/|title=Tracey Ullman Says Her New HBO Sketch Series is the Antidote to TV's Rash of Bleak Comedies|publisher=Indiewire|date=28 October 2016|accessdate=29 October 2016}}</ref>

==Background==
After her breakthrough award-winning performance at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in the improvised play ''Four in a Million'', the BBC offered Ullman her own show.<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |date= |title=Tracey's Papers |url=http://tracey-archives.tumblr.com/post/113163172393/tracey-ullman-the-face-no37 |journal=The Face |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages=pg.69}}</ref> She was quickly cast in ''[[A Kick Up the Eighties]]'' and ''[[Three of a Kind (1981 TV Series)|Three of a Kind]]''. becoming the first British woman to be offered her own sketch comedy show.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tracey Ullman returns to BBC with first television series in 30 years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/08/tracey-ullman-returns-to-bbc-with-first-television-series-in-30-years|work=The Guardian|publisher=Theguardian.com|accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref> Her performance earned her a [[BAFTA]] award in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|title=BAFTA Awards|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1984/television/light-entertainment-performance|work=BAFTA|publisher=BAFTA.org|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> She became a household name with the British media affectionately dubbing her 'Our Trace.'<ref>{{cite web|title=QUEEN OF THE SKITCOM : Tracey Ullman Has Lost Her Prized Anonymity, but Her Ratings Have Fox Grinning

In 1985, she teamed with comedians [[Dawn French]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]] in the sitcom ''[[Girls on Top (UK TV series)|Girls on Top]]''. Ullman's husband, Allan McKeown, a successful television producer, convinced her to take a gamble on a career in America.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mills |first=Nancy |date=19 November 2000 |title=A Demented Pixie Grows Up |url= |journal=You Magazine |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages=pg.29–32}}</ref> After turning down due to creative differences, she teamed with famed television and film producer [[James L.

Ullman received critical acclaim and was rewarded with a slew of accolades. The show would go on to win the Fox network's first Emmy award.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tracey Ullman – About This Person – Movies & TV – NYTimes.com|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/72400/Tracey-Ullman|work=The New York Times|publisher=NYTimes.com|accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Ullman to leave Fox network|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19900516&id=IgYqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Uc4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6698,528720&hl=en |newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal |location=Spartanburg, South Carolina |date=16 May 1990 |access-date=24 November 2015}}</ref> ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', while American-based, included Ullman's British sensibility with a variety of British characters created for her to play alongside American.

Though the British media continued to follow and exploit her success in the United States throughout the latter part of the 1980s, Ullman's visibility on the small screen in the UK waned until almost 1990 when the BBC finally picked up ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' which was winding down its four-year run on Fox. The broadcaster made significant edits to the show, eliminating [[The Simpsons shorts]] entirely. Ullman had even attempted to persuade the broadcaster to buy ''[[The Simpsons]]'' when the characters were spun-off into their own primetime sitcom.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tracey Ullman sues Fox|url=http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/107345/Who-s-that-girl|work=Daily Express|publisher=Express.co.uk|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>

In 1992, Ullman returned to British television with the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television comedy special, ''Tracey Ullman: A Class Act''.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC – Comedy – Guide – Tracey Ullman: A Class Act |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/traceyullmanacla_66603500.shtml |work=BBC |publisher=BBC.co.uk |accessdate=14 September 2015 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404051645/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/traceyullmanacla_66603500.shtml |archivedate=4 April 2005 }}</ref> She was joined by [[Monty Python]] alum, Michael Palin. ''A Class Act'' took a satirical jab at the [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|British class system]]. The special proved to be a critical success, garnering the attention of American cable television network, [[HBO]]. The network approached Ullman with the idea of doing a special for them, with the caveat that she take on a more American subject. ''[[Tracey Ullman Takes On New York]]'' was another critical and award-winning success, sparking HBO to offer Ullman her own series. ''Tracey Takes On...'' ran for four seasons (1996–1999), raking up numerous accolades and critical praise.<ref>{{harvnb|Ullman|1998|p=xv}}</ref> It eventually aired on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the UK in 1998.

In the 2000s, Ullman's focus shifted to film, whilst continuing to produce specials for HBO. She launched a [[Purple Skirt|fashion internet company]] and [[Tracey Ullman's Visible Panty Lines|chat show ''Tracey Ullman's Visible Panty Lines'']] for [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen network]] in 2001, and in 2008, returned with a new sketch comedy series for Showtime, ''Tracey Ullman's State of the Union''. ''State of the Union'' focused primarily on American subjects, however, it also featured Ullman impersonating English celebrities such as Dames [[Helen Mirren]] and [[Judi Dench]], [[JK Rowling]], and [[David Beckham]]. Despite its potential crossover appeal, Ullman was unable to secure the rights to a television broadcaster in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brit comedienne Tracey Ullman can't crack the UK|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/107675/Brit-comedienne-Tracey-Ullman-can-t-crack-the-UK|work=Daily Express|publisher=Express.co.uk|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>

In 2009, Ullman was awarded her second BAFTA, this time the Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7989633.stm|title='Lifetime Bafta award' for Ullman | work=BBC News | date=8 April 2009}}</ref>

==Opening title sequence==
The opening title sequence which features both a young Tracey (played by Ruby MacDonald<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/newmarket-youngster-bags-spot-opening-sequence/story-28543609-detail/story.html|title=Newmarket youngster bags spot in opening sequence of Tracey Ullman television show|publisher=Cambridge News|date=16 January 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>) performing on a bedroom windowsill along with an adult Tracey is meant as a tribute to Ullman's mother who died in a fire at her retirement flat in early 2015 while the series was in its writing phase. When Ullman was six, her father died of a heart attack and her mother was left to raise her and her sister alone with very little money. In the aftermath of their father's death, Ullman would put on shows in her mother's bedroom on her windowsill in an effort to cheer the family up. "That little scene in the bedroom dancing around that was where everything started for me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-11/how-us-comedy-star-tracey-ullman-came-home-to-the-bbc|title=How US comedy star Tracey Ullman came home to the BBC|publisher=Radio Times|date=11 January 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>

==Recurring characters and origins==
The following characters have made more than one on-screen appearance. A typical episode of ''Tracey Ullman's Show'' consists of both original characters and celebrity impersonations. Celebrity impersonations are recurring whereas original characters are usually one-offs (created for the sole purpose of a single sketch). However, a selection of original characters do make recurring appearances. They are detailed below:

==Celebrity impersonations and reaction==
{{Rquote|right|I wanted to do a series of national treasures, which I think we have in England.|Tracey Ullman<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/tracey-ullman-wear-fatsuit-play-7112472|title=Tracey Ullman: I had to wear fatsuit to play Judi Dench and being Dame Maggie Smith was hard|publisher=Mirror Online|date=4 January 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>}}

The show features Ullman playing an array of real-life people aside from a hearty helping of original characters. Impersonations include [[Theresa May]], [[Judi Dench]], [[Nicola Sturgeon]], [[Maggie Smith]], and members of the [[British Royal Family]], [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla Parker-Bowles]] and [[Carole Middleton]]. Ullman received considerable international attention for her portrayal of [[German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]].<ref>[http://meedia.de/2016/01/21/true-total-hottie-frau-die-bislang-beste-merkel-parodie-kommt-von-der-bbc/ „True total hottie Frau“: Die bislang beste Merkel-Parodie kommt von der BBC], Buzzer, 21.01.2016.</ref> On 23 June 2017, BBC One's ''[[The One Show]]'' reached out to Angela Merkel's office for a statement regarding Ullman's impersonation of her:

{{quote| "Thank you very much for your email requesting a statement from Chancellor Merkel for the hilarious Tracey Ullman. I am very sorry, but due to the Chancellor's extremely busy schedule, she's in Brussels right now, and the G20 summit is just around the corner, she will not be able to send the requested statement."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08vd15v/the-one-show-23062017|title=The One Show - 23/06/2017|publisher=[[BBC iPlayer]]|date=23 June 2017|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> 
 |sign= Office of German Chancellor Angela Merkel
 }}

Ullman contends that her impersonations are played with great admiration and affection. "I hope they take it in the right spirit!" Judi Dench reacted positively to Ullman portraying as getting away with unethical public behavior because she is a national treasure. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on [[Facebook]] with the caption, "brilliant, just brilliant."<ref name=dailyexpress>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/635007/Comedian-Tracey-Ullman-Angela-Merkel-the-Duchess-of-Conrwall-Maggie-Smith|title='Such a thrill':Comedian Tracey Ullman returns with a new show on BBC|publisher=Daily Express|date=17 January 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref> Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, for a second or two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch-perfect vocals."<ref name=thenational>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-life/television/tracey-ullman-gets-set-to-begin-her-imitation-game|title=Tracey Ullman gets set to begin her imitation game|publisher=The National|date=5 March 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref> In April 2017, while speaking to [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Front Row (radio programme)|Front Row]]'', Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant. "But I get into trouble now if I go into a shop with a bag over my arm [...] A man came up to me in [[Marks & Spencer|M&S]] the other day and said to me, 'I've got my eye on you'."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39733607|title=Dame Judi: I love Tracey Ullman's 'evil Judi' sketches|publisher=BBC News|date=27 April 2017|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref> Speaking to the ''Radio Times'', Dench further stated, "It's so anarchic, I love it. It's much more like me than anything else," although she detests being referred to as a "national treasure."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/style/dame-judi-dench.html|title=Queen! Bow Down to Tattoo-Flashing Octogenarian Dame Dench|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 September 2017|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>

One person Ullman doesn't expect to have the same reaction as Dench is the Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla Parker-Bowles. "For Camilla, I don't think I'm going to get any Facebook approval!"<ref name=dailyexpress/> In Series One, she plays both grandmothers to the youngest heir to the [[Succession to the British throne|British royal throne]], Camilla Parker-Bowles and [[Carole Middleton]]. "It occurred to me that [[Prince George of Cambridge|Prince George]] must get taken to different grandmothers, you know? We just imagined [an earthy] Camilla: Do you want to drown a kitten in a barrel or put your hand up a horse's uterus?"<ref name=tvinsider/>

Maggie Smith is portrayed as an actress who prefers to work from home (or not work at all). Smith's portrayal was inspired by an incident that reportedly took place on the set of ''[[Downton Abbey]]''. Ullman: "[...] I heard a rumour that one day she was miserable on the show and they said, 'Maggie, what can we do? What can we do to make you more comfortable?' And she went, [in Smith's voice] 'Write me a death scene.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/28/499796182/british-comedian-tracey-ullman-brings-celebrity-impersonations-to-hbo|title=From Maggie Smith To Angela Merkel, Comic Tracey Ullman Leaves An Impression|publisher=NPR|date=28 October 2016|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref>

In the show's second series, Ullman portrays current [[Scottish First Minister]] [[Nicola Sturgeon]] as megalomaniac who is after more than just Scottish Independence. [[Westminster]]'s youngest MP, [[Mhairi Black]] assists Sturgeon in the series opener by torturing a captive JK Rowling. On Sturgeon, Ullman says: "I like her a lot and respect her steeliness. [...] I would love her to meet [Donald Trump] and play golf with him and whup his ass. [My co-writer] Jeremy Dyson imagined her as a Bond villain — we filmed for two days in [[Chislehurst Caves]], it was freezing and I was wearing pink, four-inch high heels. But I felt very powerful, and the crew were very much under my command. I think she will like it — she seems to have a good sense of humour."<ref name=impressions>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-02-03/tracey-ullmans-guide-to-her-favourite-celebrity-impressions|title=Tracey Ullman's guide to her favourite celebrity impressions|publisher=Radio Times|date=3 February 2017|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref> Upon seeing her portrayal, Mhairi Black (impersonated by actress Olivia Morgan) was quoted as saying "It was all right. It was quite a bizarre scenario. But I thought it was quite clever and quite witty."<ref>{{cite news |last=Speirs|first=Kenneth|date=7 February 2017|title=The joke's on Mhairi – and she loved it|newspaper=[[Paisley Daily Express]]}} Available at [http://www.allabouttracey.com/2017/02/mhairi-black-takes-her-tracey-ullmans.html allabouttracey.com]</ref> In an interview for the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' newspaper during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about Ullman's impersonation of her. "I've not seen all of them but I had to watch some because I've heard so much about it. I thought it was really funny." When asked if she should her in all the "Brexit drama", Sturgeon responded: "I definitely think she should! She's got the outfit and everything!"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.metro.news/content/20170602.am/htmlpages/620277.html|title=Sharon's quickfire corner|publisher=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=2 June 2017|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref>

Beginning with the show's 2016 Christmas special, "The Best of Tracey Ullman's Show", Ullman plays a workaholic [[Clare Balding]]. "I like Clare. She was captain of the volleyball team at school. I watched her present the Olympics and she's incredible. She's really passionate when talking about horses, and she talks really fast... 'Beautiful filly, beautiful filly...' She never stops, you never feel uncomfortable with her, she knows how to talk to everybody. And I got this feeling that she was like, 'Oh, don't worry, I'll work the Christmas holidays, I can do that show, I'll work Boxing Day as well, nothing like the holidays.' She never stops."<ref name=impressions/>

In series 2, Ullman portrays a very bitter [[Germaine Greer]]. Greer, who in recent years has come under fire for her controversial [[transgender]] views,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/germaine-greer-defends-her-transgender-views-and-starts-another/|title=Germaine Greer defends her transgender views and starts another row|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=12 April 2016|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref> complains about being silenced by the media to anyone who will listen in the series. "I think Germaine Greer has become intellectually homeless, so I play her at a bus stop looking homeless. [In my version] she was this great sex symbol and she likes to talk about s****ing [[Martin Amis]] in the 60s, but what's she done recently? She's constantly blaming old age: 'You try being old! It's the biggest sin of all.'"<ref name=impressions/>

[[Rupert Murdoch]]'s daughter [[Elisabeth Murdoch (businesswoman)|Elisabeth Murdoch]] came up to Ullman and told her that the family approved and liked what she was doing with the show's sketches about their family. "He's always had a good sense of humour, Rupert." said Ullman to [[WNYC]]'s [[Leonard Lopate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/tracey-ullman/|title=The Many Tracey Ullmans|publisher=[[WNYC]]|date=12 October 2017|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref>

==''Tracey Breaks the News''==
{{Main|Tracey Breaks the News (pilot)}}

On 26 May 2017, the BBC announced that it had ordered a new topical half hour Tracey Ullman special, ''[[Tracey Breaks the News]]'' for BBC One. The show is inspired by and due to air shortly after the [[2017 United Kingdom general election]]. Impersonations expected are Angela Merkel, Nicola Sturgeon, as well as Ullman's first take on Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] and [[Melania Trump]]. Like ''Tracey Ullman's Show'', it will feature a mix of famous and everyday people all reacting to the aftermath of the general election along with the anniversary of the [[Brexit]] vote. It will include the reaction of not only the UK, but Europeans and Russians. "I'm excited the BBC has asked me to make a show at this time. We've decided to shake it up with a more topical format because things move so fast these days it's like every 10 minutes I'm voting for something. There's never been a better time to be imitating world famous political women, and I admire and thank them all: Angela Merkel, Nicola Sturgeon, and my home girl newbie Theresa May. I can't wait to get stuck in – thanks to the BBC and my brilliant team. It really is a privilege."<ref name=satireshows/><ref name=traceybreaks/>
