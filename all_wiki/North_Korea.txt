'''North Korea''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: {{linktext|조선}}, [[McCune–Reischauer|MR]]: ''Chosŏn''; literally {{linktext|북조선}}, [[McCune–Reischauer|MR]]: ''Pukchosŏn'', or {{linktext|북한}}/{{linktext|北韓}}, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Bukhan'' in South Korean usage), officially the '''Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' ('''DPRK''' or '''DPR Korea'''; Korean: {{linktext|조선민주주의인민공화국}}, ''Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk''), is a country in [[East Asia]] constituting the northern part of the [[Korea|Korean Peninsula]]. The country is bordered to the north [[China–North Korea border|by China]] and [[North Korea–Russia border|by Russia]] along the [[Amnok]] (known as the Yalu in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) and [[Tumen River|Tumen]] rivers, and to the south by [[South Korea]], with the heavily fortified [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) separating the two. North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. [[Pyongyang]] is the country's capital and largest city.

In 1910, [[Korean Empire|Korea]] was [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexed]] by [[Imperial Japan]]. At the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] at the [[End of World War II in Asia|end of World War II]] in 1945, Korea was [[Division of Korea|divided into two zones]], with the [[Soviet Civil Administration|north occupied by the Soviet Union]] and the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|south occupied by the United States]]. Negotiations on [[Korean reunification|reunification]] failed, and in 1948, separate governments were formed: the socialist Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the capitalist [[First Republic of Korea|Republic of Korea]] in the south. [[Operation Pokpoong|An invasion]] initiated by North Korea led to the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953). The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] brought about a ceasefire, but no peace treaty was signed.

According to article 1 of the [[constitution of North Korea]], the DPRK is an "independent [[Socialist state|socialist State]]".<ref group="n" name="ccc"/><ref name=naenara>[http://www.naenara.com.kp/index.php/Main/index/en/politics?arg_val=constitution DPRK Socialist Constitution]</ref> North Korea [[Elections in North Korea|holds elections]], though they have been described by independent observers as [[sham election]]s.

Pyongyang's nuclear [[brinkmanship]], though potentially dangerous, is driven by fear rather than by militaristic ambition. The rotten Stalinist dictatorship faces the prospect of an implosion. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, which deprived North Korea of vital economic support, the nation has consistently attempted to secure from the US a non-aggression pact, recognition of its sovereignty, and economic assistance. The US's equally consistent refusal to enter into direct negotiations with North Korea, effectively ruling out a peace treaty to formally close the 1950–53 Korean War, has encouraged the regime to resort to nuclear blackmail. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203224805/http://socialistworld.net/eng/2003/02/08korea.html |archive-date=3 December 2007 }}</ref><ref name="nysuccess">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/02/international/asia/02CND-KORE.html?ex=1380513600&en=a29d7f1e49aabee0&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND |title=North Korea Says It Is Using Plutonium to Make A-Bombs |accessdate=31 October 2007 |last=Brooke |first=James |author-link=James Brooke (journalist) |date=2 October 2003 |work=The New York Times |quote=North Korea, run by a Stalinist dictatorship for almost six decades, is largely closed to foreign reporters and it is impossible to independently check today's claims. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206032652/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/02/international/asia/02CND-KORE.html?ex=1380513600&en=a29d7f1e49aabee0&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND |archive-date=6 December 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11465278 |title=A portrait of North Korea's new rich |accessdate=18 June 2009 |date=29 May 2008 |work=[[The Economist]] |quote=EVERY developing country worth its salt has a bustling middle class that is transforming the country and thrilling the markets.

After the division of the country into North and South Korea, the two sides used different terms to refer to Korea: ''Chosun'' or ''Joseon'' (조선) in North Korea, and ''Hanguk'' (한국) in South Korea. In 1948, North Korea adopted ''Democratic People's Republic of Korea'' ({{Lang-ko|조선민주주의인민공화국}}, ''Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk''; {{Audio|Ko-조선민주주의인민공화국.oga|listen|help=no}}) as its new legal name. In the wider world, because the government controls the northern part of the [[Korean Peninsula]], it is commonly called North Korea to distinguish it from South Korea, which is officially called the ''Republic of Korea'' in English. Both governments consider themselves to be the legitimate government of the whole of [[Korea]].<ref>{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | url = https://archive.org/details/makingmodernkore00buzo | url-access = limited | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/makingmodernkore00buzo/page/n82 72]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| author-link = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

===Founding===
[[File:Kim Il-sung in 1950.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Kim Il-sung]], the founder of North Korea]]
After the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Korea was [[Korea under Japanese rule|occupied by Japan]] from 1910 to 1945. Korean resistance groups known as [[Dongnipgun]] (Liberation Army) operated along the Sino-Korean border, fighting guerrilla warfare against Japanese forces. Some of them took part in allied action in China and parts of [[South East Asia]]. One of the guerrilla leaders was the communist [[Kim Il-sung]], who later became the first leader of North Korea.

After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] at the [[End of World War II in Asia|end of World War II]] in 1945, [[Division of Korea|the Korean Peninsula was divided]] into two zones along the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], with the northern half of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet Union and the southern half [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|by the United States]]. Negotiations on [[Korean reunification|reunification]] failed. Soviet general [[Terentii Shtykov]] recommended the establishment of the [[Soviet Civil Authority]] in October 1945, and supported [[Kim Il-sung]] as chairman of the [[Provisional People's Committee for North Korea]], established in February 1946. In September 1946, South Korean citizens rose up against the Allied Military Government. In April 1948, an [[Jeju Uprising|uprising of the Jeju islanders]] was violently crushed. The South declared its statehood in May 1948 and two months later the ardent anti-communist [[Syngman Rhee]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Administrative Population and Divisions Figures (#26) |work=DPRK: The Land of the Morning Calm |publisher=Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use |date=April 2003 |url=http://www.pcgn.org.uk/North%20Korea-%20Land%20of%20the%20Morning%20Calm-%202003.pdf |accessdate=10 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925042059/http://www.pcgn.org.uk/North%20Korea-%20Land%20of%20the%20Morning%20Calm-%202003.pdf |archive-date=25 September 2006}}</ref> became its ruler. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established in the North on 9 September 1948. Shtykov served as the first Soviet ambassador, while Kim Il-sung became premier.

Soviet forces withdrew from the North in 1948, and most American forces withdrew from the South in 1949. Ambassador Shtykov suspected Rhee was planning to invade the North and was sympathetic to Kim's goal of Korean unification under socialism. The two successfully lobbied [[Joseph Stalin]] to support a quick war against the South, which culminated in the outbreak of the Korean War.<ref name=LankovArticle>{{cite news|last=Lankov |first=Andrei |date=25 January 2012 |title=Terenti Shtykov: the other ruler of nascent N.

The [[military of North Korea]] invaded the [[South Korea|South]] on 25 June 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country. A [[United Nations Command|United Nations force]], led by the United States, intervened to defend the South, and rapidly advanced into North Korea. As they neared the border with China, [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese forces]] intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war again. Fighting ended on 27 July 1953, with [[Korean Armistice Agreement|an armistice]] that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea, but no peace treaty was signed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,528320,00.html|title=U.S.: N.

Estimates of communist troops killed are about one-half million. The total number of Korean civilians who died in the fighting, which left almost every major city in North and South Korea in ruins, has been estimated at between 2 and 3 million. This adds up to almost 1 million military deaths and a possible 2.5 million civilians who were killed or died as a result of this extremely destructive conflict.

===Post-war developments===
[[File:Dprk_pyongyang_tchholima_05.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Chollima Statue|Statue]] of [[Chollima Movement]] in Pyongyang]]
The relative peace between the South and the North following the armistice was interrupted by border skirmishes, celebrity abductions, and assassination attempts. The North failed in several assassination attempts on South Korean leaders, such as [[Blue House Raid|in 1968]], 1974, and the [[Rangoon bombing]] in 1983; tunnels were found under the DMZ and tensions flared over the [[axe murder incident]] at [[Panmunjom]] in 1976.<ref>Kirkbride, Wayne (1984).

Recovery from the war was quick—by 1957 industrial production reached 1949 levels. In 1959, relations with Japan had improved somewhat, and North Korea began allowing the repatriation of Japanese citizens in the country. The same year, North Korea revalued the [[North Korean won]], which held greater value than its South Korean counterpart. Until the 1960s, economic growth was higher than in South Korea, and North Korean GDP per capita was equal to that of its southern neighbor as late as 1976.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|pp=XXXII, 46}} However, by the 1980s, the economy had begun to stagnate; it started its long decline in 1987 and almost completely collapsed after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, when all Soviet aid was suddenly halted.{{Sfn|French|2007|pp=97–99}}

North Korea promised to halt its development of nuclear weapons under the [[Agreed Framework]], negotiated with U.S. president [[Bill Clinton]] and signed in 1994. Building on [[Nordpolitik]], South Korea began to engage with the North as part of its [[Sunshine Policy]].<ref>Kwak, Tae-Hwan; Joo, Seung-Ho (2003). ''The Korean peace process and the four powers''.

Kim Jong-il instituted a policy called ''[[Songun]]'', or "military first".

Flooding in the mid-1990s exacerbated the economic crisis, severely damaging crops and infrastructure and led to [[North Korean famine|widespread famine]] which the government proved incapable of curtailing, resulting in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 people.

===Political ideology===
{{Further|Juche}}

The ''[[Juche]]'' ideology is the cornerstone of party works and government operations. It is viewed by the official North Korean line as an embodiment of Kim Il-sung's wisdom, an expression of his leadership, and an idea which provides "a complete answer to any question that arises in the struggle for national liberation".{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=203}} ''Juche'' was pronounced in December 1955 in a speech called ''[[On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work]]'' in order to emphasize a Korea-centered revolution.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=203}} Its core tenets are [[economic self-sufficiency]], military self-reliance and an independent foreign policy. The roots of ''Juche'' were made up of a complex mixture of factors, including the cult of personality centered on Kim Il-sung, the conflict with pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese dissenters, and Korea's centuries-long struggle for independence.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=204}} ''Juche'' was introduced into [[Constitution of North Korea|the constitution]] in 1972.<ref>[[Wikisource:Constitution of North Korea (1972)]]</ref>{{sfn|Martin|2004|p=111|ps=: "Although it was in that 1955 speech that Kim Il-sung gave full voice to his arguments for ''juche'', he had been talking along similar lines as early as 1948."}}

''Juche'' was initially promoted as a "creative application" of [[Marxism–Leninism]], but in the mid-1970s, it was described by state propaganda as "the only scientific thought... and most effective revolutionary theoretical structure that leads to the future of communist society". ''Juche'' eventually replaced Marxism–Leninism entirely by the 1980s,{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=206}} and in 1992 references to the latter were omitted from the constitution.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=186}} The 2009 constitution dropped references to communism and elevated the ''[[Songun]]'' military-first policy while explicitly confirming the position of Kim Jong-il.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/28/idUSSEO253213 |title=North Korea drops communism, boosts "Dear Leaders" |first1=Jon |last1=Herskovitz |first2=Christine |last2=Kim |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=17 July 2011 |work=Reuters |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816144214/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/28/idUSSEO253213 |archive-date=16 August 2011 }}</ref> However, the constitution retains references to socialism.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2016/06/n-korea-updates-constitution-expanding-kim-jong-uns-position|title=N.Korea updates constitution expanding Kim Jong Un's position|author=JH Ahn|work=NK News|date=30 June 2016}}</ref> ''Juche''{{'}}s concepts of self-reliance have evolved with time and circumstances, but still provide the groundwork for the spartan austerity, sacrifice and discipline demanded by the party.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=207}} Scholar [[Brian Reynolds Myers]] views North Korea's actual ideology as a [[Korean ethnic nationalism]] similar to [[statism in Shōwa Japan]] and European [[fascism]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://feer.com/reviews/2009/december51/the-cleanest-race-how-north-koreans-see-themselves-and-why-it-matters|title = Review of ''The Cleanest Race''|author = Andrei Lankov|date = 4 December 2009|work = Far Eastern Economic Review|accessdate = 5 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100104035159/http://feer.com/reviews/2009/december51/the-cleanest-race-how-north-koreans-see-themselves-and-why-it-matters|archive-date =4 January 2010|author-link = Andrei Lankov}}</ref><ref>[[Christopher Hitchens]]: [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2010/02/a_nation_of_racist_dwarfs.html A Nation of Racist Dwarfs – Kim Jong-il's regime is even weirder and more despicable than you thought] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601044431/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2010/02/a_nation_of_racist_dwarfs.html |date=1 June 2012 }} (2010)</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Brian Reynolds Myers |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704471504574445980801810944 |title=The Constitution of Kim Jong Il. |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=20 December 2012 |quote=From its beginnings in 1945 the regime has espoused—to its subjects if not to its Soviet and Chinese aid-providers—a race-based, paranoid nationalism that has nothing to do with Marxism-Leninism.

North Korea is ruled by the Kim dynasty, which in North Korea is referred to as the ''Mount Paektu Bloodline''. It is a three-generation lineage descending from the country's first [[Leader of North Korea|leader]], [[Kim Il-sung]]. Kim developed [[North Korean cult of personality|a cult of personality]] closely tied to the state philosophy of ''[[Juche]]'', which was later passed on to his successors: his son [[Kim Jong-il]] and grandson [[Kim Jong-un]]. In 2013, this lineage was made explicit when Clause 2 of Article 10 of the newly edited ''Ten Fundamental Principles of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Korean Workers' Party]]'' stated that the party and revolution must be carried "eternally" by the "Mount Paektu Bloodline".<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081301558.html The Twisted Logic of the N.Korean Regime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113064929/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081301558.html |date=13 January 2017 }}.

Claims that the dynasty has been deified are contested by North Korea researcher [[Brian Reynolds Myers|B. R. Myers]]: "Divine powers have never been attributed to either of the two Kims. In fact, the propaganda apparatus in Pyongyang has generally been careful ''not'' to make claims that run directly counter to citizens' experience or common sense."{{Sfn|Myers|2011|p=7}} He further explains that the state propaganda painted Kim Jong-il as someone whose expertise lay in military matters and that the famine of the 1990s was partially caused by natural disasters out of Kim Jong-il's control.{{Sfn|Myers|2011|p=114, 116}}

According to Human Rights Watch, which cites interviews with defectors, North Korean women are routinely subjected to sexual violence, unwanted sexual contact, and rape. Men in positions of power, including police, high-ranking officials, market supervisors, and guards can abuse women at will and are not prosecuted for it. It happens so often that it is accepted as a routine part of life. Women assume they can not do anything about it. The only ones with protection are those whose husbands or fathers are themselves in positions of power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korean-women-suffer-serious-sexual-violence-by-authorities-report-says|title=North Korean women suffer serious sexual violence by authorities, report says|author=Kathleen Joyce|work=Fox News|date=1 November 2018|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of North Korea}}
North Korea has maintained one of the most closed and centralized economies in the world since the 1940s.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p = 135}} For several decades, it followed the Soviet pattern of five-year plans with the ultimate goal of achieving self-sufficiency. Extensive Soviet and Chinese support allowed North Korea to rapidly recover from the Korean War and register very high growth rates. Systematic inefficiency began to arise around 1960, when the economy shifted from the [[extensive growth|extensive]] to the [[intensive growth|intensive development]] stage. The shortage of skilled labor, energy, arable land and transportation significantly impeded long-term growth and resulted in consistent failure to meet planning objectives.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p = 138}} The major slowdown of the economy contrasted with South Korea, which surpassed the North in terms of absolute [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and per capita income by the 1980s.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p = 142}} North Korea declared the last seven-year plan unsuccessful in December 1993 and thereafter stopped announcing plans.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p = 140}}

The loss of [[Eastern Bloc]] trading partners and a series of natural disasters throughout the 1990s caused severe hardships, including widespread [[famine]]. By 2000, the situation improved owing to a massive international food assistance effort, but the economy continues to suffer from food shortages, dilapidated infrastructure and a critically low energy supply.<ref name="EB Economy" /> In an attempt to recover from the collapse, the government began structural reforms in 1998 that formally legalized [[private property|private ownership]] of assets and decentralized control over production.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|pp = 143, 145}} A second round of reforms in 2002 led to an expansion of market activities, partial [[monetization]], flexible prices and salaries, and the introduction of incentives and accountability techniques.{{Sfn|Country Profile|2007|p = 9}} Despite these changes, North Korea remains a [[command economy]] where the state owns almost all means of production and development priorities are defined by the government.<ref name="EB Economy">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/322222/North-Korea/34929/Economy |title=Economy |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=31 May 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706041908/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/322222/North-Korea/34929/Economy |archive-date=6 July 2014 }}</ref>

===Room 39 and the "Royal Court" economy===
{{main|Room 39}}

According to high-level North Korean defectors, since the 1970s, revenue accumulated through foreign currency, revenue which is wholly separate from the official economic organs of the state, is of economic significance. The scale of its significance remains unknown and is a closely guarded secret, however. More recently, this foreign currency is said to have been also derived from the over 100,000 North Korean migrant workers sent around the world, and who contribute the lionshare of their income to [[Room 39|this "Royal Court" fund]]. Other banking, trade and financial ventures (many of which are illicit) are also said to be significant contributors. The fund is reported to be primarily tasked with providing the capital needed to develop the country's military technology (above all else, its [[Timeline of the North Korean nuclear program|nuclear weapons program]]), as well as contributing to a system of "gift giving" for the country's political, military and business elite.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmqV2vIXpUY "North Korea: All the dictator's men,"] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', March 30, 2019.</ref>

Kim Il-sung's personal works are considered "classical masterpieces" while the ones created under his instruction are labeled "models of ''Juche'' literature". These include ''The Fate of a Self-Defense Corps Man'', ''The Song of Korea'' and ''Immortal History'', a series of historical novels depicting the suffering of Koreans under Japanese occupation.<ref name="LCCS Culture"/><ref name="LCCS Lit"/> More than four million literary works were published between the 1980s and the early 2000s, but almost all of them belong to a narrow variety of political genres like "army-first revolutionary literature".{{sfn|North Korea Handbook|2003|p=475}}

[[Science fiction]] is considered a secondary genre because it somewhat departs from the traditional standards of detailed descriptions and metaphors of the leader. The exotic settings of the stories give authors more freedom to depict [[cyberwarfare]], [[violence]], [[sexual abuse]] and [[crime]], which are absent in other genres. Sci-fi works glorify technology and promote the Juche concept of [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric existence]] through depictions of [[robotics]], [[space exploration]] and [[immortality]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sinonk.com/2013/09/25/from-pyongyang-to-mars-sci-fi-genre-and-literary-value-in-north-korea/ |title=Benoit Symposium: From Pyongyang to Mars: Sci-fi, Genre, and Literary Value in North Korea |publisher=SinoNK |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613021918/http://sinonk.com/2013/09/25/from-pyongyang-to-mars-sci-fi-genre-and-literary-value-in-north-korea/ |archive-date=13 June 2014 }}</ref>
