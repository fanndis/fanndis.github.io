[[File:Mézières - Christin - Tranlé.jpg|thumb|255px|Creators of ''Valérian and Laureline'': Eveline Tranlé (colorist), Pierre Christin (writer), Jean-Claude Mézières (illustrator)]]
'''''Valérian and Laureline''''' ({{lang-fr|Valérian et Laureline}}), also known as '''''Valérian: Spatio-Temporal Agent''''' ({{lang-fr|Valérian, agent spatio-temporel}}) or just '''''Valérian''''', is a French [[science fiction]] [[comics]] series, created by writer [[Pierre Christin]] and artist [[Jean-Claude Mézières]]. First published in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine in 1967, the final installment was published in 2010. All of the ''Valérian'' stories have been collected in [[comics album|comic album]] format, comprising some twenty-one volumes plus a [[short story]] collection and an [[encyclopaedia]].

The series focuses on the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a [[Spacetime|spatio-temporal]] agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the universe through space and time. Valérian is a classical [[hero]], kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, that it is the wrong thing to do. On the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes [[space opera]] with [[time travel]] plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing [[liberalism|liberal]] political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture,<ref>[http://www.afnews.info/wordpress/2010/01/06/valerian-e-laureline-la-serie-chiude-dopo-43-anni/ Italian announcement of final issue]</ref> and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs can be found in science fiction films such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Fifth Element]]''.

Many of the stories have been translated into several languages, including English.<ref name="Languages">{{cite web | title = Valerian eri kielillä - Valérian in different languages | url = http://www.saunalahti.fi/~alatera/Valerian/eri_kielet.html | accessdate = 16 September 2006 }}</ref> The series has received recognition through a number of prestigious awards, including the [[Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême]]. An [[animated television series]], ''[[Time Jam: Valerian & Laureline]]'', was released in 2007, and a feature film directed by [[Luc Besson]], ''[[Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets]]'', was released in 2017.

==Concept and setting==
The original setting for the series was the 28th century. Humanity has discovered the means of travelling instantaneously through time and space. The capital of Earth, Galaxity, is the centre of the vast Terran Galactic Empire. Earth itself has become a virtual [[utopia]] with most of the population living a life of leisure in a [[virtual reality]] dream-state ruled by the benign [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|Technocrats]] of the First Circle. The Spatio-Temporal Service protects the planets of the Terran Empire and guards against [[temporal paradox]]es caused by rogue time-travellers. Valérian and Laureline are two such spatio-temporal agents.<ref name="Bad Dreams">

However, since the end of the story ''[[Les Foudres d'Hypsis|The Wrath of Hypsis]]'' (''Les Foudres d'Hypsis'') in which Galaxity disappears from space-time as a result of a temporal paradox the pair have become freelance trouble-shooters travelling through space and time offering their services to anyone willing to hire them while also searching for their lost home.

In the first two albums Valérian travels through time in a two-seater device, the ''XB27'', which transports him to the various relay stations that Galaxity has hidden throughout time (e.g. in ''[[Les Mauvais Rêves|Bad Dreams]]'' (''Les Mauvais Rêves'') the relay is hidden below a tavern). In subsequent stories Valérian and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship ''XB982'' (which made its debut appearance in 1969 in the short story ''[[Across the Pathways of Space#The Great Collector (Le Grand Collectionneur)|The Great Collector]]'' (''Le Grand Collectionneur'').<ref>

</ref> The astroship is able to travel anywhere using a spatio-temporal jump, a sort of [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] drive enabling near-instant transportation anywhere in space and time.

The initial albums were generally straightforward [[conflict between good and evil|good versus evil]] adventure stories. However, thanks to Pierre Christin's interests in [[politics]], [[sociology]] and [[ethnology]], as the series progressed the situations typically arose from misunderstandings or [[ideological]] differences between various groups that could be resolved through reason and perseverance.<ref name="CJ#129">{{cite journal|last=Pomerleau |first=Luc |date=May 1989 |title=Pierre Christin and Enki Bilal, Called to Comics |journal=The Comics Journal |issue=129 |pages=62–67 |issn=0194-7869 |url=http://www.rpkbd.com/bilal/tcj129.htm |accessdate=2 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519051157/http://www.rpkbd.com/bilal/tcj129.htm |archive-date=19 May 2006 }}
</ref> The core theme of the stories is an optimistic [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[humanism]]: the adventures are not about defeating enemies but about exploring, facing challenges, and celebrating [[Multiculturalism|diversity]].<ref name="CJ#129" /> Thus, according to academic John Dean, Christin "as a rule works into his narratives political, [[environmentalism|environmental]] and [[feminism|feminist]] concerns – thereby showing social ills are universal, no matter on what planet you land".<ref name="Interlude">

==Principal characters==
===Valérian===
Valérian was born on Earth, in Galaxity, capital of the Terran Galactic Empire in the 28th century. He joined the Spatio-Temporal Service in the year 2713. He has been trained to think that Galaxity is always right – even when he receives orders that go against his morals he will, reluctantly, follow them. He much prefers to be a man of action than sitting around pondering what course to take next.

The early stories present Valérian as a typical square-jawed [[hero]] figure, who is strong and dependable (although an early running joke was that despite being a time-traveller he is always running late, especially when summoned by his boss). However, as the series progresses, he is increasingly portrayed as somewhat knuckle-headed. In ''[[World Without Stars]]'' (''Le Pays sans étoile''), he gets recklessly drunk on the colonists' home-made booze, in ''[[On the False Earths]]'' (''Sur les terres truquées''), the historian, Jadna, views him as useful only as cannon fodder and nothing else while in ''[[Heroes of the Equinox]]'' (''Les Héros de l'Equinoxe''), he comes across as woefully inadequate compared with the champions he is competing against. Although devoted to Laureline, he has been led astray by other women, such as in ''Heroes of the Equinox'' and ''[[Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos]]''.

When Galaxity disappears in ''The Wrath of Hypsis'' he contemplates following his fellows into oblivion, much to Laureline's horror. Even afterwards, he feels the loss of Galaxity much more than Laureline, as it is his birthplace.

The name Valérian comes from Eastern Europe,<ref name="DBD">

</ref> although its origin is Latin, from ''valere'' ("to be strong").<ref name="valerius">
 url = http://www.behindthename.com/name/valerius
</ref> Valérian was created by Mézières and Christin as a reaction to the fearless boy-scout (e.g. ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'') and American [[superhero]] characters that were prevalent in comics available in France at the time. Instead they sought to devise a "banal character" with "no extraordinary means of action".<ref name="CJ#129" />  Eventually, with Christin feeling that they had gone too far with this angle and that the Valérian character had become too stupid, from ''[[The Ghosts of Inverloch]]'' (''Les Spectres d'Inverloch'') onwards, Valérian was made more sympathetic and given a greater piece of the action.<ref name="CJ#129" />

In ''[[Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets]]'', a 2017 movie by [[Luc Besson]], Valérian is played by [[Dane DeHaan]].

===Laureline===
Laureline is a peasant girl from 11th century France. In the debut adventure, ''Bad Dreams'', she rescues Valérian from the enchanted Forest of Arelaune. When she accidentally discovers Valérian is a time-traveller, he is forced to bring her back with him to Galaxity where she is trained as a Spatio-Temporal Agent and assigned as his partner.

In the early stories, Laureline generally sits in the background while Valérian saves the day in whatever situation the pair have found themselves, but her position changes as the series develop. ''World Without Stars'', the fourth serial published in ''Pilote'', the two characters are separated for most of the adventure, with Laureline stepping out from under Valérian's shadow for the first time, and she proves to be more than an equal to Valérian in ensuring that their mission succeeds.

''[[Welcome to Alflolol]]'' (''Bienvenue sur Alflolol'') brings Laureline's rebellious nature to the fore; unlike Valérian, she has not been born and raised by Galaxity and is prepared not only to question Galaxity's authorities but to rebel openly against them when their orders run contrary to her sense of morality. It also demonstrates her impulsive streak; she sides with the native Alflololians against Galaxity and Valérian with no thought for the personal consequences she may have to face herself. Her position as the true star of the series is cemented in ''[[Ambassador of the Shadows]]'' (''L'Ambassadeur des Ombres''), which is virtually a solo adventure for her as she searches the vast space station Point Central for the kidnapped Valérian and the Earth Ambassador. Later, when acting as independent agents, it is Laureline who questions the ethics of some of the jobs they are forced to take to make ends meet, notably in ''[[The Living Weapons]]'' (''Les Armes Vivantes'').

Despite being independent and efficacious, Laureline is not afraid to exploit her considerable sex appeal if it is to her advantage. For example, she attracts the attention of the Emperor of Valsennar in ''World Without Stars'' and, dressed in leather gear and boots, she manipulates Crocbattler and Rackalust in ''Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos'' and regularly charms the [[#The Shingouz|Shingouz]] when negotiating with them for information. She has appeared nude in some adventures.  Mézières drew a picture of her for the French edition of ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1987.<ref name="Extras#1">

She also has a certain affinity for animals such as the Alflololian Goumon in ''Welcome to Alflolol'', the Grumpy Converter from Bluxte, first seen in ''Ambassador of the Shadows'', and the Tüm Tüm (de Lüm) and the [[Tchoung (Valérian)|Tchoung-Tracer]], both introduced in ''[[On the Frontiers]]'' (''Sur les Frontières'').

The name "Laureline" was invented by Mézières and Christin who were seeking a name that would sound "medieval" and "soft".<ref name="DBD" /> The name has proven popular and there are now several thousand women in France named Laureline, the first one born in 1968, just a year after the publication of ''Bad Dreams''. There have also been variations such as "Loreline" and "Laurelyne".<ref>

In ''[[Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets]]'', a 2017 movie by [[Luc Besson]], Laureline is played by [[Cara Delevingne]].

===Other characters===

====Mr Albert====
[[File:Mister Albert.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Mr Albert]]
Mr Albert is Galaxity's contact on 20th century Earth. He makes his first appearance in ''[[Métro Châtelet, Direction Cassiopeia]]''.<ref name="Métro Châtelet, Direction Cassiopeia">

 | year = 1980
 | publisher = Dargaud 
 | location = Paris
 | language = fr
 | isbn = 2-205-04639-X }}
</ref> He is a retired gentleman who drives an obsolete [[Renault 4CV]] and lives in the [[suburb]]s of [[Paris]], France. He maintains a wide range of contacts in government and scientific circles as well as with many experts in fields outside the mainstream such as [[ufology]], [[telepathy]], and [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. He is also a [[pigeon keeping|pigeon fancier]] and uses his [[carrier pigeon]]s to relay messages between some of his contacts. Unlike Valérian he tries to avoid getting involved in the thick of the action and never acts impulsively, always preferring to take his time about things. He enjoys the finer things in life: gourmet cuisine, fine wines and likes to take things easy.

The character of Albert is partially influenced by that of August Faust, the main character in the strip ''The Extraordinary and Troubling Adventure of Mr August Faust'' (''L'extraordinaire et Troublante Aventure de M. August Faust''), written by [[Fred (comics)|Fred]] and drawn by Mézières in 1967.<ref name = "DBD" /> {{clear}}

====The Shingouz====
[[File:Three shingouz, from "The Ghosts of Inverloch".jpg|upright|thumb|Three shingouz, from "The Ghosts of Inverloch"]]
The Shingouz are aliens who make their first appearance in ''Ambassador of the Shadows'' and re-appear regularly throughout the subsequent albums. They are brown, short-furred creatures, slightly less than a metre tall, resembling flightless [[bird]]s with a [[snout]] instead of a [[beak]].

Shingouz have a high [[alcohol tolerance]] and preference for strong [[alcoholic beverage]]s, which they consume in large quantities. The Shingouz society is [[capitalism|capitalist]] to the extreme. Shingouz want a profit from everything they do. They are especially adept in trading important and sensitive information to interested parties. Valérian and Laureline have struck up a relationship with a group of three Shingouz who have a particularly useful network of contacts in all the major space communities. They are especially fond of Laureline, which she often uses to her advantage in striking favourable deals with them.<ref>

[[File:Valerian Astroship.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Valérian and Laureline’s Astroship, the XB982, as it appears in ''[[Orphan of the Stars]]'' (''L'Orphelin des Astres'')</center>]]
Childhood friends Jean-Claude Mézières and Pierre Christin had previously collaborated on the comic strip ''Le Rhum du Punch'' (''Rum Punch'') in 1966 while both were living and working in the United States.<ref name="DBD" />  Upon their return to France they initially intended to create a [[Western (genre)|Western]] strip but, with the genre already well represented in French comics thanks to ''[[Lucky Luke]]'', ''[[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]'' and ''[[Jerry Spring]]'', Christin instead proposed that they turn their hand to science fiction, a genre he felt was unrepresented in French comics at the time.<ref name="CJ#129" />  The decision to work in the science fiction genre was also influenced by the political climate in France at the time; Mézières and Christin saw ''Valérian'' as a "backdoor" means to react against the prevailing doctrine of [[Gaullism]].<ref name="CJ#129" /> Although science fiction was not a favourite of ''Pilote'' editor [[René Goscinny]], Goscinny wanted his magazine to be diverse and innovative and so agreed to commission ''Valérian''.<ref name="DBD" />

There had been French science fiction comics before ''Valérian'' such as Kline's ''Kaza the Martian'' (a childhood favourite of Mézières),<ref name="DBD" /> Roger Lecureux and [[Raymond Poivet]]'s ''Les Pionniers de l'Espérance'' ''(The Pioneers of Hope)'' (which Christin found tired and repetitive)<ref name="CJ#129" /> and [[Jean-Claude Forest]]'s ''[[Barbarella (comic book)|Barbarella]]''.  ''Barbarella'' is famous for its strong, female, titular character, but Christin has denied any influence on the character of Laureline stating that she was inspired by [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s ''[[The Second Sex]]'' as well as the burgeoning feminist movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name="ABC">

Christin has also cited the [[whodunit]] genre—notably novels by [[Georges Simenon]] and [[Ed McBain]]—as an influence on ''Valérian'' since they taught him, as a writer, that all characters in a narrative must be seen to have motivations.<ref name="ABC" />

Mézières' drawings in the early albums were influenced by such "[[Franco-Belgian comics#"Comic-Dynamic" style|comic-dynamic]]" artists as [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] (''[[Lucky Luke]]''), [[André Franquin]] (''[[Spirou et Fantasio]]'') and [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] ([[Mad magazine|''Mad'' magazine]]),<ref name="U#23" /> leading Jean-Pierre Andrevon to refer to ''Valérian'' as "a kind of ''Lucky Luke'' of space-time".<ref name="Andrevon_1970" /> As the series progressed, Mézières developed a more realistic style, akin to that of [[Jijé]], though in more recent albums he has returned to the more cartoonish style of the earlier stories.<ref name="U#23" />

==Legacy==

===In comics===
''Valérian's'' arrival on the French comics scene was contemporaneous with the debuts of other notable French science fiction strips including ''[[Luc Orient]]'' by [[Michel Regnier|Greg]] and [[Eddy Paape]] and ''[[Lone Sloane]]'' by [[Philippe Druillet]].<ref name="U#23" /><ref name="Shadowmen2">

Mézières has also noticed similarities between some of the sets in the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' and the planet seen in ''[[Birds of the Master]]'' (''Les Oiseaux du Maître'') and between some of the production sketches for the alien fighters in the 1996 film ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' and Valérian and Laureline's astroship.<ref name="DBD" />

The 1999 [[Denmark|Danish]] film ''[[Mifune's Last Song]]'', directed by [[Søren Kragh-Jacobsen]], features a character, Rud, who is a fan of ''Linda and Valentin'' (as ''Valérian'' is known in Denmark) who believes the character of Liva is in fact Linda (i.e. Laureline).<ref>

Jean-Claude Mézières himself has worked as a concept artist on a number of science fiction film projects. The first of these was in 1984 for director [[Jeremy Kagan]] who was attempting to adapt [[René Barjavel]]'s novel ''[[La Nuit des temps]]'' (''The Ice People''). The film was never made. This was followed, in 1985, by a proposed adaptation of [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]'s novel ''[[Hard to Be a God]]'' for director [[Peter Fleischmann]]. This film was eventually finished in 1989 though Mézières' concepts for the film were barely used. The art Mézières produced for both projects was later published in ''Mézières Extras''.<ref name="DBD" /><ref name="Extras#1" />

In 1991 Mézières began work producing concept art for the director [[Luc Besson]] for his film ''[[The Fifth Element]]''. When the project stalled and Besson moved on to work on the film ''[[Léon (film)|Léon]]'' in 1994, Mézières returned to ''Valérian'' for the album ''[[The Circles of Power]]'' (''Les Cercles du Pouvoir''). This featured a character, S'Traks, who drove a flying taxi around a great metropolis on the planet Rubanis.<ref>

==Publication history==
{{See also|List of Valérian and Laureline books}}

===Original publication===
''Valérian'' first appeared on 9 November 1967 in issue #420 of the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Pilote]]'',<ref name="BDO-pilote67">{{cite web | url =http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/annees/1967.htm | title =Le journal Pilote en 1967 | work =BDoubliées | accessdate =22 March 2007 | language = fr }}</ref> and every ''Valérian'' story from ''Bad Dreams'' to ''The Wrath of Hypsis'' was initially serialised in ''Pilote''. The second ''Valérian'' story, ''[[The City of Shifting Waters]]'' (''La Cité des Eaux Mouvantes''), was the first to be collected in [[graphic novel]] album format by [[Dargaud]]. Since ''On the Frontiers'', every ''Valérian'' story has debuted in album format. Seven short stories were also published in the [[digest-sized]] ''Super Pocket Pilote'' in 1969 and 1970 and later collected in ''[[Across the Pathways of Space]]'' (''Par Les Chemins De l’Espace'') in 1997. The series was originally published under the title ''Valérian: Spatio-Temporal Agent''. However, with the publication of ''[[The Order of the Stones]]'' in 2007, the series now goes under the title ''Valérian and Laureline''.

On 22 January 2010, the last album, ''[[L'OuvreTemps]]'' (''The Time Opener''), was published. With this album the authors concluded the entire comic series with the intention to prevent the series from becoming weak, or staggering behind newer comics. However, Christin has written a 270-page Valérian and Laureline novel, '''''Valérian et Laureline: Lininil a disparu'' (Valérian and Laureline: Lininil Has Disappeared)''', and indicated that Valérian and Laureline will continue to live on in a yet unspecified form.<ref name="matin">{{cite web | url=http://www.lematin.ch/loisirs/culture/pierre-christin-«jai-écrit-ce-roman-parce-que-valérian-sarrête»-11091 | title=Pierre Christin: "J'ai écrit ce roman parce que Valérian s'arrête" | publisher=Le Matin | date=17 October 2009 | accessdate=28 October 2011 | author=Destraz, Camille}}</ref>

The first ''Valérian'' album to be translated into English was ''Ambassador of the Shadows'' which was serialised across four issues of the magazine ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' in 1981 (Volume 4, Number 10 (January 1981) to Volume 5, Number 1 (April 1981)).<ref name="Amazing#160">

''Ambassador of the Shadows'' was later republished in English in album format as were ''World Without Stars'', ''Welcome to Alflolol'' and ''Heroes of the Equinox'' by the short-lived Dargaud-USA and Dargaud-Canada between 1981 and 1984 and in the United Kingdom by Hodder-Dargaud in 1984 and 1985.<ref name="Amazing#160" />

In 1989 it was announced that [[NBM Publishing]] were going to reissue the four English language albums published by Dargaud-USA and also release a translation of ''Empire of a Thousand Planets'' but nothing seems to have come of this.<ref name="Amazing#160" />

''Heroes of the Equinox'' was republished in July 1996 in black and white by ''Fantasy Flight Publishing'' (an offshoot of ''[[Fantasy Flight Games]]'') in two issues as standard American sized [[comic-book]]s as part of an unsuccessful attempt to translate and print several European comic book series including ''[[Spirou et Fantasio]]'' and ''Lucky Luke''.<ref>

Since July 2010, UK publisher [[Cinebook]] has been publishing English language editions of Valérian. These began at a rate of one volume every six months.

===In other languages===
Many of the ''Valérian'' stories have, be it in part or in whole as a series, been translated from their original French into several other languages besides English, including [[German language|German]] (as ''Valerian und Veronique''), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (as ''Ravian: Tijd/ruimte-agent''), the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) (as ''Linda og/och Valentin''), [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (as ''Valerian ja Laureline'' and previously as ''Avaruusagentti Valerianin seikkailuja''), [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (as ''Valérian, agente espácio-temporal''), [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (as ''Valerijan''), [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Standard Chinese]].<ref name="Languages" /> "Intégrale' editions have been published in several of these languages as well, of which the later, aforementioned Cinebook version and those of its international companions incidentally, were merely slightly updated editions, only enhanced with a long interview with the two creators and film director Luc Besson, spread over the individual volumes of the collection.<ref name="stripinfo"/>

==Adaptations to other media==

===Animated television series===
{{main|Time Jam: Valerian & Laureline}}
The notion of making an animated adaptation of ''Valérian'' dates back to at least 1976.<ref name="DBD" /> In 1982, Mézières produced concept art for an episode titled ''[[The Asteroids of Shimballil]]'' (''Les Astéroïdes de Shimballil'') which was later published in 2000 as an appendix to the album release of ''Bad Dreams''. In 1991, ''Dargaud Films'' financed the production of a three-minute pilot, directed by Bernard Deyriès and animated by ''Studio 32'' in [[Paris]] and [[Luxembourg]], but nothing came of this venture. Several stills from this pilot episode were published in ''Mézières Extras''.<ref name="Extras#1" /> Another pilot, directed by Florient Ferrier, was made by the French animation studio 2 Minutes in 2001. Nothing came of this attempt either.<ref>

The series differs from the original comics in that Valerian comes from the year 2417, instead of 2720, and meets Laureline in the year 912 instead of 1000. Whereas in the comics Valerian takes Laureline back to the 28th century without any trouble, in the animated series this results in Earth disappearing from the [[solar system]].

According to Animation World Network, "''Time Jam - Valerian & Laureline'' sets out to answer the question: Where on Earth has Earth gone? Valerian and Laureline, our two young heroes, seem to be the only representatives of the human race in the unsafe galaxy where the nightmarish Vlagos are conspiring to control the world. Sent out on an assignment by the head of STS (the Spatial-Temporal Service), Valerian and Laureline discover the existence of a time-portal, a mysterious phenomenon, which may hold the key to the recovery of Earth. The series from Dargaud Marina mixes 2D and CGI animation with an [[anime]] touch".<ref>{{cite journal
