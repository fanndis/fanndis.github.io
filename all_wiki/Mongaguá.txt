'''Mongaguá''' is a municipality in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in [[Brazil]]. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of [[Baixada Santista]].<ref>[http://www.al.sp.gov.br/repositorio/legislacao/lei.complementar/1996/lei.complementar-815-30.07.1996.html Assembleia Legislativa do Estado de São Paulo, Lei Complementar Nº 815]</ref> The population is 52,492 (2015 est.) in an area of 141.87 km².<ref name=ibge>[http://cod.ibge.gov.br/2355T Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]</ref> The name comes from the [[Tupi language]]. Its seal carries the national motto of the [[United States of America]], [[E pluribus unum]].

The municipality's street plan is on a planned grid running from SSE to NNW and many of the houses are within sight of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The populated area of Mongaguá is near the bottom of steep-sloping and densely forested mountains. The [[BR-101]] superhighway linking [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]] and the southern part of the state runs through Mongaguá. The freeway to the city of [[São Paulo]] is also easily accessible. Housing developments near the beaches were built in the 1970s and the 1990s.  Prior to the construction of the housing developments, the population was mainly rural. Housing development continues to this day.

There are two [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] villages in Mongaguá: [[Aldeia Itaóca]] and [[Aguapéu]], located in the [[Atlantic Mata]] reserve. The aboriginal community of Aguapéu conceived of the project ''Jaguatareí Nhemboé'' (Walking and Learning).
