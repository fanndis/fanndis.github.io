"'''Lisa Goes Gaga'''" is the twenty-second and final episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 23)|twenty-third season]] of the American animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 20, 2012. In the episode, American singer-songwriter [[Lady Gaga]] makes a visit to Springfield, where all of its residents are in a state of depression. Main character [[Lisa Simpson]] is arguably the most depressed person in the city, prompting Gaga to go out of her way to teach Lisa the meaning of happiness.

The episode was written by [[Tim Long]] and directed by Matthew Schofield. Gaga guest-starred in the episode, portraying an animated version of herself. A fan of the show, she was brought on by showrunner [[Al Jean]], who wrote a script after [[James L. Brooks]] saw an interview of her on ''[[60 Minutes]]''. The design team conceived eighteen outfits to complement Gaga's eccentric persona, which satirized several of her outfits including her [[Lady Gaga's meat dress|meat dress]]. Recording sessions for "Lisa Goes Gaga" took place in [[Los Angeles, California]] over four days in August 2011.

Critical responses to the episode were mixed to negative; critics looked down upon the episode's concept and general execution. According to the [[Nielsen ratings]], the installment attained 4.79 million American viewers upon its original airing, making it notable as the lowest rated episode of ''The Simpsons'' up to that point.

==Plot==
[[Lady Gaga]] passes through [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] via train while on her way to a concert.  Seeing how low the city's self-esteem is, she takes it upon herself to cheer up the whole city. However, no one in town is more depressed than [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], who was voted as the most unpopular student by her peers. Lisa tries to reverse her status as one of the least popular girls in school by ghostwriting positive things about herself on the school blog under the heading "Truth Teller".

When [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] finds out her secret and reveals it to the school, her social ranking plummets to a new low until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her outburst helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her, in effect making Lady Gaga's mission successful. Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being like anyone else. Just as Lady Gaga's train begins to leave again, [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] runs up to her and asks if she can help him as well, but Lady Gaga declines, stating that she's not that good. As Moe turns and walks across the train track, a second train hits him.<!--He appears in the following episode alive, "Moonshine River"-->

"After she signed on to do it, she came in to record dialogue twice, and we showed her a rough cut the second time."<ref name=mtv2/> Recording sessions for the episode took place in [[Los Angeles]] during a period of four days from August 22–26.<ref name=EW/> Gaga was initially apprehensive while recording on set, which led her to review the satirical nature of the show to get a better understanding on how to perform. "Their characters are so awesomely convincing and sincere and wild and funny, I had to remind myself constantly of the sincerity of the humor," she explained. "That's what I was trying to focus on—not putting on a character too much, and really being as sincere as I could with the lines."<ref name=EW/> Despite such emotions, Gaga professed that working with the staff of the show was "one of the coolest things that [she] has ever done".<ref name=EW/>

Several employees of ''The Simpsons'' were impressed with Gaga's performance, who cited that her vocal range and ad-libbing skills were exceptional. Series creator [[Matt Groening]] stated: "Since the very beginning, I’ve always wanted to have on the most iconic personalities of our time, and she's it."<ref name=EW/> In an interview with [[E! Online]], Groening further commented on Gaga's appearance; "The great thing about having Lady Gaga is that she came in a number of times and always with a different getup. Like she'd leave the room and come back in after a break in a completely new getup. It was unbelievable. The only time that she ever took off her hat was when it was banging into the microphone."<ref name=e!>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/watch_with_kristin/jennifer_aniston_really_coming_cougar/193233 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121208190236/http://www.eonline.com/news/watch_with_kristin/jennifer_aniston_really_coming_cougar/193233 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 8, 2012 |title=The Simpsons Celebrates 500 Episodes: How Kooky Was Lady Gaga?

The design team for the series conceived eighteen outfits to complement Gaga's [[wikt:outré|outré]] and eccentric reputation, although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga's stylists or creative director [[Nicola Formichetti]].<ref name=mtv22>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2012/05/18/simpsons-producer-reveals-details-of-anticipated-lady-gaga-episode/|title='Simpsons' Producer Reveals Details Of Anticipated Lady Gaga Episode|first=John|last=Mitchell|publisher=[[MTV]] ([[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]])|date=May 18, 2012|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref> Due to the outfits' unconventional appearances, Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes, as these rapid changes "wouldn't be possible in real life".<ref name=mtv2/> "There's a moment in the episode," Jean resumed, "when she starts out with her hair down. Then, there's a curtain pulled in front of her, and in seconds, she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all hairsprayed up and big and frizzy. In real life, that would probably take 8 hours."<ref name=mtv2/> Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn, including [[Lady Gaga's meat dress|her meat dress]] and her [[Kermit the Frog]] dress. "We did a lot of research, looking back at her old outfits, and she's really been in a million different things, had a million different looks."<ref name=mtv2/>

==Cultural references==
Many aspects of Gaga's career are referenced in the episode. "You're All My Little Monsters", a musical number specifically created for the episode,<ref name=mtv2/> is a parody of Gaga's relationship with her devout "Little Monsters"—a phrase Gaga uses to refer to her fans.<ref name=bill/> To ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' columnist Devon Maloney, the song was ultimately an overtly cartoonized version of her single "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" that embraces the "freakiness" of Springfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/05/hear-lady-gagas-cartoony-90-second-simpsons-tune/|title=Hear Lady Gaga's Cartoony, 90-Second 'Simpsons' Tune|first=Devon|last=Maloney|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=May 19, 2012|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref> Several of Gaga's outfits and looks emulate several iconic costumes the singer had previously worn, such as the "Living Dress" and pyrotechnic leotard she wore during her endeavors on [[The Monster Ball Tour]], as well as her wardrobe at the [[53rd Grammy Awards]].<ref name=mtv22/> One in particular, a dress consisting of [[pork chops]], is a parody of the singer's [[Lady Gaga's meat dress|meat dress]], which she wore at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref name=mtv2/> During the end credits of the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] performs a rendition of "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]". At the end of the episode, a title card promotes the [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]-starring short film ''[[The Longest Daycare]]'' (2012), which was shown before ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/05/22/the-simpsons-short-film/|title='The Simpsons': Exclusive details on the next big-screen adventure (it's short, silent, and in 3-D)!|first=Dan|last=Snierson|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=May 23, 2012|date=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

The episode produced varying responses from television commentators, and mostly mixed to negative reviews from viewers. "Lisa Goes Gaga" provoked ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' journalist Rowan Kaiser to conclude that the installment "wasn't that painful to watch"—albeit found the concept and general execution to be irritating.<ref name=av/> In her B– review, Kaiser asserted that "Lisa Goes Gaga" used a straight-forward interpretation of the singer, and felt that Lady Gaga's appearance was superior to previous guest appearances. "So many ''Simpsons'' celebrity voices," she stated, "show up for a few minutes at most, with ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]''-style 'Wow, [[Chris Martin]] of [[Coldplay]], what are you doing here?' Or they voice one-off characters without enough flair to be memorable. Instead, Gaga was the focus of the entire episode, to the point where if you wanted to call it a half-hour commercial for Lady Gaga, you probably wouldn’t be wrong. Fortunately for 'Lisa Goes Gaga', the celebrity at its heart is entertaining enough that it being her commercial isn’t a complete waste of time."<ref name=av>{{cite news|last=Kaiser|first=Rowan|title='Lisa Goes Gaga'|url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/lisa-goes-gaga,75201/|accessdate=May 20, 2012|newspaper=[[The A.V.

"The series did make good use of their guest star instead of reducing her role to a small cameo," opined ''TV Fanatic''{{'s}} Teresa L., who concluded: "The episode ended up turning into one long-running gag about Gaga's eccentricities and a rehashing of all her most 'shocking' moments."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2012/05/the-simpsons-review-lady-blah-blah/#ixzz1vZdgtBTv|title=The Simpsons Review: Lady Blah-Blah|first=Teresa|last=L.|work=TV Fanatic|date=May 20, 2012|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref> Jocelyn W. of ''TV Equals'' said, "Lady Gaga helped ''The Simpsons'' end its 23rd season on a memorable note."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvequals.com/2012/05/21/the-simpsons-lisa-goes-gaga-review/|title=The Simpsons “Lisa Goes Gaga” Review|first=Jocelyn|last=W.|publisher=TV Equals|date=May 21, 2012|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

==Super Bowl LI halftime similarities==
Right after Gaga performed in the [[Super Bowl LI halftime show]], many media outlets pointed out similarities between the beginning of the show where she descended from the roof of [[NRG Stadium]] from a harness to a similar scene in this episode in which she descends from a helicopter on a harness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-simpsons-predicted-lady-gagas-super-bowl-performance_us_58985568e4b040613137bb82|title=‘The Simpsons’ Predicted Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl Halftime Show|first=Ron|last=Dicker|work=The Huffington Post|date=February 6, 2017|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/02/the-simpsons-predicted-lady-gaga-super-bowl-halftime-show-2012-1201903217/|title=‘The Simpsons’ Predicted Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl Halftime Show In 2012|first=Denise|last=Petski|work=Deadline|date=February 6, 2017|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7678106/remember-when-the-simpsons-totally-predicted-lady-gagas-super-bowl|title=Remember When 'The Simpsons' Totally Predicted Lady Gaga's Super Bowl Halftime Set?|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|work=Billboard|date=February 6, 2017|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}</ref>
