{{short description|Trading of a public company's stock or other securities by individuals with access to nonpublic information about the company}}

'''Insider trading''' is the trading of a [[public company]]'s [[stock]] or other [[security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[bond (finance)|bonds]] or [[Option (finance)|stock options]]) based on material, nonpublic information about the company. In various countries, some kinds of trading based on insider information is illegal. This is because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information, as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make. The rules governing insider trading are complex and vary significantly from country to country. The extent of enforcement also varies from one country to another. The definition of insider in one jurisdiction can be broad, and may cover not only insiders themselves but also any persons related to them, such as brokers, associates, and even family members. A person who becomes aware of [[market moving information|non-public information]] and trades on that basis may be guilty of a crime.

Trading by specific insiders, such as employees, is commonly permitted as long as it does not rely on material information not in the [[public domain]]. Many jurisdictions require that such trading be reported so that the transactions can be monitored. In the United States and several other jurisdictions, trading conducted by corporate officers, key employees, directors, or significant shareholders must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed, usually within a few business days of the trade. In these cases, insiders in the United States are required to file a [[Form 4]] with the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) when buying or selling shares of their own companies. The authors of one study claim that illegal insider trading raises the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.<ref>[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf "The World Price of Insider Trading"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503043733/https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf |date=2018-05-03 }} by [[Utpal Bhattacharya]] and [[Hazem Daouk]] in the [[Journal of Finance]], Vol. LVII, No. 1 (February 2002)</ref> However, some economists, such as [[Henry Manne]], have argued that insider trading should be allowed and could, in fact, benefit markets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/26/insider-trading-makes-us-richer-better-informed-and-could-prevent-corporate-scandals-legalize-it/|title=Insider trading enriches and informs us, and could prevent scandals.

There has long been "considerable academic debate" among business and legal scholars over whether or not insider trading should be illegal.{{sfnp|Klein|Ramseyer|Bainbridge|2018|p=481}} Several arguments against outlawing insider trading have been identified: for example, although insider trading is illegal, most insider trading is never detected by law enforcement, and thus the illegality of insider trading might give the public the potentially misleading impression that "stock market trading is an unrigged game that anyone can play."{{sfnp|Klein|Ramseyer|Bainbridge|2018|p=481}} Some legal analysis has questioned whether insider trading actually harms anyone in the legal sense, since some have questioned whether insider trading causes anyone to suffer an actual "loss," and whether anyone who suffers a loss is owed an actual legal duty by the insiders in question.{{sfnp|Klein|Ramseyer|Bainbridge|2018|p=481}}

==Illegal==
Rules prohibiting or criminalizing insider trading on material non-public information exist in most jurisdictions around the world (Bhattacharya and Daouk, 2002), but the details and the efforts to enforce them vary considerably. In the United States, Sections 16(b) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 directly and indirectly address insider trading. The U.S. Congress enacted this law after the stock market crash of 1929.<ref name=Newkirk/> While the United States is generally viewed as making the most serious efforts to enforce its insider trading laws,<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=967482 "Law and the Market: The Impact of Enforcement"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306000649/http://ssrn.com/abstract=967482 |date=2011-03-06 }} by John C. Coffee, University of Pennsylvania Law Review (December 2007)</ref> the broader scope of the European model legislation provides a stricter framework against illegal insider trading.<ref name="Masters" /><ref name="Ventoruzzo">{{cite web|last=Ventoruzzo |first=Marco |date=19 June 2014 |title=Comparing Insider Trading in the US and Europe |publisher=Harvard Law School |url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/06/19/comparing-insider-trading-in-the-us-and-europe/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630185840/http://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/06/19/comparing-insider-trading-in-the-us-and-europe/ |archive-date=30 June 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the European Union and the United Kingdom all trading on non-public information is, under the rubric of [[market abuse]], subject at a minimum to civil penalties and to possible criminal penalties as well.<ref name="Ventoruzzo" /> UK's [[Financial Conduct Authority]] has the responsibility to investigate and prosecute insider dealing, defined by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1993]].

===Definition of "insider"===
In the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany and Romania for mandatory reporting purposes, corporate insiders are defined as a company's officers, directors and any beneficial owners of more than 10% of a class of the company's equity securities. Trades made by these types of insiders in the company's own stock, based on material non-public information, are considered fraudulent since the insiders are violating the [[fiduciary duty]] that they owe to the shareholders. The corporate insider, simply by accepting employment, has undertaken a legal obligation to the shareholders to put the shareholders' interests before their own, in matters related to the corporation. When insiders buy or sell based upon company-owned information, they are said to be violating their obligation to the shareholders.

For example, illegal insider trading would occur if the [[chief executive officer]] of Company A learned (prior to a public announcement) that Company A will be taken over and then bought shares in Company A while knowing that the share price would likely rise.

In the United States and many other jurisdictions, however, "insiders" are not just limited to corporate officials and major shareholders where illegal insider trading is concerned but can include any individual who trades shares based on material non-public information in violation of some duty of trust. This duty may be imputed; for example, in many jurisdictions, in cases of where a corporate insider "tips" a friend about non-public information likely to have an effect on the company's share price, the duty the corporate insider owes the company is now imputed to the friend and the friend violates a duty to the company if he trades on the basis of this information.

===Liability===
Liability for inside trading violations generally cannot be avoided by passing on the information in an "I scratch your back; you scratch mine" or ''[[quid pro quo]]'' arrangement if the person receiving the information knew or should have known that the information was material non-public information. In the United States, at least one court has indicated that the insider who releases the non-public information must have done so for an improper purpose. In the case of a person who receives the insider information (called the "tippee"), the tippee must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose.<ref name="United States v 2014">''United States v. Newman'', 773 F.3d 438 (2d Cir. 2014).</ref>

One commentator has argued that if Company A's CEO did not trade on undisclosed [[takeover]] news, but instead passed the information on to his brother-in-law who traded on it, illegal insider trading would still have occurred (albeit by proxy, by passing it on to a "non-insider" so Company A's CEO would not get his hands dirty).<ref name=Harris>Larry Harris, Trading & Exchanges, Oxford Press, Oxford, 2003. Chapter 29 "Insider Trading"</ref>{{rp|589}}

===Misappropriation theory===
A newer view of insider trading, the [[misappropriation]] theory, is now accepted in U.S. law. It states that anyone who misappropriates material non-public information and trades on that information in any stock may be guilty of insider trading. This can include elucidating material non-public information from an insider with the intention of trading on it, or passing it on to someone who will.

===Proof of responsibility===
Proving that someone has been responsible for a trade can be difficult because traders may try to hide behind nominees, offshore companies, and other proxies. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) prosecutes over 50 cases each year, with many being settled administratively out of court. The SEC and several [[stock exchange]]s actively monitor trading, looking for suspicious activity.<ref name=cox>{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Charles C.|title=The Law of Insider Trading - How they get caught|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1986/112086cox.pdf|publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=March 23, 2014|date=November 20, 1986|archive-date=April 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412164311/https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1986/112086cox.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Matt|title=SEC Insider Trading Investigation Reveals SEC Is Really Good At Insider Trading Investigations, Anyway|url=http://dealbreaker.com/2013/01/sec-insider-trading-investigation-reveals-sec-is-really-good-at-insider-trading-investigations-anyway/|work=Dealbreaker|accessdate=March 23, 2014|archive-date=April 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409141331/https://dealbreaker.com/2013/01/sec-insider-trading-investigation-reveals-sec-is-really-good-at-insider-trading-investigations-anyway|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Market Surveillance |url=https://www.nyse.com/regulation/memberorganizations/1022221394213.html |publisher=NYSE EuroNext |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624062204/http://www.nyse.com/regulation/memberorganizations/1022221394213.html |archivedate=June 24, 2007 }}</ref> The SEC does not have criminal enforcement authority, but can refer serious matters to the U.S. Attorney's Office for further investigation and prosecution.

===Trading on information in general===
In the United States and most non-European jurisdictions not all trading on non-public information is illegal insider trading.<ref name="Ventoruzzo" /> For example, a person in a restaurant who hears the CEO of Company A at the next table tell the CFO that the company's profits will be higher than expected and then buys the stock is not guilty of insider trading—unless he or she had some closer connection to the company or company officers.<ref name="Shell">{{Cite magazine |last=Shell |first=G.

Notwithstanding, information about a [[tender offer]] (usually regarding a merger or acquisition) is held to a higher standard. If this type of information is obtained (directly or indirectly) and there is reason to believe it is nonpublic, there is a duty to disclose it or abstain from trading.<ref>17 C.F.R. 240.14e-3</ref>

In the United States in addition to civil penalties, the trader may also be subject to criminal prosecution for fraud or where SEC regulations have been broken, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) may be called to conduct an independent parallel investigation. If the DOJ finds criminal wrongdoing, the Department may file criminal charges.<ref>{{cite web|last=Raiser|first=Steve|title=Raiser & Kenniff|url=http://www.raiserkenniff.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/insider-trading-when-is-it-civil-or-criminal/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105020113/http://www.raiserkenniff.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/insider-trading-when-is-it-civil-or-criminal/|archivedate=2013-11-05}}</ref>

==Legal==
Legal trades by insiders are common,<ref name=Newkirk>Thomas Newkirk. (1998). [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1998/spch221.htm Speech by SEC Staff: Insider Trading – A U.S. Perspective] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119121933/https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1998/spch221.htm |date=2017-11-19 }}. 16th International Symposium on Economic Crime at Jesus College, Cambridge, England on September 19, 1998</ref> as employees of [[public company|publicly traded]] [[corporation]]s often have stock or stock options. These trades are made public in the United States through [[SEC filing|Securities and Exchange Commission filings]], mainly [[Form 4]].

U.S. [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]] clarified that the prohibition against insider trading does not require proof that an insider actually used material nonpublic information when conducting a trade; possession of such information alone is sufficient to violate the provision, and the SEC would infer that an insider in possession of material nonpublic information used this information when conducting a trade. However, SEC Rule 10b5-1 also created for insiders an [[affirmative defense]] if the insider can demonstrate that the trades conducted on behalf of the insider were conducted as part of a pre-existing [[contract]] or written binding plan for trading in the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp|title=Rule 10b5-1|date=Sep 17, 2019|website=Investopedia|url-status=live|access-date=February 9, 2020|archive-date=February 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204170810/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp}}</ref>

For example, if an insider expects to retire after a specific period of time and, as part of retirement planning, the insider has adopted a written binding plan to sell a specific amount of the company's stock every month for two years, and the insider later comes into possession of material nonpublic information about the company, trades based on the original plan might not constitute prohibited insider trading.

==United States law==
Until the 21st century and the European Union's [[market abuse]] laws, the United States was the leading country in prohibiting insider trading made on the basis of material non-public information.<ref name="Ventoruzzo" /> Thomas Newkirk and Melissa Robertson of the SEC summarize the development of US insider trading laws.<ref name=Newkirk/> Insider trading has a base offense level of 8, which puts it in Zone A under the [[U.S. Sentencing Guidelines]]. This means that first-time offenders are eligible to receive probation rather than incarceration.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S.S.G. §2B1.4 |url=http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2b1_4.htm  |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618144017/http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2b1_4.htm |archivedate=2010-06-18 }}</ref>

===Statutory===
U.S. insider trading prohibitions are based on English and American common law prohibitions against fraud. In 1909, well before the Securities Exchange Act was passed, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that a corporate director who bought that company's stock when he knew the stock's price was about to increase committed fraud by buying but not disclosing his inside information.

Section 15 of the [[Securities Act of 1933]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1933 |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |archive-date=January 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111084531/http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> contained prohibitions of fraud in the sale of securities, later greatly strengthened by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |archive-date=January 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114052905/http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits short-swing profits (from any purchases and sales within any six-month period) made by corporate directors, officers, or stockholders owning more than 10% of a firm's shares. Under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, [[SEC Rule 10b-5]], prohibits fraud related to securities trading.

The Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 and the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 place penalties for illegal insider trading as high as three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided from the illegal trading.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomsen LT|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2006/ts092606lct.htm|title=Testimony Concerning Insider Trading|publisher=SEC|accessdate=December 21, 2011|archive-date=September 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921022213/https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2006/ts092606lct.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

====SEC regulations====
SEC [[Regulation Fair Disclosure|regulation FD ("Fair Disclosure")]] requires that if a company intentionally discloses material non-public information to one person, it must simultaneously disclose that information to the public at large. In the case of an unintentional disclosure of material non-public information to one person, the company must make a public disclosure "promptly."<ref name="Harris"/>{{rp|586}}

Insider trading, or similar practices, are also regulated by the SEC under its rules on takeovers and tender offers under the [[Williams Act]].

===Court decisions===
Much of the development of insider trading law has resulted from court decisions.

In 1909, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in ''Strong v. Repide''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/213/419/ |title=Strong v. Repide – 213 U.S. 419 (1909) :: Justia US Supreme Court Center |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012 |archive-date=January 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107050911/http://supreme.justia.com/us/213/419/ |url-status=live }}</ref> that a director who expects to act in a way that affects the value of shares cannot use that knowledge to acquire shares from those who do not know of the expected action. Even though, in general, ordinary relations between directors and shareholders in a business corporation are not of such a fiduciary nature as to make it the duty of a director to disclose to a shareholder general knowledge regarding the value of the shares of the company before he purchases any from a shareholder, some cases involve special facts that impose such duty.

In 1968, the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] advanced a "level playing field" theory of insider trading in ''[[SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.|SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co]].''<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8550821722818303653 Securities and Exchange Com'n v.

In 1984, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of ''Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=463&invol=646 |title=FindLaw &#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012 |archive-date=May 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520004927/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=463&invol=646 |url-status=live }}</ref> that tippees (receivers of second-hand information) are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper had breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing confidential information. One such example would be if the tipper received any personal benefit from the disclosure, thereby breaching his or her duty of loyalty to the company. In ''Dirks'', the "tippee" received confidential information from an insider, a former employee of a company. The reason the insider disclosed the information to the tippee, and the reason the tippee disclosed the information to third parties, was to blow the whistle on massive fraud at the company. As a result of the tippee's efforts the fraud was uncovered, and the company went into bankruptcy. But, while the tippee had given the "inside" information to clients who made profits from the information, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not be held liable under the federal securities laws—for the simple reason that the insider from whom he received the information was not releasing the information for an improper purpose (a personal benefit), but rather for the purpose of exposing the fraud. The Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not have been aiding and abetting a securities law violation committed by the insider—for the simple reason that no securities law violation had been committed by the insider.

In ''Dirks'', the Supreme Court also defined the concept of "constructive insiders," who are lawyers, investment bankers, and others who receive confidential information from a corporation while providing services to the corporation. Constructive insiders are also liable for insider trading violations if the corporation expects the information to remain confidential, since they acquire the fiduciary duties of the true insider.

The next expansion of insider trading liability came in ''SEC vs. Materia''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://leagle.com/decision/1984942745F2d197_1924.xml/S.E.C.%20v.%20MATERIA |title=S.E.C. V. Materia |publisher=Leagle.com |accessdate=March 3, 2014 |archive-date=January 3, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103000348/http://www.leagle.com/decision/1984942745F2d197_1924.xml/S.E.C. |url-status=live }}</ref> 745 F.2d 197 (2d Cir. 1984), the case that first introduced the misappropriation theory of liability for insider trading. Materia, a financial printing firm proofreader, and clearly not an insider by any definition, was found to have determined the identity of takeover targets based on proofreading tender offer documents in the course of his employment. After a two-week trial, the district court found him liable for insider trading, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed holding that the theft of information from an employer, and the use of that information to purchase or sell securities in another entity, constituted a fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a securities. The misappropriation theory of insider trading was born, and liability further expanded to encompass a larger group of outsiders.

In ''United States v. Carpenter''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=484&invol=19 |title=FindLaw &#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012 |archive-date=September 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907221113/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=484&invol=19 |url-status=live }}</ref> (1986) the U.S. Supreme Court cited an earlier ruling while unanimously upholding mail and wire fraud convictions for a defendant who received his information from a journalist rather than from the company itself. The journalist [[R. Foster Winans]] was also convicted, on the grounds that he had misappropriated information belonging to his employer, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. In that widely publicized case, Winans traded in advance of "Heard on the Street" columns appearing in the Journal.<ref>{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Cox |authorlink=Christopher Cox |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch050106cc.htm |title=Speech by SEC Chairman: Remarks at the Annual Meeting of the Society of American Business Editors and Writers |access-date=2017-09-01 |archive-date=2016-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608143447/http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch050106cc.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Court stated in ''Carpenter'': "It is well established, as a general proposition, that a person who acquires special knowledge or information by virtue of a confidential or fiduciary relationship with another is not free to exploit that knowledge or information for his own personal benefit but must account to his principal for any profits derived therefrom."

However, in upholding the securities fraud (insider trading) convictions, the justices were evenly split.

In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the misappropriation theory of insider trading in ''United States v. O'Hagan'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-842.ZO.html |title=United States v. O'Hagan, 117 S.Ct. 2199, 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=August 20, 2012 |archive-date=January 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107174916/https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-842.ZO.html |url-status=live }}</ref> 521 U.S. 642, 655 (1997). O'Hagan was a partner in a law firm representing [[Diageo|Grand Metropolitan]], while it was considering a tender offer for [[Pillsbury Company]]. O'Hagan used this inside information by buying call options on Pillsbury stock, resulting in profits of over $4.3 million. O'Hagan claimed that neither he nor his firm owed a fiduciary duty to Pillsbury, so he did not commit fraud by purchasing Pillsbury options.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.com/regionals/ca/briefing/wilson/wilson21.html |title=Law.com |publisher=Law.com |date=June 25, 1997 |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |archive-date=November 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104140351/http://www.law.com/regionals/ca/briefing/wilson/wilson21.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Court rejected O'Hagan's arguments and upheld his conviction.

The "misappropriation theory" holds that a person commits fraud "in connection with" a securities transaction and thereby violates 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. Under this theory, a fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a principal's information to purchase or sell securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of the information. In lieu of premising liability on a fiduciary relationship between company insider and purchaser or seller of the company's stock, the misappropriation theory premises liability on a fiduciary-turned-trader's deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.

The Court specifically recognized that a corporation's information is its property: "A company's confidential information ... qualifies as property to which the company has a right of exclusive use. The undisclosed misappropriation of such information in violation of a fiduciary duty ... constitutes fraud akin to embezzlement – the fraudulent appropriation to one's own use of the money or goods entrusted to one's care by another."

In 2000, the SEC enacted [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]], which defined trading "on the basis of" inside information as any time a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. It is no longer a defense for one to say that one would have made the trade anyway. The rule also created an [[affirmative defense]] for pre-planned trades.

In ''[[Chip Skowron|Morgan Stanley v. Skowron]]'', 989 F. Supp. 2d 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), applying New York's [[faithless servant]] doctrine, the court held that a hedge fund's [[portfolio manager]] engaging in insider trading in violation of his company's code of conduct, which also required him to report his misconduct, must repay his employer the full $31 million his employer paid him as compensation during his period of faithlessness.<ref name="auto6">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RaGDwAAQBAJ&q=%22faithless+servant%22&pg=PA472|title=Employment Law: Private Ordering and Its Limitations|first1=Timothy P.|last1=Glynn|first2=Rachel S.|last2=Arnow-Richman|first3=Charles A.|last3=Sullivan|date= 2019|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law & Business|via=Google Books|isbn=9781543801064}}</ref><ref name="auto4">{{cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/faithless-ex-morgan-stanley-fund-manager-ordered-repay-31m-former-employer-1429819|author=Jerin Matthew|title='Faithless' Ex-Morgan Stanley Fund Manager Ordered to Repay $31m to Former Employer|date=December 20, 2013|website=International Business Times UK|access-date=August 6, 2019|archive-date=July 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706143933/https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/faithless-ex-morgan-stanley-fund-manager-ordered-repay-31m-former-employer-1429819|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/the-huge-costs-of-being-a-faithless-servant/|title=The Huge Costs of Being a 'Faithless Servant'|first=Peter J.|last=Henning|date=December 23, 2013|website=New York Times DealBook|access-date=August 6, 2019|archive-date=June 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624175425/https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/the-huge-costs-of-being-a-faithless-servant/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Morgan-Stanley-seeks-10-2-million-from-convicted-4193127.php|title=Morgan Stanley seeks $10.2 million from convicted former trader|date=January 15, 2013|work=GreenwichTime|access-date=August 6, 2019|archive-date=June 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627172218/https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Morgan-Stanley-seeks-10-2-million-from-convicted-4193127.php|url-status=live}}</ref> The court called the insider trading the "ultimate abuse of a portfolio manager's position."<ref name="auto4"/> The judge also wrote: "In addition to exposing Morgan Stanley to government investigations and direct financial losses, Skowron's behavior damaged the firm's reputation, a valuable corporate asset."<ref name="auto4"/>

In 2014, in the case of ''United States v. Newman'', the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cited the Supreme Court's decision in ''Dirks'', and ruled that for a "tippee" (a person who used information they received from an insider) to be guilty of insider trading, the tippee must have been aware not only that the information was insider information, but must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose (such as a personal benefit). The Court concluded that the insider's breach of a fiduciary duty not to release confidential information—in the absence of an improper purpose on the part of the insider—is not enough to impose criminal liability on either the insider or the tippee.<ref name="United States v 2014"/>

In 2016, in the case of ''Salman v. United States'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the benefit a tipper must receive as predicate for an insider-trader prosecution of a tippee need not be pecuniary, and that giving a 'gift' of a tip to a family member is presumptively an act for the personal though intangible benefit of the tipper.<ref name="Savage">{{Cite news|last=Savage |first=David G. |date=6 December 2016 |title=Supreme Court affirms broad reach of insider-trading laws |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-supreme-court-insider-trading-20161206-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207135034/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-supreme-court-insider-trading-20161206-story.html |archive-date=7 December 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>

In May 2007, a bill entitled the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or [[STOCK Act]] was introduced that would hold congressional and federal employees liable for stock trades they made using information they gained through their jobs and also regulate analysts or political intelligence firms that research government activities.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Gross |authorlink=Daniel Gross |title=Insider Trading, Congressional-Style |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2166664/fr/rss/%20slate.com |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=May 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930231755/http://www.slate.com/id/2166664/fr/rss/%20slate.com |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[STOCK Act]] was enacted on April 4, 2012.

==Arguments for legalizing==
Some economists and legal scholars (such as [[Henry Manne]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Thomas Sowell]], [[Daniel Fischel]], and [[Frank H. Easterbrook]]) have argued that laws against insider trading should be repealed. They claim that insider trading based on material nonpublic information benefits investors, in general, by more quickly introducing new information into the market.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-altucher/should-insider-trading-be_b_324409.html |title=James Altucher: Should Insider Trading Be Made Legal? |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 20, 2009 |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |archive-date=December 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230132101/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-altucher/should-insider-trading-be_b_324409.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Friedman, laureate of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], said: "You want more insider trading, not less. You want to give the people most likely to have knowledge about deficiencies of the company an incentive to make the public aware of that." Friedman did not believe that the trader should be required to make his trade known to the public, because the buying or selling pressure itself is information for the market.<ref name="Harris" />{{rp|591–7}}

Other critics argue that insider trading is a victimless act: a willing buyer and a willing seller agree to trade property that the seller rightfully owns, with no prior contract (according to this view) having been made between the parties to refrain from trading if there is [[asymmetric information]]. ''[[The Atlantic]]'' has described the process as "arguably the closest thing that modern finance has to a victimless crime."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/capitol-gains/8692/ |title=Capitol Gains – Magazine |magazine=The Atlantic |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |archive-date=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614135908/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/capitol-gains/8692/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Legalization advocates also question why "trading" where one party has more information than the other is legal in other markets, such as [[real estate]], but not in the stock market. For example, if a [[geology|geologist]] knows there is a high likelihood of the discovery of petroleum under Farmer Smith's land, he may be entitled to make Smith an offer for the land, and buy it, without first telling Farmer Smith of the geological data.<ref>{{Cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 1905 - Disclosure of confidential information generally|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1905|access-date=2020-11-05|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en}}</ref>

Advocates of legalization make [[free speech]] arguments. Punishment for communicating about a development pertinent to the next day's stock price might seem an act of censorship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/information_privilege.pdf |title="Information, Privilege, Opportunity, and Insider Trading" in the Northern Illinois University Law Review |accessdate=January 7, 2013 |archive-date=April 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412164119/http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/information_privilege.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> If the information being conveyed is proprietary information and the corporate insider has contracted to not expose it, he has no more right to communicate it than he would to tell others about the company's confidential new product designs, formulas, or bank account passwords.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Some authors have used these arguments to propose legalizing insider trading on negative information (but not on positive information). Since negative information is often withheld from the market, trading on such information has a higher value for the market than trading on positive information.<ref>Kristoffel Grechenig, The Marginal Incentive of Insider Trading: An Economic Reinterpretation of the Case Law, University of Memphis Law Review 2006, vol. 37,  p. 75-148 [https://ssrn.com/abstract=883642 (link)].</ref><ref>Macey, Jonathan.

There are very limited laws against "insider trading" in the commodities markets if, for no other reason than that the concept of an "insider" is not immediately analogous to commodities themselves (corn, wheat, steel, etc.). However, analogous activities such as [[front running]] are illegal under US commodity and futures trading laws. For example, a [[commodity broker]] can be charged with fraud for receiving  a large purchase order from a client (one likely to affect the price of that commodity) and then purchasing that commodity before executing the client's order to benefit from the anticipated price increase.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

==Commercialisation==
The advent of the Internet has provided a forum for the [[commercialisation]] of trading on insider information. In 2016 a number of [[dark web]] sites were identified as marketplaces where such non-public information was bought and sold. At least one such site used [[bitcoin]]s to avoid currency restrictions and to impede tracking. Such sites also provide a place for soliciting for corporate informants, where non-public information may be used for purposes<ref>Such purposes include [[competitor analysis]] for [[competitive advantage]], providing a basis for [[sabotage]], and gaining advantage in [[Intragroup conflict|internicine feuding]].</ref> other than stock trading.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Uchill |first=Joe |date=1 February 2017 |title=Report: Leakers sell inside trading tips on dark web |newspaper=The Hill |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/317377-report-leakers-sell-inside-trading-tips-on-dark-web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214195423/http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/317377-report-leakers-sell-inside-trading-tips-on-dark-web |archive-date=14 February 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Legal differences among jurisdictions==
The US and the UK vary in the way the law is interpreted and applied with regard to insider trading. In the UK, the relevant laws are the [[Criminal Justice Act 1993]], Part V, Schedule 1; the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]], which defines an offence of "[[Market Abuse]]";<ref>{{cite web|last=Kern |first=Alexander |title=Insider Dealing and Market Abuse: The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 |publisher=Centre for Business Research, University of Cambridge |date=December 2001 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7151265.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215195343/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7151265.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> and the European Union Regulation No 596/2014.<ref>{{cite web | title=Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014R0596 | access-date=15 February 2017 | archive-date=16 February 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216053324/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014R0596 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Market abuse |publisher=Financial Conduct Authority (FCU) |url=https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109173744/https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse |archive-date=9 November 2016 |url-status=live|date=2016-05-04 }}</ref> The principle is that it is illegal to trade on the basis of market-sensitive information that is not generally known.

The [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) paper on the "Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation" (updated to 2003)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD154.pdf |title=Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation |publisher=[[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829080215/http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD154.pdf |archive-date=29 August 2005 |url-status=live}}</ref> states that the three objectives of good securities market regulation are investor protection, ensuring that markets are fair, efficient and transparent, and reducing [[systemic risk]].

The discussion of these "Core Principles" state that "investor protection" in this context means "Investors should be protected from misleading, manipulative or fraudulent practices, including insider trading, front running or trading ahead of customers and the misuse of client assets." More than 85 percent of the world's securities and commodities market regulators are members of IOSCO and have signed on to these Core Principles.

The [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] now use the IOSCO Core Principles in reviewing the financial health of different country's regulatory systems as part of these organization's financial sector assessment program, so laws against insider trading based on non-public information are now expected by the international community. Enforcement of insider trading laws varies widely from country to country, but the vast majority of jurisdictions now outlaw the practice, at least in principle.

Larry Harris claims that differences in the effectiveness with which countries restrict insider trading help to explain the differences in [[executive compensation]] among those countries. The US, for example, has much higher CEO salaries than have Japan or Germany, where insider trading is less effectively restrained.<ref name="Harris"/>{{rp|593}}

==By nation==
===European Union===
In 2014, the European Union (EU) adopted legislation (Criminal Sanctions for Market Abuse Directive) that harmonised criminal sanctions for insider dealing. All EU Member States agreed to introduce maximum prison sentences of at least four years for serious cases of [[market manipulation]] and insider dealing, and at least two years for improper disclosure of insider information.<ref>Hauck, P., [http://www.zis-online.com/dat/artikel/2015_6_930.pdf Europe’s commitment to countering insider dealing and market manipulation on the basis of Art. 83 para. 2 TFEU; A critical evaluation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412164310/http://www.zis-online.com/dat/artikel/2015_6_930.pdf |date=2019-04-12 }}</ref>

===Australia===
The current Australian legislation arose out of the report of a 1989 parliamentary committee report which recommended removal of the requirement that the trader be ‘connected’ with the body corporate.<ref>M Duffy, Insider Trading: Addressing the Continuing Problems of Proof (2009) 23(2) ''Australian Journal of Corporate Law'' 149 https://ssrn.com/abstract=3192201</ref>  This may have weakened the importance of the fiduciary duty rationale and possibly brought new potential offenders within its ambit.  In Australia if a person possesses inside information and knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the information is not generally available and is materially price sensitive then the insider must not trade.  Nor must she or he procure another to trade and must not tip another.  Information will be considered generally available if it consists of readily observable matter or it has been made known to common investors and a reasonable period for it to be disseminated among such investors has elapsed.

Although insider trading in the UK has been illegal since 1980, it proved difficult to successfully prosecute individuals accused of insider trading. There were a number of notorious cases where individuals were able to escape prosecution. Instead the UK regulators relied on a series of fines to punish market abuses.

These fines were widely perceived as an ineffective deterrent (Cole, 2007),<ref>{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Margaret|title=Insider dealing in the City|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2007/0317_mc.shtml|work=Financial Services Authority|accessdate=December 28, 2012|archive-date=February 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205144454/http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2007/0317_mc.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> and there was a statement of intent by the UK regulator (the Financial Services Authority) to use its powers to enforce the legislation (specifically the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]]). Between 2009–2012 the FSA secured 14 convictions in relation to insider dealing.

===China===
The majority of shares in China before 2005 were non-tradeable shares that were not sold on the stock exchange publicly but privately. To make shares more accessible, the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) required the companies to convert the non-tradeable shares into tradeable shares. There was a deadline for companies to convert their shares and the deadline was short, due to this there was a massive amount of exchanges and in the midst of these exchanges many people committed insider trading knowing that the selling of these shares would affect prices. Chinese people did not fear insider trading as much as one may in the United States because there is no possibility of imprisonment. Punishment may include monetary fees or temporary relieving from a position in the company. The Chinese do not view insider trading as a crime worth prison time because generally the person has a clean record and a path of success with references to deter them from being viewed as a criminal. On October 1, 2015, Chinese fund manager [[Xu Xiang]] was arrested due to insider trading.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/top-fund-manager-nabbed-in-china-graft-probe|title=Top fund manager nabbed in China graft probe|date=November 4, 2015|work=[[The Straits Times]]|accessdate=November 23, 2015|archive-date=January 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131746/http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/top-fund-manager-nabbed-in-china-graft-probe|url-status=live}}</ref>

===India===
Insider trading in India is an offense according to Sections 12A, 15G of the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992]]. Insider trading is when one with access to non-public, price-sensitive information about the securities of the company subscribes, buys, sells, or deals, or agrees to do so or counsels another to do so as principal or agent.
