=== ''All the Rebel Women'' (2013) ===
As a supporter of [[Fourth-wave feminism|fourth wave feminist]] movements, Cochrane constructs ''All the Rebel Women'' as a tribute to those who are promoting change.<ref>{{Cite book|title=All the Rebel Women|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|publisher=Guardian Books|year=2013|isbn=9781783560363|location=|pages=}}</ref> In 2013, ''The Guardian'' posted an extract of the short novel and summarizes it as such:<blockquote>"Kira Cochrane's 'All the Rebel Women' collects the voices making up a new [[Fourth-wave feminism|fourth wave of feminism]]. In this exclusive extract, she looks at the role humour has to play in the movement."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2013/dec/16/all-the-rebel-women-guardian-shorts-ebook-extract|title=All the Rebel Women: exclusive Guardian Shorts ebook extract|date=December 16, 2013|website=The Guardian}}</ref></blockquote>

=== ''Modern Women: 52 Pioneers'' (2017) ===
''Modern Women'' is a tribute to women who have paved the way for women's equality today.

== Fourth-wave feminism ==
Cochrane's ''All the Rebel Women'' is solely based on the rise of [[fourth-wave feminism]]: the current era of feminism that is heightened by the use of [[social media]] and strives for [[intersectionality]] in society.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Munro|first=Ealasaid|date=23 August 2013|title=Feminism: A Fourth Wave?|journal=Political Insight|volume=4|issue=2|pages=22–25|doi=10.1111/2041-9066.12021|s2cid=142990260|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/feminism-fourth-wave}}</ref> The fourth wave focuses on supporting movements such as body positivity and [[Sex-positive movement|sex-positivity]], as well as protecting the rights of the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/119524-6-things-to-know-about-4th-wave-feminism|title=6 Things To Know About 4th Wave Feminism|last=Sollee|first=Kristen|date=30 October 2015|website=Bustle}}</ref> Cochrane began her research and reporting of the fourth wave in 2013, upon collecting information for ''All the Rebel Women.''<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|title=The fourth wave of feminism: meet the rebel women|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|date=10 December 2013|website=The Guardian}}</ref> In 2013, Cochrane wrote an article for the Guardian, titled "The fourth wave of feminism: meet the rebel women." Cochrane says:<blockquote>"Welcome to the fourth wave of feminism. What's happening now feels like something new again. It's defined by technology: tools that are allowing women to build a strong, popular, reactive movement online. Just how popular is sometimes slightly startling."</blockquote><blockquote>"As 2013 unfolded, it became impossible to ignore the rumble of feminist campaigners, up and down the country."</blockquote><blockquote>"But bald attempts to silence women only made the movement larger and louder. They convinced those who had never thought about misogyny before that it was clearly still alive, and convinced those who were well aware of it to keep going."<ref name=":2" /></blockquote>
