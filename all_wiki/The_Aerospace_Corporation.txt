==History==
On July 1, 1954, the Western Development Division (WDD) of the United States Air Force was established, under the command of [[Brig. Gen.]] [[Bernard A. Schriever]]. WDD was responsible for the development of the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]. The [[TRW Inc.|Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation]] (RW) was identified as the civilian organization responsible for systems engineering for the ICBM program. Their Space Technology Laboratories (STL) was responsible for all missile tasks. Despite early successes, there was criticism from both government and industry on the role RW played as a system engineer, in particular, that RW held a privileged position with the Air Force. In 1958 RW merged with Thompson Products to become [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] and the Space Technology Laboratories became an independent subsidiary of TRW, but concerns regarding conflicts of interest persisted. In September 1959, [[United States Congress]] issued ''House Report 1121'' which recommended that STL be converted into a non-profit institution.<ref>"The Aerospace Corporation, Its Work 1960-1980", pages 12-17. Library of Congress Catalogue Card No. 80-67774</ref> Congress wanted the establishment of an organization, free from conflict of interest, to aid the Air Force in "applying the full resources of modern science and technology to the problem of achieving those continuing advances in [[ballistic missiles]] and military space systems."<ref name="historytimeline">{{cite web|title=Aerospace History Timeline|url=http://www.aero.org/corporation/historytimeline.html|accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref>

On June 3, 1960, Aerospace was established under the laws of the State of [[California]] as a nonprofit corporation.<ref>Davis Dyer, ''TRW: Pioneering Technology and Innovation Since 1900'' (Harvard Business School Press, 1998), p231</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=V6wuAAAAIAAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&pg=RA2-PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false AIR FORCE BALLISTIC MISSILE MANAGEMENT (Formation of Aerospace Corporation)] H. Rept. 87-324, 1 May 1961, page 15.</ref> On June 25, 1960, at a press conference held at the U.S. Air Force Ballistic Missile Division headquarters in El Segundo, California, [[Lt. Gen.]] Bernard A. Schriever announced the "formation of a new nonprofit organization, The Aerospace Corporation, to serve the Air Force in the scientific and technical planning and management of missile-space programs."<ref>{{cite web|title=Making Space Work Since 1960|url=http://www.aero.org/programs/|accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref>

Among the earliest projects it supported were the [[Dyna-Soar]] [[spaceplane|orbital spaceplane]], [[Project Mercury]], and the man-rating of the [[Atlas (rocket)]] [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]. The Aerospace Corporation provided general systems engineering and technical direction for the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] missile, first tested in 1962, which became the launch vehicle for [[Project Gemini]]. Other notable projects of the 1960s include the advanced ballistic re-entry system (ABRES), the Air Force's [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL), the [[Defense Satellite Communications System]] (DSCS), and the [[Defense Support Program]] (DSP).

During the 1970s, Aerospace began performing advanced space program analysis and program studies for [[NASA]]'s development of the Space Transportation System (STS), more commonly known as the [[space shuttle]]. Aerospace also began tests on airborne UHF terminals for the Air Force Satellite Communications System, AFSATCOM. In the mid-70s Aerospace assumed general systems engineering and integration responsibility for the [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]] (DMSP). Beginning in 1973, a program office was established to assist the Air Force in the creation of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS). In recognition of their GPS collaboration, Aerospace shared the 1992 [[Collier Trophy|Robert J. Collier Trophy]], the nation's highest award for aeronautical achievement, "for the most significant development for safe and efficient navigation and surveillance of air and spacecraft since the introduction of radio navigation 50 years ago."<ref>{{cite web|title=Naval Research Laboratory|url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/content.php?P=COLLIER|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref>

Throughout the 1980s, Aerospace supported the [[Inertial Upper Stage]] (IUS), the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), the [[Milstar]] and [[DSCS]] satellite communication systems, and [[antisatellite]] (ASAT) programs. They provided planning, design, and evaluation for the [[Air Force Satellite Control Network]] (AFSCN) and the Consolidated Space Operations Center at [[Schriever Air Force Base]] in Colorado. During this same time period, the company also provided systems engineering and integration for launch vehicles, including the [[Atlas rocket|Atlas]], [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]], [[Titan IV]], and [[Delta II]].

In the 1990s, Aerospace participated in the planning and development of system requirements for the [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]] (EELV) program, the next generation of launch vehicles. They continued to provide launch vehicle systems engineering for the [[Atlas II]], [[Delta III rocket|Delta III]], and [[Titan IV]]B. Satellite program support included Wideband Gapfiller, Space Based Laser, the Ultrahigh-Frequency Follow-On program, and the Global Broadcast Service. Throughout the second half of the 90s, the corporation conducted independent assessments for the [[International Space Station]], provided technical support for the [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft, and supported the acquisition of the [[Space-Based Infrared System]] (SBIRS) satellite constellation.

Most recently, The Aerospace Corporation provided further technical assistance to EELV programs including the [[Atlas V]] and [[Delta IV rocket|Delta IV]], and supported planning for [[Space-Based Radar|Space Radar]] to provide global persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. Aerospace has been involved in the analysis of concept designs for the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (SSTS). Aerospace plays an integral role in the development of the [[Advanced Extremely High Frequency]] (AEHF) program that will replace the Milstar system. Another system that Aerospace was supporting is the [[Transformational Satellite Communications System]] MILSATCOM architecture to link military and reconnaissance communication networks. However, it was canceled per the recommendations of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates due to DoD budgetary constraints.<ref>http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1341</ref> Aerospace remains a significant partner in the continuing evolution of the GPS system. Aerospace has been playing a leading role in the planning and acquisition of [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]] for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]. In 2005, Aerospace supported the Air Force Affordable Responsive Spacelift (ARES) launch system demonstration program.<ref name="historytimeline"/>

==Capabilities==
The Aerospace Corporation, as the [[FFRDC]] for national security space, primarily supports the [[Space and Missile Systems Center]] of the Air Force Space Command, as well as the [[National Reconnaissance Office]]. Their 50-year history working side by side with these organizations has made Aerospace the national memory and data repository for launch and satellite systems. They provide scientific and engineering support for launch, space, and related ground systems that serve the national interest.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] has identified five core competencies for the Aerospace FFRDC: launch certification, system-of-systems engineering, systems development and acquisition, process implementation, and technology application.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is an FFRDC?|url=http://www.aero.org/corporation/ffrdc.html|accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref>

Aerospace also manages support to programs for [[NASA]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), as well as other civil and some commercial space customers.

The Aerospace Corporation sponsors several annual conferences and workshops including planetary defense, space systems engineering, space power, and [[spacecraft thermal control]].
