'''Fermentation''' is a [[metabolism|metabolic]] process that produces chemical changes in organic [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] through the action of [[enzyme]]s. In [[biochemistry]], it is narrowly defined as the extraction of energy from [[carbohydrate]]s in the absence of [[oxygen]]. [[Fermentation in food processing|In food production]], it may more broadly refer to any process in which the activity of [[microorganism]]s brings about a desirable change to a foodstuff or beverage.<ref name="Hui 2004 p.

==Biological role==
Along with [[photosynthesis]] and [[aerobic respiration]], fermentation is a method to extract energy from molecules.  This method is the only one common to all bacteria and [[eukaryote]]s. It is therefore considered the oldest [[metabolic pathway]], suitable for primeval environments--before plantlife on Earth, that is, before oxygen in the atmosphere.<ref name=Tobin/>{{rp|389}} 

[[Yeast]], a form of [[fungus]], occurs in almost any environment capable of supporting microbes, from the skins of fruits to the guts of insects and mammals to the deep ocean.  Yeasts convert (break down) sugar-rich molecules to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Martini|first1=A.|s2cid=35231385|title=Biodiversity and conservation of yeasts|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation|date=1992|volume=1|issue=4|pages=324–333|doi=10.1007/BF00693768}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bass|first1=D.|last2=Howe|first2=A.|last3=Brown|first3=N.|last4=Barton|first4=H.|last5=Demidova|first5=M.|last6=Michelle|first6=H.|last7=Li|first7=L.|last8=Sanders|first8=H.|last9=Watkinson|first9=S.

Basic mechanisms for fermentation remain present in all cells of higher organisms. [[Mammal]]ian [[muscle]] carries out fermentation during periods of intense exercise where oxygen supply becomes limited, resulting in the creation of [[lactic acid]].<ref name=Voet>{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Donald|last2=Voet|first2=Judith G.|title=Biochemistry|date=2010|publisher=Wiley Global Education|isbn=9781118139936|edition=4th}}</ref>{{rp|63}} In [[invertebrates]], fermentation also produces [[succinate]] and [[alanine]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Broda|first1=E|title=The Evolution of the Bioenergetic Processes|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|date=2014|volume=21|pages=143–208|publisher=Elsevier|pmid=4913287|isbn=9781483136134}}</ref>{{rp|141}}

Fermentative bacteria play an essential role in the production of methane in habitats ranging from the [[rumen]]s of cattle to sewage digesters and freshwater sediments. They produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide, [[formate]] and [[acetate]] and [[carboxylic acid]]s.  Then consortia of microbes convert the carbon dioxide and acetate to methane. Acetogenic bacteria oxidize the acids, obtaining more acetate and either hydrogen or formate. Finally, [[methanogenesis|methanogens]] (in the domain ''[[Archea]]'') convert acetate to methane.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ferry|first1=J G|title=Methane from acetate.|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|date=September 1992|volume=174|issue=17|pages=5489–5495|doi=10.1128/jb.174.17.5489-5495.1992|pmid=1512186|pmc=206491}}</ref>

However, more exotic compounds can be produced by fermentation, such as [[butyric acid]] and [[acetone]].

Fermentation normally occurs in an [[anaerobic environment]]. In the presence of O<sub>2</sub>, NADH, and pyruvate are used to generate ATP in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]]. This is called [[oxidative phosphorylation]].  This generates much more ATP than glycolysis alone.  It releases the chemical energy of O<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 20"/> For this reason, fermentation is rarely used when oxygen is available. However, even in the presence of abundant oxygen, some strains of [[yeast]] such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' prefer fermentation to [[aerobic respiration]] as long as there is an adequate supply of [[Sugar#Chemistry|sugars]] (a phenomenon known as the [[Crabtree effect]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Piškur|first1=Jure|last2=Compagno|first2=Concetta|title=Molecular mechanisms in yeast carbon metabolism|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642550133|page=12}}</ref> Some fermentation processes involve [[obligate anaerobe]]s, which cannot tolerate oxygen.

Although [[yeast]] carries out the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] in the production of [[ethanol]] in [[beer]]s, [[wine]]s, and other alcoholic drinks, this is not the only possible agent: [[bacteria]] carry out the fermentation in the production of [[xanthan gum]].

The figure illustrates the process. Before fermentation, a glucose molecule breaks down into two pyruvate molecules ([[Glycolysis]]). The energy from this [[exothermic reaction]] is used to bind inorganic [[phosphate]]s to ADP, which converts it to ATP, and convert NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. The pyruvates break down into two [[acetaldehyde]] molecules and give off two carbon dioxide molecules as waste products. The acetaldehyde is reduced into ethanol using the energy and hydrogen from NADH, and the NADH is oxidized into NAD<sup>+</sup> so that the cycle may repeat. The reaction is catalyzed by the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase.<ref name="Life 2004. pp. 139-140"/>

===Lactic acid===
{{Main|Lactic acid fermentation}}

''Homolactic fermentation'' (producing only lactic acid) is the simplest type of fermentation. Pyruvate from glycolysis<ref name="Introductory Botany 2007. p. 86">Introductory Botany: plants, people, and the Environment. Berg, Linda R. Cengage Learning, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-534-46669-5}}.  p. 86</ref> undergoes a simple [[redox]] reaction, forming [[lactic acid]].<ref name="AP Biology. Anestis 2006. P. 61">AP Biology. Anestis, Mark. 2nd Edition. McGraw-Hill Professional. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-07-147630-0}}. p. 61</ref><ref name="Volume 3. Thorpe 1922. p.159">A dictionary of applied chemistry, Volume 3. Thorpe, Sir Thomas Edward. Longmans, Green and Co., 1922. p.159</ref> It is probably the only respiration process that does not produce a gas as a byproduct. Overall, one molecule of glucose (or any six-carbon sugar) is converted to two molecules of lactic acid:
:C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> → 2 CH<sub>3</sub>CHOHCOOH
It occurs in the muscles of animals when they need energy faster than the [[blood]] can supply oxygen. It also occurs in some kinds of [[bacterium|bacteria]] (such as [[lactobacilli]]) and some [[fungi]]. It is the type of bacteria that convert [[lactose]] into lactic acid in [[yogurt]], giving it its sour taste. These lactic acid bacteria can carry out either [[homolactic fermentation]], where the end-product is mostly lactic acid, or ''heterolactic fermentation'', where some lactate is further metabolized to ethanol and carbon dioxide<ref name="AP Biology. Anestis 2006. P. 61"/> (via the [[phosphoketolase]] pathway), acetate, or other metabolic products, e.g.:
:C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>CHOHCOOH + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH + CO<sub>2</sub>
If lactose is fermented (as in yogurts and cheeses), it is first converted into glucose and galactose (both six-carbon sugars with the same atomic formula):
:C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
Heterolactic fermentation is in a sense intermediate between [[lactic acid fermentation]] and other types, e.g. [[alcoholic fermentation]]. Reasons to go further and convert lactic acid into something else include:

*The acidity of lactic acid impedes biological processes. This can be beneficial to the fermenting organism as it drives out competitors that are unadapted to the acidity. As a result, the food will have a longer shelf life (one reason foods are purposely fermented in the first place); however, beyond a certain point, the acidity starts affecting the organism that produces it.
*The high concentration of lactic acid (the final product of fermentation) drives the equilibrium backwards ([[Le Chatelier's principle]]), decreasing the rate at which fermentation can occur and slowing down growth.
*Ethanol, into which lactic acid can be easily converted, is volatile and will readily escape, allowing the reaction to proceed easily. [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] is also produced, but it is only weakly acidic and even more volatile than ethanol.
*Acetic acid (another conversion product) is acidic and not as volatile as ethanol; however, in the presence of limited oxygen, its creation from lactic acid releases additional energy. It is a lighter molecule than lactic acid, forming fewer hydrogen bonds with its surroundings (due to having fewer groups that can form such bonds), thus is more volatile and will also allow the reaction to proceed more quickly.
*If [[propionic acid]], [[butyric acid]], and longer monocarboxylic acids are produced (see [[mixed acid fermentation]]), the amount of acidity produced per glucose consumed will decrease, as with ethanol, allowing faster growth.

===Hydrogen gas===
{{Main|Fermentative hydrogen production}}
[[Hydrogen]] gas is produced in many types of fermentation as a way to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup> from NADH. [[Electron]]s are transferred to [[ferredoxin]], which in turn is oxidized by [[hydrogenase]], producing H<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="Life 2004. pp. 139-140"/> Hydrogen gas is a [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[methanogen]]s and [[Sulfate-reducing microorganisms|sulfate reducer]]s, which keep the concentration of hydrogen low and favor the production of such an energy-rich compound,<ref>{{cite book

=== Alternative protein ===
[[File:Impossible Burger - Gott's Roadside- 2018 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|255x255px|Fermentation is used to generate the heme protein found in the Impossible Burger.]]
Fermentation can be applied to generate alternative protein sources. For instance, plant based protein foods such as sauerkraut and kimchi, tofu and tempeh are produced using fermentation. However, fermentation can also be used to [[Cultured meat|culture]] animal products made from non-living material in vitro. Eggs, honey, cheese and milk are all examples which are made of various proteins. These proteins can be produced using  this particular application of fermentation.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

Heme is a protein which gives meat its characteristic texture, flavour and aroma.<ref name="wired">{{Cite news|title=Inside the Strange Science of the Fake Meat That 'Bleeds'|language=en-us|work=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/story/the-impossible-burger/|access-date=2020-10-28|issn=1059-1028|author=Matt Simon|date=2017-09-20}}</ref> Impossible Foods used fermentation to generate a particular strand of heme derived from soybean roots, called soy [[leghemoglobin]], which was integrated into the Impossible Burger to mimic meat flavor and appearance.<ref name=wired/>

===Other===
Other types of fermentation include [[mixed acid fermentation]], [[butanediol fermentation]], [[butyrate fermentation]], [[caproate fermentation]], [[acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation]], and [[glyoxylate fermentation]].

==Modes of operation==
Most industrial fermentation uses batch or fed-batch procedures, although continuous fermentation can be more economical if various challenges, particularly the difficulty of maintaining sterility, can be met.<ref name=Li>{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Teng|last2=Chen|first2=Xiang-bin|last3=Chen|first3=Jin-chun|last4=Wu|first4=Qiong|last5=Chen|first5=Guo-Qiang|title=Open and continuous fermentation: Products, conditions and bioprocess economy|journal=Biotechnology Journal|date=December 2014|volume=9|issue=12|pages=1503–1511|doi=10.1002/biot.201400084|pmid=25476917|s2cid=21524147}}</ref>

===Batch===
In a batch process, all the ingredients are combined and the reactions proceed without any further input. Batch fermentation has been used for millennia to make bread and alcoholic beverages, and it is still a common method, especially when the process is not well understood.<ref name=Cinar>{{cite book|last1=Cinar|first1=Ali|last2=Parulekar|first2=Satish J.|last3=Undey|first3=Cenk|last4=Birol|first4=Gulnur|title=Batch fermentation modeling, monitoring, and control.|date=2003|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York|isbn=9780203911358}}</ref>{{rp|1}} However, it can be expensive because the fermentor must be sterilized using high pressure steam between batches.<ref name=Li/> Strictly speaking, there is often addition of small quantities of chemicals to control the pH or suppress foaming.<ref name=Cinar/>{{rp|25}}

Batch fermentation goes through a series of phases. There is a lag phase in which cells adjust to their environment; then a phase in which exponential growth occurs. Once many of the nutrients have been consumed, the growth slows and becomes non-exponential, but production of ''secondary metabolites'' (including commercially important antibiotics and enzymes) accelerates. This continues through a stationary phase after most of the nutrients have been consumed, and then the cells die.<ref name=Cinar/>{{rp|25}}

===Fed-batch===
{{See also|Fed-batch culture}}
Fed-batch fermentation is a variation of batch fermentation where some of the ingredients are added during the fermentation. This allows greater control over the stages of the process. In particular, production of secondary metabolites can be increased by adding a limited quantity of nutrients during the non-exponential growth phase. Fed-batch operations are often sandwiched between batch operations.<ref name=Cinar/>{{rp|1}}<ref name=Schmid>{{cite book|last1=Schmid|first1=Rolf D.|last2=Schmidt-Dannert|first2=Claudia|title=Biotechnology : an illustrated primer|date=2016|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9783527335152|edition=Second|page=92}}</ref>

===Open===
The high cost of sterilizing the fermentor between batches can be avoided using various open fermentation approaches that are able to resist contamination. One is to use a naturally evolved mixed culture. This is particularly favored in wastewater treatment, since mixed populations can adapt to a wide variety of wastes. [[Thermophile|Thermophilic]] bacteria can produce lactic acid at temperatures of around 50 °Celsius, sufficient to discourage microbial contamination; and ethanol has been produced at a temperature of 70&nbsp;°C. This is just below its boiling point (78&nbsp;°C), making it easy to extract. [[Halophiles|Halophilic]] bacteria can produce bioplastics in hypersaline conditions. Solid-state fermentation adds a small amount of water to a solid substrate; it is widely used in the food industry to produce flavors, enzymes and organic acids.<ref name=Li/>

===Continuous===
In continuous fermentation, substrates are added and final products removed continuously.<ref name=Li/> There are three varieties: [[chemostat]]s, which hold nutrient levels constant; [[turbidostat]]s, which keep cell mass constant; and [[Plug flow reactor model|plug flow reactors]] in which the culture medium flows steadily through a tube while the cells are recycled from the outlet to the inlet.<ref name=Schmid/> If the process works well, there is a steady flow of feed and effluent and the costs of repeatedly setting up a batch are avoided. Also, it can prolong the exponential growth phase and avoid byproducts that inhibit the reactions by continuously removing them. However, it is difficult to maintain a steady state and avoid contamination, and the design tends to be complex.<ref name=Li/> Typically the fermentor must run for over 500 hours to be more economical than batch processors.<ref name=Schmid/>

==History of the use of fermentation==

In 1837, [[Charles Cagniard de la Tour]], [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Friedrich Traugott Kützing]] independently published papers concluding, as a result of microscopic investigations, that yeast is a living organism that reproduces by [[budding]].<ref name=Shurtleff>{{cite web|last1=Shurtleff|first1=William|last2=Aoyagi|first2=Akiko|title=A Brief History of Fermentation, East and West|url=http://www.soyinfocenter.com/HSS/fermentation.php|website=Soyinfo Center|publisher=Soyfoods Center, Lafayette, California|access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=Lengeler>{{cite book|editor-last1=Lengeler|editor-first1=Joseph W.|editor-last2=Drews|editor-first2=Gerhart|editor-last3=Schlegel|editor-first3=Hans Günter|title=Biology of the prokaryotes|date=1999|publisher=Thieme [u.a.]|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9783131084118}}</ref>{{rp|6}} Schwann boiled grape juice to kill the yeast and found that no fermentation would occur until new yeast was added. However, a lot of chemists, including [[Antoine Lavoisier]], continued to view fermentation as a simple chemical reaction and rejected the notion that living organisms could be involved. This was seen as a reversion to [[vitalism]] and was lampooned in an anonymous publication by [[Justus von Liebig]] and [[Friedrich Wöhler]].<ref name=Tobin>{{cite book|last1=Tobin|first1=Allan|last2=Dusheck|first2=Jennie|title=Asking about life|date=2005|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Pacific Grove, Calif.|isbn=9780534406530|edition=3rd}}</ref>{{rp|108–109}}

The turning point came when [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895), during the 1850s and 1860s, repeated Schwann's experiments and showed fermentation is initiated by living organisms in a series of investigations.<ref name="Volume 3.

In 1877, working to improve the French [[brewing industry]], Pasteur published his famous paper on fermentation, "''Etudes sur la Bière''", which was translated into English in 1879 as "Studies on fermentation".<ref>Louis Pasteur (1879) Studies on fermentation: The diseases of beer, their causes, and the means of preventing them. Macmillan Publishers.</ref> He defined fermentation (incorrectly) as "Life without air",<ref name="Modern History Sourcebook 1895">Modern History Sourcebook: Louis Pasteur (1822–1895): Physiological theory of fermentation, 1879. Translated by F. Faulkner, D.C. Robb.</ref> yet he correctly showed how specific types of microorganisms cause specific types of fermentations and specific end-products.

Although showing fermentation resulted from the action of living microorganisms was a breakthrough, it did not explain the basic nature of fermentation; nor, prove it is caused by microorganisms which appear to be always present. Many scientists, including Pasteur, had unsuccessfully attempted to extract the fermentation [[enzyme]] from [[yeast]].<ref name="Modern History Sourcebook 1895"/> 

Success came in 1897 when the German chemist [[Eduard Buechner]] ground up yeast, extracted a juice from them, then found to his amazement this "dead" liquid would ferment a sugar solution, forming carbon dioxide and alcohol much like living yeasts.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HFrBP8S7my4C&pg=PA25 New beer in an old bottle]: Eduard Buchner and the Growth of Biochemical Knowledge. [[Cornish-Bowden, Athel]]. Universitat de Valencia. 1997. {{ISBN|978-84-370-3328-0}}. p. 25.</ref> 

Buechner's results are considered to mark the birth of biochemistry. The "unorganized ferments" behaved just like the organized ones. From that time on, the term enzyme came to be applied to all ferments. It was then understood fermentation is caused by enzymes produced by microorganisms.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/enigmaoffermentf0000lage/page/7 The enigma of ferment: from the philosopher's stone to the first biochemical Nobel prize].

Advances in microbiology and fermentation technology have continued steadily up until the present. For example, in the 1930s, it was discovered microorganisms could be [[mutation|mutated]] with physical and chemical treatments to be higher-yielding, faster-growing, tolerant of less oxygen, and able to use a more concentrated medium.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steinkraus |first1=Keith |title=Handbook of Indigenous Fermented Foods |date=2018 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781351442510 |edition=Second}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=H.

==Etymology==
The word "ferment" is derived from the Latin verb ''fervere'', which means to boil. It is thought to have been first used in the late 14th century in [[alchemy]], but only in a broad sense. It was not used in the modern scientific sense until around 1600.
