'''World Kindness Day''' is an [[list of minor secular observances#November|international observance]] on [[13 November]].  It was introduced in 1998 by the World Kindness Movement, a coalition of nations' kindness [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. It is observed in many countries, including [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Nigeria]] and [[United Arab Emirates|the United Arab Emirates]]. [[Singapore]] observed the day for the first time in 2009. [[Italy]] and [[India]] also observed the day. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is fronted by [[David Jamilly]], who co-founded [[Kindness Day UK]] with [[Louise Burfitt-Dons]]. 

In 2010, at the request of Michael Lloyd-White, the [[New South Wales|NSW]] Federation Parents and Citizens Association wrote to the Minister of The NSW Department of Education to place World Kindness Day on the NSW School Calendar. 

In 2012, at the request of the Chairman of World Kindness Australia, World Kindness Day was placed on the Federal School Calendar and the then Minister of School Education, Early Childhood, and Youth. The Hon [[Peter Garrett]] provided a Declaration of Support for World Kindness Australia and placed World Kindness Day on the National School Calendar for over 9000 schools. Schools across the globe are now celebrating World Kindness Day and work with local NGOs such as the Be Kind People Project and [[Life Vest Inside]] In the USA. In 2012 in Australia, [[Marie Bashir]], Governor of NSW, hosted an event for the first time at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] to celebrate World Kindness Day and accepted a Cool To Be Kind Award from year 3 & 4 students. Australian Councils representing over 1.3 million residents have also signed Declarations of Support for World Kindness Australia placing World Kindness Day on the Council Calendar of Events. Events include THE BIG HUG, handing out Kindness Cards, Global Flashmob, which was coordinated by [[Orly Wahba]] from USA which was held in 15 countries and 33 cities with its images of the event making the big screens in [[New York City]]. [[Canada]] celebrates with The Kindness Concert and in Singapore in 2009, 45,000 yellow [[flower]]s were given away. In 2017 World Kindness day was also celebrated in [[Slovenia]], organised by volunteering organisation [[Humanitarƒçek]] as part of their project Randomised Kindness.

==Objective==
World Kindness Day is to highlight good deeds in the community focusing on the positive power and the common thread of [[kindness for good]] which binds us. Kindness is a fundamental part of the [[human condition]] which bridges the divides of race, religion, politics, gender and zip codes. Kindness Cards are also an ongoing activity which can either be passed on to recognize an act of kindness and or ask that an act of kindness be done. Approaches are being made to the [[United Nations]] by the peak global body, the World Kindness Movement, to have World Kindness Day officially recognized and its members unanimously sign a Declaration of Support for World Kindness.

According to [[Gulf News]], "it is a day that encourages individuals to overlook boundaries, race and religion."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/gulf-news-readers-celebrate-world-kindness-day-1.526824|title=Gulf News readers celebrate World Kindness Day|last=Al Theeb|first=Alia|date=November 13, 2009|work=Gulf News|access-date=}}</ref>
