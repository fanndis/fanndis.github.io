'''Swing dance'''  is a group of dances that developed with the [[swing music|swing]] style of [[jazz]] music in the 1920s–1940s, with the origins of each dance predating the popular "[[swing era]]". Hundreds of styles of swing dancing were developed; those that have survived beyond that era include [[Lindy Hop]], [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]], [[Collegiate shag|Collegiate Shag]], and [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anchorsteps.com/lindy.htm|title=What is Lindy Hop?}}</ref><ref name=rebirth>''The Rebirth of Shag''. Dir. Ryan Martin. ''Vimeo''. 2014 <http://vimeo.com/88253085>.</ref> Today, the best-known of these dances is the Lindy Hop,  which originated in [[Harlem]] in the early 1930s.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is swing dancing? |url=http://studio88swingen.com/dance-styles |access-date=October 7, 2016}}</ref>  While the majority of swing dances began in [[African Americans|African American]] communities as [[vernacular dance|vernacular]] [[African American dance]]s, some influenced swing-era dances, like Balboa, developed outside of these communities.

"Swing dance" was not commonly used to identify a group of dances until the latter half of the 20th century. Historically, the term "Swing" referred to the style of jazz music, which inspired the evolution of the dance. [[Jitterbug]] is any form of swing dance, though it is often used as a synonym for the six-count derivative of Lindy Hop called "East Coast Swing".<ref>{{cite web |title= The Jitterbug |url=http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3jtrbg.htm |access-date=October 7, 2016}}</ref>  It was also common to use the word to identify a kind of dancer (i.e., a ''swing dancer'').  A "jitterbug" might prefer to dance Lindy Hop, Shag, or any of the other swing dances.  The term was famously associated with swing era band leader [[Cab Calloway]] because, as he put it, "[The dancers] look like a bunch of jitterbugs out there on the floor due to their fast, often bouncy movements."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Christine Zona|first1=Chris George|title=Gotta Ballroom|date=2008|publisher=Human Kinetics, Inc.|location=United States|isbn=9780736059077|pages=13–214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=42gtx61V0KgC&q=%22They%20look%20like%20a%20bunch%20of%20jitterbugs%20out%20there%20on%20the%20floor%22&pg=PA12|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

The term "swing dancing" is often extended to include other dances that do not have certain characteristics of traditional swing dances: [[West Coast Swing]], [[Carolina Shag]], [[East Coast Swing]], [[Hand dancing|Hand Dancing]], [[Jive (dance)|Jive]], [[Rock and Roll (dance)|Rock and Roll]], [[Modern Jive]], and other dances developed during the 1940s and later.  A strong tradition of social and competitive [[Boogie-woogie (dance)|boogie woogie]] and Rock 'n' Roll in Europe add these dances to their local swing dance cultures.<ref>{{cite web|last1=The Beautiful Times|title=Swing dance|url=https://thebeautifultimes.wordpress.com/the-swing-era/swing-dance/|website=The Beautiful Times|publisher=wordpress|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

==Original forms dating from the 1920s and early 1930s==

* [[Lindy Hop]] evolved in the early 1930s.<ref name="Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop">{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=Frankie|title=Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop|date=2007|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781592135639|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPdDLXYWWaUC&q=international%20encyclopedia%20of%20dance%20swing&pg=PA46|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> It is a dance of African American origin characterized by a high degree of physical vigor.<ref>Spring, Howard.

Because Charles Lindbergh had just made his famous solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean, Shorty George is said to have replied, "the Lindy Hop." Whether it was Shorty George who coined the name is disputed by some writers, but, in any case, the name stuck.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pritchett|first1=Judy|title="Shorty" George Snowden|url=http://www.savoystyle.com/shorty_george.html|website=www.savoystyle.com|publisher=1995-2006|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> The [[Savoy Ballroom]] in Harlem was the home of the Lindy Hop. As its popularity increased, professional troupes were formed. These troupes toured the United States and Europe performing versions of the Lindy Hop.<ref>Spring, Howard. Swing and the Lindy Hop: Dance, Venue, Media, and Tradition. Vol. 15. University of Illinois Press, 1997. 183-207.</ref>
* [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]], also known as "Bal" is an eight-count dance that's done in closed position. The earliest form of the dance (often called "Pure Balboa") evolved in the mostly conservative dance halls of southern California where space was limited and strict codes of conduct were enforced.  These dance halls usually prohibited the wild kicks of the Charleston and Lindy Hop.  Pure Balboa is characterized by an upright posture with partners standing chest to chest.  There are no spins or turns and the dancers remain in contact through the upper chest at all times. Not leaving much scope for variations, pure Balboa is an intrinsically very simple dance. The few step variations generally play with the rhythm or look and feel (style) from below the knee downwards and deal with changes in direction. Balboa is frequently danced to fast [[jazz]] (usually anything from 180 to 320&nbsp;BPM [[beats per minute]] ), though many like a slower (170-190&nbsp;BPM) [[Tempo|tempi]]. While most dancers differentiate between pure Balboa and [[Bal Swing]], both are considered to be a part of the dance. Bal Swing evolved from Balboa when original Balboa dancers experimented with fancier variations of the dance which forced the chest to chest connection to be broken. In this form of Bal a variety of spins, turns, dips, tricks, and even air steps are introduced. These improvisations are permissible provided the overall style and framework remain true in spirit to the original dance and are combined with original Balboa footwork.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guest|first1=Dan|title=Balboa History|url=http://www.lindycircle.com/history/balboa/|website=www.lindycircle.com|publisher=10/17/2005|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>
* [[Collegiate Shag]] (or "Shag") is done primarily to uptempo swing and sometimes pre-swing jazz music (185-200+ [[beats per minute]]). It is believed that the dance originated in the Carolinas in the 1920s,<ref name=rebirth/><ref>“Shag Latest Dance” ''Blytheville Courier News'' (Arkansas) 25 July 1929: 5 [Research credit: Forrest Outman]</ref> later spreading across the United States during the 1930s.  The shag is still danced today by swing dance enthusiasts worldwide. Shag is believed to have been the first and most popular swing dance of the original swing era<ref name=rebirth/>
* [[Lindy Charleston]] is very similar to the original Charleston of the 1920s, only the pulse of the dance is lowered (the up-and-down motion in the pulse emphasizes the downward movement) to match that of the Lindy Hop.  This form of Charleston includes a number of positions, including side-by-side, hand-to-hand, and tandem.  In "jockey position", the closed position is opened out so that both partners may face forward, without breaking apart.  In side-by-side Charleston, partners open the closed position entirely, so that their only points of connection are at their touching hips and arm contact, wherein the leader's right hand and arm touch the follower's back and the follower's left hand and arm touch the leader's shoulder and arm.  Both partners then swing their free arms as they would in solo Charleston. In both jockey and side-by-side Charleston, the leader steps back onto his left foot, while the follower steps back onto her right. In tandem Charleston, one partner stands in front of the other (usually the follower, though the arrangement may vary), both face in the same direction to start, and both begin by stepping back onto the left foot.  The partner behind holds the front partner's handseight, and their joined arms swing backwards and forwards, as in the basic step.

==Forms dating from the late 1930s and early 1940s==

*[[St. Louis shag]] (or "Shag") is a dance that evolved out of the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]].<ref>{{cite web
 | title = St. Louis Shag
 | publisher = StreetSwing.com
 | url = http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3shagst.htm
 | accessdate = 2008-09-28}}</ref> As its name suggests, it is recognized as having started in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri. St. Louis Shag features a stationary 8-count basic that is most commonly composed of triple-step, kick, triple-step, kick. It is a very fast closed position dance that is usually done to [[Stomp (music)|stomp]], [[Jump (music)|jump]], and [[Boogie-woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]] music.

* [[Big Apple (dance)|Big Apple]] is both a partner dance and a "called" circle dance that originated in the Afro-American community of the United States in the beginning of the 20th century.  The dance that eventually became known as the Big Apple is speculated to have been created in the early 1930s by African-American youth dancing at the Big Apple Club, which was at the former [[House of Peace Synagogue]] on Park Street in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].<ref name="wilkinson">{{Harvnb|Wilkinson|2003b}}</ref>  The synagogue was converted into a black [[juke joint]] called the "Big Apple Night Club".<ref name="wilkinson" /><ref name="danguest">{{Harvnb|Guest}}</ref><ref name="barrett">{{Harvnb|Barrett}}</ref><ref name="jitterbuzz">{{Harvnb|Jitterbuzz}}</ref>
* [[Little Apple (dance)|Little Apple]] This dance was a partnered version of the Big Apple, which is also believed to have originated in the Carolinas of the Southern United States.<ref name=rebirth/>

==Derivatives of swing dance from the 1940s and 1950s==

* [[East Coast Swing]] is a simpler 6-count variation that spawned from the six-count variations of the Lindy Hop.  It evolved with swing-band music of the 1940s and the work of the [[Arthur Murray]] dance studios in the 1940s.<ref name = "caknsw">{{cite web|url=http://www.centralhome.com/ballroomcountry/swing.htm|title=Swing History origins of Swing Dance|year=1996|accessdate=2008-03-22}}</ref> It is also known as Six-count Swing, Triple-Step Swing, or Single-Time Swing.  East Coast Swing has very simple structure and footwork along with basic moves and styling. It is popular for its simple nature and is often danced to slow, medium, or fast tempo [[jazz]], blues, or rock and roll.  Occasionally, Rockabilly, aka Rock-a-billy, is mistaken for East Coast Swing, but Rockabilly is more closely related to Western Swing.
* [[West Coast Swing]] was developed in the 1940s, as a stylistic variation on the Los Angeles style of the Lindy Hop. It is a slotted dance and is done to a wide variety of music including: [[blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[Country music|country western]], pop, hip hop, [[smooth jazz|smooth]], [[cool jazz]], R& B, and funk music.<ref name="zzounds.com">"The History of Swing Dancing at ZZounds."

West-coast-swing communities are growing in Australia, [[Brazil]], France, [[India]], [[New Zealand]], [[Ukraine]], [[Romania]], the United Kingdom, and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web |title=World Swing Dance Council Member Registry Events Page |url=http://www.swingdancecouncil.com/ActiveServerPages/UpcomingEvents.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130175317/http://www.swingdancecouncil.com/ActiveServerPages/UpcomingEvents.asp |archive-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2016}}
* [[Western Swing]] has long been the name for jazz-influenced western music of the 1940s and, by extension, two-step, line dancing or swing dance done to such music. Contemporary 21st century [[Country Swing]]  or dancing or "Country Western Swing Dancing"  (C/W Swing) has a distinct culture, with classes and instructional videos on YouTube and DVD teaching dips, lifts, aerials and flips. It adds variations from other country dances, swing styles, salsa and more. As the name suggests, it is most often danced to [[Country music|country and western music]].
* [[Boogie-woogie (dance)|Boogie-woogie]] developed originally in the 1940s, with the rise of [[boogie woogie]] music. It is popular today in Europe, and was considered by some to be the European counterpart to East Coast Swing, a 6-count dance standardized for the American ballroom industry. It is danced to rock music of various kinds, blues or boogie woogie music but usually not to jazz. As the dance has developed, it has also taken to 8-count variations and swing outs similar to Lindy Hop, while keeping the original boogie woogie footwork.
* [[Carolina Shag]] was danced along the strands between Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina, during the 1940s but, during the 1990s and later, has expanded to many other places. It is most often associated with [[beach music]], which refers to songs that are rhythm-and-blues-based and, according to [[Bo Bryan]], a noted shag historian and resident of Beaufort County, is a term that was coined at [[Carolina Beach]], North Carolina.
* [[Imperial Swing]] is a cross between East Coast and West Coast Swing as it is done in slot and in the round. It started at the [[George Edick's Club Imperial|Club Imperial]] in St Louis. George Edick, who owned the club, let teenagers dance on the lower level and the swing dancers of the time taught them what was learned from their trips to the east coast. As people traveled around, they added parts of west coast, bop and Carolina shag to complement the dance and make it distinctive. "The Imperial" has elements of "East Coast", "West Coast", "Carolina Shag" and "Bop".<ref>{{cite web |title=ImperialSwing.com |url=http://www.imperialswing.com/ |access-date=October 7, 2016}}</ref>
* [[Jive (dance)|Jive]] is a dance of International Style Ballroom dancing. It is a very upbeat dance in which the performers look to be hopping off the ground. It initially was based on Eastern swing taken to England by American Troops in World War II and evolved before becoming the now standardized form of today.
* [[Skip jive|Skip Jive]] is a British variant of the Jive, popular in the 1950s and 1960s, danced to [[trad jazz]].
* [[Modern Jive]] (also known as [[LeRoc]] and [[Ceroc]]©) developed in the 1980s, reputedly from a French form of Jive.  Modern Jive is not technically of the Jive family, which typically use a 6-count pattern of various combinations of walking and triple steps (Ballroom Jive - back/replace triple-triple; Swing Jive - triple-triple back/replace), etc.  It is pared down to a simple box step and concentrates on the simpler forms of couple dance styling, gauged to provide a social atmosphere rather than technical aptitude. There are debates about whether it is a form of swing dancing due to lack of syncopations, rhythmic footwork variations, a static partner dynamic, and lack of swinging music, amongst the swing community at large, but they do consider themselves a style of swing.
* [[Rock and Roll (dance)|Rock and Roll]] - Developing in the 1950s in response to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]], rock-and-roll is very popular in Australia and danced socially as well as competitively and in performances. The style has a long association with Lindy Hop in that country, as many of the earliest Lindy Hoppers in the early 1990s moved to Lindy Hop from a rock-and-roll tradition. There are ongoing debates about whether rock-and-roll constitutes swing dancing, particularly in reference to the music to which it is danced: there is some debate as to whether or not it [[Swung note|swings]]. 
* [[Acrobatic Rock'n'Roll]] – Popular in Europe, acrobatic rock'n'roll is popularly associated with Russian gymnasts who took up the dance, though it is popular throughout Europe today. It is a performance dance and sport rather than a social dance, though there are people who remove the acrobatic stunts to dance it on a social level.
* [[Hand dancing|Washington Hand Dancing]] originated around Washington, DC in the mid-1950s,  and a new generation of dancers started innovating and dancing to Motown music. From its very beginning, DC Hand-dance was referred to and called “DC Hand-Dance/Hand-Dancing”, “DC Swing”, “DC Style” (swing) and “fast dance” (meaning DC Hand-Dance).  This is the first time a version of “swing” dance was termed “hand-dance/hand-dancing”.  DC Hand-Dance is characterized by very smooth footwork and movements, and close-in and intricate hand-turns, danced to a 6-beat, 6-count dance rhythm.  The more modern footwork consists of smooth and continuous floor contact, sliding and gliding-type steps versus hopping and jumping-type steps of the older style which stylistically still held elements of its Jitterbug/Lindy Hop roots, and there are no aerials.
* [[Push (dance)|Push]] and [[Whip (dance)|Whip]] are [[Texas]] forms of swing dance developed in the 1940s and 1950s.  They are slotted swing dances, danced to a wide variety of music including blues, pop, jazz, and rock and roll.  Similar to West Coast Swing, they emphasize the closed position, double resistance/rock step, and lead-follow and also incorporate intricate arm work.  Slow Whip is a variation on Whip/Push that is danced to slow blues music, typically 60&nbsp;BPM or slower.

==Swing dancing today==

Swing dancing was most popular in the 1930s and 1940s, but it still continues today. Dance moves have evolved with the music. Swing dancing styles are the foundation of many other dance styles including disco, country line dancing, and hip hop.  Swing dancing clubs and contests are still held around the world.<ref name="zzounds.com"/>

==Competition, social dancing and music==

===Competition===
Traditionally, distinctions are made between "Ballroom Swing" and "Jazz Dance Swing" styles. East Coast Swing is a standardized dance in "American Style" [[Ballroom dancing]], while Jive is a standardized dance in "International Style"; however both of these fall under the "Ballroom Swing" umbrella.

Jazz Dance forms (evolved in dance halls) versus ballroom forms (created for ballroom competition format) are different in appearance.  Jazz Dance forms include Lindy Hop, [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]], [[Collegiate Shag]], and [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]].
{{original research|section|date= May 2010}}

====Types of competition====

Dance competitions specify which forms are to be judged, and are generally available in four different formats:

# Strictly:  One couple competing together in various heats, to randomly selected music, where no pre-choreographed steps are allowed.
# [[Jack and Jill (dance)|Jack and Jill]]:  Where leaders and followers are randomly matched for the competition.  In initial rounds, leaders and followers usually compete individually, but in final rounds, scoring depends on the ability of the partner you draw and your ability to work with that partner.  Some competitions hold a Jill-and-Jack division where leaders must be women and followers must be men.
# Showcase:  One couple competing together for a single song which has been previously choreographed.
# Classic:  Similar to Showcase but with restrictions on lifts, drops, moves where one partner supports the weight of the other partner, and moves where the partners are not in physical contact.

====Levels====
In West Coast Swing the competitions are divided into sections by level of experience.
The levels are Newcomer, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced and All-Star. There is no official system in the United States to ensure that couples dance at the appropriate level of experience. The World Swing Dance Council holds a [https://www.worldsdc.com/registry-points/ Registry] of all points attained at different levels of competition<ref>WSDC Points Registry Rules - World Swing Dance Council, March 2019. https://www.worldsdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019.1A-WSDC-Points-Registry-Rules_Final.pdf</ref>, however not all competitions qualify as "Registry Points Events". 


There is no points system for the majority of Lindy Hop competitions.<ref>"Competition Rules." - Swing Dance America. Accessed April 10, 2015. http://www.swingdanceamerica.com/competition-rules.html.</ref>

====Judging criteria====

Swing dancing falls under the American Rhythm category. There are several different categories at competitions depending on what type of dance you do.<ref name="usadance.org">"DanceSport - Competition Guides - For the Competitor - USADance.org." DanceSport - Competition Guides - For the Competitor - USADance.org. Accessed April 10, 2015. http://usadance.org/dancesport/competition-guides/for-the-competitor/.</ref> Each form of Swing Dance, and each organization within those forms, will have various rules, but those most often used are pulled and adapted from Ballroom usage.

Judging for competition is based on the three "T's" (''below'') as well as showmanship<ref name = "swungover">{{cite web|url=http://swungover.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/on-judging-part-3-swing-judging-philosophy-101/|title=On Judging, Part 3: Swing Judging Philosophy 101|year=2012|accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref> (unless the contest in question designates the audience as the deciding factor).
The three "T's" consist of:
# Timing - Related to tempo & rhythm of the music.
# Teamwork - How well a leader and follower dance together and lead/follow dance variations.
# Technique - How cleanly and precisely the cooperative dancing is executed.

Showmanship consists of presentation, creativity, costumes, and difficulty.

Lindy Hop's most prestigious events have never used these criteria, usually having the simple judging value as who was the best/most-impressive Lindy Hop couple. The Harvest Moon Ball competition in New York City, The American Vernacular Jazz Institute's Hellzapoppin' Competition, and the Ultimate Lindy Hop Showdown all fall into this category.

====Heats====
Most competition dance floors can only hold about 12 couples dancing at a time. If the number of participants is larger than what the floor can hold, the competition will hold qualifying rounds. Once they get to 24 couples there will then be the quarterfinal round (2 separate rounds of about 12 each), then the semifinal (1 round of about 12), and finally the final round (1 round, usually 6 or 7 couples).<ref name="usadance.org"/>

====Team formations====

Additionally a "Team Formation" division may also be specified at a competition.  Under this category, a minimum of 3 to 5 couples (depending on individual competition rules) perform a pre-choreographed routine to a song of their choosing, where the group dances in [[synchronization]] and into different formations.  This division is also judged using the three "T's" and showmanship; however the criteria now apply to the team as a whole.

===Social swing dancing===

Many, if not most, of the swing dances listed above are popular as [[social dance]]s, with vibrant local communities that hold dances with DJs and live bands that play music most appropriate for the preferred dance style. There are frequently active local clubs and associations, classes with independent or studio-/school-affiliated teachers and workshops with visiting or local teachers. Most of these dance styles — as with many other styles — also feature special events, such as camps or [[Lindy exchange]]s.

===Music===

The historical development of particular swing dance styles was often in response to trends in popular music. For example, 1920s and solo Charleston was – and is – usually danced to {{music|time|2|4}} [[ragtime]] music or traditional jazz, Lindy Hop was danced to [[Swing (genre)|swing music]] (a kind of swinging [[jazz]]), and Lindy Charleston to either traditional or swing jazz.  West Coast Swing is usually danced to Pop, R&B, Blues, or Funk.  Western Swing and Push/Whip are usually danced to [[country and western]] or [[Blues]] music.  There are local variations on these musical associations in each dance scene, often informed by local DJs, dance teachers and bands.

Modern swing dance bands active in the U.S. during the 1990s and 2000s include many contemporary jazz [[big bands]], swing revival bands with a national presence such as Lavay Smith and Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers (based in San Francisco), and local/regional jazz bands that specialize in 1930s-1940s swing/Lindy dance music, such as [[The Swingout Big Band]], [[White Heat Swing Orchestra]], and [[Beantown Swing Orchestra]] (Boston), [[The Boilermaker Jazz Band]] (Pittsburgh), the [[Tony Balluff|Southside Aces]] (Minneapolis), Gordon Webster Septet (New York), Jonathan Stout and His Campus Five (Los Angeles) and The Jonathan Stout Orchestra featuring Hilary Alexander (Los Angeles), The Flat Cats (Chicago), [[Glenn Crytzer]] and his Syncopators (Seattle), the Solomon Douglas Swingtet (Seattle), The Gina Knight Orchestra (Chicago and Joliet, IL), the [[Solomon Douglas Swingtet]] and the [[Tom Cunningham Orchestra]] (Washington, D.C.), Sonoran Swing (Arizona), and [[The Bill Elliott Swing Orchestra]] (Los Angeles).
