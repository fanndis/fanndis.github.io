'''Professor''' (commonly abbreviated as '''Prof.'''<ref name="etymonline.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=professor |title=Professor |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2007-07-28 |last=Harper |first=Douglas}}</ref>) is an [[Academy|academic]] rank at [[university|universities]] and other [[post-secondary education]] and research institutions in most countries. Literally, ''professor'' derives from [[Latin]] as a "person who professes". Professors are usually [[expert]]s in their field and teachers of the highest rank.<ref name="etymonline.com"/>

In most systems of [[List of academic ranks|academic ranks]], "professor" as an unqualified title refers only to the most senior academic position, sometimes informally known as "full professor."<ref name="macleans.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/assistant-associate-what-the-words-before-professor-mean/|last=Pettigrew|first=Todd|date=2011-06-17|title=Assistant?

However, the unqualified title "Professor" designated with a capital letter nearly always refers to a full professor.

Professors often conduct [[original research]] and commonly teach [[undergraduate]], [[Professional school|professional]], or [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] courses in their fields of expertise.  In universities with [[graduate school]]s, professors may mentor and supervise graduate students conducting research for a [[thesis|thesis or dissertation]].  In many universities, full professors take on senior managerial roles such as leading departments, research teams and institutes, and filling roles such as [[University president|president]], principal or [[vice-chancellor]].<ref name="prom">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/promoted-from-doctor-to-professor-what-changes|title=Promoted from doctor to professor: what changes?|date=14 November 2016|work=Times Higher Education|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref> The role of professor may be more public-facing than that of more junior staff, and professors are expected to be national or international leaders in their field of expertise.<ref name="prom"/>

==Etymology==
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Ancient Greek philosopher [[Socrates]] was one of the earliest recorded professors.<ref>David K. Knox "Socrates: The First Professor" ''Innovative Higher Education'' December 1998, Volume 23, Issue 2, pp 115â€“126</ref>]]
The term "professor" was first used in the late 14th century to mean "one who teaches a branch of knowledge".<ref name="etymonline.com"/> The word comes "...from Old French professeur (14c.) and directly from [the] Latin professor[, for] 'person who professes to be an expert in some art or science; teacher of highest rank'"; the Latin term came from the "...[[agent noun]] from [[wikt:profiteri|profiteri]] 'lay claim to, declare openly'." As a title that is "prefixed to a name, it dates from 1706". The "[s]hort form prof is recorded from 1838". The term "professor" is also used with a different meaning: "[o]ne professing religion. This canting use of the word comes down from the Elizabethan period, but is obsolete in England."<ref name="etymonline.com"/>

==Description==
A professor is an accomplished and recognized academic. In most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, as well as northern Europe, the title ''professor'' is the highest academic rank at a university. In the [[Professors in the United States|United States]] and [[Academic ranks in Canada#Professorship|Canada]], the title of ''professor'' applies to most post-doctoral academics, so a larger percentage are thus designated.  In these areas, professors are scholars with doctorate degrees (typically [[PhD]] degrees) or equivalent qualifications who teach in four-year colleges and [[University|universities]].  An [[emeritus]] professor is a title given to selected retired professors with whom the university wishes to continue to be associated due to their stature and ongoing research.  Emeritus professors do not receive a salary, but they are often given office or lab space, and use of libraries, labs, and so on.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The term professor is also used in the titles ''[[assistant professor]]'' and ''[[associate professor]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/associate+professor |title=Associate Professor - definition of associate professor by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> which are not considered professor-level positions in all European countries.  In Australia, the title ''associate professor'' is used in place of the term [[Reader (academic rank)|''reader'']] as used in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries; ranking above senior lecturer and below full professor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Australia.aspx|title=Australia, Academic Career Structure|publisher=European University Institute|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>

Beyond holding the proper academic title, universities in many countries also give notable artists, athletes and foreign dignitaries the title ''[[Honorary title (academic)|honorary]] professor'', even if these persons do not have the academic qualifications typically necessary for professorship and they do not take up professorial duties.  However, such "professors" usually do not undertake academic work for the granting institution.  In general, the title of professor is strictly used for academic positions rather than for those holding it on honorary basis.

==Tasks==
[[File:Toni Morrison 2008-2.jpg|thumb|[[Toni Morrison]], Emeritus Professor at [[Princeton University]].]]
Professors are qualified experts in their field who generally perform some or all the following tasks:
* Managing [[teaching]], research, and publications in their departments (in countries where a professor is head of a department);
* Presenting [[lecture]]s and [[seminar]]s in their specialties (i.e., they "[[wikt:profess|profess]]");
* Performing, leading and publishing advanced [[original research]] in [[peer review]]ed [[Peer-reviewed journal|journals]] in their fields;
* Providing [[community service]], including consulting functions (such as advising government and nonprofit organizations) or providing expert commentary on TV or radio news or public affairs programs;
* Mentoring [[graduate students]] in their academic training;
* Mentoring more junior academic staff;
* Conducting administrative or managerial functions, usually at a high level (e.g. deans, heads of departments, research centers, etc.); and
* Assessing students in their fields of expertise (e.g., through grading [[Test (assessment)|examinations]] or [[Thesis#Thesis examinations|viva voce]] defenses).
Other roles of professorial tasks depend on the institution, its legacy, protocols, place (country), and time.  For example, professors at research-oriented universities in North America and, generally, at European universities, are promoted primarily on the basis of research achievements and external grant-raising success.

==Around the world==

Many [[colleges]] and [[university|universities]] and other institutions of [[higher education|higher learning]] throughout the world follow a similar hierarchical ranking structure amongst [[scholars]] in [[academia]]; the list above provides details.

==Salary==
{{Further|Professors in the United States#Salary}}

[[File:Professor salaries.svg|thumb|Salary of professors, as reported in the 2005 report the {{Interlanguage link multi|Deutscher Hochschulverband|de}} DHV. Bars are for assistant professor, associate professor and full professor, respectively.]]

A professor typically earns a base salary and a range of [[employee benefits]]. In addition, a professor who undertakes additional roles in their institution (e.g., department chair, dean, head of graduate studies, etc.) earns additional income.  Some professors also earn additional income by moonlighting in other jobs, such as [[consultant|consulting]], publishing academic or popular press books, giving speeches, or coaching executives. Some fields (e.g., business and computer science) give professors more opportunities for outside work.

===Germany and Switzerland===
<!-- The entire paragraph is based on an unreferenced report by the DHV. The website of the DHV is given, but that is not enough. I couldn't find the report during a 1 hour long search. -->
A report from 2005 by the "Deutscher Hochschulverband DHV",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hochschulverband.de/ |title=Deutscher Hochschulverband |publisher=Hochschulverband.de |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> a lobby group for German professors, the salary of professors, the annual salary of a German professor is [[Euro|â‚¬]]46,680 in group "W2" (mid-level) and â‚¬56,683 in group "W3" (the highest level), without performance-related bonuses. The anticipated average earnings with performance-related bonuses for a German professor is â‚¬71,500. The anticipated average earnings of a professor working in Switzerland vary for example between 158,953 [[CHF (currency)|CHF]] (â‚¬102,729) to 232,073 CHF (â‚¬149,985) at the [[University of Zurich]] and 187,937 CHF (â‚¬121,461) to 247,280 CHF (â‚¬159,774) at the [[ETH Zurich]]; the regulations are different depending on the [[Cantons of Switzerland]].

===Saudi Arabia===
According to The Ministry of Civil Service, the salary of a professor in any public university is 344,497.5 SAR, or US$91,866.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Spain===
{{Further|Academic ranks in Spain}}
The salaries of civil servant professors in Spain are fixed on a nationwide basis, but there are some bonuses related to performance and seniority and a number of bonuses granted by the Autonomous Regional governments. These bonuses include three-year premiums ({{Lang-es|trienios}}, according to seniority), five-year premiums ({{Lang-es|quinquenios|label=none}}, according to compliance with teaching criteria set by the university) and six-year premiums ({{Lang-es|sexenios|label=none}}, according to compliance with research criteria laid down by the national government). These salary bonuses are relatively small. Nevertheless, the total number of {{Lang-es|sexenios|label=none}} is a prerequisite for being a member of different committees.

The importance of these {{Lang-es|sexenios|label=none}} as a [[Reputation|prestige]] factor in the university was enhanced by legislation in 2001 (LOU). Some indicative numbers can be interesting, in spite of the variance in the data. We report net monthly payments (after taxes and social security fees), without bonuses: [[wikt:ayudante|Ayudante]], â‚¬1,200; [[wikt:ayudante doctor|Ayudante Doctor]], â‚¬1,400; [[wikt:contratado doctor|Contratado Doctor]]; â‚¬1,800; [[wikt:professor titular|Professor Titular]], â‚¬2,000; [[wikt:catedrÃ¡tico|CatedrÃ¡tico]], â‚¬2,400. There are a total of 14 payments per year, including 2 extra payments in July and December (but for less than a normal monthly payment).

===Education professors===
Professors in [[teacher education]] sometimes earn less than they would if they were still elementary classroom teachers.{{Where|date=December 2018}} In one case study report, it was shown that a beginning full-time tenure-track assistant professor in elementary teacher education at [[California State University, Northridge]] was hired in 2002 at a salary of $53,000, which was $15,738 less than she would have earned in her previous position as a 9-month public school kindergarten teacher, $68,738.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From kindergarten teacher to college professor: A comparison chart of salaries, work load, and professional preparation requirements.|last=Coyner|first=Sandra C.|date=2010|publisher=Hawaii International Conference on Education|editor-last=Hawaii International Conference on Education|location=Honolulu, HI|language=English|oclc = 50505381}}</ref>

===Netherlands===
In 2007 the Dutch social fund for the academic sector SoFoKleS<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sofokles.nl/ |title=SoFoKleS &#124; Sociaal Fonds voor de KennisSector |publisher=Sofokles.nl |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> commissioned a comparative study of the wage structure of academic professions in the Netherlands in relation to that of other countries.  Among the countries reviewed are the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, France, Sweden and the Netherlands.  To improve comparability, adjustments have been made to correct for [[purchasing power]] and taxes. Because of differences between institutions in the US and UK these countries have two listings of which one denotes the salary in top-tier institutions (based on the [[Shanghai ranking|Shanghai-ranking]]).

===United States===
[[Professors in the United States]] commonly occupy any of several positions in [[academia]]. In the U.S., the word "professor" informally refers collectively to the [[Academic ranks in the United States|academic ranks]] of '''assistant professor''', '''associate professor''', or '''professor'''. This usage differs from the predominant usage of the word professor internationally, where the unqualified word professor only refers to "full professors." The majority of university lecturers and instructors in the United States, {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, do not occupy these [[tenure-track]] ranks, but are part-time adjuncts.

==Research professor==
In a number of countries, the title "research professor" refers to a professor who is exclusively or mainly engaged in research, and who has few or no teaching obligations. For example, the title is used in this sense in the [[United Kingdom]] (where it is known as research professor at some universities and professorial research fellow at some other institutions) and in [[northern Europe]]. Research professor is usually the most senior rank of a research-focused career pathway in those countries, and regarded as equal to the ordinary full professor rank. Most often they are permanent employees, and the position is often held by particularly distinguished scholars; thus the position is often seen as more prestigious than an ordinary full professorship. The title is used in a somewhat similar sense in the [[Professors in the United States#Research professor|United States]], with the exception that research professors in the United States are often not permanent employees and often must fund their salary from external sources,<ref>[https://www.bu.edu/handbook/appointments-and-promotions/classification-of-ranks-and-titles/ Classification of Ranks and Titles].</ref> which is usually not the case elsewhere.

==In fiction==
{{Main|List of fictional professors}}
[[File:The Adventure of the Final Problem 03.jpg|thumb|[[Professor Moriarty]] from the Sherlock Holmes story "[[The Final Problem]]"]]

Traditional fictional portrayals of professors, in accordance with a [[stereotype]], are shy, absent-minded individuals often lost in thought. In many cases, fictional professors are socially or physically awkward. Examples include the 1961 film ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' or [[Professor Calculus]] of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' stories. Professors have also been portrayed as being misguided into an evil pathway, such as Professor Metz, who helped [[Bond villain]] [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|Blofeld]] in the film ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''; or simply evil, like [[Professor Moriarty]], [[archenemy]] of British detective [[Sherlock Holmes]]. The modern animated series ''[[Futurama]]'' has [[Professor Hubert Farnsworth]], a typical absent-minded but genius-level professor. A related stereotype is the [[mad scientist]].

[[Vladimir Nabokov]], author and professor of [[English studies|English]] at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], frequently used professors as the [[protagonist]]s in his novels. Professor [[Henry Higgins (character)|Henry Higgins]] is a main character in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]''. In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, set at the wizard school [[Hogwarts]], the teachers are known as professors, many of whom play important roles, notably Professors [[Dumbledore]], [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]] and [[Severus Snape|Snape]]. In the board game ''[[Cluedo]]'', Professor Plum has been depicted as an absent-minded academic. [[Christopher Lloyd]] played Plum's [[Clue (film)|film]] counterpart, a [[psychologist]] who had an affair with one of his patients.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, various stereotypes were re-evaluated, including professors. Writers began to depict professors as just normal human beings and might be quite well-rounded in abilities, excelling both in intelligence and in physical skills. An example of a fictional professor not depicted as shy or absent-minded is [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]], a professor as well as an [[archeologist]]-[[adventurer]], who is skilled at both scholarship and fighting. The popularity of the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' movie franchise]] had a significant impact on the previous stereotype, and created a new archetype which is both deeply knowledgeable and physically capable. The character generally referred to simply as [[The Professor (Gilligan's Island)|the Professor]] on the television [[sit com]] series, ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', although described alternatively as a high-school science teacher or research scientist, is depicted as a sensible advisor, a clever inventor, and a helpful friend to his fellow [[castaway]]s. [[John Houseman]]'s portrayal of law school professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr., in ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]'' (1973) remains the [[epitome]] of the strict, authoritarian professor who demands perfection from students. [[Annalise Keating]] (played by [[Viola Davis]]) from the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) [[legal drama]] [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]] television series ''[[How to Get Away with Murder]]'' is a [[law]] professor at the fictional Middleton University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder/cast/annalise-keating|title=Viola Davis as Annalise Keating|website=ABC|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> Early in the series, Annalise is a self-sufficient and confident woman, respected for being a great law professor and a great lawyer, feared and admired by her students,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/how-get-away-murder-pilot-209723|title=How To Get Away With Murder: "Pilot"|last=Kumari Upadhyaya|first=Kayla|date=25 September 2014|website=[[The A.V.

Mysterious, older men with magical powers (and unclear academic standing) are sometimes given the title of "Professor" in literature and theater. Notable examples include Professor Marvel in ''The Wizard of Oz''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/ |title=The Wizard of Oz (1939)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> and Professor Drosselmeyer (as he is sometimes known) from the ballet ''[[The Nutcracker]]''. Also, the magician played by Christian Bale in the film, ''[[The Prestige]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/ |title=The Prestige (2006)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> adopts 'The Professor' as his [[stage name]]. A variation of this type of non-academic professor is the "crackpot inventor", as portrayed by Professor Potts in the film version of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' or the Jerry Lewis-inspired ''[[Professor Frink]]'' character on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Other professors of this type are the thoughtful and kind Professor Digory Kirke of [[C.S. Lewis]]' ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]''.

The title has been used by [[comedian]]s, such as "Professor" [[Irwin Corey]] and [[Soupy Sales]] in his role as "The Big Professor". In the past, [[pianist]]s in [[Western saloon|saloons]] and other rough environments have been called "professor".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930955,00.html |title=Music: Machines & Musicians |work=Time |date=1937-08-30 |accessdate=2009-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417042553/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930955,00.html |archive-date=17 April 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[puppeteer]] of a [[Punch and judy]] show is also traditionally known as a "professor".
