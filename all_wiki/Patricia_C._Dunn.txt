===HP Internal Spying Scandal===
Dunn was at the center of the [[2006 HP Spying Scandal]] because she directed investigations of board-level leaks of information to reporters in 2005-2006.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bianco, Anthony.|title=The big lie : spying, scandal, and ethical collapse at Hewlett-Packard|date=2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-857-4|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=690101897}}</ref> HP hired companies which, while investigating the leaks, obtained the personal telephone records of HP board members and reporters who covered HP through a practice called [[pretexting]].<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Poletti|first1=Therese|last2=Quinn|first2=Michelle|date=2006-09-06|title=HP engulfed in extraordinary boardroom fight|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/15447483.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007143422/https://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/15447483.htm|archive-date=October 7, 2006|access-date=2020-08-03|website=San Jose Mercury News}}</ref> It is illegal under California law to use deceit and trickery to obtain private records of individuals. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

On September 12, 2006, HP announced that [[Mark Hurd]], the company's CEO, would replace Dunn as Chairman after the HP board meeting on January 18, 2007, but that Dunn would continue as an HP board member. But on September 22, 2006, Dunn resigned, effective immediately, from both her position as chairman and from the board of directors of HP. In an official statement, Dunn noted "I accepted the responsibility to identify the sources of those leaks, but I did not propose the specific methods of the investigation ... Unfortunately, the people HP relied upon to conduct this type of investigation let me and the company down. I continue to have the best interests of HP at heart and thus I have accepted the board’s request to resign."<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2006-10-29|title=Patricia Dunn Resigns from HP Board|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2006/060922a.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029073126/http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2006/060922a.html|archive-date=October 29, 2006|access-date=2020-08-03|website=HP.com}}</ref>
