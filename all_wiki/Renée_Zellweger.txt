In her next film, the crime comedy ''[[Love and a .45]]'' (1994), Zellweger played a woman who plans a robbery with her boyfriend. Although the film received a limited release in theaters,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/love_and_a_45/|title=Love and a .45|date=November 23, 1994|website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> Marc Savlov of ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' applauded the main cast saying they were "all excellent in their roles" and noted that "Zellweger's character – all squeals and caged sexuality – seems a bit too close to [[Juliette Lewis]]' Mallory Knox (of ''Natural Born Killers'') to be as fresh as it should be".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/1994-11-25/138391/|title=Love & a .45|work=The Austin Chronicle}}</ref> The part earned her an [[Independent Spirit Award]] for Best Debut Performance. Zellweger subsequently relocated to Los Angeles, a move she had postponed several times because she believed she lacked the talent and experience to be a competitive actor in that city. She would next appear in the [[coming-of-age]] drama ''[[Empire Records]]'' (1995).<ref name="actors" /> [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' consensus was: "Despite a terrific soundtrack and a strong early performance from Renee Zellweger, ''Empire Records'' is mostly a silly and predictable teen dramedy."<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/empire_records Empire Records Movie Reviews, Pictures].

===Breakthrough, 1996–2000===
Zellweger became widely known to audiences with ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' (1996), in which she played a single mother and the romantic interest of a glossy sports agent ([[Tom Cruise]]).

He plays Maguire with the earnestness of a man who wants to find greatness and happiness in an occupation where only success really counts.
