{{Politics of the Philippines}}

The '''vice president of the Philippines''' ({{lang-fil|Pangalawang Pangulo ng Pilipinas}}, informally referred to as ''Bise Presidente ng Pilipinas'', or in {{lang-es|Vicepresidente de Filipinas}}) is the second-highest executive official of the government of the [[Philippines]], after the [[President of the Philippines|president]]. The vice president currently holds office at the [[Quezon City Reception House]] in [[Quezon City]]. Previously, the vice president of the Philippines held office at the [[Coconut Palace]] (located in the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex]]), the [[Philippine National Bank]] Financial Center, and the [[Philippine International Convention Center]] (also located in the CCP Complex), all in [[Pasay]], [[Metro Manila]].

The current office of the vice president was re-established under the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]], bearing similarities with the office as created in the [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]] that was abolished by the [[Marcos regime]].

[[Leni Robredo]] from [[Camarines Sur]] assumed the office on June 30, 2016 as the 14th and current vice president.

==Title==
The official title of the office in Filipino is ''Pangalawang Pangulo,'' although ''Bise Presidente,'' derived from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], is the usual title used in some of the major [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], such as [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and [[Hiligaynon language]].

The text of the 1987 Constitution refers to the person and office of the ''vice-president,'' with a hyphen connecting the two words. However, the person and office is usually referred to today without the hyphen, as the ''vice president.''

==History==

===Colonial era===
[[File:Home provinces of Philippine vice presidents.PNG|thumb|left|180px|Home provinces of the vice presidents.]]The first known vice president claiming to be part of a government was [[Mariano Trías]], whose term started on March 22, 1897. He was elected during the elections of the Tejeros Convention, and was later elected vice president of the Supreme Council that oversaw negotiations for the Biak na Bato pact in 1897. This Supreme Council had no sovereignty, did not govern any state, and was just used for bargaining with the Spanish. This council was replaced later, with no such position existing during the country's declaration of independence in 1898, which had a dictatorial government. Officially, the country's first actual republic was founded in 1899, and it too had no vice president. Trias instead served in the cabinets of [[Apolinario Mabini]] and [[Pedro Paterno]], as finance minister and war minister, respectively. Trias is not considered a Philippine Vice President as the Supreme Council did not proclaim any sovereign state.

===Conceptualization===
The 1935 Constitution of the Philippines established the position of vice president, and may be appointed by the president to a cabinet position. The first person elected to the position of vice president under the constitution was [[Sergio Osmeña]]. Elected together with [[Manuel L. Quezon]] in the first Philippine national elections, Osmeña was given the highest-ranking cabinet portfolio with inauguration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in November 1935. Prior to independence in 1946, that cabinet portfolio was Secretary of Public Instruction, which had once been reserved only for the vice governor-general (an American). Vice President Osmeña held that position from 1935 to 1939, and a similar portfolio in the War Cabinet during World War II.

After independence, the highest-ranking cabinet position became that of Secretary of Foreign Affairs (it is still the highest-ranking cabinet portfolio in official protocol to this day), which was given to Vice President [[Elpidio Quirino]]. Vice President [[Fernando Lopez]] declined the Foreign Affairs portfolio when he became Quirino's vice president in 1949. However, Vice Presidents [[Carlos P. Garcia]] and [[Emmanuel Pelaez]] also held the Foreign Affairs portfolio, a tradition revived in the Fifth Republic, with Vice Presidents [[Salvador Laurel]] and [[Teofisto Guingona, Jr.]] holding the Foreign Affairs portfolio. [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] served as Secretary of Social Welfare and Development. Other Cabinet positions with no Secretary title was given to [[Joseph Estrada]] as Chairman of the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission and [[Noli de Castro]] as Chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council.

Among the vice presidents of the Third Republic, [[Diosdado Macapagal]] alone was not given any cabinet position, since he was the first elected vice-president that did not originate from the same party as the incumbent. [[Arturo Tolentino]] was officially proclaimed vice president-elect by the Regular Batasang Pambansa in 1986. He took his oath as vice president on February 16, 1986 before Chief Justice Ramon Aquino but because of popular belief that the elections had been rigged, he never actually served out his term as vice president. Within a week after Tolentino's oath, the [[People Power Revolution]] resulted in the collapse of the Marcos regime. On February 25, 1986, [[Corazon Aquino]] and [[Salvador H. Laurel]] were sworn in as president and vice president.<ref>[http://ovp.site50.net/ovp/site_content.php?sid=12 The Vice Presidency : A Brief History], Office of the Vice President of the Philippines.</ref>

=== Fourth Republic ===
The office of vice president was abolished and not included in the original version of the 1973 Constitution. It was, however, reinstated in subsequent amendments, just before the snap elections in 1986 that led to the [[People Power Revolution]] that installed [[Corazon Aquino]] into the presidency.

=== Timeline ===
{{Vice President of the Philippines timeline}}

==Eligibility==
Article 7, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution mandates that the vice president must bear the same qualifications as the president which means he must be:
* a natural-born citizen of the Philippines;
* a registered voter;
* able to read and write;
* at least forty years of age on the day of election;
* and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election."<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 2</ref>

== Election and term limits ==
The vice president is elected in the same manner as, but separately from, the president.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 3.</ref> Both the president and the vice president are elected by direct plurality vote where the candidate who garners the highest number of votes, whether a majority or not, wins the election.<ref name=":1">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 4.</ref> While candidates usually run in tandem for the offices of president and vice president, under their own political parties, it is possible and not unusual for candidates from different parties to be elected as president and vice president.

The vice president is barred from serving more than two consecutive terms.<ref name=":1" />

==Succession==
===To Presidency===

The vice president is first in the presidential line of succession. The Constitution provides several circumstances where the vice president (or the vice president-elect) shall assume the presidency or serve as acting president.
* In case of the death, permanent disability, removal from office, or resignation of the president, the vice president shall assume the presidency.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 8.</ref>
* If the president-elect fails to qualify for office, the vice president-elect shall act as president until the president-elect is qualified.<ref name="Article VII"/>
* If in case of death, permanent disability, dismissed from service, resignation or failure to assume the post, the Senate president shall assume the vice presidency.
* If a president is not chosen, then the vice president shall act as president until a president is chosen and qualified.<ref name="Article VII"/>
There has been four cases where the vice president has assumed the presidency, three of which because of the president's death, and one because of the president's resignation:
* [[Sergio Osmeña]] in 1944, upon the death of [[Manuel L. Quezon]].
* [[Elpidio Quirino]] in 1948, upon the death of [[Manuel Roxas]].
* [[Carlos P. Garcia]] in 1957, upon the death of [[Ramon Magsaysay]].
* [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] in 2001, upon the resignation of [[Joseph Estrada|Joseph Ejercito Estrada]], as decided by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/mar2001/146710_15.htm|title = Philippine Supreme Court Decision. G.R. Nos. 146710-15. March 2, 2001.|date = |accessdate = |website = Supreme Court of the Philippines|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

===To Vice-Presidency===

Under Section 9 of Article VII of the 1987 Philippines Constitution whenever there is a vacancy in the Office of the Vice-President during the term for which he was elected, the President shall nominate a Vice-President from among the Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives who shall assume office upon confirmation by a majority vote of all the Members of both Houses of the Congress, voting separately.<ref name="Article VII">{{cite web |title=THE 1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES – ARTICLE VII |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-vii/ |accessdate=4 November 2020}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Hence, when the Vice-president became the president by succession, he/she can nominate a member of the Congress with confirmation from the Majority of all the members of both Houses of the Congress. The Senate President may not directly be in succession for the position of the Vice-Presidency, unless he/she was nominated.

There is only one instance where a member of the Congress has assumed the vacant vice-presidency position, that is in the case of [[Teofisto Guingona Jr.|Teofisto Guingona Jr]]., who was appointed as Vice President of the Philippines by Arroyo on February 7, 2001. Guingona is the only vice president who was not nationally elected to the position. He is also the oldest person to hold the position when he was appointed at the age of 72. He also concurrently served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs.

==Salary==

The vice president is paid ₱367,609 (approximately US$7,600) per month and ₱4,411,308 per year as of January 1, 2021 by virtue of an Executive Order signed by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] on January 8, 2020 <ref>https://governmentph.com/salary-grade-2020-table/</ref>

The salary of the vice president is determined by Congress and the pay cannot be reduced during his tenure. Any increase approved during his tenure can only take effect after such tenure.

==Seat==
[[File:Coconut Palace Court.jpg|thumb|The [[Coconut Palace]] was the residence of the Vice President during the term of Jejomar Binay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/19/10/binay-set-coconut-palace-move|title=Binay set for Coconut Palace move|author=ABS-CBN Corp.|publisher=}}</ref>]]
Historically, the vice president was not given an official residence. However, the vice president also held office along with the president at the Executive Building (now Kalayaan Hall) in the complex of [[Malacañang Palace]] from 1935 until 1972, when the position was abolished under martial law and the 1973 Constitution. When the position was reinstated, Vice President [[Salvador Laurel|Salvador H. Laurel]] held office at the former Legislative Building on [[Padre Burgos Avenue]], [[Manila]], until the building became the [[National Museum of Fine Arts (Manila)|National Museum of Fine Arts]] of the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. The vice president's office was transferred to the [[Philippine International Convention Center]], and again to the [[Philippine National Bank|PNB]] Financial Center, both in [[Pasay]], [[Metro Manila]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quezon.ph/2010/06/11/for-trivia-hunters-benigno-s-aquino-iii-and-the-presidency/|title=For trivia-hunters, Benigno S. Aquino III and the presidency (updated)|publisher=}}</ref> In 2011, the [[Coconut Palace]] also in [[Pasay City|Pasay]] was designated as the principal workplace of the vice president of the Philippines. Beginning June 30, 2016, the office was transferred to the [[Quezon City Reception House]] in [[Quezon City]].
