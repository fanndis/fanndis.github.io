==Corporate history==
===Establishment===
The idea for Bain & Company was conceived by co-founder William Worthington Bain Jr. during his time at the [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG).<ref name="directory"/><ref name="Gallese 1989"/> In 1970, BCG CEO [[Bruce Henderson]] decided to divide his firm into three competing mini-firms: blue, red, and green. Bill Bain and Patrick Graham headed the blue team.<ref name="Kiechel 2010 p. 224"/> The blue team accounted for over half of BCG's revenue and profits and won the internal competition. After the competition, Bill Bain grew increasingly frustrated by the wait for Henderson's retirement, the firm's project-based approach to consulting, and the refusal of management to help clients execute on the firm's advice.<ref name="directory"/><ref name="Gallese 1989"/> Around this time, he is quoted to have said to feel like "a consultant on a desert island, writing a report, putting it in a bottle, throwing it in the water, then going on to the next one."<ref name="Kiechel 2010 p. 224"/>

Bain was the expected successor of Henderson within BCG in the early 70s.<ref name="directory"/><ref name="Gallese 1989"/> However, in 1973, three years after Henderson's competing team decision, Bill Bain resigned to start his own consulting firm.<ref name="Kiechel 2010 p. 224"/>{{efn|Some sources say he started a software company first.<ref name="directory"/>}} Most of the senior members of the "blue team" followed him to his newfound company, which was started from his apartment in the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill neighborhood]] of Boston.<ref name="vault">{{citation|date=2001|work=Vault Employer Profile|title=Bain & Company|url=http://www.sk2arch.com/books/download/asin=1581311915&type=stream|access-date=2020-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215122955/http://www.sk2arch.com/books/download/asin%3D1581311915%26type%3Dstream|archive-date=2018-12-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> A significant part of firms for which he was responsible at BCG also followed Bain to the new company. Within a few weeks, Bain & Company was working with seven former BCG clients;<ref name="directory"/> this included two of BCG's largest clients, [[Black & Decker]] and [[Texas Instruments]].<ref name="Gallese 1989"/><ref name="Kiechel 2010 p. 224"/><ref name="Bloomberg.com 1991"/> As a result, Henderson accused Bill of stealing BCG's clientele.<ref name="Gallese 1989"/> It is believed that the competition Henderson put out laid the foundation for Bain & Company.<ref name="Kiechel 2010 p. 224"/>

In 1985 and 1986, Bain & Company took out loans to buy 30 percent of the firm from Bain and other partners for $200 million and used the shares to create an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).<ref name="Bloomberg.com 1991"/><ref name="Washington Post 2012">{{cite web | title=Did Mitt Romney get a 'bailout' for Bain & Company? | website=Washington Post | date=July 24, 2012 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/did-mitt-romney-get-a-bailout-for-bain-and-company/2012/07/24/gJQAvzSh7W_blog.html | access-date=July 12, 2017}}</ref> These shares of the company were bought at five times Bain & Company's annual revenue, more than double the norm, and cost the firm $25 million in annual interest fees, exacerbating the firm's financial troubles.<ref name="Bloomberg.com 1991"/> Bain hired former U.S. Army general [[Pete Dawkins]] as the head of North America in hopes that new leadership could bring about a turnaround, but Dawkins' leadership led to even more turnover at the firm.<ref name="directory"/> Bill Bain also attempted to sell the firm but was unsuccessful at finding a buyer.<ref name="directory"/>

According to ''The New York Times'', the results of Bain's consulting "have often been impressive."<ref name="reception 1">{{cite news | last=Gallese | first=Liz Roman | title=Counselor To The King | website=NYTimes.com | date=September 24, 1989 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/24/magazine/counselor-to-the-king.html | access-date=July 3, 2017|quote=Over the years, Bain's list of major clients grew to encompass some of the leading corporations of the nation, including the likes of Baxter International, Burlington Industries, Dun & Bradstreet, Hughes Tool, Iowa Beef, Monsanto and Wells Fargo. The results have often been impressive. In a March 1989 Price Waterhouse audit, the market value of all of Bain's clients was shown to have increased 456 percent since 1980. The audit was based on the in-house Bain Index. It compares the performance of clients' stocks with that of the Dow Jones industrial average, which was up only 192 percent. Bain claims that, for every dollar it charges clients, they increase their profits by a factor of 5 to 10.}}</ref> An audit by [[Price Waterhouse]] found that the aggregate market value of Bain clients increased 456 percent from 1980 to 1989, whereas the Dow Jones industrial average increased 192 percent during the same time period.<ref name="reception 1" /><ref name="reception 2">{{cite web | first=Nancy |last=Perry|title=A Consulting Firm Too Hot to Handle?

With Bainies swarming all over them, it becomes difficult for clients to disengage themselves from the firm. Says one: ''They anchor themselves in the stomach of the business. They forge a dependent relationship: 'If you have a problem, call us.' There should be a weaning-away process.''}}</ref>
