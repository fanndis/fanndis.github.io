AT&T began its history as '''Southwestern Bell Telephone Company''', a subsidiary of the [[Bell Telephone Company]], founded by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1877. The Bell Telephone Company became the '''American Telephone and Telegraph Company''' in 1885 and was later rebranded as [[AT&T Corporation]]. The 1982 ''[[United States v. AT&T]]'' [[antitrust]] lawsuit resulted in the [[Bell System divestiture|divestiture]] of AT&T Corporation's ("Ma Bell") subsidiaries or [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]] (RBOCs), commonly referred to as  "Baby Bells", resulting in several independent companies, including Southwestern Bell Corporation; the latter changed its name to '''SBC Communications Inc.''' in 1995. In 2005, SBC purchased its former parent AT&T Corporation and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself AT&T Inc. and using its history, iconic logo and stock-trading symbol. AT&T Inc. acquired [[BellSouth]] in 2006, the last independent Baby Bell company, making its formerly joint venture [[Cingular|Cingular Wireless]] (which had acquired AT&T Wireless in 2004) wholly owned and rebranding it as [[AT&T Mobility]].

The current AT&T [[Breakup of the Bell System#Evolution of the Baby Bells|reconstitutes much of the former Bell System]], and includes ten of the original 22 Bell Operating Companies along with the original [[AT&T Communications|long-distance division]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kleinfield |first=Sony |url=https://archive.org/details/biggestcompanyon00klei |title=The biggest company on earth: a profile of AT&T |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-03-045326-7 |location=New York |url-access=registration}}</ref>

The company maintains a database of [[call detail record]]s of all telephone calls that have passed through its network since 1987. AT&T employees work at [[High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area]] offices (operated by the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]]) in [[Los Angeles]], [[Atlanta]], and [[Houston]] so data can be quickly turned over to law enforcement agencies. Records are requested via an administrative subpoena, without the involvement of a court or grand jury.

=== Censorship ===
In September 2007, AT&T changed its legal policy to state that "AT&T may immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Service, any Member ID, electronic mail address, IP address, Universal Resource Locator or domain name used by you, without notice for conduct that AT&T believes ...

{{further|NSA call database|Room 641A|Mark Klein|NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|Hepting v. AT&T}}

In 2006, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lodged the [[class action]] lawsuit ''Hepting v. AT&T'', which alleged that AT&T had allowed agents of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to monitor phone and Internet communications of AT&T customers without warrants. If true, this would violate the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] of 1978 and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendments]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. AT&T has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring. In April 2006, retired former AT&T technician Mark Klein lodged an [[affidavit]] supporting this allegation.<ref>Nakashima, Ellen, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/07/AR2007110700006_pf.html "A Story of Surveillance"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119082703/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/07/AR2007110700006_pf.html |date=November 19, 2010 }}, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 7, 2007</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Singel |first=Ryan |date=April 7, 2006 |title=Whistle-Blower Outs NSA Spy Room |publisher=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/04/70619 |url-status=live |access-date=September 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430142924/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/04/70619 |archive-date=April 30, 2008}}</ref> The Department of Justice has stated it will intervene in this lawsuit by means of [[State Secrets Privilege]].<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Government Moves to Intervene in AT&T Surveillance Case |date=April 28, 2006 |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) |url=https://www.eff.org/news/archives/2006_04.php#004613 |access-date=September 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123042/http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2006_04.php#004613 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In July 2006, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California – in which the suit was filed – rejected a federal government motion to dismiss the case. The motion to dismiss, which invoked the State Secrets Privilege, had argued that any court review of the alleged partnership between the federal government and AT&T would harm national security. The case was immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit. It was dismissed on June 3, 2009, citing retroactive legislation in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} <ref>Arshad Mohammed, Washington Post.

In May 2006, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that all international and domestic calling records had been handed over to the National Security Agency by AT&T, Verizon, SBC, and BellSouth for the purpose of creating a massive [[NSA call database|calling database]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cauley |first=Leslie |date=May 11, 2006 |title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls |work=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm |url-status=live |access-date=September 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223235913/http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm |archive-date=February 23, 2011}}</ref> The portions of the ''new'' AT&T that had been part of SBC Communications before November 18, 2005, were not mentioned.

On June 21, 2006, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that AT&T had rewritten rules on its privacy policy. The policy, which took effect June 23, 2006, says that "AT&T – not customers – owns customers' confidential info and can use it 'to protect its legitimate business interests, safeguard others, or respond to legal process.'"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lazarus |first=David |date=June 21, 2006 |title=AT&T Rewrites Rules: Your Data Isn't Yours |work=San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/21/BUG9VJHB9C1.DTL&hw=at&sn=002&sc=870 |url-status=live |access-date=September 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112225858/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F06%2F21%2FBUG9VJHB9C1.DTL&hw=at&sn=002&sc=870 |archive-date=November 12, 2007}}</ref>

=== Discrimination against local Public-access television channels ===
AT&T has been accused by [[community media]] groups of discriminating against local [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) cable TV channels, by "impictions that will severely restrict the audience".<ref name="dn10">(March 9, 2009) [http://www.democracynow.org/2009/3/9/at_t_accused_of_discriminating_against "AT&T Accused of Discriminating Against Local Public Access Channels, Deadline for Public Comment Expires Tonight"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312075258/http://www.democracynow.org/2009/3/9/at_t_accused_of_discriminating_against |date=March 12, 2009 }}, [[Democracy Now!]]. Retrieved March 13, 2009.</ref>

According to Barbara Popovic, Executive Director of the Chicago public-access service [[Chicago Access Network Television|CAN-TV]], the new AT&T [[U-verse]] system forced all [[Public-access television]] into a special menu system, denying normal functionality such as channel numbers, access to the standard [[program guide]], and DVR recording.<ref name="dn10" /> The Ratepayer Advocates division of the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] reported: "Instead of putting the stations on individual channels, AT&T has bundled community stations into a generic channel that can only be navigated through a complex and lengthy process."<ref name="dn10" />

Sue Buske (president of telecommunications consulting firm the Buske Group and a former head of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers/[[Alliance for Community Media]]) argue that this is "an overall attack [...] on public access across the [United States], the place in the dial around cities and communities where people can make their own media in their own communities".<ref name="dn10" />

=== Information security ===

In April 2015, AT&T was fined $25 million over data security breaches, marking the largest ever fine issued by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) for breaking data privacy laws.

=== Accusations of enabling fraud ===
{{unbalanced|date=November 2016}}
In March 2012, the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT&T. The specific accusations state that AT&T "violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated the use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&T's call volume. The government's complaint alleges that AT&T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result."<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 22, 2012 |title=Welcome to the United States Department of Justice |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/March/12-civ-357.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519015822/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/March/12-civ-357.html |archive-date=May 19, 2012 |access-date=May 11, 2012 |publisher=Justice.gov}}</ref> In September 2020, AT&T and Verizon agreed to pay a combined $116 million settlement.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Osborne |first=Charlie |title=Verizon, AT&T settle overcharging whistleblower case for $116 million |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/verizon-at-t-settle-overcharging-whistleblower-case-for-116-million/ |access-date=2020-09-25 |website=ZDNet |language=en}}</ref>

On January 24, 2017, Slator sued AT&T in the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court|Los Angeles Superior Court]], accusing the company of [[defamation]] and wrongful termination. Slator had been involved in organizing AT&T's planned $48.5 billion acquisition of DirecTV since 2014, and he claimed that when news headlines speculated that his text messages could prevent the acquisition from going through, he was fired as a "scapegoat" by company executives. He also claimed that the executives had known about the text messages since at least late 2013, and had promised him at the time that he would not be fired for them.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Garrett |first=Arnessa |date=January 25, 2017 |title=AT&T sued by exec who was fired over racist text |work=The Dallas Morning News |url=https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2017/01/25/att-sued-by-exec-who-was-fired-over-racist-text/ |url-status=live |access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Robb |first=David |date=January 24, 2017 |title=Former AT&T Content President Files Wrongful Termination Suit, Claims He Was Fired To Save DirecTV Merger |work=Deadline |url=https://deadline.com/2017/01/lawsuit-attt-directv-aaron-slator-sues-for-wrongful-termination-1201892998/ |url-status=live |access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref>
