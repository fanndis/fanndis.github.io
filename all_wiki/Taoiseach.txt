The '''Taoiseach''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Ga-Taoiseach.ogg|ˈ|t|iː|ʃ|ə|x}}<ref>{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|Taoiseach|accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> {{IPA-ga|ˈt̪ˠiːʃəx|lang}}) is the prime minister and [[head of government]] of Ireland.<ref name="ConstitIrl" group="note" /> The Taoiseach is appointed by the [[President of Ireland|President]] upon the nomination of [[Dáil Éireann]], the lower house of the [[Oireachtas]] (Ireland's national legislature), and must retain the support of a majority in the Dáil to remain in office.

The word {{lang|ga|taoiseach}} (plural {{lang|ga|taoisigh}}, {{IPA-ga|t̪ˠiːʃʲɪɡ|pron}} {{respell|TEE|shig}}) means "chief" or "leader" in [[Irish language|Irish]] and was adopted in the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] as the title of the "head of the Government, or Prime Minister".<ref name="ConstitIrl" group="note"  /> Taoiseach is the official title of the head of government in both English and Irish, and is not used for other countries' prime ministers (who are referred to in Irish by the generic term {{lang|ga|príomh-aire}}, {{IPA-ga|ˌpˠɾˠiːvˠ ˈaɾʲə|}} {{respell|pree|VAIR|ə}}). The longer Irish form, {{lang|ga|an Taoiseach}}, is sometimes used in English instead of "the Taoiseach". 

[[Micheál Martin]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] is the current Taoiseach; he took office on 27 June 2020, following a coalition agreement between his party [[Fianna Fáil]], [[Fine Gael]], and the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/watch-micheal-martin-and-mary-lou-mcdonald-nominated-for-taoiseach-as-civil-war-politics-ends-1007831.html |title=33rd Dáil elects Micheál Martin as new Taoiseach |date=27 June 2020 |work=[[Irish Examiner]] |accessdate=27 June 2020 }}</ref>

==Overview==
Under the [[Constitution of Ireland]], the Taoiseach is [[Dáil vote for Taoiseach|nominated by a simple majority of the voting members of Dáil Éireann]]. They are then formally appointed to office by the President, who is required to appoint whomever the Dáil designates, without the option of declining to make the appointment. For this reason, the Taoiseach may, informally, be said to have been "elected" by Dáil Éireann.

If the Taoiseach loses the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann, they are not automatically removed from office. Instead, they are compelled either to resign or to persuade the President to dissolve the Dáil. If the President refuses to grant a dissolution, this effectively forces the Taoiseach to resign. To date, no president has exercised this prerogative, although the option arose in 1944 and 1994, and twice in 1982. The Taoiseach may lose the support of Dáil Éireann by the passage of a [[Confidence motions in Dáil Éireann|vote of no confidence]], or implicitly, through the failure of a vote of confidence. Alternatively, the Dáil may [[Loss of supply|refuse supply]].<ref group="note">One example of the Dáil refusing supply occurred in January 1982, when the then [[Fine Gael]]–[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] coalition government of [[Garret FitzGerald]] lost a vote on the budget. [http://www.rte.ie/news/elections2007/history80s.html]</ref> In the event of the Taoiseach's resignation, they continue to exercise the duties and functions of office until the appointment of a successor.

The Taoiseach nominates the remaining members of the [[Government of Ireland|Government]], who are then, with the consent of the Dáil, appointed by the President. The Taoiseach is authorised to advise the President to dismiss cabinet ministers from office; by convention the President follows this advice. The Taoiseach is further responsible for appointing eleven members of the [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]].

The [[Department of the Taoiseach]] is the government department which supports and advises the Taoiseach in carrying out their various duties.

===Salary===
Since 2013, the Taoiseach's annual salary is €185,350.<ref name=Journal.ie>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/taoiseach-ministers-public-servants-pay-cuts-976714-Jul2013/|title=The Taoiseach, Ministers and every TD are having their pay cut today|work=TheJournal.ie|date=4 July 2013|accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> It was cut from €214,187 to €200,000 when [[Enda Kenny]] took office, before being cut further to €185,350 under the Haddington Road Agreement in 2013.

A proposed increase of €38,000 in 2007 was deferred when [[Brian Cowen]] became Taoiseach<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/1025/politics.html|title=Taoiseach to receive €38k pay rise|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=25 October 2007}}</ref> and in October 2008, the government announced a 10% salary cut for all ministers, including the Taoiseach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1015/budget.html|title=Sharp exchanges in Dáil over Budget|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=15 October 2008|accessdate=29 January 2009}}</ref> However this was a voluntary cut and the salaries remained nominally the same with both ministers and Taoiseach essentially refusing 10% of their salary. This courted controversy in December 2009 when a salary cut of 20% was based on the higher figure before the refused amount was deducted.<ref name="Paycuts criticised">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/budget/comment-reaction/opposition-says-lenihans-salary-cuts-do-not-add-up-1969628.html|title=Opposition says Lenihan's salary cuts do not add up|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=10 December 2009|accessdate=29 December 2009}}</ref> The Taoiseach is also allowed an additional €118,981 in annual expenses.

===Residence===
There is no official residence of the Taoiseach. In 2008 it was reported speculatively that the former [[Steward's Lodge]] at [[Farmleigh]] adjoining the [[Phoenix Park]] would become the official residence of the Taoiseach; however no official statements were made nor any action taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/opulent-phoenix-park-lodge-is--set-to-become-fortress-cowen-1378987.html|title=Opulent Phoenix Park lodge is set to become 'Fortress Cowen'|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=18 May 2008|accessdate=18 May 2008}}</ref> The house, which forms part of the Farmleigh estate acquired by the State in 1999 for €29.2m, was renovated at a cost of nearly €600,000 in 2005 by the [[Office of Public Works]]. Former Taoiseach [[Bertie Ahern]] did not use it as a residence, but his successor Brian Cowen used it occasionally.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0129/1232923372778.html|title=Cowen questioned on use of Farmleigh|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=29 January 2009|accessdate=29 January 2009}}</ref>

==History==
===Origins and etymology===
The words {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}} and {{lang|ga|[[Tánaiste]]}} (the title of the deputy prime minister) are both from the [[Irish language]] and of ancient origin. Though the Taoiseach is described in the Constitution of Ireland as "the head of the Government or Prime Minister",{{refn|Article 13.1.1° and Article 28.5.1° of the [[Constitution of Ireland]]. The latter provision reads: "The head of the Government, or Prime Minister, shall be called, and is in this Constitution referred to as, the Taoiseach."

===Debate on the title===
In 1937 when the draft Constitution of Ireland was being debated in the [[Dáil]], [[Frank MacDermot]], an opposition politician, moved an amendment to substitute "Prime Minister" for the proposed "Taoiseach" title in the English text of the Constitution. It was proposed to keep the "Taoiseach" title in the Irish language text. The proponent remarked:<ref>[https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1937-05-26/20/ Frank Mr. MacDermot of the [[Centre Party (Ireland)]] – Bunreacht na hÉireann (Dréacht)—Coiste (Ath-thógaint) – Wednesday, 26 May 1937; Dáil Éireann Debate Vol. 67 No. 9].</ref>
{{quote|It seems to me to be mere make-believe to try to incorporate a word like "Taoiseach" in the English language. It would be pronounced wrongly by 99 percent of the people. I have already ascertained it is a very difficult word to pronounce correctly. That being so, even for the sake of the dignity of the Irish language, it would be more sensible that when speaking English we should be allowed to refer to the gentleman in question as the Prime Minister... It is just one more example of the sort of things that are being done here as if for the purpose of putting off the people in the [[Northern Ireland|North]]. No useful purpose of any kind can be served by compelling us, when speaking English, to refer to An Taoiseach rather than to the Prime Minister.}}

The President of the Executive Council, Éamon de Valera, gave the term's meaning as "chieftain" or "Captain". He said he was "not disposed" to support the proposed amendment and felt the word "Taoiseach" did not need to be changed. The proposed amendment was defeated on a vote and "Taoiseach" was included as the title ultimately adopted by [[Irish constitutional plebiscite, 1937|plebiscite of the people]].<ref>[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1937/05/26/00015.asp – Bunreacht na hÉireann (Dréacht)—Coiste (Ath-thógaint) – Wednesday, 26 May 1937; Dáil Éireann Debate Vol. 67 No. 9].</ref>

===Modern office===
[[File:Dublin Dept Taoiseach.jpg|thumb|[[Department of the Taoiseach]] at [[Government Buildings]], [[Merrion Street]], Dublin]]
The modern position of Taoiseach was established by the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] and is the most powerful role in Irish politics. The office replaced the position of [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] of the 1922–1937 [[Irish Free State]]. 

The positions of Taoiseach and President of the Executive Council differed in certain fundamental respects. Under the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], the latter was vested with considerably less power and was largely just the chairman of the cabinet, the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]]. For example, the President of the Executive Council could not dismiss a fellow minister on his own authority. Instead, the Executive Council had to be disbanded and reformed entirely to remove a member. The President of the Executive Council also did not have the right to advise the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]] to dissolve Dáil Éireann on his own authority, that power belonging collectively to the Executive Council.

In contrast, the Taoiseach created in 1937 possesses a much more powerful role. The holder of the position can both advise the President to dismiss ministers and dissolve Parliament on his own authority—advice that the President is almost always required to follow by convention.<ref group="note">Among the most famous ministerial dismissals have been those of [[Charles Haughey]] and [[Neil Blaney]] during the [[Arms Crisis]] in 1970, [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] in 1990 and [[Albert Reynolds]], [[Pádraig Flynn]] and [[Máire Geoghegan-Quinn]] in 1991.</ref> His role is greatly enhanced because under the Constitution, he is both ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' chief executive. In most other parliamentary democracies, the head of state is at least the nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In Ireland, however, executive power is explicitly vested in the Government, of which the Taoiseach is the leader.

Since the Taoiseach is the head of government, and may remove ministers at will, many of the powers specified, in law or the constitution, to be exercised by the government as a collective body, are in reality at the will of the Taoiseach. The Government almost always backs the Taoiseach in major decisions, and in many cases often merely formalizes that decision at a subsequent meeting after it has already been announced.  Nevertheless the need for collective decision making on paper acts as a safeguard against an unwise decision made by the Taoiseach.

Historically, where there have been multi-party or coalition governments, the Taoiseach has been the leader of the largest party in the coalition. One exception to this was [[John A. Costello]], who was not leader of his party, but an agreed choice to head the government, because the other parties refused to accept then [[Fine Gael]] leader [[Richard Mulcahy]] as Taoiseach. In 2010 Taoiseach Brian Cowen, in the midst of highly unpopular spending cuts after the global financial crash, maintained his position as Taoiseach until new elections, but stood down as leader of [[Fianna Fáil]] and allowed [[Micheál Martin]] (who had resigned in protest at the way Cowen responded to the crises) to succeed him.

The book ''Chairman or Chief: The Role of the Taoiseach in Irish Government'' (1971) by [[Brian Farrell (broadcaster)|Brian Farrell]] provides a good overview of the conflicting roles for the Taoiseach. Though long out of print, it may still be available in libraries or from booksellers. Biographies are also available of de Valera, Lemass, Lynch, Cosgrave, FitzGerald, Haughey, Reynolds and Ahern. FitzGerald wrote an autobiography, while an authorised biography was produced of de Valera. There is a chapter by Garret FitzGerald on the role of the Taoiseach in a festschrift to Brian Farrell. There is a chapter by Eoin O'Malley on the Taoiseach and cabinet in ''Governing Ireland: From cabinet government to delegated governance'' (Eoin O'Malley and Muiris MacCarthaigh eds.) Dublin: IPA 2012.
