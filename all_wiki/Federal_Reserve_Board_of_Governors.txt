The '''Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System''', commonly known as the '''Federal Reserve Board''', is the main governing body of the [[Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve System]]. It is charged with overseeing the [[Federal Reserve Banks]] and with helping implement the [[monetary policy of the United States]]. Governors are appointed by the [[president of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] for staggered 14-year terms.<ref name=usc12-241>See {{usc|12|241}}</ref><ref name="federalreserve1">{{cite news|author=Federal Reserve|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqbog.htm|title=Board of Governors FAQ|work=Federal Reserve|date=January 16, 2009|access-date=2009-01-16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117011308/http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqbog.htm|archive-date=January 17, 2009}}</ref>

==Statutory description==
By law, the appointments must yield a "fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country".<ref name=usc12-241/><ref name="federalreserve1"/> As stipulated in the [[Banking Act of 1935]], the [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Chair]] and Vice Chair of the Board are two of seven members of the [[Board of Governors]] who are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] from among the sitting Governors.<ref name=usc12-241/><ref name="federalreserve1"/>

The terms of the seven members of the Board span multiple presidential and congressional terms. Once a member of the Board of Governors is appointed by the president, he or she functions mostly independently. Such independence is unanimously supported by major economists.<ref>http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/fed-appointments</ref> The Board is required to make an annual report of operations to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref>{{usc|12|247}}.</ref> It also supervises and regulates the operations of the Federal Reserve Banks, and the U.S. banking system in general. The Board obtains its funding from charges that it assesses on the Federal Reserve Banks, and not from the federal budget.

Membership is by statute limited in term, and a member that has served for a full 14-year term is not eligible for reappointment.<ref name=usc12-242/> There are numerous occasions where an individual was appointed to serve the remainder of another member's uncompleted term, and has been reappointed to serve a full 14-year term.<ref name=usc12-242/> Since "upon the expiration of their terms of office, members of the Board shall continue to serve until their successors are appointed and have qualified",<ref name=usc12-242/> it is possible for a member to serve for significantly longer than a full term of 14 years. The law provides for the removal of a member of the Board by the President "for cause".<ref name=usc12-242>See {{usc|12|242}}.</ref>

The Chair and Vice Chair of the Board of Governors are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] from among the sitting Governors. They both serve a four-year term and they can be renominated as many times as the President chooses, until their terms on the Board of Governors expire.<ref name=usc12-241/>

All seven board members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and five [[Federal Reserve Bank]] presidents direct the open market operations that sets U.S. monetary policy through their membership in the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] (FOMC).<ref name="Fed website">{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/pf_2.pdf|title=The Three Key System Entities|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System}}</ref>
