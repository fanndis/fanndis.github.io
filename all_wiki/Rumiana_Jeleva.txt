'''Rumiana Ruseva Jeleva''' ({{lang-bg|Румяна Русева Желева}}; born April 18, 1969) was Bulgaria's minister of foreign affairs (July 2009 – January 2010), the third woman to hold this office after [[Irina Bokova]] and [[Nadezhda Mihailova]]. Jeleva was a key figure in the "[[GERB]]" political party which won the 2009 parliamentary elections. From 2007–2009 she served as [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) and headed the Bulgarian delegation in the EPP Group. She was nominated by Prime Minister [[Boyko Borisov]] as Commissioner in the "Barroso II Commission" and was affiliated with the [[European People's Party]] (EPP).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8378401.stm "Barroso gets new EU Commission team"], BBC News, 25 November 2009; accessed November 28, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.epp.eu/newsdetail.php?hoofdmenuID=4&newsID=572&submenuID=49&subsubmenuID=147 "Barroso II: 13 EPP Commissioners receive key portfolios"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, European People's Party, 27 November 2009; accessed November 28, 2009</ref> However, an article in the German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' accused her husband of links with the [[Russian mafia]].<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/29222 Bulgaria backpedals on Turkey compensation claim], ''[[EUObserver]]'', 2010-01-08</ref>

Jeleva holds a B.A. in sociology from the [[University of Sofia]] (1995) and a PhD in sociology from [[Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg]] (2003).<ref>http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/public/geoSearch/view.do?country=BG&partNumber=1&language=EN&id=38609</ref>

== Pronunciation ==
The Bulgarian pronunciation of the name ''Jeleva'' is {{IPA-bg|ˈʒɛlɛvɐ|}}, with the {{IPA|[ʒ]}}-sound of English ''plea'''s'''ure'' (voiced palato-alveolar fricative). According to the current official standards for the [[Romanization of Bulgarian]], her name should be transliterated as "Zheleva". Because of this confusion, some people erroneously pronounce the name with a ''y''-sound, {{IPA|[j]}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Failure in EC hearings and end of political career ==
Jeleva was Bulgaria's nominee for [[European Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response]]. During her January 2010 confirmation hearing, she repeatedly failed to answer questions regarding allegations over her financial interests. She also failed to demonstrate sufficient competence in the areas she was to oversee.<ref name="evoice">[http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2010/01/jeleva-remains-barroso%27s-weakest-link/66845.aspx "Jeleva remains Barroso's weakest link"] from europeanvoice.com, retrieved January 2010</ref> Her defensive and seemingly arrogant attitude and her poor language skills further jeopardized her candidacy.<ref name="evoice"/> Facing a storm of disapproval at home, on January 19, 2010, Jeleva sent a letter of resignation to Bulgarian Prime Minister [[Boyko Borisov]], stepping down as both commissioner-designate and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and putting an end to her political career.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/8467345.stm  "Bulgaria nominee for EU Commission steps down] from BBC NEWS retrieved January 19, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.mfa.bg/bg/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20692&Itemid=216 Letter from Dr. Jeleva to the prime minister Boiko Borissov (in Bulgarian)]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> She was replaced as commissioner-designate by [[Kristalina Georgieva]] and as Minister of Foreign Affairs by [[Nickolay Mladenov]].
