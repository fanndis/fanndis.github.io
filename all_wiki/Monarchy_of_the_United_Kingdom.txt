The '''monarchy of the United Kingdom<!--Please do not add "of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"; it was "Great Britain" only from 1707 and "Great Britain and Ireland" from 1801-->''', commonly referred to as the '''British monarchy''', is the [[constitutional monarchy]] of the [[United Kingdom]], its [[Crown dependencies|dependencies]] (the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], the [[Bailiwick of Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]]) and its [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territories]]. The current monarch and [[head of state]] is Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who ascended the throne in 1952.

The monarch and [[British royal family|their immediate family]] undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional the monarch is limited to functions such as bestowing [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] and [[kissing hands|appointing]] the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], which are performed in a non-partisan manner. The monarch is also [[Head of the British Armed Forces]]. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government is still formally by and through the monarch's [[royal prerogative]], these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and [[precedent]]. The [[Government of the United Kingdom]] is known as Her (His) Majesty's Government.

The British monarchy traces its origins from the [[petty kingdom]]s of [[early medieval Scotland]] and [[Anglo-Saxon England]], which consolidated into the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] by the 10th century. England was [[Norman conquest of England|conquered by the Normans]] in 1066, after which [[Wales]] too gradually came under control of [[Anglo-Normans]]. The process was completed in the 13th century when the [[Principality of Wales]] became a [[client state]] of the English kingdom. Meanwhile, ''[[Magna Carta]]'' began a process of reducing the English monarch's political powers. From 1603, the English and Scottish kingdoms were ruled by a [[Union of the crowns|single sovereign]]. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican [[Commonwealth of England]], which followed the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. The [[Act of Settlement 1701]] excluded [[Roman Catholics]] and their spouses from succession to the English throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and in 1801, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] joined to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The British monarch was the nominal head of the vast [[British Empire]], which covered a quarter of the world's land area at its greatest extent in 1921.

In the early 1920s the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] recognised the evolution of the [[Dominion]]s of the Empire into separate, self-governing countries within a [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In the years after the [[Second World War]], the vast majority of British colonies and territories became independent, effectively bringing the Empire to an end. [[George VI]] and his successor, Elizabeth II, adopted the title [[Head of the Commonwealth]] as a symbol of the free association of its independent member states. The United Kingdom and fifteen other independent sovereign states that share the same person as their monarch are called [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Although the monarch is shared, each country is sovereign and independent of the others, and the monarch has a different, specific, and official national [[List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II#Royal titles and styles|title and style]] for each realm.

==Constitutional role==
In the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]], the monarch (otherwise referred to as the [[sovereign]] or "His/Her [[Majesty]]", abbreviated H.M.) is the [[head of state]].  The Queen's image is used to signify British [[sovereignty]] and government authorityâ€”her profile, for instance, appearing on [[Pound sterling|currency]],<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coinageandbanknotes.aspx|title=Symbols of the Monarchy: Coinage and bank notes|accessdate=18 June 2010|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref> and her portrait in government buildings.<ref>{{citation |last1=Aslet |first1=Clive |title=Our picture of Her Majesty will never fade |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10844075/Our-picture-of-Her-Majesty-will-never-fade.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=30 October 2018 |date=21 May 2014}}</ref> The sovereign is further both mentioned in and the subject of songs, loyal toasts, and salutes. "[[God Save the Queen]]" (or, alternatively, "God Save the King") is the British [[national anthem]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/NationalAnthem.aspx |title=Symbols of the Monarchy: National Anthem |accessdate=18 June 2010 |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902162152/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/NationalAnthem.aspx |archivedate=2 September 2014 }}</ref> [[Oath of allegiance|Oaths of allegiance]] are made to the Queen and her lawful successors.<ref>e.g. {{citation|url=http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/applying/ceremony/|title=Citizenship ceremonies|accessdate=10 October 2008|publisher=Home Office: UK Border Agency}}</ref>

The monarch takes little direct part in government. The decisions to exercise sovereign powers are delegated from the monarch, either by [[statute]] or by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], to [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]] or officers of [[the Crown]], or other [[public body|public bodies]], exclusive of the monarch personally. Thus the acts of state done in the name of the Crown, such as Crown Appointments,<ref>Crown Appointments Act 1661 c.6</ref> even if personally performed by the monarch, such as the [[Speech from the throne|Queen's Speech]] and the [[State Opening of Parliament]], depend upon decisions made elsewhere:
* Legislative power is exercised by the [[Queen-in-Parliament]], by and with the advice and consent of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].
* Executive power is exercised by [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]], which comprises [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]], primarily the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] and the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], which is technically a committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. They have the direction of the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces of the Crown]], [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|the Civil Service]] and other Crown Servants such as the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Services]] (the Queen receives certain foreign intelligence reports before the prime minister does<ref>"In London, the revelations from [1989 Soviet defector Vladimir] Pasechnik were summarized<!--As spelled in the original text--> into a quick note for the Joint Intelligence Committee. The first recipient of such reports is always Her Majesty, The Queen. The second is the prime minister, who at the time was [[Margaret Thatcher|[Margaret] Thatcher]]." Hoffman, David E. (Emanuel), ''The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy'' (N.Y.: Doubleday, 1st ed. [1st printing?] ({{ISBN|978-0-385-52437-7}}) 2009), p. 336 (author contributing editor & formerly U.S. White House, diplomatic, & Jerusalem correspondent, Moscow bureau chief, & foreign news asst. managing editor for [[Washington Post|''The Wash. Post'']]).</ref>).
* Judicial power is vested in the various [[judiciaries of the United Kingdom]], who by constitution and statute<ref>s3. Constitutional Reform Act 2005</ref> have [[judicial independence]] of the Government.
* The [[Church of England]], of which the monarch is the head, has its own legislative, judicial and executive structures.
* Powers independent of government are legally granted to other public bodies by statute or [[Statutory Instrument]] such as an [[Order in Council]], [[Royal Commission]] or otherwise.

The sovereign's role as a constitutional monarch is largely limited to non-partisan functions, such as granting [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]]. This role has been recognised since the 19th century. The constitutional writer [[Walter Bagehot]] identified the monarchy in 1867 as the "dignified part" rather than the "efficient part" of government.<ref>Bagehot, p. 9.</ref>

[[File:English Bill of Rights of 1689.jpg|left|thumb|The English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights of 1689]] curtailed the monarch's governmental power.]]

===Appointment of the prime minister===
Whenever necessary, the monarch is responsible for appointing a new prime minister (who by convention appoints and may dismiss every other [[Minister of the Crown]], and thereby constitutes and controls the government). In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the sovereign must appoint an individual who commands the support of the House of Commons, usually the leader of the party or coalition that has a majority in that House. The prime minister takes office by attending the monarch in private audience, and after "[[kissing hands]]" that appointment is immediately effective without any other formality or instrument.<ref>Brazier, p. 312.</ref>

In a [[hung parliament]] where no party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch has an increased degree of latitude in choosing the individual likely to command the most support, though it would usually be the leader of the largest party.<ref>Waldron, pp.59â€“60</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx|title=Queen and Prime Minister|accessdate=18 June 2010|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023100/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx|archive-date=14 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since 1945, there have only been three hung parliaments. The first followed the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] when [[Harold Wilson]] was appointed Prime Minister after [[Edward Heath]] resigned following his failure to form a coalition. Although Wilson's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|May 2010 general election]], in which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] (the largest party) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] (the third largest party) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II. The third occurred shortly thereafter, in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017]], when the Conservative Party lost its majority in a snap election, though the party remained in power as a minority government.

===Dissolution of Parliament===
In 1950 the King's [[Private Secretary]] [[Sir Alan Lascelles|Sir Alan "Tommy" Lascelles]], writing pseudonymously to ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, asserted a constitutional convention: according to the [[Lascelles Principles]], if a minority government asked to dissolve Parliament to call an early election to strengthen its position, the monarch could refuse, and would do so under three conditions. When Harold Wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974, the Queen granted his request as Heath had already failed to form a coalition. The [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|resulting general election]] gave Wilson a small majority.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge74b/results.htm|title=Results and analysis: General election, 10 October 1974|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=11 March 2008|publisher=Political Science Resources}}</ref> The monarch could in theory unilaterally dismiss the prime minister, but in practice the prime minister's term nowadays comes to an end only by electoral defeat, death, or resignation. The last monarch to remove the prime minister was [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], who dismissed [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] in 1834.<ref>Brock, Michael (September 2004; online edition, January 2008). "William IV (1765â€“1837)". ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. [[Oxford University Press]]. Retrieved 10 October 2008 (subscription required)</ref> The [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] removed the monarch's authority to dissolve Parliament; however the Act specifically retained the monarch's power of ''prorogation'', which is a regular [[Legislative session#United Kingdom|feature of the parliamentary calendar]].

===Royal prerogative===
{{Main|Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom}}
Some of the government's executive authority is theoretically and nominally vested in the sovereign and is known as the [[royal prerogative]]. The monarch acts within the constraints of convention and precedent, exercising prerogative only on the advice of ministers responsible to Parliament, often through the prime minister or [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].<ref name=parl>{{citation|author1=Durkin, Mary |author2=Gay, Oonagh |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03861.pdf|title=The Royal Prerogative|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=21 December 2005|publisher=House of Commons Library |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625170825/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03861.pdf |archivedate = 25 June 2008}}</ref> In practice, prerogative powers are exercised only on the prime minister's advice â€“ the prime minister, and not the sovereign, has control. The monarch holds a weekly audience with the prime minister; no records of these audiences are taken and the proceedings remain fully confidential.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Evening.aspx | title=The Queen's working day > Evening | accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> The monarch may express his or her views, but, as a constitutional ruler, must ultimately accept the decisions of prime minister and the Cabinet (providing they command the support of the House). In Bagehot's words: "the sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy&nbsp;... three rights â€“ the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn."<ref>Bagehot, p.75</ref>

Although the royal prerogative is extensive and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise, it is limited. Many Crown prerogatives have fallen out of use or have been permanently transferred to Parliament. For example, the monarch cannot impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. According to a parliamentary report, "The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers", and Parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation.<ref name=PASC>{{citation|title=PASC Publishes Government Defence of its Sweeping Prerogative Powers |publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |year=2002 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040104135404/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 January 2004 }}</ref>

The royal prerogative includes the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers, regulate the civil service, issue passports, declare war, make peace, direct the actions of the military, and negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The monarch is the [[Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces|Head of the Armed Forces]] (the [[Royal Navy]], the [[British Army]], and the [[Royal Air Force]]), and accredits British [[High Commissioner]]s and [[ambassador]]s, and receives [[Head of mission|heads of missions]] from foreign states.<ref name=PASC/>

It is the prerogative of the monarch to summon and [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]] Parliament. Each parliamentary session begins with the monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which the sovereign reads the [[Speech from the throne]] in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm |title=About Parliament: State Opening of Parliament |accessdate=27 April 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=UK Parliament |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021119091636/http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=19 November 2002 }}</ref> Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/6110930.stm|title=A Guide to Prorogation|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=7 November 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and is followed by a general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], but can be held sooner if the prime minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds of the members of the House of Commons vote to hold an early election.

Before a bill passed by the legislative Houses can become law, the [[royal assent]] (the monarch's approval) is required.<ref>Crabbe, p.17</ref> In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill law) or withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 assent has always been granted.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82104.stm|title=Royal Assent|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=24 January 2006|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

The monarch has a similar relationship with the [[devolution|devolved]] governments of Scotland, Wales, and [[Northern Ireland]]. The sovereign appoints the [[First Minister of Scotland]] on the nomination of the [[Scottish Parliament]],<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/345189.stm|title=UK Politics: Dewar appointed First Minister|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=17 May 1999|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> and the [[First Minister of Wales]] on the nomination of the [[Senedd Cymru â€“ Welsh Parliament|Senedd]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://new.wales.gov.uk/legislation/govwalesact2006/briefoverview?lang=en|title=Brief overview â€“ Government of Wales Act 2006|accessdate=30 August 2011|publisher=Welsh Assembly Government|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026023357/http://new.wales.gov.uk/legislation/govwalesact2006/briefoverview?lang=en|archivedate=26 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In Scottish matters, the sovereign acts on the advice of the [[Scottish Government]]. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters the sovereign acts on the advice of the prime minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The sovereign can veto any law passed by the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], if it is deemed unconstitutional by the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.uk-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980047_en_2 |title=Northern Ireland Act 1998|accessdate=10 October 2008|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information}}</ref>

The sovereign is deemed the "fount of justice"; although the sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases, judicial functions are performed in his or her name. For instance, prosecutions are brought on the monarch's behalf, and courts derive their authority from the Crown. The common law holds that the sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences. The [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] allows civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government), but not lawsuits against the monarch personally. The sovereign exercises the "prerogative of mercy", which is used to [[pardon]] convicted offenders or reduce sentences.<ref name=parl/><ref name=PASC/>

The monarch is the "[[fount of honour]]", the source of all honours and dignities in the United Kingdom. The Crown creates all [[peerage]]s, appoints members of the [[knight|orders of chivalry]], grants knighthoods and awards other honours.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/21/uk.freedomofinformation|title=Mystery lifted on Queen's powers|accessdate=9 May 2008|last=Dyer|first=Clare|date=21 October 2003|journal=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Although peerages and most other honours are granted on the advice of the prime minister, some honours are within the personal gift of the sovereign, and are not granted on ministerial advice. The monarch alone appoints members of the [[Order of the Garter]], the [[Order of the Thistle]], the [[Royal Victorian Order]] and the [[Order of Merit]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.honours.gov.uk/honours/chivalry.aspx |title=Orders of Chivalry |accessdate=9 May 2008 |date=30 April 2007 |publisher=The UK Honours System |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819024713/http://www.honours.gov.uk/honours/chivalry.aspx |archivedate=19 August 2007 }}</ref>

==History==

===English monarchy===
{{See also|List of English monarchs}}
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicts the Norman Conquest of 1066.]]
Following [[Vikings|Viking]] raids and settlement in the ninth century, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]] emerged as the dominant English kingdom. [[Alfred the Great]] secured Wessex, achieved dominance over western [[Mercia]], and assumed the title "King of the English".<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.12â€“13 and 31</ref> His grandson [[Ã†thelstan]] was the first king to rule over a unitary kingdom roughly corresponding to the present borders of England, though its constituent parts retained strong regional identities. The 11th century saw England become more stable, despite a number of wars with the Danes, which resulted in a Danish monarchy for one generation.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.13â€“17</ref> The [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] in 1066 by [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], was crucial in terms of both political and social change. The new monarch continued the centralisation of power begun in the Anglo-Saxon period, while the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] continued to develop.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.102â€“127</ref>

William was succeeded by two of his sons: [[William II of England|William II]], then [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. Henry made a controversial decision to name his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] (his only surviving child) as his heir. Following Henry's death in 1135, one of William I's grandsons, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]], laid claim to the throne and took power with the support of most of the [[Baron#Barons in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|barons]]. Matilda challenged his reign; as a result, England descended into a period of disorder known as [[the Anarchy]]. Stephen maintained a precarious hold on power but agreed to a compromise under which Matilda's son [[Henry II of England|Henry]] would succeed him. Henry accordingly became the first [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin king of England]] and the first monarch of the [[Plantagenet dynasty]] as Henry II in 1154.<ref>Fraser, pp.30â€“46</ref>

The reigns of most of the Angevin monarchs were marred by civil strife and conflicts between the monarch and the nobility. Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, the future monarchs [[Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]]. Nevertheless, Henry managed to expand his kingdom, forming what is retrospectively known as the [[Angevin Empire]]. Upon Henry's death, his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne; he was absent from England for most of his reign, as he left to fight in the [[Crusades]]. He was killed besieging a castle, and John succeeded him.

John's reign was marked by conflict with the barons, particularly over the limits of royal power. In 1215, the barons coerced the king into issuing [[Magna Carta]] ([[Latin]] for "Great Charter") to guarantee the rights and liberties of the nobility. Soon afterwards, further disagreements plunged England into a civil war known as the [[First Barons' War]]. The war came to an abrupt end after John died in 1216, leaving the Crown to his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Fraser, pp.54â€“74</ref> Later in Henry's reign, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] led the barons in another rebellion, beginning the [[Second Barons' War]]. The war ended in a clear royalist victory and in the death of many rebels, but not before the king had agreed to summon a parliament in 1265.<ref>Fraser, pp.77â€“78</ref>

The next monarch, [[Edward Longshanks]], was far more successful in maintaining royal power and responsible for the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest of Wales]]. He attempted to establish English domination of Scotland. However, gains in Scotland were reversed during the reign of his successor, [[Edward II]], who also faced conflict with the nobility.<ref>Fraser, pp.79â€“93</ref> In 1311, Edward II was forced to relinquish many of his powers to a committee of [[Ordinances of 1311|baronial "ordainers"]]; however, military victories helped him regain control in 1322.<ref>Ashley, pp.595â€“597</ref> Nevertheless, in 1327, Edward was deposed by his wife [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. His 14-year-old son became [[Edward III]]. Edward III claimed the French Crown, setting off the [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France.

His campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all the gains had been lost. Edward's reign was also marked by the further development of Parliament, which came to be divided into two Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson [[Richard II]]. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin [[Henry Bolingbroke]] seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.<ref>Fraser, pp.96â€“115</ref>

Henry IV was the grandson of Edward III and the son of [[John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]]; hence, his dynasty was known as the [[House of Lancaster]]. For most of his reign, Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son, the future [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Henry V's own reign, which began in 1413, was largely free from domestic strife, leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years' War in France. Although he was victorious, his sudden death in 1422 left his infant son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] on the throne and gave the French an opportunity to overthrow English rule.<ref>Fraser, pp.118â€“130</ref>

The unpopularity of Henry VI's counsellors and his unjustly hated consort, [[Margaret of Anjou]], as well as his own ineffectual leadership, led to the weakening of the House of Lancaster. The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York, so called because its head, a descendant of Edward III, was [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] was at odds with the Queen. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son, [[Edward IV]], led the Yorkists to victory in 1461, overthrowing Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou. Edward IV constantly was at odds with the Lancastrians, and his own councilors after his marriage to [[Elizabeth Woodville]], with a brief return to power for Henry VI. Edward IV prevailed, winning back the throne at [[Barnet]] and slaying the Lancastrian heir, [[Edward of Westminster]] at [[Tewkesbury]]. After, he captured Margaret of Anjou, eventually sending her into exile, but not before killing Henry VI while he was held prisoner in the Tower. The [[Wars of the Roses]], nevertheless, continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son [[Edward V]] and brother [[Richard III]]. Edward V disappeared, presumably murdered by Richard. Ultimately, the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch led by [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], in 1485, when Richard III was killed in the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]].<ref>Fraser, pp.133â€“165</ref>

Now King Henry VII, he neutralised the remaining Yorkist forces, partly by marrying [[Elizabeth of York]], a Yorkist heir. Through skill and ability, Henry re-established absolute supremacy in the realm, and the conflicts with the nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, p.295; Fraser, pp.168â€“176</ref> The reign of the second Tudor king, [[Henry VIII]], was one of great political change. Religious upheaval and disputes with the [[Pope]], and the fact that his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]] only birthed a daughter, led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the [[Church of England]] (the Anglican Church) and divorce his wife to marry [[Anne Boleyn]].<ref>Fraser, pp.179â€“189</ref>

Wales â€“ which had been conquered centuries earlier, but had remained a separate dominion â€“ was annexed to England under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]].<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.194, 265, 309</ref> Henry VIII's son and successor, the young [[Edward VI]], continued with further religious reforms, but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis. He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] to succeed, and therefore drew up a will designating [[Lady Jane Grey]] as his heiress. Jane's reign, however, lasted only nine days; with tremendous popular support, Mary deposed her and declared herself the lawful sovereign. Mary I married [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], who was declared king and co-ruler. He pursued disastrous wars in France and she attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism (burning Protestants at the stake as heretics in the process). Upon her death in 1558, the pair were succeeded by her Protestant half-sister [[Elizabeth I]]. England returned to [[Protestantism]] and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring the New World.<ref>Ashley, pp.636â€“647 and Fraser, pp.190â€“211</ref>

===Scottish monarchy===
{{See also|List of Scottish monarchs}}
In Scotland, as in England, monarchies emerged after the withdrawal of the Roman empire from Britain in the early fifth century. The three groups that lived in Scotland at this time were the [[Picts]] in the north east, the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] in the south, including the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], and the [[Gaels]] or [[Scoti|Scotti]] (who would later give their name to Scotland), of the Irish petty kingdom of [[DÃ¡l Riata]] in the west. [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] is traditionally viewed as the first king of a united Scotland (known as Scotia to writers in Latin, or [[kingdom of Alba|Alba]] to the Scots).<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.1â€“12, 35</ref> The expansion of Scottish dominions continued over the next two centuries, as other territories such as Strathclyde were absorbed.

Early Scottish monarchs did not inherit the Crown directly; instead the custom of [[tanistry]] was followed, where the monarchy alternated between different branches of the [[House of Alpin]]. As a result, however, the rival dynastic lines clashed, often violently. From 942 to 1005, seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle.<ref>Weir, pp.164â€“177</ref> In 1005, [[Malcolm II]] ascended the throne having killed many rivals. He continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition, and when he died in 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson, [[Duncan I]], instead of a cousin, as had been usual. In 1040, Duncan suffered defeat in battle at the hands of [[Macbeth, King of Scotland|Macbeth]], who was killed himself in 1057 by Duncan's son [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm]]. The following year, after killing Macbeth's stepson [[Lulach]], Malcolm ascended the throne as Malcolm III.<ref>Ashley, pp.390â€“395</ref>

With a further series of battles and deposings, five of Malcolm's sons as well as one of his brothers successively became king. Eventually, the Crown came to his youngest son, [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. David was succeeded by his grandsons [[Malcolm IV]], and then by [[William the Lion]], the longest-reigning King of Scots before the [[Union of the Crowns]].<ref>Ashley, pp.400â€“407 and Weir, pp.185â€“198</ref> William participated in a rebellion against King Henry II of England but when the rebellion failed, William was captured by the English. In exchange for his release, William was forced to acknowledge Henry as his feudal overlord. The English King Richard I agreed to terminate the arrangement in 1189, in return for a large sum of money needed for the Crusades.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, p.170</ref> William died in 1214, and was succeeded by his son [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]]. Alexander II, as well as his successor [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], attempted to take over the [[Western Isles]], which were still under the overlordship of Norway. During the reign of Alexander III, Norway launched an unsuccessful invasion of Scotland; the ensuing [[Treaty of Perth]] recognised Scottish control of the Western Isles and other disputed areas.<ref>Ashley, pp.407â€“409 and Cannon and Griffiths, pp.187, 196</ref>

Alexander III's unexpected death in a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander's three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]]. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|13 rival claimants to the throne]]. A court was set up and after two years of deliberation, it pronounced [[John Balliol]] to be king. Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], Scotland had no monarch, until [[Robert the Bruce]] declared himself king in 1306.<ref>Ashley, pp.409â€“412</ref>

Robert's efforts to control Scotland culminated in success, and Scottish independence was acknowledged in 1328. However, only one year later, Robert died and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, [[David II of Scotland|David II]]. On the pretext of restoring John Balliol's rightful heir, [[Edward Balliol]], the English again invaded in 1332. During the next four years, Balliol was crowned, deposed, restored, deposed, restored, and deposed until he eventually settled in England, and David remained king for the next 35 years.<ref>Ashley, pp.549â€“552</ref>

David II died childless in 1371 and was succeeded by his nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] of the [[House of Stuart]]. The reigns of both Robert II and his successor, [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]], were marked by a general decline in royal power. When Robert III died in 1406, [[regent]]s had to rule the country; the monarch, Robert III's son [[James I of Scotland|James I]], had been taken captive by the English. Having paid a large ransom, James returned to Scotland in 1424; to restore his authority, he used ruthless measures, including the execution of several of his enemies. He was assassinated by a group of nobles. [[James II of Scotland|James II]] continued his father's policies by subduing influential noblemen but he was killed in an accident at the age of thirty, and a council of regents again assumed power. [[James III of Scotland|James III]] was defeated in a battle against rebellious Scottish earls in 1488, leading to another boy-king: [[James IV]].<ref>Ashley, pp.552â€“565</ref>

In 1513 James IV launched an invasion of England, attempting to take advantage of the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden Field]]; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, [[James V]], was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]]. Once again, a regency was established.

Mary, a Roman Catholic, reigned during a period of great religious upheaval in Scotland. As a result of the efforts of reformers such as [[John Knox]], a Protestant ascendancy was established. Mary caused alarm by marrying her Catholic cousin, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], in 1565. After Lord Darnley's assassination in 1567, Mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of Darnley's murder. The nobility rebelled against the Queen, forcing her to abdicate. She fled to England, and the Crown went to her infant son [[James VI]], who was brought up as a Protestant. Mary was imprisoned and later executed by the English queen Elizabeth I.<ref>Ashley, pp.567â€“575</ref>

===Personal union and republican phase===
[[File:JamesIEngland.jpg|thumb|right|In 1603 James VI and I became the first monarch to rule over England, Scotland, and Ireland together.]]
Elizabeth I's death in 1603 ended Tudor rule in England. Since she had no children, she was succeeded by the Scottish monarch [[James VI]], who was the great-grandson of [[Henry VIII]]'s older sister and hence Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed. James VI ruled in England as James I after what was known as the "[[Union of the Crowns]]". Although England and Scotland were in [[personal union]] under one monarch â€“ James I became the first monarch to style himself "King of Great Britain" in 1604<ref>Royal Arms, Styles, and Titles of Great Britain: Westminster, 20 October 1604</ref> â€“ they remained two separate kingdoms. James I's successor, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], experienced frequent conflicts with the English Parliament related to the issue of royal and parliamentary powers, especially the power to impose taxes. He provoked opposition by ruling without Parliament from 1629 to 1640, unilaterally levying taxes and adopting controversial religious policies (many of which were offensive to the Scottish [[Presbyterians]] and the English [[Puritans]]). His attempt to enforce [[Anglicanism]] led to organised rebellion in Scotland (the "[[Bishops' Wars]]") and ignited the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In 1642, the conflict between the King and English Parliament reached its climax and the [[English Civil War]] began.<ref>Fraser, pp.214â€“231</ref>

The Civil War culminated in the execution of the king in 1649, the overthrow of the English monarchy, and the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of England]]. Charles I's son, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was proclaimed King of Great Britain in Scotland, but he was forced to flee abroad after he invaded England and was defeated at the [[Battle of Worcester]]. In 1653, [[Oliver Cromwell]], the most prominent military and political leader in the nation, seized power and declared himself [[Lord Protector]] (effectively becoming a military dictator, but refusing the title of king). Cromwell ruled until his death in 1658, when he was succeeded by his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]]. The new Lord Protector had little interest in governing; he soon resigned.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.393â€“400</ref> The lack of clear leadership led to civil and military unrest, and for a popular desire to restore the monarchy. In 1660, the [[Restoration (England)|monarchy was restored]] and Charles II returned to Britain.<ref>Fraser, p.232</ref>

Charles II's reign was marked by the development of the first modern political parties in England. Charles had no legitimate children, and was due to be succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]]. A parliamentary effort to exclude James from the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] arose; the "Petitioners", who supported exclusion, became the Whig Party, whereas the "Abhorrers", who opposed exclusion, became the Tory Party. The Exclusion Bill failed; on several occasions, Charles II dissolved Parliament because he feared that the bill might pass. After the dissolution of the Parliament of 1681, Charles ruled without a Parliament until his death in 1685. When James succeeded Charles, he pursued a policy of offering religious tolerance to Roman Catholics, thereby drawing the ire of many of his Protestant subjects. Many opposed James's decisions to maintain a large standing army, to appoint Roman Catholics to high political and military offices, and to imprison [[Seven Bishops|Church of England clerics who challenged his policies]]. As a result, a group of Protestants known as the [[Immortal Seven]] invited James II's daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband [[William III of Orange]] to depose the king. William obliged, arriving in England on 5 November 1688 to great public support. Faced with the defection of many of his Protestant officials, James fled the realm and William and Mary (rather than [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James II's Catholic son]]) were declared joint Sovereigns of England, Scotland and Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.242â€“245</ref>

James's overthrow, known as the [[Glorious Revolution]], was one of the most important events in the long evolution of parliamentary power. The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] affirmed parliamentary supremacy, and declared that the English people held certain rights, including the freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent. The Bill of Rights required future monarchs to be Protestants, and provided that, after any children of William and Mary, Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] would inherit the Crown. Mary died childless in 1694, leaving William as the sole monarch. By 1700, a political crisis arose, as all of Anne's children had died, leaving her as the only individual left in the line of succession. Parliament was afraid that the former James II or his supporters, known as [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], might attempt to reclaim the throne. Parliament passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded James and his Catholic relations from the succession and made William's nearest Protestant relations, the family of [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], next in line to the throne after his sister-in-law Anne.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.439â€“440</ref> Soon after the passage of the Act, William III died, leaving the Crown to Anne.

===After the 1707 Acts of Union===
[[File:Anniex.jpg|thumb|right|England and Scotland were united as Great Britain under Queen Anne in 1707.]]
{{See also|List of British monarchs}}
After Anne's accession, the problem of the succession re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia's family as the next heirs, passed the [[Act of Security 1704]], threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the [[Alien Act 1705]], threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the [[Acts of Union 1707]], under which England and Scotland were united into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.447â€“448</ref>

In 1714, Queen Anne was succeeded by her second cousin, and Sophia's son, [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[Elector of Hanover]], who consolidated his position by defeating Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719. The new monarch was less active in government than many of his British predecessors, but retained control over his German kingdoms, with which Britain was now in personal union.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.460â€“469</ref> Power shifted towards George's ministers, especially to Sir [[Robert Walpole]], who is often considered the first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]], although the title was not then in use.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/walpole_robert.shtml|title=Sir Robert Walpole|accessdate=14 October 2008|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The next monarch, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], witnessed the final end of the Jacobite threat in 1746, when the Catholic Stuarts were completely defeated. During the long reign of his grandson, [[George III]], Britain's American colonies were lost, the former colonies having formed the [[United States|United States of America]], but British influence elsewhere in the world continued to grow, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was created by the [[Acts of Union 1800]].<ref>Ashley, pp.677â€“680</ref>

[[File:George III of the United Kingdom-e.jpg|right|thumb|The union of Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom occurred in 1801 during the reign of King George III.]]
From 1811 to 1820, George III suffered a severe bout of what is now believed to be [[porphyria]], an illness rendering him incapable of ruling. His son, the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], ruled in his stead as [[Regent of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]. During [[Regency era|the Regency]] and his own reign, the power of the monarchy declined, and by the time of his successor, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], the monarch was no longer able to effectively interfere with parliamentary power. In 1834, William dismissed the Whig Prime Minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne]], and appointed a Tory, Sir [[Robert Peel]]. In the ensuing elections, however, Peel lost. The king had no choice but to recall Lord Melbourne. During William IV's reign, the [[Reform Act 1832]], which reformed parliamentary representation, was passed. Together with others passed later in the century, the Act led to an expansion of the electoral franchise and the rise of the House of Commons as the most important branch of Parliament.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.530â€“550</ref>

The final transition to a [[constitutional monarchy]] was made during the long reign of William IV's successor, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]. As a woman, Victoria could not rule [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], which only permitted succession in the male line, so the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover came to an end. The [[Victorian era]] was marked by great cultural change, technological progress, and the establishment of the United Kingdom as one of the world's foremost powers. In recognition of [[British Raj|British rule over India]], Victoria was declared [[Empress of India]] in 1876. However, her reign was also marked by increased support for the [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican movement]], due in part to Victoria's permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|her husband]] in 1861.<ref>Fraser, pp.305â€“306</ref>

Victoria's son, [[Edward VII]], became the first monarch of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in 1901. In 1917, the next monarch, [[George V]], changed "Saxe-Coburg and Gotha" to "[[House of Windsor|Windsor]]" in response to the anti-German sympathies aroused by the [[World War I|First World War]]. George V's reign was marked by the separation of Ireland into Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom, and the [[Irish Free State]], an independent nation, in 1922.<ref>Fraser, pp.314â€“333</ref>

===Shared monarchy===
[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|right|Map of the British Empire in 1921]]
[[File:Commonwealth realms map.svg|thumb|right|{{legend|#000080|Current Commonwealth realms}}{{legend|#5961e6|Territories, dependencies and associated states of current realms}}{{legend|#800000|Former Commonwealth realms and Dominions that are now republics}}]]
During the twentieth century, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] evolved from the [[British Empire]]. Prior to 1926, the British Crown reigned over the British Empire collectively; the [[Dominion]]s and [[Crown Colonies]] were subordinate to the United Kingdom. The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] gave complete self-government to the Dominions, effectively creating a system whereby a single monarch operated independently in each separate Dominion. The concept was solidified by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]],<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/westmins.htm|title=Statute of Westminster 1931|accessdate=20 April 2008|date=11 October 2001|publisher=Government of Nova Scotia}}</ref> which has been likened to "a treaty among the Commonwealth countries".<ref>Justice Rouleau in [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html O'Donohue v. Canada], 2003 CanLII 41404 (ON S.C.)</ref>

The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it is often still referred to as "British" for legal and historical reasons and for convenience. The monarch became separately monarch of the United Kingdom, [[monarch of Canada]], [[monarch of Australia]], and so forth. The independent states within the Commonwealth would share the same monarch in a relationship likened to a [[personal union]].<ref>Zines, Leslie (2008).

George V's death in 1936 was followed by the accession of [[Edward VIII]], who caused a public scandal by announcing his desire to marry the divorced American [[Wallis Simpson]], even though the Church of England opposed the remarriage of divorcees. Accordingly, Edward announced his intention to [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicate]]; the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth countries granted his request. Edward VIII and any children by his new wife were excluded from the line of succession, and the Crown went to his brother, [[George VI]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31061|title=Edward VIII|accessdate=20 April 2008|last=Matthew|first=H.

At first, every member of the Commonwealth retained the same monarch as the United Kingdom, but when the Dominion of India became a republic in 1950, it would no longer share in a common monarchy. Instead, the British monarch was acknowledged as "[[Head of the Commonwealth]]" in all Commonwealth member states, whether they were realms or republics. The position is purely ceremonial, and is not inherited by the British monarch as of right but is vested in an individual chosen by the Commonwealth heads of government.<ref name="Boyce">{{cite book |last1=Boyce |first1=Peter John |title=The Queen's Other Realms: The Crown and Its Legacy in Australia, Canada and New Zealand |date=2008 |publisher=Federation Press |isbn=9781862877009 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kY-Tk0-quyoC&pg=PA41 |accessdate=31 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=hoc>{{citation|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/150757/head_of_the_commonwealth/ |title=Head of the Commonwealth |accessdate=26 September 2008 |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706045334/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/150757/head_of_the_commonwealth/ |archivedate=6 July 2010 }}</ref> Member states of the Commonwealth that share the same person as monarch are informally known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s.<ref name="Boyce"/>

===Monarchy in Ireland===
{{See also|Monarchy of Ireland}}
In 1155 the only English pope, [[Adrian IV]], authorised King [[Henry II of England]] to take possession of Ireland as a feudal territory nominally under papal overlordship. The pope wanted the English monarch to annex Ireland and bring the Irish church into line with Rome, despite this process already underway in Ireland by 1155.<ref>{{cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/173|title=Adrian IV|accessdate=20 April 2008|last=Sayer|first=Jane E.|date=September 2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/173}} (Subscription required)</ref> An all-island kingship of Ireland had been created in 854 by [[MÃ¡el Sechnaill mac MÃ¡ele Ruanaid]]. His last successor was [[RuaidrÃ­ Ua Conchobair]], who had become King of Ireland in early 1166, and exiled [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], King of Leinster. Diarmait asked Henry II for help, gaining a group of Anglo-Norman aristocrats and adventurers, led by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], to help him regain his throne. Diarmait and his Anglo-Norman allies succeeded and he became King of Leinster again. De Clare married Diarmait's daughter, and when Diarmait died in 1171, de Clare became King of Leinster.<ref>{{cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17697|title=Dermot MacMurrough|accessdate=20 April 2008|last=Flanagan|first=M.

By 1541, King Henry VIII of England had broken with the Church of Rome and declared himself [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. The pope's grant of Ireland to the English monarch became invalid, so Henry summoned a meeting of the Irish Parliament to change his title from Lord of Ireland to King of Ireland.<ref>{{cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12955|title=Henry VIII|accessdate=20 April 2008|last=Ives|first=E.

In 1800, as a result of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], the Act of Union merged the kingdom of Great Britain and the kingdom of Ireland into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The whole island of Ireland continued to be a part of the United Kingdom until 1922, when what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] won independence as the [[Irish Free State]], a separate Dominion within the Commonwealth. The Irish Free State was renamed [[Ã‰ire]] (or "Ireland") in 1937, and in 1949 declared itself a republic, left the Commonwealth and severed all ties with the monarchy. [[Northern Ireland]] remained within the Union. In 1927, the United Kingdom changed its name to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, while the monarch's style for the next twenty years became "of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India".

In the 1990s, [[republicanism in the United Kingdom]] grew, partly on account of negative publicity associated with the Royal Family (for instance, immediately following the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]).<ref>{{citation|url=http://britannia.com/diana/article5.html|title=Can the Windsors survive Diana's death?|accessdate=20 April 2008|last=Seely|first=Robert|date=5 September 1997|publisher=Britannia Internet Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410095151/http://www.britannia.com/diana/article5.html|archive-date=10 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, polls from 2002 to 2007 showed that around 70â€“80% of the British public supported the continuation of the monarchy.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/poll-reveals-big-rise-in-support-for-monarchy-656892.html|title=Polls reveal big rise in support for monarchy|accessdate=20 April 2008|last=Grice|first=Andrew|date=9 April 2002|journal=[[The Independent]]}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/378/Monarchy-Poll-April-2006.aspx|title= Monarchy poll|date=April 2006|publisher=[[Ipsos MORI]]|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://populuslimited.com/uploads/download_pdf-160108-The-Discovery-Channel-Monarchy-Survey.pdf |title=Monarchy Survey |publisher=[[Populus Ltd]] |page=9 |date=14â€“16 December 2007 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511201056/http://populuslimited.com/uploads/download_pdf-160108-The-Discovery-Channel-Monarchy-Survey.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7162649.stm|title=Poll respondents back UK monarchy|publisher=BBC|date=28 December 2007|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> This support has remained constant since thenâ€”according to a 2018 survey, a majority of the British public across all age groups still support the monarchy's continuation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/863893/support-for-the-monarchy-in-britain-by-age/|title=Support for the monarchy in Britain by age 2018 survey|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>

==Religious role==
The sovereign is the [[supreme governor]] of the [[Established church|established]] [[Church of England]]. Archbishops and bishops are appointed by the monarch, on the advice of the prime minister, who chooses the appointee from a list of nominees prepared by a Church Commission. The Crown's role in the Church of England is titular; the most senior clergyman, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], is the spiritual leader of the Church and of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandChurch/QueenandtheChurchofEngland.aspx  |title=Queen and the Church of England |accessdate=18 June 2010 |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202214246/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandChurch/QueenandtheChurchofEngland.aspx |archivedate=2 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/105|title=Roles and Responsibilities: Overview|accessdate=9 October 2008|publisher=The Archbishop of Canterbury|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803121437/http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/105|archivedate=3 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The monarch takes an oath to preserve the [[Church of Scotland]] and he or she holds the power to appoint the [[Lord High Commissioner]] to the Church's [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]], but otherwise plays no part in its governance, and exerts no powers over it.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandChurch/QueenandtheChurchofScotland.aspx |title=Queen and Church of Scotland |accessdate=18 June 2010 |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202215833/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandChurch/QueenandtheChurchofScotland.aspx |archivedate=2 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{citation|url = http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/organisation/orgqueen.htm|title = Queen, State and Kirk|publisher = Church of Scotland official website| accessdate =10 May 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090417112432/http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/organisation/orgqueen.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate = 17 April 2009}}</ref> The sovereign plays no formal role in the disestablished [[Church in Wales]] or [[Church of Ireland]].

==Succession==
{{Main|Succession to the British throne|Coronation of the British monarch}}
The relationship between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the laws governing succession to the shared throne requires the unanimous consent of all the realms. Succession is governed by statutes such as the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the [[Acts of Union 1707]]. The rules of succession may only be changed by an [[Act of Parliament]]; it is not possible for an individual to renounce his or her right of succession. The Act of Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover]] (1630â€“1714), a granddaughter of [[James VI and I|James I]].

Upon the death of a sovereign, their heir immediately and automatically succeeds (hence the phrase "[[The king is dead, long live the king!]]"), and the accession of the new sovereign is publicly proclaimed by an [[Accession Council]] that meets at [[St James's Palace]].<ref name=accessioncouncil>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Accession/Accession.aspx |title=Accession |accessdate=14 May 2009 |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531055207/http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Accession/Accession.aspx |archivedate=31 May 2015 }}</ref> Upon their accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths: the [[Accession Declaration]] as first required by the Bill of Rights, and an oath that they will "maintain and preserve" the Church of Scotland settlement as required by the Act of Union. The monarch is usually [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], normally by the Archbishop of Canterbury. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; indeed, the ceremony usually takes place many months after accession to allow sufficient time for its preparation and for a period of mourning.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Coronation/Coronation.aspx|title=Coronation|accessdate=14 May 2009|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref>

When an individual ascends the throne, it is expected they will reign until death. The only voluntary abdication, that of [[Edward VIII]], had to be authorised by a special Act of Parliament, [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]. The last monarch involuntarily removed from power was [[James VII and II]], who fled into exile in 1688 during the [[Glorious Revolution]].

===Restrictions by gender and religion===
{{See also|Succession to the Crown Act 2013}}
Succession was largely governed by [[primogeniture|male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], under which sons inherit before daughters, and elder children inherit before younger ones of the same gender. The British prime minister, [[David Cameron]], announced at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011]] that all 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s, including the United Kingdom, had agreed to abolish the gender-preference rule for anyone born after the date of the meeting, 28 October 2011.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607|title=Girls Equal in British throne succession|accessdate=28 October 2011|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=28 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News}}</ref> They also agreed that future monarchs would no longer be prohibited from marrying a Roman Catholic â€“ a law which dated from the Act of Settlement 1701. However, since the monarch is also the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], the laws which restrict the throne to Protestants remain.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1565212|title=Act of Settlement 1700(c.2), Article II|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=2078408|title=Union with Scotland Act 1706 (c.11), Article II|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1519715|title=Union with England Act 1707 (c.7), Article II|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> The necessary UK legislation making the changes received the royal assent on 25 April 2013 and was brought into force in March 2015 after the equivalent legislation was approved in all the other Commonwealth realms.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2013-07-22/baby-destined-to-become-a-monarch/ |title=Baby destined to become a monarch |date=22 July 2013 |publisher=ITV News |accessdate=7 November 2013}}</ref>

Though Catholics are prohibited from succeeding and are deemed "naturally dead" for succession purposes, the disqualification does not extend to the individual's legitimate Protestant descendants.

===Regency===
{{Main|Regency Acts|Counsellor of State}}
The [[Regency Acts]] allow for regencies in the event of a monarch who is a minor or who is physically or mentally incapacitated. When a regency is necessary, the next qualified individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] (the Queen's husband) could act as regent in these circumstances.<ref name=regact53>{{citation|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1121879|title=Regency Act 1953|accessdate=9 October 2008|publisher=Ministry of Justice}}</ref> Since reaching adulthood (in November 1966), [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], has been first in line for the regency.

During a temporary physical infirmity or an absence from the kingdom, the sovereign may temporarily delegate some of his or her functions to [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]], the monarch's spouse and the first four adults in the line of succession. The present Counsellors of State are: the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]] and the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke of York]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/CounsellorsofState.aspx|title=Queen and Government: Counsellors of State|accessdate=18 June 2010|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref>

==Finances==
{{Main|Finances of the British royal family}}
Until 1760 the monarch met all official expenses from hereditary revenues, which included the profits of the [[Crown Estate]] (the royal property portfolio). [[King George III]] agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown in return for the [[Civil list#United Kingdom|Civil List]], and this arrangement persisted until 2012. An annual Property Services [[grant-in-aid]] paid for the upkeep of the royal residences, and an annual Royal Travel Grant-in-Aid paid for travel. The Civil List covered most expenses, including those for staffing, state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment. Its size was fixed by Parliament every 10 years; any money saved was carried forward to the next 10-year period.<ref name=cl>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Royalfinances/Sourcesoffunding/TheCivilList.aspx|title=Royal Finances: The Civil List|publisher=Official web site of the British Monarchy|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> From 2012 until 2020, the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid are to be replaced with a single [[Sovereign Grant]], which will be set at 15% of the revenues generated by the Crown Estate.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15345351|publisher=BBC|title=Royal funding changes become law|date=18 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News}}</ref>

Like the Crown Estate, the land and assets of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], a property portfolio valued at Â£383&nbsp;million in 2011,<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.duchyoflancaster.com/management-and-finance-2/accounts-annual-reports-and-investments/|title=Accounts, Annual Reports and Investments|publisher=Duchy of Lancaster|date=18 July 2011|accessdate=18 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012094537/http://www.duchyoflancaster.com/management-and-finance-2/accounts-annual-reports-and-investments/|archivedate=12 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> are held in trust.

The sovereign is subject to indirect taxes such as [[Value-added tax (United Kingdom)|value-added tax]], and since 1993 the Queen has paid [[income tax]] and [[capital gains tax]] on personal income. Parliamentary grants to the sovereign are not treated as income as they are solely for official expenditure.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Royalfinances/Taxation.aspx|title=Royal Finances: Taxation|publisher=Official web site of the British Monarchy|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> Republicans estimate that the real cost of the monarchy, including security and potential income not claimed by the state, such as profits from the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall and rent of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, is Â£334 million a year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal finances|url=https://republic.org.uk/what-we-want/royal-finances|website=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|accessdate=20 August 2015|date=2012-12-30}}</ref>

Estimates of the Queen's wealth vary, depending on whether assets owned by her personally or held in trust for the nation are included. ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated her wealth at US$450&nbsp;million in 2010,<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/07/07/richest-royals-wealth-monarch-wedding-divorce-billionaire.html|title=The World's Richest Royals|work=Forbes|author=Serafin, Tatiana|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref> but no official figure is available.

Historically, the [[Palace of Westminster]] and the [[Tower of London]] were the main residences of the English Sovereign until Henry VIII acquired the [[Palace of Whitehall]]. Whitehall was destroyed by fire in 1698, leading to a shift to [[St James's Palace]]. Although replaced as the monarch's primary London residence by Buckingham Palace in 1837, St James's is still the senior palace<ref name="StJamessPalace">{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/StJamessPalace.aspx |title=Royal Residences: St. James's Palace|accessdate=14 July 2009|work=Official website of the British Monarchy|publisher=The Royal Household}}</ref> and remains the ceremonial Royal residence.

The sovereign is known as "His Majesty" or "Her Majesty". The form "[[Britannic Majesty]]" appears in international treaties and on [[British passport|passports]] to differentiate the British monarch from foreign rulers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Passports |url=https://www.royal.uk/passports |publisher= Official web site of the British Monarch |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en |date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Thorpe |first1=Robert |title=A commentary on the treatises entered into between his Britannic majesty, and his most faithful majesty ... his catholic majesty ... and ... the king of the Netherlands ... for the purpose of preventing their subjects from engaging in any illicit traffic in slaves |date=1819 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0cVAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP1 |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The monarch chooses his or her [[regnal name]], not necessarily his or her first name â€“ [[George VI]], [[Edward VII]] and [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] did not use their first names.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Panton |first1=James |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy |date=2011 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810874978 |page=392 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BiyyueBTpaMC&pg=PA392 |accessdate=31 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

If only one monarch has used a particular name, no [[Regnal number|ordinal]] is used; for example, Queen Victoria is not known as "Victoria I", and ordinals are not used for English monarchs who reigned before the Norman conquest of England. The question of whether numbering for British monarchs is based on previous English or Scottish monarchs was raised in 1953 when Scottish nationalists challenged the Queen's use of "Elizabeth II", on the grounds that there had never been an "Elizabeth I" in Scotland. In ''[[MacCormick v Lord Advocate]]'', the Scottish [[Court of Session]] ruled against the plaintiffs, finding that the Queen's title was a matter of her own choice and prerogative. The Home Secretary told the House of Commons that monarchs since the Acts of Union had consistently used the higher of the English and Scottish ordinals, which in the applicable four cases has been the English ordinal.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1953/mar/03/royal-titles-bill Royal Titles Bill].

==Arms==
{{Main|Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom}}
The [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] are "Quarterly, I and IV Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or [for England]; II Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules [for Scotland]; III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent [for Ireland]". The supporters are [[the Lion and the Unicorn]]; the motto is "[[Dieu et mon droit]]" (French: "God and my Right"). Surrounding the shield is a representation of a [[Garter (stockings)|Garter]] bearing the motto of the [[Chivalric order]] of the same name; "[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]". ([[Old French]]: "Shame be to him who thinks evil of it"). In Scotland, the monarch uses an alternative form of the arms in which quarters I and IV represent Scotland, II England, and III Ireland. The mottoes are "In Defens" (an abbreviated form of the [[Scots language|Scots]] "[[In My Defens God Me Defend]]") and the motto of the [[Order of the Thistle]], "[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]" ([[Latin]]: "No-one provokes me with impunity"); the supporters are the unicorn and lion, who support both the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and [[lance]]s, from which fly the flags of [[flag of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[flag of England|England]].
