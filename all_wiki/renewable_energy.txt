'''Renewable energy''' is energy that is collected from [[renewable resource]]s, which are naturally replenished on a [[Orders of magnitude (time)|human timescale]], including [[carbon neutral]] sources like [[sunlight]], [[wind power|wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal power|tides]], [[wave power|waves]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ellabban | first1 = Omar | last2 = Abu-Rub | first2 = Haitham | last3 = Blaabjerg | first3 = Frede | year = 2014 | title = Renewable energy resources: Current status, future prospects and their enabling technology | journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 39 | pages = 748–764 [749] | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.113 }}</ref> The term often also encompasses [[biomass]] as well, whose carbon neutral status is under debate. <ref name="CarbonBrief1">{{cite web |url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/biomass-subsidies-not-fit-for-purpose-chatham-house|title=Biomass subsidies 'not fit for purpose', says Chatham House|author=JOCELYN TIMPERLEY|date=23 February 2017|publisher=Carbon Brief Ltd © 2020 - Company No. 07222041|accessdate=31 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="SciAm">{{cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/congress-says-biomass-is-carbon-neutral-but-scientists-disagree/|title=Congress Says Biomass Is Carbon Neutral but Scientists Disagree - Using wood as fuel source could actually increase CO2 emissions|last1=Harvey|first1=Chelsea|last2= Heikkinen|first2=Niina|date=23 March 2018|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=31 October 2020}}</ref>

Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: [[electricity generation]], [[space heating|air]] and [[water heating]]/[[air conditioning|cooling]], [[transportation]], and [[Stand-alone power system|rural (off-grid)]] energy services.<ref name=ren15>{{cite web|title=Renewables 2010 Global Status Report|url=https://www.harbortaxgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/REN21_GSR_2010_full_revised-Sept2010.pdf|publisher=REN21|date=September 2010|accessdate=27 October 2019}}</ref>

Based on [[REN21]]'s 2017 report, renewables contributed 19.3% to humans' [[World energy consumption|global energy consumption]] and 24.5% to their generation of electricity in 2015 and 2016, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 8.9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (modern biomass, geothermal and solar heat), 3.9% from hydroelectricity and the remaining 2.2% is electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and other forms of biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$286 billion in 2015.<ref>[[REN21]], [http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_FullReport_.pdf Global Status Report 2016].

Renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[tide]]s, [[Biomass|plant growth]], and [[Geothermal heating|geothermal heat]], as the [[International Energy Agency]] explains:<ref>IEA Renewable Energy Working Party (2002). ''Renewable Energy... into the mainstream'', p. 9.</ref>
{{quote|Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. In its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth.

Renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant [[Energy security and renewable technology|energy security]] and economic benefits.<ref name="International Energy Agency 2012" /> It would also reduce environmental [[pollution]] such as [[air pollution]] caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | author-link = Mark Z.

Renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas: [[electricity generation]], [[Solar water heating|hot water]]/[[space heating]], [[transportation]], and rural (off-grid) energy services:<ref name="ren15" />
* '''Power generation'''
: By 2040, renewable energy is projected to equal coal and natural gas electricity generation. Several jurisdictions, including Denmark, Germany, the state of South Australia and some US states have achieved high integration of variable renewables. For example, in 2015 wind power met 42% of electricity demand in Denmark, 23.2% in Portugal and 15.5% in Uruguay. Interconnectors enable countries to balance electricity systems by allowing the import and export of renewable energy. Innovative hybrid systems have emerged between countries and regions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=REN21|title=Renewables 2016: Global Status Report|url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report.pdf|website=Renewable Energy Policy Network|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref>
* '''Heating'''
: [[Solar water heating]] makes an important contribution to [[renewable heat]] in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180&nbsp; GWth). Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China. Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households. The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well. In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil. Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fast Growth for Copper-Based Geothermal Heating & Cooling|url=http://en.coppercanada.ca/videos-publications/videos/bright-new-age/geothermal.html|accessdate=26 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426225322/http://en.coppercanada.ca/videos-publications/videos/bright-new-age/geothermal.html|archive-date=26 April 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> The newest addition to Heating is from [[Geothermal heat pump|Geothermal Heat Pumps]] which provide both heating and cooling, and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing national priority<ref name="energy.gov">{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/geothermal-heat-pumps|title=Geothermal Heat Pumps - Department of Energy|website=energy.gov}}</ref><ref name="Net Zero Foundation">{{cite web|url=http://netzerofoundation.org|title=Net Zero Foundation|website=netzerofoundation.org}}</ref> (see also [[Renewable thermal energy]]).
* '''Transportation'''
[[File:Soybeanbus.jpg|thumb|A bus fueled by [[biodiesel]]]]

:[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common [[biofuel]] in Europe.

:A [[solar vehicle]] is an [[electric vehicle]] powered completely or significantly by direct [[solar energy]]. Usually, [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cells contained in [[solar panel]]s convert the [[sun]]'s energy directly into [[electric energy]]. The term "solar vehicle" usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle's [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]]. [[Solar power]] may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions. Solar vehicles are not sold as practical day-to-day transportation devices at present, but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises, often sponsored by government agencies. High-profile examples include [[Tûranor PlanetSolar|PlanetSolar]] and [[Solar Impulse]]. However, indirectly solar-charged vehicles are widespread and [[Electric boat|solar boats]] are available commercially.

== History ==

Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century, nearly all energy used was renewable. Almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy, in the form of traditional [[biomass]] to fuel fires, dates from more than a million years ago. Use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later.<ref name=Fire>{{cite web|title=The Discovery of Fire|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/ancientdailylife/qt/fire_control.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=15 January 2013|author=K. Kris Hirst}}</ref> Probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water. This practice can be traced back some 7000 years, to ships in the Persian Gulf and on the Nile.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=wind energy|encyclopedia=[[The Encyclopedia of Alternative Energy and Sustainable Living]]|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/W/AE_wind_energy.html|accessdate=15 January 2013}}</ref> From [[hot spring]]s, geothermal energy has been used for bathing since [[Paleolithic]] times and for space heating since ancient Roman times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.fairfield.edu/mediacenter/nm_webdesign/s_zandan/sz_alt_energy/geothermal_energy.html|title=Project 2 template|website=faculty.fairfield.edu|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref> Moving into the time of recorded history, the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human [[Manual labour|labor]], [[animal power]], [[water power]], wind, in grain crushing [[windmill]]s, and [[firewood]], a traditional biomass.

In the 1860s and 1870s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source. In 1873 Professor [[Augustin Mouchot]] wrote:

The time will arrive when the industry of Europe will cease to find those natural resources, so necessary for it. Petroleum springs and coal mines are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places.  Will man, then, return to the power of water and wind?

In 1885, [[Werner von Siemens]], commenting on the discovery of the [[photovoltaic effect]] in the solid state, wrote:
{{quote|
text=In conclusion, I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Werner von Siemens|title=On the electromotive action of illuminated selenium, discovered by Mr. Fritts, of New York|journal=Van Nostrands Engineering Magazine|date=1885|volume=32|pages=514–516}}</ref>

[[Max Weber]] mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his [[Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus]] (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), published in 1905.<ref>Weber suggests that the modern economic world will determine the lifestyle of everyone born into it "until the last [[hundredweight]] of fossil fuel is burned" (''[http://www.zeno.org/Soziologie/M/Weber,+Max/Schriften+zur+Religionssoziologie/Die+protestantische+Ethik+und+der+Geist+des+Kapitalismus/II.+Die+Berufsethik+des+asketischen+Protestantismus/2.+Askese+und+kapitalistischer+Geist bis der letzte Zentner fossilen Brennstoffs verglüht ist]'').</ref> Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I. The importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article: "in the far distant future, [[Fossil fuel|natural fuels]] having been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of existence of the human race".<ref>[http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/12-105.pdf "Power from Sunshine": A Business History of Solar Energy] 25 May 2012</ref>

Air flow can be used to run [[wind turbine]]s. Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600&nbsp;kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine.<ref name="EWEA">{{cite web | title = Analysis of Wind Energy in the EU-25 | publisher = European Wind Energy Association | url = http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/WETF/Facts_Summary.pdf | accessdate = 11 March 2007}}</ref> Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-[[altitude]] sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically, [[Capacity factor|full load hours]] of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.<ref>[[Martin Kaltschmitt]], Wolfgang Streicher, Andreas Wiese (eds.): ''Erneuerbare Energien.

Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63&nbsp;GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines.<ref>"Offshore stations experience mean wind speeds at 80 m that are 90% greater than over land on average."

Since water is about 800 times [[Density of air|denser than air]], even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea [[Swell (ocean)|swell]], can yield considerable amounts of energy. There are many forms of water energy:
* Historically, hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs, which are still popular in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Moran|first1=Emilio F.|last2=Lopez|first2=Maria Claudia|last3=Moore|first3=Nathan|last4=Müller|first4=Norbert|last5=Hyndman|first5=David W.|date=2018|title=Sustainable hydropower in the 21st century|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=47|pages=11891–11898|doi=10.1073/pnas.1809426115|pmid=30397145|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6255148}}</ref> The [[List of largest hydroelectric power stations|largest]] of them are the [[Three Gorges Dam]] (2003) in [[China]] and the [[Itaipu Dam]] (1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay.
* [[Small hydro]] systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to {{nowrap|50 MW}} of power. They are often used on small rivers or as a low-impact development on larger rivers. China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-HYDROPOWER.pdf |title=DocHdl2OnPN-PRINTRDY-01tmpTarget |accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>
* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]] plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a large [[reservoir]]. The water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley (using channels, pipes and/or tunnels) until it is high above the valley floor, whereupon it can allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine. This style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity, such as the [[Chief Joseph Dam]] on the Columbia river in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|url=https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Run-of-the-river_hydroelectricity|last=Afework|first=Bethel|date=3 September 2018|work=Energy Education|accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref> Many run-of-the-river hydro power plants are [[micro hydro]] or [[pico hydro]] plants.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. For countries having the [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|largest percentage]] of electricity from renewables, the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use.

[[Wave power]], which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and [[tidal power]], converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially. A demonstration project operated by the [[Ocean Renewable Power Company]] on the coast of [[Maine]], and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power from the [[Bay of Fundy]], location of world's highest tidal flow. [[Ocean thermal energy conversion]], which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, currently has no economic feasibility.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Does Ocean Wave Power Work?|url=https://energyinformative.org/wave-energy/|work=Energy Informative|accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Top five trends in wave power|url=https://www.power-technology.com/features/wave-power-energy/|last=Unwin|first=Jack|date=12 March 2019|accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref>

[[Solar energy]], radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the sun, is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP), [[concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV), [[solar architecture]] and [[artificial photosynthesis]].<ref name=ie11/><ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Fuels and Artificial Photosynthesis|work=Royal Society of Chemistry |year=2012 |url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Policy/Documents/solar-fuels.asp|accessdate= 11 March 2013}}</ref> Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert, and distribute solar energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]]. Active solar technologies encompass [[solar thermal energy]], using [[Solar thermal collector|solar collectors]] for heating, and solar power, converting [[sunlight]] into [[electricity]] either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), or indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP).

A [[photovoltaic system]] converts light into electrical [[direct current]] (DC) by taking advantage of the [[photoelectric effect]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Energy Sources: Solar|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|work=Department of Energy|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, [[growth of photovoltaics|fast-growing]] industry, continues to improve its cost-effectiveness, and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP.<ref>NREL.gov [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/51946.pdf U.S. Renewable Energy Technical Potentials: A GIS-Based Analysis], July 2013 {{rp|iv}}</ref><ref>thinkprogress.org [http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/07/30/606271/national-renewable-energy-laboratory-solar-has-the-most-potential-of-any-renewable-energy-source/ National Renewable Energy Laboratory: Solar Has The Most Potential Of Any Renewable Energy Source] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122225836/http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/07/30/606271/national-renewable-energy-laboratory-solar-has-the-most-potential-of-any-renewable-energy-source/ |date=22 January 2015 }}, 30 July 2013</ref> Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam.

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance [[sustainability]], reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating [[climate change]], and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise.

High temperature geothermal energy is from [[thermal energy]] generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the [[temperature]] of matter. Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from [[radioactive decay]] of minerals (in currently uncertain<ref name=Dye>{{cite journal | last1 = Dye | first1 = S.

The [[geothermal gradient]], which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective ''geothermal'' originates from the Greek roots ''geo'', meaning earth, and ''thermos'', meaning heat.

The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth, all the way down to Earth's core&nbsp;– {{convert|4,000|mi}} down. At the core, temperatures may reach over 9,000&nbsp;°F (5,000&nbsp;°C). Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock. Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma. Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock. This magma then heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes up to {{convert|700|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nemzer |first=J |title=Geothermal heating and cooling |url=http://www.geothermal.marin.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980111021839/http://geothermal.marin.org/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 January 1998 }}</ref>

Low temperature geothermal<ref name="energy.gov"/> refers to the use of the outer crust of the Earth as a [[thermal battery]] to facilitate [[renewable thermal energy]] for heating and cooling buildings, and other refrigeration and industrial uses. In this form of geothermal, a [[geothermal heat pump]] and [[ground-coupled heat exchanger]] are used together to move heat energy into the Earth (for cooling) and out of the Earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis. Low temperature geothermal (generally referred to as "GHP") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements. Thus low temperature geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/|title=Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency® - DSIRE|website=DSIRE}}</ref> and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward net zero energy.<ref name="Net Zero Foundation"/>

== Integration into the energy system ==
{{Main|Variable renewable energy}}
Renewable energy production from some sources such as wind and solar is more variable and more geographically spread than technology based on fossil fuels and nuclear. While integrating it into the wider energy system is feasible, it does lead to some additional challenges. In order for the energy system to remain stable, a set of measurements can be taken. Implementation of energy storage, using a wide variety of renewable energy technologies, and implementing a [[smart grid]] in which energy is automatically used at the moment it is produced can reduce risks and costs of renewable energy implementation.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC|2011|pp=15–16}}</ref> In some locations, individual households can opt to purchase renewable energy through a [[consumer green energy program]].

===Electrical energy storage===
{{main|Energy storage|Grid energy storage}}
Electrical energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy. Electrical energy is stored during times when production (especially from intermittent sources such as [[wind power]], [[tidal power]], [[solar power]]) exceeds consumption, and returned to the [[power grid|grid]] when production falls below consumption. [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] accounts for more than 90% of all grid power storage. Costs of [[lithium-ion batteries]] are dropping rapidly, and are increasingly being deployed grid [[ancillary services]] and for domestic storage. Additionally, power can be stored in [[hydrogen fuel cells]].

From the end of 2004, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60% annually for many technologies. In 2015 global investment in renewables rose 5% to $285.9 billion, breaking the previous record of $278.5 billion in 2011. 2015 was also the first year that saw renewables, excluding large hydro, account for the majority of all new power capacity (134&nbsp;GW, making up 54% of the total).{{cn|date=September 2020}} Of the renewables total, wind accounted for 72&nbsp;GW and solar photovoltaics 56&nbsp;GW; both record-breaking numbers and sharply up from 2014 figures (49&nbsp;GW and 45&nbsp;GW respectively). In financial terms, solar made up 56% of total new investment and wind accounted for 38%.

Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2018 report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), found that the cost of renewable energy is quickly falling, and will likely be equal to or less than the cost non-renewables such as fossil fuels by 2020. The report found that solar power costs have dropped 73% since 2010 and onshore wind costs have dropped by 23% in that same timeframe.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Renewable Energy Will Be Consistently Cheaper Than Fossil Fuels By 2020, Report Claims|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/01/13/renewable-energy-cost-effective-fossil-fuels-2020/#28c56e054ff2|last=Dominic|first=Dominic|magazine=Forbes|date=13 January 2018|accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref>

Current projections concerning the future cost of renewables vary however. The EIA has predicted that almost two thirds of net additions to power capacity will come from renewables by 2020 due to the combined policy benefits of local pollution, decarbonisation and energy diversification.

According to a 2018 report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, wind and solar power are expected to generate roughly 50% of the world's energy needs by 2050, while coal powered electricity plants are expected to drop to just 11%.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Energy Outlook 2018|url=https://bnef.turtl.co/story/neo2018?teaser=true|publisher=Bloomberg|work=Bloomberg New Energy Finance|accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref>
Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity. Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity ([[LCOE]]) is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic ([[Photovoltaics|PV]]), concentrated solar power ([[Concentrated solar power|CSP]]) and some biomass technologies.<ref name=irena111>{{cite web|url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Overview_Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20Costs%20in%202012.pdf |title=Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012: An Overview |author=International Renewable Energy Agency |year=2012 |website=irena.org}}</ref> Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where "oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today".<ref name=irena111/> A series of studies by the US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] modeled the "grid in the Western US under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for 33 percent of the total power." In the models, inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of "between $0.47 and $1.28 to each MegaWatt hour generated"; however, the savings in the cost of the fuels saved "adds up to $7 billion, meaning the added costs are, at most, two percent of the savings."<ref name=ArsTechnica>

=== Trends for individual technologies ===

==== Hydroelectricity ====
In 2017 the world renewable hydropower capacity was 1,154&nbsp;GW.<ref name="IRENA2018" /> Only a quarter of the worlds estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed, the regional potentials for the growth of hydropower around the world are, 71% Europe, 75% North America, 79% South America, 95% Africa, 95% Middle East, 82% Asia Pacific. However, the political realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf|title=Renewable Energy Essentials : Hydropower|website=Iea.org|accessdate=26 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329132409/http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf|archive-date=29 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> There is slow growth taking place in Western counties,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} but not in the conventional dam and reservoir style of the past.

Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, however between 2016 and 2017, investments in renewable energy were higher in developing countries than in developed countries, with China leading global investment with a record 126.6 billion dollars.

Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty reduction]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting. Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools.<ref>[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233918/http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf |date=27 May 2008 }} pp. 7–9.</ref>

===Cellulosic ethanol===
Several refineries that can [[Cellulosic ethanol|process biomass and turn it into ethanol]] are built by companies such as [[Iogen Corporation|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]], while other companies such as the [[Verenium Corporation]], [[Novozymes]], and Dyadic International<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dyadic.com/|title=Dyadic International - Bioenergy, Biopharmaceutical Enzymes}}</ref> are producing enzymes which could enable future [[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization|commercialization]].

===Marine energy===
[[File:Rance tidal power plant.JPG|thumb|[[Rance Tidal Power Station]], France]]
[[Marine energy]] (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by [[ocean wave]]s, [[tide]]s, [[salinity]], and [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|ocean temperature differences]]. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of [[kinetic energy]], or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term marine energy encompasses both [[wave power]]{{spaced ndash}}power from surface waves, and [[tidal power]]{{spaced ndash}}obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. [[Reverse electrodialysis]] (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW). [[Offshore wind power]] is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the [[wind]], even if the [[wind turbine]]s are placed over water. The [[ocean]]s have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.<ref>Carbon Trust, ''Future Marine Energy. Results of the Marine Energy Challenge: Cost competitiveness and growth of wave and tidal stream energy'', January 2006</ref>

===Experimental solar power===
{{main|Solar power#Experimental solar power}}
Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electricity generation. [[Thermogenerator|Thermoelectric]], or "thermovoltaic" devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current.

===Floating solar arrays===
[[Photovoltaic system|Floating solar arrays]] are PV systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs, quarry lakes, irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds. A small number of such systems exist in [[France]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Singapore]], and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=SolarServer.com |url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2014/2014/kw36/kyocera-partners-announce-construction-of-the-worlds-largest-floating-solar-pv-plant-in-hyogo-prefecture-japan.html |title=Kyocera, partners announce construction of the world's largest floating solar PV Plant in Hyogo prefecture, Japan |date=4 September 2014 |access-date=11 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104333/http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2014/2014/kw36/kyocera-partners-announce-construction-of-the-worlds-largest-floating-solar-pv-plant-in-hyogo-prefecture-japan.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=EnergyWorld.com |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/11/running-out-of-precious-land-floating-solar-pv-systems-may-be-a-solution |title=Running Out of Precious Land?

===Solar-assisted heat pump===
{{main|Solar-assisted heat pump}}
A [[heat pump]] is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a [[heat pump]] and [[Solar thermal collector|thermal solar panels]] in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce [[Water heating|hot water]].<ref name = ref1>{{cite web| url = http://www.bine.info/en/publications/themeninfos/publikation/elektrisch-angetriebene-waermepumpen/waermepumpen-plus-solar/ | title = Solar-assisted heat pumps | access-date = 21 June 2016}}</ref> In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator.<ref name=ref2>{{cite web | url = http://www.climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | title = Pompe di calore elio-assistite | language = it | access-date = 21 June 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120107065814/http://climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | archive-date = 7 January 2012 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The goal of this system is to get high [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] and then produce energy in a more [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficient]] and less expensive way.

It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector|hybrid]] ([[Mono-crystalline silicon|mono]]/[[Polycrystalline silicon|polycrystalline]], [[Thin-film solar cell|thin film]]) in combination with the heat pump. The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the [[variable cost]]s of the system.

===Artificial photosynthesis===
[[Artificial photosynthesis]] uses techniques including [[nanotechnology]] to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol.<ref>Collings AF and Critchley C (eds). Artificial Photosynthesis{{spaced ndash}}From Basic Biology to Industrial Application (Wiley-VCH Weinheim 2005) p ix.</ref> Researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis which use a wider region of the solar spectrum, employ catalytic systems made from abundant, inexpensive materials that are robust, readily repaired, non-toxic, stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds, i.e., carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells).<ref name=faunce>{{cite journal|title=Energy and environment policy case for a global project on artificial photosynthesis |journal= Energy & Environmental Science |publisher=RSC Publishing |doi=10.1039/C3EE00063J |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=695|year=2013 |last1=Faunce |first1=Thomas A. |author-link2=Wolfgang Lubitz |last2=Lubitz |first2=Wolfgang |last3=Rutherford |first3=A.

Producing liquid fuels from oil-rich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic. Various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some system that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands.

===Solar aircraft===
[[File:Solar Impulse SI2 pilote Bertrand Piccard Payerne November 2014.jpg|thumb|In 2016, ''[[Solar Impulse]] 2'' was the first [[solar-powered aircraft]] to complete a [[circumnavigation]] of the world.]]

{{see also|Solar Impulse}}

An [[electric aircraft]] is an aircraft that runs on [[electric motor]]s rather than [[internal combustion engine]]s, with electricity coming from [[fuel cell]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[ultracapacitors]], [[power beaming]],<ref>[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/Power-Beaming/index.html Power Beaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217082723/http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/photo/Power-Beaming/index.html |date=17 February 2013 }}</ref> or [[electric battery|batteries]].

===Solar updraft tower===
The [[Solar updraft tower]] is a renewable-energy [[power plant]] for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall [[chimney]] tower. The resulting [[convection]] causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the [[chimney effect]]. This airflow drives [[wind turbine]]s placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce [[electricity]]. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture. A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the [[Vortex engine]] which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a [[vortex]] of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure.

===Space-based solar power===
{{main|Space-based solar power}}
For either photovoltaic or thermal systems, one option is to loft them into space, particularly Geosynchronous orbit. To be competitive with Earth-based solar power systems, the specific mass (kg/kW) times the cost to loft mass plus the cost of the parts needs to be $2400 or less. I.e., for a parts cost plus rectenna of $1100/kW, the product of the $/kg and kg/kW must be $1300/kW or less.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spacejournal.ohio.edu/issue18/thermalpower.html|title=Online Journal of Space Communication|first=Online Journal of Space|last=Communication|website=spacejournal.ohio.edu}}</ref> Thus for 6.5&nbsp;kg/kW, the transport cost cannot exceed $200/kg. While that will require a 100 to one reduction, SpaceX is targeting a ten to one reduction, Reaction Engines may make a 100 to one reduction possible.

{{update section|date=March 2019}}
{{Main|Renewable energy debate|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|Green job|Intermittent power source}}

Renewable electricity production, from sources such as wind power and solar power, is variable which results in reduced [[capacity factor]] and require either energy storage of capacity equal to its total output, or base load power sources from non intermittent sources like [[hydropower]], fossil fuels or [[nuclear power]].

The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow. [[Climate change]] concerns and increasing in [[green job]]s, coupled with high oil prices, [[peak oil]], oil wars, [[oil spill]]s, promotion of [[electric vehicle]]s and renewable electricity, nuclear disasters and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and [[renewable energy commercialization|commercialization]].<ref name="UNEP" /> New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors.<ref name="obama"/>

While renewables have been very successful in their ever-growing contribution to electrical power there are no countries dominated by fossil fuels who have a [[Fossil fuel phase-out|plan to stop]] and get that power from renwables. Only Scotland and Ontario have stopped burning coal, largely due to good natural gas supplies. In the area of transportation, fossil fuels are even more entrenched and solutions harder to find.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/media/training/presentations/Day_2_Renewables_5_Transport.pdf|title=Renewable energy in transport|website=Iea.org|accessdate=26 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412100930/https://www.iea.org/media/training/presentations/Day_2_Renewables_5_Transport.pdf|archive-date=12 April 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> It's unclear if there are failures with policy or renewable energy, but twenty years after the Kyoto Protocol fossil fuels are still our primary energy source and consumption continues to grow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html|title=Statistical Review of World Energy - Home - BP|website=BP global}}</ref>

== Geopolitics of renewable energy ==
{{expand section|date=March 2019}}
From around 2010 onwards, there was increasing discussion about the geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317954274|title=The Geopolitics of Renewable Energy|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=26 June 2019}}</ref> It was argued that former fossil fuels exporters would experience a weakening of their position in international affairs, while countries with abundant renewable energy resources would be strengthened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281774890|title=Future Petroleum Geopolitics: Consequences of Climate Policy and Unconventional Oil and Gas|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=26 June 2019}}</ref> Also countries rich in critical materials for renewable energy technologies were expected to rise in importance in international affairs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=1 March 2019|title=The geopolitics of renewable energy: Debunking four emerging myths|journal=Energy Research & Social Science|volume=49|pages=36–40|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.018|issn=2214-6296|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The GeGaLo index of geopolitical gains and losses assesses how the geopolitical position of 156 countries may change if the world fully transitions to renewable energy resources. Former fossil fuels exporters are expected to lose power, while the positions of former fossil fuel importers and countries rich in renewable energy resources is expected to strengthen.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Overland |first1=Indra |last2=Bazilian |first2=Morgan|last3=Ilimbek Uulu| first3=Talgat |last4=Vakulchuk |first4=Roman |last5=Westphal |first5=Kirsten |date=2019|title=The GeGaLo index: Geopolitical gains and losses after energy transition|journal=Energy Strategy Reviews|language=en|volume=26|pages=100406|doi=10.1016/j.esr.2019.100406|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Environmental impact ==
{{expand section|date=March 2019}}{{Further information|Rare-earth element#Environmental considerations|Biomass#Environmental damage}}

The ability of [[biomass]] and [[biofuels]] to contribute to a reduction in {{CO2}} emissions is limited because both biomass and biofuels emit large amounts of air pollution when burned and in some cases compete with food supply. Furthermore, biomass and biofuels consume large amounts of water.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12039&page=45 |title =Water Issues of Biofuel Production Plants |author=The National Academies Press |year=2008|accessdate = 31 March 2017 |journal=The National Academies Press|doi =10.17226/12039 |isbn =978-0-309-11361-8 }}</ref> Other renewable sources such as [[wind power]], [[photovoltaics]], and [[hydroelectricity]] have the advantage of being able to conserve water, lower pollution and reduce {{CO2}} emissions. 
The installations used to produce wind, solar and hydro power are an increasing threat to key conservation areas, with facilities built in areas set aside for nature conservation and other environmentally sensitive areas. They are often much larger than fossil fuel power plants, needing areas of land up to 10 times greater than coal or gas to produce equivalent energy amounts.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McGrath |first1=Matt |title=Climate change: Green energy plant threat to wilderness areas |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52023881 |publisher=bbc.com |date=25 March 2020}}</ref> More than 2000 renewable energy facilities are built, and more are under construction, in areas of environmental importance and threaten the habitats of plant and animal species across the globe. The authors' team emphazised that their work should not be interpreted as anti-renewables because renewable energy is crucial for reducing carbon emissions. The key is ensuring that renewable energy facilities are built in places where they do not damage biodiversity.<ref>{{cite news |title=Habitats Under Threat From Renewable Energy Development |url=https://www.technologynetworks.com/applied-sciences/news/habitats-under-threat-from-renewable-energy-developments-332651 |agency=technologynetworks.com |date=27 March 2020}}</ref>
