Two of the field made their Top 10 debuts this season and are at the championships for the first time. Between them, they pocketed 21 of the 53 titles that were on offer during this landmark 'Roadmap' season. As last year, the competitors have been divided into two groups named for the colors of the Qatari flag. The White group comprises No.1 seed Dinara Safina, No.4 seed Caroline Wozniacki, No.6 seed Victoria Azarenka and No.8 seed Jelena Janković.

After a lower back injury flared up, she was forced to quit in tears. She withdrew from the tournament and was replaced by [[Vera Zvonareva]]. Her withdrawal ensures that Serena Williams will be the year-end no. 1.<ref>{{Cite web |work=On the Baseline|title=Serena Williams Clinches 2009 Year-End No. 1 Tennis Ranking|url=http://www.onthebaseline.com/2009/10/28/serena-williams-clinches-2009-season-ending-no-1-tennis-ranking/|date=2009-10-28| accessdate= 1 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

The main match featured a sister act as [[Serena Williams]] and [[Venus Williams]] went toe to toe in a tight 3 sets, lasting 160 minutes. Venus broke in the second game of the match. Venus, though, gave her younger sister the break back, with three double faults in the one game. But re-established the break in the fourth game. Serena broke back for a second time before the two players went on to exchange solid service holds. But it was only a temporary respite for Serena as Venus broke once again in the 12th game, sealing the set. Venus fell apart in the second, handing Serena a break in the opening game. Serena further extended her lead in the seventh game of the set when she broke again. Despite being broken back in the very next game, Serena won the set 6-4. The decider saw five out of the first six games going against serve. But despite Venus trailing for much of the set, and even serving to stay in it at 5-3 down it was she who first held a match point. Serena saved it with some ferocious hitting, before forcing the decisive tie-break. Serena took control, racing out to a 4-2 lead at the change of ends before sealing it with her first match point.<ref>{{Cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Advantage, Serena|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~1840451,00.html|date=2009-10-28| accessdate= 25 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

===Day 3===
The first on court featured a marathon between [[Caroline Wozniacki]] and Safina's replacement [[Vera Zvonareva]]. Wozniacki, the No. 4 seed, won 11 of the first 13 games against Zvonareva. But the Russian summoned the form that took her to the final of the season finale a year ago, leveling up at a set all. And saving two match points at 5-6 in that set. After a 10-minute break due to the heat rule Wozniacki came out strong again, building a 3-1 lead in the third. Zvonareva then won three of the next four games to level at 4-4. But the Dane wasn't done, holding then breaking for 5-4 and fighting off severe cramps - and the subsequent tears - to serve it out.<ref>{{Cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Marathon Woman|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~1841360,00.html|date=2009-10-29| accessdate= 25 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

Dementieva, broke in the second game. But the American, who played with heavy strapping on her left thigh, broke back immediately, Serena then ran away with the first set, breaking again in the sixth and eighth games. Serena appeared to be running away with it early in the second set, breaking in the second game. The Russian, though, did manage to find some fight and broke back at the fifth attempt in the third game. The rest of the set went with serve, until Dementieva sent down her 10th double fault in the 10th game of the set to hand Serena three match points. The Russian saved the first two, before the American wrapped up the win at the third attempt 6-2 6-4. As a result, Serena booked her place in the Semifinals.<ref>{{Cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Serena Dominant In Doha|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~1841428,00.html|date=2009-10-29| accessdate= 25 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

The final match saw defending champion [[Venus Williams]] and [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] trying to win their first match of the tournament. The American grabbed the first break, in the fourth game, which is all she needed for the set, 6-2. The second set was much more competitive and this time it was the Russian who grabbed the early break. Despite holding break points Venus was forced to wait until the 10th game to break back.  The set went to a tie-break. Kuznetsova won the tie-break ensuring a decisive third set. They traded early breaks. The American re-established her break lead in the ninth game and Kuznetsova saved two match points as Venus served for it.

===Day 4===
<!--don't change the spelling of the picture because it is another file-->[[File:Jelena Jankovic.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Jelena Janković]] won her match against Wozniacki to clinch a semifinal berth]]The 1st match of the last day of the Round Robin Stage featured [[Jelena Janković]] and [[Caroline Wozniacki]]. The result had several implications on the outcome of the group. A Janković win and she topped it with Wozniacki in 2nd with Azerenka having a chance to leap frog the pair of them later.  This would squeeze Wozniacki out of the tournament.  However a Wozniacki win would see her top with Azerenka going through, without having to play.
The first set saw Janković only lose 5 points on serve, and broke Wozniacki twice to take the set 6-2. The second set was much the same with Janković breaking 3 times.  Wozniacki did offer some resistance breaking once, but could not prevent herself losing the set, 6-2.  For a 6-2, 6-2 win for Janković and top place in the group.<ref>{{Cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website  |title=Janković Secures Spot|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~1842465,00.html|date=2009-10-30| accessdate= 25 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

The next match featured Russians [[Elena Dementieva]] and [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]]. Dementieva needed to win the match to clinch a berth or [[Venus Williams]] and Kuznetsova would end up level with her. With the American going through on the tie break situation, unless Dementieva won in straight sets.   Kutznetsova was looking to end her 8 match losing streak at the Championships. With nothing left to play for but pride, Kuznetsova re-discovered the kind of form that took her to the Beijing title at the beginning of October. Dementieva, looked tense from the start and was forced to save a break point in the second game. It didn't take long for another opportunity to go Kutznetsova's way when in the sixth game when her opponent double faulted twice. Dementieva saved two set points in the eighth game but Kuznetsova made no mistake behind her own serve, sealing the set 6-2. The second set followed much the same pattern, with Kuznetsova breaking in the opening game. The French Open champion secured a second break of serve in the fifth game when Dementieva went wide, before serving the match out.<ref>{{Cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Svetlana Saves Venus|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~1842492,00.html |date=2009-10-30| accessdate= 25 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> This win ended Kuznetsova's 10 match-losing streak, since her first win at the 2006 championship. Venus advanced to the semifinals following this result.

[[File:Agnieszka Radwańska US Open 08.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Agnieszka Radwańska]] defeated Azarenka, as good friend Wozniacki advance to the semifinals]]The last match in the round robin stage featured [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] who replaced co-alternate [[Vera Zvonareva]] and [[Victoria Azarenka]]. Azarenka needed to win to clinch the last semifinal place or it would go to Wozniacki. Azarenka appeared to be cruising to the straight sets win that would have seen her top the white group when she took a 6-4 5-2 lead over Radwańska. After Azarenka broke in the opening game and although Radwańska broke back in the second game, the opening game set the tone as the Belarusian broke again in the 5th and 6th games to race out to a 5-2 lead. Azarenka did suffer a minor blip in concentration towards the end of the first set as she allowed Radwańska one of the breaks back, it was only a temporary lapse as the Belarusian served it out at the second attempt. Azarenka ran away with match in the early stages of the second set, breaking in the first and third games. But the Pole, refused to give up and was rewarded for her patience when she broke back in the sixth game. Azarenka recovered her composure by immediately breaking back and setting up a chance to serve out the match. But the Belarusian undid all her good work with consecutive double faults to hand momentum back to Radwańska. The Pole raced through the next five games to seal the second set and level the match. The match was just one game into the third set when Azarenka was forced to take a medical timeout to have her left thigh heavily strapped. Three games later Azarenka was break points down and in tears after trying to race up the court to a drop shot. The Belarusian saved the first break point, but again she was left sobbing and kneeling on the ground next before going on to double fault and hand her opponent the break. One more medical timeout and one and a half games later and Azarenka decided she could not continue. Radwańska won 4-6 7-5 4-1, Azarenka retired due to cramp. The result meant that Janković topped the group with Wozniacki the runner up.<ref>{{Cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Down to Four in Doha|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~1842561,00.html |date=2009-10-30| accessdate= 25 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>
