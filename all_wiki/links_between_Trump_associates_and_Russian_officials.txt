{{Donald Trump series|expanded=Russia controversies}}
The [[FBI]] and several United States [[United States Congress|congressional]] committees have been investigating links between Russian government officials or their affiliates and individuals associated with [[Donald Trump]], the current [[President of the United States]], since he was a candidate for the office as part of their investigations of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]]. Some of Trump's campaign members, business partners, administration nominees, and family members have been subjected to intense scrutiny following intelligence reports on such Russian interference. The investigations have revealed that a number of them had various types of links to or contacts with Russian officials, business people, banks, and Russian intelligence agencies. Several investigations are underway to determine whether Trump or any of his associates have had improper dealings during their contacts with Russian officials.<ref name=morell-no-collusion /><ref name=clapper-todd/><ref>{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=Ian |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/19/feinstein_no_evidence_of_russian_collusion_with_trump_campaign_but_there_are_rumors.html |title=Feinstein: No Evidence Of Russian Collusion With Trump Campaign, But There Are Rumors |work=[[Real Clear Politics]] |date=May 19, 2017 |accessdate=May 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Savage|first1=Charlie|title=Donald Trump Jr. and Russia: What the Law Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/collusion-trump-russia-campaign.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 12, 2017|date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>

== Overview ==
For many years, there has been intensive public scrutiny of Trump's ties to Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/13/donald-trump-russia-vladimir-putin-us-election-hack|title=Trump's relationship with Russia – what we know and what comes next|last=McCarthy|first=Tom|date=December 13, 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/03/the-web-of-relationships-between-team-trump-and-russia/|title=The web of relationships between Team Trump and Russia|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=March 3, 2017|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}</ref> In a book excerpt published in ''[[Politico]]'', former ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' Russia correspondent [[Luke Harding]] stated that files declassified in 2016 indicated that Czech spies closely followed Trump and then-wife [[Ivana Trump]] in Manhattan and during trips to [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in the time after their marriage in 1977.<ref name="Harding2017">{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|title=The Hidden History of Trump's First Trip to Moscow|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842|accessdate=November 19, 2017|work=[[Politico]]|date=November 19, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Harding_Collusion">{{cite book | last=Harding |first=Luke | title=Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win | publisher=Vintage | year=2017 | isbn=978-0525562511}}</ref> Natalia and Irina Dubinin, daughters of then-Soviet ambassador [[Yuri Dubinin]], are cited as indicating that a seemingly chance meeting of their father with Trump in the autumn of 1986, was part of Dubinin's assignment to establish contact with America's business elite and a determined effort by the Soviet government to cultivate Trump in particular.<ref name="Harding2017"/>

This effort extended through a series of subsequent events, also documented in Donald Trump's book ''[[The Art of the Deal]]'', including a meeting in 1986 between the Ambassador and Trump at [[Trump Tower]] and Dubinin's subsequent invitation to Trump to visit Moscow (which was handled via [[KGB]]-affiliated Intourist and the future Russian [[Permanent Representative to the United Nations]] [[Vitaly Churkin]]).<ref name="Harding2017"/> Harding also asserts that the "top level of the Soviet diplomatic service arranged his 1987 Moscow visit.

By April 19, 2019,''The New York Times'' had documented that "Donald J. Trump and 18 of his associates had at least 140 contacts with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, or their intermediaries, during the 2016 campaign and presidential transition."<ref name="Yourish_Buchanan_1/26/2019">{{cite web | last=Yourish | first=Karen | last2=Buchanan | first2=Larry | title=Mueller Report Shows Depth of Connections Between Trump Campaign and Russians (updated April 19, 2019) | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 26, 2019 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/26/us/politics/trump-contacts-russians-wikileaks.html | access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref>

=== 2016 campaign ===
During the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] as a strong leader. Peter Conradi, in ''GQ'' magazine, described this relationship as a "[[bromance]]".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Viebeck|first1=Elise|last2=Markon|first2=Jerry|last3=DeYoung|first3=Karen|title=Trump, Putin agree in phone call to improve 'unsatisfactory' relations between their countries, Kremlin says|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/11/14/trump-faces-backlash-over-appointing-bannon-as-a-top-aide-a-choice-critics-say-will-empower-white-nationalists/|accessdate=March 14, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=November 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/trump-putin-bromance|title=Trump and Putin's Bromance Could Change the World|last=Conradi|first=Peter|date=January 13, 2017|work=GQ|accessdate=May 29, 2017}}</ref>

On various occasions from 2013 to 2015, Trump stated "I do have a relationship with" Putin, "I met him once", and "I spoke indirectly and directly with President Putin, who could not have been nicer". However, from 2016, during Trump's election campaign, Trump's stance changed. During a press conference in July 2016, Trump claimed, "I never met Putin, I don't know who Putin is ... Never spoken to him", and during another interview Trump said, "I have no relationship with him".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Colvin|first1=Jill|title=Have Trump and Putin met before?

British and Dutch intelligence services have given information to their United States counterparts about meetings in European cities between Russian officials, associates of Putin, and associates of then-President-elect Trump.

The Trump administration reportedly asked the FBI for help in countering news reports about alleged contacts with Russia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Trump administration sought to enlist intelligence officials, key lawmakers to counter Russia stories|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-sought-to-enlist-intelligence-officials-key-lawmakers-to-counter-russia-stories/2017/02/24/c8487552-fa99-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html|date=February 24, 2017|author1=Miller, Greg|author2=Entous, Adam|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref>

Former ambassadors [[Michael McFaul]] and [[John Beyrle]] said they were "extremely troubled" by the evidence of Russian interference in the U.S. election. Both supported an independent investigation into the matter, but dismissed as "preposterous" the allegations that Kislyak participated in it, particularly through his meetings with the Trump campaign: "Kislyak's job is to meet with government officials and campaign people," McFaul stated. "People should meet with the Russian Ambassador and it's wrong to [[criminalize]] that or discourage it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/323479-diplomats-warn-of-russia-hysteria|title=Diplomats warn of Russia hysteria|last=Sommer|first=Will|date=March 11, 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=March 13, 2017}}</ref>

==== ''Washington Post'' letter ====
According to three officials who reviewed a letter sent to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in December 2016, a meeting took place in [[Trump Tower]] on December 1 or 2 between Kushner, Kislyak, and Flynn. In the meeting, Kushner is alleged to have requested that a direct Russian-encrypted communications channel be set up to allow secret communication with Russia which would circumvent safeguards in place by the United States intelligence community. The alleged goal would be to allow Flynn to speak directly to Russian military officials about Syria and other issues. No such communications channel was actually set up, according to the sources.<ref name="Haberman">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/us/roger-stone-donald-trump-russia.html|title=Roger Stone, the 'Trickster' on Trump's Side, Is Under F.B.I.

After the meeting, Kislyak sent a report of the meeting to [[government of the Russian Federation|the Kremlin]] using what he thought were secure channels, but it was intercepted by American intelligence.

Former [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Acting CIA Director]] [[Michael Morell]] stated in March 2017 that he had seen no evidence of collusion between Trump and the Kremlin.

The Trump administration said it was "not aware of any meetings" and said that Prince was not involved in the Trump transition. According to U.S., European, and Arab officials, the meeting was arranged by the [[United Arab Emirates]] and the purpose was to establish a back-channel link between Trump and Putin. The UAE and Trump's associates reportedly tried to convince Russia to limit its support to Iran and Syria. Prince also appeared to have close ties to Trump's chief strategist, [[Stephen Bannon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/06/politics/erik-prince-steve-bannon-seychelles-meeting/index.html|title=Democrats grilled Prince about meeting Bannon|first1=Jeremy|last1=Herb|first2=Katelyn|last2=Polantz|first3=Liz Stark|last3=and|first4=Manu|last4=Raju|website=CNN}}</ref> The Seychelles meeting took place after previous meetings in New York between Trump associates and officials from Russia and the Emirates, while official contacts between the Trump administration and Russian agents were coming under close scrutiny from the press and the U.S. intelligence community.

One of them corroborated ''The Washington Post''{{'}}s account, but said it is not clear whether the initiative to arrange a meeting came from the UAE or Trump's associates and that no Trump transition people were directly involved.
