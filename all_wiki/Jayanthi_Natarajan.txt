==Political career==

===Congress Years===
Her political career began when she was noticed by [[Rajiv Gandhi]] in the 1980s. She was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1986 and once again in 1992.

===Tamil Maanila Congress===
During the 90's Jayanthi Natarajan and other leaders from Tamil Nadu who were unhappy with [[P. V. Narasimha Rao|Narasimha Rao]] decided to break away from the party. They founded the [[Tamil Maanila Congress]] under [[G K Moopanar]]. Jayanthi Natarajan resigned from the Rajya Sabha and was re-elected in 1997 as a TMC member.

The TMC was allied with the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] in Tamil Nadu and was a part of the [[United Front (India)|United Front]] government in the centre. Jayanthi Natarajan was appointed Minister of State for Coal, Civil Aviation and Parliamentary Affairs in 1997.

===Return to the Congress===
With Moopanar's death, the TMC leaders decided to merge with the Congress. Jayanthi Natarajan was noticed by [[Sonia Gandhi]] and appointed spokesperson for the party.
She replaced Mr. [[Jairam Ramesh]] as Environment Minister on 12 July 2011 in the UPA led Union Government. She served as the Minister of State for Environment and forests (Independent Charge) from 12 July 2011 to 20 December 2013. She was allegedly asked to resign from her post to work for the Congress party in the run up to the General Elections of 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Jayanthi-Natarajan-resigns-as-environment-minister/articleshow/27716308.cms | title=Jayanthi Natarajan resigns as environment minister | date=21 December 2013 | newspaper=The Times of India  |accessdate=20 January 2019 }}</ref>

===Resignation from the Congress Party===
''Also see Sahara-Birla Diaries Scandal''

Due to her name appearing in the Sahara Diaries amongst hundreds of politicians who had been paid for environmental clearances, Natarajan was asked by many in the Congress to resign due to accusations  of corruption.<ref name="epw">{{cite journal |last1=Simha |first1=Vijay |title=The Zero Case: Deadly Implications of the Birlaâ€“Sahara Judgment |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |date=4 March 2017 |volume=52 |issue=9 |url=https://www.epw.in/journal/2017/9/web-exclusives/zero-case-deadly-implications-birla%E2%80%93sahara-judgment.html |accessdate=5 November 2018}}</ref> This had been alluded to by Narendra Modi as "Jayanthi tax" during his 2014 election rhetoric. However, further evidence started to turn up in 2015. After the Sahara Diaries investigation Natarajan resigned from the Congress Party on 30 January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author=Politics FP Politics 30 Jan 2015 11:30:29 IST |url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/former-upa-minister-jayanthi-natarajan-quits-congress-blames-sonia-rahul-2071337.html |title=Jayanthi Natarajan quits Congress; blames Rahul in explosive letter |publisher=Firstpost |date=2015-01-30 |accessdate=2018-05-03}}</ref> In a letter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/full-text-of-jayanthi-natarajans-letter-to-sonia-gandhi/article6835522.ece |title=Exclusive: Jayanthi Natarajan's letter to Sonia Gandhi |publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2018-05-03}}</ref> written to [[Sonia Gandhi]], Jayanti Natarajan accused the party machinery, [[Rahul Gandhi]] in particular, of having worked towards a campaign to malign her and her reputation.
