==History and related organizations==
[[Michael Dubke]], David Carney, and several business groups helped start Americans for Job Security in 1997. Carney was political director for President [[George H. W. Bush]], and Dubke was the first executive director and then president of Americans for Job Security until April 2008, when Stephen DeMaura, recruited by Carney, took over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2010/10/26/2395/americans-job-security-how-shadow-group-hustles-funds|title=Americans for Job Security — how a shadow group hustles for funds|date=2010-10-26|website=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=2017-02-17}}</ref>

In 2002, AJS ran over $1 million in advertising attacking Democrat [[Jeanne Shaheen]], who was running for the US Senate from NH in opposition to Republican [[John E. Sununu|John Sununu]]. In the 2008, rematch between Shaheen and Sununu, AJS again funded advertising attacking Shaheen.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathy-sullivan/sununu-front-group-attack_b_110281.html Huffington Post (July 1, 2008) "Sununu front group attacks Shaheen in NH"]</ref> In 2012, it bought $8 million worth of ads opposing Obama's reelection.<ref>{{cite web

Complaints have been filed with the [[Federal Election Commission]] stating that Americans for Job Security should lose its 501(c)(6) status, which is reserved for "business leagues and trade associations" rather than groups that seek to influence elections.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/blogs/secretmoney/2008/09/controversial_probusiness_grou.html NPR (September 15, 2008) "Controversial pro-business group targets Dems"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102194133/http://www.npr.org/blogs/secretmoney/2008/09/controversial_probusiness_grou.html |date=November 2, 2008 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/release.cfm?ID=2415 Public Citizen press release (April 11, 2007)]</ref> In September 2019, the Federal Election Commission reached a conciliation agreement with AJS, requiring them to register as a political committee and disclose their donors, which they did on October 25, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/crew-exposes-dark-money-donors-including-thiel-devos-and-adelson/|title=CREW Exposes Dark Money Donors including Thiel, DeVos and Adelson|website=CREW|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>

In April 2018, watchdog groups filed complaints with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] against Americans for Job Security for failure to comply with federal rules governing nonprofits by not filing its taxes in over three years.<ref>{{cite news |last=Beachum |first=Lateshia |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2018/04/04/21657/americans-for-job-security-irs |title=Conservative 'dark money' group faces IRS complaint over tax filings |work=[[Center for Public Integrity]] |date=April 4, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409000005/https://www.publicintegrity.org/2018/04/04/21657/americans-for-job-security-irs |archivedate=April 8, 2018 |accessdate=April 8, 2018 }}</ref> Americans For Job Security's [[501(c)(6)]] status was revoked by the Internal Revenue Service on June 1, 2018, retroactive to March 15, 2018.<ref>"[https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/displayAll.do?dispatchMethod=displayAllInfo&Id=803151&ein=522062978&country=US&deductibility=all&dispatchMethod=searchAll&isDescending=false&city=&ein1=&postDateFrom=&exemptTypeCode=al&submitName=Search&sortColumn=orgName&totalResults=2&names=Americans+for+Job+Security&resultsPerPage=25&indexOfFirstRow=0&postDateTo=&state=All+States Americans for Job Security]".

==Operation Trenchcoat==
In Alaska, the [[Pebble Mine]] proposal was opposed for endangering commercial fishing, and supported for creating jobs. Alaskan financier [[Robert Gillam]] paid $2 million to join AJS, as encouraged to by Dubke, expecting the money to be used to oppose the mine. Instead, AJS passed almost all of it onto another nonprofit, [[Alaskans for Clean Water]], set up to push a ballot initiative, [[Alaska Clean Water Initiative, 2008]], aimed at imposing clean-water restrictions on the mine, by a group that included Art Hackney, a local Republican consultant and board member of AJS. The [[Alaska Public Offices Commission]] investigated, and AJS paid a $20,000 settlement without admitting guilt, agreeing not to help anyone make anonymous contributions in the future which involved Alaska elections, but without the agreement applying to other states.<ref name="NYT_2010_AJS" />
