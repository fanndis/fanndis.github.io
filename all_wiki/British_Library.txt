The '''British Library''' is the [[national library]] of the United Kingdom<ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/cresearch/skills/using1/usingthebritishlibrary.html "Using the British Library"]. British Library. Retrieved 17 April 2014.</ref> and the [[List of largest libraries|largest library in the world]] by number of items catalogued. It is estimated to contain 170–200&nbsp;million-plus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/ |title=Facts and figures|last=Wight|first=Colin|website=bl.uk|access-date=3 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="auto"/><ref name="BL Exhibition Notes"/><ref name="How Big is the UK Web Archive"/> items from many countries. As a [[legal deposit]] library, the British Library receives copies of all books produced in the United Kingdom and Ireland, including a significant proportion of overseas titles distributed in the UK. The Library is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]].

The British Library is a major [[research library]], with items in many languages<ref name="BL-CDP">{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/cresearch/skills/using1/usingthebritishlibrary.htmll|title=Using the British Library|publisher=British Library|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref> and in many formats, both print and digital: books, manuscripts, journals, newspapers, magazines, sound and music recordings, videos, play-scripts, patents, databases, maps, stamps, prints, drawings. The Library's collections include around 14 million books,<ref name="BLhome">{{cite web|url= http://www.bl.uk/|title=The British Library; Explore the world's knowledge|publisher=British Library|accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref> along with substantial holdings of manuscripts and historical items dating back as far as 2000 BC. In addition to receiving a copy of every publication produced in the UK and Ireland (approximately 8,000 per day), the Library has a programme for content acquisitions. The Library adds some three million items every year occupying {{convert|9.6|km|0}} of new shelf space.<ref>The British Library Annual Report and Accounts 2010/11, [http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/annrep/2010to2011/priorperf/perform/kpis_stats.pdf p. 31]<!--2010/11: 668.0&nbsp;km, 2009/10: 658.4&nbsp;km--></ref> There is space in the library for over 1,200 readers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/|title=Facts and figures|last=Wight|first=Colin|website=bl.uk|language=en|access-date=1 April 2018}}</ref>

Prior to 1973, the Library was part of the [[British Museum]]. The British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the museum, but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same [[British Museum Reading Room|Reading Room]] and building as the museum until 1997. The Library is now located in a purpose-built building on the north side of [[Euston Road]] in [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]], London (between [[Euston railway station]] and [[St Pancras railway station]]), and has a document storage centre and reading room near [[Boston Spa]], near [[Wetherby]] in West Yorkshire. The St Pancras building was officially opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 25 June 1998, and is classified as a Grade I [[listed building]] "of exceptional interest" for its architecture and history.<ref name="listed"/>

== Historical background ==
The British Library was created on 1 July 1973 as a result of the British Library Act 1972.<ref name=blhistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/history/index.html |title=History of the British Library |publisher=British Library |accessdate=7 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nMvVlrFD?url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/history/index.html |archivedate=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Prior to this, the national library was part of the [[British Museum]], which provided the bulk of the holdings of the new library, alongside smaller organisations which were folded in (such as the [[National Central Library (England and Wales)|National Central Library]],<ref>The National Central Library, a tutorial system and a scholarly library for working people who were not connected to an academic institution, had been founded by [[Albert Mansbridge]]. "Mansbridge, Albert." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2006.</ref> the National Lending Library for Science and Technology and the [[British National Bibliography]]).<ref name=blhistory/> In 1974 functions previously exercised by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information were taken over; in 1982 the [[India Office Library and Records]] and the [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] Binderies became British Library responsibilities.<ref>''Whitaker's Almanack''; 1988, p. 409</ref> In 1983, the Library absorbed the [[National Sound Archive]], which holds many sound and video recordings, with over a million discs and thousands of tapes.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nMvMvV7b?url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/soundarch/about/soundarchive.html |archivedate=7 February 2010 |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/soundarch/about/soundarchive.html |title=About the British Library Sound Archive |publisher=British Library |accessdate=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The core of the Library's historical collections is based on a series of donations and acquisitions from the 18th century, known as the "foundation collections".<ref name=Wedgeworth1993>{{Cite book | last=Wedgeworth | first=Robert | year=1993 | title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services | edition=3 | publisher=ALA Editions | isbn=978-0-8389-0609-5 | page=[https://archive.org/details/worldencyclopedi0000unse/page/149 149] | url=https://archive.org/details/worldencyclopedi0000unse/page/149 }}</ref> These include the books and manuscripts of [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]], [[Sir Hans Sloane]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]] and the [[King's Library]] of [[King George III]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snfcc.snfoundation.org/snfcc/EN/index.php?ID=Zq437NxVGjNsz7nf_EN |title=Similar Projects – The British Library |publisher=Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center |accessdate=7 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nMvFvVto?url=http://snfcc.snfoundation.org/snfcc/EN/index.php?ID=Zq437NxVGjNsz7nf_EN |archivedate=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> as well as the [[Old Royal Library]] donated by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]].

[[File:British Library.jpg|thumb|left|The British Library at [[Boston Spa]] (on [[Thorp Arch Trading Estate]]), [[West Yorkshire]]]]

For many years its collections were dispersed in various buildings around [[central London]], in places such as [[Bloomsbury]] (within the British Museum), [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane]], [[Bayswater]], and [[Holborn]], with an [[Interlibrary loan|interlibrary lending]] centre at [[Boston Spa]], {{convert|2.5|mi|0}} east of [[Wetherby]] in West Yorkshire (situated on Thorp Arch Trading Estate), and the newspaper library at [[Colindale]], north-west London.<ref name=blhistory/>

Initial plans for the British Library required demolition of an integral part of Bloomsbury – a seven-acre swathe of streets immediately in front of the Museum, so that the Library could be situated directly opposite. After a long and hard-fought campaign led by Dr George Wagner, this decision was overturned and the library was instead constructed by [[John Laing Group|John Laing plc]]<ref>Ritchie, p. 188</ref> on a site at [[Euston Road]] next to [[St Pancras railway station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloomsburyassociation.org.uk/news/news20070919134787 |title=What and Where is Bloomsbury Village? |publisher=Bloomsbury Association |accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>

Following the closure of the Round Reading Room on 25 October 1997 the library stock began to be moved into the St Pancras building. Before the end of that year the first of eleven new reading rooms had opened and the moving of stock was continuing.<ref>Ovenden, Richard (1997) "The big move", in: ''Rare Books Newsletter''; 57: winter 1997, pp. 49–53</ref> From 1997 to 2009 the main collection was housed in this single new building and the collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at [[Colindale]]. In July 2008 the Library announced that it would be moving low-use items to a new storage facility in [[Boston Spa]] in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale, ahead of a later move to a similar facility on the same site.<ref name="BL Collection Moves Strategy">{{cite web|title=British Library Announces Collection Moves Strategy|url=http://pressandpolicy.bl.uk/Press-Releases/The-British-Library-Announces-Collection-Moves-Strategy-34e.aspx|publisher=British Library|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> From January 2009 to April 2012 over 200&nbsp;km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service.<ref name="200km material moved">{{cite web|title=200km of books successfully moved to high-tech home|url=http://pressandpolicy.bl.uk/Press-Releases/200km-of-books-successfully-moved-to-high-tech-home-56e.aspx|publisher=British Library|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> Construction work on the Newspaper Storage Building was completed in 2013 and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on 8 November 2013.

The new library was designed specially for the purpose by the architect [[Colin St John Wilson]]<ref name=blhistory/> in collaboration with his wife [[MJ Long]], who came up with the plan that was subsequently developed and built.<ref name=MJLongObit>{{cite news|title=MJ Long obituary|author=Peter Carolin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/18/mj-long-obituary|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 October 2018|date=18 September 2018}}</ref> Facing Euston Road is a large piazza that includes pieces of [[public art]], such as large sculptures by [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (a bronze statue based on [[William Blake]]'s study of [[Isaac Newton]]) and [[Antony Gormley]].

In the middle of the building is a six-storey glass tower inspired by a similar structure in the [[Beinecke Library]], containing the [[King's Library]] with 65,000 printed volumes along with other pamphlets, manuscripts and maps collected by King George III between 1763 and 1820.<ref name=Nichols1870>{{Cite journal | last=Nichols | first=Thomas | year=1870 | title=A handy-book of the British Museum: for every-day readers | publisher=Cassell, Petter, and Galpin | page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_4rVCAAAAIAAJ/page/n441 396] | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_4rVCAAAAIAAJ }}</ref> In December 2009 a new storage building at Boston Spa was opened by [[Rosie Winterton]].

On Friday, 5 April 2013, the Library announced that it would begin saving all sites with the suffix [[.uk]] (every British website, [[e-book]], online [[newsletter]], and blog) in a bid to preserve the nation's "[[digital memory]]" (which as of then amounted to about 4.8&nbsp;million sites containing 1&nbsp;billion web pages). The Library would make all the material publicly available to users by the end of 2013, and would ensure that, through technological advancements, all the material is preserved for future generations, despite the fluidity of the Internet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.msn.com/world/british-library-to-preserve-nation%e2%80%99s-entire-internet-history |title=British Library to preserve nation's entire Internet history |publisher=MSN |accessdate=4 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618191813/http://news.msn.com/world/british-library-to-preserve-nation%E2%80%99s-entire-internet-history |archive-date=18 June 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Legal deposit ==
[[File:BritishLibraryInterior02.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the British Library, with the smoked glass wall of the King's Library in the background.]]
In England, [[legal deposit]] can be traced back to at least 1610.<ref>Robert C. Barrington Partridge "The history of the legal deposit of books throughout the British Empire", London: Library Association, 1938</ref> The [[Copyright Act 1911]] established the principle of the legal deposit, ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]]; the [[Cambridge University Library|University Library]] at [[Cambridge]]; the [[Trinity College Library]] at [[Dublin]]; and the [[National Library of Scotland|National Libraries of Scotland]] and [[National Library of Wales|Wales]]. The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning that they have been or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the [[Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries]].

Further, under the terms of [[Irish copyright law]] (most recently the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000), the British Library is entitled to automatically receive a free copy of every book published in Ireland, alongside the [[National Library of Ireland]], the Trinity College Library at Dublin, the library of the [[University of Limerick]], the library of [[Dublin City University]] and the libraries of the four constituent universities of the [[National University of Ireland]]. The Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales are also entitled to copies of material published in Ireland, but again must formally make requests.

The [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]] extended United Kingdom legal deposit requirements to electronic documents, such as [[CD-ROM]]s and selected websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030028_en_1 |title=Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=7 February 2010 |archivedate=7 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nNN5GQdv?url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030028_en_1 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The Library also holds the [[Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections]] (APAC) which include the [[India Office Records]] and materials in the languages of Asia and of north and north-east Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/apac/apacoll/apac.html|title=Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections|publisher=British Library|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref>

The Library is open to everyone who has a genuine need to use its collections. Anyone with a permanent address who wishes to carry out research can apply for a Reader Pass; they are required to provide proof of signature and address.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/inrrooms/stp/register/howreg/howtoregister.html|title=How to register for a Reader Pass|publisher=British Library|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref>

Historically, only those wishing to use specialised material unavailable in other public or academic libraries would be given a Reader Pass. The Library has been criticised for admitting numbers of undergraduate students, who have access to their own university libraries, to the reading rooms. The Library replied that it has always admitted undergraduates as long as they have a legitimate personal, work-related or academic research purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23479468-british-library-like-a-branch-of-starbooks-say-the-literati.do |title=British Library like a branch of Starbooks say the literati |last=Brierley |first=Danny |date=21 April 2008 |work=London Evening Standard|accessdate=8 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063706/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23479468-british-library-like-a-branch-of-starbooks-say-the-literati.do |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}</ref>

The majority of catalogue entries can be found on Explore the British Library, the Library's main catalogue, which is based on Primo.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/PrimoOverview|date=8 December 2011|publisher=Exlibris Group|title=Primo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628163157/http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/PrimoOverview|archivedate=28 June 2015}}</ref> Other collections have their own catalogues, such as western manuscripts. The large reading rooms offer hundreds of seats which are often filled with researchers, especially during the Easter and summer holidays.

British Library Reader Pass holders are also able to view the Document Supply Collection in the Reading Room at the Library's site in [[Boston Spa]] in Yorkshire as well as the hard-copy newspaper collection from 29 September 2014. Now that access is available to legal deposit collection material, it is necessary for visitors to register as a Reader to use the Boston Spa Reading Room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/notices/boston_spa_readingroom.html|title=Major changes for Readers using the Boston Spa Reading Room|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>

==Online, electronic and digital resources==
=== Material available online ===
The British Library makes a number of images of items within its collections available online. Its ''Online Gallery'' gives access to 30,000 images from various medieval books, together with a handful of exhibition-style items in a proprietary format, such as the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]. This includes the facility to "turn the virtual pages" of a few documents, such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s notebooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/index.html|title=Explore the British Library|publisher=British Library|accessdate=25 February 2010}}</ref> Catalogue entries for many of the [[illuminated manuscript]] collections are available online, with selected images of pages or miniatures from a growing number of them,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/welcome.htm |title=Catalogue of Illuminated manuscripts |publisher=Bl.uk |accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref> and there is a database of significant [[bookbinding]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/bookbindings/ |title=Database of bookbindings |publisher=Bl.uk |accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref> [[British Library Sounds]] provides free online access to over 60,000 sound recordings.

The British Library's commercial [[secure electronic delivery service]] was started in 2003 at a cost of £6&nbsp;million. This offers more than 100 million items (including 280,000 journal titles, 50&nbsp;million patents, 5&nbsp;million reports, 476,000 US dissertations and 433,000 conference proceedings) for researchers and library patrons worldwide which were previously unavailable outside the Library because of [[copyright]] restrictions. In line with a government directive that the British Library must cover a percentage of its operating costs, a fee is charged to the user. However, this service is no longer profitable and has led to a series of restructures to try to prevent further losses.<ref>{{cite news

In October 2010 the British Library launched its ''Management and business studies portal''. This website is designed to allow digital access to management research reports, consulting reports, working papers and articles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbsportal.bl.uk/about/index.aspx|title=Management and business studies portal: About this site|publisher=British Library|accessdate=3 March 2011}}</ref>

In November 2011, four million newspaper pages from the 18th and 19th centuries were made available online. The project will scan up to 40 million pages over the next 10 years. The archive is free to search, but there is a charge for accessing the pages themselves.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15932683 |title=British Library scans 18th and 19th-Century newspapers |date=29 November 2011 | work=BBC News}}</ref>

==Services and departments==
=== Business and IP Centre ===
In May 2005, the British Library received a grant of £1&nbsp;million from the [[London Development Agency]] to change two of its reading rooms into the Business & IP Centre. The Centre was opened in March 2006.<ref name=Chadwick >{{cite news |last=Chadwick |first=Gareth |title=The British Library: An excellent business support centre |date=5 June 2007 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/sme/the-british-library-an-excellent-business-support-centre-451812.html|quote=The pilot was such a success that in May 2005 the London Development Agency, the Mayor of London's agency for business and jobs, announced a £1m funding package to turn the project into a permanent resource. The centre's facilities were enlarged and upgraded to include state-of-the-art meeting rooms, a networking area and wireless internet access. A team of information experts is on hand to help people find the information they need. The new centre re-launched in March 2006. In the 14 months since, it has welcomed more than 25,000 people through its doors.}}</ref> It holds arguably the most comprehensive collection of business and intellectual property (IP) material in the United Kingdom and is the official library of the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]].

The collection is divided up into four main information areas: [[market research]], company information, trade directories, and [[Magazine|journals]]. It is free of charge in hard copy and online via approximately 30 subscription databases. Registered readers can access the collection and the databases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startups.co.uk/what-s-on-offer-at-the-british-library-business-and-ip-centre.html |title=What's on offer at the British Library Business & IP Centre? |publisher=Startups |accessdate=28 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929010654/http://www.startups.co.uk/what-s-on-offer-at-the-british-library-business-and-ip-centre.html |archivedate=29 September 2011 }}</ref>

There are over 50 million patent specifications from 40 countries in a collection dating back to 1855. The collection also includes official gazettes on patents, [[trade marks]] and [[Registered Design]]; law reports and other material on [[litigation]]; and information on [[copyright]]. This is available in hard copy and via online databases.<ref name=bipc>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/bipc/aboutus/faq/index.html |title=British Library Business & IP Centre in London &#124; Frequently asked questions |publisher=British Library |date=30 November 2003 |accessdate=28 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216143804/http://www.bl.uk/bipc/aboutus/faq/index.html |archivedate=16 February 2011  }}</ref>

Staff are trained to guide [[small and medium enterprise]]s (SME) and entrepreneurs to use the full range of resources.<ref name=bipc/>

=== Document Supply Service ===
As part of its establishment in 1973, the British Library absorbed the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL), based near [[Boston Spa]] in Yorkshire, which had been established in 1961. Before this, the site had housed a [[World War II]] [[Royal Ordnance Factory]], [[ROF Thorp Arch]], which closed in 1957. When the NLL became part of the British Library in 1973 it changed its name to the British Library Lending Division, in 1985 it was renamed as the British Library Document Supply Centre and is now known as the British Library Document Supply Service, often abbreviated as BLDSS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/atyourdesk/docsupply/about/history/index.html|title=British Library document supply history|publisher=British Library|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>

BLDSS now holds 87.5&nbsp;million items, including 296,000 international journal titles, 400,000 conference proceedings, 3&nbsp;million [[monographs]], 5 million official publications, and 500,000 UK and North American theses and dissertations. 12.5&nbsp;million articles in the Document Supply Collection are held electronically and can be downloaded immediately.<ref>Richard Ebdon, 'The World's One-Stop-Shop for Information Needs', ''Pipeline: The Journal of the Pharmaceutical Information & Pharmocovigilance Association'', 40 (March 2013), pp. 12–13</ref>

The collection supports [[R&D|research and development]] in UK, overseas and international industry, particularly in the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. BLDSS also provides material to Higher Education institutions, students and staff and members of the public, who can order items through their [[Public Library]] or through the Library's BL Document Supply Service (BLDSS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/atyourdesk/docsupply/industryspecificinfo/publisher/docsupply|title=Document Supply Information for Publishers|publisher=British Library|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Document Supply Service also offers Find it For Me and Get it For Me services which assist researchers in accessing hard-to-find material.

In April 2013, BLDSS launched its new online ordering and tracking system, which enables customers to search available items, view detailed availability, pricing and delivery time information, place and track orders, and manage account preferences online.<ref name="BLDSS online system">{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/atyourdesk/docsupply/help/customerupdates/index.html#BLDSS:OnlineOrderinglaunchedApril2013|title=Document Supply News & Customer Updates|publisher=British Library|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>

=== Sound archive ===

=== Moving image services ===
Launched in October 2012, the British Library's moving image services provide access to nearly a million sound and moving image items onsite, supported by data for over 20 million sound and moving image recordings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/movingimage/2012/10/new-moving-image-service-at-the-british-library.html |title=New moving image service at the British Library |publisher=British Library, Moving Image Blog |date=1 October 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313095406/http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/movingimage/2012/10/new-moving-image-service-at-the-british-library.html |archivedate=13 March 2013  }}</ref> The three services, which for copyright reasons can only be accessed from terminals within the Reading Rooms at St Pancras or Boston Spa, are:

* BBC Pilot/[[BBC Redux|Redux]]: A collaboration with [[BBC Research & Development]] to mirror its archive which has, since June 2007, been recording 24/7 of all of the BBC's national and some regional broadcast output. BBC Pilot includes 2.2&nbsp;million catalogue records and 225,000 playable programmes, but unlike BBC Redux it does not include any broadcasts beyond 2011.
* Broadcast News: Since May 2010, the British Library has been making off-air recordings of daily TV and radio news broadcasts from seventeen channels, including BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky News, Al-Jazeera English, NHK World, CNN, France 24, Bloomberg, Russia Today and China's CCTV News. Many of the programs come with subtitles, which can be electronically searched, greatly enhancing the value of the collection as a research tool.
* Television & Radio Index for Learning & Teaching (TRILT): Produced by the British Universities Film & Video Council ([[BUFVC]]), TRILT is a database of all UK television and radio broadcasts since 2001 (and selectively back to 1995). Its 16 million records, growing by a million per year, cover every channel, broadcast and repeat.

==Periodicals and philatelic collections==
=== Newspapers ===
[[File:British Library Newspapers.JPG|thumb|Former British Library Newspapers building, [[Colindale]]]]

The Library holds an almost complete collection of British and Irish newspapers since 1840. This is partly because of the legal deposit legislation of 1869, which required newspapers to supply a copy of each edition of a newspaper to the library. London editions of national daily and Sunday newspapers are complete back to 1801. In total, the collection consists of 660,000 bound volumes and 370,000 reels of [[microfilm]] containing tens of millions of newspapers with 52,000 titles on 45&nbsp;km of shelves. From earlier dates, the collections include the [[Thomason Tracts]], comprising 7,200 seventeenth-century newspapers,{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} and the [[Burney Collection]], featuring nearly 1 million pages of newspapers from the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.resourceshelf.com/go/resourceblog/52810 |title=The Burney Collection of 17th and 18th Century Newspapers |publisher=Web.resourceshelf.com |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903023424/http://web.resourceshelf.com/go/resourceblog/52810# |archive-date=3 September 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The section also holds extensive collections of non-British newspapers, in numerous languages.

The Newspapers section was based in [[Colindale]] in North London until 2013, when the buildings, which were considered to provide inadequate storage conditions and to be beyond improvement, were closed and sold for redevelopment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/01/19/farewell-to-history/ |title=Farewell to history? |first=Alan |last=Cleaver |work=Independent|date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2011 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125225356/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/01/19/farewell-to-history/ |archivedate=25 January 2011 }}</ref><ref name="faq">{{cite web|title=Newspaper Collection – Frequently Asked Questions for Readers|publisher=British Library|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/newspapermoves/newspaper-moves-faqs.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref> The physical holdings are now divided between the sites at St Pancras (some high-use periodicals, and rare items such as the Thomason Tracts and Burney collections) and Boston Spa (the bulk of the collections, stored in a new purpose-built facility).<ref name="faq"/>

A significant and growing proportion of the collection is now made available to readers as surrogate facsimiles, either on microfilm, or, more recently, in digitised form.

The collections include [[postage stamp|postage]] and [[revenue stamp]]s, [[postal stationery]], [[essay (philately)|essays]], [[proofreading|proofs]], [[cover (philately)|covers]] and entries, "[[cinderella stamp]]" material, specimen issues, [[airmail]]s, some [[postal history]] materials, official and private [[postal system|posts]], etc., for almost all countries and periods.<ref name=pocket>{{Cite book |author1=David Beech |author2=Paul Skinner |author3=Bobby Birchall |author4=Catherine Britton |url=http://shop.bl.uk/mall/productpage.cfm/BritishLibrary/ISBN_9780712309530/353759 |title=Treasures in Focus – Stamps |publisher=British Library |accessdate=16 January 2011 |isbn=978-0-7123-0953-0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317061325/http://shop.bl.uk/mall/productpage.cfm/BritishLibrary/ISBN_9780712309530/353759 |archive-date=17 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

An extensive display of material from the collections is on exhibit, which may be the best permanent display of diverse classic stamps and philatelic material in the world. Approximately 80,000 items on 6,000 sheets may be viewed in 1,000 display frames; 2,400 sheets are from the Tapling Collection. All other material, which covers the whole world, is available to students and researchers.<ref name=pocket/> As well as these collections, the library actively acquires literature on the subject. This makes the British Library one of the world's prime philatelic research centres. The Head Curator of the Philatelic Collections is Paul Skinner.
