==Background==
Under the brand licensing agreement between Turner Broadcasting System and Nine Media, the latter will pay CNN an undisclosed amount of monthly fee for programs and expertise from [[CNN International]] and [[CNN|CNN/U.S.]] that will air in the CNN Philippines in exchange of  locally produced news, current affairs and lifestyle programs and rolling news coverage from 9News, all based on the standards of CNN.  Also, 9News will be trained by CNN staff at the [[CNN Center]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]] to enhance their reporting that will also help them to contribute reports for CNN International along with its news bureaus scattered worldwide; as consultants from the latter will help Nine Media/RPN for further development and expansion of CNN Philippines. The official news website, 9news.ph will be redesigned and changed into CNNPhilippines.com.<ref>[http://www.rappler.com/nation/71995-cnn-philippines-airing-2015 CNN Philippines to start airing 1st quarter 2015] retrieved October 15, 2014.</ref>

On the day of the soft launching of CNN Philippines held last October 14, 2014, at the [[Solaire Resort & Casino]], CNN Worldwide President [[Jeff Zucker]] released a statement that said:

{{blockquote|The global news gathering power of CNN combined with the local perspective Nine Media Corporation brings enables us to provide first-class news and information to millions of Filipinos in a way that we have not been able to previously.

==History==

===Talk TV (2011–2012)===
{{Main|Talk TV (Philippines)}}

The channel was known as Talk TV from March 2, 2011, to October 29, 2012, on [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN Channel 21]]. Talk TV is formed by the [[Solar Television Network]], by-then owned by [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]] after the latter led the privatization of state-sequestered [[Radio Philippines Network]] (RPN) in 2011. The first programs that aired on the channel were [[Dateline NBC]], [[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]], Today's Talk, [[NBC Nightly News]], [[Inside Edition]], [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|Tonight Show with Jay Leno]] and [[Late Show with David Letterman]].<ref name="manilastandardtoday.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideBusop.htm?f=2011/february/25/vicagustin.isx&d=2011/february/25|title=Tiengs move into news|last=Agustin|first=Victor C.|date=February 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714043823/http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideBusop.htm?f=2011%2Ffebruary%2F25%2Fvicagustin.isx&d=2011%2Ffebruary%2F25|archivedate=July 14, 2011|accessdate=December 10, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Solar News, known for its back-to-basics and unbiased journalism, was formed in January 2012 during the coverage of the Impeachment Trial of former Chief Justice Renato Corona. Post-EDSA revolution [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]] newsmen Pal Marquez, Jing Magsaysay and Pia Hontiveros together with former ANC anchors Claire Celdran, Mai Rodriguez and Nancy Irlanda were known as the pillars of Solar News. Reportorial team was composed by former reporters of [[NewsWatch (Philippine TV series)|RPN NewsWatch]], the sole and longest-running English newscast of Radio Philippines Network, which was stopped airing in 2012 as an effect of RPN's privatization.<ref name="manilastandardtoday.com" />

The hourly news bulletin Solar News Update (now Headlines) first aired in March 2012, followed by the primetime newscast Solar Network News and Solar Nightly News, which started airing on June 18 and July 16 of the same year, and Daybreak and Newsday on October 1, 2012. On October 30, 2012, at 05:30 am (UTC +8:00), Talk TV finally signed off to make way for the launching of the first 24-hour English news channel on both cable TV and free-to-air TV, Solar News Channel.<ref name="manilastandardtoday.com" />

===Solar News Channel (2012–2014)===
{{Main|Solar News Channel}}
Dubbed then as the "First 24/7 All-English News Channel on Free TV", Solar News Channel (SNC) replaces TalkTV. SNC was launched at 5:45am of October 30, 2012, on SBN Channel 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2013/12/02/solar-news-on-free-tv-moves-to-channel-9-/|title=Solar News on free TV, moves to channel 9|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

During the first months of the operations, the channel was producing major local newscasts including a native language newscast [[Solar News Cebuano]], a sports newscast [[Sports Desk (2004 TV series)|Solar Sports Desk]] and public affairs programs Legal HD, Medtalk, News.PH, Opposing Views, Elections 2013 and News Cafe. 60 Minutes, Top Gear, Undercover Boss and the "Stories" documentary block was also launched during SNC's time. SNC launched its own mobile application for smartphone users. Its consists of features such as live streaming, catch-up episodes (newscasts and Stories) and latest news from the network's website, solarnews.ph.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnews.ph/lifestyle/technology/2013/11/29/solar-news-app-news-you-can-use-on-the-move|title=CNN Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411132750/http://www.solarnews.ph/lifestyle/technology/2013/11/29/solar-news-app-news-you-can-use-on-the-move|archive-date=April 11, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In November 2013, San Miguel Corp. President and COO [[Ramon S. Ang]] personally acquired the minority stake of STVNI. Brothers Wilson and William Tieng were the majority stockholders then of STVNI.<ref name="SanMig RPN">{{cite news|title= MVP-Ang rivalry set to spill over into television with San Miguel acquisition of Solar stake

Solar News Channel then began to phase out its "Solar" branding on its newscast as it leaned away from the Tiengs. It also launched the Kapampangan national newscast ''[[Kapampangan News]]'', along with the public service program ''[[Serbisyo All Access]]'', which is shown in Filipino language. Solar News Channel was closed down before midnight of August 22, 2014.<ref name="solar-news-channel-turns-into-9tv">{{cite web|ref=harv |date=August 13, 2014 |url=http://www.9news.ph/lifestyle/2014/08/13/solar-news-channel-turns-into-9tv |title=Solar News Channel turns into 9TV |publisher=9news.ph |accessdate=December 10, 2014 |last=Solar News Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008155932/http://www.9news.ph/lifestyle/2014/08/13/solar-news-channel-turns-into-9tv |archivedate=October 8, 2014 }}</ref>

===9TV (2014–2015)===
{{Main|9TV}}
SNC was relaunched as 9TV on August 23, 2014. The Solar brand on Channel 9 was retired after the ALC Group of Companies thru [[Aliw Broadcasting Corporation]] bought out the 34% stake of the Tiengs' group with Solar Television Network and RPN 9. The Tiengs were losing money after they invested in RPN 9 and the group focused on the cable channels of [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]]. Solar News was then rebranded as 9News, with the programming and personnel retained. ''Kids Weekend'', ''Home Shopping Network'', ''TV Mass for the Homebound'' and local informative shows including ''Something to Chew On'', ''Boys' Ride Out'', ''Drive'', ''Good Company'', ''Two Stops Over'' and ''Bogart Case Files'' became part of 9TV's programming line-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2014/08/14/1357346/solar-news-channel-now-9tv|title=Solar News Channel now 9TV|work=philstar.com|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

Controversies also hounded 9TV as one of the motorpool drivers of the news division allegedly violated traffic rules after the news crewcab was entered a no-left/no-entry road (counterflow) while on hazard in the Balara area last September 14, 2014. 9News management then imposed a disciplinary actions and penalties against the driver and his designated reporter and cameraman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsgra.ph/1741/video-of-counterflowing-media-man-from-9news-stirs-controversy/|title=EXCL: Video of Counterflowing ‘Media Man from 9NEWS’ Stirs Controversy|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

=== Transition to CNN Philippines ===
On October 14, 2014, Cabangon-Chua announced their partnership with the Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News Network (CNN).<ref>{{cite news|title=9TV forges partnership with CNN|url=http://business.inquirer.net/180288/9tv-forges-partnership-with-cnn|accessdate=February 12, 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=October 14, 2014}}</ref>

As a part of transition to CNN Philippines, 9TV temporarily used green screen as its news studio in December 2014, along with the renovations of the newsroom and the strategic hiring of the personnel, and its newscasts began adopting the CNN graphic package more than a week later (January 15, 2015), in time for 9TV's coverage of [[Pope Francis]]'s [[Pope Francis's visit to the Philippines|visit to the country]]. ''Home Shopping Network'' (now [[Shop TV]]) and ''Kids Weekend'' block are also axed on the said month. Foreign non-CNN produced programs ([[NBC]] and [[CBS]] programs) were also dropped in February, including [[NBC Nightly News]] (which was, in any way, unrelated to the suspension, and the eventual axing of its news anchor [[Brian Williams]] on February 10, 2015, a few weeks before being pulled out of the 9TV programming, due to controversies regarding to the Iraq War helicopter incident).

===Launch and first eight months===
[[File:CNN Philippines OB van; news gathering satellite truck (Salcedo, Makati)(2015-04-28) 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Satellite news gathering truck of CNN Philippines in Salcedo Village,  [[Makati]].]]

CNN Philippines, along with its tagline "We Tell The Story Of The Filipino" was launched after a few weeks of preparation on March 16, 2015. It's programmings from [[9TV]] is remained and it added CNN programs to add the program line-up. In its initial broadcast, picture format remained in full 4:3 standard definition while testing the 14:9 broadcast format overnight. Since Holy Week of 2015, CNN Philippines started full-time broadcasts on 16:9 widescreen format, aligning with several CNN worldwide channels. However, the output is shown as a 14:9 letterboxed widescreen (both on free-to-air and cable/satellite). It is the first Philippine free-to-air and TV channel to use the [[14:9]] [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] to match the latter format, a distinction that lasted until March 2017.

===Magsaysay out, Jarin-Bennett in===
In September 2015, Nine Media Corporation President Reggie Galura and CNN Philippines SVP for News and Current Affairs Jing Magsaysay left the network, following the "right-sizing" retrenchment of 70 junior staffers and contractual employees, who worked in the company for Programming and Technical Engineering divisions. Also, Magsaysay left his sole noontime newscast, [[CNN Philippines Newsroom]], leaving [[Mai Rodriguez]] the solo anchor of Newsroom

Effective November 2, 2015, CNN International's [[Armie Jarin-Bennett]] took over as Managing Editor of CNN Philippines, replacing Magsaysay. Bennett had been the head of CNN Content Sales and Partnerships in Asia Pacific after 17 years of working as writer and producer on various programs for [[CNN]] and [[CNN International]]. Her production expertise gave her an [[33rd News & Documentary Emmy Awards|2012 Emmy Award]] for the coverage of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]] and a nomination for [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)]] coverage in 2013. Born and raised in Manila, Jarin-Bennett began her career as radio newscaster before moving as an intern in the [[CNN Center]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite news|title=Armie Jarin-Benett Named EVP and Managing Editor of CNN Philippines|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2015/10/armie-jarin-bennett-named-evp-managing.html|accessdate= October 20, 2015|publisher=Media Newser Philippines}}</ref>

===Expansion of news operation and first anniversary===
On February 15, 2016, CNN Philippines updated its station bumpers, remove the station's voice over, improved intros for their newscasts, similar to some CNN International programs like ''[[CNN Newsroom (International TV program)|CNN Newsroom]]'', ''[[CNN Today]]'', ''[[International Desk]]'', ''[[CNN Business|CNN Money]]'' and ''CNN Money View'', with bluer hue, with exceptions to their lifestyle programming, while newer bumpers for general segments and current affairs shows followed suit. The channel also changed their theme music for their newscasts and bumpers and added new programs, led by the Philippine edition of [[New Day (CNN Philippines)|New Day]].   ''[[CNN Philippines Nightly News|Nightly News]]'' was axed in favor of an expanded ''[[CNN Philippines Newsroom|Newsroom]]'', making ''[[CNN Philippines Network News]]'' the sole lineal brand holdover from its ''Solar'' tenure. Personalities from other networks such as [[Pinky Webb]] joined CNN Philippines, where she is the main anchor of ''[[CNN Philippines Balitaan|Balitaan]]'', its first ever newscast in [[Filipino language|Filipino]], which was first used in ''Serbisyo All Access'' and in the Post Debate Analysis of [[PiliPinas Debates 2016]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2016/03/breaking-pinky-webb-officially-joins.html?m=1|title=Pinky Webb officially joins CNN Philippines|website=www.medianewser.com|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2016/03/first-on-mnp-pinky-webb-to-anchor-cnn.html|title=First on MNP: Pinky Webb to anchor CNN Philippines' first Filipino-language newscast|website=www.medianewser.com|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref>

Since February 2016, CNN PH also started to phase out current affairs shows that debuted under [[Solar News Channel]] ([[Legal Help Desk]]), former CNN shows (''Eco-Solutions'') and HLN produced shows (''[[Nancy Grace (TV program)|Nancy Grace]]'' and ''[[Dr. Drew On Call]]'') that were aired as filler programming in favor of newer staple programming such as ''[[Smerconish]]'' and more room for news programming.

===Emphasis on local and global programming===
In August 2016, '''CNN Sans''' (the corporate font of their mother network) heavily replaced [[Helvetica]] that was used during their transition and first year of operation (which used as substitute to [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham]]) as the on-air graphics of their newscasts and current affairs shows, following suit on the implementation of the new font in all CNN operated and franchised networks worldwide. The font was later used on their promos, infomercials, and revamped bumpers in February 2016, and also on their [[PiliPinas Debates 2016]] (Vice Presidential leg) and Traffic Center (which shared with the same graphic package).

HLN-produced programs such as ''[[Morning Express with Robin Meade|Morning Express]]'', ''Weekend Express'' and ''The Daily Share'' (which ended on HLN's programming on mid-November 2016) were axed from the local lineup during the main network's coverage of the respective Republican and Democratic National Conventions but returned on August 23 due to putting the premiere of CNN International programming (''[[Amanpour]]'' and ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'') on hold. ''[[Amanpour]]'' (whose select stories were featured on CNN PH's ''[[Global Conversations]]'') was eventually given the go-signal, but is only shown on special occasions when the show discusses Philippine affairs in global context. Its first stand-alone broadcast on CNN Philippines was on August 31, 2016, with [[Christiane Amanpour]] interviewing Senators [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] and [[Leila de Lima]].

CNN/U.S. programming (''[[The Lead with Jake Tapper|The Lead]]'', ''[[Smerconish]]'' and ''[[Reliable Sources]])'' that aired during their first year of operation were aired in limitation on the same month, ''[[Erin Burnett OutFront]]'' remained on the local lineup until September 22, 2016.

Since mid-September 2016, HLN programming was relegated to the cable-only [[Graveyard slot|overnight graveyard slot]] to make way to the expansion of current affairs blocks. ''The Service Road with James Deakin'' debuted on September 19 while ''The Source with Pinky Webb'' followed suit a week later. Two [[CBS]]-produced shows (''[[60 Minutes]]'' and [[Undercover Boss (Canadian TV series)|Undercover Boss: Canada]]) were axed the same month.

Effective October 9, 2016, [[Armie Jarin-Bennett]] was appointed as president of [[Nine Media Corporation]]. With her promotion to presidency, more CNN International shows began airing as weekend staples, notably ''The Art of Movement'' and ''Vital Signs with Dr. Sanjay Gupta'', that premiered during the latter week of October. ''Vital Signs'' is currently a companion show to CNN Philippines' ''[[MedTalk]]''.

===Second year, sweeping restructuring===
Sweeping restructuring started out by February, starting off with the further replacement of shows originating from the network's predecessors. ''Newsroom'' was further expanded to include a mid-morning Filipino newscast with Ruth Cabal, a former news anchor and reporter from [[GMA Network]], replacing ''[[Serbisyo All Access]]'' since February 6 and a weekend edition since March 4. Additional political shows also premiered such as ''Political Insider with [[Gilbert Remulla]]'' (which was later axed in July 2017, after the sought controversy of said host, due to his [[Duterte Diehard Supporters|strong opinion stance leaning towards]] President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] on engaging word wars against with the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] supporters on [[Twitter]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/07/cnn-philippines-axes-gilbert-remulla-program.html|title=CNN Philippines axes Gilbert Remulla's public affairs show 'Political Insider'|website=www.medianewser.com|access-date=July 26, 2017}}</ref>''.'' ''[[CNN Philippines Network News]]'' would be retired and replaced with ''[[News Night (CNN Philippines)|News Night with Pia Hontiveros]]'' effective March 27, and weekend slots would be filled by ''Sports Desk Weekend'' effective March 11. Upon cancellation of ''[[Cebuano News]]'' and ''[[Kapampangan News]]'' by the end of March 2018, the second hour of ''[[CNN Newsroom (International TV program)|CNN Newsroom]]'' (simulcast from [[CNN International]]) replaced the vacant slot. It also introduced the new slogan "At The Heart Of The Story", that showcases network's capability to report instantly and tell the story. But it is only applicable for promo plugs only.

In April 2017, the network reconfigured to a [[16:9 aspect ratio|16:9]] [[anamorphic widescreen]] standard-definition format, eliminating the use of [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterbox]].

===Weekend programming expansion, extension of partnership===
On September 1, 2018, CNN Philippines launched its weekend morning block, consisting of animated shows from sister channel [[Cartoon Network (Philippines)|Cartoon Network]], infotainment show ''KidDo'', and a 15-minute "junior edition" of its news program ''[[CNN Philippines Newsroom|Newsroom]]'' hosted by teenagers. The now called ''CNN Philippines Junior'' block is similar to the ''Kids Weekend'' block from its predecessor [[9TV]]. This also marks the return of the [[Cartoon Network (Philippines)|Cartoon Network]] block on RPN since it was discontinued on 2010 since [[C/S 9]] or [[Solar TV]] affiliation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regularcapital.com/2018/09/cartoon-network-shows-now-airing-weekend-mornings-on-cnn-philippines-junior-block/|title=Cartoon Network Shows Now Airing Weekend Mornings On CNN Philippines’ Junior Block|date=September 1, 2018|location=Manila|publisher=Regular Capital|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>

On November 13, 2019, CNN Philippines announced its intention to air weekend broadcasts of selected [[National Basketball Association|NBA games]] in interim basis (as a blocktimer) following the expiration of broadcast rights of [[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]] and [[ABS-CBN Sports]] which led to the closure of [[NBA Premium TV]] and [[Basketball TV|BTV]] (CNN PH's free TV partner, RPN 9, previously aired the games also under [[C/S 9]] or [[Solar TV]] affiliation).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnnphilippines.com/sports/2019/11/13/cnn-philippines-nba-weekend-games-free-tv-local.html |title= CNN Philippines to air NBA weekend games|author=<!--Not stated-->  |date= November 13, 2019|website=CNN Philippines |access-date=November 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/nba/244816-games-now-available-free-tv-philippines |title=NBA games now available on free TV in PH |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=November 16, 2019 |website= |publisher=[[Rappler]] |access-date=November 14, 2019 |quote=}}</ref>  This is due to the pending evaluation of the joint bid of ABS-CBN Sports and [[Cignal TV]]/[[ESPN5]] for the aforementioned broadcast rights.

Based from a December 2019 report of Media Newser Philippines, Nine Media Corporation and WarnerMedia agreed to extend its 2014 brand licensing agreement until the end of 2024. The extension of partnership is brought about by the positive performance and financial stability of CNN Philippines as well as to improve its ratings of the network in 2019.

On March 18, 2020, CNN Philippines was forced to go off-air until March 22, after an employee working at the Worldwide Corporate Center, where the network's headquarters is situated, was confirmed to be positive with COVID-19.<ref>{{cite news |title=CNN Philippines temporarily goes off air as building undergoes disinfection |url=https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/3/18/CNN-Philippines-Worldwide-Corporate-Center-coronavirus-COVID-19-case.html |accessdate=March 18, 2020 |work=CNN Philippines |date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> The channel, however, resumed broadcasts operations on March 23, 2020. The network went off-air again on July 7, 2020, after a utility staff tested positive for COVID-19.<ref>{{cite news|title=CNN Philippines temporarily goes off air for disinfection after confirmed COVID-19 case|url=https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/7/7/cnn-philippines-temporarily-goes-off-air-disinfection-covid-19.html|accessdate=July 11, 2020|work=CNN Philippines|date=July 7, 2020}}</ref> It resumed broadcasting on July 11, 2020.

==Awards and citations==
In April 2016, CNN Philippines bagged 6 awards from the Golden Dove Awards of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas, most notably, the Best Newscaster Award for Newsroom anchor Mitzi Borromeo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/lifestyle/2016/04/30/CNN-Philippines-KBP-Golden-Dove-Awards.html|title=CNN Philippines wins 6 Golden Dove Awards|publisher=CNN Philippines|last=Garcia|first=Pia|date=April 30, 2016|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}</ref> On June 30, 2016, CNN Philippines was recognized as the "Television Station of the Year" in the Rotary Club of Manila Journalism Awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cmfr-phil.org/chronicle/rotary-club-of-manila-awards-journalists-media-orgs/|title=Rotary Club of Manila Awards Journalists, Media Orgs|publisher=CMFR|date=July 8, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref>

During the 6th EdukCircle Awards, [[Pia Hontiveros]] and [[Pinky Webb]] were given a Special Citation for their work on the lone Vice Presidential leg of the [[PiliPinas Debates 2016]].

Two of CNN Philippines' news programs have been recognized by the Asian Academy Creative Awards for national categories in October 15 2020.

"The Source" or "One-on-One with Pinky Webb" won as "Best Current Affairs Programme or Series" while "The Final Word with Rico Hizon" won as "Best News Programme" in the country.<ref>https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/10/15/cnn-philippines-asian-academy-creative-awards.html</ref>

==Digital television==
On January 28, 2016, CNN Philippines through Radio Philippines Network is conducting a DTT testing using ISDB-T on UHF Channel 19 (503.143&nbsp;MHz).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/DTVPilipinas/posts/1325540677471473|title=DTV Pilipinas|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref> One year later in 2017, [[Nine Media Corporation]] together with RPN acquired its UHF transmitter complex in Crestview Heights Subdivision, Brgy. San Roque, [[Antipolo]], [[Rizal]] from [[Progressive Broadcasting Corporation]] to use RPN's [[Digital terrestrial television]] broadcast in [[Metro Manila]] and nearby provinces in preparation of digital television in the Philippines, which is expected to be fully implemented in 2023.

==Programming==
