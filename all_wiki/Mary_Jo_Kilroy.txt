'''Mary Jo Kilroy''' (born April 30, 1949) is the former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OH|15}}, serving from 2009 until 2011. She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from [[Ohio]]. In her first term she introduced a bill to lend $20 million per year to small businesses (HR5322) and an amendment to assign liability to credit reporting agencies. She also contributed to legislation on [[executive pay]]. She was defeated in her November 2, 2010 re-election bid. In 2012 she ran in the newly redrawn, Columbus-based [[Ohio's 3rd congressional district|3rd congressional district]] but lost in the primary.<ref name="2012concession">{{cite web | url=http://www.wtrf.com/story/17096768/ex-state-rep-leading-in-columbus-us-house-primary | title=Ex-US House rep concedes to rival in new district | publisher=WTRF | date=March 6, 2012 | accessdate=March 6, 2012}}</ref>

She is an attorney and a former two-term [[Ohio county government#Board of County Commissioners|County Commissioner]] of [[Franklin County, Ohio]], which includes the capital city of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and some of its surrounding suburban and rural areas. Previously, she served two four-year terms on the Columbus School Board after working in private practice.

In both the [[2006 United States House of Representatives elections|2006]] and [[2008 United States House of Representatives elections]], Kilroy was involved in close elections for [[Ohio's 15th congressional district]]. She lost in 2006 after an election that required the counting of [[absentee ballot]]s and [[election recount]]s. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot voting results. The [[United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2010|2010 election]] race was widely followed in the mainstream press as a race that the Republicans were targeting.
