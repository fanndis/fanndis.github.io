The '''Selma to Montgomery marches''' were three [[Demonstration (protest)|protest marches]], held in 1965, along the 54-mile (87&nbsp;km) highway from [[Selma, Alabama]], to the state capital of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The marches were organized by [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[Activism|activists]] to demonstrate the desire of [[African Americans|African-American]] citizens to exercise their [[constitutional right]] to [[vote]], in defiance of [[segregationist]] repression; they were part of a broader voting rights movement underway in Selma and throughout the [[Southern United States|American South]]. By highlighting racial injustice, they contributed to passage that year of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]], a landmark federal achievement of the [[civil rights movement]].

Southern state legislatures had passed and maintained a series of discriminatory requirements and practices that had [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most of the millions of African Americans across the South throughout the 20th century. The African-American group known as the [[Dallas County Voters League]] (DCVL) launched a voter registration campaign in Selma in 1963. Joined by organizers from the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), they began working that year in a renewed effort to register black voters.

Finding resistance by white officials to be intractable, even after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] ended legal segregation, the DCVL invited Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the activists of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) to join them. SCLC brought many prominent civil rights and civic leaders to Selma in January 1965. Local and regional protests began, with 3,000 people arrested by the end of February.  According to [[Joseph A. Califano Jr.]], who served as head of domestic affairs for [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] between the years 1965 and 1969, the President viewed King as an essential partner in getting the Voting Rights Act enacted.<ref name="califano">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-movie-selma-has-a-glaring-historical-inaccuracy/2014/12/26/70ad3ea2-8aa4-11e4-a085-34e9b9f09a58_story.html|title=The movie 'Selma' has a glaring flaw|date=December 26, 2014|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Joseph A.

On February 26, 1965, activist and deacon [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]] died after being shot several days earlier by state trooper [[James Bonard Fowler]], during a peaceful march in nearby [[Marion, Alabama]]. To defuse and refocus the community's outrage, [[James Bevel]], who was directing SCLC's Selma voting rights movement, called for a march of dramatic length, from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery.<ref>Randall Kryn, "James L. Bevel The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement," In [[David Garrow]]'s 1989 book ''We Shall Overcome, Volume II'', New York: Carlson Publishing Company, 1989.</ref><ref name="cfm40.middlebury.edu">Randy Kryn, [http://cfm40.middlebury.edu/node/287 "Movement Revision Research Summary Regarding James Bevel"], October 2005, [[Middlebury College]].</ref> Bevel had been working on his Alabama Project for voting rights since late 1963.

The first march took place on March 7, 1965, organized locally by Bevel, [[Amelia Boynton Robinson|Amelia Boynton]], and others. State troopers and county [[Posse comitatus (common law)|possemen]] attacked the unarmed marchers with [[Baton (law enforcement)|billy clubs]] and [[tear gas]] after they passed over the county line, and the event became known as '''Bloody Sunday'''.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=March 11, 1965|title=Student March at Nyack|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/03/12/issue.html?pageNumber=19|newspaper=The New York Times|page=19|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name="reed">{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Roy|date=March 6, 1966|title='Bloody Sunday' Was Year Ago|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/03/06/129195742.html?pageNumber=76| newspaper=The New York Times|page=76|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> Law enforcement beat Boynton unconscious, and the media publicized worldwide a picture of her lying wounded on the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]].<ref name="HardyHardy2008">{{cite book|author1=Sheila Jackson Hardy|author2=P.

The second march took place March 9. Troopers, police, and marchers confronted each other at the county end of the bridge, but when the troopers stepped aside to let them pass, King led the marchers back to the church.<ref>{{cite book| last = Branch | first = Taylor | title = The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 2013}}</ref> He was obeying a federal injunction while seeking protection from federal court for the march. That night, a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist [[James Reeb]], a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston, who had come to Selma to march with the second group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uudb.org/articles/jamesjosephreeb.html|title=James Joseph Reeb|website=uudb.org|access-date=2019-07-05}}</ref> Many other clergy and sympathizers from across the country also gathered for the second march.

The violence of "Bloody Sunday" and Reeb's murder resulted in a national outcry and some acts of [[civil disobedience]], targeting both the Alabama and federal governments.  The protesters demanded protection for the Selma marchers and a new federal voting rights law to enable African Americans to register and vote without harassment. President [[Lyndon Johnson]], whose administration had been working on a voting rights law, held a historic, nationally televised [[joint session of Congress]] on March 15 to ask for the bill's introduction and passage.

With Governor Wallace refusing to protect the marchers, President Johnson committed to do so. The third march started on March 21. Protected by 1,900 members of the Alabama National Guard under federal command, and many FBI agents and [[United States Marshals Service|federal marshals]], the marchers averaged 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) a day along [[U.S. Route 80]], known in Alabama as the "[[Jefferson Davis Highway]]". The marchers arrived in Montgomery on March 24 and at the [[Alabama State Capitol]] on March 25.<ref>{{cite book| last = Davis | first = Townsend | title = Weary Feet, Rested Souls | url = https://archive.org/details/wearyfeetresteds00town | url-access = registration | publisher = W.W. Norton | year = 1998}}</ref> With thousands having joined the campaign, 25,000 people entered the capital city that day in support of voting rights.

The route is memorialized as the "Selma To Montgomery Voting Rights Trail", and is designated as a [[National Historic Trail|U.S. National Historic Trail]]. The Voting Rights Act became law on August 6, 1965.

==Selma movement established: 1963–1964==
At the turn of the 20th century, the Alabama state legislature passed a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites by requirements for payment of a [[poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and passing a [[literacy test]] and comprehension of the constitution. Subjective application of the laws effectively closed most blacks out of politics. Selma is a major town and the seat of [[Dallas County, Alabama|Dallas County]], part of the [[Alabama Black Belt]] with a majority-black population. In 1961, the population of Dallas County was 57% black, but of the 15,000 blacks old enough to vote, only 130 were registered (fewer than 1%). At that time, more than 80% of Dallas County blacks lived below the poverty line, most of them working as [[sharecroppers]], farmhands, maids, janitors, and day laborers, but there were also teachers and business owners.<ref name="Selma — Cracking the Wall of Fear">[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963selma1 "Selma — Breaking the Grip of Fear"] ~ Civil Rights Movement Archive.</ref> With the literacy test administered subjectively by white registrars, even educated blacks were prevented from registering or voting.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/info/lithome.htm Are You "Qualified" to Vote? The Alabama "Literacy Test"] ~ Civil Rights Movement Archive.</ref>

Led by the Boynton family ([[Amelia Boynton Robinson|Amelia]], Sam, and son Bruce), Rev. L. L. Anderson, [[J. L. Chestnut]], and [[Marie Foster]], the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL) tried to register black citizens during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Their efforts were blocked by state and local officials, the [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Council]], and the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. By the 1960s, county officials and the Citizens' Council used such tactics as restricted registration hours; economic pressure, including threatening people's jobs, firing them, evicting people from leased homes, and economic boycotts of black-owned businesses; and violence against blacks who tried to register. [[Society of Saint Edmund|The Society of Saint Edmund]], an order of Catholics committed to alleviating poverty and promoting civil rights, were the only whites in Selma who openly supported the voting rights campaign.<ref>[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1898 "Edmundite Southern Missions"], ''Encyclopedia of Alabama''.</ref> [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] staff member Don Jelinek later described this order as "the unsung heroes of the Selma March&nbsp;... who provided the only integrated Catholic church in Selma, and perhaps in the entire [[Deep South]]".<ref>"[http://www.crmvet.org/nars/jelinek.htm#scrufse Don Jelinek, Oral History/Interview, 2005-Selma Underground: Fathers of St. Edmund]", Civil Rights Movement Archive.</ref>

In early 1963, [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] organizers [[Bernard Lafayette]] and [[Colia Clark|Colia Liddel Lafayette]] arrived in Selma to begin a voter-registration project in cooperation with the DCVL.<ref name="Selma — Cracking the Wall of Fear" /> In mid-June, Bernard was beaten and almost killed by [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansmen]] determined to prevent blacks from voting. When the Lafayettes returned to college in the fall, SNCC organizers [[Prathia Hall]] and Worth Long carried on the work despite arrests, beatings, and death threats. When 32 black school teachers applied at the county courthouse to register as voters, they were immediately fired by the all-white school board.
 
After the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Birmingham church bombing]] on September 15, 1963, which killed four black girls, black students in Selma began [[sit-in]]s at local lunch counters to protest segregation; they were physically attacked and arrested. More than 300 were arrested in two weeks of protests, including SNCC Chairman [[John Lewis]].<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm#1963fdselma "Freedom Day in Selma"], Civil Rights Movement Archive.</ref>

On October 7, 1963, one of two days during the month when residents were allowed to go to the courthouse to apply to register to vote, SNCC's [[James Forman]] and the DCVL mobilized more than 300 blacks from Dallas County to line up at the voter registration office in what was called a "Freedom Day". Supporting them were national figures: author [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and his brother David, and comedian [[Dick Gregory]] and his wife Lillian (she was later arrested for picketing with SNCC activists and local supporters). SNCC members who tried to bring water to African Americans waiting on line were arrested, as were those who held signs saying "Register to Vote". After waiting all day in the hot sun, only a handful of the hundreds in the line were allowed to fill out the voter application, and most of those applications were denied by white county officials. United States Justice Department lawyers and [[FBI]] agents were present and observing the scene, but took no action against local officials.<ref name="Zinn 1965">{{cite book |last=Zinn |first=Howard |title=SNCC: The New Abolitionists |publisher=Beacon Press |year=1965|title-link=SNCC: The New Abolitionists}}</ref>

On July 2, 1964, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] into law, prohibiting segregation of public facilities. Some [[Jim Crow laws]] and customs remained in effect in Selma and other places for some time. When activists resumed efforts to integrate Selma's eating and entertainment venues, blacks who tried to attend the movie theater and eat at the hamburger stand were beaten and arrested.

On July 6, 1964, one of the two registration days that month, John Lewis led 50 black citizens to the courthouse, but [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|County Sheriff Jim Clark]] arrested them all instead of allowing them to apply to vote. On July 9, 1964, Judge [[James Hare (judge)|James Hare]] issued an injunction forbidding any gathering of three or more people under the sponsorship of civil rights organizations or leaders. This injunction made it illegal for more than two people at a time to talk about civil rights or voter registration in Selma, suppressing public civil rights activity there for the next six months.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964selmainj "The Selma Injunction"], Civil Rights Movement Archive.</ref>

== 1965 campaign launched ==

===Background===
With civil rights activity blocked by Judge Hare's injunction, [[Frederick D. Reese|Frederick Douglas Reese]] requested the assistance of King and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).<ref name="ari"/> Reese was president of the DCVL, but the group declined to invite the SCLC; the invitation instead came from a group of local activists who would become known as the Courageous Eight – Ulysses S. Blackmon, Sr., [[Amelia Boynton Robinson|Amelia Boynton]], Ernest Doyle, Marie Foster, James Gildersleeve, J.D. Hunter, Sr., Henry Shannon, Sr., and Reese.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4Ej7_RkAJwC&pg=PA9|title=The Selma Campaign, 1963–1965: The Decisive Battle of the Civil Rights Movement|last1=Vaughn|first1=Wally G.|last2=Davis|first2=Mattie Campbell|date=2006-01-01|publisher=The Majority Press|isbn=9780912469447|language=en}}</ref>

Three of SCLC's main organizers – [[James Bevel]], [[Diane Nash]], and [[James Orange]] – had already been working on Bevel's Alabama Voting Rights Project since late 1963. King and the executive board of SCLC had not joined it.<ref name="cfm40.middlebury.edu" /><ref>Randall Kryn, "James L. Bevel The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement", in [[David Garrow]], ''We Shall Overcome, Volume II'', New York: Carlson Publishing Company, 1989.</ref>

When SCLC officially accepted the invitation from the "Courageous Eight", Bevel, Nash, Orange, and others in SCLC began working in Selma in December 1964.<ref name=":0" /> They also worked in the surrounding counties, along with the SNCC staff who had been active there since early 1963.

Since the rejection of voting status for the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] delegates by the regular delegates at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] in Atlantic City, major tensions between SCLC and SNCC had been brewing. SCLC ultimately remained neutral in the MFDP dispute in order to maintain its ties with the national [[Big tent|Democratic coalition]]. Many SNCC members believed they were in an adversarial position with an American establishment which they thought had scorned [[grassroots democracy]]. SNCC's focus was on bottom-up organizing, establishing deep-rooted local power bases through [[community organizing]]. They had become distrustful of SCLC's spectacular mobilizations which were designed to appeal to the national media and Washington DC, but which, most of SNCC believed, did not result in major improvements for the lives of African Americans on the ground.  But, SNCC chairman John Lewis (also an SCLC board member), believed mass mobilizations to be invaluable, and he urged the group to participate.<ref>"[http://crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965selmasnccsclc 1965 – SCLC and SNCC]". Civil Rights Movement Archive</ref> SNCC called in [[Fay Bellamy]] and Silas Norman to be full-time organizers in Selma.<ref name="crmvet.org">"[http://crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965selmainjunction 1965 – Breaking the Selma Injunction]", Civil Right Movement Archive History & Timeline.</ref>

Selma had both moderate and hardline segregationists in its white power structure. The newly elected Mayor [[Joseph Smitherman]] was a moderate who hoped to attract Northern business investment, and he was very conscious of the city's image. Smitherman appointed veteran lawman Wilson Baker to head the city's 30-man police force. Baker believed that the most effective method of undermining civil rights protests was to de-escalate them and deny them publicity, as Police Chief [[Laurie Pritchett]] had done against the [[Albany Movement]] in Georgia. He earned what was described as a grudging respect from activists.

The hardline of segregation was represented by Dallas County [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Sheriff Jim Clark]], who used violence and repression to maintain Jim Crow. He commanded a [[posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] of 200 deputies, some of whom were members of [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters or the [[National States' Rights Party]]. Possemen were armed with electric cattle-prods. Some were mounted on horseback and carried long leather whips they used to lash people on foot. Clark and Chief Baker were known to spar over jurisdiction. Baker's police patrolled the city except for the block of the county courthouse, which Clark and his deputies controlled. Outside the city limits, Clark and his volunteer posse were in complete control in the county.<ref>"[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965m2mmar8 "1965 – Selma on the Eve]", Civil Rights Movement Archive History and Timeline.</ref>

===Events of January===
The Selma Voting Rights Campaign officially started on January 2, 1965, when King addressed a mass meeting in [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church]] in defiance of the anti-meeting injunction.  The date had been chosen because Sheriff Clark was out of town, and Chief Baker had stated he would not enforce the injunction.<ref name="crmvet.org"/> Over the following weeks, SCLC and SNCC activists expanded voter registration drives and protests in Selma and the adjacent [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] counties.

Preparations for mass registration commenced in early January, and with King out of town fundraising, were largely under the leadership of [[Diane Nash]]. On January 15, King called President Johnson and the two agreed to begin a major push for voting rights legislation which would assist in advancing the passage of more anti-poverty legislation.<ref>[http://archive.millercenter.org/presidentialrecordings/lbj-wh6501.04-6736 Johnson Conversation with Martin Luther King on January 15, 1965 (WH6501.04)], [[Miller Center of Public Affairs]]. Accessed September 13, 2017</ref> After King returned to Selma, the first big "Freedom Day" of the new campaign occurred on January 18.

According to their respective strategies, Chief Baker's police were cordial toward demonstrators, but Sheriff Clark refused to let black registrants enter the county courthouse. Clark made no arrests or assaults at this time. However, in an incident that drew national attention, Dr. King was knocked down and kicked by a leader of the National States Rights Party, who was quickly arrested by Chief Baker.<ref name="ReferenceA">"[http://crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965selmacourthouse 1965 – Marching to the Courthouse]". Civil Rights Movement Archive History and Timeline</ref> Baker also arrested the head of the [[American Nazi Party]], [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], who said he'd come to Selma to "run King out of town".<ref>"[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/01/19/page/1/article/king-struck-kicked-during-racial-drive United Press International King Struck, Kicked During Racial Drive]", ''Chicago Tribune,'' January 19, 1965.</ref>

Over the next week, blacks persisted in their attempts to register. Sheriff Clark responded by arresting organizers, including [[Amelia Boynton Robinson|Amelia Boynton]] and [[Hosea Williams]]. Eventually, 225 registrants were arrested as well at the county courthouse. Their cases were handled by the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]]. On January 20, President Johnson gave his inaugural address but did not mention voting rights.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Up to this point, the overwhelming majority of registrants and marchers were sharecroppers, blue-collar workers, and students. On January 22, [[Frederick Reese]], a black schoolteacher who was also DCVL President, finally convinced his colleagues to join the campaign and register en masse. When they refused Sheriff Clark's orders to disperse at the courthouse, an ugly scene commenced. Clark's posse beat the teachers away from the door, but they rushed back only to be beaten again. The teachers retreated after three attempts, and marched to a mass meeting where they were celebrated as heroes by the black community.<ref>"[http://crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965selmateachers 1965 – Teachers March]". Civil Rights Movement Archive History and Timeline.</ref>

On January 25, U.S. District Judge [[Daniel Holcombe Thomas|Daniel Thomas]] issued rules requiring that at least 100 people must be permitted to wait at the courthouse without being arrested. After Dr. King led marchers to the courthouse that morning, Jim Clark began to arrest all registrants in excess of 100, and corral the rest. [[Annie Lee Cooper]], a fifty-three-year-old practical nurse who had been part of the Selma movement since 1963, struck Clark after he twisted her arm, and she knocked him to his knees. Four deputies seized Cooper, and photographers captured images of Clark beating her repeatedly with his club.  The crowd was inflamed and some wanted to intervene against Clark, but King ordered them back as Cooper was taken away. Although Cooper had violated nonviolent discipline, the movement rallied around her.

[[James Bevel]], speaking at a mass meeting, deplored her actions because "then [the press] don't talk about the registration."<ref>"[http://crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965selmacooper 1965 – Annie Cooper and Sheriff Clark]". Civil Rights Movement Archive History and Timeline.</ref> But when asked about the incident by [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'']] magazine, Bevel said, "Not everybody who registers is nonviolent; not everybody who registers is supposed to be nonviolent."<ref name="Jet, February 11, 1965">{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcADAAAAMBAJ&q=%22not+everybody+who+registers%22|page=8|magazine=Jet|date=February 11, 1965|title=Selma Woman's Girdle a Big Factor in Fight with Sheriff|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref> The incident between Clark and Cooper was a media sensation, putting the campaign on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>David Garrow, ''Protest at Selma'' (Yale University Press, 1978), p. 45.</ref> When asked if she would do it again, Cooper told ''Jet,'' "I try to be nonviolent, but I just can't say I wouldn't do the same thing all over again if they treat me brutish like they did this time."<ref name="Jet, February 11, 1965"/>

===Events of February===
Dr. King decided to make a conscious effort to get arrested, for the benefit of publicity. On February 1, King and [[Ralph Abernathy]] refused to cooperate with Chief Baker's traffic directions on the way to the courthouse, calculating that Baker would arrest them, putting them in the Selma city jail run by Baker's police, rather than the county jail run by Clark's deputies. Once processed, King and Abernathy refused to post bond. On the same day, SCLC and SNCC organizers took the campaign outside of Dallas County for the first time; in nearby Perry County 700 students and adults, including [[James Orange]], were arrested.<ref name="ReferenceB">"[http://crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965selmaletter 1965 – Letter from a Selma Jail]", Civil Rights Movement Archive History and Timeline.</ref>

On the same day, students from [[Tuskegee Institute]], working in cooperation with SNCC, were arrested for acts of civil disobedience in solidarity with the Selma campaign.<ref>"[http://www.crmvet.org/docs/6502_sncc_ala_struggle.pdf The Alabama Struggle]".

After the assault on Dr. King by the white supremacist in January, [[black nationalist]] leader [[Malcolm X]] had sent an open telegram to [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], stating: "if your present racist agitation against our people there in Alabama causes physical harm&nbsp;... you and your KKK friends will be met with maximum physical retaliation from those of us who&nbsp;... believe in asserting our right to self-defense [[by any means necessary]]."<ref>Christopher Strain, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EAhHl-0ERn8C&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=malcolm+x,+george+lincoln+rockwell,+telegram&source=bl&ots=EeocwaU5IF&sig=0qsXCspnsUS9bPOLYN8n0UrkCso&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WNMxUpHGI4Ps8QSxn4HQBg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=malcolm%20x%2C%20george%20lincoln%20rockwell%2C%20telegram&f=false ''Pure Fire: Self-Defense as Activism in the Civil Rights Era''] (University of Georgia Press, 2005), pp. 92–93.</ref> [[Fay Bellamy]] and Silas Norman attended a talk by Malcolm X to 3,000 students at the [[Tuskegee Institute]], and invited him to address a mass meeting at Brown Chapel A.M.E.

That February 4, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] made his first public statement in support of the Selma campaign. At midday, Judge Thomas, at the Justice Department's urging, issued an injunction that suspended Alabama's current literacy test, ordered Selma to take at least 100 applications per registration day, and guaranteed that all applications received by June 1 would be processed before July.<ref name="Taylor Branch 1999 p. 578-579"/> In response to Thomas' favorable ruling, and in alarm at Malcolm X's visit, [[Andrew Young]], who was not in charge of the Selma movement, said he would suspend demonstrations.

Overall more than 3,000 people were arrested in protests between January 1 and February 7, but blacks achieved fewer than 100 new registered voters. In addition, hundreds of people were injured or blacklisted by employers due to their participation in the campaign. DCLV activists became increasingly wary of SCLC's protests, preferring to wait and see if Judge Thomas' ruling of February 4 would make a long-term difference. SCLC was less concerned with Dallas County's immediate registration figures, and primarily focused on creating a public crisis that would make a voting rights bill the White House's number one priority. James Bevel and [[C. T. Vivian]] both led dramatic nonviolent confrontations at the courthouse in the second week of February.

==First Selma-to-Montgomery march==

===Jimmie Lee Jackson's murder===
{{main|Jimmie Lee Jackson}}
On February 18, 1965, [[C. T. Vivian]] led a march to the courthouse in [[Marion, Alabama|Marion]], the county seat of neighboring [[Perry County, Alabama|Perry County]], to protest the arrest of James Orange. State officials had received orders to target Vivian, and a line of [[Alabama Highway Patrol|Alabama state troopers]] waited for the marchers at the Perry County courthouse.<ref>Halberstam, David. ''The Children,'' Random House, 1998, p. 502.</ref> Officials had turned off all of the nearby street lights, and state troopers rushed at the protesters, attacking them. Protesters [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]] and his mother fled the scene to hide in a nearby café. Alabama State Trooper corporal [[James Bonard Fowler]] followed Jackson into the café and shot him, saying he thought the protester was trying to get his gun as they grappled. Jackson died eight days later at Selma's Good Samaritan Hospital, of an [[infection]] resulting from the gunshot wound.<ref name="fleming">{{Cite news |last=Fleming |first=John |title=The Death of Jimmie Lee Jackson |newspaper=[[The Anniston Star]] |date=March 6, 2005 |url=http://www.annistonstar.com/view/full_story/2746471/article-The-Death-of-Jimmie-Lee-Jackson?instance=special |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124111458/http://annistonstar.com/view/full_story/2746471/article-The-Death-of-Jimmie-Lee-Jackson?instance=special |archive-date=November 24, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Jackson was the only male wage-earner of his household, which lived in [[extreme poverty]]. Jackson's father, mother, wife, and children were left with no source of income.

===Initiation and goals of the march===
During a public meeting at Zion United Methodist Church in Marion on February 28 after Jackson's death, emotions were running high. James Bevel, as director of the Selma voting rights movement for SCLC, called for a march from Selma to Montgomery to talk to Governor [[George Wallace]] directly about Jackson's death, and to ask him if he had ordered the State Troopers to turn off the lights and attack the marchers. Bevel strategized that this would focus the anger and pain of the people of Marion and Selma toward a nonviolent goal, as many were so outraged they wanted to retaliate with violence.<ref>Kryn in Garrow, 1989.</ref><ref>Kryn, 2005.</ref>

The marchers also hoped to bring attention to the continued violations of their [[United States Constitution|Constitutional rights]] by marching to Montgomery. Dr. King agreed with Bevel's plan of the march, which they both intended to symbolize a march for full voting rights. They were to ask Governor Wallace to protect black registrants.

SNCC had severe reservations about the march, especially when they heard that King would not be present.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965selmatension |title=1965-Tensions Escalate |work=Civil Rights Movement Archive History and Timeline |accessdate=8 September 2019 }}</ref> They permitted John Lewis to participate, and SNCC provided logistical support, such as the use of its [[Wide Area Telephone Service]] (WATS) lines and the services of the Medical Committee on Human Rights, organized by SNCC during the Mississippi Summer Project of 1964.<ref>[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1847 "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Alabama (SNCC)"], ''Encyclopedia of Alabama''.</ref>

Governor Wallace denounced the march as a threat to public safety; he said that he would take all measures necessary to prevent it from happening. "There will be no march between Selma and Montgomery," Wallace said on March 6, 1965, citing concern over traffic violations. He ordered Alabama Highway Patrol Chief Col. [[Albert J. Lingo|Al Lingo]] to "use whatever measures are necessary to prevent a march".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/03/06/Obama-Selma-to-mark-50th-anniversary-of-historic-civil-rights-march/8311425489759/ |title=Obama, Selma to mark 50th anniversary of historic civil rights march |first=Andrew V. |last=Pestano |date=6 March 2015 |accessdate=12 March 2015 |work=[[United Press International|UPI]] }}</ref>

=== "Bloody Sunday" events ===
On March 7, 1965, an estimated 525 to 600 civil rights marchers headed southeast out of Selma on [[U.S. Highway 80]]. The march was led by [[John Lewis]] of SNCC and the Reverend [[Hosea Williams]] of SCLC, followed by [[Bob Mants]] of SNCC and [[Albert Turner (civil rights activist)|Albert Turner]] of SCLC. The protest went according to plan until the marchers crossed the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]], where they encountered a wall of [[state trooper]]s and county posse waiting for them on the other side.

County sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]] had issued an order for all white males in Dallas County over the age of twenty-one to report to the courthouse that morning to be deputized. Commanding officer John Cloud told the demonstrators to disband at once and go home. Rev. Hosea Williams tried to speak to the officer, but Cloud curtly informed him there was nothing to discuss. Seconds later, the troopers began shoving the demonstrators, knocking many to the ground and beating them with [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]]s. Another detachment of troopers fired [[tear gas]], and mounted troopers charged the crowd on horseback.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/civilrights/cost.htm "The Cost", ''We Shall Overcome: Historic Places of the Civil Rights Movement''], National Park Service.</ref><ref>Gary May, ''Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy'' (Basic Books, 2013).</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

Televised images of the brutal attack presented Americans and international audiences with horrifying images of marchers left bloodied and severely injured, and roused support for the Selma Voting Rights Campaign. [[Amelia Boynton Robinson|Amelia Boynton]], who had helped organize the march as well as marching in it, was beaten unconscious.

===Response to "Bloody Sunday"===
After the march, President Johnson issued an immediate statement "deploring the brutality with which a number of Negro citizens of Alabama were treated". He also promised to send a voting rights bill to Congress that week, although it took him until March 15.<ref name="Dallek-Robert-flawed-giant-lbj-215-217">{{cite book|title=Flawed Giant Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961–1973|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199771905|location=New York|pages=215–217|last1=Dallek|first1=Robert}}</ref>

SNCC officially joined the Selma campaign, putting aside their qualms about SCLC's tactics in order to rally for "the fundamental right of protest".<ref>Taylor Branch, ''At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years 1965–1968'' (Simon & Schuster, 2006), p. 73.</ref> SNCC members independently organized sit-ins in Washington, DC, the following day, occupying the office of Attorney General [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] until they were dragged away.<ref>Branch, ''At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years 1965–1968'' (2006), pp. 59–65.</ref>

The Executive Board of the NAACP unanimously passed a resolution the day after "Bloody Sunday", warning, 
<blockquote>If Federal troops are not made available to protect the rights of Negroes, then the American people are faced with terrible alternatives.  Like the citizens of Nazi-occupied France, Negroes must either submit to the heels of their oppressors or they must organize underground to protect themselves from the oppression of Governor Wallace and his storm troopers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5lcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA247&lpg=PA247&dq=%E2%80%9CSelma+Outrage+Condemned,%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=TEM0dFUbju&sig=DQ4-7lAacIepa_2Cj0ThV9rTYXE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=a7psVKj9KLX7sASqzIGQBQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CSelma%20Outrage%20Condemned%2C%E2%80%9D&f=false "Selma Outrage Condemned"], ''The Crisis,'' Vol. 72, No. 4, April 1965.</ref></blockquote>In response to "Bloody Sunday," labor leader [[Walter Reuther]] sent a telegram on March 9 to President Johnson, reading in part:<blockquote>Americans of all religious faiths, of all political persuasions, and from every section of our Nation are deeply shocked and outraged at the tragic events in Selma Ala., and they look to the Federal Government as the only possible source to protect and guarantee the exercise of constitutional rights, which is being denied and destroyed by the Dallas County law enforcement agents and the Alabama State troops under the direction of Governor George Wallace.

Under these circumstances, Mr President, I join in urging you to take immediate and appropriate steps including the use of Federal marshals and troops if necessary, so that the full exercise of constitutional rights including free assembly and free speech be fully protected.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Congress|first=United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f03LYrZHFKwC&q=reuther&pg=PA5304|title=Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the ...

==Second march: "Turnaround Tuesday"==

Bevel, King, Nash, and others began organizing a second march to be held on Tuesday, March 9, 1965. They issued a call for clergy and citizens from across the country to join them. Awakened to issues of civil and voting rights by years of [[Civil Rights Movement]] activities, and shocked by the television images of "Bloody Sunday," hundreds of people responded to SCLC's call.

To prevent another outbreak of violence, SCLC attempted to gain a [[court order]] that would prohibit the police from interfering. Instead of issuing the court order, U.S. District Court Judge [[Frank Minis Johnson]] issued a [[restraining order]], prohibiting the march from taking place until he could hold additional hearings later in the week.

Based on past experience, some in SCLC were confident that Judge Johnson would eventually lift the restraining order. They did not want to alienate one of the few southern judges who had displayed sympathy to their cause by violating his injunction. In addition, they did not yet have sufficient infrastructure in place to support the long march, one for which the marchers were ill-equipped. They knew that violating a court order could result in punishment for contempt, even if the order is later reversed.<ref>See ''Walker v. City of Birmingham,'' 388 U.S. 307 1967, citing ''Howat v. Kansas'', 258 U.S. 181 (1922).</ref>  But some movement activists, both local and from around the country, were determined to march on Tuesday to protest both the "Bloody Sunday" violence and the systematic denial of black voting rights in Alabama. Both Hosea Williams and James Forman argued that the march must proceed and by the early morning of the march date, and after much debate, Dr. King had decided to lead people to Montgomery.

Assistant Attorney General John Doar and former Florida governor [[LeRoy Collins]], representing President [[Lyndon Johnson]], went to Selma to meet with King and others at [[Richie Jean Jackson]]'s house<ref name="preserve"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://alabama.travel/road-trips/selma-to-montgomery-crossing-a-bridge-into-history|title=Selma to Montgomery: Crossing a Bridge Into History - Alabama Road Trips - Alabama.Travel|work=Alabama's Official Travel Guide}}</ref> and privately urged King to postpone the march. The SCLC president told them that his conscience demanded that he proceed, and that many movement supporters, especially in SNCC, would go ahead with the march even if he told them it should be called off. Collins suggested to King that he make a symbolic witness at the bridge, then turn around and lead the marchers back to Selma. King told them that he would try to enact the plan provided that Collins could ensure that law enforcement would not attack them. Collins obtained this guarantee from Sheriff Clark and Al Lingo in exchange for a guarantee that King would follow a precise route drawn up by Clark.<ref name="books.google.com">David Garrow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VmmrBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT851&dq=bearing+the+cross&hl=en&sa=X&ei=T90aVf66NIP5yQSKrIGACw&ved=0CCAQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=leroy%20collins%2C%20lingo%2C%20clark&f=false ''Bearing the Cross''] (Vintage edition, 1993), pp. 401–405.</ref>

[[Image:Bloody Sunday-officers await demonstrators.jpeg|thumb|right|240px|Police watch marchers turn around on Tuesday, March 9, 1965.]]
On the morning of March 9, a day that would become known as "Turnaround Tuesday",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/chronologyentry/1965_03_09|title=Martin Luther King and the Global Freedom Struggle |publisher=[[Stanford University#Research centers and institutes|Stanford University {{!}} Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute]] |access-date=October 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913193059/http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/chronologyentry/1965_03_09|archive-date=September 13, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Collins handed Dr. King the secretly agreed route. King led about 2,500 marchers out on the Edmund Pettus Bridge and held a short prayer session before turning them around, thereby obeying the court order preventing them from making the full march, and following the agreement made by Collins, Lingo, and Clark. He did not venture across the border into the unincorporated area of the county, even though the police unexpectedly stood aside to let them enter.<ref name="books.google.com"/><ref>Eliza Berman, [http://time.com/3733726/leroy-collins-selma/  "How a Little-Known Government Agency Kept the Peace in Selma"], ''Time'', March 25, 2015.</ref>

As only [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] leaders had been told in advance of the plan, many marchers felt confusion and consternation, including those who had traveled long distances to participate and oppose police brutality. King asked them to remain in Selma for another march to take place after the injunction was lifted.

That evening, three white Unitarian Universalist ministers in Selma for the march were attacked on the street and beaten with clubs by four [[KKK]] members.<ref name="The March to Montgomery">[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm The March to Montgomery] ~ Civil Rights Movement Archive.</ref> The worst injured was Reverend [[James Reeb]] from [[Boston]]. Fearing that Selma's public hospital would refuse to treat Reeb, activists took him to Birmingham's University Hospital, two hours away. Reeb died on Thursday, March 11 at University Hospital, with his wife by his side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/witnesses/reeb.htm |title=James Reeb |first=Neil |last=Baumgartner |work=Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia |publisher=[[Ferris State University]] |date=December 2012 |access-date=2015-01-16}}</ref>

===Response to the second march===
James Reeb's death provoked mourning throughout the country, and tens of thousands held vigils in his honor. President Johnson called Reeb's widow and father to express his condolences (he would later invoke Reeb's memory when he delivered a draft of the Voting Rights Act to Congress).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/reeb-james|title="James Reeb" King Encyclopedia |access-date=December 4, 2019 }}</ref>

Blacks in Dallas County and the Black Belt mourned the death of Reeb, as they had earlier mourned the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson. But many activists were bitter that the media and national political leaders expressed great concern over the murder of Reeb, a northern white in Selma, but had paid scant attention to that of Jackson, a local African American. [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] organizer [[Stokely Carmichael]] argued that "the movement itself is playing into the hands of [[racism]], because what you want as a nation is to be upset when anybody is killed [but] for it to be recognized, a white person must be killed. Well, what are you saying?"<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_106.html "Bridge to Freedom" episode], ''Eyes on the Prize'' series, PBS_WGBH.</ref>
[[File:Plaque J Reeb.jpg|thumb|Monument for James Reeb in Selma, Alabama]]
Dr. King's credibility in the movement was shaken by the secret turnaround agreement. [[David Garrow]] notes that King publicly "waffled and dissembled" on how his final decision had been made. On some occasions King would inaccurately claim that "no pre-arranged agreement existed", but under oath before Judge Johnson, he acknowledged that there had been a "tacit agreement". Criticism of King by radicals in the movement became increasingly pronounced, with James Forman calling Turnaround Tuesday, "a classic example of trickery against the people".<ref name="books.google.com"/>

====Actions in Montgomery====
[[File:James Forman in Montgomery, March 1965.jpg|thumb|James Forman in Montgomery, March 1965]]
With the second march turned and its organizers awaiting a judicial order to safely proceed, [[Tuskegee Institute]] students, led by Gwen Patton and [[Sammy Younge Jr.]], decided to open a "Second Front" by marching to the [[Alabama State Capitol]] and delivering a petition to Governor Wallace. They were quickly joined by [[James Forman]] and much of the SNCC staff from Selma. The SNCC members distrusted King more than ever after the "turnaround", and were eager to take a separate course.  On March 11, SNCC began a series of demonstrations in Montgomery, and put out a national call for others to join them. [[James Bevel]], SCLC's Selma leader, followed them and discouraged their activities, bringing him and SCLC into conflict with Forman and SNCC. Bevel accused Forman of trying to divert people from the Selma campaign and of abandoning nonviolent discipline. Forman accused Bevel of driving a wedge between the student movement and the local black churches. The argument was resolved only when both were arrested.<ref>[http://crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965m2mtial1 "1965-Students March in Montgomery; Confrontation at Dexter Church"], Civil Rights Movement Archive History and Timeline.</ref>

On March 15 and 16, SNCC led several hundred demonstrators, including Alabama students, Northern students, and local adults, in protests near the capitol complex. The Montgomery County sheriff's posse met them on horseback and drove them back, whipping them. Against the objections of James Bevel, some protesters threw bricks and bottles at police. At a mass meeting on the night of the 16th, Forman "whipped the crowd into a frenzy" demanding that the President act to protect demonstrators, and warned, "If we can't sit at the table of democracy, we'll knock the fucking legs off."<ref>Gary May, ''Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy'' (Basic Books, 2013), pp. 107, 126.</ref><ref>[http://crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965m2mtial2 "1965-Protests and Police Violence Continue in Montgomery; Brutal Attack in Montgomery"], Civil Rights Movement Archive History and Timeline.</ref>

According to historian Gary May, "City officials, also worried by the violent turn of events&nbsp;... apologized for the assault on SNCC protesters and invited King and Forman to discuss how to handle future protests in the city."  In the negotiations, Montgomery officials agreed to stop using the county posse against protesters, and to issue march permits to blacks for the first time.<ref>May, [https://archive.org/details/bendingtowardjus0000mayg <!-- quote="table of democracy". --> ''Bending Toward Justice''] (2013), p. 129.</ref>

Governor Wallace did not negotiate, however. He continued to have state police arrest any demonstrators who ventured onto Alabama State property of the capitol complex.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

====Actions at the White House====

On March 12, President Johnson had an unusually belligerent meeting with a group of civil rights advocates including [[Bishop Paul Moore]], [[Robert Spike|Reverend Robert Spike]], and SNCC representative [[H. Rap Brown]]. Johnson complained that the White House protests were disturbing his family. The activists were unsympathetic and demanded to know why he hadn't delivered the voting rights bill to Congress yet, or sent federal troops to Alabama to protect the protesters.<ref>[http://www.thenation.com/article/h-rap-brownjamil-al-amin-profoundly-american-story Ekwueme Michael Thelwell, "H.

President Johnson told the press that he refused to be "blackjacked" into action by unruly "pressure groups".<ref>Robert Young, [http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/03/13/page/34/article/a-kind-of-anger "Johnson won't be 'blackjacked into force by pressure groups{{'"}}], ''Chicago Tribune,'' March 13, 1965.</ref> The next day he arranged a personal meeting with Governor Wallace, urging him to use the [[Alabama National Guard]] to protect marchers. He also began preparing the final draft of his [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|voting rights bill]].<ref name="Dallek-Robert-flawed-giant-lbj-215-217"/>

On March 11, Attorney General Katzenbach announced that the federal government was intending to prosecute local and state officials who were responsible for the attacks on the marchers on March 7.<ref>John D.

====Johnson's decision and the Voting Rights Act====
On March 15, the president convened a joint session of Congress, outlined his new voting rights bill, and demanded that they pass it. In a historic presentation carried nationally on live television, making use of the largest media network, Johnson praised the courage of African-American activists. He called Selma "a turning point in man's unending search for freedom" on a par with the [[Battle of Appomattox]] in the [[American Civil War]]. Johnson added that his entire [[Great Society]] program, not only the voting rights bill, was part of the Civil Rights Movement. He adopted language associated with Dr. King, declaring that "it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we ''shall'' overcome."<ref>[http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/speeches.hom/650315.asp "President Lyndon B.

[[Joseph Ellwanger]] is standing in the second row behind the nun.]]

A week after Reeb's death, on Wednesday March 17, Judge Johnson ruled in favor of the protesters, saying their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to march in protest could not be abridged by the state of Alabama:

<blockquote>The law is clear that the [[right to petition]] one's government for the redress of grievances may be exercised in large groups . ... These rights may ... be exercised by marching, even along public highways.<ref>''Williams v. Wallace'', 240 F. Supp. 100, 106 (M.D. Ala. 1960).</ref></blockquote>

Judge Johnson had sympathized with the protesters for some days, but had withheld his order until he received an iron-clad commitment of enforcement from the White House. President Johnson had avoided such a commitment in sensitivity to the power of the [[state's rights]] movement, and attempted to cajole Governor Wallace into protecting the marchers himself, or at least giving the president permission to send troops. Finally, seeing that Wallace had no intention of doing either, the president gave his commitment to Judge Johnson on the morning of March 17, and the judge issued his order the same day.<ref>Gary May, ''Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy'' (Basic Books, 2013), pp. 127–128.</ref> To ensure that this march would not be as unsuccessful as the first two marches were, the president federalized the Alabama National Guard on March 20 to escort the march from Selma,<ref name=califanoselma/><ref>Dallek, Robert (1998).

On Sunday, March 21, close to 8,000 people assembled at Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church to commence the trek to Montgomery.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/semo Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail] – National Park Service.</ref> Most of the participants were black, but some were white and some were Asian and Latino. Spiritual leaders of multiple races, religions, and creeds marched abreast with Dr. King, including Rev. [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], Greek Orthodox [[Archbishop Iakovos of America|Archbishop Iakovos]], Rabbis [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] and [[Maurice Davis (rabbi)|Maurice Davis]], and at least one [[nun]], all of whom were depicted in a photo that has become famous.<ref name="The March to Montgomery"/> The Dutch [[Catholic]] priest [[Henri Nouwen]] joined the march on March 24.<ref>Nouwen, Henri (2008).

In 1965, the road to Montgomery was four lanes wide going east from Selma, then narrowed to two lanes through [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County]], and widened to four lanes again at the Montgomery county border. Under the terms of Judge Johnson's order, the march was limited to no more than 300 participants for the two days they were on the two-lane portion of Highway-80. At the end of the first day, most of the marchers returned to Selma by bus and car, leaving 300 to camp overnight and take up the journey the next day.

On March 22 and 23, 300 protesters marched through chilling rain across Lowndes County, camping at three sites in muddy fields. At the time of the march, the population of Lowndes County was 81% black and 19% white, but not a single black was registered to vote.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cobb |first=Charles E. |title=On the Road to Freedom |url=https://archive.org/details/onroadtofreedomg00cobb |url-access=registration |publisher=Algonquin Books |year=2008}}</ref> There were 2,240 whites registered to vote in Lowndes County,<ref>https://libraries.ucsd.edu/farmworkermovement/ufwarchives/sncc/13-June%201966.pdf</ref> a figure that represented 118% of the adult white population (in many Southern counties of that era it was common practice to retain white voters on the rolls after they died or moved away). On March 23, Hundreds of black marchers wore [[Kippah|''kippot'']], Jewish skullcaps, to emulate the marching rabbis, as [[Abraham Joshua Heschel|Heschel]] was marching at the front of the crowd. The marchers called the ''kippot'' "freedom caps."<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 23, 1965 |title=Negro Marchers from Selma Wear 'Yarmulkes' in Deference to Rabbis |url=https://www.jta.org/1965/03/23/archive/negro-marchers-from-selma-wear-yarmulkes-in-deference-to-rabbis |agency=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |access-date=April 11, 2019}}</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Selma montgomery marcher.jpg|thumb|alt=A native [[Selmian]] expresses her desire for change.|A native [[Selmian]] expresses her desire for change.]] -->On the morning of March 24, the march crossed into Montgomery County and the highway widened again to four lanes. All day as the march approached the city, additional marchers were ferried by bus and car to join the line. By evening, several thousand marchers had reached the final campsite at the [[City of St. Jude]], a complex on the outskirts of Montgomery.

That night on a makeshift stage, a "Stars for Freedom" rally was held, with singers [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Nina Simone]], and [[The Chad Mitchell Trio]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Doug |date=January 18, 2015 |title=King letter of thanks hangs on his wall |url=http://m.spokesman.com/stories/2015/jan/18/doug-clark-king-letter-of-thanks-hangs-on-his-wall/ |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, WA |access-date=June 7, 2015 }}</ref> all performing.<ref>{{cite news |title=City of St. Jude is just wild about Harry |first=Mike|last=Tankersley|url=http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20120325/NEWS01/303250031 |newspaper=[[Montgomery Advertiser]] |date=March 25, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2013}}</ref> Thousands more people continued to join the march.

On Thursday, March 25, 25,000 people marched from St. Jude to the steps of the [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol Building]] where King delivered the speech "[[How Long, Not Long]]". He said:

<blockquote>The end we seek is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live with its conscience. ... I know you are asking today, How long will it take? I come to say to you this afternoon however difficult the moment, however frustrating the hour, it will not be long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/selma_montgomery.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122214150/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/selma_montgomery.htm|title=Selma to Montgomery March|archive-date=January 22, 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

After delivering the speech, King and the marchers approached the entrance to the capitol with a petition for Governor Wallace. A line of state troopers blocked the door. One announced that the governor was not in. Undeterred, the marchers remained at the entrance until one of Wallace's secretaries appeared and took the petition.<ref>Mallon, Jack (March 6, 2015).

Later that night, [[Viola Liuzzo]], a white mother of five from Detroit who had come to Alabama to support voting rights for blacks, was assassinated by [[Ku Klux Klan]] members while she was ferrying marchers back to Selma from Montgomery. Among the Klansmen in the car from which the shots were fired was FBI informant Gary Rowe. Afterward, the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] operation spread false rumors that Liuzzo was a member of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African-American activists.<ref>Mary Stanton, ''FROM SELMA TO SORROW: The Life and Death of Viola Liuzzo,'' University of Georgia Press, 2000.</ref>

===Response to the third march ===
The third Selma march received national and international coverage. It was reported that it publicized the marchers' message without harassment by police and segregation supporters. Gaining more widespread support from other civil rights organizations in the area, this third march was considered an overall success, with greater degree of influence on the public. Subsequently, voter registration drives were organized in black-majority areas across the South, but it took time to get the target population to sign up.

U.S. Representative [[William Louis Dickinson]] made two speeches to Congress on March 30 and April 27, saying that there was [[alcohol abuse]], [[bribery]], and widespread sexual license among the marchers. Religious leaders present at the marches denied the allegations, and local and national journalists found no grounds for his accounts. The allegations of segregation supporters were collected in Robert M. Mikell's pro-segregationist book ''Selma'' (Charlotte, 1965).<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/legal/Hilbink/250/Jane%20Dailey%20-%20Sex,%20Segregation,%20and%20the%20Sacred%20after%20Brown.pdf Jane Daily, "Sex, Segregation, and the Sacred after Brown"], ''The Journal of American History,'' 91.1.

On March 26, 1965, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee called for a national boycott of Hammermill paper products, until the company reversed what SNCC described as racist policies. The SCLC joined in support of the boycott.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jsEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=Hammermill+Paper+Boycott&source=bl&ots=2mVIssdBBq&sig=BvG6S2Kn632rdpJsWfUvziuH9kg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PeFKT_7TCoWWgwel7Z2nDg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Hammermill%20Paper%20Boycott&f=false  Negro Boycott of Hammermill].

White activist and preacher [[Robert W. Spike]] called Hammermill's decision as "an affront not only to 20 million American Negroes, but also to all citizens of goodwill in this country." He also criticized Hammermill executives directly, stating: "For the board chairman of one of America's largest paper manufacturers to sit side by side with Governor Wallace of Alabama and say that Selma is fine ... is either the height of naiveté or the depth of racism."<ref>[https://www.eriereader.com/article/from-erie-to-selma-in-1965  From Erie to Selma].

The marches had a powerful effect in Washington. After witnessing TV coverage of "Bloody Sunday", President [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] met with Governor [[George Wallace]] in Washington to discuss the civil rights situation in his state. He tried to persuade Wallace to stop the state harassment of the protesters. Two nights later, on March 15, 1965, Johnson presented a bill to a joint session of Congress. The bill was passed that summer and signed by Johnson as the [[Voting Rights Act]] on August 6, 1965.<ref name=Bending>{{cite book|last=May|first=Gary|title=Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-01846-8|date=April 9, 2013|edition=Kindle|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bendingtowardjus0000mayg}}</ref>{{rp|168}}

Johnson's televised speech before Congress was carried nationally; it was considered to be a watershed moment for the civil rights movement. He said:

<blockquote>Even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life. Their cause must be our cause, too, because it is not just Negroes but really it is all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.

Many in the Civil Rights Movement cheered the speech and were emotionally moved that after so long, and so hard a struggle, a President was finally willing to defend voting rights for blacks. According to [[C.T. Vivian]], an [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] activist who was with King at [[Richie Jean Jackson]]'s home when the speech was broadcast,

<blockquote>I looked over&nbsp;... and Martin was very quietly sitting in the chair, and a tear ran down his cheek.  It was a victory like none other. It was an affirmation of the movement.<ref name="Rubel 2002"/><ref name="tambaya.obenson">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/niecy-nash-signs-up-to-play-richie-jean-jackson-in-ava-duvernays-selma|title=Niecy Nash Signs Up To Play Richie Jean Jackson In Ava Du - Shadow and Act|author=Tambay A.

Many others in the movement remained skeptical of the White House, believing that Johnson was culpable for having allowed violence against the movement in the early months of the campaign and was not a reliable supporter. Neither Jimmie Lee Jackson's murderer, nor Reverend Reeb's was ever prosecuted by the federal government.<ref>[http://crmvet.org/tim/timhis65.htm#1965m2mlbjwso "1965-President Johnson: We Shall Overcome"], Civil Rights Movement Archive History and Timeline.</ref><ref>[http://thegrio.com/2011/03/11/fbi-investigating-65-killing-of-minister/ "FBI investigating '65 killing of pro-civil rights minister"], ''The Grio''.</ref> [[J.L. Chestnut]], reflecting the view of many Selma activists, feared that the president had "outfoxed" and "co-opted" King and the SCLC. James Forman quipped that by quoting "We Shall Overcome", Johnson had simply "spoiled a good song".<ref>Gary May, ''Bending Toward Justice'', p. 125.</ref> Such grassroots activists were more determined than ever to remain independent in their political organizing.

Before the march to Montgomery concluded, SNCC staffers [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[Cleveland Sellers]] committed themselves to registering voters in [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County]] for the next year. Their efforts resulted in the creation of the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]], an independent third party.<ref>[http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/kingweb/about_king/encyclopedia/carmichael_stokely.html "Stokely Carmichael"].

The bill was signed by President Johnson in an August 6 ceremony attended by [[Amelia Boynton Robinson|Amelia Boynton]] and many other civil rights leaders and activists. This act prohibited most of the unfair practices used to prevent blacks from registering to vote, and provided for federal registrars to go to Alabama and other states with a history of voting-related discrimination to ensure that the law was implemented by overseeing registration and elections.

In the early years of the Act, overall progress was slow, with local registrars continuing to use their power to deny African Americans voting access. In most Alabama counties, for example, registration continued to be limited to two days per month.<ref>[http://crmvet.org/tim/tim65b.htm#65scope_vr "1965-SCOPE Voter Registration"].

In the summer of 1965, a well-funded SCLC decided to join SNCC and CORE in massive on-the-ground voter registration programs in the South. The Civil Rights Commission described this as a major contribution to expanding black voters in 1965, and the Justice Department acknowledged leaning on the work of "local organizations" in the movement to implement the Act.<ref name="law.umaryland.edu"/> SCLC and SNCC were temporarily able to mend past differences through collaboration in the [[SCOPE Project|Summer Community Organization & Political Education project]]. Ultimately, their coalition foundered on SCLC's commitment to nonviolence and (at the time) the Democratic Party.<ref>[http://crmvet.org/tim/tim65b.htm#65scope_sncc "1965-SCLC/SCOPE and SNCC"].

By March 1966, nearly 11,000 blacks had registered to vote in Selma, where 12,000 whites were registered.<ref name="reed"/> More blacks would register by November, when their goal was to replace County Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]]; his opponent was Wilson Baker, for whom they had respect. In addition, five blacks ran for office in Dallas County. Rev. [[P. H. Lewis]], pastor of [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church]], ran for state representative on the Democratic ticket. David Ellwanger, a brother of [[Joseph Ellwanger|Rev. Joseph Ellwanger]] of Birmingham, who led supporters in Selma in 1965, challenged incumbent state senator [[Walter C. Givhan]] (d. 1976), a fierce segregationist and a power in the state senate.<ref name="reed"/> First elected to the state senate in 1954, Givhan retained his seat for six terms, even after redistricting that preceded the 1966 election.<ref>[http://agriculture.auburn.edu/people/walter-c-givhan/ "Walter C. Givhan"], Auburn University, 2015, accessed 12 March 2015</ref>

In November 1966, Katzenbach told Johnson regarding Alabama, that "I am attempting to do the least I can do safely without upsetting the civil rights groups." Katzenbach did concentrate examiners and observers in Selma for the "high-visibility" election between incumbent County Sheriff Jim Clark and Wilson Baker, who had earned the grudging respect of many local residents and activists.<ref>Taylor Branch, ''At Canaan's Edge,'' p. 461</ref> With 11,000 blacks added to the voting rolls in Selma by March 1966, they voted for Baker in 1966, turning Clark out of office.

Overall, the Justice Department assigned registrars to six of Alabama's 24 Black Belt counties during the late 1960s, and to fewer than one-fifth of all the Southern counties covered by the Act.<ref name="auto"/> Expansion of enforcement grew gradually, and the jurisdiction of the Act was expanded through a series of amendments beginning in 1970. An important change was made in 1972, when Congress passed an amendment that discrimination could be determined by "effect" rather than by trying to prove "intent". Thus, if county or local practices resulted in a significant minority population being unable to elect candidates of their choice, the practices were considered to be discriminatory in effect.

In 1960, there were a total of 53,336 black voters registered in the state of Alabama; three decades later, there were 537,285,<ref>[http://www.alabamamoments.state.al.us/sec59det.html Selma-to-Montgomery 1965 Voting Rights March] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316162216/http://www.alabamamoments.state.al.us/sec59det.html |date=March 16, 2009 }} – Alabama Department of Archives & History.</ref> a tenfold increase. <!--Add officeholders - local and other offices -->

==Legacy and honors==
*In 1996, the 54-mile [[Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail]] was designated and is preserved by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/semo/historyculture/index.htm "History and Culture: Selma-to-Montgomery National Historic Trail], National Park Service.</ref> As part of the National Historic Trail, the National Park Service operates two interpretive centers (Selma and Lowndes County).

===Commemorative marches===
Since 1965, many marches have commemorated the events of Bloody Sunday, usually held on or around the anniversary of the original event, and currently known as the Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.al.com/news/2018/12/alabamas-iconic-civil-rights-town-now-the-fastest-shrinking-city-in-the-state.html|title=Alabama's iconic civil rights town now the fastest shrinking city in the state|last=Garrison|first=Greg|date=2018-12-16|website=al.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> In March 1975, [[Coretta Scott King]], the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., led four thousand marchers commemorating Bloody Sunday.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christian Herald|last1=Klopsch|first1=Louis|last2=Talmage|first2=Thomas De Witt|last3=Sandison|first3=George Henry|date=1975|publisher=Christian Herald}}</ref> On its 30th anniversary, Rep. [[John Lewis]], former president of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and a prominent activist during the Selma to Montgomery marches, said, "It's gratifying to come back and see the changes that have occurred; to see the number of registered voters and the number of Black elected officials in the state of Alabama to be able to walk with other members of Congress that are African Americans."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bTkDAAAAMBAJ&q=%22edmund+pettus+bridge%22&pg=PA22|title=Jet - Google Books|date=1995-03-27|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>

On the 40th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, over 10,000 people, including Lewis, again marched across Edmund Pettus Bridge.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrUDAAAAMBAJ&q=%22edmund+pettus+bridge%22&pg=PA6|title=Jet - Google Books|date=2005-03-28|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> Also, in 1996, the Olympic torch made its way across the bridge with its carrier, [[Andrew Young]], along with many public officials, to symbolize how far the South has come. When Young spoke at the [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church]] as part of the torch ceremony, he said, "We couldn't have gone to Atlanta with the Olympic Games if we hadn't come through Selma a long time ago."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/21819607.html?dids=21819607:21819607&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+01%2C+1996&author=Thomas+Heath&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=After+Three+Decades%2C+Selma+Sees+the+Light%3B+Torch+Crosses+Bridge+Between+Peace%2C+Violence&pqatl=google|title=After Three Decades, Selma Sees the Light; Torch Crosses Bridge Between Peace, Violence|last=Heath|first=Thomas|date=1996-07-01|accessdate=2010-08-22|publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com}}</ref>

In March 2015, on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], the first African-American U.S. president, delivered [[Barack Obama Selma 50th anniversary speech|a speech at the foot of the bridge]] and then, along with other U.S. political figures such as former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] and Representative John Lewis and Civil Rights Movement activists such as [[Amelia Boynton Robinson]] (at Obama's side in a wheelchair), led a march across the bridge. An estimated 40,000 people attended to commemorate the 1965 march, and to reflect on and speak about its impact on history and continuing efforts to address and improve U.S. civil rights.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/us/obama-in-selma-for-edmund-pettus-bridge-attack-anniversary.html|title=Obama, at Selma Memorial, Says, 'We Know the March Is Not Yet Over'|last1=Baker|first1=Peter|date=March 7, 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=10 March 2015|last2=Fausset|first2=Richard|issue=March 7, 2015}}</ref>

===Revitalization===
Montgomery was one of four state capitals chosen for a Greening Americas Capitals Grant, a project of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Beginning in 2011, EPA and community groups developed the study through consultations and a 3-day design workshops, aided by nationally acclaimed urban planners.<ref name="green">[http://www.epa.gov/dced/pdf/gac/montgomery_gac_final.pdf "Greening the Selma to Montgomery Trail: Reconnecting and Remembering"], ''Greening American Capitals'', EPA.</ref>
The Montgomery portion of the Selma to Montgomery trail was being improved through a multimillion-dollar investment in order to enhance the trail and related neighborhoods. The city chose a section that passes through a "historically significant African-American neighborhood".<ref name="green"/> Projects planned to improve design and sustainability include infill development, resurfacing, pedestrian improvements, environmental improvements including new trees and green-screens, and drainage improvements. In addition, many information panels have been installed, as well as several permanent public art displays that are tied to the march.<ref name="green"/>
 
The work in Montgomery is related to a larger multi-agency effort since 2009 between the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), EPA and the National Park Service to improve areas along the National Historic Voting Rights Trail to enable local communities to thrive. The US 80 corridor has been described in an EPA summary as a "54-mile corridor of high unemployment, health issues, lower educational and economic achievements, and severe rural isolation".<ref name="epacomm"/> Among the serious environmental issues identified by EPA has been the presence of active and abandoned gas stations along the highway, with potential contamination from petroleum leaks from underground storage sites. A site in Montgomery had been identified as a problem, and EPA conducted additional assessments since the beginning of the project. Cleanup of the Montgomery site was scheduled to be completed in 2011. In addition, the agencies have sponsored community engagement to develop plans related to community goals. Since 2010, federal teams have met with community leaders in Selma, Hayneville and Montgomery, the county seats of Dallas, Lowndes and Montgomery counties.<ref name="epacomm">[http://www.epa.gov/oust/communityengagement/ce_story_al_final_9-7-10.pdf "Community Engagement At Leaking Underground Storage Tank Sites: National Historic Voting Rights Trail Selma To Montgomery, Alabama"], EPA, 9 July 2010.
