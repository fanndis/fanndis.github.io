'''Jose Catral Mendoza''' (born August 13, 1947) is a former [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines]].

== Legal career ==
A [[political science]] graduate of the [[University of the Philippines]], Jose Mendoza took up his [[law school|law studies]] in the [[San Beda College of Law]] where he led the establishment of [[Lex Talionis Fraternitas]]. After passing the 1971 [[Philippine Bar Examination|Bar Examinations]], the young lawyer engaged in private practice and served as legal counsel of private corporations such as the Philippine Banking Corporation, the [[Meralco|Manila Electric Co.]], and the Gokongwei Group of Companies. He also became a senior consular investigator for the [[Embassy of the United States in Manila|United States Embassy]] before entering government service as a senior research attorney in the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] in 1977.

From 1980 to 1985, he worked as an associate in the Alampay Alvero Alampay Law Office before rejoining the Judiciary in 1985 as a confidential attorney in the Supreme Court, serving under Justices Nestor Alampay and [[Abdulwahid Bidin]].

== Career in the judiciary ==
Mendoza became a member of the [[Bench (law)|Bench]] in 1989 when he was appointed presiding [[judge]] of the Regional Trial Court of [[Sta. Cruz, Laguna]]. He eventually became the executive judge of the same court in 1992. In 1994, he was designated presiding judge, and later on as executive judge, of the [[Quezon City]] Regional Trial Court. After 15 years as a judge, he was appointed Associate Justice of the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] on July 4, 2003.

One of his well-known decisions as an appellate justice was the reinstatement of the criminal charges against millionaire businessman Dante Tan, an ally of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Joseph Estrada]] who was involved in a [[Market manipulation|stock price manipulation]] scandal. He also penned the decision approving the petitions for the [[writ of amparo]] and the writ of [[habeas corpus]] filed by the families of [[University of the Philippines]] students Sherlyn Cadapan and Karen Empeño, who were allegedly abducted by the members of the military in 2006.

On January 4, 2010, he was appointed [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] of the Supreme Court to replace erstwhile Associate Justice [[Minita Chico-Nazario]].

His first major decision as a member of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] was the controversial [http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2010/december2010/192935.htm ''Biraogo vs. Truth Commission''], where he struck down as unconstitutional [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s Executive Order No. 1 creating a [[Truth Commission#Philippines|Truth Commission]] to investigate corruption during the administration of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. Together with nine of the 15-member tribunal, he invalidated the executive order because of its apparent transgression of the [[equal protection clause]] for singling out the Arroyo administration. In his [[majority opinion|ponencia]], Mendoza blatantly tagged Aquino's Truth Commission "as a vehicle for vindictiveness and selective retribution."

Justice Mendoza also wrote the high tribunal's decision in [http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/pdf/web/viewer.html?file=/jurisprudence/2014/april2014/204819.pdf ''Imbong vs. Ochoa''] striking down as unconstitutional eight major provisions of the highly divisive [[Reproductive Health Law]] (RH Law), which was strongly opposed by [[Christian right|religious conservatives]] in the country. Mendoza nonetheless upheld the validity of the remaining provisions of the RH Law despite his strong affiliation with the influential [[Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic Church]]. In his ponencia, the magistrate highlighted the constitutional principle of [[separation of church and state]], stressing that "the church cannot impose its beliefs and convictions on the State and the rest of the citizenry. It cannot demand that the nation follow its beliefs, even if it sincerely believes that they are good for the country."
