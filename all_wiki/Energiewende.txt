== The term ''Energiewende'' ==

The Institute for Applied Ecology was funded by both environmental and religious organizations, and the importance of religious and conservative figures like Wolf von Fabeck and Peter Ahmels was crucial.  In the following decades, the term ''Energiewende'' expanded in scope – in its present form it dates back to at least 2002.

''Energiewende'' designated a significant change in [[energy policy]]. The term encompassed a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation (for example, producing heat and power in small cogeneration units), which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency.

In a broader sense, this transition also entailed a [[democratization]] of energy.<ref name="paulitz">

Public wind farms and solar parks can involve many citizens directly in energy production.<ref name="dnr-2011">{{cite web

 }}</ref> Photovoltaic systems can even be set up by individuals. Municipal utilities can also benefit citizens financially, while the conventional energy industry profits a relatively small number of shareholders. Also significant, the decentralized structure of renewable energies enables creation of value locally and minimizes capital outflows from a region. Renewable energy sources therefore play an increasingly important role in municipal energy policy, and local governments often promote them.

The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power.

Nuclear power plants were closed, and the existing nine plants were scheduled to close earlier than planned, in 2022.

One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market. It is believed 8,300&nbsp;km of power lines must be built or upgraded.<ref name="economist-2012" />  In 2010 legislation has been passed seeking construction and upgrade of 7'700 km of new grid lines, but only 950 km have been built by 2019 — and in 2017 only 30 km has been built.<ref name=":5" />

The different [[States of Germany|German States]] have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ''Energiewende'' have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills. Germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity [[price]]s (including taxes) in Europe.<ref>

Most of the computer scenarios used to analyse the ''Energiewende'' rely on a substantial carbon price to drive the transition to low-carbon technologies.

Coal-fired generation needs to be retired as part of the ''Energiewende''.  Some argue for an explicit negotiated phase-out of coal plants, along the lines of the well-publicized nuclear phase-out,<ref name="agora-2016a">

An official federal government report on progress under the ''Energiewende'', updated for 2014, notes that:<ref name="bmwi-2015-b" />

* energy consumption fell by 4.7% in 2014 (from 2013) and at {{val|13132}}{{nbsp}}petajoules reached it lowest level since 1990
* renewable generation is the number-one source of electricity

The goal to cut emissions by 40% by 2020 "will most likely be missed{{nbsp}}... if no further measures are taken" and the 55–60% share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption by 2035 is "unachievable" with the current plans for renewables expansion.<ref name="clew-2016a">

The fifth monitoring report on the ''Energiewende'' for 2015 was published in December 2016.  The expert commission which wrote the report warns that Germany will probably miss its 2020 climate targets and believes that this could threaten the credibility of the entire endeavor.  The commission puts forward a number of measures to address the slowdown, including a flat national {{CO2}} price imposed across all sectors, a greater focus on transport, and full market exposure for renewable generation.  Regarding the carbon price, the commission thinks that a reformed [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU{{nbsp}}ETS]] would be better, but that achieving agreement across Europe is unlikely.<ref name="egenter-and-wehrmann-2016">{{cite news | first1 = Sven | last1 = Egenter | first2 = Benjamin | last2 = Wehrmann | title = Experts call for {{CO2}} price to retain Energiewende's credibility | date = 15 December 2016 | work = Clean Energy Wire (CLEW) | location = Berlin, German | url = https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/experts-call-co2-price-retain-energiewendes-credibility | access-date = 2016-12-15}}</ref><ref name="bmwi-2016b">{{cite book | title = Die Energie der Zukunft: Fünfter Monitoring-Bericht zur Energiewende: Berichtsjahr 2015 | trans-title = The energy of the future: Fifth monitoring report for the ''Energiewende'': Report year 2015 | language = German

Also 50% increase of electricity prices was observed (compared to base 2007 prices). Germany's energy sector remains the largest single source of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, contributing over 40%.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Mission-oriented R&I policies: In-depth case studies: Energiewende|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/mission_oriented_r_and_i_policies_case_study_report_energiewende-de.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>   

In March 2019, Chancellor Merkel formed a so-called climate cabinet to find a consensus on new emissions reduction measures to meet 2030 targets. The result was the Climate Action Program'me 2030, which Berlin adopted on 9 October 2019.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/reports/germany-2020|title=Germany 2020 – Analysis|website=IEA|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> The Programme contains plans for a carbon pricing system for the heating and transportation sectors, which are not covered by the EU ETS.

== Computer studies ==

Much of the policy development for the ''Energiewende'' is underpinned by [[computer simulation|computer models]], run mostly by universities and research institutes.  The models are usually based on [[scenario analysis]] and are used to investigate different assumptions regarding the stability, sustainability, cost, efficiency, and public acceptability of various sets of technologies.

</ref>  The [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) REMix high-resolution energy model was used for the analysis.  A range of scenarios were investigated and a cost-competitive transition with good security of supply is possible.

The authors presume that the transmission network will continue to be reinforced and that cooperation with Norway and Sweden would allow their hydro generation to be used for storage.  The transition does not require Germany's [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|nuclear phase-out]] (''{{lang|de|Atomausstieg}}'') to be extended nor the construction of coal-fired plants with [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  Conventional generation assets need not be stranded and an orderly transition should prevail.  Stringent energy efficiency and energy saving programs can bring down the future costs of electricity.

=== 2015 Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project study ===

The [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]] (DDPP) aims to demonstrate how countries can transform their energy systems by 2050 in order to achieve a [[low-carbon economy]].
The 2015 German country report, produced in association with the [[Wuppertal Institute]], examines the official target of reducing domestic GHG emissions by 80% to 95% by 2050 (compared with 1990).<ref name="hillebrandt-2015">

</ref>  Decarbonization  pathways  for  Germany  are  illustrated  by  means  of  three  ambitious scenarios with energy-related emission reductions between 1990 and 2050 varying between 80%  and  more  than  90%.  Three strategies strongly contribute to GHG emission reduction: 
* energy efficiency improvements (in all sectors but especially in buildings)
* increased use of domestic renewables (with a focus on electricity generation)
* electrification  and  (in  two  of  the  scenarios  also)  use  of  renewable  electricity-based synthetic fuels (especially in the transport and industry sector)
In addition, some scenarios use controversially:
* final energy demand reductions through behavioral changes ([[mode of transport|modal shift]] in transport, changes in eating and heating habits)
* net imports of electricity from renewable sources or of [[bioenergy]]
* use of [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technology to reduce industry sector GHG emissions (including cement production)
Potential co-benefits for Germany include increased energy security, higher competitiveness of and global business opportunities for companies, job creation, stronger GDP growth, smaller energy bills for households, and less air pollution.

</ref>  The guiding question of the study is: how can a cost-optimised transformation of the German energy system — with consideration of all [[energy carrier]]s and consumer sectors — be achieved while meeting the declared [[climate protection]] targets and ensuring a secure energy supply at all times.  [[Carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) is explicitly excluded from the scenarios.  A future energy scenario emitting 85% less CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than 1990 levels is compared with a reference scenario, which assumes that the German energy system operates in 2050 the same way as it does today.  Under this comparison, primary energy supply drops 42%.  The total cumulative costs depend on the future prices for carbon and oil.  If the penalty for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increases to €100/tonne by 2030 and thereafter remains constant and fossil fuel prices increase annually by 2%, then the total cumulative costs of today's energy system are 8% higher than the costs required for the minus 85% scenario up to 2050.  The report also notes:

{{quote|From the macroeconomic perspective, the transformation of Germany's energy system demands a significant shift in cash flow, moving the cash spent on energy imports today to spend it instead on new investments in systems, their operation and maintenance.  In this respect a transformed energy system requires a large expenditure for local added value, a factor which also does not appear in the shown cost analysis.<ref name="henning-and-palzer-2015"/>{{rp|8}}}}

=== 2015 DIW study ===

A 2015 study uses DIETER or Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables, developed by the [[German Institute for Economic Research]] (DIW), Berlin, Germany.  The study examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60% to 100%.  Under the baseline scenario of 80% (the German government target for 2050), [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost.  Nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves.  Storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables, but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options, particularly on biomass availability.  The model is fully described in the study report.<ref name="zerrahn-and-schill-2015">

</ref>  Set in 2050, several scenarios use [[gas turbine#industrial gas turbines for power generation|gas power plants]] to stabilise the backbone of energy system, ensuring supply security during several weeks of low wind and solar radiation.  Other scenarios investigate a 100% renewable system and show these to be possible but more costly.  Flexible consumption and storage control ([[energy demand management|demand-side management]]) in households and the industrial sector is the most cost-efficient means of balancing short-term power fluctuations.  Long-term storage systems, based on [[power-to-X]], are only viable if carbon emissions are to be reduced by more than 80%.  On the question of costs, the study notes:

{{quote|Assuming that the price of emissions allowances in 2050 will significantly surpass its current level, a power generation system boasting a high percentage of wind and photovoltaics will, as a rule, come  cheaper  than  a  system  dominated by fossil fuel power plants.<ref name="acatech-2016"/>{{rp|7}}}}

</ref>  In the case of Germany, total end-use energy drops from 375.8&nbsp;GW for business-as-usual to 260.9&nbsp;GW under a fully renewable transition.  Load shares in 2050 would be: on-shore wind 35%, off-shore wind 17%, wave 0.08%, geothermal 0.01%, hydro-electric 0.87%, tidal 0%, residential PV 6.75%, commercial PV 6.48%, utility PV 33.8%, and [[concentrating solar power]] 0%.  The study also assess avoided air pollution, eliminated global climate change costs, and net job creation.  These co-benefits are substantial.
