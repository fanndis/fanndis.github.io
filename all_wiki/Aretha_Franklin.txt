'''Aretha Louise Franklin''' (March 25, 1942{{snd}}August 16, 2018) was an American singer, songwriter, actress, pianist, and civil rights activist.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/arts/music/aretha-franklin-dead-best-songs.html |title = Aretha Franklin's 20 Essential Songs |work = The New York Times |last = Farber|first= Jim |date = August 16, 2018 |access-date = August 21, 2018 }}</ref><!--NOTE: only include occupation(s) that reliable sources consider notable/integral to artist's career; no [[WP:Original research]]--> Franklin began her career as a child singing [[Gospel music|gospel]] at [[New Bethel Baptist Church (Detroit, Michigan)|New Bethel Baptist Church]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]], where her father [[C. L. Franklin]] was a minister. At the age of 18, she embarked on a secular-music career as a recording artist for [[Columbia Records]]. While Franklin's career did not immediately flourish, she found acclaim and commercial success after signing with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1966.  Hit songs such as "[[I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)]]", "[[Respect (song)#Aretha Franklin version 2|Respect]]", "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]", "[[Chain of Fools]]", "[[Think (Aretha Franklin song)|Think]]", and "[[I Say a Little Prayer]]" propelled her past her musical peers. By the end of the 1960s, Aretha Franklin had come to be known as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Soul]]".
 
Franklin continued to record acclaimed albums such as ''[[I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You]]'' (1967), ''[[Lady Soul]]'' (1968), ''[[Spirit in the Dark]]'' (1970), ''[[Young, Gifted and Black]]'' (1972), ''[[Amazing Grace (Aretha Franklin album)|Amazing Grace]]'' (1972), and ''[[Sparkle (soundtrack)|Sparkle]]'' (1976) before experiencing problems with her record company.

Aretha Louise Franklin was born on March 25, 1942, to [[Barbara Siggers Franklin|Barbara (nÃ©e Siggers)]] and [[C. L. Franklin|Clarence LaVaughn "C. L." Franklin]]. She was delivered at her family's home located at 406 Lucy Avenue, [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Her father was a [[Baptist minister]] and [[circuit preacher]] originally from [[Shelby, Mississippi]], while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist.{{sfn|Bego|2010|p=11}} Both Mr. and Mrs. Franklin had children from prior relationships in addition to the four children they had together. When Aretha was two, the family relocated to [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Aretha Franklin Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=  https://www.achievement.org/achiever/aretha-franklin/#interview|date=October 27, 2012}}</ref> By the time Aretha turned five, C. L. Franklin had permanently relocated the family to [[Detroit]], where he took over the pastorship of the [[New Bethel Baptist Church (Detroit, Michigan)|New Bethel Baptist Church]].{{Sfn|Ritz|2014|p=23}}

The Franklins had a troubled marriage due to Mr. Franklin's infidelities, and they separated in 1948.{{Sfn|Ritz|2014|pp=23â€“24}} At that time, Barbara Franklin returned to Buffalo with Aretha's half brother, Vaughn.{{sfn|Ritz|2014|p=24}} After the separation, Aretha recalled seeing her mother in Buffalo during the summer, and Barbara Franklin frequently visited her children in Detroit.{{sfn|McAvoy|2002|pp=19â€“20}}{{Sfn|Ritz|2014|p=24}} Aretha's mother died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on March 7, 1952, before Aretha's tenth birthday.{{Sfn|Warner|2014|p=7}} Several women, including Aretha's grandmother, Rachel, and [[Mahalia Jackson]], took turns helping with the children at the Franklin home.{{sfn|McAvoy|2002|p=22}} During this time, Aretha learned how to play piano by ear.{{sfn|McAvoy|2002|pp=20â€“21}} She also attended public school in Detroit, going through her freshman year at [[Northern High School (Detroit, Michigan)|Northern High School]], but dropping out during her sophomore year.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://historicdetroit.org/building/northern-high-school/ |title = Northern High School |publisher = historicdetroit.org }}</ref>

Aretha's father's emotionally driven sermons resulted in his being known as the man with the "million-dollar voice". He earned thousands of dollars for sermons in various churches across the country.{{sfn|Dobkin|2006|p=48}}{{sfn|Feiler|2009|p=248}} His celebrity status led to his home being visited by various celebrities. Among the visitors were gospel musicians [[Clara Ward]], [[James Cleveland]], and early [[The Caravans|Caravans]] members [[Albertina Walker]] and [[Inez Andrews]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Jackie Wilson]] and [[Sam Cooke]] all became friends of C. L.

==Music career==
===Beginnings (1952â€“1960)===
Just after her mother's death, Franklin began singing solos at New Bethel, debuting with the hymn "Jesus, Be a Fence Around Me".{{sfn|McAvoy|2002|p=22}}<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/5151565-421/roots--of-soul.html |title = Aretha Franklin's roots of soul |first = Dave |last = Hoekstra |date = May 12, 2011 |work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date = April 18, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120622045122/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/5151565-421/roots--of-soul.html |archive-date = June 22, 2012 |url-status=live |df = mdy-all }}</ref> When Franklin was 12, her father began [[career management|managing]] her; he would bring her on the road with him during his so-called "gospel caravan" tours for her to perform in various churches.{{Sfn|Ritz|2014|p=47}} He also helped her sign her first recording deal with [[Battle Records (record label)|J.V.B. Records]]. Recording equipment was installed inside New Bethel Baptist Church and nine tracks were recorded. Franklin was featured on vocals and piano.<ref>{{cite web |title = Pickwick Group Ltd â€“ Aretha Franklin â€“ Songs Of Faith |url = http://www.pickwickgroup.com/catalogue/details/717042 |website = www.pickwickgroup.com |access-date = August 22, 2018 |language = en }}</ref> In 1956, J.V.B. released Franklin's first single, "Never Grow Old", backed with "You Grow Closer". "Precious Lord <small>(Part One)</small>" backed with "Precious Lord <small>(Part Two)</small>" followed in 1959. These four tracks, with the addition of "There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood", were released on side one of the 1956 album, ''Spirituals''. This was reissued by Battle Records in 1962 under the same title.<ref>{{cite web |title = J.V.B./Battle Album Discography |url = http://www.bsnpubs.com/detroit/battle.html |website = www.bsnpubs.com |access-date = August 22, 2018 }}</ref> In 1965, [[Checker Records]] released ''[[Songs of Faith (Aretha Franklin album)|Songs of Faith]]'', featuring the five tracks from the 1956 ''Spirituals'' album, with the addition of four previously unreleased recordings.

During this time, Franklin would occasionally travel with [[The Soul Stirrers]].{{sfn|Warner|2014|pp=8â€“9}} As a young gospel singer, Franklin spent summers on the gospel circuit in Chicago and stayed with [[Mavis Staples]]' family.<ref name="Queen">{{Cite news |url = https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/08/16/aretha-franklin-dies-chicago-concerts/ |title = Aretha Franklin: Remembering Her Many Ties To Chicago; She Became 'Queen Of Soul' Here |date = August 16, 2018 |publisher = CBS Chicago |access-date = August 17, 2018 }}</ref>
According to music producer [[Quincy Jones]], while Franklin was still young, [[Dinah Washington]] let him know, "Aretha was the 'next one'".<ref>{{cite web |last = Leight |first = Elias |title = Quincy Jones on Aretha Franklin: 'You Will Reign as the Queen Forever' |date = August 16, 2018 |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/quincy-jones-on-aretha-franklin-you-will-reign-as-the-queen-forever-711687/ |work = Rolling Stone |language = en-US |access-date = August 19, 2018 }}</ref> In 1958, Franklin and her father traveled to [[California]], where she met singer Sam Cooke.{{Sfn|Ritz|2014|p=69}} At the age of 16, Franklin went on tour with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and she would ultimately sing at his funeral in 1968.<ref>{{cite news |first1 = Douglas |last1=Wolk |author2 = David Browne |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/aretha-franklin-queen-of-soul-dead-at-76-119453/ |title = Aretha Franklin, Queen of Soul, Dead at 76 |work = [[Rolling Stone]] |date = August 16, 2018 |access-date = August 16, 2018 |quote = At 16, she went on tour with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and later sang at his funeral. }}</ref>

After turning 18, Franklin confided to her father that she aspired to follow Sam Cooke in recording pop music, and moved to New York.{{Sfn|Bracks|2012|p=365}} Serving as her manager, C. L. Franklin agreed to the move and helped to produce a two-song demo that soon was brought to the attention of [[Columbia Records]], who agreed to sign her in 1960. Franklin was signed as a "five-percent artist".{{sfn|''Ebony''|1964|p=88}} During this period, Franklin would be coached by choreographer [[Cholly Atkins]] to prepare for her pop performances. Before signing with Columbia, Sam Cooke tried to persuade Franklin's father to sign her with his label, [[RCA Records|RCA]], but his request was denied. Record label owner [[Berry Gordy]] was also looking to sign Franklin and her elder sister [[Erma Franklin|Erma]] to his [[Motown Records|Tamla]] label. However, C.L. Franklin felt the label was not yet established enough, and he turned Gordy down. Franklin's first Columbia single, "[[Today I Sing the Blues]]",<ref name="pc52" /> was issued in September 1960 and later reached the top 10 of the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm & Blues Sellers]] chart.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.billboard.com/artist/279868/aretha+franklin/chart |title = Aretha Franklin â€“ chart history |website = Billboard |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160918104610/https://www.billboard.com/artist/279868/aretha+franklin/chart |archive-date = September 18, 2016 }}</ref>

===Columbia (1961â€“1966)===
In January 1961, Columbia issued Franklin's first secular album, ''[[Aretha: With The Ray Bryant Combo]]''. The album featured her first single to chart the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, "[[Won't Be Long (Aretha Franklin song)|Won't Be Long]]", which also peaked at number 7 on the R&B chart.{{Sfn|Ritz|2014|pp=86â€“87}} Mostly produced by [[Clyde Otis]], Franklin's Columbia recordings saw her performing in diverse genres such as [[standard (song)|standards]], [[vocal jazz]], [[blues]], [[doo-wop]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. Before the year was out, Franklin scored her first hit single with her rendition of the standard "[[Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBEEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Rock-a-Bye%22+%22aretha+franklin%22+chart&pg=PA22|title=Queen of Soul|magazine=Billboard|date=October 4, 2003|page=22}}</ref> "Rock-a-Bye" became her first international hit, reaching the top 40 in Australia and Canada.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} By the end of 1961, Franklin was named as a "new-star female vocalist" in ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine.{{sfn|''Ebony''|1964|p=85}} In 1962, Columbia issued two more albums, ''[[The Electrifying Aretha Franklin]]'' and ''[[The Tender, the Moving, the Swinging Aretha Franklin]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-electrifying-aretha-franklin-mw0001879047 |title = The Electrifying Aretha Franklin |website = AllMusic |access-date = August 16, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-tender-the-moving-the-swinging-aretha-franklin-mw0000849065 |title = The Tender, The Moving, The Swinging Aretha Franklin |website = AllMusic |access-date = August 16, 2018 }}</ref> the latter of which reached No.&nbsp;69 on the ''Billboard'' chart.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://clinton.presidentiallibraries.us/exhibits/show/rock/franklin |title = Aretha Franklin |publisher = Clinton Presidential Library |access-date = August 16, 2018 }}</ref>

In the 1960s, during a performance at the [[Regal Theater, Chicago|Regal Theater]], [[WVON]] radio personality [[Pervis Spann]] announced that Franklin should be crowned "the Queen of Soul".<ref name=wendy/><ref name="Queen" /> Spann ceremonially placed a crown on her head.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/how-aretha-franklin-became-queen-soul-n901336 |title = This is the moment Aretha Franklin became the 'Queen of Soul' |last = Clark |first = Dartunorro |date = August 16, 2018 |work = NBC News |access-date = August 21, 2018 |language = en-US }}</ref> By 1964, Franklin began recording more pop music, reaching the top 10 on the R&B chart with the ballad "Runnin' Out of Fools" in early 1965. She had two R&B charted singles in 1965 and 1966 with the songs "[[One Step Ahead (Aretha Franklin song)|One Step Ahead]]" and "Cry Like a Baby", while also reaching the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Easy Listening]] charts with the ballads "[[You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)|You Made Me Love You]]" and "(No, No) I'm Losing You". By the mid-1960s, Franklin was making $100,000 per year from countless performances in nightclubs and theaters.{{sfn|''Ebony''|1964|p=85}} Also during that period, she appeared on rock-and-roll shows such as ''[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]'' and ''[[Shindig!]]''. However, she struggled with commercial success while at Columbia. Label executive [[John H. Hammond]] later said he felt Columbia did not understand Franklin's early gospel background and failed to bring that aspect out further during her period there.<ref name="pc52">{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 â€“ The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Franklin's debut Atlantic album, ''[[I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You]]'', also became commercially successful, later going gold. Franklin scored two more top-ten singles in 1967, including "[[Baby I Love You (Aretha Franklin song)|Baby I Love You]]" and "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]". Her rapport with producer [[Jerry Wexler]] helped in the creation of the majority of Franklin's peak recordings with Atlantic. In 1968, she issued the top-selling albums ''[[Lady Soul]]'' and ''[[Aretha Now]]'', which included some of her most popular hit singles, including "[[Chain of Fools]]", "[[Ain't No Way]]", "[[Think (Aretha Franklin song)|Think]]" and "[[I Say a Little Prayer]]".

In 1969 Franklin was the subject of a criminal [[impersonator|impersonation]] scheme. Another woman performed at several Florida venues under the name Aretha Franklin. Suspicion was drawn when the fake Franklin charged only a fraction of the expected rate to perform. Franklin's lawyers contacted Florida authorities and uncovered a coercive scheme in which the singer, [[Vickie Jones]], had been threatened with violence and constrained into impersonating her idol, whom she resembled closely both in voice and looks.<ref name=NYT>{{cite journal |last1=Maysh |first1=Jeff |date=July 2018 |title=The Counterfeit Queen of Soul |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/counterfeit-queen-soul-180969340/ | journal=Smithsonian Magazine |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> After being cleared of wrongdoing, Jones subsequently enjoyed a brief career of her own, during which she was herself the subject of an impersonation.

Franklin's success expanded during the early 1970s, during which she recorded the multi-week R&B number one "[[Don't Play That Song (You Lied)]]", as well as the top-ten singles "[[Spanish Harlem (song)|Spanish Harlem]]", "[[Rock Steady (Aretha Franklin song)|Rock Steady]]" and "[[Day Dreaming (Aretha Franklin song)|Day Dreaming]]".

That same year, Franklin received global praise after her [[Grammy Awards of 1998|1998 Grammy Awards]] performance. She had initially been asked to come and perform in honor of the 1980 ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' film in which she appeared with [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]]. That evening after the show had already begun, [[Luciano Pavarotti]] himself contacted show producers and said he was too ill to perform the opera aria "[[Nessun dorma]]" as planned. The show's producers were desperate to fill the time slot, and approached Franklin with their dilemma. She was a friend of Pavarotti, and had sung the selection two nights prior at the annual [[MusiCares]] event. She asked to hear Pavarotti's rehearsal recording, and after listening, agreed that she could sing it in the [[tenor]] range that the orchestra was prepared to play in. Over one billion people worldwide saw the performance, and she received an immediate [[standing ovation]]. She would go on to record the selection, and perform it live several more times in the years to come; the last time being in [[Philadelphia]] for [[Pope Francis]] at the [[World Meeting of Families]] in September 2015. A small boy was so touched by her performance that he came onto the stage and embraced her while Franklin was still singing.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto1"/>

Her final Arista album, ''[[So Damn Happy (Aretha Franklin album)|So Damn Happy]]'', was released in 2003 and featured the Grammy-winning song "Wonderful".

==Music style and image==
[[File: Aretha Franklin, The Gospel Tradition In Performance at the White House, 2015.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Franklin waiting to perform at the White House, in 2015]]
According to [[Richie Unterberger]], Franklin was "one of the giants of soul music, and indeed of American pop as a whole. More than any other performer, she epitomized soul at its most gospel-charged".<ref name=" Unterberger" /> She had often been described as a great singer and musician due to "vocal flexibility, interpretive intelligence, skillful piano-playing, her ear, her experience".{{sfn|Dobkin|2006|p=8}} Franklin's voice was described as being a "powerful [[mezzo-soprano]] voice". She was praised for her arrangements and interpretations of other artists' hit songs.{{sfn|Whitaker|2011|p=312}} According to [[David Remnick]], what "distinguishes her is not merely the breadth of her catalog or the cataract force of her vocal instrument; it's her musical intelligence, her way of singing behind the beat, of spraying a wash of notes over a single word or syllable, of constructing, moment by moment, the emotional power of a three-minute song. 'Respect' is as precise an artifact as a Ming vase".<ref name=Remnick />  Describing Franklin's voice as that of a youngster on her first album, ''[[Songs of Faith (Aretha Franklin album)|Songs of Faith]]'', released in 1956 when she was just 14, Jerry Wexler explained that it "was not that of a child but rather of an ecstatic [[hierophant]]".{{sfn|McMahon|2000|p=373}} Critic Randy Lewis assessed her skills as a pianist as "magic" and "inspirational". Musicians and professionals alike such as Elton John, [[Keith Richards]], Carole King, and Clive Davis were fans of her piano performances.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-aretha-franklin-piano-20180816-story.html |title = The voice was incredible, but Aretha Franklin at the piano was also pure magic |last = Lewis |first = Randy |date = August 16, 2018 |work = Los Angeles Times |access-date = August 16, 2018 }}</ref>

In 2015, then-President [[Barack Obama]] wrote the following regarding Franklin:<blockquote>Nobody embodies more fully the connection between the African-American spiritual, the blues, R. & B., rock and roll â€” the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope. American history wells up when Aretha sings. That's why, when she sits down at a piano and sings 'A Natural Woman,' she can move me to tears â€” the same way that Ray Charles's version of 'America the Beautiful' will always be in my view the most patriotic piece of music ever performed â€” because it captures the fullness of the American experience, the view from the bottom as well as the top, the good and the bad, and the possibility of synthesis, reconciliation, transcendence.<ref name=Bort>Bort, Ryan (August 16, 2018), [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/aretha-franklin-barack-obama-710407/ "The Special Bond Between Aretha Franklin and Barack Obama"], ''Rolling Stone''.</ref></blockquote>

==Civil rights activism==
From her time growing up in the home of a prominent African-American preacher to the end of her life, Franklin was immersed and involved in the struggle for [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] and [[women's rights]]. She provided money for civil rights groups, at times covering payroll, and performed at benefits and protests.<ref name=Lang>{{Cite news |url = http://time.com/5369587/aretha-franklin-civil-rights/ |title = Aretha Franklin Had a Huge Impact on the Civil Rights Movement |last = Lang |first = Cady |date = August 16, 2018 |work = Time |access-date = August 21, 2018 }}</ref> When [[Angela Davis]] was jailed in 1970, Franklin told ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'': "Angela Davis must go free ...

I'm going to see her free if there is any justice in our courts, not because I believe in communism, but because she's a Black woman and she wants freedom for Black people".<ref name=Lang /> Her songs "Respect" and "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" became anthems of these movements for social change.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/arts/aretha-franklin-dead-civil-rights.html |title = Aretha Franklin, Civil Rights Stalwart: 'In Her Voice, We Could Feel Our History' |first = Sandra E.|last= Garcia |date = August 17, 2018 |work = The New York Times |access-date = August 21, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/08/aretha-franklin-history-with-civil-rights |title = Aretha Franklin's History with Civil Rights, from Martin Luther King Jr. to Barack Obama |last = Weaver |first = Hilary |date = August 16, 2018 |work = Vanity Fair |access-date = August 21, 2018 }}</ref> Franklin and several other American icons declined to take part in performing at President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 inauguration as a large-scale act of musical protest.<ref name="Blim2017">{{cite journal |last1=Blim |first1=Dan |title=Party Politics: Ideology and Musical Performance at Donald Trump's Inaugural Celebration |journal=American Music |date=2017 |volume=35 |issue=4 |page=487 |doi=10.5406/americanmusic.35.4.0478 |s2cid=158519302 |issn=0734-4392 |oclc=7788409108}}</ref>

==Personal life==
After being raised in Detroit, Franklin relocated in the 1960s to [[New York City]], where she lived until moving to [[Los Angeles]] in the mid-1970s. She eventually settled in [[Encino, Los Angeles]], where she lived until 1982. She then returned to the Detroit suburb of [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], to be close to her siblings and ailing father. Franklin maintained a residence there until her death. Following an incident in 1984, she cited a fear of flying that prevented her from traveling overseas; she performed only in North America afterward.<ref name=wendy>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXI72Wa65LU|title=Interview|publisher=The Wendy Williams Show|date=March 2011|time =2:00|access-date=August 16, 2011}}</ref>

Franklin's sisters, [[Erma Franklin|Erma]] and [[Carolyn Franklin|Carolyn]], were professional musicians and spent years performing background vocals on Franklin's recordings. Following Franklin's divorce from Ted White, her brother Cecil became her manager, and maintained that position until his death from lung cancer on December 26, 1989.

Franklin's half-brother Vaughn died in late 2002.<ref name="Salvatore" /> Her half-sister, Carol Kelley (nÃ©e Jennings; 1940-2019), is C. L.
