'''F. William McCalpin''' (8 November 1921 &ndash; 9 December 2009) was an American [[Lawyer|attorney]], who throughout his career was a strong advocate for legal services within the [[American Bar Association]].  He was involved in a variety of leadership positions supporting both the private bar and legal services.  He was named Chair twice of the national [[Legal Services Corporation]] and served on that organization's board of directors across four decades.  [[Hillary Clinton]], who served as Chair of the Legal Services Corporation between McCalpin's two terms as Chair, wrote of him, "He was an extraordinary man, a valued mentor and a true champion for equal justice and access to legal services for the poor. Through his work Bill changed lives and made an indelible impact upon the legal community."<ref name="Clinton">{{Cite web
