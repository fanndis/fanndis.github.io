"'''Stupid Love'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. It was officially released on February 28, 2020, as the lead single from Gaga's sixth studio album, ''[[Chromatica]]'' (2020), after it was leaked in January 2020. It was written by Gaga, [[BloodPop]], [[Tchami]], [[Max Martin]], and Ely Rise, with BloodPop explaining that it was the song that started his work on ''Chromatica'' with the singer. It is a [[disco]]-infused [[dance-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[House music|house]] song that talks about gathering the courage to fall in love again after a heartbreak.

The single's release was preceded by billboards with stills from the accompanying music video, and promotional photos posted on social media. The song garnered positive response from [[Music journalism|music critics]], and it was favorably compared to the singer's earlier works. Commercially, the song reached number one in [[Scotland]], [[Hungary]] and [[El Salvador]], as well as the top five of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the [[UK Singles Chart]], and achieved a top 10 placement on music charts in over 15 territories.

The music video for the song was directed by [[Daniel Askill]] and was released on the same day as the single. It takes place in the fictional world Chromatica, and shows Gaga leading the "Kindness Punks," and performing choreography with groups of dance warriors, each group with a corresponding color. The track was also featured in a [[lip sync]] video, promoting Gaga's [[Haus Laboratories]] eyeshadow palette named after "Stupid Love." Gaga performed "Stupid Love" as the final song of a ''Chromatica'' medley at the [[2020 MTV Video Music Awards]].

"Stupid Love" was written by Gaga with the help of [[BloodPop]], [[Tchami]], [[Max Martin]], and Ely Rise.<ref name="booklet">{{cite AV media notes |others=Lady Gaga |title=Chromatica |year=2020 |type=booklet |publisher=[[Interscope Records|Interscope]]}}</ref> According to BloodPop, he first played the instrumental of the song to Gaga at the Kansas City stop of her [[Joanne World Tour]] while they were working on songs for the [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to her movie, ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. While none of those songs made the soundtrack, working together on "Stupid Love" was fruitful and it convinced BloodPop into committing to co-produce the singer's whole album.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lady Gaga's 'Chromatica' team reveals the history and future of her new era |url=https://ew.com/music/lady-gaga-chromatica-behind-the-scenes/|access-date=June 12, 2020 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |language=EN |first=Joey |last=Nolfi|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200613100924/https://ew.com/music/lady-gaga-chromatica-behind-the-scenes/|archive-date=June 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="RSwelcome">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lady-gaga-chromatica-making-of-bloodpop-axwell-1007139/ |title=Welcome to 'Chromatica': Inside Lady Gaga's Triumphant Dance Floor Return |date=May 30, 2020 |accessdate=June 16, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Brittany |last=Spanos|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200617192833/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lady-gaga-chromatica-making-of-bloodpop-axwell-1007139/|archive-date=June 17, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

BloodPop felt that the demo of the song "was missing something," and he credits Max Martin with having "some fantastic ideas that really elevated it."<ref name="RSwelcome"/> The track marks the first time Gaga worked with Martin, who contributed to hit-songs with artists [[Katy Perry]], [[Britney Spears]] and [[Taylor Swift]]. Gaga admitted she was at first hesitant to work with Martin as she likes to write and produce on her own terms, but "decided to stop being an asshole" and meet him. She explained: "Basically, I sang over a track that BloodPop made. We sent over what I sang to Max, Max picked some parts out, sent it back to me, and then I wrote lyrics. I warmed up my voice, got in the booth, I sang it, and what you're hearing on 'Stupid Love' is what we did that day."<ref name="Beats1Feb">{{cite web |url=https://music.apple.com/us/post/sa.e8ad7cc0-59c3-11ea-b990-4d970530bffb |title=Lady Gaga on "Stupid Love" |date=February 27, 2020 |accessdate=February 28, 2020 |website=New Music Daily with Zane Lowe |publisher=Apple Inc.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229041344/https://music.apple.com/us/post/sa.e8ad7cc0-59c3-11ea-b990-4d970530bffb|archive-date=February 29, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Describing Gaga's wishes, Tanno explains, "she wanted to exude a 'Kindness Punk', someone who fights for kindness and leads with love.”<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/makeup/a31137257/lady-gaga-stupid-love-music-video-makeup-sarah-tanno/ |title=Lady Gaga's Makeup Artist Spills The Details on Her "Stupid Love" Music Video Beauty Look |last=Rosenstein |first=Jenna |date=February 28, 2020 |website=Harper's BAZAAR |language=en-US|access-date=February 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229095039/https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/makeup/a31137257/lady-gaga-stupid-love-music-video-makeup-sarah-tanno/|archive-date=February 29, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Tanno sought inspiration from a prior era in Gaga's career in creating Gaga's face pieces for the music video. "In the ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' era she had these cheek prosthetics—so I thought, what is the new special thing that I can make for her? This armor naturally will come in different shades of metallic pink,"<ref name=":2" /> explained Tanno. Wanting the pieces to move with Gaga as she moved and danced, Tanno crafted the face pieces out of materials resembling bone prosthetics instead of opting for metal.<ref name=":2" /> Unlike the face pieces, Gaga's costumes featured pieces crafted of actual metal designed by Laurel DeWitt. "The mood boards were a crazy mash of futuristic armor, aliens, and even an insect type vibe. Everything had to be pink so I worked with her style team and just did my interpretation on it. Pink metal! I mean c'mon! It was perfect,"<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/02/28/lady-gaga-stupid-love-costume-designer-interview-laurel-dewitt/ |title=Lady Gaga's 'Stupid Love' Costume Designer Reveals How Involved Singer Was In Music Video Looks |last=Brody |first=Beth Shilliday,Lanae |date=February 28, 2020 |website=Hollywood Life |language=en|access-date=February 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229134034/https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/02/28/lady-gaga-stupid-love-costume-designer-interview-laurel-dewitt/|archive-date=February 29, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>  DeWitt described. The four different outfits crafted for Gaga by DeWitt and Gaga's pink wig were seen as a departure from Gaga's previous style. DeWitt added that Gaga loved the styles, but she found some to be painful to wear, concluding, "you know Gaga, anything for fashion."<ref name=":0" />

===Synopsis and reception===
[[File:Lady Gaga - Stupid Love (music video screenshot).png|thumb|Gaga, surrounded by her dancers, performing in pink face armor and headpiece in the music video.

Gaga and her squad are running to the scene of a battle. The singer is seen in various hot pink outfits dancing it out with groups of dance warriors. Once the factions begin to fight again, Gaga cannot take it anymore. She levitates two fighters and slams them back to the ground. With that move, the battle is won. Gaga leads the dance warriors into one big celebration to conclude the video. The faction in pink, led by Gaga, restored peace to the desert region.
