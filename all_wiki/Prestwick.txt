== History ==
[[File:Prestwick Town Hall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Prestwick Freeman's Hall]]

Prestwick's name comes from the [[Old English]] for, ''priest's farm'': ''preost'' meaning "priest" and ''wic'' meaning "farm". The town was originally an outlying farm of a [[religious]] house.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prestwick South Community Council|url=http://www.prestwicksouthcommunitycouncil.org/history.html|website=Prestwick South Community Council History|accessdate=15 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122044101/http://prestwicksouthcommunitycouncil.org/history.html|archivedate=22 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Vision of Britain through time|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/17383|website=Prestwick, Ayrshire|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Old English Translator|url=http://www.oldenglishtranslator.co.uk/index.htm|website=Old English Translator|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref> [[George T. Flom]] suggested that the name was of [[Old Norse]] origin.<ref>[[George T. Flom]], 1900, ''Scandinavian Influence On Southern Lowland Scotch'', p. 3</ref> In this case, it would mean "priest's bay".

From [[Robert the Bruce]] to [[James VI of Scotland|James VI, King of Scots]], numerous Kings have traversed the coastal walks in and around Prestwick and [[Troon]]. Bruce is reputed to have been cured of [[leprosy]] by the waters of the well at [[St Ninians]] church. The well still exists behind the church.

Although it has been a Burgh of Barony for over a thousand years, it was a village until the railway arrived in the 1840s and the middle class from Glasgow started to build large houses along the coast.

The Prestwick Bathing Lake, known as the Lido, was opened in 1931 by the Secretary of State for Scotland, William Adamson. It was the largest swimming pool north of the border. It could accommodate 1200 bathers and 3000 spectators. It hosted swimming galas, diving exhibitions, moonlight swimming sessions and regular fireworks displays and was the venue of some of the Miss Scotland competitions. It was closed in 1972 and subsequently demolished.

On 28 August 1944, a [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] (42-72171) of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], on approach into Glasgow Prestwick Airport in bad weather, crashed into a residential area of Prestwick, killing all 20 passengers and crew and five people on the ground.<ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19440828-2 Aviation Safety Network 19440828-2]</ref>

== Transport ==
[[Glasgow Prestwick Airport]], formerly Prestwick International Airport, opened in the 1930s. The airport was a transatlantic gateway for over half a century. It lies close to, and was the last European re-fuelling way-point on, the [[Great Circle]] route from London via [[Thule, Greenland|Thule]] in [[Greenland]] to [[San Francisco]] - now no longer relevant for modern aircraft with non-stop range. During [[World War II]] the [[US Air Force]] had a base at the airport, and [[Elvis Presley]] set foot in the UK for the only time there on 3 March 1960, when his [[US Army]] transport aircraft stopped for refuelling en route from Germany.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/161106-elvis-presleys-visit-to-prestwick-in-1960/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316081902/http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/161106-elvis-presleys-visit-to-prestwick-in-1960/ |archive-date=16 March 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8547200.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blue suede shoes and bobby socks | date=2010-03-03}}</ref> Though a period of decline in the 1980s and 1990s saw it lose its status as Scotland's primary transatlantic airport, Prestwick continues to handle US military flights. In July 2005, the airport was the main transport hub for world leaders attending the [[G8]] conference in [[Gleneagles, Scotland|Gleneagles]].

The airport now caters to one [[low-cost carrier|low-cost airline]], [[Ryanair]]. In addition, [[BAE Systems]], [[Goodrich Corporation]], [[Spirit AeroSystems]] and [[GE Aircraft Engines]] have maintenance/manufacturing facilities adjacent to the airfield. Ryanair also has maintenance facilities at Prestwick.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Prestwick has a [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy Air Station]], also known as [[HMS Gannet SAR Flight|HMS Gannet]], where [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] search and rescue helicopters are stationed. Prestwick is a major [[air traffic control]] centre, with both the Scottish Air Traffic Control Centre (controlling 70% of UK airspace) and Prestwick Oceanic Area Control Centre ([[Shanwick Oceanic Control]] - responsible for air traffic over the eastern half of the North Atlantic) located at the [[National Air Traffic Services|NATS]] owned 'Scottish and Oceanic Area Control Centre'.

Prestwick is on the [[Ayrshire Coast Line]] between [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]] and Ayr. Three trains per hour call at both {{Stnlnk|Prestwick Town}} and {{Stnlnk|Prestwick International Airport}}, with additional services at peak times. Glasgow is approximately 50 minutes from Prestwick by rail. The line continues south to the port of [[Stranraer]] on the [[Wigtownshire]] coast, but a change of trains at Ayr is usually required.

The bus routes that run through Prestwick are usually run by Stagecoach Western including an express service to and from Glasgow known as the "X77".

The [[A79 road]] runs directly through the town, and is normally reached from the [[A77 road|A77]] trunk road between Glasgow and Stranraer, or from the [[A78 road|A78]] Ayrshire coastal route to [[Largs]] and [[Greenock]].

The remains of the old parish church are located near Prestwick railway station. Thought to have originally been built in the 12th century, the small church building is now a ruin, and is surrounded by an ancient graveyard.<ref>{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=SM5883|desc=Prestwick, Old Parish Church|access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref> [[Andrew Strath]], "Keeper of the Green" at [[Prestwick Golf Club]] in the 1860s, is buried in the cemetery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Prestwick has a {{convert|1|mi|adj=on}} long [[esplanade]] alongside Prestwick Bay, part of the [[Firth of Clyde]]. It has two children's playgrounds. At the north end Kid'zplay, an indoor activity centre, can be found next to the large play-area that was formerly a large open air swimming pool. Parallel to the esplanade is a line of large houses overlooking Arran.

The Prestwick Old Course hosted the first [[The Open Championship|Open Golf Championship]] in 1860. The first twelve Open Championships were played there, from 1860 to 1872. (the Championship was not played in 1871).<ref name="open" /><ref name="golftoday" /> The town also hosts two other golf courses, St. Nicholas and St. Cuthberts. St. Nicholas is a traditional links course south of the town.

Prestwick St Ninians Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1912. The club continued until the 1950s.<ref>[http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=258 "Prestwick Golf Clubs"], "Golf’s Missing Links".</ref>

The [[Shaw Monument]] stands on the high ground overlooking Prestwick Airport.

On Ardayre Road in Prestwick is a Polish memorial. Its origins can be traced to a memorial erected by the Polish Air Force at [[Monkton, Ayrshire|Monkton]]. Discovered there in a dilapidated and vandalised condition, it was moved by Kyle and Carrick District Council in 1986 to its present site in the gardens of the RAFA Club which overlooks the sea. The memorial was repaired and placed on a new plinth. On 2 May 1987 the memorial was unveiled with a commemorative plaque by the Polish Naval, Air Force and Ex-Combattants' Associations. On the 45th anniversary of the sinking of the [[ORP Orkan (G90)]], 8 October 1988, another commemorative plaque was installed in memory of the Polish Navy, Merchant Navy and Coastal Command airmen who died in the Battle of the Atlantic. On Polish Navy Day (10 February) at the memorial, in a service that both Polish and Scottish ex-servicemen participate in, the memories of those that perished are remembered in a spirit of friendship and comradeship between Polish and Scottish ex-servicemen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Polish Navy Memorial at Prestwick|url=http://www.ostrycharz.free-online.co.uk/PolonicaPrestwick.html|publisher=ostrycharz.free-online.co.uk|accessdate=11 June 2012}}</ref>

[[The Oval (Prestwick)|The Oval]] is a public park in the centre of Prestwick with two full size football pitches with indoor changing rooms, a tennis centre with three indoor courts and eight outdoor, a 25m indoor swimming pool and gym, indoor bowling green and cricket club. The park was gifted to the town in 1954.
