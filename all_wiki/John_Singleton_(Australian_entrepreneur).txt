'''John Desmond Singleton''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (born 9 November 1941) is an Australian entrepreneur. He built his success and wealth in the advertising business in Australia in the 1970s and 1980s. He now has diverse investment interests in radio broadcasting, publishing and thoroughbred breeding and racing.

In 2019, Singleton sold his 32.2% stake in [[Macquarie Media]] for {{AUD}}80&nbsp;million, which [[Nine Entertainment Co.|Nine Entertainment]] purchased for $1.46 per share.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=TAWEB_WRE170_a&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2F80m-deal-singleton-sells-out-of-radio-after-60year-career%2Fnews-story%2Ffcbe0774463f850e4df86b59a3d64899&memtype=anonymous&mode=premium&nk=453c7c78975764d076197d5936aae7f6-1569163796|title=Singo sells out of radio |website=[[The Australian]] |date=23 September 2019 |access-date=2019-09-22 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

==Early life==
Singleton was born in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Enfield, New South Wales|Enfield]] and educated at [[Fort Street High School]].

==Advertising career==
He commenced a career in advertising in 1958 as a mail boy in the Sydney office of [[J. Walter Thompson]] and after five years took a creative role at Berry Currie Advertising. Five years hence he was the Creative Director at that agency. In 1968 together with his Art Director partner Dunc McAllan, he started his own agency in Sydney and the pair soon teamed-up with Rob Palmer and Mike Strauss who had an existing small Melbourne shop with media buying accreditation to start Singleton, Palmer and Strauss, McAllan. SPASM opened with offices in Sydney and Melbourne.

SPASM (and Singleton in particular) are notable in the history of Australian advertising for embracing an [[ocker]] voice in their communications at a time when multi-national agency groups were making their presence felt with the advent of strategic planning and British or American-imitating tones of voice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.api-network.com/main/index.php?apply=scholars&webpage=default&flexedit=&flex_password=&menu_label=&menuID=homely&menubox=&scholar=233 |author=Blackman |title=Post War Advertising in Australia |work=Australian Public Intellectual Network }}</ref>  SPASM's clients were largely local Sydney retailers and rather than using polished voices, Singleton's ads embraced the tone of working-class man. A successful campaign was created for the wholesalers David Holdings. The voice-over screamed the retailer's prices before the irritating catchphrase "Where do you get it?". Similar "low-brow" approaches were taken for [[Jax Tyres]] "Jax the Ripper Tyremen with the deals" and for Hudsons Timber and Hardware using a toothless old handyman spruiking "'udsons with an aitch". Critics derided this style as ocker advertising <ref>{{cite web |author=Crawford, Robert |date=2008 |url=http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/advertising |title=History of Sydney Advertising |work=The Dictionary of Sydney }}</ref> but it would pave the way for the later success of the laconic and self-deprecating style of local Australian advertising such as that created by the [[Mojo (advertising)|Mojo agency]] in the 1980s.

In 1973 Singleton and his partners sold SPASM to the US [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]] and Singleton for a time was Managing Director of DDB's Australian operations. Working for a large multi-national with overseas owners was a challenge for Singleton and he left the business in 1977 triggering a long non-compete provision in his contract. In 1985 Singleton started up again on his own with "John Singleton Advertising". Sydney stockbroker [[Rene Rivkin]] bought a silent-holding in the agency during its development in the 1980s. Singleton developed close ties with the [[Australian Labor Party]] and created the advertising for [[Bob Hawke]]'s successful 1983 election campaign. John Singleton Advertising listed publicly, became the Singleton Group Ltd in 1994, then grew to become the STW Communications Group Ltd in 2002<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.delisted.com.au/Company/4534/JOHN%20SINGLETON%20ADVERTISING%20LIMITED |title=John Singleton Advertising Limited: Listing history |work=Delisted |date=26 February 2002 }}</ref> which now owns over fifty Australian marketing and advertising businesses including the Singleton [[Ogilvy & Mather]] ad agency and holds an interest in [[J. Walter Thompson]]'s Australian operations. Along the way Singleton acquired personal stakes in ventures including the 1990 buy-out of the Ten Group TV network from receivership and an acquisition in 2000 of Indonesia's No 3 network SCTV. These personal holdings in addition to the success and growth STW Group interests enabled Singleton to amass a massive personal fortune.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/article?article_id=98881 |title=Singleton's Advertising Age profile |date=2002 |work=AdAge }}</ref>

==Honours and awards==

In 1994 Singleton was appointed as a [[Order of Australia|Member of the Order of Australia]] for service to the community through his own personal support and fundraising activities more broadly.<ref>{{Cite It's an Honour |ausawardid=873048 |date=10 June 1994 |recipient=John Desmond SINGLETON |award=Member of the Order of Australia |postnominal=AM |citation=AM/FOR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY THROUGH PERSONAL SUPPORT AND FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES FOR CHARITABLE, SPORTING AND RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS.

==Personal life==
He has eight children from six marriages. He has been married to Margaret Wall (Jack born 1971), Maggie Eckardt, [[Belinda Green]] (Jessie born 1982, Sally born 1984), [[Liz Hayes]], Jennifer Murrant - de facto (Joe born 1993, Hannah born 1995) and Julie Martin (Dawnie born 1998, Summer born 2000, Daisy born 2006).<ref>{{cite news |title=The six wives of Singo |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=27 July 2002 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/26/1027497415048.html }}</ref>
