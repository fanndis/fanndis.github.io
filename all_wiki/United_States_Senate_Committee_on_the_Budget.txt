The '''United States Senate Committee on the Budget''' was established by the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]]. It is responsible for drafting Congress's annual [[United States budget process|budget plan]] and monitoring action on the budget for the Federal Government. The committee has jurisdiction over the [[Congressional Budget Office]]. The committee briefly operated as a [[select or special committee (United States Congress)|special committee]] from 1919 to 1920 during the [[66th Congress]], before being made a standing committee in 1974.<ref name=stubbs>{{citation|author=Walter Stubbs|title=Congressional Committees, 1789–1982: A Checklist|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1985|pages=16–17}}</ref>

==Contrasted with other committees==
The Budget Committee is often confused with the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], both of which have different jurisdictions: The Finance Committee is analogous to the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]; it has legislative jurisdiction in the areas of taxes, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]] and some other [[entitlement]]s. The Appropriations Committee has legislative jurisdiction over appropriations bills, which provide funding for government programs.

While the budget resolution prepared by the Budget Committee sets out a broad blueprint for the Congress with respect to the total levels of revenues and spending for the government as a whole, these other Committees prepare bills for specific tax and spending policies.

| 2001<ref>At the beginning of the 107th Congress in January 2001 the Senate was evenly divided. With a Democratic
president and vice president still serving until January 20, the Democratic vice president was available to break a tie,
and the Democrats thus controlled the Senate for 17 days, from January 3 to January 20. On January 3 the Senate
adopted S. Res. 7 designating Democratic senators as committee chairmen to serve during this period and
Republican chairmen to serve effective at noon on January 20, 2001.</ref>
