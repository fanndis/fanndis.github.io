==Overview==
''The Observer'' primarily serves Charlotte and [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg County]] and the surrounding counties of [[Iredell County, North Carolina|Iredell]], [[Cabarrus County, North Carolina|Cabarrus]], [[Union County, North Carolina|Union]], [[Lancaster County, South Carolina|Lancaster]], [[York County, South Carolina|York]], [[Gaston County, North Carolina|Gaston]], [[Catawba County, North Carolina|Catawba]], and [[Lincoln County, North Carolina|Lincoln]].  Home delivery service in outlying counties has declined in recent years, with delivery times growing later as the paper has outsourced circulation services outside the primary Charlotte area.

Circulation at ''The Charlotte Observer'' has been declining for many years. The period of May 2011 showed that ''Charlotte Observer'' circulation totaled 155,497 daily and 212,318 Sunday.  2017 Print Circulation Daily: 69,987 and Sunday: 106,434.<ref name="McClatchy">{{cite web|url=https://www.mcclatchy.com/our-impact/markets/the-charlotte-observer|title=''The Charlotte Observer''|website=mcclatchy.com|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://abcas3.auditedmedia.com/ecirc/newstitlesearchus.asp|title= Total Circ for US Newspapers|date= March 31, 2013|publisher= [[Alliance for Audited Media]]|access-date= June 30, 2013|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://archive.is/20130306175039/http://abcas3.auditedmedia.com/ecirc/newstitlesearchus.asp|archive-date= March 6, 2013}}</ref>

The newspaper has an online presence<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com|title=Breaking News, Sports, Weather & More, The Charlotte Observer|website=charlotteobserver.com|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref> and its staff also oversees a [[NASCAR]] news website,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thatsracin.com/|title=ThatsRacin|website=thatsracin.com}}</ref> and a corresponding syndicated feature, ''That's Racin'''.  The paper's television partner is [[WBTV]].

''The Observer'' offices also include editors and designers that makeup the ''McClatchy NewsDesk-East'', which is responsible for the production of ''The Charlotte Observer'' and ''McClatchy'' newspapers from across the region.

From 1927 to 2016, ''The Charlotte Observer'' was headquartered at 600 South Tryon Street. The facility included editorial offices, management offices, advertising offices, production, plus a large printing facility with a tunnel and underground railway system to feed paper to the presses. In 2016, the editorial offices moved to the NASCAR building on South Caldwell Street. The old facility was demolished and redeveloped into office space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/development/article166073002.html|title=Biz Columns Blogs|website=Charlotte Observer}}</ref>

==History==
The paper was founded in 1886 as the Charlotte Chronicle. The Chronicle was sold to Joseph Caldwell in 1892, and began appearing as the Charlotte Daily Observer on March 13, 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/charlotte-observer|title=NCpedia}}</ref> It was purchased by Knight Newspapers in 1955.  Knight merged with Ridder Publications to form [[Knight Ridder]] in 1974.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Charlotte Observer|last=Claiborne|first=Jack|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1986|isbn=0-8078-1712-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/charlotteobserve0000clai/page/251 251-277]|url=https://archive.org/details/charlotteobserve0000clai/page/251}}</ref> ''The Observer'' eventually became the fourth-largest newspaper in the Knight Ridder chain (behind ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and ''[[Philadelphia Daily News|Daily News]],'' ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' and ''[[Miami Herald]]''). In 1959, ''The Observer'' purchased ''[[The Charlotte News]]'', Charlotte's afternoon newspaper.  All operations were merged except editorial content, which was fused in 1983. ''The Observer'' ended circulation of the afternoon ''News'' in 1985.

McClatchy purchased most of Knight Ridder's newspapers, including ''The Observer'', in 2006. This made ''The Observer'' a sister publication of the state's largest paper, ''[[The News and Observer]]'' of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]; and of ''[[The Herald (Rock Hill)|The Herald]]'' of Rock Hill, the primary newspaper for the South Carolina side of the metro area. As of spring 2008, it is the fifth-largest newspaper in the McClatchy chain (behind ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', ''[[Miami Herald]]'', ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' and ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''). McClatchy's share value has been in decline since the purchase. The stock has lost over 95% of its value, far worse than many remaining newspaper companies.

On March 7, 2020, the ''Observer'' made the Saturday edition digital only.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article240739281.html|title=Local Observer moves to digital Saturdays, with expanded Friday, Sunday print editions|last=Chisenhall|first=Sherry|work=The Charlotte Observer|date=March 1, 2020|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref>
