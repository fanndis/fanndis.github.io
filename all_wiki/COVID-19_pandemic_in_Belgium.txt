The '''COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium''' is part of the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic|worldwide pandemic]] of [[coronavirus disease 2019]] ({{nowrap|COVID-19}}) caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&nbsp;2]] ({{nowrap|SARS-CoV-2}}). The virus was confirmed to have spread to [[Belgium]] on 4 February 2020, when one of a group of nine Belgians repatriated from [[Wuhan]] to [[Brussels]] was reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus.<ref name=FPS_20200204>{{cite web |url= https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/news/one-repatriated-belgian-has-tested-positive-for-the-novel-coronavirus/ |title= One repatriated Belgian has tested positive for the novel coronavirus |date= 4 February 2020 |website= Federal Public Service (FPS) Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment |language= en |access-date= 4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2020/02/16/covid-19-belgian-leaves-hospital/ |title= COVID-19 Belgian leaves hospital |date= 16 February 2020 |website= VRT NWS |language= en |access-date= 16 February 2020}}</ref> Transmission within Belgium was confirmed in early March; authorities linked this to holidaymakers returning from [[Northern Italy]] at the end of the half-term holidays.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/news/6-new-cases-of-covid-19-by-the-end-of-the-spring-holidays/ |title= 6 new cases of Covid-19 by the end of the spring holidays |date= 2 March 2020 |access-date= 8 May 2020 |website= info-coronavirus.be |publisher= Federal Public Service for Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment |language= en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title= Seven confirmed coronavirus cases in Belgium following holiday week|first= Lisa |last=Bradshaw|newspaper= [[The Bulletin (Brussels weekly)#Flanders Today|Flanders Today]]|date= 2 March 2020 |url= http://www.flanderstoday.eu/seven-confirmed-coronavirus-cases-belgium-following-holiday-week}}</ref> The epidemic increased rapidly in March–April 2020.

As of 25 June, the Belgian authorities had reported 61,007 confirmed cases, with a total of 9,726 deaths and at least 17,688 discharged patients. The actual number of infections, however, is likely to be much higher than the number of diagnosed cases, as laboratory tests are limited to specific people and/or people with severe symptoms, and because many people with mild or no symptoms do not seek medical help, even as they are likely to be transmitting the virus.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00822-x |title= Covert coronavirus infections could be seeding new outbreaks |last= Qiu |first= Jane |date= 20 March 2020 |work= Nature |language= en |access-date= 5 April 2020}}</ref>

Belgium is among the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths per head of population in the world. For example, on 1 June 2020, it was reported that there had been 819 deaths per one million head of population, compared to 442 in France, 580 in Spain, 592 in the United Kingdom,<ref>{{Cite web|title= United Kingdom Coronavirus: 301,815 Cases and 42,461 Deaths - Worldometer|url= https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/|access-date= 20 June 2020|website= worldometers.info|language= en}}</ref> and seven in Japan.<ref>Worldometer, 11pm, noted in ''The Times'' on 16 June.</ref> However, Belgium may have been over-reporting the number of cases, with health officials reporting that suspected cases were being reported along with confirmed cases.<ref>{{cite web |title= Coronavirus: Why so many people are dying in Belgium |date= 2 May 2020 |publisher= BBC |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52491210}}</ref> Unlike many other countries, which publish figures based primarily on confirmed hospital deaths, the death figures reported by the Belgian authorities include deaths in the community, especially in care homes, confirmed to have been caused by the coronavirus, as well as a much larger number of such deaths suspected to have been caused by the virus, even if the person was not tested.<ref name=Euronews>

The additional number of people reported as having tested positive for the novel coronavirus peaked on 28 March compared to the previous days.

On 30 March, it was announced that because of the high burden on some hospitals in the provinces of Limburg and Hainaut, a dispersal plan for ICU patients had been activated.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200330_04906592 |title=536 bijkomende opnames in ziekenhuis, 'Kracht van epidemie neemt duidelijk af' |date=30 March 2020 |access-date=30 March 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331100340/https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200330_04906592 |archive-date=31 March 2020 |publisher=De Standaard |language=Dutch}}</ref>

Jan Eyckmans of the [[Federal Public Service Health]] claimed hospitals increased their number of ICUs from 1900 to 2650 over a period of two weeks time, corresponding to an increase from 16.5 to 23.0 ICUs per 100,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200322_04898597 |title='Chinese' krachttoer levert intensieve zorg al 40 procent extra bedden op |date=23 March 2020 |access-date=24 March 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324194634/https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200322_04898597 |archive-date=24 March 2020 |publisher=De Standaard |language=Dutch}}</ref> However, on the daily press conference of the Belgian National Crisis Centre of 28 March Dr Emmanuel André of the UZ Leuven mentioned that the number of 789 ICUs corresponded to 43% of the capacity, bringing the total capacity to 1835 instead of 2650, while Dr Van Gucht quoted the capacity as 2081 units.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/03/27/liveblog-28-maart/ |title=Liveblog - Coronavirus eist meer dan 10.000 levens in Italië, 64 nieuwe overlijdens in ons land |date=28 March 2020 |access-date=28 March 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328194109/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/03/27/liveblog-28-maart/ |archive-date=28 March 2020 |publisher=VRT |language=Dutch}}</ref> The newspaper [[De Standaard]] mentioned the number of 1765 on 31 March<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200330_04907346 |title=Van Italiaans pad af, maar nog niet op Scandinavisch |date=31 March 2020 |access-date=31 March 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401160145/https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200330_04907346 |archive-date=1 April 2020 |publisher=De Standaard |language=Dutch}}</ref> and 2393 on 3 April.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200403_04912008 |title=Hoe bemoedigend zijn de nieuwe cijfers echt? |date=3 April 2020 |publisher=De Standaard |language=Dutch}}</ref>

===April 2020 – first peak===
{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}
At the end of March, it became clear that the peak of the only wave thus far of the pandemic within the country was expected in early April.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/optimisme-kwam-zoals-gevreesd-te-vroeg-modellen-voorspellen-piek-begin-april~a8c5162c/|title=Optimisme kwam zoals gevreesd te vroeg: "Modellen voorspellen piek begin april" |date=26 March 2020 |publisher=HLN |language=Dutch}}</ref> On 8 April, a drop in the number of active hospitalisations could be seen, which meant that a peak in them, and thus perhaps in infections, had been reached a couple days earlier.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200408_04916634 |title=Opnieuw 205 doden, maar 'voor eerst daling van aantal gehospitaliseerde patiënten' |date=8 April 2020 |publisher=De Standaard |language=Dutch}}</ref> The mortality peak would follow a bit later, and was retrospectively observed to have occurred on 12 April.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200421_04929431 |title=Geleidelijke daling aantal overlijdens |date=21 April 2020 |publisher=De Standaard |language=Dutch}}</ref> The peak was 417 deaths in 24 hours.

On 1 June Belgium's [[Prince Joachim of Belgium|Prince Joachim]] issued a public apology following news that he tested positive for COVID-19 after he attended a party in Spain, in violation of the country's lockdown.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/belgium-all-news/health/114563/belgiums-prince-joachim-apologises-for-spanish-lockdown-party/ |title=Belgium's Prince Joachim apologises for Spanish lockdown party |date=1 June 2020 |access-date=6 June 2020 |url-status=live |work=The Brussels Times |language=English}}</ref>

===May 2020===
Starting 4 May 2020, Belgium began gradually to ease the lockdown measures, which were the measures taken from March 18 to combat the spread of the coronavirus. For example, as of 11 May, all shops are allowed to be open for the public but under certain conditions (e.g. visits are limited to 30 minutes).
Cafes and restaurants were allowed to be open as of 8 June.

===June 2020===
In June, 10,000 people demonstrated in Brussels, in the Black Lives Matter demonstration, with corona measures still in place. It was strongly disapproved by Minister President of Flanders Jan Jambon who called it detrimental to the spread of the virus.

===July 2020===
21 July, three [[Chiro Flanders]] youth camps were canceled in West Flanders and Antwerp because 11 leaders were found to be infected.

On 25 July new regulations made it compulsory to wear face coverings in most indoor spaces and busy outdoor spaces. Visitors to a pub have to wear face coverings at least until they have found a seat. Those breaking the rules could be fined up to 250 Euros.

On 27 July, the government published new social distancing rules to come into effect in Belgium from 29 July, whereby the number of closer contacts of separate households was restricted to a group of maximum 5 people (the so-called "bubble of five"). With people who are not part of your bubble, safety distance had to be respected. People could only go to a restaurant within their family and within the bubble.

On 28 July, in response to a flare-up in Antwerp, measures are being tightened locally. E.g. a curfew is being imposed for the entire province. Individuals are required to stay in their homes from 11.30 pm to 6 am. It lasted 1 month.

===August / September 2020 – resurgence===
As of end July and during August and September the number of new corona infections per day began to rise again in Belgium.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/overzicht-kaap-van-100-000-besmettingen-overschreden-in-belgie-cijfers-blijven-stijgen~ac9dc110/|title=Kaap van 100.000 besmettingen overschreden in België, cijfers blijven stijgen|date= 20 September 2020|publisher=HLN |language=Dutch}}</ref> 
Mid September, an average of 1,100 new infections per day were counted.  Belgium had then passed the milestone of 100,000 confirmed coronavirus infections. The number of testing was now much increased. In September an average of more than 30,000 tests were carried out daily compared to ca. 5,000 tests daily begin April. The increased number of tests could partially but not fully explain the increasing number of infections.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-07|title=«La hausse des infections n’est pas uniquement due à l’augmentation du nombre de tests», selon le Centre de crise|url=https://www.lesoir.be/317714/article/2020-08-07/la-hausse-des-infections-nest-pas-uniquement-due-laugmentation-du-nombre-de|access-date=2020-09-30|website=Le Soir|language=fr}}</ref> The percentage of positive COVID-19 cases of all samples taken has risen in September to more than 3%. It was more than 5% at the peak in April and less than 1% at the end of June.
Nevertheless, the number of hospitalised coronavirus patients had continued to remain at a low level. On 18 September, a total of 260 patients were receiving hospital care due to COVID-19, compared to almost 7,000 at the peak of the epidemic.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.tijd.be/dossiers/coronavirus/corona-in-belgie-gemiddeld-bijna-1000-nieuwe-besmettingen-per-dag/10217952.html|title= Corona in België.

On September 17, at least 77 youngsters from West Flanders tested positive for COVID-19 after a holiday in the Portuguese resort of Albufeira.<ref>http://www.brusselstimes.com: [https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/131664/belgian-mayors-race-to-quell-coronavirus-clusters-imported-after-portugal-youth-trip/ ''Belgian mayors race to quell coronavirus clusters after Portugal youth trip'']</ref>

On 24 September, new coronavirus restrictions have been announced by the government. The restrictions were eased on some points. The rule of the bubble of 5 was changed: each person in a household could have closer contact with up to 5 persons, with different persons each month.<ref>[https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-coronavirus-restrictions-fear-of-second-wave/ ''Masks off: Belgium relaxes virus rules despite rise in cases'']</ref>

=== October to present – return to lockdown ===

Beginning of October the average number of daily new infections had risen to 1440. The situation in Belgium was no exception compared to other countries in the EU.

On 30 October, new figures showed that Belgium had the highest infection rate in Europe. As a result, the new Prime Minister, [[Alexander De Croo]] announced that a national lockdown would be reintroduced from 2 November onwards. Non-essential shops were to close, households were only allowed one visitor at a time, and school holidays were extended to 15 November. De Croo said that the restrictions would remain in place until at least mid-December.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54752194</ref>

===Infections at the Doel Nuclear Power Station===
In mid-October 2020, 26 people working at the [[Doel Nuclear Power Station]] tested positive for COVID-19.<ref>De Tijd (16-10-2020)[https://www.tijd.be/ondernemen/algemeen/corona-uitbraak-in-kerncentrale-van-doel/10258430.html Corona infections at the nuclear powerplant Doel]</ref> At that time the possibility of further infections could not be ruled out. Working at home - if possible - was encouraged to control the breakout. The employees affected included some with important tasks in the nuclear power plant. Engie Electrabel assured that the safety of the nuclear power plant would not be compromised. During the first wave in the spring, far fewer infections were detected.

==== Situation in care homes ====
In Belgium, the organisation of care homes falls under the regional authorities. On 11 March the care homes were closed for all visitors in Wallonia and Brussels, and a day later in Flanders.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/vlaamse-rusthuizen-sluiten-deuren-voor-bezoekers-blijf-uit-de-buurt-van-oudere-en-verzwakte-personen~a0a99b74/|title=Vlaamse rusthuizen sluiten deuren voor bezoekers: "Blijf uit de buurt van oudere en verzwakte personen" |date= 11 March 2020 |access-date=9 April 2020 |publisher=HLN|language=Dutch}}</ref>

After the closure, the sector requested more protective equipment, more training and guidelines for caretakers on how to handle infected patients, and more tests. However, not much was changed and the care homes kept operating with a lack of tests and a lack of protective equipment while being required to keep many infected residents in the homes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hln.be/in-de-buurt/gent/rusthuismedewerkers-maken-zelf-mondmaskers-om-bewoners-beter-te-beschermen~aaeac890/ |title=Rusthuismedewerkers maken zelf mondmaskers om bewoners beter te beschermen |date=18 March 2020 |access-date=9 April 2020 |publisher=HLN|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.tijd.be/dossiers/coronavirus/zwakste-rusthuisbewoners-met-corona-gaan-niet-naar-ziekenhuis/10216345.html |title=Zwakste rusthuisbewoners met corona gaan niet naar ziekenhuis |date=24 March 2020 |access-date=9 April 2020 |publisher=HLN|language=Dutch}}</ref> On Wednesday 1 April, the government finally promised to also provide more tests to the care homes by the end of the week.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/ruim-4-000-coronatesten-per-dag-ook-in-woonzorgcentra-zal-getest-worden~ae622a99/ |title=Ruim 4.000 coronatesten per dag, ook in woonzorgcentra zal getest worden |date=1 April 2020 |access-date=9 April 2020 |publisher=HLN|language=Dutch}}</ref> But as that deadline wasn't met, on Saturday 4 April, several care homes started to execute tests on their own.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/woonzorgcentra-testen-op-eigen-houtje-bewoners-en-personeel-niemand-weet-hoe-erg-het-is~a4b1fd3e/ |title=Woonzorgcentra testen op eigen houtje bewoners en personeel: "Niemand weet hoe erg het is" |date=4 April 2020 |access-date=9 April 2020 |publisher=HLN|language=Dutch}}</ref> Meanwhile, several homes got hit hard with dozens of deaths, and up 90% of the residents and inhabitants being infected.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hbvl.be/cnt/dmf20200409_04917953/in-dit-rusthuis-vielen-al-26-slachtoffers-de-geur-die-er-hing-blijft-me-bij |title=In dit rusthuis vielen al 26 slachtoffers: "De geur die er hing blijft me bij" |date=9 April 2020 |access-date=9 April 2020 |publisher=HBVL |language=Dutch}}</ref> These events led to severe criticism addressing the Flemish minister of public health [[Wouter Beke]]. Care organisations accused the minister of losing 3 weeks time, and being very late with an emergency plan.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20200408_04917327 |title="Drie weken tijd verloren voor rusthuizen": hoe kon het zolang duren voordat er een noodplan was? |date=9 April 2020 |access-date=9 April 2020 |publisher=Het Nieuwsblad|language=Dutch}}</ref> Only on 21 April, masks were advised for all personnel in contact with patients.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/richtlijnen-voor-mondmaskers-aangepast-in-woonzorgcentra~a49855ce/ |title=Richtlijnen voor mondmaskers aangepast in woonzorgcentra |website=Het Laatste Nieuws |date=21 April 2020}}</ref>

====High death toll and unusual method of counting====
In April, Belgium had very high mortality figures, the highest death rate from [[COVID-19]] in the world at that time.<ref name=Euronews/><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/belgium-all-news/107068/coronavirus-belgium-tops-the-world-in-number-of-deaths-in-relation-to-population/ |title=Coronavirus: Belgium tops the world in number of deaths in relation to population |date=19 April 2020 |access-date=29 April 2020 |work=The Brussels Times|language=en}}</ref>

Steven Van Gucht from [[Sciensano]] explained this was partly due to a difference in counting, compared to other countries.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/belgie-neemt-bijna-leiding-in-aantal-coronadoden-per-miljoen-inwoners-zijn-we-dan-zo-slecht-bezig-manier-van-tellen-is-anders~a7f169a2/ |title=België neemt bijna leiding in aantal coronadoden per miljoen inwoners: zijn we dan zo slecht bezig?

This way of counting was criticised by Flemish Minister for Tourism, [[Zuhal Demir]], as it would portray Belgium as bad in the fight against coronavirus and also would harm the Belgian reputation of being a prominent country in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-21|title=Coronavirus: Belgium's high death toll will deter tourists|url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/business/107423/coronavirus-belgiums-high-death-toll-will-deter-tourists/|access-date=2020-09-29|website=The Brussels Times|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.tijd.be/politiek-economie/belgie/federaal/nieuw-gemor-over-belgische-rapportering-coronadoden/10220849.html |title=Nieuw gemor over Belgische rapportering coronadoden |date=16 April 2020 |access-date=30 April 2020 |publisher=De Tijd |language=nl}}</ref> Some doctors complained that deaths caused by other pathologies and causes have been lumped into the COVID-19 category.<ref name="euractiv20200417">{{Cite news |url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/belgium-says-transparency-explains-high-virus-death-toll/ |title=Belgium says transparency explains high virus death toll |date=17 April 2020 |access-date=29 April 2020 |publisher=EURACTIV |language=en}}</ref> The virologist [[Marc Van Ranst]], member of the Belgian Scientific Committee for Coronavirus, also criticised the way of counting, saying it is "dumb" that almost all deaths occurring in care homes are being counted as COVID-19 deaths, leading to an overestimation according to him.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/belgium-all-news/106411/coronavirus-counting-all-deaths-in-care-centres-is-dumb/ |title=Coronavirus: Counting all deaths in care centres is 'dumb' |date=15 April 2020 |access-date=29 April 2020 |work=The Brussels Times|language=en}}</ref>

Belgian authorities however defend their strategy for being the most transparent and the most detailed method,<ref name="euractiv20200417"/> even if it results in numbers that are "sometimes overestimated".<ref name="brusselstimes20200420">{{Cite news |url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/belgium-all-news/107216/coronavirus-how-did-belgium-get-the-highest-mortality-rate/ |title=Why does Belgium have so many Coronavirus deaths? |date=20 April 2020 |access-date=29 April 2020 |work=The Brussels Times|language=en}}</ref> According to Steven Van Gucht, responsible for the reporting strategy, the suspected deaths are being counted as COVID-19 deaths because not everyone can be tested<ref name="brusselstimes20200420"/> but said this way of counting saved lives by pointing to the dire situation the care homes were in.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.gva.be/cnt/dmf20200417_04925302/belgie-wereldleider-aantal-overlijdens-per-100-000-inwoners-onze-telwijze-heeft-levens-gered| title=België wereldleider aantal overlijdens per 100.000 inwoners: "Onze telwijze heeft levens gered" |date=17 April 2020 |access-date=30 April 2020 |publisher=GVA |language=nl}}</ref> After this criticism, the official daily reports started to distinguish the deaths figures between confirmed tested and simply suspected cases.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://businessam.be/313-overlijdens-in-een-dag-belgie-telt-meeste-doden-per-100-000-inwoners-wereldwijd/ |title=313 overlijdens in een dag: België telt meeste doden per 100.000 inwoners wereldwijd |date=17 April 2020 |access-date=29 April 2020 |publisher=Business AM |language=nl}}</ref>

When several countries published [[excess mortality]] figures, it appeared that the criticised way {{who|date=June 2020}} of counting caused the reported [[COVID-19]] death toll in Belgium to be closer to the excess mortality figures, compared to other countries.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://multimedia.tijd.be/oversterfte/ |title=De ware impact van corona |date=24 April 2020 |access-date=30 April 2020 |publisher=De Tijd |language=nl}}</ref> For example, between 5 March and 5 April, Belgium reported 2,373 COVID-19 deaths with the excess mortality being estimated around 3,000. Causing still an underreporting of around 600 deaths. While the neighbouring Netherlands had an estimated excess mortality of 6,200, with only 3,197 reported COVID-19 deaths in that same period. Causing an underreporting of around 3000 deaths.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html |title=40,000 Missing Deaths: Tracking the True Toll of the Coronavirus Outbreak |date=27 April 2020 |access-date=29 April 2020 |work=The New York Times |language=en}}</ref> According to professor Yves Van Laethem, Belgium uses the approach recommended by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] and the [[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]], which congratulated Belgium for choosing this approach.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-15|title=Belgium boasts coronavirus death count accuracy|url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/111815/coronavirus-belgiums-death-count-matches-reality-for-almost-100/|access-date=2020-09-29|website=The Brussels Times|language=en}}</ref>

====Confirmed infections====
The number of confirmed infections is the number of samples tested positive by a reference laboratory. It is estimated that the actual number of cases is much higher than the number of confirmed cases,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lalibre.be/planete/sante/coronavirus-pourquoi-le-nombre-de-cas-detectes-en-belgique-ne-represente-pas-grand-chose-5e67ab369978e201d8b553ac/ |title=Coronavirus : pourquoi le nombre de cas détectés en Belgique ne représente pas grand-chose |date=10 March 2020 |website=lalibre.be |language=fr |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328154646/https://www.lalibre.be/planete/sante/coronavirus-pourquoi-le-nombre-de-cas-detectes-en-belgique-ne-represente-pas-grand-chose-5e67ab369978e201d8b553ac |archive-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> the tests being limited to specific people and/or to people with severe symptoms. Diagnosed cases are an underestimate of the real number by a factor of between 5 and 10 according to Professor Marc Van Ranst.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/marc-van-ranst-werkelijk-aantal-besmettingen-ligt-waarschijnlijk-tien-keer-hoger~abf10dad/ |title=Marc Van Ranst: "Werkelijk aantal besmettingen ligt waarschijnlijk tien keer hoger" |date=9 March 2020 |website=hln.be |language=nl |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328154645/https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/marc-van-ranst-werkelijk-aantal-besmettingen-ligt-waarschijnlijk-tien-keer-hoger~abf10dad/ |archive-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>

In the period of 1 to 6 March the number of detected cases [[exponential growth|grew on average exponentially]] with a doubling of the number of cases every day. In the period between 7 and 27 March the number of confirmed cases doubled on average every 3.7{{nbsp}}days (20.9{{nbsp}}% daily increase).{{Update inline|reason=Analysis based on reporting dates|date=April 2020}}

====Recoveries====
The official reports from the [[Sciensano|national public health institute of Belgium]] do not refer to ''recovered'' people but only to ''discharged'' patients.

The patients are discharged after resolution of symptoms, even though they are not being tested again before leaving the hospital.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/dossier/epidemie-de-coronavirus/detail_coronavirus-en-belgique-combien-y-a-t-il-de-patients-gueris?id=10464928 |title=Coronavirus en Belgique : combien y a-t-il de patients guéris ? |date=23 March 2020 |access-date=30 March 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324151208/https://www.rtbf.be/info/dossier/epidemie-de-coronavirus/detail_coronavirus-en-belgique-combien-y-a-t-il-de-patients-gueris?id=10464928 |archive-date=24 March 2020 |publisher=[[RTBF]] |language=French}}</ref> The number of recovered people who were tested positive but not admitted to hospital remains unknown as there is no follow-up on these cases.

On 25 March 2020, Belgium ranked 6th in the list of EU countries with the highest numbers of casualties, while on 1 April Belgium had the third highest death toll after Italy and Spain. As of 3 April the [[case fatality rate]] of the COVID-19 disease is in Belgium similar to the neighbouring countries The Netherlands and France but much higher than in Germany. However, not all countries count the deaths in the same way.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200401-coronavirus-why-death-and-mortality-rates-differ |title=Coronavirus: Why death and mortality rates differ |date=2 April 2020 |access-date=10 April 2020 |publisher=BBC |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/31/counting-coronavirus-different-countries-calculating-death-tolls/ |title=Counting coronavirus: How are different countries calculating death tolls, and can you trust them? |date=31 March 2020 |access-date=10 April 2020 |newspaper=The Telegraph |language=en}}</ref> Belgium counts deaths occurring both in hospitals and elsewhere, like in care homes.

Unlike most neighbouring countries ([[COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[COVID-19 pandemic in France|France]], [[COVID-19 pandemic in Germany|Germany]] and the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|UK]]), the Belgian authorities were initially not willing to provide information or statistics on where the cases are located, beyond statistics for each region: Flanders, Brussels and [[Wallonia]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20200305_04877096 |title=Waarom ons land niet zegt waar de coronapatiënten wonen |date=5 March 2020 |access-date=7 March 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200306155846/https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20200305_04877096 |archive-date=6 March 2020 |agency=De Morgen |language=Dutch}}</ref>

Sciensano started to publish statistics per province starting 18 March. In the period between 17 and 21 March it became clear that the province of Limburg was a hotspot for the coronavirus where the incidence grew much faster compared to the rest of the country: while on 17 March the incidence in Limburg was 1.5 times the average incidence for the country, this had already increased to 1.9 times the average incidence on 21 March.<ref name=situatie/>

Sciensano started to publish a map with incidence numbers per municipality starting 26 March.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The daily Sciensano report of 28 March saw a spectacular rise of the incidence numbers for the province of Liège: from 19 confirmed cases per 100{{nbsp}}000 population on 27 March it rose to 77. This was due to underreporting by a lab in the province.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.lalibre.be/planete/sante/coronavirus-en-belgique-la-province-de-liege-apparait-desormais-fortement-touchee-le-point-region-par-region-cartes-5e7fce8b7b50a6162bd70b5d |title=Coronavirus en Belgique: la province de Liège apparaît désormais fortement touchée, le point région par région (CARTES) |date=28 March 2020 |access-date=29 March 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329064109/https://www.lalibre.be/planete/sante/coronavirus-en-belgique-la-province-de-liege-apparait-desormais-fortement-touchee-le-point-region-par-region-cartes-5e7fce8b7b50a6162bd70b5d |archive-date=29 March 2020 |agency=La Libre Belgique |language=French}}</ref> On 29 March the province of Liège even became the second worst affected province in Belgium after Limburg.

We can make out two phases separated by the yellow vertical line. One from 15 March 2020 until 31 March 2020 (with a fit in green) and the one from 1 April 2020 until 14 May 2020 (with a fit in blue).

The initial phase (green) had exponential growth/decline rate of 29.3% and the total number of cumulated hospitalised cases stabilises at 7948. The second phase (blue) has exponential growth/decline rate of 9.44% and the total number of cumulated hospitalised cases stabilises at 16878.

Also shown in purple is the fitted new hospitalisations from 1 April 2020 until 14 May 2020 (corresponding to the blue fit for cumulative data).
Beyond 14 May the curves shown are only a trend according to the logistic growth model, these have an uncertainty range associated to them and should not be seen as a prediction. ]]
