==Titles and succession==

Charlotte is, from birth, a [[princess of the United Kingdom]] entitled to the style of [[Royal Highness]] under [[letters patent]] issued by Queen Elizabeth II on 31 December 2012, which gave the title and style to all children of the Prince of Wales's elder son.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=60384|page=213|date=8 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Royal baby girl 'would be princess'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20962102|date=9 January 2013|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref> She is thus styled "Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge".<ref name="HRH"/>
