A '''teacher''' (also called a '''school teacher''' or, in some contexts, an '''educator''') is a person who helps [[Student|students]] to acquire [[knowledge]], competence or [[virtue]].

''Informally'' the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone (e.g. when showing a colleague how to perform a specific task). 
In some countries, teaching young people of school age may be carried out in an informal setting, such as within the family ([[homeschooling]]), rather than in a formal setting such as a school or college. 
Some other professions may involve a significant amount of teaching (e.g. youth worker, pastor).

In most countries, ''formal'' teaching of students is usually carried out by paid professional teachers. This article focuses on those who are ''employed'', as their main role, to teach others in a ''formal'' [[education]] context, such as at a school or other place of ''initial'' formal education or training.

==Duties and functions==
A teacher's role may vary among cultures.

Teachers may provide instruction in [[Literacy education|literacy]] and [[numeracy]], [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] or [[vocational training]], [[the arts]], [[religion]], [[civics]], community roles, or life skills.

Formal teaching tasks include preparing lessons according to agreed curricula, giving lessons, and assessing pupil progress.

A teacher's professional duties may extend beyond formal teaching. Outside of the classroom teachers may accompany students on field trips, supervise [[study hall]]s, help with the organization of school functions, and serve as supervisors for [[extracurricular activities]]. 
In some education systems, teachers may be responsible for student [[discipline]].

==Competences and qualities required by teachers==

Teaching is a highly complex activity.<ref name="Caena">For a review of literature on competences required by teachers, see F Caena (2011) 'Literature review: Teachers’ core competences:  
requirements and development' accessed January 2017 at {{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109184019/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |archive-date=9 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
This is partially because teaching is a social practice, that takes place in a specific context (time, place, culture, socio-political-economic situation etc.) and therefore is shaped by the values of that specific context.<ref name="Cochrane">for a useful discussion see, for example: Cochran-Smith,  M.  (2006): 'Policy,  Practice,  and  Politics  in  Teacher  Education',  Thousand  Oaks,  CA:  Corwin Press</ref> Factors that influence what is expected (or required) of teachers include history and tradition, social views about the purpose of education, accepted theories about learning, etc.<ref name="Cummings">see for example Cummings, W.K. (2003) 'The   Institutions   of   Education.  A   Comparative   Study   of   Educational Development in the Six Core Nations', Providence, MA:
Symposium Books.</ref>

===Competences===
The competences required by a teacher are affected by the different ways in which the role is understood around the world. Broadly, there seem to be four models: 
:the teacher as manager of instruction; 
:the teacher as caring person; 
:the teacher as expert learner; and 
:the teacher as cultural and civic person.<ref name="Caena2">F Caena (2011) 'Literature review: Teachers’ core competences: requirements and development' accessed January 2017 at {{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109184019/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |archive-date=9 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }} citing Altet et al., 1996; Conway et al., 2010; Hansen, 2008; Seifert, 1999; Sockett, 2008</ref>

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has argued that it is necessary to develop a shared definition of the skills and knowledge required by teachers, in order to guide  teachers' career-long education and professional development.<ref name ="OECD">'Teachers  Matter:  Attracting,  Developing  and  Retaining  Effective Teachers', 2005, Paris: OECD publications [http://www.oecd.org/edu/teacherpolicy]</ref> Some evidence-based international discussions have tried to reach such a common understanding. For example, the [[European Union]] has identified three broad areas of competences that teachers require:
:Working with others
:Working with knowledge, technology and information, and
:Working in and with society.<ref name="Caena3">F Caena (2011) 'Literature review: Teachers’ core competences: requirements and development' accessed January 2017 at {{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109184019/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |archive-date=9 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Scholarly consensus is emerging that what is required of teachers can be grouped under three headings:
:knowledge (such as: the subject matter itself and knowledge about how to teach it, curricular knowledge, knowledge about the educational sciences, psychology, assessment etc.) 
:craft skills (such as lesson planning, using teaching technologies, managing students and groups, monitoring and assessing learning etc.) and 
:dispositions (such as essential values and attitudes, beliefs and commitment).<ref name="Will">Williamson  McDiarmid, G.  &  Clevenger-Bright  M.  (2008) 'Rethinking  Teacher  Capacity', in  Cochran-Smith,  M.,  Feiman-Nemser,  S.  &  Mc  Intyre,  D.  (Eds.).  'Handbook  of  Research  on  
Teacher  Education. Enduring questions in changing contexts'. New York/Abingdon: Routledge/Taylor & Francis cited in F Caena (2011)</ref>

===Qualities===

====Enthusiasm====

[[File:Ashs-teacher-and-students.jpg|thumb|A teacher interacts with older students at a school in New Zealand]]

It has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can create a positive learning experience.<ref>Teaching Patterns: a Pattern Language for Improving the Quality of Instruction in Higher Education Settings by Daren Olson. Page 96</ref> These teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to invigorate their teaching of the course materials everyday.<ref>Motivated Student: Unlocking the Enthusiasm for Learning by Bob Sullo. Page 62</ref> Teachers who cover the same curriculum repeatedly may find it challenging to maintain their enthusiasm, lest their boredom with the content bore their students in turn. Enthusiastic teachers are rated higher by their students than teachers who didn't show much enthusiasm for the course materials.<ref>Barkley, S., & Bianco, T. (2006). The Wonder of Wows. Kappa Delta Pi Record, 42(4), 148-151.</ref>
[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|A primary school teacher on a picnic with her students, [[Colombia]], 2014]]
Teachers that exhibit enthusiasm are more likely to have engaged, interested and energetic students who are curious about learning the subject matter. Recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom.<ref name="auto">Patrick, B.C., Hisley, J. & Kempler, T. (2000) "What's Everybody so Excited about?": The Effects of Teacher Enthusiasm on Student Intrinsic Motivation and Vitality", The Journal of Experimental Education, Vol. 68, No. 3, pp. 217-236</ref> Controlled, experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial expressions, result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Douglas M.|title=The Teacher's Communicative Competence: The First Day of School|journal=Theory into Practice|date=1985|volume=24|issue=1|page=63|doi=10.1080/00405848509543148}}</ref> But even while a teacher's enthusiasm has been shown to improve motivation and increase task engagement, it does not necessarily improve learning outcomes or memory for the material.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Motz|first1=B. A.|last2=de Leeuw|first2=J. R.|last3=Carvalho|first3=P. F.|last4=Liang|first4=K. L.|last5=Goldstone|first5=R. L.|title=A dissociation between engagement and learning: Enthusiastic instructions fail to reliably improve performance on a memory task|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2017|volume=12|issue=7|page=e0181775|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0181775|pmid=28732087|df=dmy-all|pmc=5521834}}</ref>

There are various mechanisms by which teacher enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.in/dr-anil-k-rajvanshi/all-of-us-should-be-teachers-even-if-just-for-one-day/ All Of Us Should Be Teachers, Even If Just For One Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009112708/http://www.huffingtonpost.in/dr-anil-k-rajvanshi/all-of-us-should-be-teachers-even-if-just-for-one-day/ |date=9 October 2016 }}, Huffington Post, 27 September 2016</ref> 
Teacher enthusiasm may contribute to a classroom atmosphere of energy and enthusiasm which feeds student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter.<ref>Amatora, M. (1950). Teacher Personality: Its Influence on Pupils. Education, 71(3), 154-158</ref>  Enthusiastic teachers may also lead to students becoming more self-determined in their own learning process. The concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher's enthusiasm may contribute to the student's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning.  Also, enthusiasm may act as a "motivational embellishment", increasing a student's interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher's presentation of the material. Finally, the concept of emotional contagion may also apply: students may become more intrinsically motivated by catching onto the enthusiasm and energy of the teacher.<ref name="auto"/>

====Interaction with learners====
Research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher relationships. Enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students. Their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students.<ref>Baker, J. A., Terry, T., Bridger, R., & Winsor, A. (1997). Schools as caring communities: A relational approach to school reform. School Psychology Review, 26, 576-588.</ref><ref name="Bryant, Jennings 1980">Bryant, Jennings . 1980.

Salzberger, I.; Wittenberg, G. W. 1999. The Emotional Experience of Learning and Teaching.  Karnac Books, London.</ref> Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving themselves, whereas academic success includes the goals they receive from their superior. A teacher must guide their student in aligning their personal goals with their academic goals. Students who receive this positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions.<ref name="Hartmut, J. 1978"/><ref name="ReferenceA">Baker, J.

Evaluating Educational Environments: Measures, procedures, findings, and policy implications. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.</ref>

Students are likely to build stronger relations with teachers who are friendly and supportive and will show more interest in courses taught by these teachers.<ref name="Osborne, E. 1999"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> Teachers that spend more time interacting and working directly with students are perceived as supportive and effective teachers. Effective teachers have been shown to invite student participation and decision making, allow humor into their classroom, and demonstrate a willingness to play.<ref name="Bryant, Jennings 1980"/>

==Teaching qualifications==
In many countries, a person who wishes to become a teacher must first obtain [[Certified teacher|specified professional qualifications or credentials]] from a [[university]] or [[college]]. These professional qualifications may include the study of [[pedagogy]], the science of teaching. 
Teachers, like other professionals, may have to, or choose to, continue their education after they qualify, a process known as [[continuing professional development]].

The issue of teacher qualifications is linked to the status of the profession. In some societies, teachers enjoy a status on a par with [[physician]]s, [[lawyer]]s, [[engineer]]s, and [[accountants]], in others, the status of the profession is low. In the twentieth century, many intelligent women were unable to get jobs in corporations or governments so many chose teaching as a default profession. As women become more welcomed into corporations and governments today, it may be more difficult to attract qualified teachers in the future.

Teachers are often required to undergo a course of initial education at a  [[College of Education]] to ensure that they possess the necessary knowledge, competences and adhere to relevant [[Ethical code|codes of ethics]].

There are a variety of bodies designed to instill, preserve and update the knowledge and professional standing of teachers. Around the world many teachers' colleges exist; they may be controlled by government or by the teaching profession itself.

They are generally established to serve and protect the public interest through [[certify]]ing, governing, quality controlling, and enforcing standards of practice for the teaching profession.

===Professional standards===
The functions of the teachers' colleges may include setting out clear standards of practice, providing for the ongoing education of teachers, investigating complaints involving members, conducting hearings into [[allegation]]s of professional misconduct and taking appropriate disciplinary action and [[accredit]]ing teacher education programs. In many situations teachers in [[Public school (government funded)|publicly funded schools]] must be members in good standing with the college, and [[private school]]s may also require their teachers to be college members. In other areas these roles may belong to the State [[Board of Education]], the [[Superintendent of Public Instruction]], the [[State Education Agency]] or other governmental bodies. In still other areas [[Teaching Union]]s may be responsible for some or all of these duties.

====Professional misconduct====
{{See also|Child abuse}}

Misconduct by teachers, especially [[sexual misconduct]], has been getting increased scrutiny from the media and the courts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goorian |first=Brad |date=December 1999 |title=Sexual Misconduct by School Employees |journal=[[ERIC|ERIC Digest]] |issue=134 |page=1 |id=ERIC #: ED436816 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/15/fd/90.pdf |accessdate= 2008-01-17 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227085217/http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/15/fd/90.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 27 February 2008}}</ref> A study by the [[American Association of University Women]] reported that 9.6% of students in the United States claim to have received unwanted sexual attention from an adult associated with education; be they a volunteer, bus driver, teacher, administrator or other adult; sometime during their educational career.<ref name=DOEd>{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf#p28 |title=Educator Sexual Misconduct: A Synthesis of Existing Literature |accessdate=2008-01-17 |last=Shakeshaft |first=Charol |date=June 2004 |format=PDF |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Education]], Office of the Under Secretary |page=28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411133905/http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf#p28 |archive-date=11 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A study in England showed a 0.3% prevalence of sexual abuse by any professional, a group that included [[priest]]s, religious leaders, and case workers as well as teachers.<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf#p28 Educator Sexual Misconduct: A Synthesis of Existing Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411133905/http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf |date=11 April 2008 }} see page 8 and page 20</ref> It is important to note, however, that this British study is the only one of its kind and consisted of "a random ... probability sample of 2,869 young people between the ages of 18 and 24 in a computer-assisted study" and that the questions referred to "sexual abuse with a professional," not necessarily a teacher. It is therefore logical to conclude that information on the percentage of abuses by teachers in the United Kingdom is not explicitly available and therefore not necessarily reliable. The AAUW study, however, posed questions about fourteen types of sexual harassment and various degrees of frequency and included only abuses by teachers. "The sample was drawn from a list of 80,000 schools to create a stratified two-stage sample design of 2,065 8th to 11th grade students". Its reliability was gauged at 95% with a 4% margin of error.

In the [[United States]] especially, several high-profile cases such as [[Debra LaFave]], [[Pamela Rogers Turner]], and [[Mary Kay Letourneau]] have caused increased scrutiny on teacher misconduct.

[[Chris Keates]], the general secretary of [[National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers]], said that teachers who have sex with pupils over the age of consent should not be placed on the sex offenders register and that prosecution for statutory rape "is a real anomaly in the law that we are concerned about." This has led to outrage from child protection and parental rights groups.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,432881,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Union Official: Teachers Who Engage in Consensual Sex With Teen Pupils Shouldn't Face Prosecution | date=6 October 2008 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010220256/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,432881,00.html | archive-date=10 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Fears of being labelled a [[pedophile]] or [[hebephile]] has led to several men who enjoy teaching avoiding the profession.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kissen|first1=Rita|title=Getting Ready for Benjamin: Preparing Teachers for Sexual Diversity in the classroom|date=2002|page=62}}</ref> This has in some jurisdictions reportedly led to a shortage of male teachers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s72521.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-26 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030822201605/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s72521.htm |archive-date=22 August 2003 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Pedagogy and teaching==
{{Main|Pedagogy}}

[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 007.jpg|thumb|Dutch schoolmaster and children, 1662]]
[[File:Teacher in Laos.jpg|thumb|A primary school teacher in northern [[Laos]]]]
[[File:Rostock Schmidt Lehrer-Student.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The teacher-student-monument in [[Rostock]], Germany, honors teachers]]

Teachers facilitate student learning, often in a school or academy or perhaps in another environment such as [[Outdoor education|outdoors]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-13055-0008, Hohendorf, JP mit Dorflehrer.jpg|thumb|[[East Germany|GDR]] "village teacher", a teacher teaching students of all age groups in one class in 1951]]
[[File:Jewish Children with their Teacher in Samarkand cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jew]]ish children with their teacher in [[Samarkand]], the beginning of the 20th century.]]
The objective is typically accomplished through either an [[Informal learning|informal]] or formal approach to learning, including a course of study and [[lesson plan]] that teaches [[skill]]s, [[knowledge]] or [[thinking]] skills. Different ways to teach are often referred to as [[pedagogy]]. When deciding what teaching method to use teachers consider students' background knowledge, environment, and their learning goals as well as standardized [[curricula]] as determined by the relevant authority. Many times, teachers assist in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips. The increasing use of [[technology]], specifically the rise of the [[internet]] over the past decade, has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the [[classroom]].

The objective is typically a course of study, [[lesson plan]], or a practical skill. A teacher may follow standardized [[Curriculum|curricula]] as determined by the relevant authority. The teacher may interact with students of different ages, from infants to adults, students with different abilities and students with learning [[disabilities]].

Teaching using pedagogy also involve assessing the educational levels of the students on particular skills. Understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom involves using [[differentiated instruction]] as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom. Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners. First, teaching itself can be taught in many different ways, hence, using a [[pedagogy of teaching styles]]. Second, the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of their students and differentiates for the individual students accordingly. For example, an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows: "The real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop. The function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy, inspire the bored, deflate the cocky, encourage the timid, detect and correct individual flaws, and broaden the viewpoint of all. This function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game."<ref>Walter Evans (1965) letter to Roy Glasgow of Naval Postgraduate School, quoted by his son Gregory Walter Evans (December 2004) "Bringing Root Locus to the Classroom", [[IEEE Control Systems Magazine]], page 81</ref>

Perhaps the most significant difference between [[primary school]] and [[secondary school]] teaching is the relationship between teachers and children. In primary schools each class has a teacher who stays with them for most of the week and will teach them the whole curriculum. In secondary schools they will be taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers. The relationship between children and their teachers tends to be closer in the primary school where they act as form tutor, specialist teacher and surrogate parent during the course of the day.

This is true throughout most of the United States as well. However, alternative approaches for primary education do exist. One of these, sometimes referred to as a "platoon" system, involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject. The advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects. Students still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes.

[[Co-teaching]] has also become a new trend amongst educational institutions. Co-teaching is defined as two or more teachers working harmoniously to fulfill the needs of every student in the classroom. Co-teaching focuses the student on learning by providing a [[social networking]] support that allows them to reach their full cognitive potential. Co-teachers work in sync with one another to create a climate of learning.

===Classroom management===

====Teachers and school discipline====
{{Main|School discipline|School punishment|School corporal punishment}}

Throughout the [[history of education]] the most common form of [[school discipline]] was [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]]. While a child was in school, a teacher was expected to act as a [[in loco parentis|substitute parent]], with all the normal forms of parental discipline open to them. [[File:Koerperstrafe- MA Birkenrute.png|thumb|Medieval schoolboy birched on the bare buttocks]]

In past times, corporal punishment ([[spanking]] or [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] or [[caning]] or [[Strapping (punishment)|strapping]] or [[birching]] the student in order to cause physical pain) was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world. Most Western countries, and some others, have now banned it, but it remains lawful in the United States following a US Supreme Court decision in 1977 which held that paddling did not violate the US Constitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x4615.xml |title=Ingraham v. Wright |publisher=Bucknell.edu |accessdate=2011-07-31 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908060547/http://www.bucknell.edu/x4615.xml |archive-date=8 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

30 US states have banned corporal punishment, the others (mostly in [[Southern United States|the South]]) have not. It is still used to a significant (though declining) degree in some public schools in [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Texas]]. Private schools in these and most other states may also use it. Corporal punishment in American schools is administered to the seat of the student's trousers or skirt with a specially made wooden paddle. This often used to take place in the classroom or hallway, but nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal's office.

Official corporal punishment, often by caning, remains commonplace in schools in some Asian, African and Caribbean countries.

Currently detention is one of the most common punishments in schools in the United States, the UK, Ireland, Singapore and other countries. It requires the pupil to remain in school at a given time in the school day (such as lunch, recess or after school); or even to attend school on a non-school day, e.g. "Saturday detention" held at some schools. During detention, students normally have to sit in a classroom and do work, write lines or a punishment essay, or sit quietly.

A modern example of school discipline in North America and Western Europe relies upon the idea of an assertive teacher who is prepared to impose their will upon a class. Positive reinforcement is balanced with immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior and firm, clear boundaries define what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Teachers are expected to respect their students; sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils are seen as falling outside of what constitutes reasonable discipline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.feaonline.org/media/members/onepapers/Maintaining_Classroom_Discipline.pdf|title=Maintaining Classroom Discipline|website=Federal Education Association}}</ref>

Whilst this is the consensus viewpoint amongst the majority of academics, some teachers and parents advocate a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline<ref>{{Cite book|title=Classroom Management: Sound Theory and Effective Practice|last=Tauber|first=Robert T.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|isbn=9780275996680|pages= 112}}</ref> (refer to ''Canter Model of Discipline'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/dcheney/EDSPE503ClassroomManagement/Readings/CanterChapter.pdf|title=Building Classroom Discipline|last=Charles|first=C.M|date=2005|website=University of Washington}}</ref> Such individuals claim that many problems with modern schooling stem from the weakness in school discipline and if teachers exercised firm control over the classroom they would be able to teach more efficiently. This viewpoint is supported by the educational attainment of countries—in East Asia for instance—that combine strict discipline with high standards of education.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=School discipline, school uniforms and academic performance|journal=International Journal of Educational Management|volume=30|issue=6|pages=1003–1029|last=Baumann|first=Chris|date=2016|doi=10.1108/IJEM-09-2015-0118}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hkier.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/journal/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/erj_v24n2_327-348.pdf|title=Characteristics of East Asian Learners: What We Learned From PISA|last=Sui-chu Ho|first=Esther|date=2009|website=hkier.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/strict-classroom-discipline-improves-student-outcomes-and-work-ethic-studies-find-20161108-gsksiq.html|title=Strict classroom discipline improves student outcomes and work ethic, studies find|last=Munro|first=Kelsey|date=November 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317101745/https://www.smh.com.au/education/strict-classroom-discipline-improves-student-outcomes-and-work-ethic-studies-find-20161108-gsksiq.html|archive-date=2018-03-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>

It's not clear, however that this stereotypical view reflects the reality of East Asian classrooms or that the educational goals in these countries are commensurable with those in Western countries. In [[Japan]], for example, although average attainment on standardized tests may exceed those in Western countries, classroom discipline and behavior is highly problematic. Although, officially, schools have extremely rigid codes of behavior, in practice many teachers find the students unmanageable and do not enforce discipline at all.

Where school class sizes are typically 40 to 50 students, maintaining order in the classroom can divert the teacher from instruction, leaving little opportunity for concentration and focus on what is being taught. In response, teachers may concentrate their attention on motivated students, ignoring [[attention-seeking]] and disruptive students. The result of this is that motivated students, facing demanding university entrance examinations, receive disproportionate resources. Given the emphasis on attainment of university places, administrators and governors may regard this policy as appropriate.

{{Main|School discipline#Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools|l1=Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools}}

[[Sudbury model]] democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike. They also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else. Primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole, thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation, rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront. Sudbury model democratic schools' proponents argue that a school that has good, clear laws, fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community, and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws, is a school in which community discipline prevails, and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops, against other schools today, where rules are arbitrary, authority is absolute, punishment is capricious, and [[due process of law]] is unknown.<ref>The Crisis in American Education&nbsp;— An Analysis and a Proposal, [http://www.sudval.com/05_onepersononevote.html#02 The Sudbury Valley School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511180710/http://www.sudval.com/05_onepersononevote.html |date=11 May 2011 }} (1970), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MAqxzEss8k4C&pg=PA49&dq=The+Crisis+in+American+Education+%E2%80%94+An+Analysis+and+a+Proposal,+The+Sudbury+Valley+School+(1970),+Law+and+Order:+Foundations+of+Discipline ''Law and Order: Foundations of Discipline''] (pg. 49-55).

== Occupational hazards ==
{{Main|Occupational hazard}}
Teachers face several occupational hazards in their line of work, including [[occupational stress]], which can negatively impact teachers' mental and physical health, productivity, and students' performance. Stress can be caused by organizational change, relationships with students, fellow teachers, and administrative personnel, working environment, expectations to substitute, long hours with a heavy workload, and inspections. Teachers are also at high risk for [[occupational burnout]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work-related stress in teachers|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2015|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 25851427|pages = CD010306|volume = 4|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010306.pub2|first1 = Ali|last1 = Naghieh|first2 = Paul|last2 = Montgomery|first3 = Christopher P.|last3 = Bonell|first4 = Marc|last4 = Thompson|first5 = J.

A 2000 study found that 42% of UK teachers experienced occupational stress, twice the figure for the average profession. A 2012 study found that teachers experienced double the rate of anxiety, depression, and stress than average workers.<ref name=":0"/>

There are several ways to mitigate the occupational hazards of teaching. Organizational interventions, like changing teachers' schedules, providing support networks and mentoring, changing the work environment, and offering promotions and bonuses, may be effective in helping to reduce occupational stress among teachers. Individual-level interventions, including stress-management training and counseling, are also used to relieve occupational stress among teachers.<ref name=":0"/>

Apart from this, teachers are often not given sufficient opportunities for professional growth or promotions. This leads to some stagnancy, as there is not sufficient interests to enter the profession. An organisation in India called [[Centre for Teacher Accreditation|Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA)]] is working to reduce this hazard, by trying to open opportunities for teachers in India.

==Teaching around the world==
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - 6 24 - School for adults in Guinea-Bissau - 1974.tiff|thumb|Teacher and pupils in liberated [[Guinea-Bissau]], 1974.]]
[[File:Agnar O.P. Strandberg 1964.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Math and physics teacher at a junior college in [[Sweden]], in the 1960s]]
There are many similarities and differences among teachers around the world. In almost all countries teachers are educated in a university or college. Governments may require [[Certified teacher|certification]] by a recognized body before they can teach in a school. In many countries, elementary school education certificate is earned after completion of high school. The high school student follows an education specialty track, obtain the prerequisite "student-teaching" time, and receive a special diploma to begin teaching after graduation. In addition to certification, many educational institutions especially within the US, require that prospective teachers pass a background check and psychiatric evaluation to be able to teach in classroom. This is not always the case with adult further learning institutions but is fast becoming the norm in many countries as security<ref name="Osborne, E. 1999" /> concerns grow.

[[International school]]s generally follow an English-speaking, Western curriculum and are aimed at expatriate communities.<ref name="intschools">{{cite web |last=Teachers International Consultancy |title=Teaching at international schools is not TEFL |date=17 July 2008 |url=http://www.ticrecruitment.com/contentpage.php?pageid=14 |accessdate=2009-01-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209225547/http://www.ticrecruitment.com/contentpage.php?pageid=14 |archive-date=9 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Australia===
{{Main|Education in Australia}}

Education in Australia is primarily the responsibility of the individual [[states and territories of Australia|states and territories]]. Generally, education in Australia follows the three-tier model which includes [[primary education]] (primary schools), followed by [[secondary education]] (secondary schools/high schools) and [[tertiary education]] (universities or [[Technical and further education|TAFE]] colleges).

===Canada===
{{Main|Education in Canada}}

Teaching in [[Canada]] requires a post-secondary degree [[Bachelor's Degree]]. In most provinces a second [[Bachelor's Degree]] such as a [[Bachelor of Education]] is required to become a qualified teacher. Salary ranges from $40,000/year to $90,000/yr. Teachers have the option to teach for a public school which is funded by the provincial government or teaching in a private school which is funded by the private sector, businesses and sponsors.

===France===
{{Main|Education in France}}

In [[France]], teachers, or ''professors'', are mainly civil servants, recruited by [[competitive examination]].

===Germany===
{{Main|Education in Germany}}

In [[Germany]], teachers are mainly civil servants recruited in special university classes, called ''Lehramtstudien'' (''Teaching Education Studies''). There are many differences between the teachers for elementary schools (''Grundschule''), lower secondary schools (''Hauptschule''), middle level secondary schools (''Realschule'') and higher level secondary schools (''Gymnasium'').
Salaries for teachers depend on the civil servants' salary index scale (''Bundesbesoldungsordnung'').

===India===
{{See also|Gurukula|Education in India}}
In ancient India, the most common form of education was [[gurukula]] based on the [[Guru–shishya tradition|guru-shishya tradition]] (teacher-disciple tradition) which involved the disciple and guru living in the same (or a nearby) residence. These ''gurukulam'' was supported by public donations and the guru would not accept any fees from the ''shishya''. This organized system stayed the most prominent form of education in the [[Indian subcontinent]] until the British invasion. Through strong efforts in 1886 and 1948, the gurukula system was revived in India.<ref>Madalsa Ujjwal, 2008, "Swami Dayanand Saraswati Life and Ideas", Book Treasure Publications, Jodhpur, PP.96-97</ref><ref>Joshi, Ankur; Gupta, Rajen K. (July 2017). "Elementary education in Bharat (that is India): insights from a postcolonial ethnographic study of a Gurukul". ''International Journal of Indian Culture and Business Management''.</ref>

The role and success of a teacher in the modern Indian education system is clearly defined. [[Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA)|CENTA]] Standards define the competencies that a good teacher should possess. Schools look for competent teachers across grades. Teachers are appointed directly by schools in private sector, and through eligibility tests in government schools.

===Ireland===
{{Main|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}

Salaries for primary teachers in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] depend mainly on seniority (i.e. holding the position of [[principal (school)|principal]], deputy principal or [[assistant principal]]), experience and qualifications. Extra pay is also given for teaching through the [[Irish language]], in a [[Gaeltacht]] area or on an [[islands of Ireland|island]]. The basic pay for a starting teacher is €27,814 [[Per annum|p.a.]], rising incrementally to €53,423 for a teacher with 25 years service. A principal of a large school with many years experience and several qualifications ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[H.Dip.]], etc.) could earn over €90,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Circular 0040/2011 (New Pay Scales for New Appointees to Teaching in 2011)|url=http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0040_2011.pdf|publisher=Department of Education, Ireland|accessdate=23 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606211440/http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0040_2011.pdf|archive-date=6 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In [[Scotland]], anyone wishing to teach must be registered with the [[General Teaching Council for Scotland]] (GTCS). Teaching in Scotland is an all graduate profession and the normal route for graduates wishing to teach is to complete a programme of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) at one of the seven Scottish Universities who offer these courses. Once successfully completed, "Provisional Registration" is given by the GTCS which is raised to "Full Registration" status after a year if there is sufficient evidence to show that the "Standard for Full Registration" has been met.<ref>[http://www.gtcs.org.uk/Becoming_a_Teacher/Trainingtobeateacher/Trainingtobeateacher.asp Training to be a teacher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129112253/http://www.gtcs.org.uk/Becoming_a_Teacher/Trainingtobeateacher/Trainingtobeateacher.asp |date=29 January 2008 }} GTC Scotland</ref>

Education in Wales differs in certain respects from education elsewhere in the United Kingdom. For example, a significant number of students all over Wales are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of Welsh: in 2008/09, 22 per cent of classes in maintained primary schools used Welsh as the sole or main medium of instruction. Welsh medium education is available to all age groups through nurseries, schools, colleges and universities and in adult education; lessons in the language itself are compulsory for all pupils until the age of 16.

Teachers in [[Wales]] can be registered members of [[trade unions]] such as [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers|ATL]], [[National Union of Teachers|NUT]] or [[NASUWT]] and reports in recent years suggest that the average age of teachers in Wales is falling with teachers being younger than in previous years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8630117.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wales' teachers 'getting younger' | date=20 April 2010}}</ref> A growing cause of concern are that attacks on teachers in Welsh schools which reached an all-time high between 2005 and 2010.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11476605 | work=BBC News | title=Attacks on teachers in Wales on the rise | date=7 October 2010 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123173859/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11476605 | archive-date=23 November 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In the past, teachers have been paid relatively low salaries. However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was [[USD|$]]46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aft.org/earlychildhood/worthy-wage-day-2019/downloads-and-2019-wage-data|title=Downloads and 2019 Wage Data|date=2015-04-16|website=American Federation of Teachers|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/preschool-teachers.htm|title=Preschool Teachers|website=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref><ref name="US Salaries, 2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos069.htm#earnings|title=U.S. Department of Labor: Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations. Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school. Also, with the advent of the internet, many teachers are now selling their lesson plans to other teachers through the web in order to earn supplemental income, most notably on TeachersPayTeachers.com.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hu |first=Winnie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/education/15plans.html?_r=2&hp |title=Selling Lessons Online Raises Cash and Questions |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-31 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512095509/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/education/15plans.html?_r=2&hp |archive-date=12 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 4]] also aims to substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers through international cooperation by 2030 in an effort to improve the quality of teaching around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SDG4’s 10 targets|url=https://www.campaignforeducation.org/en/who-we-are/the-international-education-framework-2/the-sustainable-development-goal-4/sdg4s-10-targets/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=Global Campaign For Education|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Assistant teachers==
Assistant teachers are additional teachers assisting the primary teacher, often in the same classroom.  There are different types around the world, as well as a variety of formal programs defining roles and responsibilities.

One type is a [[Foreign Language Assistant]], which in Germany is run by the Educational Exchange Service ([[:de:Pädagogischer Austauschdienst|Pädagogischer Austauschdienst]]).

British schools employ [[Teaching assistant (United Kingdom)|teaching assistants]], who are not considered fully qualified teachers, and as such, are guided by teachers but may supervise and teach groups of pupils independently. In the United Kingdom, the term "assistant teacher" used to be used to refer to any qualified or unqualified teacher who was not a head or deputy head teacher.{{Original research inline|date=September 2017}}

The Japanese education system employs [[Assistant Language Teacher]]s in elementary, junior high and high schools.

[[Learning by teaching]] ([[German language|German]] short form: LdL) is a method which allows pupils and students to prepare and teach lessons or parts of lessons, with the understanding that a student's own learning is enhanced through the teaching process.
