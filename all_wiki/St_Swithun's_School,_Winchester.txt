'''St Swithun's School''' is an independent day, weekly and full-boarding school for girls in [[Winchester]], Hampshire. It is named after Saint [[Swithun]], a [[Bishop of Winchester]] and patron saint of [[Winchester Cathedral]].

==History==
St Swithun's was founded as "Winchester High School" by Miss Anna Bramston, daughter of [[John Bramston (priest)|John Bramston]], the then [[Dean of Winchester]], with the ambition of educating "daughters of worthy citizens of Winchester". Not having sufficient money of her own, funds were raised by subscription. The school opened on 5 May 1884 with seventeen pupils. Pupil numbers soon grew and the school began taking in boarders as well.

In 1909 the school rented ten acres on Magdalen Hill for sports. The school's name was changed to Winchester Girls' School and then, after [[World War I]], to St Swithun's School: the recorded virtues of this saint – Caritas, Humilitas, Sinceritas – were adopted as the school’s motto in 1928.

St Swithun's moved to its present location overlooking the Hampshire Downs on the edge of [[Winchester]] in 1931. [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary the Princess Royal]] opened the new buildings formally in 1932, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] saw the school turned into a hospital and by 1942 St Swithun's became an American casualty clearing station. The school celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1959 with the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] as a special guest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stswithuns.com/The-School-History|title=StackPath|author=|date=|website=www.stswithuns.com|accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref>

Today, St Swithun's includes both junior and senior schools, meaning pupils can attend from nursery all the way to [[sixth form]] level. Boys may attend up to age 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stswithuns.com/Junior-Home|title=StackPath|author=|date=|website=www.stswithuns.com|accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref> A new junior school building was opened in September 2015 with a further sports hall opening in Easter 2016.

St Swithun's retains a strong [[Anglican]] tradition through its links with [[Winchester Cathedral]]. It holds six services there every year and the girls' choir sings at the cathedral.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stswithuns.com/Our-Links-with-Winchester-Cathedral|title=StackPath|author=|date=|website=www.stswithuns.com|accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref>

==Curriculum==
St Swithun's has traditionally had a strong academic reputation. In 2011 [[GCSE]]s, it topped the results table for the city of [[Winchester]] with a 100% passing rate and all candidates achieving at least 5 A*-C grades, surpassing [[Winchester College]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Secondary Schools (GCSE) in Winchester|url=http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/li/secondary_schools.compare.Winchester/|publisher=[[Hampshire Chronicle]]|year=2011}}</ref> The same year, it broke its records in the [[A Levels]] with 11 girls scoring 3 or more A* grades.<ref>{{cite news|title=St Swithun's A level results 2011|url=http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/education/9206873.St_Swithun___s_School_A_level_results_2011/|publisher=[[Hampshire Chronicle]]|date=19 August 2011}}</ref> Since the year 2000 the school has had 100% pass rate in both GCSEs and A-Levels.

==Boarding==
St Swithun's school offers boarding facilities for girls of any age who enrol in the senior school. Just under half the girls in senior school are boarders and about 70% of them board only on weekdays. Boarders are offered a wide range of co-curricular activities both in after school and weekend programmes and activities. The library and swimming pool are open at specific times during the weekend ensuring that boarders enjoy the school facilities to the fullest.

==Uniform==

The school has a modern winter uniform consisting of a pale blue open necked shirt, orange-trimmed navy pullover and blazer, and a school kilt which is navy and orange. In the summer the girls can optionally wear a school dress. The sports uniform is a navy blue skort and a light blue T-shirt with orange match shirts for lacrosse and netball.

==Facilities==
Sports facilities include 9 lacrosse pitches, 13 tennis courts (1 indoors), 6 netball courts, a 25-meter indoor swimming pool and a multi-purpose sports hall. In 2003, the PAC (Performing Arts Centre) – now "The Harvey Hall" – was opened, and it has a large auditorium to sit over 700, and also includes a Studio Theatre, Green Rooms, Box Office and a smaller SPS (Small Performance Space).

A new library was opened in 2007 by the [[Mayor of Winchester]] Chris Pines and The Very Rev [[James Atwell]], [[Dean of Winchester]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Mayor opens St Swithun's School library|url=http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/news/1894598.Mayor_opens_St_Swithun_s_School_library/|publisher=[[Hampshire Chronicle]]|date=10 December 2007}}</ref>

==Admissions==
As for many other independent schools, candidates for entry to St Swithun's must sit the [[Common Entrance Examination]].

Candidates for academic scholarships are selected based on the results of the Common Entrance examinations (11+ and 13+) and are invited to attend an interview soon after completion of the examination. Sixth form scholarship candidates (16+) are selected based solely on the results of academic assessments in the subjects that they intend to take at A level.

Music scholarships may be awarded each year to suitable applicants at 11+, 13+ and 16+. The minimum [[ABRSM]] standard required for music scholarships is Grade 5 at 11+, Grade 6 at 13+ and Grade 7 at 16+ on two instruments.

Girls can also apply for a sports scholarship, where they should be county level at two or more sports.

==Former pupils==
Alumnae are known as "Old Swithunites".
