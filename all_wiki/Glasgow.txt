[[Shires of Scotland|Historically]] part of [[Lanarkshire]], the city now forms the Glasgow City council area, one of the 32 [[council areas of Scotland]]; the local authority is [[Glasgow City Council]]. Glasgow is situated on the [[River Clyde]] in the country's [[Scottish Lowlands|West Central Lowlands]]. It is the fifth most visited city in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/popular-uk-cities-for-international-visitors-1661845 | title=Top 20 Most Popular Cities in the UK for International Visitors | access-date=9 July 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709150510/https://www.tripsavvy.com/popular-uk-cities-for-international-visitors-1661845 | archive-date=9 July 2019 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Inhabitants of the city are referred to as "Glaswegians" or, in the pejorative, as "Weegies". Glasgow is also known for the [[Glasgow patter]], a distinct dialect of the [[Scots language]] that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city.

Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain. Expanding from the [[medieval]] [[Archbishop of Glasgow|bishopric]] and [[royal burgh]], and the later establishment of the [[University of Glasgow]] in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] in the 18th century. From the 18th century onwards, the city also grew as one of Great Britain's main hubs of transatlantic trade with [[British America|North America]] and the [[British West Indies|West Indies]].

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the [[shipbuilding]] and [[Naval architecture|marine engineering]] industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. Glasgow was the "Second City of the British Empire" for much of the [[Victorian era]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian period]], having taken the mantle from pre-independence [[Dublin]], which was largely recognised the second city during the [[Georgian era]] although [[Second city of the United Kingdom|many other cities argue the title was theirs, not Glasgow's]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/victorian/trails_victorian_glasgow.shtml|title=Victorian Glasgow|accessdate=14 September 2010|publisher=BBC History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514172952/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/victorian/trails_victorian_glasgow.shtml|archive-date=14 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/History/The+Second+City.htm |title=About Glasgow: The Second City of the Empire&nbsp;— the 19th century |accessdate=9 July 2007 |publisher=Glasgow City Council |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402171109/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/History/The%2BSecond%2BCity.htm |archivedate=2 April 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=W, H |url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyd.php |title=Second City of The Empire: 1830s to 1914 |accessdate=7 January 2008 |publisher=University of Glasgow |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105124204/http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyd.php |archive-date=5 January 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=McIlvanney |first=W |url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/vibrant6-glasgow.html |title=Glasgow&nbsp;– city of reality |accessdate=7 January 2008 |publisher=Scotland&nbsp;– the official online gateway |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204064459/http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/vibrant6-glasgow.html |archive-date=4 December 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/E3BE21DA-4D84-4CC4-9C02-2E526FDD9169/0/4population.pdf |title=Factsheet 4: Population |publisher=Glasgow City Council |accessdate=9 July 2007 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703130648/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/E3BE21DA-4D84-4CC4-9C02-2E526FDD9169/0/4population.pdf |archivedate=3 July 2007}}</ref> Comprehensive [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated [[new town]]s, such as [[Cumbernauld]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]], [[East Kilbride]] and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes. This process reduced the population of the City of Glasgow council area to an estimated 633,120, with 985,290 people living in the defined [[Greater Glasgow]] contiguous urban area as of 2016.<ref name="NRS"/> The wider [[Glasgow City Region|metropolitan area]] is home to over 1,800,000 people, equating to around 33% of Scotland's population. The city has one of the highest densities of any [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population#Localities|locality]] in Scotland at 4,023/km<sup>2</sup>.

Glasgow hosted the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] and the first [[European Championships (multi-sport event)|European Championships]] in 2018; and is also well known in the sporting world for football (particularly the [[Old Firm]] rivalry between [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]), rugby, athletics, tennis, golf and swimming.

Today, Glasgow has a diverse architectural scene, one of the key factors leading visitors to the city. From the city centre sprawling with grand Victorian buildings, to the many glass and metal edifices in the [[International Financial Services District]] to the serpentine terraces of blonde and red sandstone in the fashionable west end and the imposing mansions which make up [[Pollokshields]], on the south side. The banks of the [[River Clyde]] are also dotted with a plethora of futuristic-looking buildings which include [[Riverside Museum]], [[Glasgow Science Centre]], the [[SSE Hydro]] and the [[SEC Armadillo]].

==Etymology==
The name Glasgow is [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] in origin, with a first element being ''glas'', meaning "grey-green, grey-blue", and the second ''*cöü'', "hollow" (c.f. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''glas-cau''),<ref name="bliton">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Alan |title=A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence |url=https://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary_2019_Edition.pdf |website=SPNS – The Brittonic Language in the Old North |accessdate=13 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307061257/https://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary_2019_Edition.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> giving a meaning of "green-hollow".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://glaschu.net/placenames-project-university-of-glasgow/|title=Glaschu|last=|first=|date=|website=Glaschu|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801031412/https://glaschu.net/placenames-project-university-of-glasgow/|archivedate=1 August 2020|accessdate=30 April 2020}}</ref>  The green-hollow may refer to the ravine to the east of Glasgow Cathedral. It is sometimes mistakenly{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} claimed that the name means "dear green place" when translated from Gaelic.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018|title=Our Dear Green Place|url=https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=42440&p=0|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=glasgow.gov.uk|publisher=Glasgow City Council}}</ref>

The settlement probably had an earlier Cumbric name, '''Cathures'''; the modern name appears for the first time in the Gaelic period (1116), as ''Glasgu''. It is also recorded that the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|King of Strathclyde]], [[Rhydderch Hael]], welcomed Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), and procured his consecration as bishop about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the [[Molendinar Burn]] where [[Glasgow Cathedral]] now stands, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as ''Glasgu''.

==History==
{{Main|History of Glasgow}}

===Origins and development===
The area around Glasgow has hosted communities for millennia, with the [[River Clyde]] providing a natural location for fishing. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] later built outposts in the area and, to keep Roman [[Britannia]] separate from the [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Picts|Pictish]] [[Caledonia]], constructed the [[Antonine Wall]]. Items from the wall, such as altars from [[Castra|Roman forts]] like [[Balmuildy]], can be found at the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] today.

Glasgow itself was reputed to have been founded by the Christian [[missionary]] [[Saint Mungo]] in the 6th century. He established a church on the [[Molendinar Burn]], where the present [[Glasgow Cathedral]] stands, and in the following years Glasgow became a religious centre.
Glasgow grew over the following centuries. The [[Glasgow Fair]] reportedly began in the year 1190.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lindsay|first1=Sir John|title=The City of Glasgow : its origin, growth and development ; with maps and plates|date=1921|publisher=Royal Scottish Geographical Society|location=Edinburgh|page=26|url=https://archive.org/stream/cityofglasgowits00newb#page/26/mode/2up/search/1190|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref> The [[Lowest bridging point|first bridge]] over the River Clyde at Glasgow was recorded from around 1285, giving its name to the Briggait area of the city, forming the main north–south route over the river via [[Glasgow Cross]]. The founding of the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1451 and elevation of the [[Diocese|bishopric]] to become the [[Archdiocese of Glasgow]] in 1492 increased the town's religious and educational status and landed wealth. Its early trade was in agriculture, brewing and fishing, with cured salmon and herring being exported to Europe and the Mediterranean.<ref name="ReferenceA">The City of Glasgow – The Third Statistical Account of Scotland, published 1958</ref>

Following the European Protestant [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] and with the encouragement of the [[Convention of Royal Burghs]], the 14 incorporated trade crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the town council of the earlier Merchants' Guilds who established their [[Merchants House]] in the same year.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of [[Royal Burgh]] in 1611. Glasgow's substantial fortunes came from international trade, manufacturing and invention, starting in the 17th century with sugar, followed by tobacco, and then cotton and linen, products of the [[Triangular trade|Atlantic triangular slave trade]].

[[Daniel Defoe]] visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book ''[[A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain]]'', that Glasgow was "the cleanest and beautifullest, and best built city in Britain, London excepted". At that time the city's population was about 12,000, and the city was yet to undergo the massive expansionary changes to its economy and urban fabric, brought about by the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and Industrial Revolution.

===Trading port===
After the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707, Scotland gained further access to the vast markets of the new British Empire, and Glasgow became prominent as a hub of international trade to and from the Americas, especially in sugar, tobacco, cotton, and manufactured goods. The city's ''[[Tobacco Lords]]'' created a deep water port at [[Port Glasgow]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]], as the river within the city itself was then too shallow.<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ Abolition of the Slave Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172434/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ |date=3 January 2012 }}. [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]] Online. Retrieved 26 September 2007</ref> By the late 18th century more than half of the British tobacco trade was concentrated on Glasgow's River Clyde, with over {{convert|47000000|lb|tonnes|abbr=on}} of tobacco being imported each year at its peak.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSCE03 |title=The Glasgow Story: Industry and Technology&nbsp;— Food, Drink and Tobacco |publisher=[[The Glasgow Story]] |year=2004 |accessdate=29 July 2008 |first=Ian |last=Donnachie |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206081206/http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSCE03 |archive-date=6 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the time, Glasgow held a commercial importance as the city participated in the trade of sugar, tobacco and later cotton.<ref>Harris, Nathaniel (2000).

===Industrialisation===
[[File:John Atkinson Grimshaw - Shipping on the Clyde (1881).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|''Shipping on the Clyde'', [[John Atkinson Grimshaw|Atkinson Grimshaw]], 1881]]
The opening of the [[Monkland Canal]] and basin linking to the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] at [[Port Dundas]] in 1795, facilitated access to the extensive iron-ore and coal mines in [[Lanarkshire]]. After extensive [[river engineering]] projects to dredge and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow, shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river, pioneered by industrialists such as [[Robert Napier (engineer)|Robert Napier]], [[John Elder (shipbuilder)|John Elder]], [[George Thomson (shipbuilder)|George Thomson]], [[Sir William Pearce, 1st Baronet|Sir William Pearce]] and [[Alfred Yarrow|Sir Alfred Yarrow]].

The River Clyde also became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as [[John Atkinson Grimshaw]], [[John Knox (artist)|John Knox]], [[James Kay (artist)|James Kay]], [[Sir Muirhead Bone]], [[Robert Eadie]], [[Stanley Spencer]] and [[L.S. Lowry]], willing to depict the new industrial era and the modern world.

Glasgow's population had surpassed that of Edinburgh by 1821. The development of civic institutions included the [[City of Glasgow Police]] in 1800, one of the first municipal [[police]] forces in the world. Despite the crisis caused by the [[City of Glasgow Bank]]'s collapse in 1878, growth continued and by the end of the 19th century it was one of the cities known as the "Second City of the Empire" and was producing more than half Britain's tonnage of shipping<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyd.php |title=Second City of The Empire: 1830s to 1914 |publisher=The Glasgow Story |year=2004 |accessdate=9 July 2008 |first=W.

Shipping, banking, insurance and professional services expanded at the same time.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Glasgow became one of the first cities in Europe to reach a population of one million. The city's new trades and sciences attracted new residents from across the [[Lowlands of Scotland|Lowlands]] and the [[Highlands of Scotland]], from [[Ireland]] and other parts of Britain and from [[Continental Europe]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

During this period, the construction of many of the city's greatest architectural masterpieces and most ambitious civil engineering projects, such as the [[Milngavie water treatment works]], [[Glasgow Subway]], [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways]], [[Glasgow City Chambers|City Chambers]], [[Mitchell Library]] and [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] were being funded by its wealth. The city also held a series of [[List of world's fairs|International Exhibitions]] at [[Kelvingrove Park]], in [[International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry|1888]], [[Glasgow International Exhibition (1901)|1901]] and [[Scottish Exhibition of National History, Art and Industry|1911]], with Britain's last major International Exhibition, the [[Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938|Empire Exhibition]], being subsequently held in 1938 at [[Bellahouston Park]], which drew 13 million visitors.<ref>Glasgow's Great Exhibitions by Perilla Kinchin and others, published 1988</ref>

[[File:1960s Glasgow - geograph.org.uk - 878125.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|George Square in 1966]]
The 20th century witnessed both decline and renewal in the city. After [[World War I]], the city suffered from the impact of the [[Post–World War I recession]] and from the later [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], this also led to a rise of radical socialism and the "[[Red Clydeside]]" movement.

By the 1960s, growth of industry in countries like Japan and [[West Germany]], weakened the once pre-eminent position of many of the city's industries.

As a result of this, Glasgow entered a lengthy period of relative economic decline and rapid de-industrialisation, leading to high unemployment, urban decay, population decline, [[welfare dependency]] and poor health for the city's inhabitants. There were active attempts at regeneration of the city, when the Glasgow Corporation published its controversial ''[[Bruce Report]]'', which set out a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at turning round the decline of the city. The report led to a huge and radical programme of rebuilding and regeneration efforts that started in the mid-1950s and lasted into the late 1970s. This involved the mass demolition of the city's infamous slums and their replacement with large suburban housing estates and tower blocks.<ref name="Staples">{{cite web |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=986122002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050119043309/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=986122002 |archivedate=19 January 2005 |title=Secret plot to strip Glasgow of influence |website=The Scotsman |location=UK |date=5 September 2002 |accessdate=11 December 2007 |first=John |last=Staples}}</ref>

The city invested heavily in roads infrastructure, with an extensive system of arterial roads and motorways that bisected the central area. There are also accusations that the [[Scottish Office]] had deliberately attempted to undermine Glasgow's economic and political influence in post-war Scotland by diverting inward investment in new industries to other regions during the [[Silicon Glen]] boom and creating the [[New towns#United Kingdom|new towns]] of Cumbernauld, Glenrothes, Irvine, Livingston and [[East Kilbride]], dispersed across the [[Scottish Lowlands]] to halve the city's population base.<ref name="Staples"/>

By the late 1980s, there had been a significant resurgence in Glasgow's economic fortunes. The "[[Glasgow's miles better]]" campaign, launched in 1983, and opening of the [[Burrell Collection]] in 1983 and [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]] in 1985 facilitated Glasgow's new role as a European centre for business services and finance and promoted an increase in tourism and inward investment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7468870.stm |title=Why Glasgow was 'miles better' |work=BBC News |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=30 July 2008 |first=Reevel |last=Alderson}}</ref> The latter continues to be bolstered by the legacy of the city's [[Glasgow Garden Festival]] in 1988, its status as [[European City of Culture]] in 1990, and concerted attempts to diversify the city's economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openscotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/27153210/10 |title=Interim Evaluation of the Cities Growth Fund: A Report to the Scottish Executive&nbsp;— Appendix 4: Glasgow |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=March 2007 |accessdate=26 June 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302023804/http://openscotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/27153210/10 |archivedate=2 March 2012}}</ref> However, it is the industrial heritage that serves as key tourism enabler.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Richard|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin D.|date=1 September 2013|title=Pro-Poor Tourism in a First World Urban Setting: Case Study of Glasgow Govan|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|volume=15|issue=5|pages=443–457|doi=10.1002/jtr.1888|issn=1522-1970}}</ref> Wider economic revival has persisted and the ongoing [[Urban renewal|regeneration]] of inner-city areas, including the large-scale [[Clyde Waterfront Regeneration]], has led to more affluent people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow, fuelling allegations of [[gentrification]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_41198_en.pdf |title=Housing regeneration in Glasgow: Gentrification and upward neighbourhood trajectories in a post-industrial city |publisher=eSharp |year=2006 |accessdate=10 July 2008 |first=Zhan |last=McIntyre |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910115209/http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_41198_en.pdf |archive-date=10 September 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2008, the city was listed by [[Lonely Planet]] as one of the world's top 10 tourist cities.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/oct/15/glasgow-scotland |title=Lonely Planet guide rates Glasgow as one of the world's top 10 cities |accessdate=15 October 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Severin |last=Carrell |date=15 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119015641/http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/oct/15/glasgow-scotland |archive-date=19 January 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Sanitation===
With the population growing, the first scheme to provide a public water supply was by the Glasgow Company in 1806.

Good health requires both clean water and effective removal of sewage. The [[Caledonian Railway]] rebuilt many of the sewers, as part of a deal to allow them to tunnel under the city, and sewage treatment works were opened at Dalmarnoch in 1894, Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910.

The [[coat of arms]] of the City of Glasgow was granted to the [[royal burgh]] by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms|Lord Lyon]] on 25 October 1866.<ref>Urquhart, R.M. (1973) ''Scottish Burgh and County Heraldry''. London. Heraldry Today. {{ISBN|978-0-900455-24-7}}.</ref> It incorporates a number of symbols and emblems associated with the life of Glasgow's patron saint, Mungo, which had been used on official seals prior to that date. The emblems represent [[Saint Mungo#Miracles|miracles]] supposed to have been performed by Mungo<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=17325|title=The City Crest|last=Glasgow Young Scot|first=20 Trongate|date=3 November 2015|accessdate=23 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923235309/https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=17325|archive-date=23 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and are listed in the traditional rhyme:
::::''Here's the bird that never flew''
::::''Here's the tree that never grew''
::::''Here's the bell that never rang''
::::''Here's the fish that never swam''

St Mungo is also said to have preached a sermon containing the words ''Lord, Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of thy name''. This was abbreviated to "Let Glasgow Flourish" and adopted as the city's motto.

In 1450, John Stewart, the first [[Lord Provost]] of Glasgow, left an endowment so that a "St Mungo's Bell" could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his soul. A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] Museum, near [[Glasgow Green]].

The supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the crest is a half length figure of Saint Mungo. He wears a bishop's mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in "the act of [[benediction]]". The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm, but this was removed in subsequent grants. The current version (1996) has a gold [[mural crown]] between the shield and the crest. This form of coronet, resembling an embattled city wall, was allowed to the four area councils with city status.

The arms were re-matriculated by the City of [[Glasgow District Council]] on 6 February 1975, and by the present area council on 25 March 1996. The only change made on each occasion was in the type of coronet over the arms.<ref>Urquhart, R.M. (1979). ''Scottish Civic Heraldry''. London.

==Government and politics==
{{main|Politics of Glasgow}}

===Local government===
{{See also|Glasgow City Council}}
[[File:Glasgow-George-Square.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Glasgow City Chambers, located on [[George Square]], is the headquarters of Glasgow City Council and the seat of local government in the city, circa 1900.]]
Although Glasgow [[Municipal corporation|Corporation]] had been a pioneer in the [[Municipal socialism|municipal socialist]] movement from the late-nineteenth century, since the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], Glasgow increasingly supported [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideas and politics at a national level. The [[Politics of Glasgow|city council]] was controlled by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for over thirty years, since the decline of the [[Progressives (Scotland)|Progressives]]. Since 2007, when local government elections in Scotland began to use the [[single transferable vote]] rather than the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]], the dominance of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] within the city started to decline. As a result of the [[2017 United Kingdom local elections]], the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] was able to form a minority administration ending Labour's thirty-seven years of uninterrupted control.

In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]], the city's frequent strikes and militant organisations caused serious alarm at [[Her Majesty's Government|Westminster]], with one [[Battle of George Square|uprising in January 1919]] prompting the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Lloyd George]], to deploy 10,000 soldiers and tanks on the city's streets. A [[Battle of George Square|huge demonstration]] in the city's [[George Square]] on 31 January ended in violence after the [[Riot Act]] was read.

[[Industrial action]] at the shipyards gave rise to the "[[Red Clydeside]]" epithet. During the 1930s, Glasgow was the main base of the [[Independent Labour Party]]. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became a centre of the struggle against the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]; which was introduced in Scotland a whole year before the rest of the United Kingdom and also served as the main base of the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], another left-wing political party in Scotland. The city has not had a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP since the [[1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election|1982 Hillhead by-election]], when the [[Social Democratic Party|SDP]] took the seat, which was in Glasgow's most affluent area. The fortunes of the Conservative Party continued to decline into the twenty-first century, winning only one of the 79 councillors on Glasgow City Council in 2012, despite having been the controlling party (as the [[Progressives (Scotland)|Progressives]]) from 1969 to 1972 when Sir Donald Liddle was the last non-Labour [[Lord Provost of Glasgow|Lord Provost]].

Glasgow is represented in both the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in [[London]], and the [[Scottish Parliament]] in Holyrood, [[Edinburgh]]. At Westminster, it is represented by seven members of parliament (MPs), all elected at least once every five years to represent individual constituencies, using the first-past-the-post system of voting. In Holyrood, Glasgow is represented by sixteen MSPs, of whom nine are elected to represent individual constituencies once every four years using first-past-the-post, and seven are elected as additional regional members, by proportional representation. Since the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], Glasgow is represented at Holyrood by
9 [[Scottish National Party]] MSPs, 4 [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] MSPs, 2 [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative]] MSPs and 1 [[Scottish Green Party|Scottish Green]] MSP. In the European Parliament, the city forms part of the Scotland constituency, which elects six Members of the European Parliament.

===Central government===
{{Main|Glasgow Parliamentary Constituencies}} 
{{See also|Glasgow Scottish Parliament region|United Kingdom constituencies}}
Since Glasgow is covered and operates under two separate central governments, the devolved Scottish Parliament and UK Government, they determine various matters that Glasgow City Council is not responsible for.

====Scottish Parliament====
The [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow electoral region of the Scottish Parliament]] covers the Glasgow City council area, the [[Rutherglen]] area of the [[South Lanarkshire]] and a small eastern portion of [[Renfrewshire]]. It elects nine of the parliament's 73 [[first past the post]] constituency members and seven of the 56 [[Mixed member proportional representation|additional members]]. Both kinds of member are known as [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs)]]. The system of election is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]].

The first past the post seats were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of then existing [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] ([[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]) constituencies. In 2005, the number of Westminster [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament (MPs)]] representing Scotland was cut to 59, with new constituencies being formed, while the existing number of [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] was retained at Holyrood. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the boundaries of the Glasgow region were redrawn.

Currently, the nine Scottish Parliament constituencies in the Glasgow electoral region are:
* [[Glasgow Anniesland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]]
* [[Glasgow Cathcart (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Cathcart]]
* [[Glasgow Kelvin (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Kelvin]]
* [[Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn]]
* [[Glasgow Pollok (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Pollok]]
* [[Glasgow Provan (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Provan]]
* [[Glasgow Shettleston (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Shettleston]]
* [[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]]
* [[Rutherglen (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Rutherglen]]

At the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], all nine of these constituencies were won by [[Scottish National Party]] MSPs. On the regional vote, the Glasgow electoral region is represented by four [[Scottish Labour|Labour]] MSPs, two [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative]] MSPs and one [[Scottish Green Party|Green]] MSP.

====UK Westminster Parliament====
Following reform of constituencies of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] ([[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]) in 2005, which reduced the number of Scottish [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament (MPs)]], the current Westminster constituencies representing Glasgow are:
* [[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]]
* [[Glasgow East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow East]]
* [[Glasgow North (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North]]
* [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]]
* [[Glasgow North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North West]]
* [[Glasgow South (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow South]]
* [[Glasgow South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow South West]]

Following the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]], in which 53.49% of the electorate of Glasgow voted in favour of Scottish independence; the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] won every constituency in the city at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], including a record-breaking 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP in the seat of [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|title=Election 2015: SNP wins 56 of 59 seats in Scots landslide|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521003643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|archive-date=21 May 2015|url-status=live|date=8 May 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref>

In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 snap election]], Glasgow was represented by 6 Scottish National Party MPs and 1 Labour MP; the Glasgow North East constituency which had a record 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP at the previous general election, was regained by [[Paul Sweeney]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who narrowly defeated sitting SNP MP [[Anne McLaughlin]] by 242 votes.

Since the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 snap election]], Glasgow has been represented by 7 Scottish National Party MPs; the Glasgow North East constituency, was regained by [[Anne McLaughlin]] of the [[Scottish National Party]], resulting in the same clean sweep as in [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].

====Referendums====
In the [[Scottish independence referendum]], Glasgow voted "Yes" by a margin of [[2014 Scottish independence referendum#By area|53.5% to 46.5%]].

In the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|Brexit referendum]], results varied from constituency to constituency. Glasgow North recorded the biggest remain vote with 78% opting to stay in the EU whilst in Glasgow East this figure dropped to 56%.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/14583516.display/ |title=EU referendum: Here is how Glasgow voted |newspaper=The Evening Times |date=28 June 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829082354/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/14583516.display/ |archive-date=29 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city as a whole voted to remain in the EU, by 66.6% to 33.3%.<ref>[https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=19666 European Referendum 2016 Glasgow Results] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033021/https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=19666 |date=1 December 2017 }} (retrieved 29 November 2017)</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Glasgow}}
Glasgow is located on the banks of the River Clyde, in [[Strathclyde|West Central]] Scotland. Its second most important river is the [[River Kelvin|Kelvin]] whose name was used in creating the title of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Baron Kelvin]] and thereby ended up as the [[Kelvin|SI unit of temperature]].
On older maps Glasgow is shown within the area of the pre-1975 county of [[Lanarkshire]]; from 1975 to 1996 it appears within [[Strathclyde Region]]; more recent maps generally show Glasgow as one of 32 [[Subdivisions of Scotland|Council Areas]] in Scotland.

Glasgow is located in the central belt of Scotland.

===Climate===
Despite its northerly latitude, similar to that of [[Moscow]], Glasgow's climate is classified as [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'').
Data is available online for 3 official weather stations in the Glasgow area: Paisley, Abbotsinch and Bishopton. All are located to the west of the city, in neighbouring Renfrewshire.
Owing to its westerly position and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glasgow is one of Scotland's milder areas. Winter temperatures are usually higher than in most places of equal latitude away from the UK, due to the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]]. However, this results in less distinct seasons as compared to continental Western Europe. At [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], the annual precipitation averages {{convert|1245|mm|1}}. Glasgow has been named as the rainiest city of the UK, having an average of 170 days of rain a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/glasgow-named-britains-rainiest-city-14510570|title=Glasgow named as Britain's rainiest city|first=Jennifer|last=Russell|date=9 April 2018|website=glasgowlive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/britains-rainiest-cities-revealed-good-news-for-londoners-9803812.html|title=Britain's rainiest cities revealed – and it's good news for Londoners|date=18 October 2014|website=The Independent|access-date=5 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605114210/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/britains-rainiest-cities-revealed-good-news-for-londoners-9803812.html|archive-date=5 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Left of centre can be seen the [[Clyde Arc]] bridge at Finnieston, while beyond is the tower of the [[University of Glasgow]], with the [[Campsie Fells]] in the distance on the right.]]

Winters are cool and overcast, with a January mean of {{convert|5.0|°C|1}}, though lows sometimes fall below freezing. Since 2000 Glasgow has experienced few very cold, snowy and harsh winters where temperatures have fallen much below freezing. The most extreme instances have however seen temperatures around {{convert|-12|°C}} in the area. Snowfall accumulation is infrequent and short-lived. The spring months (March to May) are usually mild and often quite pleasant. Many of Glasgow's trees and plants begin to flower at this time of the year and parks and gardens are filled with spring colours.

During the summer months (June to August) the weather can vary considerably from day to day, ranging from relatively cool and wet to quite warm with the odd sunny day. Long dry spells of warm weather are generally quite scarce. Overcast and humid conditions without rain are frequent. Generally the weather pattern is quite unsettled and erratic during these months, with only occasional heatwaves. The warmest month is usually July, with average highs above {{convert|20|°C}}. Summer days can occasionally reach up to 27&nbsp;°C (81&nbsp;°F), and very rarely exceed 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F). Autumns are generally cool to mild with increasing precipitation. During early autumn there can be some settled periods of weather and it can feel pleasant with mild temperatures and some sunny days.

The official Met Office data series goes back to 1959 and shows that there only have been a few warm and no hot summers in Glasgow, in stark contrast to areas further south in Great Britain and eastwards in Europe. The warmest month on record in the data series is July 2006, with an average high of {{convert|22.7|C|F}} and low of {{convert|13.7|C|F}}.<ref name="Climate Station Data for Paisley">{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/stationdata/paisleydata.txt|title=Climate Station Data for Paisley|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=28 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102104129/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/stationdata/paisleydata.txt|archive-date=2 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Even this extreme event only matched a normal summer on similar parallels in continental Europe, underlining the maritime influences. The coldest month on record since the data series began is December 2010, during a severe [[Winter of 2010–11 in Great Britain and Ireland|cold wave]] affecting the British Isles. Even then, the December high was above freezing at {{convert|1.6|C|F}} with the low of {{convert|-4.4|C|F}}.<ref name="Climate Station Data for Paisley"/> This still ensured Glasgow's coldest month of 2010 remained milder than the isotherm of {{convert|-3|C|F}} normally used to determine continental climate normals.

Temperature extremes have ranged from {{convert|−19.9|°C|0}}, at Abbotsinch in December 1995 to<ref>{{cite web

{{further|Glasgow effect}}
In the 1950s, the population of the City of Glasgow area peaked at 1,089,000. Glasgow was then one of the most densely populated cities in the world. After the 1960s, clearances of poverty-stricken inner city areas like the [[Gorbals]] and relocation to "[[New town#United Kingdom|new towns]]" such as [[East Kilbride]] and [[Cumbernauld]] led to population decline. In addition, the boundaries of the city were changed twice during the late-twentieth century, making direct comparisons difficult.

The urban area continues to expand beyond the city council boundaries into surrounding suburban areas, encompassing around {{convert|400|sqmi|km2|-1}} of all adjoining suburbs, if [[commuter town]]s and villages are included.<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/agglo/ United Kingdom: Agglomerations], CityPopulation.de</ref> There are two distinct definitions for the population of Glasgow: the '''Glasgow City Council Area''' which lost the districts of [[Rutherglen]] and [[Cambuslang]] to [[South Lanarkshire]] in 1996, and the '''[[Greater Glasgow]] Urban Area''' which includes the conurbation around the city (however in the 2016 definitions<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/cities/ua/ United Kingdom: Countries and Major Urban Areas], CityPopulation.de</ref> the aforementioned Rutherglen and Cambuslang were included along with the likes of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], [[Clydebank]], [[Newton Mearns]], [[Bearsden]] and [[Stepps]] but not others with no continuity of populated postcodes – although in some cases the gap is small – the excluded nearby settlements including [[Barrhead]], [[Erskine]] and [[Kirkintilloch]] plus a large swathe of Lanarkshire which had been considered contiguous with Glasgow in previous definitions: the '[[List of cities and towns in Scotland|settlements]]' named Coatbridge & Airdrie, Hamilton and Motherwell & Wishaw, each containing a number of distinct smaller localities).<ref name="NRS"/>

Glasgow's population influx in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was related to economic expansion as well as internally generated growth with the vast majority of newcomers to the city from outside Scotland being from [[Ireland]], especially the north western counties of [[County Donegal|Donegal]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] and [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]]. In the 1881 UK Census, 83% of the population was born in Scotland, 13% in Ireland, 3% in England and 1% elsewhere. By 1911, the city was no longer gaining population by migration. The demographic percentages in the 1951 UK census were: born in Scotland 93%, Ireland 3%, England 3% and elsewhere 1%.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In the early twentieth century, many [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] refugees began to settle in Glasgow and at its height in the 1950s; there were around 10,000 in the Glasgow area.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1692714,00.html|title=Lithuanians in Glasgow|date=23 January 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 July 2007 |location=London}}</ref> Many [[Italian Scots]] also settled in Glasgow, originating from provinces like [[Frosinone]] in [[Lazio]] and [[Lucca]] in north-west [[Tuscany]] at this time, many originally working as "[[Hokey pokey (ice cream)|Hokey Pokey]]" men.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gray |first1=Alastair |last2=Moffat |first2=William |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGhvmMCbQLUC&pg=PA39|title=A History of Scotland |chapter=Departures and Arrivals |accessdate=9 July 2007 |page=39 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1989 |edition=Rev |origyear=1985 |isbn=978-0-19-917063-0}}</ref>

===Areas and suburbs===
[[File:Glasgowareas.jpg|thumb|centre|upright=1.30|[[Areas of Glasgow]]. Click to enlarge.]]

===City centre===
The [[Glasgow city centre|city centre]] is bounded by Saltmarket, High Street and Castle Street to the east, Broomielaw and Clyde Street (along the River Clyde) to the south and Newton Street to the west.  The northern boundary (from east to west) follows Cathedral Street, North Hanover Street, Dobbie's Loan and Phoenix Road.  The city centre is composed of the areas of [[Garnethill]], [[Blythswood Hill]], and [[Merchant City]] as well as parts of [[Anderston]], [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]], [[Cowcaddens]] and [[Townhead]].

====Retail and theatre district====

[[File:(looking down) Buchanan Street, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Looking down [[Buchanan Street]] towards [[St Enoch subway station]]]]
The city centre is based on a [[grid plan|grid system]] of streets on the north bank of the River Clyde. The heart of the city is [[George Square]], site of many of [[Public statues in Glasgow|Glasgow's public statues]] and the elaborate Victorian [[Glasgow City Chambers]], headquarters of [[Politics of Glasgow|Glasgow City Council]]. To the south and west are the shopping precincts of [[Argyle Street, Glasgow|Argyle Street]], [[Sauchiehall Street]] and [[Buchanan Street]], the last featuring more upmarket retailers and winner of the Academy of Urbanism "Great Street Award" 2008.<ref>The Academy of Urbanism : Awards https://web.archive.org/web/20080119212642/http://www.academyofurbanism.org.uk/awards.htm.

The city centre is home to most of Glasgow's main cultural venues: the [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]], [[Glasgow City Hall]], [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]] (performing home of [[Scottish Opera]] and [[Scottish Ballet]]), the [[Pavilion Theatre (Glasgow)|Pavilion Theatre]], the [[King's Theatre, Glasgow|King's Theatre]], [[Glasgow Film Theatre]], [[Tron Theatre]], [[Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow|Gallery of Modern Art]] (GoMA), Mitchell Library and Theatre, the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]], [[McLellan Galleries]] and the [[The Lighthouse (Glasgow)|Lighthouse Museum of Architecture]]. [[Cineworld (Glasgow)|The world's tallest cinema]], the eighteen-screen [[Cineworld]], is situated on Renfrew Street.
The city centre is also home to four of Glasgow's higher education institutions: the [[University of Strathclyde]], the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]], [[Glasgow School of Art]] and [[Glasgow Caledonian University]], and to the largest college in Britain the [[City of Glasgow College]] in Cathedral Street.

====Merchant City====
[[File:Glasgow Tolbooth Steeple, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Tolbooth Steeple dominates [[Glasgow Cross]] and marks the east side of the [[Merchant City]].]]
To the east is the commercial and residential district of [[Merchant City]]. The Merchant City was formerly the residential district of the wealthy city merchants in the 18th and early 19th centuries, particularly the [[Tobacco Lords]] from whom many of the streets take their name. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the wealth it brought to the city resulted in the expansion of Glasgow's central area westward, the original medieval centre was left behind. Glasgow Cross, situated at the junction of [[High Street (Glasgow)|High Street]], Gallowgate, [[Trongate]] and Saltmarket was the original centre of the city, symbolised by its [[Mercat cross]]. Glasgow Cross encompasses the [[Tolbooth]] Clock Tower; all that remains of the original City Chambers, which was destroyed by fire in 1926. Moving northward up High Street towards [[Rottenrow]] and [[Townhead]] lies the 15th century [[Glasgow Cathedral]] and the [[Provand's Lordship]]. Due to growing industrial pollution levels in the mid-to-late 19th century, the area fell out of favour with residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowmerchantcity.net/history1.htm |title=Glasgow's Merchant City: Historical Development |publisher=Merchant City Initiative |year=2008 |accessdate=29 July 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513203125/http://www.glasgowmerchantcity.net/history1.htm |archivedate=13 May 2008}}</ref>

From the late 1980s onwards, the Merchant City has been rejuvenated with luxury city centre flats and [[warehouse conversion]]s. This regeneration has supported an increasing number of cafés and restaurants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/4 |title=Merchant City Glasgow: Restaurants and Cafés |publisher=Merchant City Glasgow&nbsp;– Merchant City Initiative |year=2008 |accessdate=30 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616150025/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/4 |archivedate=16 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The area is also home to a number of high end boutique style shops and some of Glasgow's most upmarket stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/7 |title=Merchant City Glasgow: Shops |publisher=Merchant City Glasgow&nbsp;– Merchant City Initiative |year=2008 |accessdate=30 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616150040/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/7 |archivedate=16 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Merchant City is the centre of Glasgow's growing "cultural quarter", based on King Street, the Saltmarket and [[Trongate]], and at the heart of the annual [[Merchant City Festival]]. The area has supported a huge growth in art galleries, the origins of which can be found in the late 1980s when it attracted artist-led organisations that could afford the cheap rents required to operate in vacant manufacturing or retail spaces.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/2 |title=Merchant City Glasgow: Galleries and Art |publisher=Merchant City Glasgow&nbsp;– Merchant City Initiative |year=2008 |accessdate=30 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616150015/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/2 |archivedate=16 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The artistic and cultural potential of the Merchant City as a "cultural quarter" was harnessed by independent arts organisations and [[Glasgow City Council]],<ref name=autogenerated4/> and the recent development of Trongate 103, which houses galleries, workshops, artist studios and production spaces, is considered a major outcome of the continued partnership between both.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trongate103.com/ |title=Trongate 103 |year=2008 |accessdate=30 July 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101113439/http://www.trongate103.com/ |archivedate=1 November 2008 }}</ref> The area also contains a number of theatres and concert venues, including the [[Tron Theatre]], the Old Fruitmarket, the Trades Hall, St. Andrew's in the Square, Merchant Square, and the [[Glasgow City Hall|City Halls]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/1 |title=Merchant City Glasgow: Venues and Theatres |publisher=Merchant City Glasgow&nbsp;– Merchant City Initiative |year=2008 |accessdate=30 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616150010/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/1 |archivedate=16 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Financial District (IFSD)====
[[File:ClydeArc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Clyde Arc]], also known as "Squinty Bridge"]]
To the western edge of the city centre, occupying the areas of [[Blythswood Hill]] and [[Anderston]], lies Glasgow's financial district, known officially as the [[International Financial Services District]] (IFSD), although often irreverently nicknamed by the contemporary press as the "square kilometre" or "Wall Street on Clyde".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/business/glasgow-flourish.html|title=Let Glasgow flourish|accessdate=29 July 2008|website=Scotland: the official online gateway|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513060215/http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/business/glasgow-flourish.html|archive-date=13 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since the late 1980s the construction of many modern office blocks and high rise developments have paved the way for the IFSD to become one of the UK's largest financial quarters. With a reputation as an established financial services centre, coupled with comprehensive support services, Glasgow continues to attract and grow new business.

Of the 10 largest general insurance companies in the UK, 8 have a base or head office in Glasgow&nbsp;— including [[Direct Line]], [[Esure]], [[AXA]] and [[Norwich Union]]. Key banking sector companies have also moved some of their services to commercial property in Glasgow&nbsp;– [[Resolution plc|Resolution]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Barclays Wealth]], [[Tesco Personal Finance]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Lloyds Banking Group]], [[Clydesdale Bank]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[HSBC]], [[Santander UK|Santander]] and the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]. The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] have several departments and [[Peel Group|Clydeport]], the [[Glasgow Stock Exchange]], [[Student Loans Company]], [[Scottish Executive Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department]], [[BT Group]], [[Scottish Friendly]]. [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] and [[Scottish Enterprise]] also have their headquarters in the district. [[Royal Dutch Shell]] also have one of their six worldwide Shared Business Centres located in the IFSD. [[Hilton Worldwide|Hilton]] have a corporate office based in the area.

===West End===
[[File:Side View of the Kelvingrove Art Museum.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] is Glasgow's premier museum and art gallery, housing one of Europe's best civic art collections.]]
Glasgow's West End grew firstly to and around [[Blythswood Square]] and [[Garnethill]], extending then to [[Woodlands Hill]] and [[A82 road|Great Western Road]]. It is a district of elegant townhouses and tenements with cafés, tea rooms, bars, boutiques, upmarket hotels, clubs and restaurants in the hinterland of [[Kelvingrove Park]], the [[University of Glasgow]], [[Glasgow Botanic Gardens]] and the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]], focused especially on the area's main thoroughfares of Argyle Street ([[Finnieston]]), Great Western Road and [[Byres Road]]. The area is popular with tourists and students.

The West End includes residential areas of [[Hillhead]], [[Dowanhill]], [[Kelvingrove Park|Kelvingrove]], [[Kelvinside]], [[Hyndland]], [[Broomhill, Glasgow|Broomhill]], [[Scotstoun]], [[Jordanhill]], [[Kelvindale]] and [[Anniesland]]
and, to an increasing extent, [[Partick]]. The name is also increasingly being used to refer to any area to the west of [[Charing Cross, Glasgow|Charing Cross]]. The West End is bisected by the [[River Kelvin]], which flows from the [[Campsie Fells]] in the north and confluences with the River Clyde at Yorkhill Quay.

The spire of [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir George Gilbert Scott]]'s [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow University]] main building (the second largest [[Gothic Revival]] building in Great Britain) is a major landmark, and can be seen from miles around, sitting atop Gilmorehill. The university itself is the fourth oldest in the [[English-speaking world]]. Much of the city's student population is based in the West End, adding to its cultural vibrancy.

The area is also home to the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery]], [[Kelvin Hall]] museums and research facilities, stores, and community sport.  Adjacent to the Kelvin Hall was the [[Glasgow Museum of Transport|Museum of Transport]], which reopened in 2010 after moving to a new location on a former dockland site at [[Glasgow Harbour]] where the River Kelvin flows into the Clyde. The new building is built to a design by [[Zaha Hadid]]. The [[West End Festival]], one of Glasgow's largest festivals, is held annually in June.

Glasgow is the home of the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|SECC]], Great Britain's largest exhibition and conference centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conferences-uk.org.uk/Glasgow.asp?venue=Scottish%20Exhibition%20and%20Conference%20Centre |title=Glasgow Conferences Venues UK |publisher=Conferences-uk.org.uk |date=17 July 1995 |accessdate=12 September 2009 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111093547/http://www.conferences-uk.org.uk/Glasgow.asp?venue=Scottish%20Exhibition%20and%20Conference%20Centre |archivedate=11 January 2009  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secc.co.uk/ |title=The home of the Scottish Exhibition + Conference Centre |publisher=SECC |accessdate=12 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907095647/http://www.secc.co.uk/ |archive-date=7 September 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.venuefinder.com/venues/scottish_exhibition_+_conference_centre/V8654/meeting-rooms/ |title= Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre |url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513101220/http://www.venuefinder.com/venues/scottish_exhibition_+_conference_centre/V8654/meeting-rooms/ |archivedate= 13 May 2011  }}</ref> On 30 September 2013, a major expansion of the SECC facilities at the former Queen's Dock by [[Foster and Partners]] officially opened – the 13,000 seat [[The Hydro|Hydro]] arena.

===East End===
[[File:People's Palace and Winter Gardens, Glasgow Green.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] museum on [[Glasgow Green]]]]
The East End extends from [[Glasgow Cross]] in the [[City Centre of Glasgow|City Centre]] to the boundary with [[North Lanarkshire|North]] and [[South Lanarkshire]]. It is home to the [[Glasgow Barrowland market]], popularly known as "The Barras",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgow-barrowland.com/ballroom.htm |title=The Official Glasgow Barrowland Ballroom Site |publisher=Glasgow Barrowland |accessdate=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415073429/http://www.glasgow-barrowland.com/ballroom.htm |archivedate=15 April 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Barrowland Ballroom]], [[Glasgow Green]], and [[Celtic Park]], home of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic FC]]. Many of the original sandstone tenements remain in this district. The East End was once a major industrial centre, home to [[Sir William Arrol & Co.]], [[James Templeton & Co]] and [[William Beardmore and Company]]. A notable local employer continues to be the [[Wellpark Brewery]], home of [[Tennent's Lager]].

The [[Glasgow Necropolis]] Garden Cemetery was created by the Merchants House on a hill above the [[Glasgow Cathedral|cathedral]] in 1831. Routes curve through the landscape uphill to the {{convert|62|m|ft|0|adj=on}} high statue of [[John Knox]] at the summit. There are two late 18th century tenements in Gallowgate. Dating from 1771 and 1780, both have been well restored. The construction of Charlotte Street was financed by [[David Dale]], whose former scale can be gauged by the one remaining house, now run by the [[National Trust for Scotland]]. Further along Charlotte Street there stands a modern [[Gillespie, Kidd & Coia]] building of some note. Once a school, it has been converted into offices. Surrounding these buildings are a series of innovative housing developments conceived as "Homes for the Future", part of a project during the city's year as UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |author=Glasgow Architecture |url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/homes_for_the_future_glasgow.htm |title=Homes for the Future, 1999 |publisher=Glasgow Architecture |year=1999 |accessdate=12 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604161655/http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/homes_for_the_future_glasgow.htm |archive-date=4 June 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

East of Glasgow Cross is [[St Andrew's in the Square]], the oldest post-Reformation church in Scotland, built in 1739–1757 and displaying a Presbyterian grandeur befitting the church of the city's wealthy [[Tobacco Lords|tobacco merchants]]. Also close by is the more modest [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]] [[St Andrew's-by-the-Green]], the oldest Episcopal church in Scotland. The Episcopalian St Andrew's was also known as the "Whistlin' Kirk" due to it being the first church after the Reformation to own an organ.

The extensive [[Tollcross, Glasgow|Tollcross Park]] was originally developed from the estate of James Dunlop, the owner of a local steelworks. His large [[Scots Baronial Style architecture|baronial]] mansion was built in 1848 by [[David Bryce]], which later housed the city's Children's Museum until the 1980s. Today, the mansion is a sheltered housing complex.

The new [[National Indoor Sports Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome|Scottish National Indoor Sports Arena]], a modern replacement for the [[Kelvin Hall]], is in [[Dalmarnock]]. The area was the site of the [[Olympic Village|Athletes' Village]] for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]], located adjacent to the new indoor sports arena.

The ''East End Healthy Living Centre'' (EEHLC) was established in mid-2005 at Crownpoint Road with Lottery Funding and City grants to serve community needs in the area. Now called the ''Glasgow Club Crownpoint Sports Complex'', the centre provides service such as sports facilities, health advice, stress management, leisure and vocational classes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eehlc.org.uk/ |title=East End Healthy Living Centre Homepage |publisher=Eehlc.org.uk |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505124226/http://www.eehlc.org.uk/ |archivedate=5 May 2014 }}</ref> To the north of the East End lie the two large [[gasometer]]s of [[Provan Gas Works]], which stand overlooking [[Alexandra Park, Glasgow|Alexandra Park]] and a major interchange between the M8 and [[M80 motorway|M80]] motorways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13243570.What_now_for_city_s_Provan_gas_towers_/|title=What now for city's Provan gas towers?|author=Rebecca Gray|work=[[Evening Times]]|date=21 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104050350/https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13243570.What_now_for_city_s_Provan_gas_towers_/|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13243570.What_now_for_city_s_Provan_gas_towers_/|title=Glasgow's skyline could be changing as future of historic Provan gasworks up for debate|author=Hannah Rodger|work=[[Evening Times]]|date=10 October 2017|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104050350/https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13243570.What_now_for_city_s_Provan_gas_towers_/|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/row-over-historic-protection-for-eyesore-gasworks-1-4742730|title=Row over historic protection for "eyesore" gasworks|author=Alison Campsie|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=21 May 2018|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104050154/https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/row-over-historic-protection-for-eyesore-gasworks-1-4742730|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===South Side===
Glasgow's South Side sprawls out south of the Clyde. The adjoining urban area includes some of Greater Glasgow's most affluent suburban towns, such as [[Newton Mearns]], [[Clarkston, East Renfrewshire|Clarkston]], and [[Giffnock]], all of which are in [[East Renfrewshire]], as well as [[Thorntonhall]] in [[South Lanarkshire]]. [[Newlands, Glasgow|Newlands]] and [[Dumbreck]] are examples of high-value residential districts within the city boundaries. There are many areas containing a high concentration of sandstone tenements, examples being [[Battlefield, Glasgow|Battlefield]], [[Govanhill]], [[Mount Florida]] and [[Shawlands]]. The large suburb of [[Pollokshields]] comprises both a quiet western part with undulating tree-lined boulevards lined with expensive villas, and a busier eastern part with a high-density grid of tenements and small shops. The south side also includes some post-war housing estates of various sizes such as [[Toryglen]], [[Pollok]], [[Castlemilk]] and [[Arden, Glasgow|Arden]]. The towns of [[Cambuslang]] and [[Rutherglen]] were included in the City of Glasgow district from 1975 to 1996, but are now in the [[South Lanarkshire]] council area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1973/oct/22/new-local-government-areas|title=New Local Government areas|publisher=[[Hansard]]|date=22 October 1973|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104050038/https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1973/oct/22/new-local-government-areas|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSFG|title=Modern Times: 1950s to The Present Day > Neighbourhoods|author=Irene Maver|website=The Glasgow Story|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029031254/http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSFG|archive-date=29 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/glasgow/|title=Scotland's Landscape: City of Glasgow|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317174830/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/glasgow/|archive-date=17 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although predominantly residential, the area does have several notable public buildings including, [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]'s [[Scotland Street School Museum]] and [[House for an Art Lover]]; the [[Burrell Collection]] in [[Pollok Country Park]]; [[Alexander "Greek" Thomson]]'s [[Holmwood House]] villa; the National Football Stadium [[Hampden Park]] in [[Mount Florida]] (home of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queens Park FC]]) and [[Ibrox Stadium]] (home of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers FC]]).

The former docklands site at [[Pacific Quay]] on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite the SECC, is the site of the [[Glasgow Science Centre]] and the headquarters of [[BBC Scotland]] and [[STV Group (Scotland)|STV Group]] (owner of [[STV (TV network)|STV]]), in a new purpose built digital media campus.

In addition, several new bridges spanning the River Clyde have been built, including the [[Clyde Arc]] known by locals as the Squinty Bridge at [[Pacific Quay]] and others at [[Tradeston]] and Springfield Quay.

The South Side also includes many public parks, including [[Linn Park, Glasgow, Scotland|Linn Park]], [[Queen's Park, Glasgow|Queen's Park]], and [[Bellahouston Park]], as well as [[Rouken Glen|Rouken Glen Park]], in neighbouring [[Giffnock]], and several golf clubs, including the championship course at [[Haggs Castle]]. The South Side is also home to the large [[Pollok Country Park]], which was awarded the accolade of Europe's Best Park 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/Parks_Outdoors/Parks_gardens/pollokparkbritainsbestpark.htm |title=Pollok Park Britain's Best Park |accessdate=20 June 2008 |website=Glasgow City Council |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615135645/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/Parks_Outdoors/Parks_gardens/pollokparkbritainsbestpark.htm |archivedate=15 June 2008}}</ref> Pollok Park is Glasgow's largest park and until the early 2000s was the only country park in the city's boundary. In the early 2000s the [[Dams to Darnley Country Park]] was designated, although half of the park is in [[East Renfrewshire]]. Having only been designated recently, the facilities at the park are currently quite lacking.

[[Govan]] is a district and former burgh in the south-western part of the city. It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite [[Partick]]. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912. Govan has a legacy as an engineering and [[shipbuilding]] centre of international repute and is home to one of two [[BAE Systems Surface Ships|BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards]] on the River Clyde and the [[precision engineering]] firm, [[Thales Optronics]]. It is also home to the [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital]], one of the largest hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the [[Glasgow Subway]] system. The wider Govan area includes the districts of [[Ibrox, Glasgow|Ibrox]], [[Cessnock, Glasgow|Cessnock]], [[Kinning Park]] and [[Kingston, Glasgow|Kingston]].

===North Glasgow===
[[File:Ruchill Church at canal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Ruchill Church Hall|Ruchill Church]], seen from the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]]]]
North Glasgow extends out from the north of the city centre towards the affluent suburbs of [[Bearsden]], [[Milngavie]] and [[Bishopbriggs]] in [[East Dunbartonshire]] and [[Clydebank]] in [[West Dunbartonshire]]. The area also contains some of the city's poorest residential areas. [[Possilpark]] is one such district, where levels of unemployment and drug abuse continue to be above the national average. Much of the housing in areas such as Possilpark and [[Hamiltonhill]] have fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

This has led to large-scale redevelopment of much of the poorer housing stock in north Glasgow, and the wider regeneration of many areas, such as [[Ruchill]], which have been transformed; many run-down tenements have now been refurbished or replaced by modern [[housing estate]]s. Much of the housing stock in north Glasgow is rented [[social housing]], with a high proportion of high-rise tower blocks, managed by the North Glasgow Housing Association trading as NG Homes and [[Glasgow Housing Association]].

[[Maryhill]] consists of well maintained traditional sandstone tenements. Although historically a working class area, its borders with the upmarket West End of the city mean that it is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the north of the city, containing affluent areas such as [[Maryhill Park]] and [[North Kelvinside]]. Maryhill is also the location of [[Firhill Stadium]], home of [[Partick Thistle F.C.]] since 1909. The [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] team, [[Maryhill F.C.]] are also located in this part of north Glasgow.

The [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] passes through this part of the city, and at one stage formed a vital part of the local economy. It was for many years polluted and largely unused after the decline of heavy industry, but recent efforts to regenerate and re-open the canal to navigation have seen it rejuvenated, including art campuses at Port Dundas.

[[Sighthill, Glasgow|Sighthill]] was home to Scotland's largest [[asylum seeker]] community but the area is now regenerated as part of the Youth Olympic Games bid.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nicoll |first1=Vivienne |title=Starting gun sounds for regeneration of Sighthill |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/starting-gun-sounds-for-regeneration-of-sighthill-158767n.23892373 |website=eveningtimes.co.uk |accessdate=26 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114753/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/starting-gun-sounds-for-regeneration-of-sighthill-158767n.23892373 |archive-date=26 August 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A huge part of the economic life of Glasgow was once located in [[Springburn]], where the [[Saracen Foundry]], engineering works of firms like [[Charles Tennant]] and locomotive workshops employed many Glaswegians. Indeed, Glasgow dominated this type of manufacturing, with 25% of all the world's locomotives being built in the area at one stage. It was home to the headquarters of the [[North British Locomotive Company]]. Today part of the [[Glasgow Works]] continues in use as a railway maintenance facility, all that is left of the industry in Springburn. It is proposed for closure in 2019.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-46545455 180 jobs under threat at Glasgow rail services firm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217133740/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-46545455 |date=17 December 2018 }} ''[[BBC News]]'' 12 December 2018</ref>

===Language===
''Glaswegian'', otherwise known as the [[Glasgow patter]], is a local variety of [[Scots language|Scots]].

Glaswegian is a dialect, more than an alternative pronunciation; words also change their meaning depending on context, e.g. "away" can mean "leaving" as in ''A'm away'', an instruction to stop being a nuisance as in ''away wi ye'', or "drunk" or "demented" as in ''he's away wi it''. ''Ginger'' is a term for any carbonated soft drink, historically referring to [[ginger beer]] (''A bottle o ginger'', {{IPA-sco|ə ˈboʔl ə ˈdʒɪndʒər|IPA}}). Then there are words whose meaning has no obvious relationship to that in standard English: ''coupon'' means "face", via "to punch a ticket coupon". A [[headbutt]] is known in many parts of the British Isles as a "Glasgow kiss", although this term is rarely used by Glaswegians, who say "Malkie", e.g., "ah'll Malkie ye" or "stick the heid/nut on ye".

Historically, a speaker of Glaswegian might refer to those originating from the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Western Isles]] as ''[[teuchter]]s'',<ref>[https://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/teuchter Teuchter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525075347/https://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/teuchter |date=25 May 2019 }}, [[Dictionary of the Scots Language]]</ref> while they would reciprocate by referring to Glaswegians as ''keelies'' (an old Scots word for a disreputable city dweller, which was reclaimed and embraced by locals).<ref>[https://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/keelie_n2_v Keelie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627213243/https://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/keelie_n2_v |date=27 June 2019 }}, Dictionary of the Scots Language</ref> More recently, the word ''weegie'' has become more widely used to describe Glaswegians.<ref>{{cite book |last=McCall |first=Ian |date=2012 |title=Going going gone: An abc of disappearing artefacts, customs, ideas and practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MzMHBAAAQBAJ&q=%22the+term+weegie%22&pg=PA54 |location= |publisher=Cross Border Consultants |page=54 |isbn=978-1-300-16736-5 |author-link= }}</ref><ref>[https://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/sndns4089 Weegie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718153929/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/sndns4089 |date=18 July 2018 }}, Dictionary of the Scots Language</ref>

The long-running TV drama ''[[Taggart]]'' and the comedies ''[[Empty (TV series)|Empty]]'', ''[[Chewin' the Fat]]'', ''[[Rab C. Nesbitt]]'', ''[[Still Game]]'', ''[[Limmy's Show]]'' and ''[[Dear Green Place]]'' depict the Glaswegian ''[[patois]]'', while [[Kevin Bridges]], [[Frankie Boyle]], [[Craig Ferguson]] and [[Billy Connolly]] have made Glaswegian humour known to the rest of the world. Now the Urdu/Hindi language is also widely spoken among the [[Pakistani]] and Indian ethnic-origin population of the city.
Glasgow is Scotland's main locus of [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] language use outside the [[Highlands and Islands]]. In 2011, 5,878 residents of the city over age 3 spoke Gaelic, amounting to 1.0% of the population.

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture in Glasgow}}
[[File:Clyde Auditorium, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lord Foster]]'s [[Clyde Auditorium]], colloquially known as 'the Armadillo']]
Very little of [[medieval]] Glasgow remains; the two main landmarks from this period being the 15th century [[Provand's Lordship]] and 13th century [[St. Mungo's Cathedral]], although the original medieval street plan (along with many of the street names) on the eastern side of the city centre has largely survived intact. Also in the 15th century began the building of [[Cathcart Castle]], completed C.1450 with an impressive view over the landscape in all directions. It was at this castle [[Mary Queen of Scots]] supposedly spent the night before her defeat at the [[Battle of Langside]] in May 1568. The Castle was Demolished in 1980 for safety reasons. The vast majority of the city as seen today dates from the 19th century. As a result, Glasgow has an impressive heritage of [[Victorian architecture]]: the [[Glasgow City Chambers]]; the main building of the [[University of Glasgow]], designed by [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir George Gilbert Scott]]; and the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John W. Simpson]], are notable examples.

The city is notable for architecture designed by the [[Glasgow School]], the most notable exponent of that style being [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]. Mackintosh was an architect and designer in the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the main exponent of [[Art Nouveau]] in the United Kingdom, designing numerous noted Glasgow buildings such as the [[Glasgow School of Art]], [[Willow Tearooms]] and the [[Scotland Street School Museum]]. A hidden gem of Glasgow, also designed by Mackintosh, is the [[Queen's Cross Church, Glasgow|Queen's Cross Church]], the only church by the renowned artist to be built.<ref>[http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&vxChannel=SeeScot%20Places&vxClipId=1380_SMG1835&vxBitrate=300 Watch video of the church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605023607/http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&vxChannel=SeeScot%20Places&vxClipId=1380_SMG1835&vxBitrate=300 |date=5 June 2009 }} and Interview with Stuart Robertson, Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society Director</ref>

Another architect who has had an enduring impact on the city's appearance is [[Alexander Thomson]], with notable examples including the [[Holmwood House]] villa, and likewise Sir [[John James Burnet]], awarded the R.I.B.A's Royal Gold Medal for his lifetime's service to architecture. The buildings reflect the wealth and self-confidence of the residents of the "Second City of the Empire". Glasgow generated immense wealth from trade and the industries that developed from the Industrial Revolution. The [[shipyard]]s, [[Naval architecture|marine engineering]], steel making, and [[heavy industry]] all contributed to the growth of the city.

Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built with red or blond [[sandstone]], but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the [[furnace]]s, until the [[Clean Air Act 1956|Clean Air Act]] was introduced in 1956. In recent years many of these buildings have been cleaned and restored to their original appearance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} There are over 1,800 listed buildings in the city, of architectural and historical importance, and 23 Conservation Areas extending over 1,471 hectares. Such areas include the Central Area, Dennistoun, the West End, Pollokshields – the first major planned garden suburb in Britain – Newlands and Carmunnock Village.<ref>Glasgow City Council Planning Department reports</ref>

Modern buildings in Glasgow include the [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]], and along the banks of the Clyde are the [[Glasgow Science Centre]], [[The Hydro]] and the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]], whose [[Clyde Auditorium]] was designed by [[Norman Foster (architect)|Sir Norman Foster]], and is colloquially known as the "[[Armadillo]]".

===Public transport===
[[File:AM Glasgow Central.JPG|thumb|[[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central station]] is the northern terminus of the [[West Coast Main Line]].]]
[[File:Greater Glasgow rail passengers 2018-19.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Rail passengers 2018–19]]
Glasgow has a large urban transport system, mostly managed by the [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport]] (SPT).

The city has many bus services; since [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|bus deregulation]] almost all are provided by private operators, though SPT part-funds some services. The principal bus operators within the city are: [[First Glasgow]], [[McGill's Bus Services]], [[Stagecoach West Scotland]] and [[Glasgow Citybus]]. The main bus terminal in the city is [[Buchanan bus station]].

Glasgow has the most extensive [[commuter rail|urban rail]] network in the UK outside London, with rail services travelling to a large part of the [[Strathclyde|West of Scotland]]. Most lines were electrified under [[British Rail]]. All trains running within Scotland, including the local Glasgow trains, are operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]], who owns the franchise as determined by the [[Scottish Government]]. [[Glasgow Central railway station|Central station]] and [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]] are the two main railway terminals. Glasgow Central is the terminus of the {{convert|642|km|mi|adj=on}} long [[West Coast Main Line]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/virgin/ |title=West Coast Main Line Pendolino Tilting Trains, United Kingdom |publisher=Railway-technology.com |accessdate=25 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827004335/http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/virgin/ |archive-date=27 August 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], as well as [[TransPennine Express]] services from Manchester and [[CrossCountry]] services from Birmingham, Bristol, Plymouth and various other destinations in England. Glasgow Central is also the terminus for suburban services on the south side of Glasgow, Ayrshire and Inverclyde, as well as being served by the cross city link from Dalmuir to Motherwell. Most other services within Scotland&nbsp;– the main line to Edinburgh, plus services to Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and the Western Highlands&nbsp;– operate from Queen Street station.

The city's suburban network is currently divided by the River Clyde and the [[Crossrail Glasgow]] initiative has been proposed to link them; it is currently awaiting funding from the Scottish Government. The city is linked to Edinburgh by [[Glasgow to Edinburgh Lines|four direct railway links]]. In addition to the suburban rail network, SPT operates the [[Glasgow Subway]]. The Subway is the United Kingdom's only completely underground [[rapid transit|metro]] system and is generally recognised as the world's third oldest underground railway after the [[London Underground]] and the [[Budapest Metro]].<ref>{{cite web |author=SPT |url=http://www.spt.co.uk/subway/facts.html |title=SPT Subway |date=16 April 1980 |accessdate=12 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229231523/http://www.spt.co.uk/subway/facts.html |archivedate=29 December 2007}}</ref> Both railway and subway stations have a number of [[park and ride]] facilities.

As part of the wider regeneration along the banks of the River Clyde, a [[bus rapid transit]] system called [[Clyde Fastlink]] is operational between Glasgow City Centre to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spt.co.uk/corporate/about/projects/fastlink/|title=Fastlink – SPT – Corporate Information – Strathclyde Partnership for Transport|website=www.spt.co.uk|access-date=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905071858/http://www.spt.co.uk/corporate/about/projects/fastlink|archive-date=5 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Shipping===
Global-ship-management is carried out by maritime and logistics firms in Glasgow, in client companies employing over 100,000 seafarers. This reflects maritime skills over many decades and the training and education of deck officers and marine engineers from around the world at the [[City of Glasgow College]], Nautical Campus, from which graduate around one third of all such graduates in the United Kingdom.<ref name="cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016032603/https://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk/ |archive-date=16 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The main operational dock within Glasgow operated by [[Peel Group|Clydeport]] is the [[King George V Dock, Glasgow|King George V Dock]], near Braehead. Since the advent of [[Containerization|containerisation]], most other facilities, such as [[Hunterston Terminal]], are located in the deep waters of the [[Firth of Clyde#Shipping in the Firth|Firth of Clyde]], which together handle some 7.5&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo each year.

===Roads===
[[File:Wfm m8 motorway.jpg|thumb|The [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]], which crosses the Clyde over the Kingston Bridge, is Scotland's busiest [[motorway]].]] The main M8 motorway passes around the city centre and connects with the [[M77 motorway|M77]], [[M74 motorway|M74]], [[M73 motorway|M73]] and [[M80 motorway|M80]] motorways, all of which pass within the city's boundaries. The [[A82 road|A82]] connects Glasgow to [[Argyll and Bute|Argyll]] and the western [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. The [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|M74]] runs directly south towards [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].

Other strategic roads in the city include the [[Glasgow East End Regeneration Route|East End Regeneration Route]], which provides easier access to areas of the East End, linking the M8 to the extended M74.

===Airports===
The city has three international airports within 45 minutes travel of the city centre, as well as a centrally located seaplane terminal. Two are dedicated to Glasgow while the third is Edinburgh International which, as it is situated on the west side of Edinburgh, is relatively close to Glasgow. These airports are [[Glasgow Airport]] (GLA) ({{convert|8|mi|km|sigfig=1}} west of the city centre) in Renfrewshire, [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport]] (PIK) ({{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1}} south west) in Ayrshire, [[Edinburgh Airport]] (EDI), ({{convert|34|mi|km|sigfig=1}} east) in Edinburgh and [[Glasgow Seaplane Terminal]], by the Glasgow Science Centre on the River Clyde. There are also several smaller, domestic and private airports around the city. There is a heliport, [[Glasgow City Heliport]], located at Stobcross Quay on the banks of the Clyde.

All of the international airports are easily accessible by public transport, with GLA and EDI directly linked by a bus routes from the main bus station and a direct rail connection to PIK from Glasgow Central Station. A series of proposals to provide a direct rail link to Glasgow International Airport have ended unsuccessfully, beginning with the [[Glasgow Airport Rail Link]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8256474.stm |title=Ministers scrap airport rail plan |work=BBC News |date=17 September 2009 |access-date=7 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728210311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8256474.stm |archive-date=28 July 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> As of 2019, local authorities have approved plans for a "Glasgow Metro", including a connection to the International Airport.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-51008481 |title=Glasgow Airport Metro system gets council leader approval |date=6 January 2020 |accessdate=29 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{main|History of football in Scotland}}
[[File:Hampden Park Panorama.jpg|thumb|Glasgow is home to [[Hampden Park]], home of the [[Scotland national football team]]]]
The world's first international [[Association football|football]] match was held in 1872 at the [[West of Scotland Cricket Club]]'s [[Hamilton Crescent]] ground in the [[Partick]] area of the city. The match, between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]] finished 0–0.

Glasgow was the first city (since joined by [[Liverpool]] in 1985, [[Madrid]] in 1986, 2014, 2016 and 2018, [[Milan]] in 1994 and [[London]] in 2019) to have had two football teams in European finals in the same season:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.soccerattic.com/article/when-scottish-football-took-europe-by-storm-1967/ |title=Europe Belongs To Us|author=Ken Gallagher|work=Charlie Buchan's Football Monthly |date=1 July 1967|via=Soccer Attic |accessdate=30 September 2018}}</ref> in 1967, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] competed in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final with rivals [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] competing in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] final. Rangers were the first football club from the United Kingdom to reach a European final, doing so in [[1961 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1961]]. They have also won more domestic top-tier league titles than any other football club in the world (currently 54). Celtic were the first non-Latin club to win the European Cup, under the management of [[Jock Stein]] in [[1966–67 European Cup|1967]], before [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] the following year. Celtic also went on to reach another European Cup Final in [[1970 European Cup Final|1970]], losing to [[Feyenoord]], and also the final of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[2003 UEFA Cup Final|2003]], where they lost an enthralling match which finished 3–2 to Portuguese club [[FC Porto|Porto]]. Rangers also reached the final of the same competition in [[2008 UEFA Cup Final|2008]], where they lost to [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]] of Russia.

[[Hampden Park]], which is Scotland's national football stadium, holds the European record for attendance at a football match: 149,547<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/glasgow/glw_hampden.htm|publisher=Glasgow Photo Library|title=Hampden Stadium|accessdate=9 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814135942/http://www.rampantscotland.com/glasgow/glw_hampden.htm|archive-date=14 August 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> saw Scotland beat England 3–1 in 1937, in the days before leading British stadia became [[All-seater stadium|all-seated]].

Prior to this, Glasgow had two other professional teams: [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] (since moved to [[Cumbernauld]]) and [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] (liquidated in 1967), plus four others active in the league in the 19th century: [[Thistle F.C.|Thistle]], [[Cowlairs F.C.|Cowlairs]], [[Northern F.C.|Northern]] and [[Linthouse F.C.|Linthouse]]. There are a number of [[West of Scotland Football League]] clubs within the city as well, such as [[Pollok F.C.|Pollok]], [[Maryhill F.C.|Maryhill]], [[Benburb F. C.|Benburb]], [[Ashfield F.C.|Ashfield]], [[Glasgow Perthshire F.C.]], [[Shettleston F.C.|Shettleston]], and [[Petershill F.C.|Petershill]], plus numerous amateur teams.

Glasgow has a professional [[rugby union]] club, the [[Glasgow Warriors]], which plays in the European Rugby Champions Cup and [[Pro14]] alongside teams from Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Italy. The Warriors current home is [[Scotstoun Stadium]] and has been since 2012, previously they played at [[Firhill Stadium]]. They have won the [[Melrose 7s]] in both 2014 and 2015 and were also crowned champions of the Pro12 at the end of the 2014/15 season after beating Irish side Munster in Belfast.

In the Scottish League, [[Glasgow Hawks RFC]] was formed in 1997 by the merger of two of Glasgow's oldest clubs: [[Glasgow Academicals RFC|Glasgow Academicals]] and [[Glasgow High Kelvinside]] (GHK). Despite the merger, the second division teams of Glasgow Academicals and Glasgow High Kelvinside re-entered the Scottish rugby league in 1998.

South of Glasgow, in East Renfrewshire, in the suburb of Giffnock, is based another of Glasgow area's most prominent clubs [[Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians RFC]] (GHA). GHA was formed in 2002 with the merger of two of Glasgow's leading clubs at the time, [[Glasgow Southern RFC]] and [[Hutchesons Aloysians]] RFC.

[[Cartha Queens Park RFC|Cartha Queen's Park]] play at Dumbreck, within the city.

Glasgow was also home to one of the oldest rugby clubs in Scotland,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westofscotlandfc.co.uk/about-us/club-history|title=Club History|website=westofscotlandfc.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122826/http://www.westofscotlandfc.co.uk/about-us/club-history|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> [[West of Scotland F.C.]], which was formed in 1865, and was a founding member of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]].

The City of Glasgow has a number of ice rinks, and a temporary one is set up in George Square in the Christmas period.

From 1966 to 1986, the Glasgow Dynamos played at Crossmyloof Ice Rink.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://glasgowdynamos.tripod.com/ |title=Glasgow Dynamos Remembered |publisher=Glasgowdynamos.tripod.com |accessdate=5 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310152701/http://glasgowdynamos.tripod.com/ |archive-date=10 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since October 2010 a team called the [[Glasgow Clan]] based in the nearby [[Braehead Arena]] in [[Renfrewshire]] has played in the professional [[Elite Ice Hockey League]] alongside three other Scottish teams, the [[Fife Flyers]], [[Dundee Stars]] and the [[Edinburgh Capitals]]. This is the first time that a top level [[ice hockey]] team has represented Glasgow.

===Swimming===
The [[Arlington Baths Club]] is the oldest swimming club in the world, founded in 1870. The Club in Arlington Street, in the [[Woodlands, Glasgow|Woodlands]] area of the city is still thriving today. It is believed the club's first Baths Master [[William Wilson (aquatics)|William Wilson]] invented [[water polo]] at the club. The Arlington inspired other Swimming Clubs and the [[Western Baths]], which opened in 1876, is also still in existence in nearby [[Hillhead]]. Most of Glasgow's Victorian and Edwardian Municipal Pools have been closed or demolished, with the city council investing in large new leisure centres such as [[Tollcross International Swimming Centre|Tollcross]], [[Springburn]], Gorbals, [[Scotstoun]] and [[Bellahouston]]. A community group is however hoping to re-open [[Govanhill]] Baths, on the city's southside.

===Basketball===
Glasgow hosts Scotland's only professional basketball team, the [[Glasgow Rocks]], who compete in the [[British Basketball League]]. Previously based in Renfrewshire's [[Braehead Arena]] and the 1,200 seater Kelvin Hall, the team has been based at the Emirates Arena since the 2012/13 season.
