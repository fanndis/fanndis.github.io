{{Banking in the United States}}

The '''Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation''' ('''FDIC''') is one of two agencies that provide  [[deposit insurance]] to depositors in U.S. depository institutions, the other being the [[National Credit Union Administration]], which regulates and insures [[credit union]]s. The FDIC is a [[State-owned enterprises of the United States|United States government corporation]] providing [[deposit insurance]] to depositors in U.S. [[commercial bank]]s and [[savings bank]]s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2018-08-01|title=Regulatory Monitors: Policing Firms in the Compliance Era|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/265|journal=Faculty Scholarship}}</ref>'''{{rp|15}}''' The FDIC was created by the [[1933 Banking Act]], enacted during the [[Great Depression]] to restore trust in the American banking system. More than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and [[bank runs]] were common.<ref name=":0" />'''{{rp|15}}'''{{sfn|Walter|2005|p=39}} The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category, and this was increased several times over the years. Since the passage of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US$250,000 per ownership category.<ref>{{cite web |title=FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 is now permanent|url=http://www.boston.com/business/personalfinance/managingyourmoney/archives/2010/09/fdic_insurance_3.html|website=Boston Globe}}</ref>

The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding.{{sfn|Bovenzi|2015|p=69}} The FDIC also has a US$100 billion [[line of credit]] with the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/insurance/assuringconfidence.pdf |title=Deposit Insurance Funding: Assuring Confidence |website=fdic.gov |last1=Ellis |first1=Diane }}</ref>

{{As of|2019|9|df=|alt=As of September 2019}}, the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 5,256 institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fdic.gov/bank/statistical/stats/2018dec/industry.pdf|title=Statistics at a Glance - December 31, 2018|date=2018-12-31|website=Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529001748/https://www.fdic.gov/bank/statistical/stats/2018dec/industry.pdf|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks.

==Ownership categories==
[[File:Arlington FDIC office.jpg|thumb|right|The FDIC's satellite campus in [[Arlington, Virginia]], is home to many administrative and support functions, though the most senior officials work at the main building in Washington]]

Each ownership category of a depositor's money is insured separately up to the insurance limit, and separately at each bank. Thus a depositor with $250,000 in each of three ownership categories at each of two banks would have six different insurance limits of $250,000, for total insurance coverage of 6 × $250,000 = $1,500,000.<ref name=YID>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/index.html|title=FDIC: Understanding Deposit Insurance}}</ref> The distinct ownership categories are<ref name=YID/>
* Single accounts (accounts not falling into any other category)
* Certain retirement accounts (including [[Individual Retirement Account]]s (IRAs))
* Joint accounts (accounts with more than one owner with equal rights to withdraw)
* Revocable trust accounts (containing the words "Payable on death", "In trust for", etc.)
* Irrevocable trust accounts
* Employee Benefit Plan accounts (deposits of a pension plan)
* Corporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association accounts
* Government accounts

All amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to $250,000.

For joint accounts, each co-owner is assumed (unless the account specifically states otherwise) to own the same fraction of the account as does each other co-owner (even though each co-owner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account). Thus if three people jointly own a $750,000 account, the entire account balance is insured because each depositor's $250,000 share of the account is insured.

The owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary (subject to special rules if there are more than five of them). Thus if there is a single owner of an account that is specified as in trust for (payable on death to, etc.) three different beneficiaries, the funds in the account are insured up to $750,000.

==Board of directors==
The Board of Directors of the FDIC is the governing body of the FDIC. The board is composed of five members, three appointed by the [[president of the United States]] with the consent of the [[United States Senate]] and two [[ex officio]] members. The three appointed members each serve six-year terms. No more than three members of the board may be of the same political affiliation. The president, with the consent of the Senate, also designates one of the appointed members as chairman of the board, to serve a five-year term, and one of the appointed members as vice chairman of the board. The two ex officio members are the Comptroller of the Currency and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

As of March 2019, the members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were:
* [[Jelena McWilliams]] – Chairman of the Board
* ''Vacant'' – Vice Chairman
* [[Martin J. Gruenberg]] – Internal Director
* [[Brian P. Brooks]] – Acting [[Comptroller of the Currency]]
* [[Kathy Kraninger]] – Director, [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fdic.gov/about/learn/board/index.html|title=FDIC: Board of Directors & Senior Executives|website=Fdic.gov|access-date=2020-10-19}}</ref>

==History==

===Panics of 1893 and 1907 and the Great Depression: 1893-1933===
{{Further|Panic of 1907|Great Depression}}
During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, many banks{{NoteTag|Around 491 commercial banks failed in 1893, and 243 between 1907 and 1908.<ref name="white538">{{Harvnb|White|1981|p=538}}.</ref>}} filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, [[William Jennings Bryan]] presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time.<ref name="white538" />

After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds.{{Sfn|White|1981|pp=537-538}} Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch, small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states.<ref name="white539">{{Harvnb|White|1981|p=539}}</ref> In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US.{{Sfn|Walter|2005|p=44}} The [[Federal Reserve Act]] initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. From 1893 to the FDIC's creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.{{Sfn|Golembe|1960|p=188}}

During the Great Depression there was widespread panic again over the American banking system due to fears over the strength of many banks; more than one-third of all U.S. banks were closed by bank runs.{{sfn|Walter|2005|p=39}} Bank runs, sudden demands by large numbers of customers to withdraw all their funds at almost the same time, brought down many bank companies as depositors attempted to withdraw more money than the bank had available as cash. Small banks in rural areas were especially affected. Written and publicly announced reassurances and tightened regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears.

===Establishment of the FDIC: 1933===
[[File:Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs Banking Act of 1935.jpg|right|thumb|300px|President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] signs the Banking Act of 1935.]]

President [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, "We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future." But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.{{Sfn|Shaw|2015|p=47}} On 16 June 1933, Roosevelt signed the 1933 Banking Act into law, creating the FDIC. The initial plan set by Congress in 1934 was to insure deposits up to $2,500 (${{Inflation|US|2500|1934|fmt=c}} today){{Inflation-fn|US|}} adopting of a more generous, long-term plan after six months.{{NoteTag|The latter plan was to insure all deposits up to $10,000 (${{Inflation|US|10000|1934|fmt=c}}), 75 percent of all deposits over $10,000 to $50,000 (${{Inflation|US|50000|1934|fmt=c}}), and 50 percent of anything over $50,000. Brackets indicate amount taking into account [[Consumer price index|consumer price]] inflation from 1934.{{Inflation-fn|US|}}}} However, the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to $5,000 (${{Inflation|US|5000|1934|fmt=c}} today).{{Inflation-fn|US}}{{Sfn|Golembe|1960|p=193}}

The 1933 Banking Act:
* Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation. The Banking Act of 1935 made the FDIC a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the $5,000 level.
* Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks
* Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state non-member banks
* Funded the FDIC with initial loans of $289 million through the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which were later paid back with interest
* Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time
* Separated commercial and investment banking ([[Glass–Steagall Act]])
* Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts
* Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state law.

[[File:FDIC 2500 sign by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Bank sign indicating the original insurance limit offered by the FDIC of $2,500 in 1934]]

===Historical insurance limits===
The per-depositor insurance limit has increased over time to accommodate [[inflation]].

* 1934 – $2,500
* 1935 – $5,000
* 1950 – $10,000
* 1966 – $15,000
* 1969 – $20,000
* 1974 – $40,000
* 1980 – $100,000
* 2008 – $250,000

Congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which was effective from October 3, 2008, through December 31, 2010. On May 20, 2009, the temporary increase was extended through December 31, 2013. The [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (P.L.111-203), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Changes in FDIC Deposit Insurance Coverage |date=July 21, 2010 |url=http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/changes.html |publisher=fdic.gov |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122230145/http://fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/changes.html |archive-date=November 22, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reform of Deposit Insurance (including the adjustment to $250,000 and allowing for adjustments every five years) |url=http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/insurance/reform.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2006-03-23/pdf/06-2779.pdf |title=FDIC Interim rule |publisher=gpo.gov }}</ref>

FDIC-insured institutions are permitted to display a sign stating the terms of its insurance — that is, the per-depositor limit and the guarantee of the United States government. The FDIC describes this sign as a symbol of confidence for depositors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/assistance/protection/depaccounts/confidence/symbol.html|title=FDIC: Symbol of Confidences}}</ref> As part of a 1987 legislative enactment, Congress passed a measure stating "it is the sense of the Congress that it should reaffirm that deposits up to the statutorily prescribed amount in federally insured depository institutions are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/4000-2660.html|access-date=2009-01-16|title=4000 - Advisory Opinions: Full Faith and Credit of U.S. Government Behind the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund}}</ref>

===S&L and bank crisis of the 1980s===
{{Main|Savings and loan crisis}}
Federal deposit insurance received its first large-scale test since the Great Depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the [[savings and loan crisis]] (which also affected commercial banks and savings banks).

The [[Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation]] (FSLIC) had been created to insure deposits held by [[savings and loan]] institutions ("S&Ls", or [[Savings and loan association|"thrifts"]]).  Because of a confluence of events, much of the S&L industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well.  FSLIC's reserves were insufficient to pay off the depositors of all of the failing thrifts, and fell into insolvency.  FSLIC was abolished in August 1989 and replaced by the [[Resolution Trust Corporation]] (RTC).  On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] ([[credit union]]s remained insured by the [[National Credit Union Administration]]). The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the [[Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989]] (FIRREA), and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991]] (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.

Final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of FSLIC and RTC resolutions was an estimated $152.9 billion. Of this total amount, U.S. taxpayer losses amounted to approximately $123.8 billion (81% of the total costs.)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/banking/2000dec/brv13n2_2.pdf |title=The Cost of the Savings and Loan Crisis |access-date=2008-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029215944/http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/banking/2000dec/brv13n2_2.pdf |archive-date=2008-10-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

No taxpayer money was used to resolve FDIC-insured institutions.

</ref> Washington Mutual's collapse prompted a run on [[Wachovia]], another large and troubled bank, as depositors drew their accounts below the $100,000 insurance limit. To avoid a panic and a drain on its insurance fund, the FDIC used exceptional authority to arrange a noncompetitive acquisition of Wachovia. It then established the [[Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program]] (TLGP), which guaranteed deposits and unsecured debt instruments used for day-to-day payments. Congress temporarily raised the insurance limit to $250,000 to promote depositor confidence.

====2009====
On August 21, 2009, [[Guaranty Bank (Texas)|Guaranty Bank]], in [[Texas]], became insolvent and was taken over by [[BBVA Compass]], the U.S. division of [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria]], the second-largest bank in [[Spain]]. This was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the financial crisis. In addition, the FDIC agreed to share losses with BBVA on about $11 billion of Guaranty Bank's loans and other assets.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2009/08/21/news/companies/banks.invasion.fortune/?postversion=2009082115 | work=CNN | title=Foreign banks can't save everyone | date=August 21, 2009 | access-date=May 2, 2010 | first=Colin | last=Barr | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002095000/https://money.cnn.com/2009/08/21/news/companies/banks.invasion.fortune/?postversion=2009082115 | archive-date=October 2, 2009 }}</ref> This transaction alone cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $3 billion.

To continue meeting its obligations, it demanded three years of advance premiums from its members and operated the fund with a negative net balance.

====2010====
In 2010, a new division within the FDIC, the Office of Complex Financial Institutions, was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the FDIC by the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] for the assessment of risk in the largest, systemically important financial institutions, or [[SIFI]]s.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/james-wigand-the-fdics-complexity-czar-10132011.html James Wigand, the FDIC's Complexity Czar], By Yalman Onaran, Bloomberg Businessweek, October 13, 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2010/pr10184.html  FDIC Announces Organizational Changes to Help Implement Recently Enacted Regulatory Reform by Congress], FDIC press release, August 10, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://dodd-frank.com/fdic-creates-office-of-complex-financial-institutions/ FDIC Creates Office of Complex Financial Institutions], by Steve Quinlivan, article at dodd-frank.com, private website, August 10, 2010.</ref>

A total of 157 banks with approximately $92 billion in total assets failed.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/bank/2010/index.html  |title=Bank Failures in Brief: 2010| access-date=2019-05-22 }}</ref> The Deposit Insurance Fund returned to a positive net balance near the start of 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to increase it to 1.35% of total insured deposits, a goal that was reached in 2018. That year also saw no bank failures for the first time since the crisis.

==Funds==
Between 1989 and 2006, there were two separate FDIC funds&nbsp;– the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted to qualify for the BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.<ref>Sicilia, David B. & Cruikshank, Jeffrey L. (2000). ''The Greenspan Effect'', pp. 96–97. New York: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-134919-7}}.</ref>

Then Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] [[Alan Greenspan]] was a critic of the system, saying, "We are, in effect, attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item{{spaced ndash}}namely, government-mandated deposit insurance. Such price differences only create efforts by market participants to [[arbitrage]] the difference." Greenspan proposed "to end this game and merge SAIF and BIF".<ref>Sicilia & Cruikshank, pp. 97–98.</ref> In February 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] signed into law the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005]] (FDIRA). The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, as well as a number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund and Savings Association Insurance Fund into a single fund, the '''Deposit Insurance Fund'''. This change was made effective March 31, 2006.

The FDIC maintains the insurance fund by assessing a premium on member institutions. The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured [[deposit account|deposits]] as well as on the degree of [[risk]] the institution poses to the fund. When the FDIC assumes control of a failed institution, it uses the insurance fund to pay depositors their insured balances. This results in a loss to the fund that must be replenished from the assets of the failed bank or from member bank premiums. In the event that the FDIC exhausts the insurance fund and cannot meet obligations with advances from member banks, it has a statutory $100 billion line of credit from the federal Treasury.

To receive this benefit, member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements. Banks are classified in five groups according to their risk-based [[Capital adequacy ratio|capital ratio]]:
* Well capitalized: 10% or higher
* Adequately capitalized: 8% or higher
* Undercapitalized: less than 8%
* Significantly undercapitalized: less than 6%
* Critically undercapitalized: less than 2%

When a bank becomes undercapitalized, the institution's primary regulator issues a warning to the bank. When the number drops below 6%, the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action. When the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the FDIC as receiver of the bank.

At Q4 2010, 884 banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the FDIC's "[[FDIC problem bank list|problem list]]".

==Resolution of insolvent banks==
Upon a determination that a bank is insolvent, its chartering authority—either a state banking department or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—closes it and appoints the FDIC as receiver. In its role as a receiver the FDIC is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution. The FDIC as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the FDIC acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer. Courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities as having distinct rights, duties and obligations.

The goals of receivership are to market the assets of a failed institution, liquidate them, and distribute the proceeds to the institution's creditors. The FDIC as receiver succeeds to the rights, powers, and privileges of the institution and its stockholders, officers, and directors. It may collect all obligations and money due to the institution, preserve or liquidate its assets and property, and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment. It also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency, court, or party with contractual rights. It may form a new institution, such as a [[bridge bank]], to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution, or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the FDIC in its corporate capacity.

The two most common ways for the FDIC to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are:
* '''Purchase and Assumption Agreement''' (P&A), in which deposits (liabilities) are assumed by an open bank, which also purchases some or all of the failed bank's loans (assets). The bank's assets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/buying/|title=FDIC: Institution & Asset Sales|website=www.fdic.gov}}</ref> that convey to the FDIC as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods, including online, and using contractors.
* '''Deposit Payoff''', as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, the FDIC is appointed receiver. The FDIC as insurer pays all of the failed institution's depositors<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/reshandbook/ch2procs.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317033538/http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/reshandbook/ch2procs.pdf |archive-date=2013-03-17 }}</ref> with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver's collections on the failed institution's assets.

In 1991, to comply with legislation, the FDIC amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds. The procedures require the FDIC to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution. Bids are submitted to the FDIC where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made.

===Covered Insured Depository Institutions Resolution Plans===
To assist the FDIC in resolving an insolvent bank, the FDIC requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the Dodd Frank Act. In addition to the Bank Holding Company ("BHC") resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d),<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/first-take-dodd-frank-act-resolution-planning.jhtml|title= First take: Resolution plan guidance to largest firms}}</ref> the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured Depository Institution ("CIDI") resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC's core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., "material entities"), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.<ref name="pwc.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/2014-resolution-plan-cidis.pdf|title= First take: Ten key points from the FDIC's resolution plan guidance |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, December, 2014}}</ref>

On December 17, the FDIC issued guidance for the 2015 resolution plans of CIDIs of large bank holding companies (BHCs).<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2014/pr14109a.pdf|title= Guidance for Covered Insured Depository Institution Resolution Plan Submissions |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, December, 2014}}</ref> The guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the CIDI resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the 2015 CIDI resolution plans including:<ref name="pwc.com"/>
* The assumption that the CIDI must fail.
* The cause of CIDI failure must be a core business loss or impairment.
* At least one "multiple acquirer strategy" is required in the plan.
* A deep level of granularity is expected in the plan.
* Sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail.
* A detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed.
* Key legal issues must be considered.
* Resolution obstacles must be addressed.
* The CIDI must be insolvent at the start of resolution.

==Insured products==
[[File:Jumbo cd rates fdic coverage.jpg|thumb|Example of FDIC insurance coverage]]
FDIC deposit insurance covers [[deposit account]]s, which, by the FDIC definition, include:
* [[checking account|demand deposits]] (checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest), and [[negotiable order of withdrawal account]]s (NOW accounts, i.e., savings accounts that have check-writing privileges)
* [[savings account]]s and [[money market deposit account]]s (MMDAs, i.e., higher-interest savings accounts subject to check-writing restrictions)
* [[time deposit]]s including [[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]] (CDs)
* outstanding cashier's checks, interest checks, and other [[negotiable instrument]]s drawn on the accounts of the bank
* accounts denominated in foreign currencies<ref name="fdic-reg">{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/2000-5400.html#2000part330.3 |title=FDIC Law, Regulations, Related Acts – Rules and Regulations |publisher=Fdic.gov |access-date=2011-09-15}}</ref>
Accounts at different banks are insured separately. All branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank. Also, an [[Internet]] bank that is part of a [[brick and mortar]] bank is not considered to be a separate bank, even if the name differs. Non-US citizens are also covered by FDIC insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an FDIC-insured bank.<ref name="fdic-reg"/>

The FDIC publishes a guide entitled "Your Insured Deposits",<ref>[http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insured/index.html fdic.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210032306/http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insured/index.html |date=December 10, 2007 }}</ref> which sets forth the general characteristics of FDIC deposit insurance, and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance.<ref name="fdic.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/information/fdiciorn.html |title=FDIC: Insured or Not Insured? |publisher=Fdic.gov |access-date=2011-09-15}}</ref>

==Items not insured==
Only the above types of accounts are insured. Some types of uninsured products, even if purchased through a covered financial institution, are:<ref name="fdic.gov"/>
* [[Stock]]s, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and [[mutual fund]]s including [[money fund]]s
** The [[Securities Investor Protection Corporation]], a separate institution chartered by Congress, provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a ''brokerage failure,'' but ''not'' against ''losses on the investments.''
** Further, as of September 19, 2008, the [[United States Treasury]] is offering an ''optional'' insurance program for money market funds, which guarantees the value of the assets.<ref>{{cite news

** Exceptions have occurred, such as the FDIC bailout of bondholders of [[Continental Illinois]].
* Investments backed by the U.S. government, such as [[United States Treasury security|Treasury securities]]
* The contents of [[safe deposit box]]es.
*: Even though the word deposit appears in the name, under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account&nbsp;– it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer.
* Losses due to [[theft]] or [[fraud]] at the institution.
*: These situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance companies.
* Accounting errors.
*: In these situations, there may be remedies for consumers under state contract law, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], and some federal regulations, depending on the type of transaction.
* [[Insurance]] and [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] products, such as [[life insurance|life]], [[auto insurance|auto]] and [[homeowner's insurance]].
