In response to Donald Trump's August 2019 interest in purchasing Greenland, Kielsen said that the proposal was "not something to joke about", and "Greenland is not Danish. Greenland is Greenlandic. I persistently hope that this is not something that is seriously meant."<ref>Lee, Matthew And Olsen, Jan.
