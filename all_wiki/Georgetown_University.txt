'''Georgetown University''' is a [[private university|private]] [[research university]] in the [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]] Founded by Bishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] in 1789 as [[Georgetown College (Georgetown University)|Georgetown College]], the university has grown to comprise ten [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] schools, among which are the [[School of Foreign Service]], [[McDonough School of Business|School of Business]], [[Georgetown University School of Medicine|Medical School]], [[Georgetown University Law Center|Law School]], and a [[Georgetown University in Qatar|campus in Qatar]]. On a hill above the [[Potomac River]], the school's main campus is identifiable by its flagship [[Healy Hall]], a [[National Historic Landmark]].

Georgetown is the oldest [[Catholic]] and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] institution of higher education in the United States. The Jesuits have participated in the university's academic life, both as scholars and as administrators, since 1805. However, the university has always been governed independently of the church, and the majority of Georgetown students are not Catholic.<ref name="SCU">{{cite web |url=http://www.studentcommissionforunity.org/scu-resources/student-commission-for-unity-publications/ |title=Final Report and Recommendations |date=January 2009 |work=Student Commission for Unity |publisher=Georgetown University |access-date=December 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408112708/http://www.studentcommissionforunity.org/scu-resources/student-commission-for-unity-publications/ |archive-date=April 8, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Engshuber, Laura.

===Founding===
[[File:John Carroll Gilbert Stuart.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]], the founder of Georgetown University|alt=A painting of an elderly man seated wearing a long gray robe.]]
[[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] settlers from England founded the [[Province of Maryland]] in 1634.<ref name=jstor>{{cite journal |title=Miniatures of Georgetown, 1634 to 1934 |first1=Edward A. |last1=Fitzpatrick |journal=The Journal of Higher Education |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=January 1936 |pages=56–57 |doi=10.2307/1974310 |last2=Nevils |first2=William Coleman |jstor=1974310 |publisher=[[Ohio State University Press]]}}</ref> In 1646, the defeat of the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] in the [[English Civil War]] led to stringent laws against Roman Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including missionary [[Andrew White (missionary)|Andrew White]], and the destruction of their school at Calverton Manor.<ref name=Nevils>{{harvnb|Nevils|1934|pp=1–25}}</ref> During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. It was not until after the end of the [[American Revolution]] that plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized.<ref name=ce>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06458a.htm |title=Georgetown University |encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |year=1909 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |first=E.I. |last=Devitt |access-date=July 10, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701232855/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06458a.htm |archive-date=July 1, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Because of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s recommendation, [[Pope Pius VI]] appointed former Jesuit [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] as the first [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|head of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States]], even though the papal [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppression of the Jesuit order]] was still in effect. Carroll began meetings of local clergy in 1783 near [[Annapolis, Maryland]], where they orchestrated the development of a new university.<ref name=ben/> On January 23, 1789, Carroll finalized the purchase of the property in Georgetown on which Dahlgren Quadrangle was later built.<ref name=loyola/> Future Congressman [[William Gaston]] was enrolled as the school's first student on November 22, 1791, and instruction began on January 2, 1792.<ref name=ben>{{harvnb|Curran|1993|pp=33–34}}</ref>
[[File:Proposal to establish George-Town Academy (Georgetown University) - 1787.jpg|thumb|left|The proposal for a school at Georgetown was conceived in 1787, after the [[American Revolution]] allowed for the free practice of religion.]]
During its early years, Georgetown College suffered from considerable financial strain.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=12}}</ref> The Maryland Society of Jesus began its restoration in 1805, and Jesuit affiliation, in the form of teachers and administrators, bolstered confidence in the college.<ref name=bulletin>{{cite web |url=http://www12.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/guhistory.html |title=Georgetown: A Brief History |first=Robert Emmett |last=Curran |website=Georgetown University – Undergraduate Bulletin |date=July 7, 2007 |access-date=August 27, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524191008/http://www12.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/guhistory.html |archive-date=May 24, 2007}}</ref> The school relied on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local lands which had been donated to the Jesuits. To raise money for Georgetown and other schools in 1838, Maryland Jesuits conducted a [[1838 Jesuit slave sale|mass sale]] of some 272 slaves to two Deep South plantations in [[Maringouin, Louisiana]], from their six in Maryland, ending their slaveholding.<ref>[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/schloesser/jesuitmoderns/w01/resources/MURPHY_Jesuit-slave.pdf Thomas Murphy, SJ.

In response to the demand for a local option for Roman Catholic students, the [[Georgetown University School of Medicine|Medical School]] was founded in 1851.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://som.georgetown.edu/docs/History.pdf |work=[[Georgetown University School of Medicine]] |title=History |date=March 23, 2008 |access-date=March 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104031715/http://som.georgetown.edu/docs/History.pdf |archive-date=November 4, 2009 }}</ref>

===Post-Civil War expansion===
The [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]] greatly affected Georgetown as 1,141&nbsp;students and alumni enlisted in one army or the other, and the [[Union Army]] commandeered university buildings.<ref name=ce/> By the time of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400&nbsp;troops were living in temporary quarters there. Due to the number of lives lost in the war, enrollment levels remained low until well after the war. Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|pp=36–39}}</ref> When the Georgetown College Boat Club, the school's [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] team, was founded in 1876 it adopted two colors: blue, used for [[Uniform of the Union Army|Union uniforms]], and gray, used for [[Uniforms of the Confederate States military forces|Confederate uniforms]]. These colors signified the peaceful unity among students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoyasaxa.com/sports/colors.htm|title=Georgetown Traditions: The Blue & Gray|website=HoyaSaxa.com|access-date=April 26, 2007|date=August 17, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427094307/http://www.hoyasaxa.com/sports/colors.htm|archive-date=April 27, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Subsequently, the school adopted these as its official colors.

Enrollment did not recover until during the presidency of [[Patrick Francis Healy]] from 1873 to 1881. Born in Georgia as a slave by law and [[mixed-race]] by ancestry, Healy was the first head of a predominantly white American university of acknowledged [[African American|African descent]].{{efn|name=healy}} He identified as Irish Catholic, like his father, and was educated in Catholic schools in the United States and France. He is credited with reforming the undergraduate [[curriculum]], lengthening the medical and law programs, and creating the [[Alumni association|Alumni Association]]. One of his largest undertakings was the construction of a major new building, subsequently named [[Healy Hall]] in his honor. For his work, Healy is known as the school's "second founder."<ref name=pfh>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jul31.html|title=Patrick Francis Healy Inaugurated|work=American Memory|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=July 31, 2006|access-date=July 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709184747/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jul31.html|archive-date=July 9, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the founding of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on [[higher education]].<ref name="bulletin" /> The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate [[School of Nursing and Health Studies|School of Nursing]] in 1903.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=2938|title=Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies Appoints New Director of Development|date=July 30, 2003|access-date=April 26, 2007|first=Lindsey|last=Spindle|department=Office of Communications|website=Georgetown University|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321040441/http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=2938|archive-date=March 21, 2007}}</ref> [[Georgetown Preparatory School]] relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the university in 1927.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://contentdm.lndlibrary.org/u?/gtown,13 |title=Third Grammar Class, Second Section, on the steps of Healy Hall at Georgetown University |website=Loyola Notre Dame Library |access-date=September 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142211/http://contentdm.lndlibrary.org/u?%2Fgtown%2C13 |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref> The [[Edmund A.

Besides expansion of the university, Georgetown also aimed to expand its resources and student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, and most of the university classes were made available to women on a limited basis by 1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide17.html|website=Georgetown University – About Georgetown|title=Georgetown University history: Co-Ed|access-date=July 17, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103023223/http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide17.html|archive-date=January 3, 2008}}</ref> With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female students in the 1969–1970 [[academic year]], Georgetown became fully [[coeducation]]al.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/areen-outlines-women-s-role-1.1887300|title=Areen Outlines Women's Role|date=April 1, 2003|access-date=May 1, 2011|work=[[The Hoya]]|first=Nick|last=Timiraos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118223834/http://www.thehoya.com/areen-outlines-women-s-role-1.1887300|archive-date=January 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 2002, Georgetown University began studying the feasibility of opening a campus of the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] in [[Qatar]], when the non-profit [[Qatar Foundation]] first proposed the idea.

Georgetown University has four campuses in Washington, D.C.: the undergraduate campus located in the neighborhood of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], the [[Georgetown University Medical Center|Medical Center]], the School of Continuing Studies (in Chinatown) and the Law Center. The undergraduate campus and Medical Center are together in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown neighborhood]] in the [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest Quadrant]] of Washington and form the main campus. Other centers are located around Washington, D.C., including the Center for Continuing and Professional Education at [[Clarendon, Arlington, Virginia|Clarendon]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. Transit between these locations and the [[Washington Metro]] is supplied by a system of shuttles, known as GUTS buses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://otm.georgetown.edu/guts/index.cfm|title=Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle (GUTS)|publisher=Georgetown University|year=2011|access-date=May 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719201847/http://otm.georgetown.edu/guts/index.cfm|archive-date=July 19, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Georgetown also has a branch of the [[Georgetown University in Qatar|School of Foreign Service]] in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].

===Main campus===
Georgetown's undergraduate and medical school campuses are situated on an elevated site above the [[Potomac River]] overlooking [[Northern Virginia]]. Because of this, Georgetown University is often referred to as "The Hilltop." The main gates, known as the ''Healy Gates'', are located at the intersection of 37th and O Streets NW, and lead directly to the heart of campus. The main campus is relatively compact, being {{convert|104|acre|km2|1}} in area, but includes fifty-four buildings, student residences and apartments capable of accommodating 80% of undergraduates, and various athletic facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgetown.edu/about/key-facts/index.html|title=Georgetown Key Facts|work=Georgetown University|year=2011|access-date=February 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524200107/http://www.georgetown.edu/about/key-facts/index.html|archive-date=May 24, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Most buildings employ [[collegiate Gothic]] architecture and [[Georgian architecture|Georgian brick architecture]].

The medical school is located in the northwestern part of the main campus on Reservoir Road, and is integrated with [[Georgetown University Hospital]].<ref name=map/> The Medical campus includes the historic Medical-Dental Building, the Dahlgren Memorial Library, and other research and classroom facilities.

In the last decade, the West side of the Hilltop has emerged as a newly developing area of the main campus. The university completed the Southwest Quadrangle Project in late 2003 and brought a new 907-bed upperclassmen residence hall, the Leo J. O'Donovan dining hall, a large underground parking facility, and a new Jesuit Residence to the campus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/news/082203/news1.cfm|title=From Hole to Home, Southwest Quad Completed|work=[[The Hoya]]|first=Nick|last=Timiraos|date=August 22, 2003|access-date=May 7, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024043935/http://www.thehoya.com/news/082203/news1.cfm|archive-date=October 24, 2007}}</ref> The school's first [[performing arts center]], named for [[Royden B.

O'Donovan dining hall in 2003.

The school's teams are called "Hoyas", a name whose origin is uncertain.
