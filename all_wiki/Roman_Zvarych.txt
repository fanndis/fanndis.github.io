'''Roman Mykhailovych Zvarych''' ({{lang-ua|Роман Михайлович Зварич}}; born 1953) is a Ukrainian politician. A [[list of former United States citizens who relinquished their nationality|former United States citizen]], he was one of the first people to [[relinquishment of United States nationality|relinquish that citizenship]] in order to take up Ukrainian citizenship after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].<ref name="UkrainianWeekly19980524">{{cite news|url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1998/219809.shtml|first=Roman|last=Woronowycz|title=Roman Zvarych, former New Yorker, now Ukrainian parliamentarian|work=The Ukrainian Weekly|date=1998-05-24|accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref>

==Early life==
Zvarych was born in [[Yonkers, New York]] to Soviet [[émigré]] parents who came to the United States during World War II.<ref name="UkrainianWeekly19980524"/> In later interviews, he says that at age fifteen he swore an oath to "achieve Ukrainian statehood or ... die fighting for it".<ref name="UkrainianWeekly20050515">{{cite news|url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2005/200502.shtml|first=Zenon|last=Zawada|title=Zvarych sees campaign to force his resignation, suspects diaspora, others|work=The Ukrainian Weekly|date=2005-05-15|accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref> In 1976 he earned a B.A. with honors from [[Manhattan College]] in [[Bronx, New York]].<ref name="UkrainianWeekly_2">{{cite news|url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2005/190503.shtml|first=Zenon|last=Zawada|title=Yushchenko administration's first 100 days incorporate promises made on maidan|work=The Ukrainian Weekly|date=2005-05-08|accessdate=2013-02-23|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201175725/http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2005/190503.shtml|archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref>

==Emigration to Ukraine and political career==
Zvarych moved to Ukraine in 1991 with the intention of pursuing an academic career, but soon after became involved in politics.<ref name="UkrainianWeekly20050515"/> In 1992, he and [[Slava Stetsko]] founded the [[Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists]], a right-wing party.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_QMCypjpXwC&pg=PA197|authorlink=Andrew Wilson (historian)|first=Andrew|last=Wilson|title=Ukrainian Nationalism in the 1990s: A Minority Faith|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1996|isbn=0521574579|page=197}}</ref> He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1995.<ref name="EDM20050504">{{cite news|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=30347|first=Taras|last=Kuzio|title=More problems for Yushchenko government as Justice Minister caught exaggerating his academic record|work=Eurasia Daily Monitor|volume=2|issue=87|date=2005-05-04|accessdate=2012-05-13}}</ref> Along with fellow politician [[Ivan Lozowy]] this made him one of the first former Americans to renounce U.S. citizenship in favour of Ukrainian citizenship.<ref name="UkrainianWeekly19980524"/> A notification confirming his loss of citizenship appeared in the ''[[Federal Register]]'' in June 1997 with his name listed as "Roman Mychajlo Zwarycz".<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/1997/07/22/97-19050/quarterly-publication-of-individuals-who-have-chosen-to-expatriate-as-required-by-section-6039f|author=Doug Rogers, Internal Revenue Service|title=Quarterly Publication of Individuals, Who Have Chosen to Expatriate, As Required by Section 6039(f)|work=Federal Register|volume=69|page=39305|date=1997-07-22|accessdate=2013-02-25}}</ref>

Zwarych ran for a seat in the [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1994 election]] for a single-mandate seat representing a district of [[Kyiv]] in the [[Verkhovna Rada]], and received 70% of the vote but was not elected due to his failure to meet the [[voter turnout]] threshold of 50% mandated by the electoral law at the time. He was eventually elected in the [[1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1998 election]] from a [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list proportional]] district.<ref name="UkrainianWeekly19980524"/> Thereafter he sat in the Verkhovna Rada for six years, serving on various committees including the Committee on Legal Reform and the Committee on European Integration. Outside of the Verkhovna Rada he also moonlighted as a lawyer; Ukrainian courts had no requirement for practitioners of law to hold certifications or pass a bar examination. On one occasion Zvarych successfully defended a family against eviction. More importantly, during the [[Orange Revolution]] in the midst of the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 presidential election]], he successfully argued a case on behalf of [[Viktor Yushchenko]] to prevent the creation of Ukrainian voting districts for [[Ukrainians in Russia]].<ref name="UkrainianWeekly20050515"/>

In February 2005, with Yushchenko having emerged victorious in the election, he appointed Zvarych to head the [[Ministry of Justice (Ukraine)|Ministry of Justice]].<ref name="UkrainianWeekly20050515"/> In April 2005, articles in ''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'' and other media outlets accused Zvarych of lying about holding a Ph.D. from Columbia University. A spokesperson for the university had confirmed to a ''Ukrayinska Pravda'' reporter that no person by his name had earned a degree there.<ref name="EDM20050504"/> Zvarych called a press conference the following month in which he admitted the truth of the accusations about the Ph.D.; in his clarifying remarks, he claimed to have been an "[[all but dissertation]]" student and to have worked as an adjunct lecturer at Columbia University, being informally referred to by colleagues and students as "professor" without having held that academic rank. He accused the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] and  the [[Komsomol of Ukraine]] of orchestrating a political smear campaign to blow the misunderstanding out of proportion.<ref name="UkrainianWeekly20050515"/>

In the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] Zvarych was a candidate of [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc]]; placed 82nd on the electoral list.<ref>[http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2014/09/19/7038339/ Party list of Petro Poroshenko Bloc], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (September 19, 2014)</ref> But the party only won 63 seats on the electoral list; hence he was not (re-)elected into parliament.<ref>[http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/poroshenko_bloc_to_have_greatest_number_of_seats_in_parliament_327072 Poroshenko Bloc to have greatest number of seats in parliament], [[Ukrinform]] (8 November 2014)<br />[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233404.html People's Front 0.33% ahead of Poroshenko Bloc with all ballots counted in Ukraine elections - CEC], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (8 November 2014)<br />[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233426.html Poroshenko Bloc to get 132 seats in parliament - CEC], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (8 November 2014)</ref> But he returned to parliament nevertheless on 15 March 2018 to take the place of [[Valery Pakzkan]] who was just elected head of the [[Accounting Chamber of Ukraine]].<ref>https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2018/03/15/7174743/</ref>
