'''Jean-Michel Basquiat''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ miʃɛl baskja|lang}}; December 22, 1960 – August 12, 1988) was an American artist of [[Haitian Americans|Haitian]] and [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] descent. Basquiat first achieved fame as part of [[SAMO]], an informal [[graffiti]] duo who wrote enigmatic [[epigram]]s in the cultural hotbed of the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] during the late 1970s, where [[rap]], [[punk visual art|punk]], and [[street art]] coalesced into early [[hip-hop music]] culture. By the early 1980s, his [[Neo-expressionism|neo-expressionist]] paintings were being exhibited in galleries and museums internationally. At 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist to ever take part in ''[[Documenta]]'' in [[Kassel]]. At 22, he was the youngest to exhibit at the [[Whitney Biennial]] in New York. The [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] held a retrospective of his art in 1992.

Basquiat's art focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, [[Abstract art|abstraction]], [[Figurative art|figuration]], and historical information mixed with contemporary critique. Basquiat used [[social commentary]] in his paintings as a tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the black community of his time, as well as attacks on [[Power (social and political)|power structures]] and systems of racism. Basquiat's visual poetics were acutely [[Political criticism|political]] and direct in their criticism of [[colonialism]] and support for [[Class conflict|class struggle]]. 

Since his death [[27 Club|at the age of 27]] from a [[opioid overdose|heroin overdose]] in 1988, his work has steadily increased in value. At a [[Sotheby's]] auction in May 2017, ''[[Untitled (1982 painting)|Untitled]]'', a 1982 painting by Basquiat depicting a black skull with red and yellow rivulets, sold for $110.5 million, becoming one of the [[List of most expensive paintings#List%20of%20highest%20prices%20paid|most expensive paintings]] ever purchased. It also set a new record high for an American artist at auction.

===Heroes and saints===
A prominent theme in the early Basquiat portrayed historically prominent black figures, such as [[Charlie Parker]], who were identified by Basquiat as black heroes and saints. These were often identified with the iconographic depiction of crowns and halos to distinguish heroes and saints in Basquiat's specially chosen pantheon. As the ''Art Daily'' described Basquiat's show in the Bilbao Guggenheim: "The show is divided into eight different sections on the Museum's third floor and begins in Gallery 305, where his earliest creations are displayed under two themes: 'Street as Studio" and 'Heroes and Saints'. The urban landscape inspired the subject matter, approach, and materials used in these pieces".<ref>Art Daily. "'Jean-Michel Basquiat: Now's the Time' on view at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao."

Basquiat drew constantly, and often used objects around him as surfaces when paper was not immediately at hand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/24/jean-michel-basquiat-boom-for-real-barbican-review|title=Basquiat: Boom for Real review – restless energy|last=Cumming|first=Laura|date=September 24, 2017|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/jean-michel-basquiat|title=Jean-Michel Basquiat facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Jean-Michel Basquiat|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> Since childhood, Basquiat produced cartoon-inspired drawings when encouraged by his mother's interest in art, and drawing became a part of his expression as an artist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/new-york/articles/the-art-of-jean-michel-basquiat-legacy-of-a-cultural-icon/|title=The Art of Jean-Michel Basquiat: Legacy of a Cultural Icon|last=Steel|first=Rebecca|work=Culture Trip|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> Basquiat's drawings were produced in many different media, most commonly ink, pencil, felt-tip or marker, and oil-stick.<ref name="pbs" /> Basquiat sometimes used [[Xerox art|Xerox]] copies of fragments of his drawings to paste on to the canvas of larger paintings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/1988/11/jean-michel-basquiat|title=Jean-Michel Basquiat|last=Haden-Guest|first=Anthony|access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref>

The first public showing of Basquiat's paintings and drawings was in 1981 at the [[MoMA PS1]] ''New York/New Wave'' exhibit. The article in ''Artforum'' magazine entitled "Radiant Child" written by [[Rene Ricard]] after seeing the show brought Basquiat to the attention of the art world.<ref>{{cite book|title=100 Contemporary Artists A-Z|last1=Holzwarth|first1=Hans W.|date=2009|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8365-1490-3|edition=Taschen's 25th anniversary special|location=Köln|pages=54–61}}</ref> In 1984, Basquiat immortalized Ricard in two drawings, ''Untitled (Axe/Rene)'' and ''Rene Ricard'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/jean-michel-basquiat/ren%C3%A9-ricard-bMzTQnaq9prDP3vOWQal6g2|title=Rene Ricard by Jean-MichelBasquiat|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=March 1, 2018}}</ref> representing the tension that existed between them.

A poet as well as an artist, words featured heavily in his drawings and paintings, with direct references to racism, slavery, the people and street scene of 1980s New York including other artists, and black historical figures, musicians and sports stars, as his notebooks and many important drawings demonstrate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.artforum.com/print/201504/jean-michel-basquiat-50730|title=Glenn O'Brien on the notebooks and drawings of Jean-Michel Basquiat|website=www.artforum.com|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wallpaper.com/art/inner-workings-the-notebooks-of-jean-michel-basquiat-are-unveiled-at-the-brooklyn-museum|title=Inner workings: the notebooks of Jean-Michel Basquiat are unveiled at the Brooklyn Museum|last=Magazine|first=Wallpaper*|date=April 7, 2015|work=Wallpaper*|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> Often Basquiat's drawings were untitled, and as such to differentiate works a word written within the drawing is commonly in parentheses after ''Untitled'', such as with ''Untitled (Axe/Rene)''.

===Heads===
[[File:Untitled acrylic and mixed media on canvas by --Jean-Michel Basquiat--, 1984.jpg|thumb|''Untitled (Skull)'' (1981)]]

Heads and skulls are seen as significant focal points of many of Basquiat's most seminal works.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|last=Lee|first=Shannon|date=2020-07-09|title=Why Basquiat's Heads Are His Most Sought-After Works|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-basquiats-heads-sought-after-works|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Artsy|language=en}}</ref> They are reminiscent of [[African masks]], which suggests a cultural reclamation. The skulls also allude to [[Haitian Vodou]], which is filled with skull symbolism. Two pieces, ''Untitled (Skull)'' (1981'')'' and ''[[Untitled (1982 painting)|Untitled]]'' (1982'')'', can be seen as primary examples.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/19/jean-michel-basquiat-110m-sothebys|title=Is this Basquiat worth $110m?

===Heritage===
{{quote box |width=20em |quote =  Like a DJ, Basquiat adeptly reworked [[Neo-expressionism]]'s clichéd language of gesture, freedom, and angst and redirected [[Pop art]]'s strategy of appropriation to produce a body of work that at times celebrated [[African-American culture|black culture]] and [[African-American history|history]] but also revealed its complexity and contradictions.|source= —Lydia Lee<ref name = "Sirmans" />}}

Basquiat's diverse cultural heritage was one of his many sources of inspiration. He often incorporated Spanish words into his artworks such as ''[[La Hara (1981 painting)|La Hara]]'' (1981), a menacing portrait of a white police officer, titled after the [[Nuyorican]] slang term for police, la jara. The black-hatted figure that appears in his paintings ''The Guilt of Gold Teeth'' (1982) and ''Despues De Un Pun'' (1987) is believed to represent [[Baron Samedi]], the chief of the [[Guédé]] family of spirits in Haitian Vodou.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saggese|first=Jordana Moore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1UlDQAAQBAJ&q=Baron+Samedi+basquiat&pg=PA56|title=Reading Basquiat: Exploring Ambivalence in American Art|date=2014-05-30|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27624-6|pages=56|language=en}}</ref>

Basquiat has various works deriving from [[African-American history]], like ''Slave Auction'' (1982), ''[[Undiscovered Genius of the Mississippi Delta]]'' (1983), and ''[[Untitled (History of the Black People)]]'' (1983).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-01|title=Iconic Artworks: Basquiat's Undiscovered Genius of the Mississippi Delta|url=https://magazine.artland.com/iconic-artworks-basquiats-undiscovered-genius-of-the-mississippi-delta/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=Artland Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref> Another Basquiat artwork, ''[[Irony of Negro Policeman]]'' (1981), is intended to illustrate how he believes African-Americans have been controlled by a predominantly [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] society. Basquiat sought to portray that African-Americans have become complicit with the "institutionalized forms of whiteness and corrupt white regimes of power" years after the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow era]] had ended.<ref name="Frohne1999">{{citation|last=Frohne|first=Andrea|title=The African Diaspora: African Origins and New World Identities|date=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkUZqSBlXM4C|pages=439–451|author-link=Isidore Okpewho|editor1-last=Okpewho|editor1-first=Isidore|chapter=Representing Jean-Michel Basquiat|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkUZqSBlXM4C&pg=PA441|edition=1st|location=Bloomington, Indiana|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-33425-1|editor2=[[Carole Boyce Davies]]|editor3=[[Ali Mazrui|Ali Al'Amin Mazrui]]|mode=cs1}}</ref> This concept has been reiterated in additional Basquiat works, including [https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-michel-basquiat/created-equal-1984 ''Created Equal''] (1984). However, Kellie Jones, in her essay "Lost in Translation: Jean-Michel in the (Re)Mix," posits that Basquiat's "mischievous, complex, and [[Neologism|neologistic]] side, with regard to the fashioning of modernity and the influence and effluence of black culture" are often elided by critics and viewers, and thus "lost in translation."<ref name="Jones">''Lost in Translation: Jean-Michel in the (Re)Mix'', by Kellie Jones, from the book ''Basquiat'', edited by Marc Mayer, 2005, Merrell Publishers in association with the Brooklyn Museum, {{ISBN|978-1-85894-287-2}}, pp. 163–179.</ref> The art historian [[Olivier Berggruen]] situates in Basquiat's anatomical screen prints, titled ''Anatomy,'' an assertion of vulnerability, one which "creates an aesthetic of the body as damaged, scarred, fragmented, incomplete, or torn apart, once the organic whole has disappeared. Paradoxically, it is the very act of creating these representations that conjures a positive corporeal valence between the artist and his sense of self or identity."<ref>{{cite book|last=Berggruen|first=Olivier|author-link=Olivier Berggruen|chapter=Some Notes on Jean-Michel Basquiat's Silk-Screen Prints|page=127|title=The Writing of Art|publisher=Pushkin Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-906548-62-9}}</ref>

==Reception, exhibitions, and art market==
===Reception===
Traditionally, the interpretation of Basquiat's works at the visual level comes from the subdued emotional tone of what they represent compared to what is actually depicted. For example, the figures in his paintings, as stated by [[Stephen Metcalf (writer)|Stephen Metcalf]], "are shown frontally, with little or no depth of field, and nerves and organs are exposed, as in an anatomy textbook. Are these creatures dead and being clinically dissected, one wonders, or alive and in immense pain?"<ref>Stephen Metcalf (Jul 30, 2018), [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/jean-michel-basquiat-artist-or-celebrity/561728/ The Enigma of the Man Behind the $110 Million Painting] ''[[The Atlantic]]''.</ref> In a similar vein, Jordana Moore Saggese states the action represented in the paintings of Basquiat have been referred to as a tribute to jazz indicating that, "Parker, Gillespie, and the other musicians of the bebop era infamously appropriated both the harmonic structures of jazz standards, using them as a structure for their own songs, and repeated similar note patterns across several improvisations."<ref>Jordana Moore Saggese (Jun 30, 2015), [https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/modernity-ap/a/basquiat-horn-players Basquiat, Horn Players] ''[[Khan Academy]]''.</ref>

A second recurrent reference to Basquiat's aesthetics comes from the artist intention to share, in the words of Niru Ratnum, a "highly individualistic, expressive view of the world".<ref>Niru Ratnam (Nov 16, 2013), [https://www.spectator.co.uk/2013/11/collectors-love-him-critics-hate-him-what-do-you-think-of-jean-michel-basquiat/ Do you think this painting is worth $48.4 million?] ''[[The Spectator]]''.</ref> [[David Bowie]], a collector of Basquiat's works, stated that "He seemed to digest the frenetic flow of passing image and experience, put them through some kind of internal reorganization and dress the canvas with this resultant network of chance."<ref>Ekow eshun (Sep 25, 2017), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/bowie-bach-and-bebop-how-music-powered-basquiat-a7966541.html Bowie, Bach and Bebop: How music powered Basquiat] ''[[The Independent|Independent]]''.</ref> Basquiat seems to invite us to, in the words of Luis Alberto Mejia Clavijo, "paint like a child, don't paint what is on the surface... Finally every energy you drop is marking a territory, is a traffic sign, is directing and feeding spirits. What seems like a mess for some of us in the Cartesian logic, it is maybe a clear spiritual route for some others."<ref>Luis Alberto Mejia Clavijo (Jul 11, 2012), [https://luissioamclavijo.blogspot.com/2012/07/voodoo-child-ernok-of-jean-michel.html Voodoo Child: Ernok of Jean Michel Basquiat] ''Contemporary Art Theory''.</ref> Fred Hoffman stated that a painting from Basquiat typically "shows the artist's vitality and energy being continually challenged by life-draining organisms."<ref>Fred Hoffman (Dec 22, 2013), [https://www.americansuburbx.com/2013/12/five-key-basquiat-works.html Notes on Five Key Jean-Michel Basquiat Works] ''American Suburb X''.</ref> Reviews about his work have been written on the direct relation of painting and graffiti. Regarding the relation between painting and graffiti, [[Olivia Laing]] states: "Words jumped out at him, from the back of cereal boxes or subway ads, and he stayed alert to their subversive properties, their double and hidden meaning."<ref>Olivia Laing (Sep 8, 2017), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/08/race-power-money-the-art-of-jean-michel-basquiat Race, power, money – the art of Jean-Michel Basquiat] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>

In the words of the [[Marc Mayer]] essay "Basquiat in History", "Basquiat speaks articulately while dodging the full impact of clarity like a [[Torero|matador]]. We can read his pictures without strenuous effort—the words, the images, the colors and the construction—but we cannot quite fathom the point they belabor. Keeping us in this state of half-knowing, of mystery-within-familiarity, had been the core technique of his brand of communication since his adolescent days as the graffiti poet SAMO. To enjoy them, we are not meant to analyze the pictures too carefully. Quantifying the encyclopedic breadth of his research certainly results in an interesting inventory, but the sum cannot adequately explain his pictures, which requires an effort outside the purview of [[iconography]] ... he painted a calculated incoherence, calibrating the mystery of what such apparently meaning-laden pictures might ultimately mean."<ref>''Basquiat'', edited by Marc Mayer, 2005, Merrell Publishers in association with the Brooklyn Museum, {{ISBN|978-1-85894-287-2}}, p. 50.</ref>

===Exhibitions===
Basquiat's first public exhibition in June 1980 was in the group effort ''The Times Square Show'' (with [[David Hammons]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Lee Quiñones]], [[Kenny Scharf]] and [[Kiki Smith]] among others), held in a vacant building at 41st Street and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] in New York.

===Criticism===
In a review for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', critic [[Hilton Kramer]] begins his first paragraph by stating that Basquiat had no idea what the word "quality" meant. The criticisms to follow relentlessly label Basquiat as a "talentless hustler" and a "street-smart but otherwise invincibly ignorant" arguing that art dealers of the time were "as ignorant about art as Basquiat himself." In saying that Basquiat's work never rose above "that lowly artistic station" of graffiti "even when his paintings were fetching enormous prices," Kramer argued that graffiti art "acquired a cult status in certain New York art circles." Kramer further opined that "As a result of the campaign waged by these art-world entrepreneurs on Basquiat's behalf—and their own, of course—there was never any doubt that the museums, the collectors and the media would fall into line" when talking about the marketing of Basquiat's name.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4707974/He-had-everything-but-talent.html|title=He had everything but talent|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=March 22, 1997|access-date=December 5, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

According to Sirmans, Basquiat's visual poetics were acutely [[Political criticism|political]] and direct in their criticism of [[colonialism]] and support for [[Class conflict|class struggle]].<ref name = "Sirmans" /> As reviewed by Hoffman, Basquiat used [[social commentary]] in his paintings as a "springboard to deeper truths about the individual".<ref name = "Hoffman" /> Art critic Bonnie Rosenberg compared Basquiat's work to the emergence of American Hip Hop during the same era. She also mentioned how Basquiat experienced a good taste of fame in his last years when he was a "critically embraced and popularly celebrated artistic phenomenon."

The single received attention after American rapper and producer Jay-Z dressed up as Basquiat for Halloween the same year as the release giving revelation a nod.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2014/11/jay-z-and-beyonce-dressed-up-as-jean-michel-basquiat-and-frida-kahlo-for-halloween|title=Jay Z and Beyoncé Dressed Up as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Frida Kahlo for Halloween|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jean-michel-basquiat-mn0000651659|title=Jean-Michel Basquiat {{!}} Album Discography|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>
