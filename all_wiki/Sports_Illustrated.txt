'''''Sports Illustrated''''' ('''''SI''''') is an American [[sports]] [[magazine]] owned by [[Authentic Brands Group]], and was first published in August 1954. 

It was the first magazine with circulation over one million to win the National Magazine Award for General Excellence twice. It is also known for its annual [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue|swimsuit issue]], which has been published since 1964, and has spawned other complementary media works and products.

In 2018, the magazine was sold to [[Meredith Corporation]] by means of its acquisition of parent company [[Time Inc.]], but Meredith stated that it planned to sell ''Sports Illustrated'' as it did not align with its lifestyle properties. The following year, Meredith announced that it would sell ''Sports Illustrated'' to Authentic Brands Group. While Meredith initially planned to continue publishing its print and digital properties under license from ABG (who planned to leverage the ''Sports Illustrated'' brand in other markets), ABG later announced that it would instead give the publishing rights to theMaven, Inc.—a digital media company.

==History==

There were two magazines named ''Sports Illustrated'' before the current magazine began on August 9, 1954.<ref name=mfloss>{{cite news|first=Alex|last=French|title=The Very First Issues of 19 Famous Magazines|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/50299/very-first-issues-19-famous-magazines|magazine=[[Mental Floss]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|location=London, England|date=August 9, 2013|access-date=August 10, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810181820/http://mentalfloss.com/article/50299/very-first-issues-19-famous-magazines|archive-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In 1936, Stuart Scheftel created ''Sports Illustrated'' with a target market for sportsman. He published the magazine from 1936 to 1938 on a monthly basis. The magazine focused on golf, tennis, and skiing with articles on the major sports. He then sold the name to Dell Publications, which released ''Sports Illustrated'' in 1949 and this version lasted six issues before closing. Dell's version focused on major sports (baseball, basketball, boxing) and competed on magazine racks against ''Sport'' and other monthly sports magazines. During the 1940s these magazines were monthly and they did not cover the current events because of the production schedules. There was no large-base, general, weekly sports magazine with a national following on actual active events. It was then that ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' patriarch [[Henry Luce]] began considering whether his company should attempt to fill that gap. At the time, many believed sports was beneath the attention of serious journalism and did not think sports news could fill a weekly magazine, especially during the winter. A number of advisers to Luce, including ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's Ernest Havemann, tried to kill the idea, but Luce, who was not a sports fan, decided the time was right.<ref>{{Harv|MacCambridge|1997|pages=17–25}}.</ref>

The goal of the new magazine was to be basically a magazine, but with sports. Many at Time-Life scoffed at Luce's idea; in his [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning biography, ''Luce and His Empire'', [[W. A. Swanberg]] wrote that the company's intellectuals dubbed the proposed magazine "Muscle", "Jockstrap", and "Sweat Socks". Launched on August 9, 1954, it was not profitable (and would not be so for 12 years)<ref>"Henry Luce and Time-Life's America: A Vision of Empire". ''[[American Masters]]'', April 28, 2004.</ref> and not particularly well run at first, but Luce's timing was good. The popularity of spectator sports in the United States was about to explode, and that popularity came to be driven largely by three things: economic prosperity, television, and ''Sports Illustrated''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacCambridge|first1=Michael|title=The Franchise: A History of Sports Illustrated Magazine|date=1998|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=9780786883578|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/maccambridge-franchise.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202033319/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/maccambridge-franchise.html|archivedate=February 2, 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Mark Ford David Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|thumb|Mark Ford, President of the Sports Illustrated Group in 2010]]

The early issues of the magazine seemed caught between two opposing views of its audience. Much of the subject matter was directed at upper-class activities such as [[yachting]], [[polo]] and [[safari]]s, but upscale would-be [[Advertising|advertisers]] were unconvinced that [[sports fan]]s were a significant part of their market.<ref>{{Harv|MacCambridge|1997|pp=6, 27, 42}}.</ref>

After more than a decade of steady losses, the magazine's fortunes finally turned around in the 1960s when [[Andre Laguerre]] became its managing editor. A European correspondent for Time, Inc., who later became chief of the Time-Life news bureaux in Paris and London (for a time he ran both simultaneously), Laguerre attracted Henry Luce's attention in 1956 with his singular coverage of the [[Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], Italy, which became the core of ''SI'''s coverage of those games. In May 1956, Luce brought Laguerre to New York to become the assistant managing editor of the magazine. He was named managing editor in 1960, and he more than doubled the circulation by instituting a system of departmental editors, redesigning the internal format,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://fiercesimplicity.com/ | title=Designer Swimwear | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214061746/http://www.fiercesimplicity.com/ | archivedate=February 14, 2015 }}</ref> and inaugurating the unprecedented use in a news magazine of full-color photographic coverage of the week's sports events. He was also one of the first to sense the rise of national interest in professional [[American football|football]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1094551/index.htm | work=Sports Illustrated | title=Letter From The Publisher | last=Sutton | first=Kelso F. | date=January 29, 1979 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104256/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1094551/index.htm | archivedate=May 11, 2011 }}</ref>

Laguerre also instituted the innovative concept of one long story at the end of every issue, which he called the "bonus piece". These well-written, in-depth articles helped to distinguish ''Sports Illustrated'' from other sports publications, and helped launch the careers of such legendary writers as [[Frank Deford]], who in March 2010 wrote of Laguerre, "He smoked cigars and drank Scotch and made the sun move across the heavens ... His genius as an editor was that he made you want to please him, but he wanted you to do that by writing in your own distinct way."<ref>Deford, Frank: "Sometimes the Bear Eats You: Confessions of a Sportswriter". ''Sports Illustrated'', March 29, 2010 pp. 52–62.</ref>

Laguerre is also credited with the conception and creation of the annual ''[[Swimsuit Issue]]'', which quickly became, and remains, the most popular issue each year.

In 1990, Time Inc. merged with [[Warner Communications]] to form the media conglomerate [[Time Warner]]. In 2014, Time Inc. was spun off from Time Warner. In November 2017, [[Meredith Corporation]] announced that it would acquire Time Inc., and the acquisition was completed in January 2018. However, in March 2018, Meredith stated that it would explore selling ''Sports Illustrated'' and several other former Time properties, arguing that they did not properly align with the company's lifestyle brands and publications.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/21/media/meredith-time-fortune-magazine-for-sale/index.html|title=Meredith is putting Sports Illustrated and Time magazines on the block|last2=Gold|first2=Hadas |first=Brian |last=Stelter |authorlink=Brian Stelter |date=March 21, 2018 |authorlink2=Hadas Gold |work=CNNMoney|access-date=March 29, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329121818/http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/21/media/meredith-time-fortune-magazine-for-sale/index.html|archivedate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

=== Sale to Authentic Brands Group, theMaven ===
On May 27, 2019, [[Authentic Brands Group]] announced its intent to acquire ''Sports Illustrated'' for $110 million. Authentic Brands Group will leverage its brand and other assets for new opportunities that "stay close to the DNA and the heritage of the brand." Upon announcement of the sale, it was stated that Meredith would enter into a licensing agreement to continue as publisher of the ''Sports Illustrated'' editorial operations for at least the next two years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/sports-illustrated-sold-to-authentic-brands-group-for-110-million-1202622959/|title=Sports Illustrated Sold To Authentic Brands Group For $110 Million|last=Bennett|first=Anita|date=2019-05-28|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/sports-illustrated-sale-meredith-authentic-brands-1203226481/|title=Meredith Sells Sports Illustrated to Authentic Brands Group for $110 Million|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2019-05-28|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref> However, on June 18, 2019, it was revealed that the rights to publish the ''Sports Illustrated'' editorial operations would be licensed to the digital media company theMaven, Inc. under a 10-year contract, with [[Ross Levinsohn]] as CEO.

==Innovations==

From its start, ''Sports Illustrated'' introduced a number of innovations that are generally taken for granted today:

*Liberal use of color photos—though the six-week lead time initially meant they were unable to depict timely subject matter
*Scouting reports—including a [[World Series]] Preview and [[New Year's Day]] [[bowl game]] round-up that enhanced the viewing of games on television
*In-depth sports reporting from writers like [[Robert Creamer]], [[Tex Maule]] and [[Dan Jenkins]].
*Regular illustration features by artists like [[Robert Riger]].
*High school football ''Player of the Month'' awards.
*Inserts of sports cards in the center of the magazine (1954 & 1955)
*1994 Launched Sports Illustrated Interactive CD-ROM with StarPress Multimedia, Incorporates player stats, video and highlights from the year in sports.
*In 2015 Sports Illustrated purchased a group of software companies and combined them to create Sports Illustrated Play, a platform that offers sports league management software as a service.

===Color printing===

In 1965, [[offset printing]] began. This allowed the color pages of the magazine to be printed overnight, not only producing crisper and brighter images, but also finally enabling the editors to merge the best color with the latest news. By 1967, the magazine was printing 200 pages of "fast color" a year; in 1983, ''SI'' became the first American full-color newsweekly. An intense rivalry developed between [[Photojournalism|photographers]], particularly [[Walter Iooss]] and [[Neil Leifer]], to get a decisive cover shot that would be on newsstands and in mailboxes only a few days later.<ref>{{Harv|MacCambridge|1997|pp=108–111, 139–141, 149–151, 236}}</ref>

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, during Gil Rogin's term as Managing Editor, the feature stories of [[Frank Deford]] became the magazine's anchor. "Bonus pieces" on [[Pete Rozelle]], [[Woody Hayes]], [[Bear Bryant]], [[Howard Cosell]] and others became some of the most quoted sources about these figures, and Deford established a reputation as one of the best writers of the time.<ref>{{Harv|MacCambridge|1997|pp=236–238}}.</ref>
