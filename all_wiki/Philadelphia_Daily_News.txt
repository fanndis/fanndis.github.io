The '''''Philadelphia Daily News''''' is a [[tabloid newspaper]] that serves [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. The newspaper is owned by [[Philadelphia Media Network]], which also owns Philadelphia's other major newspaper ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.

The ''Daily News'' began publishing on March 31, 1925, under founding editor Lee Ellmaker. By 1930, the newspaper's [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] exceeded 200,000, but by the 1950s the news paper was losing money. In 1954, the newspaper was sold to Matthew McCloskey and then sold again in 1957 to publisher [[Walter Annenberg]].

In 1969, Annenberg sold the ''Daily News'' to [[Knight Ridder]]. In 2006 Knight Ridder sold the paper to a group of local investors. The ''Daily News'' has won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] three times.

==History==
The ''Philadelphia Daily News'' began publishing on March 31, 1925, under founding editor Lee Ellmaker. In its early years, it was dominated by crime stories, sports and sensationalism. By 1930, daily [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of the morning paper exceeded 200,000. Circulation dropped over the years, and by 1954, the money-losing paper was sold to Matthew McCloskey, a contractor and treasurer of the [[Pennsylvania Democratic Party]]. In December 1956, the paper's financial condition was so bad that McCloskey got permission from the unions for a 90 percent cut in the workforce.

In 1957, McCloskey sold the paper to [[Walter Annenberg]], publisher of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. Annenberg killed off the ''Daily News''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Sunday edition and made the tabloid into an afternoon paper.

In 1969, Annenberg sold both papers to Knight Newspapers Inc., which eventually became [[Knight Ridder]] following a merger. Under the new ownership, the ''Daily News'' returned to morning publication and aimed to be taken more seriously. The paper's journalists have won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] three times. Richard Aregood won in [[1985 Pulitzer Prize|1985]] for [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing|editorial writing]], [[Signe Wilkinson]] won for her [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning|editorial cartoons]] in [[1992 Pulitzer Prize|1992]] and Barbara Laker and Wendy Ruderman won in [[2010 Pulitzer Prize|2010]] for [[Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting|investigating reporting]] for their "Tainted Justice" series focusing on the alleged misdeeds of a rogue narcotics squad.<ref>{{cite journal | first=David | last=O'Reilly | date=April 13, 2010 | title=Daily News wins Pulitzer Prize | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer | url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/homepage/90723149.html | accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref>

The paper continues to struggle financially. It was surpassed in circulation, but not readership, by the free daily ''[[Philadelphia Metro|Metro]]''. When the sale of Knight Ridder to [[The McClatchy Company]] was announced in March 2006, there were rumors that McClatchy would close the ''Daily News''. However, in May, before the sale was finalized, it was announced that the ''Inquirer'' and ''Daily News'' would be re-sold to Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C., a local group led by advertising executive [[Brian Tierney]] and co-founder of the [[Toll Brothers]] homebuilding firm, Bruce Toll. The deal became official on June 29, 2006. The group intended to strengthen the online presence of both papers, and began an extensive ad campaign.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Harold | last=Brubaker |author2=Joseph N. DiStefano | date=May 23, 2006  | title=Local group buys Inquirer, Daily News, Philly.com | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref>

Falling circulation and ad revenue caused Philadelphia Media Holdings to make the ''Daily News'' into an edition of ''The Philadelphia Inquirer''. Without making any other changes to the ''Daily News'', making it part of ''The Inquirer'' would combine the circulation numbers of both papers by the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulation]]. The idea was to make the newspapers more attractive to advertisers.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Dave |last=Davies |date=March 2, 2009 |title=Daily News to be labeled edition of Inquirer; no change to content, staff  |website=Philly.com }}</ref> On April 14, 2010 Brian Tierney announced that the ''Daily News'' would launch a weekend edition in October. The weekend edition's content would be similar to the daily edition, but would have features that would not be time sensitive and be able to be read anytime during the week.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Peter | last=Van Allen | date=April 13, 2010 | title=Philadelphia Daily News to launch a weekend edition in fall | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2010/04/12/daily12.html | accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref>

In early 2009, debts from buying the newspapers forced Philadelphia Newspapers LLC into [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]].<ref>{{cite journal | first=Richard | last=Pérez-Peña | date=February 22, 2009 | title=Philadelphia Newspapers Seeking Bankruptcy | journal=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/business/media/23philly.html?ref=media | accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref> The bankruptcy was the beginning of a year-long dispute between Philadelphia Media Holdings and creditors. The group of creditors, which include banks and hedge funds, wanted to take control of Philadelphia Newspapers LLC themselves and oppose efforts by Philadelphia media Holdings to keep control. Philadelphia Media Holdings received support from most of the paper's unions and launched a public relations campaign to promote local ownership.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=Denvir |date=September 3, 2009 |title=Local Flavor |journal=Columbia Journalism Review |url=https://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/local_flavor.php }}</ref>

A bankruptcy auction was held on April 28, 2010. The group of lending creditors and a group of local investors allied with Brian Tierney both bid for Philadelphia Newspapers, but the lenders had the winning bid.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Christopher K. |last=Hepp |author2=Harold Brubaker |date=April 28, 2010 |title=Phila. Newspapers sold to lenders |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20100428_Bidding_finally_begins_to_Inquirer__Daily_News_and_Philly_com.html |journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer}}</ref> The lenders' company, [[Philadelphia Media Network]], took control later that year. In July 2012, after selling the Inquirer Building in 2011, the ''Daily News'' along with ''The Inquirer'' and Philly.com moved their offices to the 3rd floor of the old [[Strawbridge's|Strawbridge & Clothier]] department store on East Market Street.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Inga |last=Saffron |date=July 14, 2012 |title=Will our move to Market Street move the street? |url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-07-14/news/32664438_1_foxwoods-circulation-managers-big-city |journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer}}</ref>

In 2019, Philadelphia Media Network renamed Philly.com Inquirer.com and made the ''Daily News'' an edition of the ''Inquirer''. Philadelphia Media Network was renamed The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Why the Inquirer is replacing Philly.com| work = Billy Penn| accessdate = 2019-08-25| url = https://billypenn.com/2019/06/01/why-the-inquirer-is-replacing-philly-com/}}</ref>
