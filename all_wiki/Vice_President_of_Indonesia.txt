[[File:Mohammad Hatta 1950.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Mohammad Hatta]], the first Vice President of Indonesia]]

The '''Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia''' ({{lang-id|Wakil Presiden Republik Indonesia}}) is second-highest officer in the [[executive branch]] of the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]], after the [[President of Indonesia|president]], and ranks first in the presidential line of succession. Since [[2004 Indonesian presidential election|2004]], the president and vice president are [[Direct election|directly elected]] to a five-year term.

[[Ma'ruf Amin]] is the [[List of vice presidents of Indonesia|13th]] and current vice president of Indonesia. He [[Second inauguration of Joko Widodo|assumed]] office on 20 October 2019.

==History of the office==
The Indonesian Vice Presidency was established during the formulation of the [[Constitution of Indonesia|1945 Constitution]] by the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence]] (BPUPK). The office was first filled on 18 August 1945 when [[Mohammad Hatta]] was elected by acclamation.<ref>[http://www.mail-archive.com/rantaunet@googlegroups.com/msg02583.html [EMAIL PROTECTED&#93; Dr. Muhammad Hatta<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The election was conducted by the [[Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence]] (PPKI) because the body responsible for the vice-presidential elections, the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR), had not been formed yet. On 16 October 1945, Hatta announced a vice-presidential decree which gave the [[Central Indonesian National Committee]] (KNIP) equal status with that of the President.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.transparansi.or.id/kajian/kajian10/bab_I.html |title=Usulan MTI tentang Amandemen UUD 1945<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=12 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601153212/http://www.transparansi.or.id/kajian/kajian10/bab_I.html |archive-date=1 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As a result of this decree, the KNIP was able to separate the role of [[Head of State]] and [[Head of Government]] on 11 November 1945. Although a new constitution had not been set up yet, Indonesia was now a [[de facto]] Parliamentary Democracy.

During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], both Hatta and Sukarno were captured by the Dutch in [[Yogyakarta]] on 18 December 1948. Together with Sukarno, Hatta gave [[Syafruddin Prawiranegara]] a mandate to form an [[Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia|emergency government]].<ref>[http://www.mail-archive.com/urangawak@yahoogroups.com/msg01229.html [Urangawak&#93; Peran PDRI Akhirnya Diakui<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011014520/http://www.mail-archive.com/urangawak@yahoogroups.com/msg01229.html |date=11 October 2007 }}</ref> This was done and the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) was formed in Sumatra with Prawiranegara as Chairman. Prawiranegara handed back his mandate to Sukarno and consequently, to Hatta on 13 July 1949.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0208/16/opini/meng27.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316075544/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0208/16/opini/meng27.htm |archive-date=16 March 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Now officially an independent nation, Indonesia adopted the Provisional Constitution, a document which defined the president's role as a ceremonial head of state whose role was to appoint a prime minister on the advice of formateurs.<ref>http://www.sjdih.depkeu.go.id/fulltext/1950/UUDSTAHUN~1950UUDS.HTM</ref> Although the vice presidency continued to exist, the form of government was now officially a parliamentary democracy and there was not a significant role for the vice president to play. On 1 December 1956, partly because of his differences with Sukarno, Hatta resigned from the Vice Presidency.<ref>[http://www.mail-archive.com/palanta@minang.rantaunet.org/msg19878.html [EMAIL PROTECTED&#93; Mengenang Mundurnya Bung Hatta<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

For the next 17 years, the vice presidency remained vacant. In December 1965, there were calls for a vice president to be named to assist President Sukarno during the times of uncertainty.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hughes |first= John |title= The End of Sukarno: A Coup That Misfired: A Purge That Ran Wild |origyear= 1967 |edition= 3rd |year= 2002 |publisher= Archipelago Press |location= Singapore |isbn=981-4068-65-9 |pages= 215}}</ref> The idea did not gain momentum and the vice presidency continued to remain vacant as the presidency passed over from Sukarno to General [[Suharto]].

In March 1973, the vice presidency vacancy was filled by [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] when he was elected by the MPR. After Hamengkubuwono IX and throughout the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]], the vice presidency was successively held by [[Adam Malik]], [[Umar Wirahadikusumah]], [[Sudharmono]], [[Try Sutrisno]], and [[BJ Habibie]]. During his time as president, Suharto would reduce the vice presidency to a sinecure. A vice president was reduced to making sure that government policy was being implemented and attending ceremonies.<ref>[http://www.library.ohiou.edu/indopubs/2001/01/20/0011.html [INDONESIA-NEWS&#93; KMP - Asal-Usul dengan Bondan Winar<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The vice president did not even take on presidential duties when Suharto was either out of the country or ill.<ref>[http://www.hamline.edu/apakabar/basisdata/1998/01/04/0001.html [INDONESIA-L&#93; TI - Wapres Hanya Ban<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917183936/http://www.hamline.edu/apakabar/basisdata/1998/01/04/0001.html |date=17 September 2006 }}</ref> The office would derogatorily be known as ''Ban Serep'' (Spare Tire). Despite being a largely figurehead role, the vice presidency twice became a source of controversy with Sudharmono having to face various obstacles en route to being Vice President in 1988 and Try being preemptively nominated in 1993.

With Suharto's fall in May 1998 and Habibie's accession to the presidency, the vice presidency once again became vacant. In October 1999, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] was elected as vice president and the office began to gain significance. Megawati was delegated genuine tasks to do<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/jan2000/ind-j10.shtml Fighting in the Malukus heightened tensions across Indonesia and within the Wahid cabinet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and in 2000, she even became responsible for the day-to-day running of the government.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

During the 2001 MPR Annual Session, it was finally decided that from 2004 onwards, the vice president, together with the president, would directly be elected by the people.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/indonesian/archive/2001-11/a-2001-11-06-1-1.cfm MPR Dan Pemilihan Presiden Langsung - 2001-11-06<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825164529/http://www.voanews.com/indonesian/archive/2001-11/a-2001-11-06-1-1.cfm |date=25 August 2006 }}</ref> The substantial role that the vice presidency was to have was evident in the way in which the 2004 presidential candidates chose their [[running mate]]s. [[Jusuf Kalla]] subsequently became Indonesia's first directly elected vice president.

If the president and the vice president die, resign, or are unable to perform their duties for any reason, the government will be taken over together by minister of foreign affairs, minister of internal affairs and minister of defence. Then the MPR will elect a new president from the two candidates nominated by the political parties whose candidates are the winner and the runner-up in the past presidential election. If the vice presidency becomes vacant with the president still holding office, the president nominates two candidates and the MPR has to elect a new vice president out of the candidates within 60 days.<ref>http://news.detik.com/read/2010/01/22/184420/1284302/10/wapres-bisa-jadi-presiden-kemudian-memilih-wakilnya?nd771108bcj</ref> Under the amended constitution, the vice president can now be impeached and removed from office. If the vice president is viewed to be unfit to perform his duties and has committed crimes such as corruption and betraying the Nation, the DPR can appeal to the Supreme Court to try the vice president. Furthermore, the DPR can ask the Constitutional Court to look into the matter, during which it has 90 days to make a decision. With the decision made, the DPR can motion for the MPR to convene. The vice president would then be given one last chance to defend himself or herself before the MPR makes the decision whether or not the vice president should be impeached.

===Post-vice presidency===
Law 7 of 1978<ref>http://kambing.vlsm.org/bebas/v01/RI/uu/1978/uu-1978-007.txt</ref> stipulates that former vice presidents are entitled to a pension.
