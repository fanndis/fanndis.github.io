Jack, the youngest brother, was born in [[London, Ontario]]. The three elder brothers began in the [[movie theater]] business, having acquired a [[movie projector]] with which they showed films in the mining towns of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]]. In the beginning,<ref>{{cite book| last=Green| first=Fitzhugh| title=The Film Finds Its Toungue| location=New York| page=41| publisher=G.P.

They opened their first theater, the [[Cascade Center|Cascade]], in [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]], in 1903.

When the original building was in danger of being demolished, the modern Warner Bros. called the current building owners, and arranged to save it. The owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance.<ref>WQED educational film "Things that are still here", PBS [[WQED (TV)|WQED]], [[Pittsburgh]], PA</ref>

In 1912, Harry Warner hired an auditor named [[Paul Ashley Chase]]. By the time of [[World War I]] they had begun producing films. In 1918 they opened the [[Old Warner Brothers Studio|first Warner Brothers Studio]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in Hollywood. Sam and Jack produced the pictures, while Harry and Albert, along with their auditor and now controller Chase, handled finance and distribution in New York City. During World War I their first nationally syndicated film, ''My Four Years in Germany,'' based on a popular book by former ambassador [[James W. Gerard]], was released. On April 4, 1923, with help from money loaned to Harry by his banker Motley Flint,<ref name="p77">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p= 77}}</ref> they formally incorporated as '''Warner Bros.

The first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to [[Avery Hopwood]]'s 1919 Broadway play, ''[[The Gold Diggers (1919 play)|The Gold Diggers]]'', from theatrical impresario [[David Belasco]]. However, [[Rin Tin Tin]],<ref name="HBTN000">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p=81}}</ref> a dog brought from France after World War I by an American soldier, established their reputation.<ref name="HBTN80">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p= 80}}</ref> Rin Tin Tin's third film was the feature ''[[Where the North Begins]]'', which was so successful that Jack signed the dog to star in more films for $1,000 per week.<ref name="HBTN000" /> Rin Tin Tin became the studio's top star.<ref name="HBTN000" /> Jack nicknamed him "The Mortgage Lifter"<ref name="HBTN000" /> and the success boosted [[Darryl F.

Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and Lubitsch, Warner's remained a lesser studio.<ref name="HBTN876">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p= 83}}</ref> Sam and Jack decided to offer Broadway actor [[John Barrymore]] the lead role in ''[[Beau Brummel (1924 film)|Beau Brummel]]''.<ref name="HBTN876" /> The film was so successful that Harry signed Barrymore to a long-term contract;<ref name="HBTN87680">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p= 84}}</ref> like ''[[The Marriage Circle]]'', ''Beau Brummel'' was named one of the ten best films of the year by the ''Times''.<ref name="HBTN87680" /> By the end of 1924, Warner Bros. was arguably [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood's]] most successful independent studio,<ref name="HBTN87680" /> where it competed with "The Big Three" Studios ([[First National Pictures|First National]], [[Paramount Pictures]], and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]).<ref name="+NHAR(*">{{cite news |title=Theatre Owners Open War on Hays |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=14 |date=May 12, 1925}}</ref> As a result, Harry Warner—while speaking at a convention of 1,500 independent exhibitors in Milwaukee, Wisconsin—was able to convince the filmmakers to spend $500,000 in newspaper advertising,<ref name="HBTN99998">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998|p=86}}</ref> and Harry saw this as an opportunity to establish theaters in cities such as New York and Los Angeles.<ref name="HBTN99998" />

As the studio prospered, it gained backing from [[Wall Street]], and in 1924 [[Goldman Sachs]] arranged a major loan. With this new money, the Warners bought the pioneer [[Vitagraph Studios|Vitagraph Company]] which had a nationwide distribution system.<ref name="HBTN99998" /> In 1925, Warners' also experimented in radio, establishing a successful radio station, [[KFWB]], in Los Angeles.<ref name="HBTN998">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998|p=88}}</ref>

=== 1925–1935: Sound, color, style ===
Warner Bros. was a pioneer of films with [[synchronization|synchronized sound]] (then known as [[Sound film|"talking pictures"]] or "talkies"). In 1925, at Sam's urging, Warner's agreed to add this feature to their productions.<ref name="HBTN95">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p=95}}</ref> By February 1926, the studio reported a net loss of $333,413.<ref name="Freedland27">{{cite book| last=Freedland| first=Michael| title=The Warner Brothers| publisher=St. Martin's Press| page=27| isbn=978-0-312-85620-5| date=December 1983| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFceAAAAMAAJ&q=1926+loss|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

After a long period denying Sam's request for sound, Harry agreed to change, as long as the studio's use of synchronized sound was for background music purposes only.<ref name="HBTN95" /> The Warners signed a contract with the sound engineer company [[Western Electric]] and established [[Vitaphone]].<ref name="HBTN96">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p= 96}}</ref> In 1926, Vitaphone began making films with music and effects tracks, most notably, in the feature ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' starring [[John Barrymore]]. The film was silent, but it featured a large number of Vitaphone shorts at the beginning. To hype ''Don Juan''{{'}}s release, Harry acquired the large Piccadilly Theater in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], and renamed it Warners' Theatre.<ref name="thomas56">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p= 56}}</ref>

''Don Juan'' premiered at the Warners' Theatre in New York on August 6, 1926.<ref name="thomas56" /> Throughout the early history of film distribution, theater owners hired orchestras to attend film showings, where they provided [[soundtrack]]s. Through Vitaphone, Warner Bros. produced eight shorts (which were played at the beginning of every showing of ''Don Juan'' across the country) in 1926. Many film production companies questioned the necessity.<ref name="thomas57">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p= 57}}</ref> ''Don Juan'' did not recoup its production cost<ref name="HBTN113">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998|p=103}}</ref> and Lubitsch left for MGM.<ref name="HBTN876" /> By April 1927, the Big Five studios (First National, Paramount, MGM, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]], and Producers Distributing) had ruined Warner's,<ref name="thomas59">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p=59}}</ref> and Western Electric renewed Warner's Vitaphone contract with terms that allowed other film companies to test sound.<ref name="thomas59" />

As a result of their financial problems, Warner Bros. took the next step and released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' starring [[Al Jolson]]. This movie, which includes little sound dialogue, but did feature sound segments of Jolson singing, was a sensation. It signaled the beginning of the era of "talking pictures" and the twilight of the [[Silent film|silent]] era. However, Sam died the night before the opening, preventing the brothers from attending the premiere. Jack became sole head of production.<ref name="Warner180-181">Warner and Jennings (1964), pp.180–181</ref> Sam's death also had a great effect on Jack's emotional state,<ref name="jewishmag.com">{{cite web| url=http://www.jewishmag.com/75mag/hollywood/hollywood.htm| title=Jews in Hollywood| publisher=Jewishmag.com| access-date=December 30, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107115340/http://www.jewishmag.com/75mag/hollywood/hollywood.htm| archive-date=January 7, 2008| url-status=dead}}</ref> as Sam was arguably Jack's inspiration and favorite brother.<ref name="thomas62">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p= 62}}</ref> In the years to come, Jack kept the studio under tight control.<ref name="jewishmag.com" /> Firing employees was common.<ref name="thomas100101">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|pp= 100–101}}</ref> Among those whom Jack fired were Rin Tin Tin (in 1929) and [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] (in 1933), the latter having served as First National's top star since the brothers acquired the studio in 1928.<ref name="thomas100101" />

Thanks to the success of ''The Jazz Singer'', the studio was cash-rich.

[[File:Warner Bros 1920.jpg|thumb|Warner Bros.–First National Studios, Burbank, c. 1928]]
In 1928, Warner Bros. released ''[[Lights of New York (1928 film)|Lights of New York]]'', the first all-talking feature. Due to its success, the movie industry converted entirely to sound almost overnight. By the end of 1929, all the major studios were exclusively making sound films. In 1929, First National Pictures released their first film with Warner Bros., ''[[Noah's Ark (1928 film)|Noah's Ark]]''.<ref name="HBTN114189">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998|p=151}}</ref> Despite its expensive budget, ''Noah's Ark'' was profitable.<ref name="HBTN114551">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998|p=150}}</ref> In 1929, Warner Bros. released ''[[On with the Show! (1929 film)|On with the Show!]]'', the first all-color all-talking feature. This was followed by ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' which would play in theaters until 1939. The success of these pictures caused a color revolution. Warner Bros. color films from 1929 to 1931 included ''[[The Show of Shows]]'' (1929), ''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929), ''[[Bright Lights (1930 film)|Bright Lights]]'' (1930), ''[[Golden Dawn (film)|Golden Dawn]]'' (1930), ''[[Hold Everything (1930 film)|Hold Everything]]'' (1930), ''[[Song of the Flame]]'' (1930), ''[[Song of the West]]'' (1930), ''[[The Life of the Party (1930 film)|The Life of the Party]]'' (1930), ''[[Sweet Kitty Bellairs]]'' (1930), ''[[Under a Texas Moon]]'' (1930), ''[[Bride of the Regiment]]'' (1930), ''[[Viennese Nights]]'' (1931), ''[[Woman Hungry (film)|Woman Hungry]]'' (1931), ''[[Kiss Me Again (1931 film)|Kiss Me Again]]'' (1931), ''[[50 Million Frenchmen (film)|50 Million Frenchmen]]'' (1931) and ''[[Manhattan Parade]]'' (1932). In addition to these, scores of features were released with [[Technicolor]] sequences, as well as numerous [[Technicolor Specials (Warner Bros. series)|Technicolor Specials short subjects]]. The majority of these color films were musicals.

In 1929, Warner Bros. bought the St. Louis-based theater chain [[Skouras Brothers Enterprises]]. Following this takeover, [[Spyros Skouras]], the driving force of the chain, became general manager of the Warner Brothers Theater Circuit in America. He worked successfully in that post for two years and turned its losses into profits.

Soon afterward Warner Bros. moved to the First National lot in Burbank. Though the companies merged, the Justice Department required Warner to release a few films each year under the First National name until 1938. For thirty years, certain Warner productions were identified (mainly for tax purposes) as 'A Warner Bros.–First National Picture.'

By 1932, musicals were declining in popularity, and the studio was forced to cut musical numbers from many productions and advertise them as straight comedies. The public had begun to associate musicals with color, and thus studios began to abandon its use.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Warner Bros. had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process. As a result, the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio: ''[[Doctor X (film)|Doctor X]]'' (1932) and ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' (1933).

[[File:Warner Brother Studios from The Petrified Forest film trailer.jpg|thumb|The studio as depicted in the [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for ''[[The Petrified Forest]]'' (1936)]]

By 1936, contracts of musical and silent stars were not renewed, instead being replaced by tough-talking, working-class types who better fit these pictures. [[Dorothy Mackaill]], [[Dolores del Río]], [[Bebe Daniels]], [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]], [[Winnie Lightner]], [[Bernice Claire]], Alexander Gray, [[Alice White]], and [[Jack Mulhall]] that had characterized the urban, modern, and sophisticated attitude of the 1920s gave way to [[James Cagney]], [[Joan Blondell]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[Warren William]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]], who would be more acceptable to the common man. The studio was one of the most prolific producers of [[Pre-Code Hollywood|Pre-Code]] pictures and had a lot of trouble with the censors once they started clamping down on what they considered indecency (around 1934).<ref name="HBTN181">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| pp=188–189}}</ref> As a result, Warner Bros. turned to historical pictures from around 1935 to avoid confrontations with the Breen office.

After [[Hal B. Wallis]] succeeded Zanuck in 1933,<ref name="thomas88">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p=88}}</ref> and the Hays Code began to be enforced in 1935, the studio was forced to abandon this realistic approach in order to produce more moralistic, idealized pictures. The studio's historical dramas, [[melodrama]]s (or "women's pictures"), swashbucklers, and adaptations of best-sellers, with stars like [[Bette Davis]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Paul Muni]], and [[Errol Flynn]], avoided the censors. In 1936, Bette Davis, by now arguably the studio's top star,<ref name="HBT%^$HYNA66">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998|pp=219–221}}</ref> was unhappy with her roles.

=== Code era ===
In the 1930s many actors and actresses who had characterized the realistic pre-Code era, but who were not suited to the new trend into moral and idealized pictures, disappeared. Warner Bros. remained a top studio in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], but this changed after 1935 as other studios, notably MGM, quickly overshadowed the prestige and glamor that previously characterized Warner Bros. However, in the late 1930s, Bette Davis became the studio's top draw and was even dubbed as "The Fifth Warner Brother." {{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

During 1936, ''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'' proved a box office success<ref name="thomas114">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p=114}}</ref> and star Paul Muni won the Oscar for Best Actor in March 1937.<ref name="thomas114" /> The studio's 1937 film ''[[The Life of Emile Zola]]'' gave the studio the first of its seven [[Best Picture Oscar]]s.<ref name="thomas114" />

In 1937, the studio hired Midwestern radio announcer [[Ronald Reagan]], who would eventually become the [[President of the United States]]. Although Reagan was initially a B-film actor, Warner Bros. was impressed by his performance in the final scene of ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]'', and agreed to pair him with Flynn in ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' (1940). Reagan then returned to B-films.<ref name="thomas117">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p=117}}</ref> After his performance in the studio's 1942 ''[[Kings Row]]'', Warner decided to make Reagan a top star and signed him to a new contract, tripling his salary.<ref name="thomas117118">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p=117&nbsp;118}}</ref>

=== Warner's cartoons ===
{{Main|Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. Animation}}
Warner's [[cartoon]] unit had its roots in the independent [[Harman and Ising]] studio. From 1930 to 1933, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] alumni Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising produced musical cartoons for [[Leon Schlesinger]], who sold them to Warner. Harman and Ising introduced their character [[Bosko]] in the first ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon, ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'', and created a sister series, ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'', in 1931.<ref name="HBTN987980">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p= 187}}</ref>

Harman and Ising broke away from Schlesinger in 1933 due to a contractual dispute, taking Bosko with them to MGM. As a result, Schlesinger started his own studio, [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], which continued with ''Merrie Melodies'' while starting production on ''Looney Tunes'' starring [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]], a Bosko clone. By the end of World War II, a new Schlesinger production team, including directors [[Friz Freleng]] (started in 1934), [[Tex Avery]] (started in 1935), [[Frank Tashlin]] (started in 1936), [[Bob Clampett]] (started in 1937), [[Chuck Jones]] (started in 1938), and [[Robert McKimson]] (started in 1946), was formed. Schlesinger's staff developed a fast-paced, irreverent style that made their cartoons globally popular.

In 1935, Avery directed [[Porky Pig]] cartoons that established the character as the studio's first animated star.<ref name="TermiteTerrace">Barrier, Michael (1999). pp.329–333</ref> In addition to Porky, [[Daffy Duck]] (who debuted in 1937's ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]''), [[Elmer Fudd]] (''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'', 1940), [[Bugs Bunny]] (''[[A Wild Hare]]'', 1940), and [[Tweety]] (''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]'', 1942) would achieve star power.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.milechai.com/product2/children_books/porky-pig-and-the-small-dog.html |title=Porky Pig and the Small Dog |website=Aharon's Jewish Books and Judaica – Mile Chai City |access-date=July 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714093724/http://www.milechai.com/product2/children_books/porky-pig-and-the-small-dog.html |archive-date=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> By 1942, the Schlesinger studio had surpassed Walt Disney Studios as the most successful producer of animated shorts.<ref>"[http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. bought Schlesinger's cartoon unit in 1944 and renamed it [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]. However, senior management treated the unit with indifference, beginning with the installation as senior producer of [[Edward Selzer]], whom the creative staff considered an interfering incompetent. Jack Warner had little regard for the company's short film product and reputedly was so ignorant about the animation division of the studio that he was mistakenly convinced that the unit produced cartoons of [[Mickey Mouse]], the flagship character of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]].<ref name="thomas212" /> He sold off the unit's pre-August 1948 library for $3,000 each, which proved a shortsighted transaction in light of its eventual value.<ref name="thomas212">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|pp= 211–12}}</ref>

Warner Bros. Cartoons continued, with intermittent interruptions, until 1969 when it was dissolved as the parent company ceased film shorts entirely. Characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, [[Tweety]], [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]], and [[Porky Pig]] became central to the company's image in subsequent decades. Bugs in particular remains a mascot to Warner Bros., its various divisions and [[Six Flags]] (which Time Warner once owned). The success of the compilation film ''[[The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie]]'' in 1979, featuring the archived film of these characters, prompted Warner Bros. to organize [[Warner Bros. Animation]] as a new production division to restart production of original material.

=== World War II ===
According to Warner's autobiography, prior to US entry in [[World War II]], Philip Kauffman, Warner Bros. German sales head, was murdered by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in Berlin in 1936.<ref>{{cite book| page=37| last1=McLaughlin| first1=Robert L.| last2=Parry| first2=Sally E.| title=We'll Always Have the Movies: American Cinema in World War II| date=March 3, 2006| publisher=University Press of Kentucky| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_FhXmwiyHqAC&q=confessions+of+nazi+spy| isbn=0-8131-7137-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| page=17| last=Birdwell| first=Michael E.| title=Celluloid Soldiers: The Warner Bros.

[[File:Bette Davis in Now Voyager trailer.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Bette Davis]] in ''Now, Voyager'' (1942)]]
During the war era, the studio made ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[Now, Voyager]]'', ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (all 1942), ''[[This Is the Army]]'', and ''[[Mission to Moscow]]'' (both 1943);<ref name="pages247">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998|pp=247–255}}</ref> the last of these films became controversial a few years afterwards. At the premieres of ''Yankee Doodle Dandy'' (in Los Angeles, New York, and London), audiences purchased $15.6&nbsp;million in [[war bond]]s for the governments of England and the United States. By the middle of 1943, however, audiences had tired of war films, but Warner continued to produce them, losing money. In honor of the studio's contributions to the cause, the Navy named a [[Liberty ship]] after the brothers' father, Benjamin Warner. Harry christened the ship. By the time the war ended, $20&nbsp;million in war bonds were purchased through the studio, the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] collected 5,200 pints of [[blood plasma]] from studio employees<ref name="pages247" /> and 763 of the studio's employees served in the armed forces, including Harry Warner's son-in-law [[Milton Sperling]] and Jack's son Jack Warner, Jr.<ref name="GRTWBiokj1y" /> Following a dispute over ownership of ''Casablanca''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Oscar for Best Picture, Wallis resigned. After ''Casablanca'' made Bogart a top star, Bogart's relationship with Jack deteriorated.<ref name="Thomas144z" />

In 1943, [[Olivia de Havilland]] (whom Warner frequently loaned to other studios) sued Warner for breach of contract.<ref name="Thomas145">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p=145}}</ref> De Havilland had refused to portray famed abolitionist [[Elizabeth Blackwell]] in an upcoming film for Columbia Pictures.<ref name="Thomas145" /> Warner responded by sending 150 telegrams to different film production companies, warning them not to hire her for any role.<ref name="Thomas145" /> Afterwards, de Havilland discovered [[De Havilland Law|employment contracts in California could only last seven years]]; de Havilland had been under contract with the studio since 1935.<ref name="Thomas98">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p=98}}</ref> The court ruled in de Havilland's favor and she left the studio in favor of RKO Radio Pictures, and, eventually, Paramount.<ref name="Thomas145" /> Through de Havilland's victory, many of the studio's longtime actors were now freed from their contracts, and Harry decided to terminate the studio's suspension policy.<ref name="Thomas145" /><ref name="Thomas148">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p=148}}</ref>

=== After World War II: changing hands ===
In the post-war years, Warner Bros. prospered greatly and continued to create new stars, including [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Doris Day]].<ref name="LUI_(">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| pp=258–279}}</ref> By 1946, company payroll reached $600,000 a week<ref name="LUI_(" /> and net profit topped $19.4&nbsp;million.
Jack Warner continued to refuse to meet [[Screen Actors Guild]] salary demands.<ref name="thomas163">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p=163}}</ref> In September 1946, employees engaged in a month-long strike.<ref name="thomas163" /> In retaliation, Warner—during his 1947 testimony before [[United States Congress|Congress]] about ''Mission to Moscow''—accused multiple employees of ties to Communists.<ref name="thomas164">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p=164}}</ref> By the end of 1947, the studio reached a record net profit of $22&nbsp;million.<ref name="GRTWBiodry2prt)">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p=279}}</ref>

On January 5, 1948, Warner offered the first color [[newsreel]], covering the [[Rose Parade|Tournament of Roses Parade]] and the [[Rose Bowl Game]]. In 1948, Bette Davis, still their top actress and now hostile to Jack, was a big problem for Harry after she and others left the studio after completing the film ''[[Beyond the Forest]]''.<ref name="thomas175176">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|pp=175, 176}}</ref>

Warner was a party to the ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' antitrust case of the 1940s. This action, brought by the Justice Department and the [[Federal Trade Commission]], claimed the five integrated studio-theater chain combinations restrained competition. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] heard the case in 1948, and ruled for the government. As a result, Warner and four other major studios were forced to separate production from the exhibition. In 1949, the studio's net profit was only $10&nbsp;million.<ref name="GRTWBiodry2prt)" />

Warner Bros. had two semi-independent production companies that released films through the studio.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} One of these was [[Milton Sperling|Sperling]]'s [[United States Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/112308/Milton-Sperling/biography| title=Milton Sperling biography| work=[[The New York Times]]| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306230517/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/112308/Milton-Sperling/biography| archive-date=March 6, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Vivien Leigh in Streetcar Named Desire trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Vivien Leigh]] as [[Blanche DuBois]] in [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (1951)]]]]
In the early 1950s, the threat of television emerged. In 1953, Jack decided to copy<ref name="268lk" /> [[United Artists]] successful 3D film ''[[Bwana Devil]]'', releasing his own 3D films beginning with ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]''.<ref name="p287">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998|p=287}}</ref> However, 3D films soon lost their appeal among moviegoers.<ref name="thomas191">{{harvnb|Thomas|1990|p= 191}}</ref>

3D almost caused the demise of the Warner Bros. cartoon studio. Having completed a 3D Bugs Bunny cartoon, ''[[Lumber Jack-Rabbit]]'', Jack Warner ordered the animation unit to be closed, erroneously believing that all cartoons hence would be produced in the 3D process. Several months later, Warner relented and reopened the cartoon studio. Warner Bros. had enough of a backlog of cartoons and a healthy reissue program so that there was no noticeable interruption in the release schedule.

In 1952, Warner Bros. made their first film (''[[Carson City (film)|Carson City]]'') in "Warnercolor", the studio's name for [[Eastmancolor]].

After the downfall of 3D films, Harry Warner decided to use [[CinemaScope]] in future Warner Bros. films.<ref name="W2878">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| pp=287–288}}</ref> One of the studio's first CinemaScope films, ''[[The High and the Mighty (film)|The High and the Mighty]]'' (owned by [[John Wayne]]'s company, [[Batjac Productions]]), enabled the studio to show a profit.<ref name="W288">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p=288}}</ref>

Early in 1953, Warner's theater holdings were spun off as Stanley Warner Theaters; Stanley Warner's non-theater holdings were sold to Simon Fabian Enterprises,<ref name="Purch56">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808529,00.html |title=Boston to Hollywood |access-date=July 9, 2008 |date=May 21, 1956 |work=Time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214112021/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808529,00.html |archive-date=December 14, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> and its theaters merged with [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] Theatres to become RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres.<ref>{{cite book|title=The American Film Industry|last=Balio|first=Tino|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=eT_6IcZM-fAC |page=567}} |year=1985 |page=567 |isbn=978-0-299-09874-2 |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press}}</ref>

Jack had problems with [[Milton Berle]]'s unsuccessful film ''[[Always Leave Them Laughing]]'' during the peak of Berle's television popularity. Warner felt that Berle was not strong enough to carry a film and that people would not pay to see the man they could see on television for free. However, Jack was pressured into using Berle, who replaced [[Danny Kaye]].<ref>[https://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_061149-1/10 Issuu.com]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> Berle's outrageous behavior on the set and the film's massive failure led to Jack banning television sets from film sets.<ref>p.144 Hope, Bob & Shavelson, Mel ''Don't Shoot, It's Only Me'' 1991 Jove Books</ref>

On March 21, 1955, the studio was finally able to engage in television through the successful [[Warner Bros. Television]] unit run by [[William T. Orr]], Jack Warner's son-in-law. Warner Bros. Television provided [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] with a weekly show, ''[[Warner Bros. Presents]].'' The show featured rotating shows based on three film successes, ''[[Kings Row#Television series|Kings Row]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)#Sequels and other versions|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[Cheyenne (1947 film)|Cheyenne]]'', followed by a promotion for a new film.<ref name="bbddpp">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1955/1955-03-21-BC.pdf | title=Warner Bros.

In 1958, the studio launched [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Initially, the label released recordings made by their television stars—whether they could sing or not—and records based on television soundtracks. Warner Bros. was already the owner of extensive music-publishing holdings, whose tunes had appeared in countless cartoons (arranged by [[Carl Stalling]]) and television shows (arranged by [[Max Steiner]]).<ref>{{IMDb name|70|Max Steiner}}</ref> In 2004, Time Warner sold the [[Warner Music Group]], along with Warner Bros.

While he slowly recovered from a car crash that occurred while vacationing in France in 1958, Jack returned to the studio and made sure his name was featured in studio press releases. From 1961 to 1963, the studio's annual net profit was a little over $7&nbsp;million.<ref name="H:325">{{harvnb|Warner|Sperling|Millner|1998| p=325}}</ref> Warner paid an unprecedented $5.5&nbsp;million for the film rights to the Broadway musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' in February 1962.

Few studio films were made in favor of co-productions (for which Warner provided facilities, money and distribution), and pickups of independent pictures.

With the success of the studio's 1964 film of Broadway play ''[[My Fair Lady]]'',<ref name="thomas2645" /> as well as its soundtrack,<ref name="thomas2645" /> Warner Bros. Records became a profitable subsidiary. The 1966 film ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

He retired in 1973 and died from serious health complications of heart inflammation in August 1978.

Although movie audiences had shrunk, Warner's new management believed in the drawing power of stars, signing co-production deals with several of the biggest names of the day, including [[Paul Newman]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Barbra Streisand]], and [[Clint Eastwood]], carrying the studio successfully through the 1970s and 1980s. Its hits in the early 1970s included those starring the aforementioned actors, along with comedian [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', [[John Boorman]]'s ''[[Deliverance]]'', and the [[Martin Scorsese]] productions ''[[Mean Streets]]'' and ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]''. Warner Bros. also made major profits on films and television shows built around the characters of [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] owned by Warner Bros. subsidiary [[DC Comics]]. The 1970s also saw Warner Bros. Records become one of the major record labels worldwide, and that company gained sister labels in [[Elektra Records]] and [[Atlantic Records]].

In late 1973, Warner Bros. announced that it had partnered with 20th Century Fox to co-produce a single film: producer [[Irwin Allen]]'s ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardswatch.com/predictions/best-supporting-studio-warner-bros-pictures-track-record-in-the-best-supporting-actor-category/|location=United States|title=Best Supporting Studio: Warner Bros.

Scortia]] and [[Frank M. Robinson]]'s ''[[The Glass Inferno]]'' and Fox was preparing an adaptation of [[Richard Martin Stern]]'s ''[[The Tower (novel)|The Tower]]''. Allen insisted on a meeting with the heads of both studios, and announced that as Fox was already in the lead with their property it would be preferable to lump the two together as a single film, with Fox owning domestic rights and Warner Bros. handling the film's foreign distribution. The resulting partnership resulted in the second-highest-grossing film of 1974, turning profits for both studios, and influencing future co-productions between major studios. Although Allen would make further films for Warner Bros., he would not repeat the success he had with ''The Towering Inferno''.

Abandoning parking lots and funeral homes, the refocused Kinney renamed itself in honor of its best-known holding, [[Warner Communications]]. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Warner Communications branched out into other business, such as [[video game]] company [[Atari, Inc.]] in 1976, and later the [[Six Flags]] theme parks.

In 1972, in a cost-cutting move, Warner and Columbia formed a third company called The Burbank Studios (TBS).<ref name="Bingen">{{cite book| last1=Bingen| first1=Steven| author2=Marc Wanamaker| title=Warner Bros.: Hollywood's Ultimate Backlot| date=2014| publisher=Rowman & Littlefield| location=London| isbn=978-1-58979-962-2| pages=194–202| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjGPBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA194| access-date=April 25, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101213403/https://books.google.com/books?id=vjGPBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA194| archive-date=January 1, 2016| url-status=live}}</ref> They would share the Warner lot in Burbank.<ref name="Bingen" /> Both studios technically became production entities, giving TBS day-to-day responsibility for studio grounds and upkeep.<ref name="Bingen" /> The [[Columbia Ranch]] (about a mile north of Warner's lot) was part of the deal.<ref name="Bingen" /> The Warner–Columbia relationship was acrimonious, but the reluctance of both studios to approve or spend money on capital upgrades that might only help the other did have the unintended consequence of preserving the Warner lot's primary function as a filmmaking facility while it produced relatively little during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="Bingen" /> (Most films produced after 1968 were filmed on location after the failure of ''Camelot'' was partially attributed to the fact it was set in England but obviously filmed in Burbank.)<ref name="Bingen" /> With control over its own lot tied up in TBS, Warner ultimately retained a significant portion of its [[backlot]],<ref name="Bingen" /> while [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] sold its backlot to create [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] turned part of its backlot into [[Universal Studios Hollywood|a theme park]] and [[Universal CityWalk|shopping center]], and [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Disney replaced its backlot with office buildings]] and exiled its [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|animation department]] to an industrial park in Glendale.

In 1989, a solution to the situation became evident when Warner Bros. acquired [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] and gained control of the former MGM studio lot in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], and that same year, Sony bought Columbia Pictures.<ref name="Bingen" /> Sony was flush with cash and Warner Bros. now had two studio lots.<ref name="Bingen" /> In 1990, TBS ended when Sony bought the MGM lot from Warner and moved Columbia to Culver City.<ref name="Bingen" /> However, Warner kept the Columbia Ranch, now known as the Warner Bros. Ranch.<ref name="Bingen" />

[[Robert A. Daly]] joined Warner Brothers on December 1, 1980 taking over from Ted Ashley. His titles were Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer. One year later, he was named Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and appointed [[Terry Semel]] President and Chief Operating Officer.

===Time Warner subsidiary===
[[File:WarnerStudio.jpg|thumb|right|A panoramic view over today's studio premises]]
Warner Communications merged in 1989 with [[White-shoe firm|white-shoe]] publishing company [[Time Inc.]] Time claimed a higher level of prestige, while Warner Bros. provided the profits. The [[Time Warner]] merger was almost derailed when [[Paramount Communications]] (formerly [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]], later sold to [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]), launched a $12.2&nbsp;billion [[hostile takeover]] bid for Time Inc., forcing Time to acquire Warner with a $14.9&nbsp;billion cash/stock offer. Paramount responded with a lawsuit filed in [[Delaware]] court to break up the merger. Paramount lost and the merger proceeded.

In 1992, [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] was established to produce various family-oriented films.

In 1995, Warner and television station owner [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]] of Chicago launched [[The WB]] Television Network, seeking a niche market in teenagers. The WB's early programming included an abundance of teenage fare, such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''. Two dramas produced by [[Spelling Television]], ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'', helped bring The WB into the spotlight. ''Charmed'' lasted eight seasons, becoming the longest-running drama with female leads. ''7th Heaven'' ran for eleven seasons and was the longest-running family drama and longest-running show for the network. In 2006, Warner and [[CBS Corporation]] decided to close The WB and CBS's [[UPN]] and jointly launch [[The CW]] Television Network.

In 1998, Time Warner sold Six Flags to Premier Parks.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Shapiro| first1=Eben| title=Premier Parks to Buy Six FlagsFrom Time Warner and Partner| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB887059132285917500| access-date=3 March 2017| work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| date=10 February 1998| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303123913/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB887059132285917500| archive-date=March 3, 2017| url-status=live}}</ref> The takeover of Time Warner in 2000 by then-high-flying [[AOL]] did not prove a good match, and following the collapse in "dot-com" stocks, the AOL element was banished from the corporate name.

In 1998, Warner Bros. celebrated its 75th anniversary. In 1999, Terry Semel and Robert Daly resigned as studio heads after a career with 13 Oscar-nominated films. Daly and Semel were said to have popularized the modern model of partner financing and profit sharing for film production. In mid-1999, [[Alan F. Horn]] and [[Barry Meyer]] replaced Daly and Semel as new studio heads, in which the studio had continued success in movies, television shows, cartoons, that the previous studio heads had for the studio.

In the late 1990s, Warner obtained rights to the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and released feature film adaptations of the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|first]] in 2001. Subsequently, they released the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|second film]] in 2002, the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|third]] in June 2004, the [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|fourth]] in November 2005, the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|fifth]] in July 2007, and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|sixth]] in July 2009.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2008/08/14/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-moves-to-summer-2009 |title=Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince Moves to Summer 2009 |date=August 14, 2008 |publisher=Time Warner |access-date=September 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930083829/http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2008/08/14/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-moves-to-summer-2009 |archive-date=September 30, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The seventh (and at that time, final) book was released as two movies; [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1|Deathly Hallows&nbsp;— Part 1]] in November 2010 and [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2|Deathly Hallows&nbsp;— Part 2]] in July 2011.

From 2006, Warner Bros. operated a joint venture with [[China Film Group Corporation]] and HG to form '''Warner China Film HG''' to produce films in Hong Kong and China, including ''[[Connected (2008 film)|Connected]]'', a remake of the 2004 [[thriller film]] ''[[Cellular (film)|Cellular]]''.

Warner Bros. played a large part in the discontinuation of the [[HD DVD]] format. On January 4, 2008, Warner Bros. announced that they would drop support of HD DVD in favor of [[Blu-ray]] Disc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consolewatcher.com/warner-bros-goes-blu-ray-exclusive/ |title=Warner Bros Goes Blu Ray Exclusive |publisher=Consolewatcher.com |access-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007012656/http://www.consolewatcher.com/warner-bros-goes-blu-ray-exclusive/ |archive-date=October 7, 2008 }}</ref> HD DVDs continued to be released through May 2008, but only following Blu-ray and DVD releases.

Warner Bros.' [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] was the worldwide highest-grossing film series of all time without adjusting for inflation. Its [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film series]] was one of only two series to have two entries earn more than $1 billion worldwide. ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'' was Warner Bros.' highest-grossing movie ever (surpassing ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/07/box-office-harry-potter-deathly-hallow-part-2-winnie-the-pooh.html |title=Box Office: Final 'Harry Potter' film has highest-grossing domestic opening of all time [Updated] |date=2011-07-17 |work=Los Angeles Times |language=en |access-date=2017-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817060619/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/07/box-office-harry-potter-deathly-hallow-part-2-winnie-the-pooh.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, the Harry Potter movies have produced a net loss due to [[Hollywood accounting]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/07/studio-shame-even-harry-potter-pic-loses-money-because-of-warner-bros-phony-baloney-accounting/| website=Deadline Hollywood| title=Studio Shame!

==International distribution arrangements==
{{anchor|Columbia partnership}}From 1971 until the end of 1987, Warner's international distribution operations were a joint venture with [[Columbia Pictures]]. In some countries, this joint venture distributed films from other companies (such as [[EMI Films]] and [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]] in the UK). Warner ended the venture in 1988.

On May 4, 1987, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] signed a theatrical distribution agreement with Warner Bros. International for the release of Disney and Touchstone films in overseas markets, with Disney retaining full control of all distribution and marketing decisions on their product.<ref>{{cite news|title=Warner Bros. and Disney have a distribution pact.|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-04/business/fi-4825_1_warner-bros|access-date=January 17, 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 4, 1987|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129120124/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-04/business/fi-4825_1_warner-bros|archive-date=January 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1992, Disney opted to end their joint venture with Warner Bros. to start [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures#International arrangements|autonomously distributing their films in the aforementioned markets]].

On February 6, 2014, Columbia TriStar Warner Filmes de Portugal Ltda., a joint venture with [[Sony Pictures]] which distributed both companies' films in Portugal, announced that it would close its doors on March 31, 2014.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.dn.pt/artes/cinema/interior/columbia-tristar-warner-encerra-escritorios-em-portugal-3673331.html| title=Columbia Tristar Warner encerra escritórios em Portugal| first=Eurico| last=de Barros| work=[[Diário de Notícias]]| date=February 6, 2014| access-date=September 29, 2017| trans-title=Columbia Tristar Warner closes offices in Portugal| language=pt| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930083919/https://www.dn.pt/artes/cinema/interior/columbia-tristar-warner-encerra-escritorios-em-portugal-3673331.html| archive-date=September 30, 2017| url-status=dead}}</ref> NOS Audiovisuais handles distribution of Warner Bros. films in Portugal since then, while the distribution duties for Sony Pictures films in the country were taken over by Big Picture Films.

Warner Bros. still handles the distribution of Sony Pictures films in [[Italy]].

=== Acquired libraries ===
{{overly detailed|section|date=October 2017}}
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2019, Warner Bros. owned more than 100,000 hours of programming, including 8,600 feature films and 5,000 television programs comprising tens of thousands of individual episodes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.warnerbros.com/studio/about/company-overview |title=WarnerBros.com – Company Overview |website=Warner Bros. |access-date=September 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929152113/https://www.warnerbros.com/studio/about/company-overview |archive-date=September 29, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the aftermath of the 1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950<ref name="ymrt" /><ref name="aap exceptions" /><ref name="archive.org" /> films and cartoons to [[Associated Artists Productions]] (a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Famous Studios]] ''[[Popeye]]'' cartoons, originally from [[Paramount Pictures]]. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold to [[United Artists]], which owned the company until 1981, when [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] acquired United Artists.<ref name="Hoyt">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERsvBQAAQBAJ&q=1958+a.a.p.+was+sold+to+United+Artists&pg=PA182|title=Hollywood Vault: Film Libraries Before Home Video|last=Hoyt|first=Eric|date=2014-07-03|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95857-9|language=en}}</ref><ref name="Cole">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/16/world/m-g-m-is-reported-purchasing-united-artists-for-350-million.html|title=M-G-M Is Reported Purchasing United Artists for $350 million|last=Cole|first=Robert J.|date=May 16, 1981|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908011627/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/16/world/m-g-m-is-reported-purchasing-united-artists-for-350-million.html|archive-date=September 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Finding itself in debt, [[Turner Entertainment]] kept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the United Artists library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to the [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] library) while spinning off the rest of MGM.<ref name="articles.latimes.com">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-07/news/mn-9950_1_turner-broadcasting|title=Turner Sells Fabled MGM but Keeps a Lion's Share|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1985-12-20|access-date=2018-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801044732/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-07/news/mn-9950_1_turner-broadcasting|archive-date=August 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

== The Warner Bros. Archives ==
The [[University of Southern California]] Warner Bros. Archives is the largest single studio collection in the world. Donated in 1977 to USC's School of Cinema-Television by Warner Communications, the WBA houses departmental records that detail Warner Bros. activities from the studio's first major feature, ''My Four Years in Germany'' (1918), to its sale to Seven Arts in 1968. It presents a complete view of the production process during the [[Studio system|Golden Age of Hollywood]]. UA donated pre-1950 Warner Bros. nitrate negatives to the [[Library of Congress]] and post-1951 negatives to the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]]. Most of the company's legal files, scripts, and production materials were donated to the [[Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research]].
