The '''Ateneo de Manila University''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Pamantasang Ateneo de Manila;'' [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:'' Universidad Ateneo de Manila''), also known simply as the '''Ateneo de Manila''' or the '''Ateneo''' and abbreviated as '''AdMU''', is a private [[Catholic]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] research university in [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]. It was founded in 1859 by the [[Society of Jesus]], and has grown from a small publicly-funded school for the children of the Spanish colonial elite, into a [[Higher education in the Philippines#Autonomy and deregulation|nationally]]- and internationally-recognized teaching and research university. It is also one of several [[Ateneo#Schools named Ateneo run by the Society of Jesus in the Philippines|Jesuit-run educational institutions in the country bearing the Ateneo name]].

The university provides instruction in both basic and higher education across eleven schools, clustered into three units. Higher education is provided by two units: the [[Loyola Schools]], a group of four schools which provide undergraduate and graduate instruction in the [[arts]], [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]], [[engineering]], and [[business management]]; and the Professional Schools unit, composed of four schools providing professional education in [[law]], [[medicine]], [[Master of Business Administration|business]], and [[public policy|governance]]. Meanwhile, the Basic Education Unit, comprising the Grade School, Junior High School, and Senior High School, provides [[Education in the Philippines#K-12|education in the K to 12 level]]. The different Ateneo units' curricula are generally based on the Jesuit education tradition. This is especially pronounced in the Loyola Schools, which follows a Catholic-rooted, [[liberal arts]] core curriculum.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Core Curriculum |url=https://www.ateneo.edu/ls/undergraduate/academics/core-curriculum |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University |accessdate=May 2, 2020}}</ref> The university is also home to a number of research institutes and centers.

As of 2020, five [[Presidents of the Philippines]], five [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justices of the Philippine Supreme Court]], six [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artists]], one [[National Scientist of the Philippines|National Scientist]], and two [[Ramon Magsaysay Award|Ramon Magsaysay]] awardees have been affiliated with the Ateneo, either as students, alumni, or faculty. The most notable among the Ateneo de Manila's alumni is [[José Rizal]], considered the [[national hero of the Philippines]].

The United Kingdom-based [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] (QS) currently ranks AdMU in the 601-650 bracket of its [[QS World University Rankings|''World University Rankings'']] and 135th on its ''Asian University Rankings''.<ref name="qs rank">{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/ateneo-de-manila-university|title=Ateneo de Manila University|website=[[Quacquarelli Symonds]]|accessdate = November 27, 2020}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of the Ateneo de Manila}}
While Jesuit teaching efforts in Manila date back to 1595, the Ateneo de Manila University traces its founding to 1859 when the Jesuits, at the behest of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Fernándo Norzagaray y Escudero]], took charge of the ''Escuela Municipal de Manila'' (Municipal School of Manila), a small school for the children of Spanish residents. In 1865, its name was changed to ''Ateneo Municipal de Manila'' when it became accredited as a secondary school. It began offering the [[bachelor's degree]], as well as courses leading to certificates in agriculture, surveying, and business. When [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|Americans occupied the Philippines in 1902]], its subsidy from the city was withdrawn. The Jesuits removed the word "Municipal" from the school's name and it became simply the Ateneo de Manila. In 1908, the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|American colonial government]] licensed the Ateneo's bachelor degree and certificates in various disciplines. The Ateneo campus housed other Jesuit institutions of research and learning, such as the [[Manila Observatory]] and the San Jose Major Seminary.<ref name="History">{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.ateneo.edu/history |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University |accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>

American Jesuits replaced their Spanish brethren in 1912. In 1932, the original campus at [[Intramuros]] in [[Manila]] was destroyed by fire and the Ateneo moved to the San Jose Major Seminary grounds in [[Padre Faura]], [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]]. The Ateneo campus was destroyed again in [[World War II]]. Ateneo reopened temporarily in Plaza Guipit in [[Sampaloc, Manila]]. The Padre Faura campus reopened in 1946 with [[Quonset hut]]s serving as buildings among the campus ruins.<ref name="reyes">Soledad S. Reyes.

The Ateneo de Manila Grade School is the [[Education in the Philippines#Elementary Education|elementary education]] unit of the Ateneo de Manila, and is the oldest unit in existence - Ateneo began as a government-run primary school during the Spanish colonial period. It is an [[Single-sex education|all-boys school]] with a population of around 4,000 students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ateneo.edu/grade-school|title=Grade School|date=May 15, 2012|work=Ateneo de Manila University|access-date=October 1, 2017}}</ref> The school had implemented the [[Education in the Philippines#K-12|K-12 program]] since the 2013–14 academic year.<ref name="K-12">{{cite web |title=Ateneo de Manila starts K-12 compliance by creating the Ateneo Junior High School (AJHS) |url=https://ateneo.edu/high-school/news/ateneo-de-manila-starts-k-12-compliance-creating-ateneo-junior-high-school-ajhs |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University |accessdate=April 27, 2020 |date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> The Ateneo de Manila Grade School is one of the first elementary schools in the Philippines to adopt the [[Singapore math]] curriculum.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee-Chua |first1=Queena |title=Can parents help kids with math? |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/4328/can-parents-help-kids-with-math |accessdate=April 27, 2020 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>

====Junior High School====
The Ateneo de Manila Junior High School (AJHS) is the [[middle school]] unit of the Ateneo de Manila University, offering the [[Seventh grade|seventh]] to [[tenth grade]]s for male students. It was established in 2013 to comply with the Philippines' K-12 education system. It currently occupies the old Ateneo High School campus.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Ateneo de Manila Junior High School Planner 2017–2018|last=AJHS Planner Committee|publisher=Art Angel Printshop|year=2017|isbn=|location=Quezon City|pages=Introductory Pages}}</ref>

The AJHS has utilized a [[house system]] since 2016, labeled as "support systems for formation" aimed at "intensifying the care and formation the school bestows upon its students." The AJHS is divided according to the following four clusters, named after pivotal places in the life of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius of Loyola]]: Cardoner, La Storta, [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]], and [[Pamplona]]. Sections from Grade levels 7-10 are divided equally and placed in their respective clusters. Each cluster has dedicated class moderators, subject teachers, guidance counselors, immersion coordinators, and staff to cater to the specific needs of the students. The cluster is led by a "cluster coordinator" (teacher) and cluster head(student), who organize a variety of activities, such as [[mentorship]]s and [[team building]]. The cluster system idea came from a study of Dra. Carmela Oracion done with regards to school systems in Singapore, where results showed cluster systems benefited students more than the traditional batch systems. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ateneo.edu/ajhs/news/features/ajhs-launches-4-systems-intensify-student-care-formation|title=AJHS launches 4 systems to intensify student care & formation {{!}} Ateneo de Manila University|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University|language=en|access-date=April 1, 2018}}</ref>

According to an article written by the Hi-Lites organization of the AJHS, the goals of the cluster system include the following:

1. Platform for student-centered approach for students’ total development and close monitoring of every student to meet their academic and affective needs.

2. Immediate response as a result of the simple and flattened organization, empowering the cluster, thus moving the point of decision-making closer to the students, allowing it to be better informed and be more responsive.

3. Some degree of autonomy, bringing about more bottom-up initiatives from the teachers and students, with the possibility of customized activities.

4. Increased collegiality among teachers and other personnel, with focused attention on the students

Despite offering [[secondary education]], the AJHS offers an [[Honors colleges and programs|honors program]] for its [[English literature|English]], [[Philippine literature|Filipino]], [[Mathematics education|mathematics]], and [[Science education|science]] classes. Students who choose to pursue the honors program are placed in a separate class with a more advanced program.<ref name=":0" />

The AJHS [[Students' union|student body]] is governed by the ''Sanggunian ng mga Mag-aaral ng Nakababatang Mataas na Paaralang Ateneo de Manila'' (Sanggu-JHS; {{translation|Student Council of the Ateneo de Manila Junior High School}}). The Sanggu-JHS is led by a chairman, who is aided by a secretary-general and a finance officer, alongside four vice-chairs who supervises each branch of the Sanggu-JHS. These branches are: the Assembly of Class Officers (ACO), which involves the governance of all class officers in each section and batch; the Council of Student Organizations (CSO), which involves the governance of all officers in each [[Student society|student organization]] referred to as "villages"; and the Athletics Council (AthC), which involves the governance of all [[varsity team]] officers.<ref name=":0" />

The AJHS campus includes one library, the Faculty Instructional Technology Center, and a large athletics complex with one of the largest school-based covered courts facilities in the country.<ref name="ahsabout">{{cite web|url=http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=30|title=About the High School|publisher=Ateneo.edu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622032158/http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=30|archivedate=June 22, 2009 |url-status=live|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}</ref> A theater group called ''Dulaang Sibol'', founded by longtime faculty member [[Onofre R.

The ASHS is also governed by its own Sanggunian ng mga Mag-aaral ng Nakababatang Mataas na Paaralang Ateneo de Manila (Sanggu-ASHS; transl. Student Council of the Ateneo de Manila Junior High School). Compared to the Sanggu-JHS, Sanggu-ASHS’s Council of Student Committees (CSC) consist of 5 Sandigan committees: Kanlaon, Matanglawin, Lakambini, Mapulon, and Alunsina, where each committee has their own advocacy, alongside the ASHS Fair Committee and BlueBook Committee.

[[File:Ateneodormitoryjf1830 04.JPG|thumb|Lobby of the University Dormitory at the Ateneo]]
While the majority of its students live in Metro Manila, the university has four on-campus dormitories for college students: Cervini Hall, Eliazo Hall, University Dormitory, and the International Residence Hall.<ref>http://residencehalls.ateneo.edu/life-and-community/housing/residence-halls/ateneo-residence-halls</ref> Located near the Loyola Schools, the Cervini Hall and Eliazo Hall are the on-campus dormitories primarily aimed for freshmen and varsity students of the Ateneo de Manila University. Cervini Hall accommodates approximately two hundred male students, and neighboring Eliazo Hall houses one hundred and sixty female students. The University Dormitory, completed in 2008, houses six hundred students. Other dormitories which are also open to college and graduate school students are those of the Institute of Social Order, Arrupe International Residence, and the East Asian Pastoral Institute.<ref name="2007b"/> Those who desire to live off-campus reside in nearby accredited dormitories and condominiums along or near [[Katipunan Avenue]], such as Oracle Residences, FBR Building, Xanland Plaza, One Burgundy Plaza, Prince David Condominium, and Berkeley Residences, sharing study and living areas with students from the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] and [[Miriam College]].

Most dorm activities and support services are organized and managed by the residents themselves through the Ateneo Resident Students Association (ARSA) and its working committees. These include the orientation for new and freshmen dormers; academic tutorials, group study and book lending; [[Mass (liturgy)|Sunday masses]], evening prayer, and recollections; [[Sports day|sportsfests]], a variety show, and [[Open house (school)|open houses]].
