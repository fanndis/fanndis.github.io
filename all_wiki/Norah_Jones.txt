==Early life==
Jones was born Geethali Norah Jones Shankar on March 30, 1979, in [[Manhattan]], New York, to American concert producer Sue Jones and Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]].<ref name="ABC"/><ref name="firstpost1"/>

After her parents separated in 1986, Jones lived with her mother, growing up in [[Grapevine, Texas]]. As a child, Jones began singing in church and also took piano and voice lessons. She attended Colleyville Middle School and [[Grapevine High School]] before transferring to [[Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]] in [[Dallas]]. Her music took its first form early on in the local Methodist Church where she regularly sang solos. While in high school, she sang in the school choir, participated in band, and played the alto saxophone. At the age of 16, with both parents' consent, she officially changed her name to Norah Jones.<ref name="ABC" /><ref name="https://www.npr.org/2013/10/20/237107030/anoushka-shankar-and-norah-jones-half-sisters-collaborate-at-last">{{cite web |title=Hard to say no to free love: Ravi Shankar |work=Press Trust of India |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=April 29, 2003 |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/may/13ravi.htm |accessdate=June 20, 2014}}</ref>

Jones always had an affinity for the music of [[Bill Evans]] and [[Billie Holiday]], among other "oldies". She once said, "My mom had this eight-album Billie Holiday set; I picked out one disc that I liked and played that over and over again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yamaha.com/yasi/artists/details.html?CNTID=4102014&type=contemporary|work=Yamaha Artists Services, New York|title=Norah Jones|access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref>

She attended [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] during the summers. While at high school, she won the ''[[Down Beat]]'' Student Music Awards for Best Jazz Vocalist (twice, in 1996 and 1997) and Best Original Composition (1996).<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 21, 2008 |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=norah jones|bio=true}}|title=Norah Jones|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

Jones attended the [[University of North Texas]] (UNT), where she majored in jazz piano and sang with the UNT Jazz Singers. During this time, she had a chance meeting with future collaborator [[Jesse Harris]]. She gave a ride to a band playing at the university whose members happened to be friends of Harris. He was on a cross-country [[road trip]] with friend and future [[The Little Willies|Little Willies]] member Richard Julian, and stopped to see the band play. After meeting Jones, Harris started sending her [[lead sheet]]s of his songs.

In 1999, Jones left Texas for New York City. Less than a year later, she started a band with Harris, and her recordings with them were bestsellers.<ref>{{cite serial |accessdate=January 4, 2009 |url=http://128.163.130.14/woodsongs-318.wmv |title=Jesse Harris & Jennifer Daniels |series=WoodSongs Old Time Radio Hour|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327131351/http://128.163.130.14/woodsongs-318.wmv |archive-date=March 27, 2009  }}</ref>

===2000: The Peter Malick Group Session, ''New York City''===
{{Main|New York City (The Peter Malick Group album)}}
As Peter Malick states in the liner notes, "I started looking for a singer who might be open to recording [my latest songs] for me. On a Tuesday night, I walked into the Living Room just as the singer announced the last song of the set. The Dinah Washington classic 'Since I Fell for You' filled the room and I was struck breathless. Here, in the tradition of Billie Holiday, was a stunningly beautiful, blues infused voice. This was my first contact with Norah Jones."<ref name="NYC">{{cite AV media notes |title=New York City |others=The Peter Malick Group featuring Norah Jones |date=May 2003 |last=Malick |first=Peter |type=CD liner notes |publisher=[[E1 Music|Koch Records]] |id=KOC-CD-8678}}</ref> Malick asked her to participate in sessions at Room 9 from Outer Space in South Boston, Massachusetts, during August and September 2000. They recorded Malick's songs "New York City", "Strange Transmissions", "Deceptively Yours" and "Things You Don't Have to Do" in addition to cover versions of "All Your Love" by Sam Maghett and "Heart of Mine" by Bob Dylan. These songs became the album ''New York City'' ([[Koch Records|Koch]], 2003) by the Peter Malick Group Featuring Norah Jones.<ref name="NYC" />

===2001–2003: ''First Sessions'' and ''Come Away with Me''===

After moving to New York City, Jones signed to [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]], a label owned by [[EMI Group]]. The signing came as an indirect result of her performing as lead singer for the JC Hopkins Biggish Band. Shell White, who was the wife of [[J. C. Hopkins]], worked for [[EMI Publishing]] and gave Jones's three-track demo to [[Bruce Lundvall]], the label's president, and Brian Bacchus, its artists and repertoire agent ([[artists and repertoire|A&R]]). The demo contained two jazz standards and a song by [[Jesse Harris]]. The two executives agreed that Jones had potential. Despite their misgivings about the direction of her music, they signed her to the label. Bacchus told ''[[HitQuarters]]'', "We let her find her own direction...We knew that if she could develop her songwriting and we could find great songs, it would work."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_BBacchus.html |title=Interview With Brian Bacchus |date=September 3, 2002 |website=[[HitQuarters]] |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709132248/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_BBacchus.html |archive-date=July 9, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Bacchus thought producer and engineer [[Jay Newland]]'s experience in jazz, blues, rock, country, and folk music would give a "feeling for her sound." Jones and Newland recorded nine demo tracks. Four appeared on the sampler ''[[First Sessions]]'' (2001). The rest were set aside for her debut album.<ref name="hitquarters.com" />  ''[[Come Away with Me]]'' (2002) was praised for its blend of acoustic pop with soul and jazz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/rj9x/|title=BBC - Music - Review of Norah Jones - Come Away With Me|last=Shackleton|first=Kathryn|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=January 22, 2019}}</ref> Debuting at No.&nbsp;139, it reached No.&nbsp;1 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The single "[[Don't Know Why]]" hit No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Top 40 Adult]] Recurrents in 2003 and No.&nbsp;30 in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Singles Chart.

At the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003, Jones was nominated for eight Grammy Awards and won five: [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for "Don't Know Why". This tied [[Lauryn Hill]] and [[Alicia Keys]] for most Grammy Awards received by a female artist in one night. Jesse Harris won Song of the Year for "Don't Know Why" while [[Arif Mardin]] won [[Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical|Producer of the Year]].

{{Main|Not Too Late (album)}}
Jones released her third album, ''[[Not Too Late (album)|Not Too Late]]'', on January 30, 2007. The album was the first for which she wrote or co-wrote every song. She has said some of these songs are much darker than those on her previous albums.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Interview |series=[[60 Minutes]] |airdate=February 11, 2007}}</ref> ''Not Too Late'' was mostly recorded at Jones' home studio. It is her first album without producer Arif Mardin, who died in the summer of 2006. Jones described the sessions as "fun, relaxed and easy" and without a deadline; Blue Note executives reportedly did not know she was recording an album. The song "My Dear Country" is political commentary; she wrote it before the United States Presidential election day in 2004.

''Not Too Late'' reached the No.&nbsp;1 position in twenty countries. ''Not Too Late'' had the third-best first week of sales in 2007, behind [[Avril Lavigne]]'s ''[[The Best Damn Thing]]'' and [[Linkin Park]]'s ''[[Minutes to Midnight (Linkin Park album)|Minutes to Midnight]]''.

It takes you a little bit out of your comfort zone when you're doing something with another artist. You don't know what to expect—it's kind of like being a little kid and having a playdate."
