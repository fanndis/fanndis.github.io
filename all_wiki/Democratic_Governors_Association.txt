The '''Democratic Governors Association''' ('''DGA''') is a [[Washington, D.C.]] based [[527 organization]] founded in 1983, consisting of [[U.S. state]] and territorial [[List of current United States Governors|governors]] affiliated with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The mission of the organization is to provide party support to the election and re-election of Democratic gubernatorial candidates. The DGA's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] counterpart is the [[Republican Governors Association]]. The DGA is not directly affiliated with the non-partisan [[National Governors Association]]. Noam Lee is currently the Executive Director of the DGA.

==Founding and early years==
Previously known as the '''Democratic Governors Conference''' within the [[Democratic National Committee]], the DGA was founded by Virginia Governor [[Chuck Robb]] as an independent institution in 1983 with the help of Democratic National Committee Chairman [[Chuck Manatt]]. The purpose of the committee was to raise funds to elect Democrats to governorships and to improve the partnership between Democratic governors and the Democratic leadership of the House and Senate. Prior to its current formation in mid-1983, they met in a Democratic Governors Conference.

==1990s==
The DGA played a pivotal role in the election of [[Bill Clinton]] to the Presidency in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]]. Under the leadership of DGA Chair and Hawaii Governor [[John D. Waiheʻe III|John Waiheʻe]], the DGA helped organize Clinton's "winning the West" campaign tour through Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Nevada and California. Republicans had handily won in all but Washington and Oregon the previous three elections. According to ''The Washington Post'',<ref>[[Ann Devroy|Devroy, Ann]], [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74057220.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Oct+22%2C+1992&author=Ann+Devroy&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&edition=&startpage=a.16&desc=Clinton+Takes+His+Case+to+GOP%27s+Western+Stronghold%3B+At+Colorado+Rally%2C+Nominee+Explains+Plans+for+a+%60New%27+Democratic+Party "Clinton Takes His Case to GOP's Western Stronghold"], ''The Washington Post'', October 22, 1993, accessed August 8, 2011.</ref> it was "all but unthinkable to Republicans that the GOP could lose such stalwart pieces of the party's electoral base as Wyoming and Nevada." Clinton lost Wyoming but carried Nevada, Colorado, Montana, Washington, Oregon, and California.

The DGA reported raising over $20 million in 2011, almost doubling what it raised during the comparable 2007 election cycle.

Now.," DGA Chair [[Martin O'Malley]] said. Executive Director Colm O'Comartun added, "There is no doubt that we will face a challenging electoral environment in 2012, but our victories in 2011 showed that we know how to wisely and strategically deploy our resources. We are delighted with the continued support of everyone who believes in our mission of creating jobs and expanding opportunity now."<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Malley|first=Martin|title=DGA Continues to Break Fundraising Records|url=http://www.democraticgovernors.org/news/press_releases?id=0443}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
