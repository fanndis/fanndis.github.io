==Background and inspiration==
"Complicated" was written and produced by [[Tricky Stewart]] and [[Ester Dean]], for Rihanna's fifth studio album, ''Loud''. The song was recorded in 2010 at [[Westlake Recording Studios]], and [[Larrabee Sound Studios]], both located in [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref name="Album notes"/> In an interview with Sway Calloway for [[MTV]], Rihanna explained the meaning behind "Complicated" and how it is applicable for both men and women, saying:

{{quote|[Complicated is] not a sex thing. It's not like only women can sing this song or only women can relate to this song, 'cause it's an individual thing and sometimes, ''sometimes'' {{sic}} men are just too complicated and then again, men can find women complicated. But it all depends on the individual, because not all women think love is complicated and not all men think that, but there are some women and some men who strongly believe that love is just too complicated. Women, they're the first to say, 'It's your fault,' but most of the time it is [the man's] fault. But men are also great at turning that [shit] around on us and making us believe that we're wrong for something that we didn't even do. At the end of the day, love is [fucking] complicated.<ref name="ComplicatedMTVInterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1652326/rihanna-reveals-inspiration-loud-track-complicated.jhtml|title=Rihanna Reveals Inspiration For Loud's 'Complicated'|publisher=[[MTV]].

Nima Baniamer of Contactmusic.com praised Rihanna's vocal performance and liked it to single track from ''Loud'', "[[California King Bed]]", writing: "Taking a seat back from the thumping club classics, tracks like California King Bed and Complicated are both emotional singles that reveal Rihanna's surprisingly brilliant vocals."<ref name="ContactMusic">{{cite web|last=Baniamer|first=Nima|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/album-review/rihanna-loud|title=Rihanna - Loud Album Review|publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]]|accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> Baniamer also expressed that it would be a "travesty" if the song was not chosen as a single from the album.<ref name="ContactMusic"/> Genevieve Koski of ''[[The A.V.
