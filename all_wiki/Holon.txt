'''Holon''' ({{lang-he-n|חוֹלוֹן}} <small>{{Audio|Holon.ogg|(audio)}}</small>) is a city on the central coastal strip of [[Israel]], south of [[Tel Aviv]]. Holon is part of the metropolitan [[Gush Dan]] area. In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Holon}}.{{Israel populations|reference}} Holon has the second-largest [[industry (manufacturing)|industrial]] zone in Israel, after [[Haifa]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Etymology==
The name of the city comes from the [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] word {{Hebrew|חוֹלוֹן}} ''holon'', meaning "(little) [[sand]]". The name Holon also appears in the Bible: "And Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs" ([[Book of Joshua]], 21:15).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isrealli.org/the-story-of-holon-making-sand-dunes-sophisticated/ |title=The Story of Holon:Making Sand Dunes Sophisticated |publisher=Isrealli.org |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228164545/http://www.isrealli.org/the-story-of-holon-making-sand-dunes-sophisticated/ |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:THE KIRYAT AVODA SUBURB OF HOLON. הפרוור קרית עבודה בחולון.D27-090.jpg|thumb|left|Holon, 1938]]
[[File:Location holon.png|thumb|right|upright|100px|Location of Holon in the [[Tel Aviv District]]]]
Holon was founded on sand dunes six kilometers ({{convert|6|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from Tel Aviv in 1935.<ref name="autogenerated1">''The Guide to Israel'', Zeev Vilnay, Hamakor Press, Jerusalem, 1972, p.239</ref> The Łódzia textile factory was established there by Jewish immigrants from [[Łódź]], Poland, along with many other industrial enterprises.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> In the early months of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Holon was on the front line, with constant shooting taking place on the border with the village of [[Tel A-Rish]] to its northwest—a suburb of Arab [[Jaffa]]—and clashes also in the direction of the town of [[Yazur]] to the east. An attack by the Holon-based [[Haganah]] militia units on [[Operation Hametz|Tel A-Rish]] was repulsed with considerable losses. 

After the establishment of the state, Holon expanded to include Tel A-Rish (renamed "Tel Giborim", "The Mound of the Heroes") and the orange groves of [[Yazur]].

In February 2001, eight Israelis were killed and twenty-five were injured in a Palestinian attack on a crowded bus stop in Holon.<ref name="mfa.gov.il">{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+since+2000/Victims+of+Palestinian+Violence+and+Terrorism+sinc.htm |title=Victims of Palestinian Violence and Terrorism since September 2000 |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403024612/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-%20Obstacle%20to%20Peace/Palestinian%20terror%20since%202000/Victims%20of%20Palestinian%20Violence%20and%20Terrorism%20sinc.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The image of Holon as a working-class bedroom community has changed over the years. Through municipal efforts, the city has been rebranded as a child-friendly city, offering family attractions such as the Yamit Water Park, the Israeli Children's Museum and the Israel Museum of Caricature and Comics.<ref name="haaretz1">{{cite web|last=Bassok |first=Moti |url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/.premium-1.560837 |title=Working class Holon aims to attract affluent home buyers |publisher=Haaretz |date=November 29, 2013 |accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref>
