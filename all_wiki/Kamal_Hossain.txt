Educated at the [[University of Notre Dame]] and the [[University of Oxford]], he was called to the bar of England and Wales in [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1959. Hossain enrolled as an advocate in the [[Dhaka High Court|High Court]] of East Pakistan. He worked on cases with prominent Pakistani lawyers, including [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] and [[Mahmud Ali Kasuri]], early in his legal career. Hossain often worked on ''[[habeas corpus]]'' cases during the [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] regime. Between 1961 and 1968, he taught law at [[Dhaka University]]. Hossain was the legal counsel of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] and the [[Awami League]] during the [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]], and was elected vice-chairman of the [[Pakistan Bar Council]] in 1970. In 1971, he was part of the League's negotiation team for the transfer of power after the [[1970 Pakistani general election|1970 general election]]. Hossain was imprisoned in West Pakistan with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the war of independence that transformed East Pakistan into Bangladesh.

He served in Bangladesh's first post-independence government from 1972 to 1975, initially as [[Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs|law minister]] and chairman of the drafting committee in the [[Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh|Constituent Assembly]]. Hossain led the process which produced the 1972 [[Constitution of Bangladesh]].

As [[Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources|energy minister]], Hossain later enacted the Bangladesh Petroleum Act. He was a research fellow and visiting fellow at Oxford University during the late 1970s. In 1981, he ran as an opposition candidate for [[1981 Bangladeshi presidential election|president]] against [[Abdus Sattar (president)|Abdus Sattar]]. Hossain fell out with Awami League president [[Sheikh Hasina]] during the 1990s, and formed the Gono Forum (People's Forum) party.

He is a former vice-president of the [[International Law Association]], former president of the Bangladesh Supreme Court Bar Association; and chairman of the [[BLAST|Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust]] and the South Asian Institute of Advanced Legal and Human Rights Studies (SAILS).

==Early life and education==
Hossain's family is from Shaestabad in [[Barisal Division|Barisal]]; his grandfather, Syed Sadat Hossain, was the [[zamindar]] of Shaestabad.<ref name="alalodulal1">{{cite web|author=tokai |url=https://alalodulal.org/2014/07/11/kamal-hossain/ |title=History Wars: Kamal Hossain Interview (Part 1) – alalodulal |publisher=Alalodulal.org |date=27 November 2015 |accessdate=24 September 2018}}</ref> The area of Shaestabad was home to several Bengali zaminda. Hossain's father, Ahmed, was an early [[Bengali Muslim]] physician and [[MBBS]] holder in [[Calcutta]], [[Bengal Presidency]], [[British India]].<ref name="alalodulal1"/> The elder Hossain was a relative of [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], the third [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] and fifth [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]].<ref name="alalodulal1"/>

Kamal Hossain was born on 20 April 1937 in Calcutta. His family moved to [[Dhaka]], [[East Bengal]] in 1949 after the [[partition of British India]]. Hossain attended [[St. Gregory's High School]], where his classmates included the future academic [[Anisuzzaman]]. He received a two-year scholarship to the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[Indiana]], [[United States]] at age 16, and studied economics before pursuing a master's degree from the [[University of Michigan]]. Hossain's American classmates included [[Richard V. Allen]], future national security advisor to President Ronald Reagan.<ref name="alalodulal1"/> In the U.S., he joined the Pakistan Students Association with fellow Bengalis [[Nurul Islam (economist)|Nurul Islam]] and [[Golam Wahed Choudhury]]. Hossain was a member of the association's leadership committee, which was led by [[Munir Ahmed Khan]].<ref name="alalodulal1"/>

He has cited Justice [[Fazal Akbar]] as an inspiration to study law. Hossain moved to England from the U.S. in 1958, traveling to London by ship. In England, he met future professor [[Rehman Sobhan]]. In 1959, Hossain received a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] degree from the [[University of Oxford]] and enrolled as a barrister in [[Lincoln's Inn]]. He also enrolled as an advocate in the High Court of [[East Pakistan]]. Hossain received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in international law from Oxford in 1964, with his dissertation "State Sovereignty and the United Nations Charter".<ref name="alalodulal1"/>

== {{anchor|Pakistan (until 1971)}}East Pakistan ==
Hossain began his practice at Original (one of the oldest law firms on the Indian subcontinent, which had established a division in [[East Bengal]] during the 1950s), and was invited to join the firm by lawyer Abul Ahmad. At Original, Hossain worked with two Englishmen and Justice Mohammad Hossain. Hossain was at Original from 1959 to 1962, when he came into frequent contact with barrister and former prime minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. [[Pakistan]] had come under [[Martial law|military rule]] after a 1958 coup, and Hossain has recounted that he and Suhrawardy often zigzagged their car through Dhaka's streets to confuse (and evade) Pakistani-intelligence vehicles.<ref name="alalodulal1"/> Through Suhrawardy, Hossain came into contact with [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]]. He has said that Rahman predicted the collapse of Ayub Khan's regime in 10 years (which it did, in 1969).<ref name="alalodulal1"/>

Hossain defended [[Maulana Bhashani]] in a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' case. He was a lawyer for the English Rally brothers, who owned businesses in the [[Port of Narayanganj]], and worked on a case for Chandranath Films. In 1963, Hossain began independent practice as a barrister. He represented ''[[The Daily Ittefaq]]'', one of [[East Pakistan]]'s largest [[Bengali language|Bengali-language]] newspapers, when it was banned by the Pakistani government. East Pakistan Chief Justice [[Badruddin Ahmed Siddiky]] told Hossain's lead counsel [[Mahmud Ali Kasuri]] to give the floor to Hossain during the ''Ittefaq'' case,  and Kasuri obliged. The verdict favored Hossain and Kasuri.<ref name="alalodulal1"/>

He joined [[Dhaka University]]'s Department of International Relations as a part-time lecturer in 1961, and later taught [[international law]]. Hossain's academic work at the university continued until 1969,<ref name="alalodulal1"/> and he was a staunch supporter of the [[six point movement]].

During the [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]], Hossain prepared the writ petition and worked on the case with [[Queen's Counsel]] Thomas William.<ref name="alalodulal1"/> In 1967, 1968 and 1969, he was elected vice-chairman of the East Pakistan Bar Council (now the [[Bangladesh Bar Council]]). Hossain was elected the last vice-chairman of the All-[[Pakistan Bar Council]] in 1969.<ref name="alalodulal1"/> In 1969 and 1970, he was involved in the round-table conferences between the government of Pakistan and major opposition parties led by the Awami League and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.<ref name="alalodulal1"/>

Kamal Hossain was the Awami League's chief political negotiator.<ref name="dhakatribune1">{{cite news |author=Syed Badrul Ahsan |url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2018/10/31/story-of-a-political-negotiator |title=Story of a political negotiator |work=Dhaka Tribune |date=31 October 2018 |type=Opinion |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> After the [[1970 Pakistani general election]], Sheikh Mujib vacated one of his seats in Dacca and allowed Hossain to be elected to the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] from that seat. Hossain was considered one of Mujib's closest confidantes, along with [[Tajuddin Ahmad]].<ref name="dhakatribune1"/> Between January and March 1971, Hossain negotiated with Pakistan's Law Minister [[Alvin Robert Cornelius]] and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]]'s lawyer [[Abdul Hafeez Pirzada]] over the transfer of power.<ref>{{cite news |author=Syed Badrul Ahsan |url=https://opinion.bdnews24.com/2016/04/20/kamal-hossain-in-bangladeshs-history/ |title=Kamal Hossain in Bangladesh's history |work=bdnews24.com |type=Opinion |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>

Hossain was imprisoned in [[West Pakistan]]'s [[Central Prison Haripur]] during the 1971 [[Bangladesh War of Independence]]. He was released on 28 December 1971.<ref name="alalodulal2">{{cite web|author=tokai |url=https://alalodulal.org/2015/11/27/kamal-hossain-2/ |title=History Wars: Kamal Hossain Interview (Part 2) – alalodulal |publisher=Alalodulal.org |date= 28 November 2015|accessdate=24 September 2018}}</ref> After his release, he accompanied Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to [[London]] and [[New Delhi]], followed by a triumphant homecoming in an independent Bangladesh on 10 January 1972.<ref name="alalodulal2"/>

Hossain was appointed as the first law minister of the newly formed country. One of his chief responsibilities was to frame a [[constitution]]. He was chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee in the [[Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh]]. He was 35 years of age at the time, making him one of the youngest constitution drafters in the world. Hossain was credited for leading the successful completion of the constitution's drafting process.<ref name="dhakatribune2">{{cite news |author=Tanim Hussain Shawon |url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2018/11/03/the-conscientious-dr-kamal-hossain |title=The conscientious Dr Kamal Hossain |work=Dhaka Tribune |date=3 November 2018 |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> The [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] was approved on 4 November 1972 and came into force on 16 December 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://archive.thedailystar.net/forum/2010/November/dreams.htm |title=Forum |publisher=The Daily Star |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> The constitution included a bill of rights and professed [[parliamentary government]] (scrapped in 1975 and restored in 1991).

However, the constitution also included references to [[socialism]], including language such as "realise through the democratic process a socialist society". On socialism, Hossain said "socialism was very much within the democratic framework and not socialism in the sense of communism. That, again, I think, is something that in the context of our historical experience from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s was the big issue in those days". According to Hossain, the Awami League supported [[social democracy]] inspired by the politics of the [[British Labour Party]]. He recounted that socialism was an important political current in South Asia, especially during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|author=chrismoffat |url=https://commonwealthoralhistories.org/2015/interview-with-kamal-hossain/ |title=Interview with Kamal Hossain – Commonwealth Oral History Project |publisher=Commonwealthoralhistories.org |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref> For example, the [[Constitution of India|Indian constitution]] also includes references to socialism. The government of post-1971 leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto embarked on [[nationalization in Pakistan]]. The Dominion of [[Ceylon]] was proclaimed as the [[Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] in 1972.

Hossain served as a [[Member of Parliament]] from Dhaka in the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]]. He became the [[Foreign Minister of Bangladesh]] in 1973. Hossain secured Bangladesh's admission to the [[United Nations]] in 1974. The U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] called Hossain "another student of mine".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve08/d36 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969–1976, Volume E–8, Documents on South Asia, 1973–1976 – Office of the Historian |publisher=History.state.gov |date=30 September 1974 |accessdate=24 September 2018}}</ref>

Hossain was a signatory to the [[Delhi Agreement]] between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The agreement sought to normalize relations in the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] after the 1971 conflict. In the agreement, Pakistan pledged to release [[Internment|interned]] Bengali families in exchange for the return of [[POW|PoWs]] held by India and Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genocidebangladesh.org/text-of-the-tri-patriate-agreement-of-bangladesh-pakistan-india/ |title=Text of the tri-patriate agreement of Bangladesh-Pakistan-India |publisher=Bangladesh Genocide Archive |date=2 March 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> On dealing with neighboring India, Hossain has said "I had a great equation with Mrs [[Indira Gandhi]] and her foreign minister [[Swaran Singh]]. We discussed the knotty issue of [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves|land boundary]] with so much ease".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://indianexpress.com/article/world/bangladesh-election-i-am-no-challenger-just-working-to-restore-rule-of-law-democracy-in-bangladesh-says-kamal-hossain-5511116/ |title = Bangladesh election: I am no challenger… just working to restore rule of law, democracy in Bangladesh, says Kamal Hossain |work=The Indian Express |date = 27 December 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Kamal Hossain.png|thumb|Hossain speaking at the University of Dhaka in 2011]]
Hossain was also appointed as energy minister. The [[1973 oil crisis]] began to push developing countries like Bangladesh to explore their own oil and gas reserves. There was speculation of large reserves in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Hossain began to study the legal reforms needed for Bangladesh to launch a hydrocarbon industry. 40 foreign companies applied to explore the bay.<ref name="alalodulal2"/> Under Hossain's tenure in the ministry, [[Petrobangla]] was established. Hossain drafted the Bangladesh Petroleum Act after studying the laws of [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. The new law replaced colonial laws and introduced the Production Sharing Contract for multinational energy firms in the country.<ref name="alalodulal2"/>

Hossain offered to resign on several occasions because of pressure due to the Awami League's lobbying activities.<ref name="alalodulal2"/> However, he continued to serve in Mujib's cabinet, even after the creation of the one party system of [[BAKSAL]] that lasted for 6 months between January and August 1975, until the [[assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] on 15 August 1975.<ref name="alalodulal2"/> At the time of the Mujib's killing, Hossain was visiting [[Yugoslavia]] on a bilateral visit. He refused invitations to join the [[martial law]] government. Fearing for his life and rejecting calls to return, he moved to Oxford University for a period of teaching and research.<ref name="alalodulal1"/>

On BAKSAL, Hossain has said "Till 1971 I had not seen any differences between Mujib Bhai (the friend) and Bangabandhu (the leader). After 1972, he became the head of state. But, he never was both the head of the state and head of the party simultaneously. That change came later during the formation of BAKSAL. And that happened in a very complex situation. Through what dynamics he (Mujib) changed I cannot understand".<ref>{{cite web|author=tokai |url=https://alalodulal.org/2015/11/27/kamal-hossain-2/ |title=History Wars: Kamal Hossain Interview (Part 2) – alalodulal |publisher=Alalodulal.org |date= 28 November 2015|accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>

The next government, which assumed power after Mujib's killing, functioned as a [[junta (governing body)|junta]] for 3 years headed by a [[Chief Martial Law Administrator]]. In 1979, President [[Ziaur Rahman]] (who was army chief during the junta) restored [[multiparty]] politics, promoted [[free market]]s and pursued pro-Western, anti-Communist policies. The [[1979 Bangladeshi general election]] restored the country's parliament. Hossain returned to Bangladesh in the late 1970s during this period of political liberalization.

In 1981, Hossain was instrumental in orchestrating [[Sheikh Hasina]]'s return to Bangladesh from her exile in India (Hasina and [[Sheikh Rehana]] could not return to the country since their family's murder in 1975).<ref name="thewire1"/> He contested the [[1981 Bangladeshi presidential election]] as the Awami League's candidate. He lost to then incumbent [[Abdus Sattar (president)|Justice Abdus Sattar]], who had been acting president after the [[assassination of Ziaur Rahman]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Auerbach |first=Stuart |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/11/15/slain-leaders-haunt-bangladesh-campaign/aa3045d1-ecd4-47bb-86e3-a728f453c27d/?noredirect=on |title=Slain Leaders Haunt Bangladesh Campaign |work=The Washington Post |date=15 November 1981 |accessdate=24 September 2018}}</ref> Within a year of the election, Sattar was deposed by the military during the [[1982 Bangladesh coup d'état]]. At the time of President [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]]'s downfall in 1990, Hossain played a leading role in drawing up the Three-Alliance Roadmap for the restoration of [[parliamentary democracy]] after 15 years of [[presidential government]]. He was also involved in making the then chief justice [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]] the head of the transitional government.<ref name="dhakatribune2"/>
[[File:Kamal Hossain.jpg|thumb|Hossain (left) with political activists]]
In 1992, differences between Hossain and Awami League president [[Sheikh Hasina]] caused him to leave the party. He set up a small political party called [[Gano Forum]]. In 1996, when the Awami League and [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) were at loggerheads, Kamal Hossain and [[Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed]] devised a formula that culminated in the introduction of the system of [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker governance]] for holding general elections. Similar caretaker governments headed by judges were later adopted in [[Pakistan]], [[Greece]] and [[Bhutan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/his-majesty-appoints-interim-government/ |title=His Majesty appoints interim government |publisher=KuenselOnline |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref><ref>https://www.ft.com/content/e18e27e6-a012-11e1-90f3-00144feabdc0</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/world/pakistans-ex-chief-justice-nasirul-mulk-takes-oath-as-caretaker-prime-minister-5199966/ |title=Pakistan's ex-chief justice Nasirul Mulk takes oath as caretaker Prime Minister |work=The Indian Express |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>

In 2011, he defended Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]] in court following Hasina's decision to sack Yunus from the board of [[Grameen Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/report/yunus-challenges-removal-from-grameen-bank/20110303.htm |title=Yunus challenges removal from Grameen in Court – Rediff.com Business |publisher=Rediff.com |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> In 2018, Hossain defended the photographer [[Shahidul Alam]] in court after Alam was detained on charges of criticizing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newagebd.net/article/48006/hc-orders-further-health-examination-of-shahidul|title=HC orders further health examination of Shahidul|work=New Age}}</ref> Hossain has also supported the deposed chief justice [[Surendra Kumar Sinha]] who struck down a constitutional amendment allowing parliament to impeach supreme court judges.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/politics/news/court-inside-jail-absurd-dr-kamal-1633300 |title=Court inside jail absurd: Dr Kamal |work=The Daily Star |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mahmud |first=Faisal |url=http://www.atimes.com/article/book-by-ex-bangladesh-chief-justice-stirs-controversy/ |title=Book by ex-Bangladesh Chief Justice stirs controversy &#124; Asia Times |publisher=Atimes.com |date=26 September 2018 |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>

The official campaign period began on 8 November 2018. Previous free and fair elections in Bangladesh were usually a festive affair. Despite the dialogue and assurances of a peaceful election atmosphere from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the campaign period was marked by persecution of civil society, media and the opposition; and human rights abuses by security forces. [[Human Rights Watch]] noted that "widespread surveillance and a crackdown on speech, have contributed to a climate of fear extending from prominent voices in society to ordinary citizens."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/12/22/creating-panic/bangladesh-election-crackdown-political-opponents-and-critics |title=Bangladesh Election Crackdown on Political Opponents and Critics |publisher=HRW |date= 22 December 2018|accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref> The Awami League's affiliated student and youth wings mobilized its members who were armed with bamboo poles to attack the opposition.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/bangladesh-national-election-2018/mirza-abbas-comes-under-attack-during-general-election-campaign-in-shegunbagicha-dhaka-1673959 |title=Mirza Abbas comes under attack during general election campaign |work=The Daily Star |date=15 December 2018 |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref> Hossain's motorcade was attacked on 14 December 2018.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/world/bangladesh-senior-opposition-leader-kamal-hossains-motorcade-attacked-in-mirpur-5494048/ |title=Bangladesh: Senior opposition leader's motorcade attacked in Mirpur |work=The Indian Express |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref>

The [[2018 Bangladeshi general election]] was held amid widespread allegations of vote rigging, ballot box stuffing and intimidation of opposition polling agents.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46718393 |title=Bangladesh election: PM Sheikh Hasina wins landslide in disputed vote |work=BBC News |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref> Hossain said "There was an unprecedented vote robbery, which is a mockery of democracy.

He said "We need a united movement of citizens, political parties and human rights organizations that are committed to the realization of human rights and the institutionalization of democracy in the country. I hope the international community will take note of the current situation in Bangladesh. And on the basis of the [[United Nations Charter]] and resolutions, it shouldn't recognize any government which doesn't have the consent of the people".<ref>I hope the international community will take note of the current situation in Bangladesh.

During the 2018 election campaign, Shah Ali Farhad, who works in the Awami League's Centre for Research and Information, wrote in the Bangla Tribune that Kamal Hossain was a "not so conscientious" politician.<ref name="banglatribune1">{{cite news |title=The not so conscientious Dr. Kamal Hossain |url=http://en.banglatribune.com/opinion/opinion/16141/The-not-so-conscientious-Dr.-Kamal-Hossain |accessdate=17 December 2018 |work=Bangla Tribune |type=Opinion |language=en}}</ref> He criticized Hossain for holding the presidency of Gono Forum since its founding, arguing that the party had "no prospects of a new leadership in sight".<ref name="banglatribune1"/> Hossain has been labelled a "Pakistani collaborator" and a "[[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]]" Muslim,<ref name="dhakatribune3">{{cite news |title=The knives are out |url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2018/11/07/the-knives-are-out |accessdate=17 December 2018 |work=Dhaka Tribune |date=7 November 2018}}</ref> despite being one of Bangladesh's founding leaders and a [[Sunni]] Muslim. He has been accused of betraying the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.<ref name="dhakatribune3"/>

Arun Kumar Goswami, a political science professor at [[Jagannath University]], criticized Hossain for not being a mass leader, stating "The politics Dr. Kamal Hossain wants to introduce would not work in Bangladesh. You cannot succeed in politics here without having connection with the people". Goswami was in turn refuted by [[Moudud Ahmed]], who stated "I can refer a number of politicians who succeeded with lesser contact with people than that of Dr. Kamal Hossain".<ref>{{cite news |title=Political Protégé of Bangladesh PM's Father Vows to 'Restore Democracy' |url=https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/bengali/bangladesh-politics-10192018194058.html |accessdate=17 December 2018 |work=BenarNews |language=en}}</ref>

In response to Hossain's demand for a caretaker government in 2018, Sheikh Hasina said such a provision was not included in Bangladesh's first constitution drafted by Hossain himself under her father's tenure.<ref name="thedailystar2"/> The BNP responded to this charge by pointing out that Hasina herself led the campaign for starting caretaker governance for elections in 1996.<ref name="thedailystar2"/> Former president [[A. Q. M. Badruddoza Chowdhury]] and his son [[Mahi B. Chowdhury]] initially supported Hossain as part of the National Unity Front, but later switched to support for the Awami League and began to criticize Hossain's political ambitions.

During a hearing in the Supreme Court in 2017, Hossain used an expletive against Attorney General [[Mahbubey Alam]] and was censured by chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dr Kamal Hossain calls attorney general 'bastard' at chief justice's court |url=https://m.bdnews24.com/en/detail/bangladesh/1336334? |accessdate=17 December 2018 |work=bdnews24.com |language=en}}</ref>
