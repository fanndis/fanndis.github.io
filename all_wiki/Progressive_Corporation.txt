==History==
Progressive was founded in 1937 by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green as Progressive Insurance Company. Starting in 1956, the company found a niche by insuring more risky drivers. In 1965, [[Peter B. Lewis]], son of Joseph Lewis, and his mother borrowed $2.5 million, pledging their majority stake as collateral, and completed a [[leveraged buyout]] of Progressive.<ref name=AmerPolicyRoundtable>[http://www.aproundtable.org/library/articles/life/peter_lewis.html American Policy Roundtable: "Peter B.

==Segments==
The company operates in three segments: Personal Lines, Commercial Auto, and Other-[[indemnity]].

* The Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, [[motorcycle]]s, boats, and [[recreational vehicle]]s through both an independent [[agency (law)|agency]] channel and a direct channel. 
* The Commercial Auto segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by businesses primarily through the independent agency channel. 
* The Other-indemnity segment provides [[professional liability insurance]] to community [[bank]]s, principally directors, and officers liability insurance. It also provides insurance-related services, primarily providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans. In 2011, the company was ranked 164 in the [[Fortune 500]].<ref name=Rank>{{cite web | url = https://armstronginsflorida.com/index.php?sec=blog/522-progressive-insurance-corporation| title = Progressive Corporation | accessdate = 7 April 2020 | work = Armstrong }}</ref>

==Industry information==
Progressive is one of the largest auto insurers in the United States, with over 13 million policies in force,<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090227030514/http://investors.progressive.com/pdf/mreport-0109.pdf].</ref> along with [[State Farm Insurance|State Farm]], [[Allstate]], [[GEICO]], [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company]], [[Farmers Insurance Group]], and [[USAA]]. Progressive primarily offers its services through the Internet or by phone and through independent insurance agents. Progressive's Agency business sells insurance through more than 30,000 independent insurance agencies and ''progressiveagent.com'' where customers can quote their own policies and then contact an agent to complete the sale.

In December 2009, Progressive announced it was selling car insurance in [[Australia]].<ref>[http://newsroom.progressive.com/2009/december/progressive-enters-australia.aspx].</ref> Initially called Progressive Direct, it rebranded as Progressive in 2011, and later rebranded as PD Insurance in 2019.<ref>[http://www.progressiveonline.com.au].</ref>

==Marketing and operations==
Progressive's marketing campaign is known for offering quotes of its competitors along with its own quote. It was the first major insurer to offer auto policies through the phone and through its web site. In September 2007 Progressive began to offer Pet Injury coverage, which provides coverage for dogs and cats that are injured in a crash and is included at no additional cost with Collision coverage.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack W.

Immediate Response Vehicles (IRVs) used by Progressive are specially modified [[Ford Explorer]]s and [[Ford Escape]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Plunkett's Insurance Industry Almanac 2006: The Only Complete Reference To The Insurance And Risk Management Industry |isbn=978-1-59392-038-8|year=2005|author=Jack W.

==Advertising==
Progressive's television advertisements feature an overly enthusiastic cashier named [[Flo (Progressive Insurance)|Flo]] (played by actress [[Stephanie Courtney]]), who explains the benefits of Progressive Insurance.<ref>Garcia, Chris. [http://www.austin360.com/tv/content/tv/stories/2008/10/1020progressive.html "The Strange Allure of the Progressive Insurance Girl"]. ''Austin American-Statesman'', 20 October 2008.</ref><ref>Inman, David. [http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/general/view.bg?articleid=1138829 "TV Q&A with David Inman"]. ''Boston Herald'', 14 December 2008.</ref> In December 2010, the company introduced the "Messenger," as a complementary campaign. He was played by John Jenkinson.<ref>Elliott, Stuart. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/business/media/01adco.html?_r=1&ref=progressivecorporation A Nomadic Insurance Pitchman, Luring New Customers"]. ''New York Times'', 30 November 2010.</ref> The Flo universe also includes Jamie, an awkward fellow Progressive employee; and Bill and Tom, rival insurance salesmen from the figurative [[straw man]] "A. Nother Insurance Company." Bill and Tom were largely discontinued after [[Allstate]] filed a claim with the [[Better Business Bureau]] alleging that Progressive was making a false claim that they offered discounts that Allstate and other insurance providers did not.<ref>[https://asrcreviews.org/nad-recommends-progressive-discontinue-certain-advertising-claims-made-in-comparative-context-following-challenge-from-allstate/ NAD recommends Progressive discontinue certain advertising claims made in comparative context following challenge from Allstate], May 13, 2013</ref>

In 2012, Progressive introduced another character, a personified box (voiced by [[Chris Parnell]]) representing the company's products. It is portrayed as having an entourage (including a personal trainer).<ref name="adage-thebox">{{cite web|title=Flo Gets More Company as Progressive Rolls Out 'The Box'|url=http://adage.com/article/news/flo-company-progressive-rolls-box/238621/|website=Advertising Age|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> Progressive later added more characters like Flobot, Mara, Dr. Rick, and Motaur to its advertising series.

In Australia, Progressive uses a female character named "Kitty."  She is styled similar to Flo.

According to a February 2011 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article, Progressive has a leg up on its rivals in Pay As You Drive insurance, a form of vehicle insurance also generically known as usage-based insurance.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704775604576120361954865544?ru=yahoo | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Erik | last=Holm | title=How Am I Driving? Insurers May Know | date=February 4, 2011}}</ref> Progressive has seven U.S. patents covering usage-based insurance methods and systems, with more patents pending. Progressive began working on the concept in the mid-1990s and continues to refine the concept and bring it to the mass market.

Snapshot is Progressive's [[Pay As You Drive]], or [[usage-based insurance]] program. Snapshot is a voluntary discount program where drivers can save money on their car insurance by sharing their driving habits with Progressive. According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day.<ref name="progressive.com">[http://www.progressive.com/snapshot/].</ref> Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.progressive.com/auto/snapshot-how-it-works/</ref>

Drivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they're eligible for a discount based on that 30-day "snapshot" of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn't take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Snapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina.<ref name="progressive.com"/> Most recently, Snapshot became available in Indiana in May 2015.

==Corporate sponsorship==
On December 13, 2006, the company said earnings rose 58 percent in November as the company retained more of the premiums it collected because of comparisons to a month affected by Hurricane Katrina claims.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=817200add6ee008536504a101d6abff6&docnum=1&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzk-zSkAb&_md5=740b17f227435ca6ef55bf763b67ed8c |title= Progressive Nov.

The lawyer for the Fisher family countered by noting that two of the three witnesses were not independent, saying "I have an issue with how they examined the evidence to abandon their insured" and introduced the idea the state [[insurance commissioner]] could find Progressive had acted in bad faith. As noted, Progressive lost the case and was ordered to pay the underinsured motorist claim in addition to a separate settlement with the Fisher family "to avoid a hearing before the state insurance commissioner".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/your-money/progressives-side-of-the-insurance-case-that-blew-up-on-the-internet.html |title=The Auto Insurance Case That Blew Up on the Internet |author=Lieber, Ron |date=17 August 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref>
