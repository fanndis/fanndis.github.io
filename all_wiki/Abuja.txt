== History ==
[[File:National Assembly Building with Mace, Abuja, Nigeria.jpg|thumb|[[National Assembly (Nigeria)|National Assembly]] Building with Mace, Abuja, Nigeria]]

"Abuja" was in the earlier 20th century the name of the nearby town now called [[Suleja]].<ref name="fcda-about">{{cite web|title=The New Federal Capital|url=http://fcda.gov.ng/index.php/about-fcda/the-new-federal-capital|website=fcda.gov.ng|language=en-gb|date=2018}}</ref>

The indigenous inhabitants of Abuja are the [[Gbagyi]] (Gwari), with the [[Gbagyi language]] formerly the major of the region language, and others in the area being Bassa, [[Gwandara]], [[Gade (language)|Gade]], [[Dibo]], Nupe and [[Nkoroo language|Koro]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}In light of the ethnic and religious [[Demographics of Nigeria|divisions of Nigeria]], plans had been devised since Nigeria's independence to have its capital in a place deemed neutral to all major ethnic parties, and also in close proximity to all the regions of Nigeria. The location was eventually designated in the centre of the country in the early 1970s as it signified neutrality and national unity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Another impetus for Abuja came because of [[Lagos]]' population boom that made that city overcrowded and conditions squalid.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Makinde |first1=Adeyinka |title=Abuja: Constructing Nigeria's Federal Capital {{!}} Ambitious Plans, Corrupt Practices {{!}} 1983 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPxOIU0-nlE&ab_channel=AdeyinkaMakinde |website=Youtube |publisher=Youtube |accessdate=6 September 2020}}</ref> As Lagos was already undergoing rapid economic development, the Nigerian regime felt the need to expand the economy towards the inner part of the country, and hence decided to move its capital to Abuja.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/574434-nigeriaat55-top-5-reasons-nigerias-capital-moved-lagos-abuja-photos.html|title=#NigeriaAt55: Top 5 Reasons Nigeria's Capital Was Moved From Lagos To Abuja (PHOTOS)|first=Omotayo|last=Yusuf|date=1 October 2015}}</ref> The logic used was similar to the way [[Brazil]] planned its capital, [[Brasília]].

The Federal Military Government of Nigeria, promulgated decree No. 6 on the 4th of February, 1976, which initiated the removal of the Federal Capital from Lagos to Abuja.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Jonathan |title=The Political History of Nigeria's New Capital |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |date=March 1984 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=167–175 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00056846 |jstor=160334 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/160334 |accessdate=23 September 2020}}</ref><ref name="naij-why">{{cite web|last1=Yusuf|first1=Omotayo|title=Why The Capital Was Moved From Lagos To Abuja|url=https://www.naija.ng/574434-nigeriaat55-top-5-reasons-nigerias-capital-moved-lagos-abuja-photos.html#574434|website=Naija.ng – Nigeria news.|date=1 October 2015}}</ref> The initial work for Abuja's planning and implementation were carried out by the Military Government of General's [[Murtala Mohammed]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] and carried over into the Administration of Shehu Shagari.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Jonathan |title=The Political History of Nigeria's New Capital |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |date=March 1984 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=167–175 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00056846 |jstor=160334 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/160334 |accessdate=23 September 2020}}</ref>  Construction started in the late 1970s but, due to economic and political instability, the initial stages of the city were not complete until the late 1980s.

The move of Nigeria's Capital to Abuja was controversial, and the biggest opposition to it was led by [[Obafemi Awolowo]].<ref name="jstor.org">{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Jonathan |title=The Political History of Nigeria's New Capital |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |date=March 1984 |volume=22 |issue=1 |page=173 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00056846 |jstor=160334 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/160334?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents |accessdate=22 September 2020}}</ref> Awolowo, as a politician and a representative of the Yoruba people, defended their claims against the move of the Capital from Lagos. During the hotly-contested campaign for presidency, he vowed to hire the American Walt Disney Corporation to convert the new site (Abuja) into an amusement park if he was elected.<ref name="jstor.org"/> However, after his election as president, Alhaji [[Shehu Shagari]] showed a lot of support for the project and pushed for its early completion. His first journey outside of Lagos after his election was to Abuja, where he visited contractors and workers on site to urge a speedy completion of the project. On his return, he confided in Alhaji [[Abubakar Koko]] his disappointment with the slow progress of work.<ref name="jstor.org"/> Shehu Shagari rescheduled the planned relocation to Abuja from 1986 to 1982 which later proved difficult.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Jonathan |title=The Political History of Nigeria's New Capital |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |date=March 1984 |volume=22 |issue=1 |page=174 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00056846 |jstor=160334 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/160334?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents |accessdate=22 September 2020}}</ref>
 
The International Planning Associates (IPA) was commissioned in June, 1977, by the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) to produce the Abuja Master Plan and its regional grid.<ref>{{cite book|last=Elleh|first= Nnamdi|title= Abuja, the single most ambitious urban design project of the 20th century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=huHVAAAAMAAJ&q=+%22Wallace%2C+McHarg%2C+Roberts+and+Todd%22|year= 2001}}</ref> According to the terms of reference, the master planning process was to include a review of relevant data, selection of a capital city site, preparation of regional and city plans and the accompanying design and development standards manual.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shuaibu |first1=Umar |title=Unsung heroes of Abuja master plan |url=https://viewpointhousingnews.com/2020/03/16/unsung-heroes-of-abuja-master-plan/ |accessdate=22 September 2020}}</ref>

IPA did not exist prior to the Nigerian Government's engagement for an internationally reputable firm to design the master plan. IPA was formed by a consortium of three American firms which won the worldwide competitive bidding. The firms were Planning Research Corporation (PRC), Wallace, McHarg, Roberts and Todd, and Archisystems (a division of the Hughes Organisation). After winning the bid, and completing the project, the firms were disbanded.

The final report was submitted to the pioneer Executive Secretary of FCDA, Alhaji [[Abubakar Koko]], on February 15, 1979. In the preface to the master plan, the following declaration was made by IPA: 
{{Quote|text="The master plan for Abuja the new Capital City of Nigeria represents the culmination of 18 months’ work by the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) board, several advisory panels consultants. Without the unstinting efforts of these experts, the momentum now exhibited in the beginning of actual implementation of the new capital could not have been achieved. The plan itself represents a milestone in the process of building the new capital city. It is a necessary element in the monumental effort about to be undertaken by the Nigerian people."}}

The master plan for Abuja defined the general structure and major design elements of the city that are now visible. More detailed design of the central areas of the capital, particularly its monumental core, was accomplished by Japanese architect [[Kenzo Tange]], with his team of city planners at Kenzo Tange and Urtec company.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

Abuja under [[Köppen climate classification]] features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Aw''). The FCT experiences three weather conditions annually. This includes a warm, humid [[rainy season]] and a blistering [[dry season]]. In between the two, there is a brief interlude of [[harmattan]] occasioned by the northeast trade wind, with the main feature of [[Haze|dust haze]] and dryness.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The rainy season begins from April and ends in October, when daytime temperatures reach {{convert|28|°C|°F|1}} to {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}}  and nighttime lows hover around {{convert|22|°C|°F|1}} to {{convert|23|°C|°F|1}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} In the dry season, daytime temperatures can soar as high as {{convert|40|°C|°F|1}} and nighttime temperatures can dip to {{convert|12|°C|°F|1}}. Even the chilliest nights can be followed by daytime temperatures well above {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}}. The high altitudes and undulating terrain of the FCT act as a moderating influence on the weather of the territory. The city's inland location causes the [[diurnal temperature variation]] to be much larger than coastal cities with similar climates such as [[Lagos]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Rainfall in the FCT reflects the territory's location on the windward side of the [[Jos Plateau]] and the zone of rising air masses with the city receiving frequent rainfall during the rainy season from April to October every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.touristlink.com/nigeria/abuja/overview.html |title=Abuja Nigeria Tourist Information |publisher=Touristlink.com |accessdate=2013-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324021818/http://www.touristlink.com/nigeria/abuja/overview.html |archive-date=24 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Vegetation===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
The FCT falls within the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] zone of the West African sub-region. Patches of [[rain forest]], however, occur in the Gwagwa plains, especially in the rugged terrain to the southeastern parts of the territory, where a landscape of gullies and rough terrain is found. These areas of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) form one of the few surviving occurrences of the mature forest vegetation in Nigeria.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

For ease and co-ordination of developmental efforts, the city was divided into 'Phases' by its planners, with the city's development taking a concentric form with Phase 1, which consists of the city's inner districts-Central Area, Maitama, Asokoro, Wuse, Wuse II, Garki, Garki II, Guzape and Guzape II-at its core spreading out from the foot of Aso Rock, while Phase 5, consisting of the newly created Kyami District covering the vicinity of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport and the permanent campus of the University of Abuja, over 40 kilometres west of Aso Rock. Each Phase is separated from the other by an expressway (some still under construction); for example, Phases 1 and 2 are separated from each other by the Nnamdi Azikiwe expressway, while the entirety of the city proper (Phases 1–5) are enclosed by the Murtala Muhammed (Outer Northern-ONEX and Outer Southern-OSEX) expressways as well as the Federal A2 highway which traverses the Federal Capital Territory on its way to Kaduna (north-bound) and Lokoja (south-bound). Thus there is an integration of the city's road network with the Federal highway network, providing access to the immediate outlying countryside and the surrounding states of the country i.e. Niger State to the west, Kaduna State to the north, Nasarawa State to the east and Kogi State to the south.

The Phase 1 area of the city is divided into ten districts known as [[cadastre|cadastral]] zones.<ref name="abuja-ng.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.abuja-ng.com/contactus.html|title=Contact Us|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Abuja Stadium 4.jpg|thumbnail|Spectators at a football match held in the [[Abuja National Stadium]]]]

The Abuja skyline is made up of mostly mid-range and a few tall buildings. Only recently have tall buildings begun to appear. Most of the buildings are modern, reflecting that it is a new city.

Plans were made to build [[skyscraper]]s such as the [[Millennium Tower (Abuja)|Millennium Tower]] which is partly completed as work has stalled for the last few years. This structure looms {{Convert|170|m}} above the city. The tower is part of a huge cultural development complex called the Nigeria National Complex including the Nigeria Cultural Centre, a {{Convert|120000|m2|abbr=on|adj=on}} structure dedicated to the art and culture of Nigeria. The Cultural Centre and the Millennium Tower have been designed by the Italian architect [[Manfredi Nicoletti]].

Landmarks include the [[Millennium Tower (Abuja)|Millennium Tower]], the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] headquarters, the [[Nigerian Presidential Complex]], the Ship House, the [[Abuja National Stadium|National Stadium]], which was the main venue of the 2003 All Africa Games and some games, including the final, of the 2009 FIFA Under-17 World Cup, [[Abuja National Mosque|National Mosque]], the [[National Church of Nigeria|National Church]], [[Aso Rock]] and [[Zuma Rock]].

====Bush Bars====
Abuja has a variety of informal spaces known as "Bush Bars" that usually, though not always, include a covered area with tables and chairs where people can sit and have drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and sometimes there are snacks such as suya, grilled catfish, pounded yam, egusi soup and other small items available for purchase. They are located all over Abuja.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy|title=Sunday, August 27, 2006 Abuja bush bars|url=http://www.naijablog.co.uk/2006/08/abuja-bush-bars.html|accessdate=22 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223312/http://www.naijablog.co.uk/2006/08/abuja-bush-bars.html|archive-date=2 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nigerian Suya Recipe: For Nigerians in Diaspora|url=http://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/snacks/nigerian-suya-recipe.html|publisher=allnigerianrecipes.com|year=2013}}</ref>

===Central Business District===
Abuja's [[Central District, Abuja|Central District]], also called Central Area, is a strip of land stretching from [[Aso Rock]] in the east to the National stadium and the Old City gate in the West.It is like the city's spinal cord, dividing it into the northern sector with Maitama and Wuse, and the southern sector with Garki and Asokoro. While each district has its own clearly demarcated commercial and residential sectors, the Central District is the city's principal Business Zone, where practically all parastatals and [[multinational corporations]] have their offices. An attractive area in the Central District is the region known as the '''Three Arms Zone''', so called because it houses the administrative offices of the executive, legislative and judicial arms of the federal government. A few of the other sites worth seeing in the area are the federal secretariats alongside Shehu Shagari Way, Aso Hill, the Abuja Plant Nursery, [[Eagle Square, Abuja|Eagle Square]] (which has important historic significance, as it was in this grounds that the present democratic dispensation had its origin on 29 May 1999) and in which all subsequent Presidential Inauguration ceremonies have taken place. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated across Shehu Shagari Way facing the Eagle Square. This section is usually closed to traffic during the annual Armed Forces Remembrance Day ceremonies that is observed on 15 January. The [[Abuja National Mosque|National Mosque]] and [[National Church of Nigeria]] are opposite each other on either side of Independence Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/street/16260013/Independence-Ave |title=Independence Avenue |publisher=Wikimapia.org |date=2012-11-18 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref> A well-known government office is the Ministry of Defense, colloquially nicknamed "Ship House".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/9452603/Ministry-of-Defense-Ship-House |title=Ship House |publisher=Wikimapia.org |date=2012-11-18 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref> Also located here is the yet-to-be-completed National Square, Millennium tower and Nigeria Cultural Centre multi-functional complex.

The [[Garki District, Abuja|Garki District]] is the area in the southwest corner of the city, having the Central District to the north and the Asokoro District to the east. The district is subdivided into units called "Areas". Garki uses a distinctive naming convention of "Area" to refer to parts of Garki. These are designated as Areas 1 to 11. Garki II is used to differentiate the area from Garki Area 2.  Visitors may find this system confusing.

Garki is presently the principal business and administrative district of Abuja. Numerous buildings of interest are in this area. Some of them include the General Post Office, Abuja International Conference Centre along the busy Herbert Maculay Way, Nicon Luxury Hotel (formally known as Abuja Sofitel Hotel and Le Meridian), Agura Hotel and Old Federal Secretariat Complex Buildings (Area 1).

The [[Nigerian Television Authority]] (NTA) stations and corporate headquarters are also in Garki. The Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) which oversees and runs the Administration of the Federal Capital Territory has its offices in Garki.

The Office of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja is in Area 11. This is the location of the Federal Capital Development Authority and other administrative buildings. A popular sub-neighbourhood here is found in the vicinity of Gimbiya street, because it has the unique characteristic of being a purely administrative zone on weekdays, while transforming into a purely entertainment zone on weeknights and weekends.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Abuja City Tour Guide|url=https://mmmhouse.org/abuja-city-tour-guide/|website=mmmHouse Abuja!|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>

Maitama II has a high net worth individuals especially legislators as allottees, which makes it a destination for real estate investors who desire to secure the future today.

It is not very clear what the government plans for the district as no much has been said by government agents, but cadastral zoning A indicates the government has good plans for Maitama 2 to correct some errors in Maitama District.

It was learnt that plots of land were revoked from allottees of Mpape district to create the new Maitama II District, although a compensation plan is underway to relocate the revoked allottees to another district the government intends to create. Fortunately, some developers of the Mpape district who have building plan approval and have started building maintain their plots and allocations and are covered in the Maitama II District layout. It is not clear though if a fresh allocation bearing Maitama II District has been issued this set of allottees.

Notable landmarks of Maitama 2 district is Jubilation Avenue, Mount Pleasant Haven and Hilltop Estate.

The district infrastructure is in top gear as the Federal Government had in the 2018 and 2019 budget allocated about N1.3b for the engineering design of the district. Villages around the district are leaving in fear of demolition at any time with the information reaching them that government will commence the infrastructure project of Maitama II District.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maitama II Infrastructure to Commence Soon |url=https://leadership.ng/2020/08/21/provision-of-infrastructure-in-maitama-2-to-commence-soon/ |website=leadership.ng}}</ref>

=== Conurbation ===
Abuja has witnessed a huge influx of people into the city; the growth has led to the emergence of satellite towns, such as [[Karu Urban Area]], [[Suleja]], Gwagwalada, Lugbe, [[Kuje]] and smaller settlements towards which the planned city is sprawling. The urban agglomeration centred upon Abuja had a population estimated at 2,440,000 in 2014.<ref name="Demographia">{{cite book|author1=Demographia|title=Demographia World Urban Areas|date=January 2015|edition=11th|url=http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref> The [[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|metropolitan area of Abuja]] was estimated in 2016 as six million persons, the country's second most populous metro area.<ref name="Jaiyeola">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/03/29/fct-minister-harps-on-development-of-satellite-towns/ |title=FCT Minister Harps on Development of Satellite Towns |last=Jaiyeola |first=Andrews |access-date=22 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806020432/http://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/03/29/fct-minister-harps-on-development-of-satellite-towns/ |archive-date=6 August 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The city has a large and growing immigrant community consisting mainly of nationals from the ECOWAS sub-region.
