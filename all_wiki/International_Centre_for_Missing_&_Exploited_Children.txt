The '''International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children''' ('''ICMEC'''), headquartered in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], with a regional presence in Brazil and Singapore, is a private [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-governmental]], [[nonprofit]] global organization. It combats [[child sexual exploitation]], [[child pornography]], and [[child abduction]].

Formed in 1998, ICMEC heads a global missing children's network of 29 countries. The organization has trained law enforcement personnel from 121 countries, works with law enforcement in over 100 countries, and has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child sexual abuse material. ICMEC also encourages the creation of national operational centers built on a [[public-private partnership]] model, and leads global financial and industry coalitions to eradicate child sexual exploitation and child pornography.

The Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy is the International Centre's research arm. In August 2008, ICMEC was granted "Special Consultative Status" by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC), to assist the UN with its expertise regarding child sexual exploitation and child abduction. ICMEC also works with the [[intergovernmental organization]] [[INTERPOL]], the inter-continental organization the [[Organization of American States]] (the OAS), and the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]].

==History==
In 1998, the Board of Directors of the United States' [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] (NCMEC) approved the creation of the International Centre; the two now act as sister organizations.<ref name=missweb>{{cite web|url=http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/PublicHomeServlet|title=Missing Children Website|access-date=November 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315033044/http://icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/PublicHomeServlet|archive-date=March 15, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/n/national-center-for-missing-and-exploited-children/|title=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children; Law & Legal Definition|publisher=uslegal.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findmadeleine.com/missing_children/missing-children-organisations.html|title=Missing Children Organizations; ICMEC (International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children) |publisher=Find Madeleine}}</ref><ref name=hist>{{cite web|url=http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&PageId=3284|title=The Creation of ICMEC|publisher=ICMEC|access-date=November 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205172049/http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&PageId=3284|archive-date=December 5, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  ICMEC combats [[child sexual exploitation]], [[child pornography]], and [[child abduction]].<ref name=investigating>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7oM6P0ur7wC&pg=PA167|title=Investigating Missing Children Cases: A Guide for First Responders and Investigators|year=2012|pages=167–68|author=Donald F.
