==History==
===Early years===
During the 1980s, the Chinese government tried to modernize the country's underdeveloped telecommunications infrastructure. A core component of the telecommunications network was telephone exchange switches, and in the late 1980s, several Chinese research groups endeavored to acquire and develop the technology, usually through joint ventures with foreign companies.

Ren Zhengfei, a former deputy director of the [[People's Liberation Army]] engineering corps, founded Huawei in 1987 in Shenzhen. The company reports that it had [[RMB]] 21,000 (about $5,000 at the time) in registered capital from Ren Zhengfei and five other investors at the time of its founding where each contributed RMB 3,500.<ref name="Ash Center">{{Cite web |title=Huawei, a self-made world-class company or agent of China's global strategy? |url=https://ash.harvard.edu/huawei-self-made-world-class-company-or-agent-chinas-global-strategy |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200611082008/https://ash.harvard.edu/huawei-self-made-world-class-company-or-agent-chinas-global-strategy |archive-date=11 June 2020 |access-date=11 Jun 2020 |website=Ash Center}}</ref>They include Mei Zhongxing, manager at Shenzhen Sanjiang Electronics Co.; Zhang Xiangyang, a member of the Shenzhen Bureau of Development Planning; Wu Huiqing, an accountant at Shenzhen Petrochemical Co.; Shen Dingzing, a manager at Zhuhai Communications Equipment Manufacturing Co.; and Chen Jinyang, a manager in the trade department of the state-run China Travel Service in Shenzhen. These five initial investors gradually withdrew their investments in Huawei.

Ren sought to [[reverse-engineering|reverse engineer]] foreign technologies with local researchers. At a time when all of China's telecommunications technology was imported from abroad, Ren hoped to build a domestic Chinese telecommunication company that could compete with, and ultimately replace, foreign competitors.<ref>Peilei Fan, "Catching Up through Developing Innovation Capacity: Evidence from China's Telecom Equipment Industry," Technovation 26 (2006): 359–368</ref>

The company's first major breakthrough came in 1993 when it launched its C&C08 program controlled telephone switch. It was by far the most powerful switch available in China at the time. By initially deploying in small cities and rural areas and placing emphasis on service and customizability, the company gained market share and made its way into the mainstream market.<ref name="Business-Today">{{Cite news |last=Christine Chang |last2=Amy Cheng |last3=Susan Kim |last4=Johanna Kuhn Osius |last5=Jesus Reyes |last6=Daniel Turgel |year=2009 |title=Huawei Technologies: A Chinese Trail Blazer In Africa |work=Business Today |url=http://www.businesstoday.lk/article.php?article=931 |url-status=dead |access-date=24 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009035828/http://www.businesstoday.lk/article.php?article=931 |archive-date=9 October 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Huawei also won a key contract to build the first national telecommunications network for the People's Liberation Army, a deal one employee described as "small in terms of our overall business, but large in terms of our relationships".<ref name="FEAR">{{Cite journal |last=Gilley |first=Bruce |date=28 December 2000 |title=Huawei's Fixed Line to Beijing |journal=Far Eastern Economic Review |pages=94–98}}</ref> In 1994, founder Ren Zhengfei had a meeting with Party general secretary [[Jiang Zemin]], telling him that "switching equipment technology was related to national security, and that a nation that did not have its own switching equipment was like one that lacked its own military."

Another major turning point for the company came in 1996 when the government in Beijing adopted an explicit policy of supporting domestic telecommunications manufacturers and restricting access to foreign competitors. Huawei was promoted by both the government and the military as a [[National champions|national champion]], and established new research and development offices.<ref name=CSIS/>

Scholars have found that, after a few stages of historical morphing, employees do not own a part of Huawei through their “shares”. Instead, the “virtual stock is a contract right, not a property right; it gives the holder no voting power in either Huawei Tech or Huawei Holding, cannot be transferred, and is cancelled when the employee leaves the firm, subject to a redemption payment from Huawei Holding TUC at a low fixed price”.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 April 2019 |title=New research claims employees do not own Huawei |url=http://telecoms.com/496951/new-research-claims-employees-do-not-own-huawei/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417102744/http://telecoms.com/496951/new-research-claims-employees-do-not-own-huawei/ |archive-date=17 April 2019 |access-date=22 May 2019}}</ref><ref name="Clarke" /> The same scholars added, "given the public nature of trade unions in China, if the ownership stake of the trade union committee is genuine, and if the trade union and its committee function as trade unions generally function in China, then Huawei may be deemed effectively state-owned."<ref name="Clarke" />

==Controversies ==
{{Main|Criticism of Huawei}}

Huawei has faced criticism for various aspects of its operations, with its most prominent controversies having involved U.S. allegations of its products containing [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] for Chinese government espionage—consistent with domestic laws requiring Chinese citizens and companies to cooperate with state intelligence when warranted. Huawei executives have consistently denied these allegations, having stated that the company has never received any requests by the Chinese government to introduce backdoors in its equipment, would refuse to do so, and that Chinese law did not compel them to do so.<ref name="auto8">{{Cite web |last=Kharpal |first=Arjun |date=2019-03-05 |title=Huawei says it would never hand data to China's government.

=== Early business practices ===
Huawei employed a complex system of agreements with local state-owned telephone companies that seemed to include illicit payments to the local telecommunications bureau employees. During the late 1990s, the company created several joint ventures with their state-owned telecommunications company customers. By 1998, Huawei had signed agreements with municipal and provincial telephone bureaus to create Shanghai Huawei, Chengdu Huawei, Shenyang Huawei, Anhui Huawei, Sichuan Huawei, and other companies. The joint ventures were actually shell companies, and were a way to funnel money to local telecommunications employees so that Huawei could get deals to sell them equipment. In the case of Sichuan Huawei, for example, local partners could get 60–70 percent of their investment returned in the form of annual ‘dividends’.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Harwit |first=Eric |date=2007 |title=Building China's Telecommunications Network: Industrial Policy and the Role of Chinese State-Owned, Foreign and Private Domestic Enterprises |journal=[[The China Quarterly]] |issue=190 |pages=311–332 |issn=0305-7410 |jstor=20192772}}</ref>

Huawei has been at the center of [[United States espionage allegations over Chinese 5G network equipment|espionage allegations over Chinese 5G network equipment]]. In 2018, the United States passed a [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019|defense funding bill]] that contained a passage barring the federal government from doing business with

On 28 August 2020, French President [[Emmanuel Macron]] assured the Chinese government that it did not ban Huawei products from participating in its fifth-generation mobile roll-out, but favored European providers for security reasons.

=== Canadian response ===
On November 18, 2020, an opposition motion calling on the government for a decision on the participation of Huawei in Canada's 5G network and a plan on combating what it called "Chinese aggression" passed 179 to 146. The non-binding motion was supported by the [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] and [[Bloc Québécois]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Connolly |first=Amanda |date=2020-11-18 |title=Tory motion calling for action on Huawei, plan to combat Chinese aggression passes |work=[[Global News]] |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/7470672/conservative-motion-china-huawei/}}</ref>

==== Huawei's response and stockpiling ====
Before the September 15, 2020 deadline, Huawei was in "survival mode" and stockpiled "5G mobile processors, Wifi, radio frequency and display driver chips and other components" from key chip suppliers and manufacturers, including [[Samsung]], [[SK Hynix]], [[TSMC]], [[MediaTek]], [[Realtek]], [[Novatek]], and RichWave.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web |title=Huawei in 'survival mode' as suppliers race to beat US deadline |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Huawei-crackdown/Huawei-in-survival-mode-as-suppliers-race-to-beat-US-deadline |access-date=2020-10-31 |website=Nikkei Asia |language=en-GB}}</ref> Even in 2019, Huawei spent $23.45 billion on the stockpiling of chips and other supplies in 2019, up 73% from 2018.<ref name=":8" />

On its most crucial business, namely, its telecoms business (including 5G) and server business, Huawei has stockpiled 1.5 to 2 years' worth of chips and components.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web |title=Huawei builds up 2-year reserve of 'most important' US chips |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Huawei-crackdown/Huawei-builds-up-2-year-reserve-of-most-important-US-chips |access-date=2020-10-31 |website=Nikkei Asia |language=en-GB}}</ref> It began massively stockpiling from 2018, when [[Meng Wanzhou]], the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Canada upon U.S. request.<ref name=":9" /> Key Huawei suppliers included Xilinx, Intel, AMD, Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron and Kioxia.<ref name=":9" /> On the other hand, analysts predicted that Huawei could ship 195 million units of smartphones from its existing stockpile in 2021, but shipments may drop to 50 million in 2021 if rules are not relaxed.<ref name=":8" />

==== Replacement operating systems (Harmony OS)====

During the sanctions, it was noted that Huawei had been working on its own in-house operating system codenamed "[[HongMeng OS]]": in an interview with ''[[Die Welt]]'', executive Richard Yu stated that an in-house OS could be used as a "plan B" if it were prevented from using Android or Windows as the result of U.S. action.<ref>{{Cite web |date=14 March 2019 |title=Huawei confirms it has its own OS on back shelf as a plan B |url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3001685/huawei-confirms-it-has-built-its-own-operating-system-just-case-us |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521023511/https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3001685/huawei-confirms-it-has-built-its-own-operating-system-just-case-us |archive-date=21 May 2019 |access-date=21 May 2019 |website=South China Morning Post}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Faulkner |first=Cameron |date=14 March 2019 |title=Huawei developed its own operating systems in case it's banned from using Android and Windows |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265646/huawei-operating-systems-android-windows-ban |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525004428/https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265646/huawei-operating-systems-android-windows-ban |archive-date=25 May 2019 |access-date=23 May 2019 |website=The Verge}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kharpal |first=Arjun |date=15 March 2019 |title=Huawei built software for smartphones and laptops in case it can't use Microsoft or Google |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/huawei-has-built-its-own-operating-system-for-smartphones-laptops.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522193246/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/huawei-has-built-its-own-operating-system-for-smartphones-laptops.html |archive-date=22 May 2019 |access-date=23 May 2019 |website=CNBC}}</ref> Huawei filed trademarks for the names "Ark", "Ark OS", and "Harmony" in Europe, which were speculated to be connected to this OS.<ref>{{Cite web |last=phones |first=John McCann 2019-05-28T09:07:56Z Mobile |title=Huawei may be building an Ark (OS) as it prepares for life after Android |url=https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-may-be-building-an-ark-os-as-it-prepares-for-life-after-android |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529223849/https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-may-be-building-an-ark-os-as-it-prepares-for-life-after-android |archive-date=29 May 2019 |access-date=2019-05-29 |website=TechRadar |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Lakshmanan |first=Ravie |date=2019-07-15 |title=Huawei wants to name its Android OS replacement 'Harmony' in Europe |url=https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/07/15/huawei-wants-to-name-its-android-os-replacement-harmony-in-europe/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716221920/https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/07/15/huawei-wants-to-name-its-android-os-replacement-harmony-in-europe/ |archive-date=16 July 2019 |access-date=2019-07-16 |website=The Next Web |language=en-us}}</ref> On 9 August 2019, Huawei officially unveiled Harmony OS at its inaugural developers' conference in Dongguan with the ARK compiler which can be used to port Android [[Android application package|APK packages]] to the OS.<ref name="engadget.com" /><ref name="verge-harmony" />
