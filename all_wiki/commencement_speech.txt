A '''commencement speech''' or '''commencement address''' is a speech given to [[graduation|graduating]] students, generally at a [[university]], generally in the [[United States]], although the term is also used for [[secondary education]] institutions.

The "commencement" is a ceremony in which degrees or diplomas are conferred upon graduating students. A commencement speech is typically given by a notable figure in the community, during the ''commencement exercise''.  The person giving such a speech is known as a '''commencement speaker'''. Very commonly, colleges or universities will invite politicians, important citizens, or other noted speakers to come and address the graduating class.

A commencement speech is less bound by the structure found in other forms of public address, like eulogies or wedding speeches. The speaker accordingly enjoys a unique freedom to express him or herself. 

Dianne Pleuss, from Toastmasters International, emphasizes that the speech "should not be a lecture, but rather a personal, engaging story the audience can relate to”.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/henrydevries/2019/05/21/learn-how-to-give-great-speeches-from-commencement-speakers-like-robert-smith/|title=Learn How To Give Great Speeches From Commencement Speakers Like Robert Smith|last=DeVries|first=Henry|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref><blockquote>Toastmasters World Champion of Public Speaking, Ramona J. Smith, identifies six elements in a good commencement speech:<ref name=":0" />

* “''authenticity'' (being yourself)
* ''transparency'' (sharing a story of failure)
* ''wisdom'' (having failed, picked yourself back up, failed again, hit reset, and used the lessons learned from the previous failures to become successful)
* ''humor'' (comic relief, keep their attention, make that connection)
* ''credibility'' (Are you somebody?)
* ''preparation'' (practicing the speech or hiring an exceptional speech writer)"
</blockquote>Despite meaning "beginning", ''commencement'' may be mistaken to mean "ending" due to its association with the end of college. Its usage originated with students finishing their studies and being awarded a degree, thus commencing as bachelors or masters in a subject and enjoying new privileges within academia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/commencement|title=commencement (n.)|last=Online etymology dictionary|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>
