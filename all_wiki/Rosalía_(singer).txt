==Artistry==
===Musical style and genres===
After Rosalía's increase in popularity with the release of "[[Malamente]]" in spring 2018, her music was described{{By whom|date=December 2020}} as a "very interesting [[New flamenco|fusion of flamenco with modern arts]]". American magazine [[Pitchfork Media|''Pitchfork'']] called the singer's voice "a soft liquid velvet" and wrote about the song that "Malamente consumes the listener with drums and soft synthesizers that drag you to their world completely". After releasing ''El Mal Querer'' in November 2018, ''[[The Guardian]]'' scored it with 5/5 stars and said: "the Catalan singer's potent, smart second album is more complex than any Latin pop currently in the charts".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/01/rosalia-el-mal-querer-review-flamenco-pop-star-is-a-formidable-new-talent|title=Rosalía: El Mal Querer review – flamenco-pop star is a formidable new talent|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=2018-11-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Before that, shortly after releasing her first studio album, ''[[Los ángeles (album)|Los Ángeles]]'', writing for MondoSonoro, Yeray S. Iborra felt that Rosalía "is posited as the contemporary [[cantaor]]a who has better understood the current times". After Rosalía released her 2019 track "[[Con altura]]", Rosalía's music evolved to a more urban/reggeaton sound. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' had this to say about the song: "it's a modern take in reference to Spanish flamenco songs inspired by Afro-Caribbean sounds; ever the champion of cross-cultural experimentation, Rosalía has ultimately described it as her personal homage to classic reggaeton." Since this release, Rosalía's music is much more pop and radio-friendly than her 2018 releases. Some examples of it are the funny track "[[Milionària]]" and the romantic "[[Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

She is often accused of cultural appropriation by the Andalusian and the [[Romani people in Spain|Romani people]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Beatley |first=Meaghan |date=14 November 2018 |title=Grammy nominee Rosalía's flamenco fame is questioned by Spain's Roma community |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-11-14/award-winning-rosal-flamenco-fame-questioned-spains-roma-community |url-status=live |work=[[GlobalPost]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331014925/https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-11-14/award-winning-rosal-flamenco-fame-questioned-spains-roma-community |archive-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>

Rosalía has cited [[Camarón de la Isla]], [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]] and [[La Niña de los Peines]] as her major musical influences. In January 2019 she told [[MTV]] "when I was 13 years old I started listening to him [Camarón de la Isla] by chance. These genre, flamenco, was what my high-school friends listened to and so did I. When I discovered him I was like "oh my God!" I didn't think anyone was capable to sing with such a voice; it would go right through me so heartily. He was my introduction to flamenco. Thanks to him I discovered this vast universe within this music style which is almost endless and very exciting." When she was asked about the impact Blake had on her, she said: "I started listening to him when I was at university. His music has left a mark on me; not only the bold character of his production but also its minimalism and free structures. When I listen to him, I can feel that he allows himself a lot of freedom. I personally think that he doesn't do music to please nobody but only for himself." Rosalía collaborated with Blake on his song "[[Barefoot in the Park (song)|Barefoot in the Park]]" which was released as the fourth single of his 2019 album ''[[Assume Form]]'' in April 2019. Rosalía states that she began listening to another big influence in her life, [[La Niña de los Peines]], when she was 16. She states that at first she didn't enjoy her music because it sounded like [[78-rpm|78 RPM]] records to her but that later on she ended up appreciating her melodies and realized that she was a creator, that she was a [[cantaora]] when, at that time, most of the flamenco singers were men. She said: "flamenco is a masculine art form by tradition and there she was, with all her creativity as a woman. She became a professional at the time when it was very unusual".<ref>{{Citation|title=Inspired With Rosalía (MTV Push) {{!}} MTV Music|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA8xZn8XmA|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref>

When she was asked about her biggest fashion influence, she cited [[Lola Flores]]. In an interview with ''Billboard'' she said: "I love her. I love the attitude and the strength she had".

== Impact ==
Music in Spain in the 20th century was a huge art. The popularitzation and growing international recognition of Spanish musical legends such as [[Julio Iglesias]] and his son [[Enrique Iglesias|Enrique]], [[Camarón de la Isla]], [[Joan Manuel Serrat]], [[Joaquín Sabina]], [[Alejandro Sanz]], [[Miguel Bosé]], [[Rocío Jurado]] or [[Isabel Pantoja]] was very notable and pleasing at the time, making the country reach a satisfying peak of musical projection. The effects of musical [[globalization]] in Spain became notable after the meteoric success of Italian singer [[Laura Pausini]] in the country, whose [[Laura Pausini (1994 album)|self-titled 1994 studio album]] still holds the national record for the best selling album by a foreign artist.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-31|title=Laura Pausini celebrará los 25 años de carrera con un álbum especial y diciendo "gracias España"|url=https://www.cadena100.es/musica/noticias/laura-pausini-celebrara-los-anos-carrera-con-album-especial-diciendo-gracias-espana-20191031_540160|access-date=2020-08-01|website=CADENA 100|language=es}}</ref>  In the mid-2000s a few artists like [[David Bisbal]], [[Estopa]] and [[Malú]] caught the attention of the international public. In that period of time "[[The Ketchup Song (Aserejé)|Aserejé]]" by  pop band [[Las Ketchup]] became the biggest Spanish song in the world since [[Los del Río|Los del Rio]]'s 1993 track "[[Macarena]]". Despite its huge projection, Spain's interest in the music industry began to decrease progressively, affecting a huge amount of potential artists. After the [[2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis|Spanish financial crisis]] began in 2008, the [[music industry]] received zero interest by the population since there was nothing fresh to bet on or to finance. Art in Spain became truly despised and wasted, expanding the thought that studying and/or performing arts is useless. Rosalía, however, stated that she wanted to study musical arts since she was a teenager, something very rare at the time.

Rosalía is the main character in the first tidal wave of Spanish international musicians of the 21st century. Her rise to fame came just when it was needed. Approximately in 2014 new interesting artists started to emerge in Spain from [[Álvaro Soler]] to [[Pablo Alborán]]. Spain, however, being a Spanish-language country that is able to get inspired by a lot of different projects and genres thanks to technology and communications, had a lot of pop stars but not that many urban/hip hop-orientated artists. Spain's music industry was very weak, monotonous and boring. Thus, based on this premise, and with the help of streaming platforms artists like Yung Beef, [[C. Tangana]], [[La Zowi]] or [[Bad Gyal]] started to make fresh urban music influenced by the folklore of regions like [[Puerto Rico]], [[Jamaica]] or [[Colombia]]. The rise of urban music in Spain grew in parallel with the increasing global interest in [[reggaeton]], [[Trap music|trap]] and, in general, [[Music of Latin America|Latin American music]]. Rosalía became very close with these artists, who became very close influences for her.<ref>{{Cite web|last=RTVE|first=Playz|date=November 4, 2019|title=El trabajo; con Rosalía, Yung Beef, Trapani y Alba Rupérez {{!}} 1x04 {{!}} Mixtape|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWr2VxJIT68&t=556s|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 3, 2020|website=YouTube}}</ref> The interest in music in Spain, however, didn't reach its peak until 2017 when the mentioned artists reached a high point of success and when talent show ''[[Operación Triunfo (Spanish TV series)|Operación Triunfo]]'' aired on television for the first time since 2011. The TV show attracted millions of loyal viewers and became a massive platform for the great artists that participated on the show like [[Aitana (singer)|Aitana]], [[Amaia (singer)|Amaia]] or [[Lola Índigo|Lola Indigo]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aitana y Rosalía, artistas revelación de 2018 en España|url=https://www.promusicae.es/news/view/304-aitana-y-rosalia-artistas-revelacion-de-2018-en-espana|access-date=2020-08-01|website=Promusicae - Productores de Música de España|language=en}}</ref> When Rosalia appeared on the charts for the first time with "[[Malamente]]", she became this highly interesting fresh artist that had invented something new and exiting to listen to, a mix of traditional and modern arts; Rosalía had created flamenco music for everybody.<ref>{{Cite news|last=null|date=2018-11-14|title=Rosalía: flamenco para una nueva generación|language=es-LA|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/es/2018/11/14/espanol/cultura/rosalia-mal-querer-flamenco.html|access-date=2020-08-01|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The revenue of music in Spain was of 232 million euros in 2018, a 9% more than the year before.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Music Sales in Spain in 2017 rise almost 9%, above the World avarage, reaching 232 Million Euros|url=https://www.promusicae.es/news/view/289-music-sales-in-spain-in-2017-rise-almost-9-above-the-world-avarage-reaching-232-million-euros|access-date=2020-08-01|website=Promusicae - Productores de Música de España|language=en}}</ref> Due to this facts, [[Music of Spain|music in Spain]] became an art to protect and to be proud of, making people take a look at the Spanish artistic market, which had abandoned its category of C-list industry.<ref>{{Cite web|title=soundmate's Review of 'EL MAL QUERER' by ROSALÍA|url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/soundmate/album/121472-el-mal-querer/|access-date=2020-08-01|website=Album of The Year|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2020, Spanish novel rapper Don Patricio told ''[[El Periódico de Catalunya|El Periódico]]'' that "The interest that the world has in Rosalía has benefited all of us, because all those who are interested in her and her music have looked out to see what else we are producing here.

The popularization of [[new flamenco]] nationally and worldwide has opened the doors for new artists such as María José Llergo to reach a wider interest in other parts of the world. Before Rosalía rose to fame, it's hard to remember interest in this way of expression by the young; it has been since her critical and general acclaim that it has caught the interest of a large number of Spanish and non-Spanish. This has also opened the door for the discussion of [[cultural appropriation]]. Rosalía has often been accused of stealing the culture of the Spanish Romani people'','' who claim that this artistic expression as one of their own since it has been one of the few ways of expression that have made the [[Gitanos]] forget the discrimination and persecution this ethnic group has suffered since forever.<ref>{{Cite web|last=País|first=El|date=November 12, 2018|title=Lo que piensan los gitanos de ROSALÍA: Ofensa, burla o renovación|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnamovzq1UE|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=August 1, 2020|website=YouTube}}</ref> Some people reaffirm that, as a [[Catalonia|Catalan]], she shouldn't perform flamenco since she isn't Gitana nor [[Andalusians|Andalusian]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Acusan a Rosalía de apropiación cultural, ¿y qué?|url=https://www.elplural.com/playtime/musica/acusan-a-rosalia-de-apropiacion-cultural-y-que_129787102|access-date=2020-08-01|website=El Plural|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-07-16|title=Rosalía es una Racista.|url=https://rebelionfeminista.org/2019/07/16/rosalia-es-una-racista/|access-date=2020-08-01|website=Rebelión Feminista|language=es-ES}}</ref> On the other hand, many others defend Rosalía saying that, in a global interconnected world where we can access a huge amount of information in just a few seconds and be inspired by what we read, listen or see, stating that Rosalía is just a victim of inspiration comparing the situation with Madonna's high interest in Spanish traditions, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Clan|first=Music Radar|date=August 26, 2018|title=ROSALIA.

=== Relationships ===
In 2016, Rosalía started dating Spanish rapper [[C. Tangana]]. They co-wrote eight out of the eleven songs of Rosalía's sophomore album ''[[El mal querer|El Mal Querer]]'' and [[Antes de morirme|collaborated vocally]] twice. They broke up after two years of dating, most concretely, in May 2018. Since that moment, the couple has been referencing each other in songs, social media posts, interviews and music videos. In April 2020, Tangana told the press that there "exists a good friendship between the two".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Palmero|first=María|date=2020-05-23|title=Rosalía y C.

===Political views===
Rosalía identifies as a [[Feminism|feminist]]. After being congratulated at the 2019 Billboard Women in Music gala, the singer stated: "I was fifteen when I entered a recording studio for the first time having all this women as references.
