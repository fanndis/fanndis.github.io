'''Dance-pop''' is a popular music subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally uptempo music intended for [[nightclub]]s with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for [[contemporary hit radio]]. Developing from a combination of [[Dance music|dance]] and [[Pop music|pop]] with influences of [[disco]],<ref name=AMDancePop/> [[post-disco]]<ref name="post">Smay, David & Cooper, Kim (2001).

Dance-pop is known for being highly eclectic, having borrowed influences from other genres, which varied by producers, artists and periods. Such include [[contemporary R&B]], [[House music|house]], [[Trance music|trance]], [[techno]], [[electropop]], [[new jack swing]], [[funk]] and [[pop rock]].

Dance-pop is a popular mainstream style of music and there have been numerous artists and groups who perform in the genre. Notable artists include [[Cher]], [[Madonna]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Spice Girls]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[NSYNC]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[JoJo Siwa]], [[Rihanna]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Ariana Grande]].

==History==
===1980s===
As the term "disco" started to go out of fashion by the late 1970s to early 1980s, other terms were commonly used to describe disco-based music, such as "post-disco", "club", "dance" or "dance-pop" music.<ref name=AMDancePop/> These genres were, in essence, a more modern variant of disco music known as [[post-disco]], which tended to be more experimental, [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[Music producer|producer]]/[[DJ]]-driven, often using [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.

Dance-pop music emerged in the 1980s as a combination of dance and pop, or post-disco, which was uptempo and simple, club-natured, producer-driven and catchy. Dance-pop was more uptempo and dancey than regular pop, yet more structured and less free-form than dance music, usually combining pop's easy structure and catchy tunes with dance's strong beat and uptempo nature. Dance-pop music was usually created, composed and produced by record producers who would then hire singers to perform the songs.

In the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop. According to prominent [[Allmusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], [[Madonna]] had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music, utilizing her charisma, chutzpah and sex appeal. Erlewine claimed that Madonna "launched dance-pop" and set the standard for the genre for the next two decades.<ref>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. Madonna (Madonna album) at AllMusic. Retrieved September 4, 2009.</ref> As the primary songwriter on her self-titled debut album and a co-producer by her third record, Madonna's insistence on being involved in all creative aspects of her work was highly unusual for a female dance-pop vocalist at the time. The staff of ''Vice'' magazine stated that her debut album "drew the blueprint for future dance-pop."<ref>"The 99 Greatest Dance Albums of All Time". Vice. July 14, 2015. Retrieved May 19, 2016.</ref>

In the 1980s, dance-pop was closely aligned to other uptempo electronic genres, such as [[Hi-NRG]]. Prominent producers in the 1980s included [[Stock, Aitken and Waterman]], who created Hi-NRG/dance-pop for artists such as [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]] and [[Bananarama]]. During the decade, dance-pop borrowed influences from [[funk]] (e.g. [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Whitney Houston]]), [[new jack swing]] (e.g. [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Paula Abdul]]), and [[contemporary R&B]].

Other prominent dance-pop artists and groups of the 1980s included the [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Mel and Kim]], [[Samantha Fox]], [[Debbie Gibson]], and [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]].

===1990s===
By the 1990s, dance-pop had become a major genre in popular music. Several dance-pop groups and artists emerged during the 1990s, such as the [[Spice Girls]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Backstreet Boys]], and [['NSYNC]]. During the early 1990s, dance-pop borrowed influences from [[house music]] (e.g. [[Right Said Fred]]'s "[[I'm Too Sexy]]", [[Taylor Dayne]]'s ''[[Soul Dancing]]'', and [[Madonna]]'s "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]", "[[Rescue Me (Madonna song)|Rescue Me]]" and "[[Deeper and Deeper]]"), as well as [[contemporary R&B]] and [[new jack swing]] (e.g. [[Shanice]]'s "[[I Love Your Smile]]").

By the late 1990s, [[electronic music|electronic]] influences became evident in dance-pop music; Madonna's critically acclaimed and commercially successful album ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998) incorporated [[techno]], [[trance music|trance]] and other forms of electronic dance music, bringing [[electronica]] into mainstream dance-pop. Additionally, also in 1998, [[Cher]] released a dance-pop song called "[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]" which made usage of a technological innovation of the time, [[Auto-Tune]]. An [[audio processor]] and a form of pitch modification software, Auto-Tune is commonly used as a way to correct pitch and to create special effects. Since the late 1990s, the use of Auto-Tune processing has become a common feature of dance-pop music.

[[Celine Dion]] also released a midtempo dance-pop song, "[[That's the Way It Is (Celine Dion song)|That's the Way It Is]]" by the end of 1999. Also during this period, some British bands connected with [[Britpop]] and [[alternative pop]] experimented with dance pop as a form - examples include [[Catatonia]] single [[Karaoke Queen]], [[Kenickie]]'s final single [[Stay in the Sun]] and [[Romo]] band [[Orlando (band)|Orlando]]'s major label debut single "Just For A Second." Another Britpop band, [[Theaudience]] was fronted by [[Sophie Ellis Bextor]] who went on to a successful solo career primarily in artist-driven dance-pop.

===2000s===

At the beginning of the 2000s, dance-pop music was still prominent, and highly electronic in style, influenced by genres such as trance, house, techno and [[electro (music)|electro]]. Nonetheless, as R&B and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] became extremely popular from the early part of the decade onwards, dance-pop was often influenced by [[urban contemporary|urban]] music. Dance-pop stars from the 1980s and 1990s such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Madonna, Janet Jackson and Kylie Minogue continued to achieve success at the beginning of the decade. Whilst much dance-pop at the time was R&B-influenced, many records started to return to their [[disco]] roots; Kylie Minogue's albums such as ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'' (2000) and ''[[Fever (Kylie Minogue album)|Fever]]'' (2001) contained influences of disco music, or a new 21st-century version of the genre known as [[nu-disco]]; hit singles such as "[[Spinning Around]]" (2000) and "[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]" (2001) also contained disco traces.<ref name=AMDancePop/> In Madonna's case, her album ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]'' (2000) contained elements of [[Euro disco]], especially the successful [[Music (Madonna song)|eponymous lead single]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-songs-of-the-aughts-20110617/madonna-music-19691231 |title=100 Best Songs of the 2000s: Madonna, 'Music' |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>

Nevertheless, it was not until the mid-to-latter part of the decade when dance-pop music returned greatly to its disco roots; this can be seen with Madonna's album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005), which borrowed strong influences from the genre, especially from 1970s artists and bands such as [[ABBA]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Donna Summer]]. Britney Spears' album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007) contained influences of Euro disco.
[[File:Britney Spears.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Britney Spears]] is among the main faces of 2000s and 2010s dance-pop music.]]
The mid-to-late 2000s saw the arrival of several new dance-pop artists, including [[Rihanna]], [[Kesha]], [[Katy Perry]] and [[Lady Gaga]]. This period in time also saw dance-pop's return to its more electronic roots aside from its disco ones, with strong influences of synthpop and [[electropop]]. Lady Gaga is frequently considered as one of the pioneers of this evolution, notably with her singles "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" and "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" which were heavily influenced by synthpop and electropop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/buy-the-hype-why-electronic-dance-music-really-could-be-the-new-rock/259597/|title=Buy the Hype: Why Electronic Dance Music Really Could Be the New Rock|last=Bogart|first=Jonathan|date=2012-07-10|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> Rihanna's singles in the dance-pop genre, including "[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]" and "[[Disturbia (song)|Disturbia]]", contained electronic influences, the former of which has elements of house music,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/rihannadontstop.htm |first=Bill |last=Lamb |title=Rihanna - Don't Stop the Music |website=Top 40 / Pop |accessdate=2014-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303223904/http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/rihannadontstop.htm |archivedate=2012-03-03 }}</ref> the latter electropop. Kesha's debut single, "[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]", was also highly electronic in style and employed a [[video game music|video game]] beat. Katy Perry's "[[Hot N Cold (song)|Hot N Cold]]" (2008), "[[California Gurls (song)|California Gurls]]" (2010), and "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]" (2010), which were major commercial hits, also showcased influences of electropop and house music.

===2010s===
The 2010s, similarly to the late 2000s, saw strong electronic influences present within dance-pop and also strong emphasis on bass-heavy drum beats. Artists such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Madonna]], [[Kesha]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Usher (singer)|Usher]] and [[Rihanna]] remained very popular, while newer recording artists such as [[Ariana Grande]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Rita Ora]], and [[Dua Lipa]] joined the dance-pop charts within the decade.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2019/dance-club-songs</ref>

American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]'s albums ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012), ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017) contain more of a pop-influenced sound, which features production by dance-pop record producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. [[Ariana Grande]]'s single "[[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]]" featuring [[Iggy Azalea]] was a big hit in 2014 and reached combined sales and track-equivalent streams of 9 million units worldwide the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|website=www.ifpi.org|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>
