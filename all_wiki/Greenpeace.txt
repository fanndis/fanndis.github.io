==History==

===Origins===
[[File:AmchitkaAlaskaLoc.png|right|thumb|Location of Amchitka island in Alaska.]]In the late 1960s, the U.S. had planned its ''[[Cannikin]]'' underground nuclear weapon test in the tectonically unstable island of [[Amchitka]] in Alaska; the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a [[tsunami]]. A 1969 demonstration of 7,000<ref name="1969 news">"Protests fail to stop Nuclear Test countdown", ''The Free-Lance Star'' - 2 Oct 1969, Accessed via Google News Archive 16 November 2012.</ref> people blocked the [[Peace Arch Border Crossing]] between British Columbia and Washington,<ref>Congressional Record, 1971, p. 18072</ref> carrying signs reading "Don't Make A Wave. It's Your Fault If Our Fault Goes".<ref name=Brown-May>''Michael Brown & John May: The Greenpeace Story'', {{ISBN|0-86318-691-2}}</ref> The protests did not stop the U.S. from detonating the bomb.<ref name=Brown-May/>

While no earthquake or tsunami followed the test, the opposition grew when the U.S. announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one. Among the opponents were [[Jim Bohlen]], a veteran who had served in the U.S. Navy, and [[Irving Stowe]] and [[Dorothy Stowe]], who had recently become [[Quaker]]s. They were frustrated by the lack of action by the [[Sierra Club Canada]], of which they were members.<ref name=Brown-May/> From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of [[Nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]], "bearing witness", where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence.<ref name=Brown-May/> Jim Bohlen's wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of [[Albert Bigelow]] in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club.<ref name=Brown-May/> The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 The [[Don't Make a Wave Committee]] was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of [[Robert Hunter (journalist)|Robert Hunter]] and his wife Bobbi Hunter. Subsequently, the Stowe home at 2775 Courtenay Street ([[Vancouver]]) became the headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hawthorn |first=Tom |url=http://tomhawthorn.blogspot.com/2011/03/for-sale-house-where-greenpeace-was.html |title=Tom Hawthorn's blog: For sale: The house where Greenpeace was born |publisher=Tomhawthorn.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-30 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref> As [[Rex Weyler]] put it in his chronology, ''Greenpeace'', in 1969, Irving and Dorothy Stowe's "quiet home on Courtenay Street would soon become a hub of monumental, global significance". Some of the first Greenpeace meetings were held there. The first office was opened in a backroom, storefront on Cypress and West Broadway SE corner in Kitsilano, Vancouver.<ref>''Greenpeace to Amchitka, An Environmental Odyssey'' by Robert Hunter.</ref> Within half a year Greenpeace moved in to share the upstairs office space with The Society Promoting Environmental Conservation at 4th and Maple in [[Kitsilano]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spec.bc.ca/|title=SPEC Official website}}</ref>

[[Irving Stowe]] arranged a [[benefit concert]] (supported by [[Joan Baez]]) that took place on 16 October 1970 at the [[Pacific Coliseum]] in Vancouver.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dyck |first=Lloyd H. Dyck |date=17 October 1970 |title=Joni nervous at Greenpeace benefit show |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29732546/joni_nervous_at_greenpeace_benefit/ |newspaper=[[Vancouver Sun]] |publisher=The Sun Publishing Company |location=[[Vancouver]] BC |volume=84 |issue=242 |page=35 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> The concert created the financial basis for the first Greenpeace campaign.<ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/11/22/a-long-lost-1970-benefit-concert-featuring-joni-mitchell-and-james-taylor-surfaces/ Lost 1970 Amchitka Concert Featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor Surfaces] ''The Wall Street Journal'', 22 November 2009</ref> [[Amchitka (album)|Amchitka, the 1970 concert that launched Greenpeace]] was published by Greenpeace in November 2009 on CD and is also available as an mp3 download via the Amchitka concert website. Using the money raised with the concert, the Don't Make a Wave Committee chartered a ship, the ''[[Phyllis Cormack]]'' owned and sailed by John Cormack. The ship was renamed ''Greenpeace'' for the protest after a term coined by activist Bill Darnell.<ref name=Brown-May/>

On September 15th 1971, the ship sailed towards Amchitka and faced the U.S. Coast Guard ship ''[[USCGC Confidence (WMEC-619)|Confidence]]''<ref name=Brown-May/> which forced the activists to turn back. Because of this and the increasingly bad weather the crew decided to return to Canada only to find out that the news about their journey and reported support from the crew of the ''Confidence'' had generated sympathy for their protest.<ref name="Brown-May"/> After this Greenpeace tried to navigate to the test site with other vessels, until the U.S. detonated the bomb.<ref name=Brown-May/> The nuclear test was criticized and the U.S. decided not to continue with their test plans at Amchitka.

====Founders and founding time of Greenpeace====
Environmental historian Frank Zelko dates the formation of the "[[Don't Make a Wave Committee]]" to 1969 and, according to Jim Bohlen, the group adopted the name "Don't Make a Wave Committee" on 28 November 1969.<ref name="zelko2">{{cite web|url=http://prophet.library.ubc.ca/ojs/index.php/bcstudies/article/download/1725/1770 |title=Frank Zelko: Making Greenpeace: The Development of Direct Action Environmentalism in British Columbia(PDF) |accessdate=2012-11-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412233853/http://prophet.library.ubc.ca/ojs/index.php/bcstudies/article/download/1725/1770 |archive-date=12 April 2013}}</ref> According to the Greenpeace web site, The Don't Make a Wave Committee was established in 1970.<ref name="Greenpeace: founders"/> Certificate of incorporation of The Don't Make a Wave Committee dates the incorporation to the fifth of October, 1970.<ref name="Moore: founders"/> Researcher Vanessa Timmer dates the official incorporation to 1971.<ref name="Timmer"/> Greenpeace itself calls the protest voyage of 1971 as "the beginning".<ref name="The History of Greenpeace">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/about/history/amchitka-hunter/ |title=Greenpeace International: The History of Greenpeace |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref> According to [[Patrick Moore (consultant)|Patrick Moore]], who was an early member and has since distanced himself from Greenpeace, and Rex Weyler, the name of "The Don't Make a Wave Committee" was officially changed to Greenpeace Foundation in 1972.<ref name="Moore: founders"/><ref name="Weyler:chronology">{{cite web|first=Rex|last=Weyler |url=http://rexweyler.com/greenpeace/greenpeace-history/chronology/ |title=Chronology, the Founding of Greenpeace |publisher=rexweyler.com |accessdate=2012-11-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017215151/http://rexweyler.com/greenpeace/greenpeace-history/chronology/ |archive-date=17 October 2013}}</ref>

Vanessa Timmer has referred to the early members as "an unlikely group of loosely organized protestors".<ref name="Timmer"/> Frank Zelko has commented that "unlike [[Friends of the Earth]], for example, which sprung fully formed from the forehead of [[David Brower]], Greenpeace developed in a more evolutionary manner. There was no single founder".<ref name="zelko">{{cite web |first=Rex|last=Weyler |url=http://www.utne.com/archives/WavesofCompassion.aspx?page=19 |title=Waves of Compassion.

The current Greenpeace web site lists the founders of The Don't Make a Wave Committee as Dorothy and Irving Stowe, Marie and Jim Bohlen, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, and Robert Hunter.<ref name="Greenpeace: founders"/> According to both Patrick Moore and an interview with Dorothy Stowe, Dorothy Metcalfe, Jim Bohlen and Robert Hunter, the founders of The Don't Make a Wave Committee were Paul Cote, Irving and Dorothy Stowe and Jim and Marie Bohlen.<ref name="Moore: founders"/><ref name="Archive.greenpeace.org">{{cite web|url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/vrml/rw/text/def/founders.html |title=Interview by Michael Friedrich: Greenpeace Founders |publisher=Archive.greenpeace.org |accessdate=2011-02-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622032226/http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/vrml/rw/text/def/founders.html |archive-date=22 June 2011}}</ref>

Because Patrick Moore was among the crew of the first protest voyage, Moore also considers himself one of the founders.

===After Amchitka===
After the office in the Stowe home, (and after the first concert fund-raiser) Greenpeace functions moved to other private homes and held public meetings weekly on Wednesday nights at the Kitsilano Neighborhood House before settling, in the autumn of 1974, in a small office shared with the SPEC environmental group at 2007 West 4th at Maple in [[Kitsilano]]. When the nuclear tests at Amchitka were over, Greenpeace moved its focus to the French atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing]] at the [[Moruroa|Moruroa Atoll]] in [[French Polynesia]]. The young organization needed help for their protests and were contacted by [[David McTaggart]], a former businessman living in New Zealand. In 1972 the yacht ''Vega'', a {{convert|12.5|m|ft|adj=on}} ketch owned by [[David McTaggart]], was renamed ''Greenpeace III'' and sailed in an anti-nuclear protest into the exclusion zone at Moruroa to attempt to disrupt French nuclear testing. This voyage was sponsored and organized by the New Zealand branch of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].<ref>Making Waves the Greenpeace New Zealand Story by Michael Szabo ISBN</ref> The [[French Navy]] tried to stop the protest in several ways, including assaulting David McTaggart. McTaggart was supposedly beaten to the point that he lost sight in one of his eyes. However, one of McTaggart's crew members photographed the incident and went public. After the assault was publicized, France announced it would stop the atmospheric nuclear tests.<ref name=Brown-May/>

In the mid-1970s some Greenpeace members started an independent campaign, Project Ahab, against commercial [[whaling]], since Irving Stowe was against Greenpeace focusing on other issues than nuclear weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XC_AAAAQBAJ&q=ahab&pg=PT936|title=International Human Rights: A Comprehensive Introduction|last=Haas|first=Michael|date=2013-09-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135005788|language=en}}</ref> After Irving Stowe died in 1975, the ''Phyllis Cormack'' sailed from Vancouver to face Soviet whalers on the coast of California. Greenpeace activists disrupted the whaling by placing themselves between the harpoons and the whales, and footage of the protests spread across the world. Later in the 1970s, the organization widened its focus to include [[toxic waste]] and commercial [[seal hunting]].<ref name=Brown-May/>

The "Greenpeace [[Declaration of Interdependence]]" was published by Greenpeace in the ''Greenpeace Chronicles'' (Winter 1976-77). This declaration was a condensation of a number of ecological manifestos [[Robert Hunter (journalist)|Bob Hunter]] had written over the years.

===Organizational development===

Greenpeace evolved from a group of Canadian and American protesters into a less conservative group of environmentalists who were more reflective of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and [[hippie]] youth movements of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rexweyler.com/greenpeace/ |title=Greenpeace |publisher=Rex Weyler |date=1954-03-01 |accessdate=2011-06-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612061135/http://rexweyler.com/greenpeace/ |archive-date=12 June 2011}}</ref> The social and cultural background from which Greenpeace emerged heralded a period of de-conditioning away from Old World antecedents and sought to develop new codes of social, environmental and political behavior.<ref name="odysseu">Robert Hunter: Greenpeace to Amchitka, An Environmental Odyssey</ref><ref>[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/may2005/2005-05-02-05.asp Greenpeace Founder Bob Hunter Dies in Toronto]. ens-newswire.com (2005-05-02)</ref>

In the mid-1970s independent groups using the name Greenpeace started springing up worldwide. By 1977, there were 15 to 20 Greenpeace groups around the world.<ref name=Weyler/> At the same time the Canadian Greenpeace office was heavily in debt. Disputes between offices over fund-raising and organizational direction split the global movement as the North American offices were reluctant to be under the authority of the Canada office.<ref name=Weyler>{{cite web|author=Weyler, Rex |url=http://www.utne.com/web_special/web_specials_archives/articles/2246-4.html |title=Waves of Compassion.

After the incidents of Moruroa Atoll, David McTaggart had moved to France to battle in court with the French state and helped to develop the cooperation of European Greenpeace groups.<ref name=Brown-May/> [[David McTaggart]] lobbied the Canadian Greenpeace Foundation to accept a new structure bringing the scattered Greenpeace offices under the auspices of a single global organization. The European Greenpeace paid the debt of the Canadian Greenpeace office and on 14 October 1979, '''Greenpeace International''' came into existence.<ref name="Timmer">{{cite web|url=http://ires.xplorex.com/sites/ires/files/about/publications/documents/VanessaTimmerPhDThesis.pdf |title=Timmer, Vanessa: Agility and Resilence: The Adaptive Capacity of Friends of the Earth International and Greenpeace |publisher=University of British Columbia|date= February 2007 |accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref><ref name=Weyler/> Under the new structure, the local offices contributed a percentage of their income to the international organization, which took responsibility for setting the overall direction of the movement with each regional office having one vote.<ref name=Weyler/> Some Greenpeace groups, namely [[London Greenpeace]] (dissolved in 2001) and the US-based [[Greenpeace Foundation]] (still operational) however decided to remain independent from Greenpeace International.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/people/biogs/london_grnpeace.html |title=London Greenpeace – A History of Peace, Protest and Campaigning |publisher=[[McSpotlight]] |accessdate=2011-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703213432/http://www.mcspotlight.org/people/biogs/london_grnpeace.html |archive-date=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeacefoundation.org/about/gpMovement.cfm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120801065206/http://www.greenpeacefoundation.org/about/gpMovement.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-01 |title=About the |publisher=Greenpeace Foundation |accessdate=2011-02-21 }}</ref>

==Organizational structure==

===Governance===
[[File:GPIgovernance&management.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The governance and management structure of Greenpeace.]]
Greenpeace consists of ''Greenpeace International'' (officially Stichting Greenpeace Council) based in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], and 26 regional offices operating in 55 countries.<ref name="organization">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured |title=Greenpeace, organization |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2016-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117224158/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/ |archive-date=17 January 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The regional offices work largely autonomously under the supervision of Greenpeace International.

Each regional office is led by a regional executive director elected by the regional board of directors. The regional boards also appoint a trustee to The Greenpeace International Annual General Meeting, where the trustees elect or remove the board of directors of Greenpeace International. The role of the annual general meeting is also to discuss and decide the overall principles and strategically important issues for Greenpeace in collaboration with the trustees of regional offices and Greenpeace International board of directors.<ref name="governance">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/governance-structure |title=Governance Structure |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2012-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206184126/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/governance-structure/ |archive-date=6 December 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Funding===
Greenpeace receives its funding from individual supporters and foundations.<ref name="GPI-FAQ"/><ref name="HBS"/> Greenpeace screens all major donations in order to ensure it does not receive unwanted donations.<ref name="funding">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/belgium/nl/press/reports/fundraisingpolicies.pdf |title=Greenpeace Fundraising policies|accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref> The organization does not accept money from governments, intergovernmental organizations, political parties or corporations in order to avoid their influence.<ref name="GPI-FAQ"/><ref name="HBS"/><ref name="funding"/> However, Greenpeace does receive money from the National Postcode Lottery, the biggest government-sponsored lottery in the Netherlands.

Donations from foundations which are funded by political parties or receive most of their funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations are rejected. Foundation donations are also rejected if the foundations attach unreasonable conditions, restrictions or constraints on Greenpeace activities or if the donation would compromise the independence and aims of Greenpeace.<ref name="funding"/> Since in the mid-1990s the number of supporters started to decrease, Greenpeace pioneered the use of [[Street fundraiser|face-to-face fundraising]] where fundraisers actively seek new supporters at public places, subscribing them for a monthly direct debit donation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080605013106/http://www.sofii.org/active%20site/Members%20area/FF171GPIF2F.html Greenpeace International – the reinvention of face-to-face fundraising]. sofii.org</ref><ref>Burnett, Ken (2002) ''Relationship Fundraising: A Donor-based Approach to the Business of Raising Money'', The White Lion Press Limited</ref> In 2008, most of the €202.5 million received by the organization was donated by about 2.6 million regular supporters, mainly from Europe.<ref name="Annual report 2008"/> In 2014, the annual revenue of Greenpeace was reported to be about €300 million (US$400 million) although they lost about €4 million (US$5 million) in currency speculation that year.<ref>(16 June 2014) [https://apnews.com/63436c5bb9f7456080300e19744d4ead Greenpeace loses $5.2M on rogue employee trading] Associated Press, Retrieved 17 December 2014</ref> [[File:DDC-GP.JPG|thumb|Greenpeace street fundraiser talking to a passer-by.]]

In September 2003, [[Public Interest Watch]] (PIW) complained to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] that Greenpeace USA tax returns were inaccurate and in violation of the law.<ref>[http://www.publicinterestwatch.org/pdfs/PIW_report.pdf Green-Peace, Dirty Money: Tax Violations in the World of Non-Profits]. publicinterestwatch.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617224556/http://www.publicinterestwatch.org/pdfs/PIW_report.pdf |date=17 June 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/208215/seeing-greenpeace |title=Seeing Greenpeace &#124; National Review Online }}</ref> The IRS conducted an extensive review and concluded in December 2005 that Greenpeace USA continued to qualify for its tax-exempt status.

=== Digital transformation ===
International Executive Director [[Kumi Naidoo]] declared the 2009 [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Climate Change Conference]] a "colossal failure" and indicated the organization faced a "burning platform" moment. Naidoo encouraged Greenpeace's international executive directors to embrace new strategies and tactics or risk becoming irrelevant.<ref name="Joslyn">{{Cite web|last=Joslyn|first=Heather|date=June 14, 2018|title=A Group Born at Greenpeace Spreads Ideas About Grass-Roots Advocacy|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/a-group-born-at-greenpeace-spreads-ideas-about-grass-roots-advocacy/|access-date=2020-11-17|website=www.philanthropy.com}}</ref>

To implement a new strategy approved in 2010, Greenpeace hired Michael Silberman to build a "Digital Mobilisation Centre of Excellence" in 2011,<ref name="Joslyn"/> which turned into the Mobilisation Lab ("MobLab").

==Summary of priorities and campaigns==
On its International website, Greenpeace defines its mission as the following:

<blockquote>
"Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation, which uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems, and develop solutions for a green and peaceful future. 
Our goal is to ensure the ability of the earth to nurture life in all its diversity.
That means we want to:<br />
- Stop the planet from warming beyond 1.5º to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of the climate breakdown.<br />
- Protect biodiversity in all its forms.<br />
- Slow the volume of hyper-consumption and learn to live within our means.<br />
- Promote renewable energy as a solution that can power the world.<br />
- Nurture peace, global disarmament and non-violence."<ref>https://www.greenpeace.org/international/explore/about/values/</ref>

===Kingsnorth court case===
In October 2007, six Greenpeace protesters were arrested for breaking into the [[Kingsnorth power station]] in Kent, England; climbing the 200-metre smokestack, painting the name [[Gordon Brown|Gordon]] on the chimney (in reference to former UK Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]]), and causing an estimated £30,000 damage. At their subsequent trial they admitted trying to shut the station down, but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change from causing greater damage to property elsewhere around the world. Evidence was heard from [[David Cameron]]'s environment adviser [[Zac Goldsmith]], climate scientist [[James E. Hansen]] and an [[Inuit]] leader from Greenland, all saying that climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world. The six activists were acquitted. It was the first case where preventing property damage caused by climate change has been used as part of a "lawful excuse" defense in court.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/10/activists.carbonemissions|title=Kingsnorth trial: Coal protesters cleared of criminal damage to chimney|date=2008-10-06|accessdate=2010-01-04|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|first=John|last=Vidal}}</ref> Both [[The Daily Telegraph]] and [[The Guardian]] described the acquittal as embarrassment to the [[Brown Ministry]].<ref>{{cite news| title=Greenpeace Kingsnorth trial collapse is embarrassing for Gordon Brown| date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2010-01-04| newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthcomment/charlesclover/3351572/Greenpeace-Kingsnorth-trial-collapse-is-embarrassing-for-Gordon-Brown.html|location=London|first=Charles|last=Clover}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Not guilty: the Greenpeace activists who used climate change as a legal defense| date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2010-01-04| newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/11/activists.kingsnorthclimatecamp|location=London|first=John|last=Vidal}}</ref> In December 2008 ''[[The New York Times]]'' listed the acquittal in its annual list of the most influential ideas of the year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/magazine/14Ideas-Section2-A-t-004.html?_r=1|title=8th annual year in ideas – Climate-Change Defense|work=The New York Times|first=Jonathan|last=Mingle|date=2008-12-14|accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref>

==="Go Beyond Oil"===

As part of their stance on [[renewable energy commercialisation]], Greenpeace have launched the "Go Beyond Oil" campaign.<ref name="GoBeyondOil">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/oil |title=Go beyond oil &#124; Greenpeace UK |publisher=Greenpeace.org.uk |accessdate=2011-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103152843/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/oil |archive-date=3 November 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The campaign is focused on slowing, and eventually ending, the world's consumption of oil; with activist activities taking place against companies that pursue oil drilling as a venture. Much of the activities of the "Go Beyond Oil" campaign have been focused on drilling for oil in the Arctic and areas affected by the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'' disaster. The activities of Greenpeace in the arctic have mainly involved the Edinburgh-based oil and gas exploration company, Cairn Energy; and range from protests at the Cairn Energy's headquarters<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/paula-bear-wheres-your-spill-response-plan-cairn-20110526 |title=Paula Bear: Where's your spill response plan, Cairn? &#124; Greenpeace UK |publisher=Greenpeace.org.uk |date=2011-05-29 |accessdate=2011-06-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529153618/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/paula-bear-wheres-your-spill-response-plan-cairn-20110526 |archive-date=29 May 2011}}</ref> to scaling their oil rigs in an attempt to halt the drilling process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/update-arctic-pod-48-hours-and-going-strong-20110531 |title=Update from the Arctic pod: 48 hours and going strong! &#124; Greenpeace UK |publisher=Greenpeace.org.uk |accessdate=2011-06-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609045410/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/update-arctic-pod-48-hours-and-going-strong-20110531 |archive-date=9 June 2011}}</ref>

The "Go Beyond Oil" campaign also involves applying political pressure on the governments who allow oil exploration in their territories; with the group stating that one of the key aims of the "Go Beyond Oil" campaign is to "work to expose the lengths the oil industry is willing to go to squeeze the last barrels out of the ground and put pressure on industry and governments to move beyond oil."<ref name = "GoBeyondOil" />

===Nuclear power===
{{Anti-nuclear movement sidebar}}
Greenpeace is opposed to [[nuclear power]] because it views it as 'dangerous, polluting, expensive and non-renewable'. The organization highlights the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011]] as evidence of the risk nuclear power can pose to peoples lives, the environment and the economy.<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/Solutions/Reject-false-solutions/No-to-nuclear/ Nuclear power is part of the problem]. Greenpeace. Published 1 July 2016. Retrieved 5 February 2017.</ref> Greenpeace views the benefits of nuclear power to be relatively minor in comparison to its major problems and risks, such as environmental damage and risks from uranium mining, nuclear weapons proliferation, and unresolved questions concerning nuclear waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/nuclear/problems |title=Nuclear Problems |publisher=Greenpeace.org.uk |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> The organization argues that the potential of nuclear power to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate global warming]] is marginal, referring to the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] energy scenario where an increase in world's nuclear capacity from 2608 TWh in 2007 to 9857 TWh by 2050 would cut global greenhouse gas emissions less than 5% and require 32 nuclear reactor units of 1000MW capacity built per year until 2050. According to Greenpeace the slow construction times, construction delays, and hidden costs, all negate the mitigation potential of nuclear power. This makes the IEA scenario technically and financially unrealistic. They also argue that binding massive amounts of investments on nuclear energy would take funding away from more effective solutions.<ref name="greenpeace1"/> Greenpeace views the construction of [[European Pressurized Reactor#Olkiluoto 3 pilot power plant|Olkiluoto 3]] nuclear power plant in [[Finland]] as an example of the problems on building new nuclear power.<ref name="waste of time">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/nuclear-power-a-dangerous-was.pdf |title=Greenpeace International: 'Nuclear Power: a dangerous waste of time'|accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref>

====Anti-nuclear advertisement====
In 1994, Greenpeace published an anti-nuclear newspaper advert which included a claim that nuclear facilities [[Sellafield]] would kill 2,000 people in the next 10 years, and an image of a [[hydrocephalus]]-affected child said to be a victim of [[Semipalatinsk Test Site|nuclear weapons testing in Kazakhstan]]. [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] viewed the claim concerning Sellafield as unsubstantiated, and ASA did not accept that the child's condition was caused by radiation. This resulted in the banning of the advert. Greenpeace did not admit fault, stating that a Kazakhstan doctor had said that the child's condition was due to nuclear testing. Adam Woolf from Greenpeace also stated that, "fifty years ago there were many experts who would be lined up and swear there was no link between smoking and bad health."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/greenpeace-accused-of-telling-lies-in-advert-watchdog-bans-antinuclear-image-1447196.html|title=Greenpeace accused of telling lies in advert|newspaper=The Independent|date=1994-09-07|accessdate=2009-12-13|location=London|first=Rhys|last=Williams}}</ref> The UN has estimated that the nuclear weapon tests in Kazakhstan caused about 100,000 people to suffer over three generations.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1516889.stm|work=BBC News|title=Kazakhstan highlights nuclear test aftermath|date=2001-08-30}}</ref>

====EDF spying conviction and appeal====
In 2011, a French court fined [[Électricité de France]] (EDF) €1.5m and jailed two senior employees for spying on Greenpeace, including hacking into Greenpeace's computer systems.

Acknowledging that mass production of palm oil may be disastrous on biodiversity of forests, Greenpeace is actively campaigning against the production, urging the industries and the government to turn to other forms of energy resources. One of the positive results of the campaign was GAR(Golden Agri-Resources),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenagri.com.sg/ |title=Golden-Agri Resources official website |publisher=Goldenagri.com.sg |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> the world's second largest palm oil production company, deciding to commit itself to forest conservation. The company signed an agreement which prevents them from developing plantations in areas where large amounts of carbon are locked up.

On the promotional side, an example of Greenpeace's success in the area is a viral video from 2016 protesting [[Nestlé]]'s use of palm oil in [[Kit Kat]] bars.

In June 1995, Greenpeace took a trunk of a tree from the forests of the proposed [[national park]] of Koitajoki<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=93031 |title=Finland's environmental administration, 1995 |publisher=Ymparisto.fi |accessdate=2011-02-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312055411/http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=93031 |archive-date=12 March 2012}}</ref> in [[Ilomantsi]], Finland and put it on display at exhibitions held in Austria and Germany. Greenpeace said in a press conference that the tree was originally from a logged area in the [[ancient forest]] which was supposed to be protected. [[Metsähallitus]] accused Greenpeace of theft and said that the tree was from a normal forest and had been left standing because of its old age.

=== Wilmar International Palm Oil Issue ===
{{see also|Wilmar_International#Ethical_issues}}
25 June 2018 – After an investigation conducted by Greenpeace International, it has been revealed that Wilmar International (the world's largest palm oil trader) is still linked to forest destruction in the Indonesian province of Papua. The deforestation conducted by Gama (a palm oil business run by senior Wilmar executives) has reached twice the size of Paris. Greenpeace is also calling Wilmar out for breaking the commitment to end deforestation policy signed by Wilmar in December 2013 where they promise to incorporate organic and sustainable ways to collect palm oil.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/17248/worlds-largest-palm-oil-trader-linked-to-rainforest-destruction-twice-the-size-of-paris/|title=World's largest palm oil trader linked to rainforest destruction twice the size of Paris - Greenpeace International|work=Greenpeace International|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}</ref>

Greenpeace's 2018 report asserted that Wilmar International is "the biggest and dirtiest palm oil trader in the world".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/19292/oreo-maker-linked-to-destruction-of-orangutan-habitat-for-palm-oil-in-indonesia/|title=Oreo maker linked to destruction of orangutan habitat for palm oil in Indonesia|date=November 13, 2018 |website=Greenpeace.org |access-date=November 16, 2018 }}</ref>

Global head of Greenpeace on Southeast Asia, Kiki Taufik, argues that "Wilmar must immediately cut off all palm oil suppliers that can’t prove they aren’t destroying rainforests." He also added that "Wilmar has been trading Gama’s oil all over the world, including top brands like P&G, Nestlé and Unilever. Brands cannot let this deception pass unchallenged and have no choice but to suspend all business with Wilmar until it can prove it only trades clean palm oil from responsible producers."<ref>{{Citation|last1=Rajanaidu|first1=N.|title=Diversity in the genetic resources of oil palm|date=2018-02-09|work=Achieving sustainable cultivation of oil palm Volume 1|pages=93–116|publisher=Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing|isbn=9781786761040|last2=Mohd Din|first2=A.|last3=Marhalil|first3=M.|last4=Norziha|first4=A.|last5=Meilina|first5=O.

Until now, Wilmar's executives have only denied the accusation labeling them as "false" and are not taking any blame on them. The debate remains unsolved.

=== Resolute Forest Products Issue ===
The [[logging]] company [[Resolute Forest Products]] sued Greenpeace several times since 2013.

==Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)==
Greenpeace has also supported the rejection of [[Genetically modified food|GM food]] from the US in famine-stricken Zambia as long as supplies of non-genetically engineered grain exist, stating that the US "should follow in the European Union's footsteps and allow aid recipients to choose their food aid, buying it locally if they wish. This practice can stimulate developing economies and creates more robust food security", adding that, "if Africans truly have no other alternative, the controversial GE maize should be milled so it can't be planted. It was this condition that allowed Zambia's neighbours Zimbabwe and Malawi to accept it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/eat-this-or-die/ |title=Eat this or die, The poison politics of food aid |publisher=Greenpeace |date=2002-09-30 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref> After Zambia banned all GM food aid, the former agricultural minister of Zambia criticized, "how the various international NGOs that have spoken approvingly of the government's action will square the body count with their various consciences."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/oct/30/gm.food|title=Zambia slams door shut on GM relief food|first=Carrol|last=Rory|date=2002-10-30|accessdate=2010-10-18|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}</ref> Concerning the decision of Zambia, Greenpeace has stated that, "it was obvious to us that if no non-GM aid was being offered then they should absolutely accept GM food aid.

===Greenpeace on golden rice===
Greenpeace opposes the planned use of [[golden rice]], a variety of ''[[Oryza sativa]]'' [[rice]] produced through [[genetic engineering]] to [[biosynthesis|biosynthesize]] [[beta-carotene]], a precursor of pro-[[retinol|vitamin A]] in the edible parts of rice. The addition of beta-carotene to the rice is seen as preventive to loss of sight in poverty stricken countries where golden rice is intended for distribution. According to Greenpeace, golden rice has not managed to do anything about malnutrition for 10 years during which alternative methods are already tackling malnutrition. The alternative proposed by Greenpeace is to discourage [[monocropping]] and to increase production of crops which are naturally nutrient-rich (containing other nutrients not found in golden rice in addition to beta-[[carotene]]). Greenpeace argues that resources should be spent on programs that are already working and helping to relieve malnutrition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/Greenpeace-and-Golden-Rice/ |title=and golden rice |publisher=Greenpeace |date=2010-11-05 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref>

The renewal of these concerns coincided with the publication of a paper in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' about a version of golden rice with much higher levels of beta carotene.<ref>Paine JA, Shipton CA, Chaggar S, Howells RM, Kennedy MJ, Vernon G, Wright SY, Hinchliffe E, Adams JL, Silverstone AL, Drake R (2005) A new version of Golden Rice with increased pro-vitamin A content.

==Toxic waste==

In July 2011, Greenpeace released its Dirty Laundry report accusing some of the world's top fashion and [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] brands of releasing [[toxic waste]] into China's rivers.<ref>Greenpeace.[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/ Dirty Laundry: Unravelling the corporate connections to toxic water pollution in China].</ref> The report profiles the problem of [[water pollution]] resulting from the release of toxic chemicals associated with the country's [[textile industry]]. Investigations focused on [[wastewater]] discharges from two facilities in China; one belonging to the [[Youngor Group]] located on the [[Yangtze River Delta]] and the other to Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the [[Pearl River Delta]]. Scientific analysis of samples from both facilities revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent [[hormone disruptor]] chemicals, including [[alkylphenol]]s, [[perfluorinated compound]]s and [[perfluorooctane sulfonate]].
  
The report goes on to assert that the Youngor Group and Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. - the two companies behind the facilities - have commercial relationships with a range of major clothing brands, including [[Abercrombie & Fitch]], [[Adidas]], [[Bauer Hockey]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]], [[Cortefiel]], [[H&M]], [[Lacoste]], [[Li Ning (company)|Li Ning]], [[Metersbonwe Group]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Phillips-Van Heusen]] and [[Puma AG]].

In 2013, Greenpeace launched the "Detox Fashion" campaign, which signed up some fashion brands to stop the discharge of toxic chemicals into rivers as a result of the production of their clothes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/water/detox/|title=Detox|work=Greenpeace International}}</ref>

===Guide to Greener Electronics===

In August 2006, Greenpeace released the first edition of Guide to Greener Electronics, a magazine where mobile and PC manufacturers were ranked for their green performance, mainly based in the use of toxic materials in their products and [[electronic waste|e-waste]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/planet-2/report/2007/12/greener-electronics-guide.pdf|title = Guide to Greener Electronics|date = August 2006|accessdate = 2015-11-18|publisher = Greenpeace}}</ref> In November 2011, the criteria were updated, as the industry had progressed since 2006, with the objective to get companies to set goals for greenhouse gas reduction, the use of renewable power up to 100 percent, producing long lasting products free of hazardous substances and increasing sustainable practices. To ensure the transparency of the ranking the companies are assessed based only on their public information. For proving companies' policies and practices, Greenpeace uses chemical testing of products, reports from industry observers, media reports and testing of consumer programs to check if they match with their actions. Since the Guide was released in 2006, along with other similar campaigns has driven numerous improvements, when companies ranked eliminate toxic chemicals from their products and improve their recycling schemes. The last published edition of Guide to Greener Electronics was in 2017. The 2017 version included 17 major IT companies and ranked them on three criteria: energy use, [[resource consumption]] and chemical elimination.<ref name=GreenpeaceElectronics2017>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/greener-electronics-2017/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics 2017 |publisher=Greenpeace USA  |year=2017}}</ref>

==Save the Arctic==

In continuity of the successful campaign to reach the [[Antarctic-Environmental Protocol]], in 2012 and 2013 protests with "Save the Arctic" banners were started. To stop oil- and gas-drilling, [[fishing industry|industrial fishing]] and military operations in the [[Arctic]] region completely, a "global sanctuary in the high arctic" was demanded from the World leaders at the UN General Assembly: "We want them to pass a UN resolution expressing international concern for the Arctic."

===Norway===
There is a conflict over oil rigs in the [[Arctic Ocean]] between the [[Norwegian Government]] and Greenpeace.<ref>{{Cite web|date=July 1, 2017|title=“Norway: Disaster Risk in the Arctic.” The Outlaw Ocean Project|url=https://www.theoutlawocean.com/arctic-drilling-raises-concerns-for-high-risk-area/}}</ref> In 2013, three activists of Greenpeace got on a [[Statoil]]'s oil rig, wearing bear suits. According to a spokesman from Greenpeace [[Russia]], they stayed on the rig for about three hours. The activists in bear suits "were escorted" to the shore. [[Statoil]] reportedly did not intend to file a suit against them.<ref>[http://en.ria.ru/world/20130410/180561634.html Greenpeace's Polar Bears Board Norwegian Oil Rig]. RIA Novosti (2013-0410).</ref>

Greenpeace had argued that Statoil's drilling plans posed a threat to [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]], an uninhabited wildlife sanctuary that is home to rare species including polar bears, because an oil spill would be nearly impossible to clean up in the Arctic because of the harsh conditions.<ref>Offshore Technology.com.

We have established robust plans for the operation, and feel confident they can be carried out safely and without accidents."

On 27 May 2014, Greenpeace's ship, [[MV Esperanza|MV ''Esperanza'']], took over [[Transocean]] [[Spitsbergen]], oil rig of [[Statoil]]<ref>Statoil. (2 June 2014). [http://www.statoil.com/en/NewsAndMedia/News/2014/Pages/30May_Hoop.aspx Ministry rejects Greenpeace appeal].</ref> in the Barents Sea such that it became incapable of operating. After that, the manager of Greenpeace [[Norway]] Truls Gulowsen answered a phone interview, stating that "Five protesters left the rig by helicopter last night and three returned to a nearby Greenpeace ship."<ref name="bloomberg.com">Holter, M.

Bloomberg.</ref> There were seven more protesters on the rig at the time, but the Norwegian police could not remove them immediately because the rig was a [[flag of convenience]] ship registered in the Marshall Islands and thus regarded as a ship in the open sea, as long as it did not begin drilling. On 29 May, however, the seven activists from Greenpeace were peacefully captured by Norwegian police on the rig. Soon after, according to [[Reuters]], all the activists were set free without any fine. On 30 May, the [[Norwegian Coast Guard]] finally towed away ''Esperanza'', though in the morning Greenpeace submitted a plea on which more than 80,000 signatures to the Norwegian Environment Minister [[Tine Sundtoft]] in Oslo were written. Norwegian government and police reportedly allowed the coast guard to tow the Greenpeace ship.<ref name =Norwaymoves>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/world/europe/norway-moves-in-to-guard-oil-rig-from-greenpeace-arctic-drilling.html?_r=0 Norway Moves In to Guard Oil Rig From Greenpeace]. The New York Times (30 May 2014).</ref>

The Norwegian police stated that Statoil asked Greenpeace to stop preventing its activities, but Greenpeace ignored the warning. The police have stated that Greenpeace's interference with the petroleum activities of Statoil was the contrary to Norwegian law and ordered Greenpeace to leave the Barents Sea site.<ref name = Hovland1>Hovland, K.

According to Reuters, Statoil was slated to begin drilling "three oil wells in the Apollo, Atlantis and Mercury prospects in the Hoop area, [which is] some 300&nbsp;km away from the mainland [of Norway]" in the summer of 2014. Greenpeace has continued to criticize the big oil company for their "[[green wash]]," arguing that Statoil hid the truth that it is doing the risky oil drilling by holding "[[Lego League]]" with Lego and distracting people's attention to the company's project, and it also argues that Statoil has to alter its attitude toward environments.<ref>[http://www.newsinenglish.no/2014/07/10/greenpeace-we-need-a-new-statoil/ Greenpeace: 'We need a new Statoil'].

====First ''Rainbow Warrior''====
{{main|Rainbow Warrior (1955){{!}}''Rainbow Warrior'' (1955)}}
{{See also|Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior{{!}}Sinking of the ''Rainbow Warrior''}}
In 1978, Greenpeace launched the original ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]'', a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}}, former fishing [[Commercial trawler|trawler]] named after the book ''[[Legend of the Rainbow Warriors|Warriors of the Rainbow]]'', which inspired early activist [[Robert Hunter (journalist)|Robert Hunter]] on the first voyage to Amchitka. Greenpeace purchased the ''Rainbow Warrior'' (originally launched as the ''Sir William Hardy'' in 1955) at a cost of £40,000. Volunteers restored and refitted it over a period of four months. First deployed to disrupt the hunt of the [[Iceland]]ic whaling fleet, the ''Rainbow Warrior'' quickly became a mainstay of Greenpeace campaigns. Between 1978 and 1985, crew members also engaged in direct action against the ocean-dumping of toxic and radioactive waste, the [[grey seal]] hunt in [[Orkney]] and nuclear testing in the Pacific. In May 1985, the vessel was instrumental for 'Operation Exodus', the evacuation of about 300 [[Rongelap Atoll]] islanders whose home had been contaminated with nuclear fallout from a US nuclear test two decades earlier which had never been cleaned up and was still having severe health effects on the locals.<ref name="GREEN">"[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/history/mejato.htm "The evacuation of Rongelap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213074238/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/history/mejato.htm |date=13 February 2007 }}</ref>

Later in 1985 the ''Rainbow Warrior'' was to lead a flotilla of protest vessels into the waters surrounding [[Moruroa]] atoll, site of French nuclear testing. The [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sinking of the ''Rainbow Warrior'']] occurred when the [[French government]] secretly bombed the ship in [[Auckland]] harbour on orders from [[François Mitterrand]] himself. This killed Dutch freelance photographer [[Fernando Pereira]], who thought it was safe to enter the boat to get his photographic material after a first small explosion, but drowned as a result of a second, larger explosion.<ref>{{cite news| title=Rainbow Warrior ringleader heads firm selling arms to US government|date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2010-01-21|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/may/25/usnews.france|location=London|first=Suzanne|last=Goldenberg}}</ref> The attack was a public relations disaster for France after it was quickly exposed by the New Zealand police. The French Government in 1987 agreed to pay New Zealand compensation of [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]13 million and formally apologised for the bombing. The French Government also paid [[French franc|₣]]2.3 million compensation to the family of the photographer. Later, in 2001, when the [[Institute of Cetacean Research]] of Japan called Greenpeace "[[Ecoterrorism|eco-terrorists]]", Gert Leipold, then Executive Director of Greenpeace, detested the claim, saying "calling non-violent protest terrorism insults those who were injured or killed in the attacks of real terrorists, including Fernando Pereira, killed by State terrorism in the 1985 attack on the ''Rainbow Warrior''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/pressreleases/oceans/2001dec14.html |title=Greenpeace Rejects Terrorism Label, 14 December 2001 |publisher=Archive.greenpeace.org |date=2001-12-14 |accessdate=2011-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510164356/http://archive.greenpeace.org/pressreleases/oceans/2001dec14.html|archive-date=2012-05-10}}</ref>

In 1989 Greenpeace commissioned a replacement Rainbow Warrior vessel, sometimes referred to as ''Rainbow Warrior II''. It retired from service on 16 August 2011, to be replaced by the third generation vessel. In 2005 the ''Rainbow Warrior II'' ran aground on and damaged the [[Tubbataha Reef]] in the Philippines while inspecting the reef for [[coral bleaching]]. Greenpeace was fined [[United States dollar|US$]]7,000 for damaging the reef and agreed to pay the fine saying they felt responsible for the damage, although Greenpeace stated that the Philippines government had given it outdated charts. The park manager of Tubbataha appreciated the quick action Greenpeace took to assess the damage to the reef.<ref>[[BBC News]].

A French journalist under the pen name Olivier Vermont wrote in his book ''La Face cachée de Greenpeace'' ("The Hidden Face of Greenpeace") that he had joined Greenpeace France and had worked there as a secretary. According to Vermont he found misconduct, and continued to find it, from Amsterdam to the International office. Vermont said he found classified documents<ref>{{Citation|title=La Face cachée de Greenpeace |author=Olivier Vermont |page=337 |editor=Albin Michel |year= 1997 |language=fr |isbn=978-2-226-08775-1}}</ref> according to which half of the organization's €180 million revenue was used for the organization's salaries and structure. He also accused Greenpeace of having unofficial agreements with polluting companies where the companies paid Greenpeace to keep them from attacking the company's image.<ref>[http://www.agoravox.fr/actualites/environnement/article/developpement-durable-le-concept-65585 Développement durable : le concept dévoyé qui ne doit plus durer !], from the Author of "La Servitude Climatique".</ref> Animal protection magazine ''Animal People'' reported in March 1997 that Greenpeace France and Greenpeace International had sued Olivier Vermont and his publisher Albin Michel for issuing "defamatory statements, untruths, distortions of the facts and absurd allegations".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/97/2/watchdog.html |title=Animal People, March 1997 |publisher=Animalpeoplenews.org |accessdate=2011-02-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722052428/http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/97/2/watchdog.html |archive-date=22 July 2011}}</ref>

===Brent Spar tanker===
Research published in natural science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' accused Greenpeace of not caring for facts when it criticized the dumping of the [[Brent Spar]] tanker, and accused the group of exaggerating the volume of oil that was stored in the tanker.<ref name=nature>{{cite journal | author=Editorial comment | title=Brent Spar, broken spur | journal=Nature | year=1995 | volume=375 | pages=708–709 | doi=10.1038/375708a0 | issue=6534| bibcode=  1995Natur.375..708.| s2cid=4369687 }}</ref> Greenpeace had claimed that the tanker contained 5,500 tonnes of crude oil, while Shell estimated it only contained 50 tonnes.<ref name=iaea/> However, the measurements had been made under duress during a protest occupation of the platform, since Shell had refused permission, and Greenpeace activists had been under attack by water cannons and the like.<ref>Mitchener, 1995, "Environmentalists Apologize...."; https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/06/news/06iht-brent_.html; accessed 10/10/2016</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/20/newsid_4509000/4509527.stm 1995: Shell Makes Dramatic U-Turn]; accessed 17 February 2020</ref> The BBC issued an apology to Greenpeace for having reported that the NGO lied.<ref>"BBC Apologizes to Greenpeace", 1999, accessed 10/10/2016; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/536533.stm</ref>

Shell UK took three years to evaluate the disposal options, concluding that the disposal of the tanker in the deep ocean was the "[[Best Practicable Environmental Option]]" (BPEO), an option which gained some support within some portion of the scientific community, as it was found by some to be of "negligible" environmental impact.<ref name=iaea>[http://www.iaea.org/nuccomtoolbox/documents/Brent_Spar_Case_Study.pdf Case Study: The Environmental Conflict Surrounding the Decommissioning of Brent Spar], [[IAEA]].

AB11 9DB UK.</ref> British government and Oslo and Paris Commissions (OSPAR) accepted the solution.<ref name=iaea/>

The resulting NGO campaign against Shell's proposals included letters, boycotts which even escalated to vandalism in Germany, and lobbying at intergovernmental conferences. Binding moratoriums supporting Greenpeace's, ecosystem protection, and the precautionary principle position were issued in more than one intergovernmental meeting, and at the 1998 OSPAR Convention, WWF presented a study of toxic effects on deep sea ecosystems. The meeting confirmed a general prohibition on ocean dumping.<ref>De LaFayette, Louise "New Developments in the Disposal of Offshore Installations" The International Journal of Marine and Coastal Law, 14:4 1999.</ref> Shell had transported the rig to the dumping site, but in the last hours canceled the operation and announced that it had failed in communicating its plans sufficiently to the public, admitting they had underestimated the strength of public opinion.<ref name=iaea/> In January, 1998, Shell issued a new BPEO indicating recycling the rig as a quay in Norway.<ref>"Brent Spar....", 2010; http://www.ethicalcorp.com/business-strategy/brent-spar-battle-launched-modern-activism; accessed 10/10/2016</ref>

In 1999, the [[Brent Spar]] container was decommissioned and one side issue that emerged was that the legs of the structure were found to contain cold-water coral species (''Lophelia pertusa''). As a result, the possibility was suggested of keeping the legs of such platforms on the sea bed in future, to serve as habitat.<ref name=iaea/><ref>{{cite journal |author = Bell, N. & Smith, J. |year = 1999|title = Coral growing on North Sea oil rigs | journal = Nature | volume = 402 | pages=601–2|doi = 10.1038/45127 |pmid = 10604464 |issue = 6762|last2 = McClive|last3 = Western|last4 = Reed|last5 = Sinclair|bibcode = 1999Natur.402..601B|s2cid = 4401771}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author = Gass, S. & Roberts, J.M. |year = 2006|title = The occurrence of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa (Scleractinia) on oil and gas platforms in the North Sea : Colony growth, recruitment and environmental controls on distribution | journal = Marine Pollution Bulletin | volume = 52 | issue=5|pages=549–559 |doi = 10.1016/j.marpolbul.2005.10.002 |pmid = 16300800|last2 = Roberts}}http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17830117</ref> A Greenpeace representative opposed the suggestion, citing the fact that the reefs formed by the coral are at risk, not the coral itself, and that such a move would not promote development of such reefs, and expose coral species to toxic substances found in oil.<ref>{{cite news | title=Oil rig home to rare coral | work=BBC News, Sci/Tech, Oil rig home to rare coral | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/555777.stm | accessdate=11 February 2007 | date=8 December 1999}}</ref>

===Nazca Lines===
In December 2014, Greenpeace activists damaged rock related to the [[Nazca Lines]] in Peru while setting up a banner within the lines of one of the famed geoglyphs, and there were concerns that the harm might be irreparable. The activists damaged an area around the hummingbird by walking near the glyph without regulation footwear.

===Anti-whaling campaign in Norway in the 1990s===

During the 1990s Greenpeace conducted many anti-whaling expeditions in Norway. The criticism was that Greenpeace only campaigned against whaling to gain economic donations from the US economy, and it had little to do with saving the environment. For example, shark hunting is a more pressing issue, but since sharks are widely feared in the United States, activism to help sharks doesn't receive as much financial support. Greenpeace has rejected this claim. However, in Norwegian Newspaper Dagbladet on 11 April 2015 [[Kumi Naidoo]] admitted that the anti-whale campaign was a "miscalculation".<ref name="m.db.no">{{cite news|url=http://m.db.no/2015/04/10/magasinet/pluss/kumi_naidoo/greenpeace/38574658/|title=Norges oljeøkonomi bidrar til krig og folkemord, hevder Greenpeace-sjef Kumi Naidoo|agency=Dagbladet|date=11 April 2015|ref=1}}</ref> Greenpeace holds that whaling was only resumed by Norway after the IWC ban because of political election motives, and faces many explicit hurdles, including decreased demand in Japan and toxic chemical contamination.<ref>"Norway and whaling," accessed 10/10/2016; http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/fit-for-the-future/whaling/norwegian-whaling/</ref>

===Open letter from Nobel laureates===
In June 2016, 107 Nobel laureates signed an open letter<ref name=openletter/> urging Greenpeace to end its opposition to genetically modified organisms (GMOs).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/29/more-than-100-nobel-laureates-take-on-greenpeace-over-gmo-stance/|title=107 Nobel laureates sign letter blasting Greenpeace over GMOs|website=The Washington Post|access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> The letter stated: "We urge Greenpeace and its supporters to re-examine the experience of farmers and consumers worldwide with crops and foods improved through biotechnology, recognize the findings of authoritative scientific bodies and regulatory agencies, and abandon their campaign against "GMOs" in general and Golden Rice in particular. Scientific and regulatory agencies around the world have repeatedly and consistently found crops and foods improved through biotechnology to be as safe as, if not safer than those derived from any other method of production. There has never been a single confirmed case of a negative health outcome for humans or animals from their consumption. Their environmental impacts have been shown repeatedly to be less damaging to the environment, and a boon to global biodiversity." The Nobel laureates also called upon governments of the world to "do everything in their power to oppose Greenpeace's actions and accelerate the access of farmers to all the tools of modern biology, especially seeds improved through biotechnology." The letter goes on to say that "Opposition based on emotion and dogma contradicted by data must be stopped."<ref name=openletter/> Greenpeace responded stating that "Accusations that anyone is blocking genetically engineered 'Golden' rice are false" and that they support "[...] investing in climate-resilient ecological agriculture and empowering farmers to access a balanced and nutritious diet, rather than pouring money down the drain for GE 'Golden' rice."<ref name=reactive_statement/>

The Nobel laureate letter was criticised by Silvia Ribeiro of the [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]], calling it more of "a propaganda tirade from transgenic companies than scientists presenting a position," and arguing against its claimed benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.etcgroup.org/content/nobel-laureates-serving-monsanto-and-syngenta |title= Silvia Ribeiro |work= [[ETC Group (AGETC)]] |accessdate= 2017-03-19}}</ref>
