Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the [[Avanti! (newspaper)|''Avanti!'' newspaper]]. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism|author=Anthony James Gregor|isbn=978-0520037991|publisher=University of California Press|year=1979}}</ref> but was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in [[World War I]], in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'', and served in the [[Royal Italian Army]] during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on [[Italian nationalism]] instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose [[egalitarianism]]<ref name="Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi 1997 45">{{cite book|author=Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi|title=Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vcFQTOsRXgC&pg=PA45|year=1997|publisher=U of California Press|page=45|isbn=978-0520926158|access-date=11 June 2017|archive-date=23 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200423103648/https://books.google.com/books?id=_vcFQTOsRXgC&pg=PA45|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[class conflict]], instead advocating "[[Revolutionary nationalism#Benito Mussolini's revolutionary nationalism|revolutionary nationalism]]" [[class collaboration|transcending class lines]].{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=191}} Following the [[March on Rome]] in October 1922, Mussolini became the youngest Italian prime minister up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes,<ref name=Haugen_p9_71>[[#Haugen|Haugen]], pp. 9, 71</ref> Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a [[one-party state|one-party dictatorship]]. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the [[Lateran Treaty]] with the Vatican, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the Papacy, and recognized the independence of [[Vatican City]].

Mussolini's foreign policy aimed to expand the sphere of influence of Italian fascism. In 1923, he began the "[[Pacification of Libya]]" and [[Corfu incident|ordered the bombing of Corfu]] in retaliation for the murder of an Italian general. In 1936, Mussolini formed [[Italian East Africa]] (AOI) by merging [[Eritrea]], [[Italian Somaliland|Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]] following the [[Abyssinian crisis]] and the [[Second Italo–Ethiopian War]]. In 1939, Italian forces occupied [[Albania]]. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful [[Italian military intervention in Spain]] in favor of [[Francisco Franco]] during the [[Spanish civil war]]. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the [[Brenner Pass]] to delay [[Anschluss]] and taking part in the [[Stresa front]], the [[Lytton Report]], the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the [[Four-Power Pact]] and the [[Munich Agreement]]. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by [[Axis powers|aligning]] with Germany and Japan. Germany [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of [[World War II]].

On 10 June 1940—with the [[Fall of France]] imminent—Italy officially entered the war and eventually occupied [[Italian occupation of France|parts of south-east France]], [[Italian occupation of Corsica|Corsica]], and [[Tunisian campaign|Tunisia]]. Mussolini planned to concentrate Italian forces on a major offensive against the [[British Empire]] in Africa and the Middle East, known as the "parallel war", while expecting the collapse of the UK in the [[European theatre of world war II|European theatre]]. The Italians [[Italian invasion of Egypt|invaded Egypt]], [[Italian bombing of Mandatory Palestine in World War II|bombed Mandatory Palestine]], and [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|occupied British Somaliland]] with initial success. However, the British government refused to accept proposals for a peace that would involve accepting [[Axis Powers|Axis]] victories in Europe; plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed and the war continued. In October 1940, Mussolini sent Italian forces into Greece, starting the [[Greco-Italian War]]. The [[Royal Air Force]] prevented the Italian invasion and allowed the Greeks to push the Italians back to Albania. Despite this, the Greek counter-offensive in Italian Albania ended in a stalemate that allowed the Germans to by-pass Greek defences and invade the country. Italy subsequently took part in the [[Axis occupation of Greece]] and [[Occupation of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IoIlDwAAQBAJ&q=Italian+forces+in+Greece+british+air+force&pg=PT85|title = The Desert Air Force in World War II: Air Power in the Western Desert, 1940-1942|isbn = 9781526703798|last1 = Delve|first1 = Ken Delve|date = 31 March 2017|access-date = 3 June 2020|archive-date = 25 September 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200925055442/https://books.google.com/books?id=IoIlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&dq=Italian+forces+in+Greece+british+air+force|url-status = live}}</ref>

As a consequence, early on 25 July, the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day [[Victor Emmanuel III|the King]] dismissed him as [[head of government]] and had him placed in custody, appointing [[Pietro Badoglio]] to succeed him as Prime Minister.

After the king agreed the armistice with the allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the [[Gran Sasso raid]] by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Fallschirmjäger (World War II)|paratroopers]] and ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' [[commando]]s led by Major [[Harald Mors|Otto-Harald Mors]]. Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the [[Italian Social Republic]] ({{lang-it|Repubblica Sociale Italiana}}, RSI),{{sfn|Moseley|2004|p=}} informally known as the ''Salò Republic''.

Mussolini was born on 29 July 1883 in [[Predappio|Dovia di Predappio]], a small town in the [[province of Forlì]] in [[Romagna]]. Later, during the Fascist era, Predappio was dubbed "Duce's town" and Forlì was called "Duce's city", with pilgrims going to Predappio and Forlì to see the birthplace of Mussolini.

Benito Mussolini's father, [[Alessandro Mussolini]], was a [[blacksmith]] and a socialist,<ref name="Mediterranean3">{{cite book|title=Mediterranean Fascism 1919–1945 |editor=Charles F. Delzel|publisher=Harper Rowe |year=1970| page =3}}</ref> while his mother, [[Rosa Maltoni|Rosa]] (née Maltoni), was a devout Catholic schoolteacher.<ref name="Grolier encyclopedia">{{Cite news|url=http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_mussolini.html |publisher=Grolier.com |title=Benito Mussolini |date=8 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205165430/http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_mussolini.html |archivedate=5 February 2008}}</ref> Given his father's political leanings, Mussolini was named Benito after liberal Mexican president [[Benito Juárez]], while his middle names, Andrea and Amilcare, were for Italian socialists [[Andrea Costa]] and [[Amilcare Cipriani]].<ref name="Living History 2">{{cite book|last1=Tonge|first1=M.E.|last2=Henry|first2=Stephen|last3=Collins|first3=Gráinne|title=Living history 2: Italy under Fascism|date=2004|publisher=EDCO|location=Dublin|isbn=978-1-84536-028-3|edition=New|chapter=Chapter 2}}</ref> Benito was the eldest of his parents' three children.

As a young boy, Mussolini would spend some time helping his father in his smithy.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Felice|first=Renzo|title=Mussolini. Il Rivoluzionario|year=1965|publisher=Einaudi|location=Torino|page=11|edition=1|language=Italian}}</ref> Mussolini's early political views were strongly influenced by his father, who idolized 19th-century [[Italian nationalist]] figures with [[Humanism|humanist]] tendencies such as [[Carlo Pisacane]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=29}} His father's political outlook combined views of [[Anarchism|anarchist]] figures such as [[Carlo Cafiero]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]], the military [[authoritarianism]] of Garibaldi, and the nationalism of Mazzini. In 1902, at the anniversary of Garibaldi's death, Mussolini made a public speech in praise of the [[Republicanism|republican]] nationalist.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=31}}

The conflict between his parents about religion meant that, unlike most Italians, Mussolini was not baptized at birth and would not be until much later in life. As a compromise between his parents, Mussolini was sent to a [[boarding school]] run by [[Salesian]] monks. After joining a new school, Mussolini achieved good grades, and qualified as an elementary schoolmaster in 1901.<ref name="Grolier encyclopedia" />

=== Emigration to Switzerland and military service ===
[[File:Mussolini mugshot 1903 Bern.jpg|thumb|left|Mussolini's booking file following his arrest by the police on 19 June 1903, [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]]]]
{{Mussolini sidebar}}
In 1902, Mussolini [[emigration|emigrated]] to Switzerland, partly to avoid compulsory military service.<ref name="Mediterranean3" /> He worked briefly as a [[stonemason]] in Geneva, [[Fribourg]] and [[Bern]], but was unable to find a permanent job.

During this time he studied the ideas of the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], the [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Vilfredo Pareto]], and the [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]]. Mussolini also later credited the [[Christian socialist]] [[Charles Péguy]] and the [[syndicalist]] [[Hubert Lagardelle]] as some of his influences.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mediterranean Fascism by Charles F. Delzel p. 96</ref> Sorel's emphasis on the need for overthrowing decadent [[liberal democracy]] and capitalism by the use of violence, [[direct action]], the [[general strike]] and the use of [[Machiavelli|neo-Machiavellian]] appeals to emotion, impressed Mussolini deeply.<ref name="Mediterranean3" />

Mussolini became active in the Italian socialist movement in Switzerland, working for the paper ''L'Avvenire del Lavoratore'', organizing meetings, giving speeches to workers, and serving as secretary of the Italian workers' union in [[Lausanne]].<ref name=HDS>{{HDS|27903|author=Mauro Cerutti}}</ref> [[Angelica Balabanov]] reportedly introduced him to [[Vladimir Lenin]], who later criticized Italian socialists for having lost Mussolini from their cause.{{r|gunther1940}} In 1903, he was arrested by the Bernese police because of his advocacy of a violent general strike, spent two weeks in jail, and was deported to Italy. After he was released there, he returned to Switzerland.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Haugen |first=Brenda |title=Benito Mussolini |publisher=Compass Point Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7565-1892-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rleP5CVe070C&pg=PA24 |access-date=3 June 2020 |archive-date=25 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925055443/https://books.google.com/books?id=rleP5CVe070C&pg=PA24 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1904, having been arrested again in Geneva and expelled for falsifying his papers, Mussolini returned to Lausanne, where he attended the [[University of Lausanne]]'s Department of [[Social Science]], following the lessons of [[Vilfredo Pareto]].<ref>{{cite book|last=De Felice|first=Renzo|title=Mussolini.

He had been convicted for this ''in absentia''.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Felice|first=Renzo|title=Mussolini.

=== Political journalist, intellectual and socialist ===
In February 1909,<ref>Georg Scheuer: ''Mussolinis langer Schatten. Marsch auf Rom im Nadelstreif.'' Köln 1996, S. 21.</ref> Mussolini again left Italy, this time to take the job as the secretary of the labor party in the Italian-speaking city of [[Trento]], which at the time was part of [[Austria-Hungary]] (it is now within Italy). He also did office work for the local Socialist Party, and edited its newspaper ''L'Avvenire del Lavoratore'' (''The Future of the Worker''). Returning to Italy, he spent a brief time in Milan, and in 1910 he returned to his hometown of Forlì, where he edited the weekly ''Lotta di classe'' (''The Class Struggle'').

Mussolini thought of himself as an intellectual and was considered to be well-read. He read avidly; his favorites in European philosophy included Sorel, the Italian Futurist [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], French Socialist [[Gustave Hervé]], Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]], and German philosophers [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Marx]], the founders of [[Marxism]].<ref>Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini; A biography'' (1982) pp. 9–13</ref><ref>R.J.B. Bosworth, ''Mussolini'' (2002) pp. 55–68</ref> Mussolini had taught himself French and German and translated excerpts from Nietzsche, [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Kant]].

During this time, he published "Il Trentino veduto da un Socialista" ("[[Trentino]] as seen by a Socialist") in the radical periodical ''La Voce''.<ref>Margherita G. Sarfatti, ''The Life of Benito Mussolini'' p. 156</ref> He also wrote several essays about German literature, some stories, and one novel: ''L'amante del Cardinale: Claudia Particella, romanzo storico'' (''The Cardinal's Mistress''). This novel he co-wrote with Santi Corvaja, and it was published as a serial book in the Trento newspaper ''Il Popolo''. It was released in installments from 20 January to 11 May 1910.<ref>taken from WorldCat's entry for this book's title.</ref> The novel was bitterly anticlerical, and years later was withdrawn from circulation after Mussolini made a truce with the Vatican.<ref name="Mediterranean3" />

He had become one of Italy's most prominent socialists. In September 1911, Mussolini participated in a riot, led by socialists, against the Italian [[Italo-Turkish War|war in Libya]]. He bitterly denounced Italy's "imperialist war", an action that earned him a five-month jail term.<ref>Charles F. Delzel, ed., ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919–1945'' (1970) p. 3</ref> After his release, he helped expel [[Ivanoe Bonomi]] and [[Leonida Bissolati]] from the Socialist Party, as they were two "[[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]]" who had supported the war.

He was rewarded the editorship of the Socialist Party newspaper [[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|''Avanti!'']] Under his leadership, its circulation soon rose from 20,000 to 100,000.<ref name="Mediterranean4">Delzel, ed., ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919–1945'' p. 4</ref> [[John Gunther]] in 1940 called him "one of the best journalists alive"; Mussolini was a working reporter while preparing for the March on Rome, and wrote for the [[Hearst News Service]] until 1935.{{r|gunther1940}} Mussolini was so familiar with Marxist literature that in his own writings he would not only quote from well-known Marxist works but also from the relatively obscure works.<ref>Anthony James Gregor, ''Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism,'' pp. 41–42</ref> During this period Mussolini considered himself a Marxist and he described Marx as "the greatest of all theorists of socialism."<ref>Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini: A Biography,'' (1983), p. 7</ref>

In 1913, he published ''Giovanni Hus, il veridico'' (''Jan Hus, true prophet''), an historical and political biography about the life and mission of the Czech ecclesiastic reformer [[Jan Hus]] and his militant followers, the [[Hussite]]s. During this socialist period of his life, Mussolini sometimes used the pen name ''"Vero Eretico"'' ("sincere heretic").<ref>Bosworth, ''Mussolini'' (2002) p. 86</ref>

Mussolini rejected [[egalitarianism]], a core doctrine of socialism.<ref name="Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi 1997 45"/> He was influenced by Nietzsche's anti-Christian ideas and [[God is dead|negation of God's existence]].{{sfn|Golomb|2002|p=249}} Mussolini felt that socialism had faltered, in view of the failures of Marxist [[Economic determinism|determinism]] and [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[reformism]], and believed that Nietzsche's ideas would strengthen socialism. While associated with socialism, Mussolini's writings eventually indicated that he had abandoned Marxism and egalitarianism in favor of Nietzsche's [[übermensch]] concept and anti-egalitarianism.{{sfn|Golomb|2002|p=249}}

=== Expulsion from the Italian Socialist Party ===
[[File:Benito Mussolini PSI.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Mussolini as director of ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]'']]
A number of socialist parties initially supported [[World War I]] at the time it began in August 1914.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=1001}} Once the war started, Austrian, British, French, and German socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their country's intervention in the war.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=884}} The outbreak of the war had resulted in a surge of [[Italian nationalism]] and the war was supported by a variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] who promoted [[Italian irredentism]] and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=335}} The [[Italian Liberal Party]] under the leadership of [[Paolo Boselli]] promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and utilized the [[Società Dante Alighieri]] to promote Italian nationalism.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=219}}{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=826}} Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=209}} Prior to Mussolini taking a position on the war, a number of revolutionary [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]] had announced their support of intervention, including [[Alceste De Ambris]], [[Filippo Corridoni]], and [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti]].{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=189}} The [[Italian Socialist Party]] decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors had been killed, resulting in a general strike called [[Red Week (Italy)|Red Week]].{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=596}}

Mussolini initially held official support for the party's decision and, in an August 1914 article, Mussolini wrote "Down with the War. We remain neutral." He saw the war as an opportunity, both for his own ambitions as well as those of socialists and Italians. He was influenced by [[Anti-Austrian sentiment|anti-Austrian]] Italian nationalist sentiments, believing that the war offered Italians in Austria-Hungary the chance to liberate themselves from rule of the [[Hapsburg|Habsburgs]]. He eventually decided to declare support for the war by appealing to the need for socialists to overthrow the [[Hohenzollern]] and Habsburg monarchies in Germany and Austria-Hungary who he said had consistently repressed socialism.<ref name="Emile Ludwig 1969. p. 321">Emil Ludwig.

The ''Arditi'''s black uniform and use of the fez were adopted by Mussolini in the creation of his Fascist movement.]]

Mussolini further justified his position by denouncing the [[Central Powers]] for being [[reactionary]] powers; for pursuing [[Imperialism|imperialist]] designs against Belgium and Serbia as well as historically against Denmark, France, and against Italians, since hundreds of thousands of Italians were under Habsburg rule. He argued that the fall of Hohenzollern and Habsburg monarchies and the repression of "reactionary" Turkey would create conditions beneficial for the working class. While he was supportive of the Entente powers, Mussolini responded to the conservative nature of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] by stating that the mobilization required for the war would undermine Russia's reactionary authoritarianism and the war would bring Russia to social revolution. He said that for Italy the war would complete the process of ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'' by uniting the Italians in Austria-Hungary into Italy and by allowing the common people of Italy to be participating members of the Italian nation in what would be Italy's first national war. Thus he claimed that the vast social changes that the war could offer meant that it should be supported as a revolutionary war.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=189}}

As Mussolini's support for the intervention solidified, he came into conflict with socialists who opposed the war. He attacked the opponents of the war and claimed that those proletarians who supported [[pacifism]] were out of step with the proletarians who had joined the rising interventionist [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] that was preparing Italy for a revolutionary war. He began to criticize the Italian Socialist Party and socialism itself for having failed to recognize the national problems that had led to the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=191}} He was expelled from the party for his support of intervention.

The following excerpts are from a police report prepared by the Inspector-General of Public Security in Milan, G. Gasti, that describe his background and his position on the First World War that resulted in his ousting from the Italian Socialist Party. The Inspector General wrote:
{{bquote|Professor Benito Mussolini,&nbsp;... 38, revolutionary socialist, has a police record; elementary school teacher qualified to teach in secondary schools; former first secretary of the Chambers in Cesena, Forlì, and Ravenna; after 1912 editor of the newspaper ''Avanti!'' to which he gave a violent suggestive and intransigent orientation. In October 1914, finding himself in opposition to the directorate of the Italian Socialist party because he advocated a kind of active neutrality on the part of Italy in the War of the Nations against the party's tendency of absolute neutrality, he withdrew on the twentieth of that month from the directorate of ''Avanti!'' Then on the fifteenth of November [1914], thereafter, he initiated publication of the newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia'', in which he supported—in sharp contrast to ''Avanti!'' and amid bitter polemics against that newspaper and its chief backers—the thesis of Italian intervention in the war against the militarism of the Central Empires. For this reason he was accused of moral and political unworthiness and the party thereupon decided to expel him&nbsp;... Thereafter he&nbsp;... undertook a very active campaign in behalf of Italian intervention, participating in demonstrations in the piazzas and writing quite violent articles in Popolo d'Italia&nbsp;...<ref name="Mediterranean4" />}}

In his summary, the Inspector also noted:
{{bquote|He was the ideal editor of ''Avanti!'' for the Socialists. In that line of work he was greatly esteemed and beloved. Some of his former comrades and admirers still confess that there was no one who understood better how to interpret the spirit of the proletariat and there was no one who did not observe his apostasy with sorrow. This came about not for reasons of self-interest or money. He was a sincere and passionate advocate, first of vigilant and armed neutrality, and later of war; and he did not believe that he was compromising with his personal and political honesty by making use of every means—no matter where they came from or wherever he might obtain them—to pay for his newspaper, his program and his line of action. This was his initial line. It is difficult to say to what extent his socialist convictions (which he never either openly or privately abjure) may have been sacrificed in the course of the indispensable financial deals which were necessary for the continuation of the struggle in which he was engaged&nbsp;... But assuming these modifications did take place&nbsp;... he always wanted to give the appearance of still being a socialist, and he fooled himself into thinking that this was the case.<ref>''Mediterranean Fascism 1919–1945'' Edited by Charles F. Delzel, Harper Rowe 1970, p. 6.</ref>}}

=== Beginning of Fascism and service in World War I ===
[[File:Benito Mussolini 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=standing photo of Mussolini in 1917 as an Italian soldier|Mussolini as an Italian soldier, 1917]] <!-- this image box is on the right because on the left the Inspector General quotation two paragraphs down doesn't indent if it's on the left. -->
After being ousted by the Italian Socialist Party for his support of Italian intervention, Mussolini made a radical transformation, ending his support for [[class conflict]] and joining in support of [[Revolutionary nationalism#Benito Mussolini's revolutionary nationalism|revolutionary nationalism]] transcending class lines.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=191}} He formed the interventionist newspaper ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' and the ''Fascio Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista'' ("Revolutionary [[Fasci|Fasces]] for International Action") in October 1914.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=826}} His nationalist support of intervention enabled him to raise funds from [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies to create ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.<ref>Dennis Mack Smith. 1997. ''Modern Italy; A Political History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. p. 284.</ref> Further funding for Mussolini's Fascists during the war came from French sources, beginning in May 1915. A major source of this funding from France is believed to have been from French socialists who sent support to dissident socialists who wanted Italian intervention on France's side.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=200}}

On 5 December 1914, Mussolini denounced [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox socialism]] for failing to recognize that the war had made national identity and loyalty more significant than class distinction.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=191}} He fully demonstrated his transformation in a speech that acknowledged the nation as an entity, a notion he had rejected prior to the war, saying:
{{bquote|The nation has not disappeared. We used to believe that the concept was totally without substance. Instead we see the nation arise as a palpitating reality before us!&nbsp;... Class cannot destroy the nation. Class reveals itself as a collection of interests—but the nation is a history of sentiments, traditions, language, culture, and race. Class can become an integral part of the nation, but the one cannot eclipse the other.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=191–92}}<br />The class struggle is a vain formula, without effect and consequence wherever one finds a people that has not integrated itself into its proper linguistic and racial confines—where the national problem has not been definitely resolved. In such circumstances the class movement finds itself impaired by an inauspicious historic climate.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=192}}}}

Mussolini continued to promote the need of a revolutionary vanguard elite to lead society. He no longer advocated a proletarian vanguard, but instead a vanguard led by dynamic and revolutionary people of any social class.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=192}}
Though he denounced orthodox socialism and class conflict, he maintained at the time that he was a nationalist socialist and a supporter of the legacy of nationalist socialists in Italy's history, such as [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], and [[Carlo Pisacane]]. As for the Italian Socialist Party and its support of orthodox socialism, he claimed that his failure as a member of the party to revitalize and transform it to recognize the contemporary reality revealed the hopelessness of orthodox socialism as outdated and a failure.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=193}} This perception of the failure of orthodox socialism in the light of the outbreak of World War I was not solely held by Mussolini; other pro-interventionist Italian socialists such as [[Filippo Corridoni]] and [[Sergio Panunzio]] had also denounced classical [[Marxism]] in favor of intervention.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=195}}

[[File:Mussolini bersagliere.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Mussolini as a ''[[bersagliere]]'' during WWI]]

These basic political views and principles formed the basis of Mussolini's newly formed political movement, the ''Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria'' in 1914, who called themselves ''Fascisti'' (Fascists).{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=193, 195}} At this time, the Fascists did not have an integrated set of policies and the movement was small, ineffective in its attempts to hold mass meetings, and was regularly harassed by government authorities and orthodox socialists.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=195–96}} Antagonism between the interventionists, including the Fascists, versus the anti-interventionist orthodox socialists resulted in violence between the Fascists and socialists. The opposition and attacks by the anti-interventionist revolutionary socialists against the Fascists and other interventionists were so violent that even [[democratic socialist]]s who opposed the war such as [[Anna Kuliscioff]] said that the Italian Socialist Party had gone too far in a campaign of silencing the freedom of speech of supporters of the war. These early hostilities between the Fascists and the revolutionary socialists shaped Mussolini's conception of the nature of Fascism in its support of political violence.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=196}}

Mussolini became an ally with the [[Irredentism|irredentist]] politician and journalist [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]].<ref name="Mediterranean4"/> When World War I started, Mussolini, like many Italian nationalists, volunteered to fight. He was turned down because of his radical Socialism and told to wait for his reserve call up. He was called up on 31 August and reported for duty with his old unit, the ''Bersaglieri''.  After a two-week refresher course he was sent to Isonzo front where he took part in the Second Battle of the Isonzo, September 1915.  His unit also took part in the Third Battle of the Isonzo, October 1915.<ref name="Schindler2001">{{cite book |last1=Schindler |first1=John R. |title=Isonzo: the Forgotten Sacrifice of the Great War |date=2001 |publisher=Prager |location=Westport, Conn. |pages=88–89, 103, 200–201}}</ref>

The Inspector General continued:
{{bquote|He was promoted to the rank of corporal "for merit in war". The promotion was recommended because of his exemplary conduct and fighting quality, his mental calmness and lack of concern for discomfort, his zeal and regularity in carrying out his assignments, where he was always first in every task involving labor and fortitude.<ref name="Mediterranean4"/>}}

Mussolini would ultimately be wounded in action in February 1917, and was injured severely enough that he had to be evacuated from the front.<ref name="Schindler2001"/>

Mussolini's military experience is told in his work ''Diario di guerra''. Overall, he totaled about nine months of active, front-line trench warfare. During this time, he contracted [[paratyphoid fever]].<ref name="Kirkpatrick">''Mussolini: A Study in Power'', Ivone Kirkpatrick, Hawthorne Books, 1964. {{ISBN|0-8371-8400-2}}</ref> His military exploits ended in 1917 when he was wounded accidentally by the explosion of a mortar bomb in his trench. He was left with at least 40 shards of metal in his body.<ref name="Kirkpatrick"/> He was discharged from the hospital in August 1917 and resumed his editor-in-chief position at his new paper, ''Il Popolo d'Italia''. He wrote there positive articles about [[Czechoslovak Legions]] in Italy.

On 25 December 1915, in [[Treviglio]], he contracted a marriage with his fellow countrywoman Rachele Guidi, who had already borne him a daughter, Edda, at Forlì in 1910. In 1915, he had a son with [[Ida Dalser]], a woman born in Sopramonte, a village near Trento.<ref name="Grolier encyclopedia"/><ref name="Living History 2"/><ref name="timeswife">{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article411675.ece|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629125929/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article411675.ece|archivedate=29 June 2011|title=Power-mad Mussolini sacrificed wife and son|work=The Times|location=UK|date=13 January 2005|accessdate=14 May 2009|first=Richard|last=Owen}}</ref> He legally recognized this son on 11 January 1916.

By the time he returned from service in the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces of World War I, very little remained of Mussolini the socialist. Indeed, he was now convinced that socialism as a doctrine had largely been a failure. In 1917 Mussolini got his start in politics with the help of a £100 weekly wage (the equivalent of £6000 {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}}) from the British security service [[MI5]], to keep anti-war protestors at home and to publish pro-war propaganda.

The ideological basis for fascism came from a number of sources. Mussolini utilized works of [[Plato]], [[Georges Sorel]], [[Nietzsche]], and the economic ideas of [[Vilfredo Pareto]], to develop fascism. Mussolini admired Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', which he often read for inspiration.{{sfn|Moseley|2004|p=39}} ''The Republic'' expounded a number of ideas that fascism promoted, such as rule by an elite promoting the state as the ultimate end, opposition to democracy, protecting the class system and promoting class collaboration, rejection of egalitarianism, promoting the militarization of a nation by creating a class of warriors, demanding that citizens perform civic duties in the interest of the state, and utilizing state intervention in education to promote the development of warriors and future rulers of the state.<ref>Sharma, Urmila. Western Political Thought. Atlantic Publishers and Distributors (P) Ltd, 1998. p. 66.</ref> Plato was an idealist, focused on achieving justice and morality, while Mussolini and fascism were realist, focused on achieving political goals.<ref>Sharma, Urmila. Western Political Thought. Atlantic Publishers and Distributors (P) Ltd, 1998. pp. 66–67.</ref>

The idea behind Mussolini's foreign policy was that of ''[[spazio vitale]]'' (vital space), a concept in Fascism that was analogous to ''[[Lebensraum]]'' in German National Socialism.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|pp=48–51}} The concept of ''spazio vitale'' was first announced in 1919, when the entire [[Mediterranean]], especially so-called [[Julian March]], was redefined to make it appear a unified region that had belonged to Italy from the times of the [[Italia (Roman province)|ancient Roman province of Italia]],<ref name="Newman1943">{{cite book|author=Bernard Newman|title=The New Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTA34DxHx4AC&pg=PA307|year=1943|publisher=Books for Libraries Press|isbn=978-0-8369-2963-8|pages=307–|access-date=13 August 2015|archive-date=25 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025120942/https://books.google.com/books?id=gTA34DxHx4AC&pg=PA307|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="JonesÖstberg2007">{{cite book|author1=Harriet Jones|author2=Kjell Östberg|author3=Nico Randeraad|title=Contemporary history on trial: Europe since 1989 and the role of the expert historian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4h1nAAAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-7417-2|page=155|access-date=13 August 2015|archive-date=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927055130/https://books.google.com/books?id=4h1nAAAAMAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> and was claimed as Italy's exclusive sphere of influence. The right to colonize the neighboring [[Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947)|Slovene ethnic areas]] and the Mediterranean, being inhabited by what were alleged to be less developed peoples, was justified on the grounds that Italy was allegedly suffering from overpopulation.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|pp=50–51}}

Borrowing the idea first developed by [[Enrico Corradini]] before 1914 of the natural conflict between "[[plutocratic]]" nations like Britain and "proletarian" nations like Italy, Mussolini claimed that Italy's principal problem was that "plutocratic" countries like Britain were blocking Italy from achieving the necessary ''spazio vitale'' that would let the Italian economy grow.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|pp=48–50}} Mussolini equated a nation's potential for economic growth with territorial size, thus in his view the problem of poverty in Italy could only be solved by winning the necessary ''spazio vitale''.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=50}}

Though [[biological racism]] was less prominent in Fascism than in [[National Socialism]], right from the start the ''spazio vitale'' concept had a strong racist undercurrent. Mussolini asserted there was a "natural law" for stronger peoples to subject and dominate "inferior" peoples such as the "barbaric" Slavic peoples of Yugoslavia. He stated in a September 1920 speech: {{quote|When dealing with such a race as Slavic—inferior and barbarian—we must not pursue the carrot, but the stick policy&nbsp;...

While Italy occupied former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] areas between years 1918 and 1920, five hundred "Slav" societies (for example [[Sokol]]) and slightly smaller number of libraries ("reading rooms") had been forbidden, specifically so later with the Law on Associations (1925), the Law on Public Demonstrations (1926) and the Law on Public Order (1926)—the closure of the classical lyceum in Pazin, of the high school in Voloska (1918), and the five hundred Slovene and Croatian primary schools followed.<ref name="Sluga2001">{{cite book|author=Glenda Sluga|authorlink1=Glenda Sluga|title=The Problem of Trieste and the Italo-Yugoslav Border: Difference, Identity, and Sovereignty in Twentieth-Century Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1C0mJLFrpC0C|date=2001|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-4823-6|access-date=13 August 2015|archive-date=1 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101173250/https://books.google.com/books?id=1C0mJLFrpC0C|url-status=live}}</ref> One thousand "Slav" teachers were forcibly exiled to Sardinia and to [[Southern Italy]].

In the same way, Mussolini argued that Italy was right to follow an [[imperialist]] policy in Africa because he saw all black people as "inferior" to whites.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=52}} Mussolini claimed that the world was divided into a hierarchy of races (''stirpe'', though this was justified more on cultural than on biological grounds), and that history was nothing more than a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] struggle for power and territory between various "racial masses".{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=52}} Mussolini saw high birthrates in Africa and Asia as a threat to the "white race" and he often asked the rhetorical question "Are the blacks and yellows at the door?" to be followed up with "Yes, they are!". Mussolini believed that the United States was doomed as the American blacks had a higher birthrate than whites, making it inevitable that the blacks would take over the United States to drag it down to their level.<ref name="Strang, Bruce p. 21">Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 21.</ref> The very fact that Italy was suffering from overpopulation was seen as proving the cultural and spiritual vitality of the Italians, who were thus justified in seeking to colonize lands that Mussolini argued—on a historical basis—belonged to Italy anyway, which was the heir to the [[Roman Empire]]. In Mussolini's thinking, [[demography]] was destiny; nations with rising populations were nations destined to conquer; and nations with falling populations were decaying powers that deserved to die. Hence, the importance of [[natalism]] to Mussolini, since only by increasing the birth rate could Italy ensure that its future as a great power that would win its ''spazio vitale'' would be assured. By Mussolini's reckoning, the Italian population had to reach 60&nbsp;million to enable Italy to fight a major war—hence his relentless demands for Italian women to have more children in order to reach that number.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=52}}

=== March on Rome ===
{{Further|March on Rome}}
[[File:March on Rome.jpg|thumb|alt=Mussolini and the Quadrumviri during the March on Rome in 1922|Mussolini and the ''Quadrumviri'' during the [[March on Rome]] in 1922: from left to right: [[Michele Bianchi]], [[Emilio De Bono]], [[Italo Balbo]], and [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]]]]
In the night between 27 and 28 October 1922, about 30,000 Fascist blackshirts gathered in Rome to demand the resignation of liberal Prime Minister [[Luigi Facta]] and the appointment of a new Fascist government. On the morning of 28 October, [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]], who according to the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] held the supreme military power, refused the government request to declare [[martial law]], which led to Facta's resignation. The King then handed over power to Mussolini (who stayed in his headquarters in Milan during the talks) by asking him to form a new government. The King's controversial decision has been explained by historians as a combination of delusions and fears; Mussolini enjoyed wide support in the military and among the industrial and agrarian elites, while the King and the conservative establishment were afraid of a possible civil war and ultimately thought they could use Mussolini to restore law and order in the country, but failed to foresee the danger of a totalitarian evolution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyttelton|first=Adrian|title=The Seizure of Power: Fascism in Italy, 1919–1929|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-55394-0|pages=75–77}}</ref>

=== Appointment as Prime Minister ===
As Prime Minister, the first years of Mussolini's rule were characterized by a right-wing coalition government composed of Fascists, nationalists, liberals, and two Catholic clerics from the [[Italian People's Party (1919)|People's Party]]. The Fascists made up a small minority in his original governments. Mussolini's domestic goal was the eventual establishment of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state with himself as supreme leader (''[[Il Duce]]''), a message that was articulated by the Fascist newspaper ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'', which was now edited by Mussolini's brother, [[Arnaldo Mussolini|Arnaldo]]. To that end, Mussolini obtained from the legislature dictatorial powers for one year (legal under the Italian constitution of the time). He favored the complete restoration of state authority, with the integration of the [[Italian Fasces of Combat]] into the armed forces (the foundation in January 1923 of the [[Blackshirts|Voluntary Militia for National Security]]) and the progressive identification of the party with the state. In political and social economy, he passed legislation that favored the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes (privatizations, liberalizations of rent laws and dismantlement of the unions).<ref name="Living History 2" />

In 1923, Mussolini sent Italian forces to invade [[Corfu]] during the [[Corfu incident]]. In the end, the [[League of Nations]] proved powerless, and Greece was forced to comply with Italian demands.

=== Acerbo Law ===
[[File:Giacomo Matteotti crop.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Socialist leader Giacomo Matteotti headshot in suit and tie|Socialist leader [[Giacomo Matteotti]] was murdered a few days after he openly denounced fascist violence during the [[1924 Italian general election|1924 elections]].]]
In June 1923, the government passed the [[Acerbo Law]], which transformed Italy into a single national constituency. It also granted a two-thirds majority of the seats in Parliament to the party or group of parties that received at least 25% of the votes.<ref>{{cite document |author=Boffa, Federico |title=Italy and the Antitrust Law: an Efficient Delay? |date=1 February 2004

The ''national alliance'', consisting of Fascists, most of the old Liberals and others, won 64% of the vote.

=== Squadristi violence ===
The assassination of the socialist deputy [[Giacomo Matteotti]], who had requested that the elections be [[annulment|annulled]] because of the irregularities,<ref>[http://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Italia_-_30_maggio_1924,_Discorso_alla_Camera_dei_Deputati_di_denuncia_di_brogli_elettorali Speech of 30 May 1924] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217033833/http://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Italia_-_30_maggio_1924,_Discorso_alla_Camera_dei_Deputati_di_denuncia_di_brogli_elettorali |date=17 February 2010 }} the last speech of Matteotti, from it.wikisource</ref> provoked a momentary crisis in the Mussolini government. Mussolini ordered a cover-up, but witnesses saw the car that transported Matteotti's body parked outside Matteotti's residence, which linked [[Amerigo Dumini]] to the murder.

Mussolini later confessed that a few resolute men could have altered public opinion and started a coup that would have swept fascism away. Dumini was imprisoned for two years. On his release, Dumini allegedly told other people that Mussolini was responsible, for which he served further prison time.

The opposition parties responded weakly or were generally unresponsive. Many of the socialists, liberals, and moderates boycotted Parliament in the [[Aventine Secession (20th century)|Aventine Secession]], hoping to force Victor Emmanuel to dismiss Mussolini.

On 31 December 1924, [[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|MVSN]] consuls met with Mussolini and gave him an ultimatum: crush the opposition or they would do so without him. Fearing a revolt by his own militants, Mussolini decided to drop all pretense of democracy.<ref name="Paxton">{{Cite book |title=The Anatomy of Fascism |last=Paxton |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Paxton |year=2004 |publisher=Alfred A.

== Fascist Italy ==
=== Organizational innovations ===
German-American historian [[Konrad Jarausch]] has argued that Mussolini was responsible for an integrated suite of political innovations that made fascism a powerful force in Europe. First, he went beyond the vague promise of future national renewal, and proved the movement could actually seize power and operate a comprehensive government in a major country along fascist lines. Second, the movement claimed to represent the entire national community, not a fragment such as the working class or the aristocracy. He made a significant effort to include the previously alienated Catholic element. He defined public roles for the main sectors of the business community rather than allowing it to operate backstage. Third, he developed a cult of one-man leadership that focused media attention and national debate on his own personality. As a former journalist, Mussolini proved highly adept at exploiting all forms of mass media, including such new forms as motion pictures and radio. Fourth, he created a mass membership party, with free programs for young men, young women, and various other groups who could therefore be more readily mobilized and monitored. He shut down all alternative political formations and parties (but this step was not an innovation by any means). Like all dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition.<ref>Konrad Jarausch, ''Out of Ashes: A new history of Europe in the 20th century'' (2015) pp. 179–80</ref>

=== Police state ===
{{See also|Assassination attempts on Benito Mussolini}}
[[File:Benito Mussolini.gif|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini seated portrait in suit and tie facing left|Mussolini in his early years in power]]
Between 1925 and 1927, Mussolini progressively dismantled virtually all constitutional and conventional restraints on his power and built a [[police state]]. A law passed on 24 December 1925—Christmas Eve for the largely [[Roman Catholic]] country—changed Mussolini's formal title from "President of the Council of Ministers" to "Head of the Government", although he was still called "Prime Minister" by most non-Italian news sources. He was no longer responsible to Parliament and could be removed only by the King. While the [[Statuto Albertino|Italian constitution]] stated that ministers were responsible only to the sovereign, in practice it had become all but impossible to govern against the express will of Parliament. The Christmas Eve law ended this practice, and also made Mussolini the only person competent to determine the body's agenda. This law transformed Mussolini's government into a de facto legal dictatorship. Local autonomy was abolished, and [[podestà]]s appointed by the [[Italian Senate]] replaced elected mayors and councils.

On 7 April 1926, Mussolini survived a first assassination attempt by [[Violet Gibson]], an Irish woman and daughter of [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Lord Ashbourne]], who was deported after her arrest.<ref name=thetimesapr081926>The Times, Thursday, 8 April 1926; p. 12; Issue 44240; column A</ref> On 31 October 1926, 15-year-old [[Anteo Zamboni]] attempted to shoot Mussolini in Bologna.

All other parties were outlawed following Zamboni's assassination attempt in 1926, though in practice Italy had been a [[one-party state]] since 1925 (with either his January speech to the Chamber or the passage of the Christmas Eve law, depending on the source). In the same year, an electoral law abolished parliamentary elections. Instead, the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] selected a single list of candidates to be approved by [[Referendum|plebiscite]]. The Grand Council had been created five years earlier as a party body but was "constitutionalized" and became the highest constitutional authority in the state. On paper, the Grand Council had the power to recommend Mussolini's removal from office, and was thus theoretically the only check on his power. However, only Mussolini could summon the Grand Council and determine its agenda. To gain control of the South, especially [[Sicily]], he appointed [[Cesare Mori]] as a Prefect of the city of Palermo, with the charge of eradicating [[the Mafia]] at any price. In the telegram, Mussolini wrote to Mori:{{quote|Your Excellency has carte blanche; the authority of the State must absolutely, I repeat absolutely, be re-established in Sicily. If the laws still in force hinder you, this will be no problem, as we will draw up new laws.<ref>Arrigo Petacco, ''L'uomo della provvidenza: Mussolini, ascesa e caduta di un mito'', Milano, Mondadori, 2004, p. 190</ref>}}Mori did not hesitate to lay siege to towns, using torture, and holding women and children as hostages to oblige suspects to give themselves up. These harsh methods earned him the nickname of "Iron Prefect". In 1927, Mori's inquiries brought evidence of collusion between [[the Mafia]] and the Fascist establishment, and he was dismissed for length of service in 1929, at which time the number of murders in [[Palermo Province]] had decreased from 200 to 23. Mussolini nominated Mori as a senator, and fascist propaganda claimed that the Mafia had been defeated.<ref>Göran Hägg: ''Mussolini, en studie i makt''</ref>

[[1929 Italian general election|General elections]] were held in the form of a [[referendum]] on 24 March 1929. By this time, the country was a single-party state with the [[National Fascist Party]] (PNF) as the only legally permitted party. The list put forward was ultimately approved by 98.43% of voters.<ref>[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=it011929 Italy, 24 May 1929: Fascist single list] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629113043/https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=it011929 |date=29 June 2019 }} Direct Democracy {{in lang|de}}</ref>

=== Economic policy ===
{{Further|Economy of Italy under Fascism}}
{{Corporatism sidebar}}
Mussolini launched several public construction programs and government initiatives throughout Italy to combat economic setbacks or unemployment levels. His earliest (and one of the best known) was the ''Battle for Wheat'', by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them [[Littoria]] and [[Sabaudia]]) on land reclaimed by draining the [[Pontine Marshes]]. In [[Sardinia]], a model agricultural town was founded and named ''Mussolinia'', but has long since been renamed [[Arborea]]. This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would have been thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country. The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production away from other more economically viable crops. Landowners grew wheat on unsuitable soil using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high [[tariff]]s were imposed.<ref>Clark, Martin, ''Modern Italy'', Pearson Longman, 2008, p. 322</ref> The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government [[subsidy|subsidies]] given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.

[[File:Inaugurazione Littoria 001.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inaugurazione Littoria with massed parade in 1932|The inauguration of Littoria in 1932]]

Mussolini also initiated the "Battle for Land", a policy based on [[land reclamation]] outlined in 1928. The initiative had a mixed success; while projects such as the draining of the Pontine Marsh in 1935 for agriculture were good for propaganda purposes, provided work for the [[unemployment|unemployed]] and allowed for great land owners to control subsidies, other areas in the Battle for Land were not very successful. This program was inconsistent with the Battle for Wheat (small plots of land were inappropriately allocated for large-scale wheat production), and the Pontine Marsh was lost during World War II. Fewer than 10,000 [[peasant]]s resettled on the redistributed land, and [[peasant]] poverty remained high. The Battle for Land initiative was abandoned in 1940.

In 1930, in "[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]" he wrote, "The so-called crisis can only be settled by State action and within the orbit of the State."<ref>Mussolini, Benito, ''The Doctrine of Fascism'', CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1479216345}}, p. 21</ref> He tried to combat [[economic recession]] by introducing a "Gold for the Fatherland" initiative, encouraging the public to voluntarily donate [[gold jewelry]] to government officials in exchange for steel [[wristband]]s bearing the words "Gold for the Fatherland". Even [[Rachele Mussolini]] donated her wedding ring. The collected gold was melted down and turned into gold bars, which were then distributed to the [[national bank]]s.

Government control of business was part of Mussolini's policy planning. By 1935, he claimed that three-quarters of Italian businesses were under state control. Later that year, Mussolini issued several edicts to further control the economy, e.g. forcing banks, businesses, and private citizens to surrender all foreign-issued stock and bond holdings to the Bank of Italy. In 1936, he imposed [[price control]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Carl F.

In 1943, Mussolini proposed the theory of economic [[Fascist socialization|socialization]].

=== Railways ===
Mussolini was keen to take the credit for major public works in Italy, particularly the railway system.<ref name=Cathcart>{{cite news |last1=Cathcart |first1=Brian |title=Rear Window: Making Italy work: Did Mussolini really get the trains running on time? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rear-window-making-italy-work-did-mussolini-really-get-the-trains-running-on-time-1367688.html |accessdate=25 May 2019 |work=Independent |date=3 April 1994 |archive-date=6 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206045119/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rear-window-making-italy-work-did-mussolini-really-get-the-trains-running-on-time-1367688.html |url-status=live }}</ref> His reported overhauling of the railway network led to the popular saying, "Say what you like about Mussolini, he made the trains run on time."<ref name=Cathcart/> [[Kenneth Roberts (author)|Kenneth Roberts]], journalist and novelist, wrote in 1924:

=== Propaganda and cult of personality ===
{{Main|Italian Fascism}}
[[File:Duce Benito Mussolini.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait of Mussolini in 1930]]
Mussolini's foremost priority was the subjugation of the minds of the Italian people through the use of [[Propaganda of Fascist Italy|propaganda]]. The regime promoted a lavish [[Propaganda of Fascist Italy#Personality cult|cult of personality]] centered on the figure of Mussolini. He pretended to incarnate the new fascist [[Übermensch]], promoting an aesthetic of exasperated [[Machismo]] that attributed to him quasi-divine capacities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Falasca-Zamponi|first=Simonetta|title=Fascist spectacle : the aesthetics of power in Mussolini's Italy|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-22677-7|page=67|edition=1st pbk.}}</ref> At various times after 1922, Mussolini personally took over the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, colonies, corporations, defense, and public works. Sometimes he held as many as seven departments simultaneously, as well as the premiership. He was also head of the all-powerful Fascist Party and the armed local fascist militia, the [[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|MVSN]] or "Blackshirts", who terrorized incipient resistance in the cities and provinces. He would later form the [[OVRA]], an institutionalized [[secret police]] that carried official state support. In this way he succeeded in keeping power in his own hands and preventing the emergence of any rival.

Mussolini also portrayed himself as a valiant sportsman and a skilled musician. All teachers in schools and universities had to swear an oath to defend the fascist regime. Newspaper editors were all personally chosen by Mussolini, and only those in possession of a certificate of approval from the Fascist Party could practice journalism. These certificates were issued in secret; Mussolini thus skillfully created the illusion of a "free press". The trade unions were also deprived of any independence and were integrated into what was called the [[corporate state|"corporative" system]]. The aim, inspired by medieval [[guild]]s and never completely achieved, was to place all Italians in various professional organizations or ''corporations'', all under clandestine governmental control.

[[File:Benito Mussolini Roman Salute.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Benito Mussolini saluting crowd|From 1925, Mussolini styled himself ''[[Il Duce]]'' (the leader)]]
Large sums of money were spent on highly visible public works and on international prestige projects. These included as the [[Blue Riband]] ocean liner [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']]; setting aeronautical records with the world's fastest [[seaplane]], the [[Macchi M.C.72]]; and the transatlantic flying boat cruise of [[Italo Balbo]], which was greeted with much fanfare in the United States when it landed in Chicago in 1933.

The principles of the [[The Doctrine of Fascism|doctrine of Fascism]] were laid down in an article by eminent philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]] and Mussolini himself that appeared in 1932 in the ''[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]''. Mussolini always portrayed himself as an intellectual, and some historians agree.<ref>Bosworth, ''Mussolini '' pp. 58–59</ref> Gunther called him "easily the best educated and most sophisticated of the dictators", and the only national leader of 1940 who was an intellectual.{{r|gunther1940}} German historian [[Ernst Nolte]] said that "His command of contemporary philosophy and political literature was at least as great as that of any other contemporary European political leader."<ref>Ernst Nolte, ''Three Faces of Fascism: Action Française, Italian Fascism, National Socialism'' (1966) p. 200</ref>

[[File:Has seven 1 a.jpg|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini being cheered by Fascist Blackshirt youth in 1935|Benito Mussolini and Fascist [[Blackshirt]] youth in 1935]]
Nationalists in the years after World War I thought of themselves as combating the liberal and domineering institutions created by [[Prime Minister of Italy|cabinets]]—such as those of [[Giovanni Giolitti]], including traditional schooling. [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], a revolutionary [[cultural movement]] which would serve as a catalyst for Fascism, argued for "a school for physical courage and patriotism", as expressed by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] in 1919. Marinetti expressed his disdain for "the by now prehistoric and [[Technophobia|troglodyte]] [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] courses", arguing for their replacement with exercise modelled on those of the [[Arditi]] soldiers ("[learning] to advance on hands and knees in front of razing machine gun fire; to wait open-eyed for a crossbeam to move sideways over their heads etc."). It was in those years that the first Fascist youth wings were formed: [[Avanguardia Giovanile Fascista]] (Fascist Youth Vanguards) in 1919, and ''Gruppi Universitari Fascisti'' (Fascist University Groups) in 1922.

After the March on Rome that brought Mussolini to power, the Fascists started considering ways to politicize Italian society, with an accent on education. Mussolini assigned former [[Arditi|ardito]] and deputy-secretary for Education [[Renato Ricci]] the task of "reorganizing the youth from a moral and physical point of view." Ricci sought inspiration with [[Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of [[Scouting]], meeting with him in England, as well as with [[Bauhaus]] artists in Germany. The [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] was created through Mussolini's decree of 3 April 1926, and was led by Ricci for the following eleven years. It included children between the ages of 8 and 18, grouped as the Balilla and the Avanguardisti.

[[File:Benito Mussolini colored.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Colorized photograph of Mussolini wearing the [[commander-in-chief]] uniform]]
According to Mussolini: "Fascist education is moral, physical, social, and military: it aims to create a complete and harmoniously developed human, a fascist one according to our views". Mussolini structured this process taking in view the emotional side of childhood: "Childhood and adolescence alike&nbsp;... cannot be fed solely by concerts, theories, and abstract teaching. The truth we aim to teach them should appeal foremost to their fantasy, to their hearts, and only then to their minds".

The "educational value set through action and example" was to replace the established approaches. Fascism opposed its version of [[idealism]] to prevalent [[rationalism]], and used the Opera Nazionale Balilla to circumvent educational tradition by imposing the collective and hierarchy, as well as Mussolini's own [[Cult of personality|personality cult]].

Another important constituent of the Fascist cultural policy was [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1929, a concordat with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was signed, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the [[Papacy]] that dated back to the 1870 takeover of the [[Papal States]] by the [[House of Savoy]] during the [[unification of Italy]]. The [[Lateran treaties]], by which the Italian state was at last recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, and the independence of Vatican City was recognized by the Italian state, were so much appreciated by the ecclesiastic hierarchy that Pope [[Pius XI]] acclaimed Mussolini as "the Man of Providence".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fattorini|first=Emma|title=Hitler, Mussolini and the Vatican: Pope Pius XI and the speech that was never made|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-4488-2|page=xi|edition=[English edition]}}</ref>

The 1929 treaty included a legal provision whereby the Italian government would protect the honor and dignity of the Pope by prosecuting offenders.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN1944220320080919 Comic escapes prosecution for insulting pope (Oddly Enough) Reuters] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/619kAHcnL?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/09/19/us-comic-pope-idUSN1944220320080919 |date=23 August 2011 }}, (Friday 19 September 2008 1:15&nbsp;pm EDT) By Phil Stewart</ref> In 1927, Mussolini was re-[[baptism|baptized]] by a Roman Catholic priest. After 1929, Mussolini, with his anti-Communist doctrines, convinced many Catholics to actively support him.

=== Foreign policy ===
In foreign policy, Mussolini was pragmatic and opportunistic. At the center of his vision lay the dream to forge a new [[Roman Empire]] in Africa and the [[Balkans]], vindicating the so-called "[[mutilated victory]]" of 1918 imposed by the "plutodemocracies" (Britain and France) that betrayed the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and usurped the supposed "natural right" of Italy to achieve supremacy in the Mediterranean basin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burgwyn|first=H.

In the 1920s, Italy's foreign policy was based on the traditional idea of Italy maintaining "equidistant" stance from all the major powers in order to exercise "determinant weight", which by whatever power Italy chose to align with would decisively change the balance of power in Europe, and the price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe and Africa.<ref>Kallis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pp. 129 & 141</ref> In the meantime, since for Mussolini demography was destiny, he carried out relentless natalist policies designed to increase the birthrate; for example, in 1924 making advocating or giving information about contraception a criminal offense, and in 1926 ordering every Italian woman to double the number of children that they were willing to bear.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 27.</ref> For Mussolini, Italy's current population of 40&nbsp;million was insufficient to fight a major war, and he needed to increase the population to at least 60&nbsp;million Italians before he would be ready for war.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 26.</ref>

[[File:Mussolini truppe Etiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Mussolini inspecting troops during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]]]]
In his early years in power, Mussolini operated as a pragmatic statesman, trying to achieve some advantages, but never at the risk of war with Britain and France. An exception was the bombardment and occupation of [[Corfu]] in 1923, following an [[Corfu incident|incident]] in which Italian military personnel charged by the [[League of Nations]] to settle a boundary dispute between Greece and Albania were assassinated by bandits; the nationality of the bandits remains unclear. At the time of the Corfu incident, Mussolini was prepared to go to war with Britain, and only desperate pleading by the Italian Navy leadership, who argued that the Italian Navy was no match for the British Royal Navy, persuaded Mussolini to accept a diplomatic solution.<ref name="Sullivan pp. 178–203">Sullivan, Barry "More than meets the eye: the Ethiopian War and the Origins of the Second World War" pp. 178–203 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered A.J.P. Taylor and the Historians'', London: Routledge, 1999 p. 193.</ref> In a secret speech to the Italian military leadership in January 1925, Mussolini argued that Italy needed to win ''spazio vitale'', and as such his ultimate goal was to join "the two shores of the Mediterranean and of the Indian Ocean into a single Italian territory".<ref name="Sullivan pp. 178–203"/> Reflecting his obsession with demography, Mussolini went on to say that Italy did not at the present possess sufficient manpower to win a war against Britain or France, and that the time for war would come sometime in the mid-1930s, when Mussolini calculated the high Italian birth rate would finally give Italy the necessary numbers to win.<ref name="Sullivan pp. 178–203"/> Subsequently, Mussolini took part in the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925, that guaranteed the western borders of Germany as drawn in 1919. In 1929, Mussolini ordered his Army General Staff to begin planning for aggression against France and Yugoslavia.<ref name="Sullivan pp. 178–203"/> In July 1932, Mussolini sent a message to German Defense Minister General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], suggesting an anti-French Italo-German alliance, an offer Schleicher responded to favorably, albeit with the condition that Germany needed to rearm first.<ref name="Sullivan pp. 178–203"/> In late 1932–early 1933, Mussolini planned to launch a surprise attack against both France and Yugoslavia that was to begin in August 1933.<ref name="Sullivan pp. 178–203"/> Mussolini's planned war of 1933 was only stopped when he learned that the French ''[[Deuxième Bureau]]'' had broken the Italian military codes, and that the French, being forewarned of all the Italian plans, were well prepared for the Italian attack.<ref name="Sullivan pp. 178–203"/>

After [[Adolf Hitler]] came into power, threatening Italian interests in Austria and the Danube basin, Mussolini proposed the [[Four Power Pact]] with Britain, France and Germany in 1933. When the Austrian 'austro-fascist' Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss#Assassination|Engelbert Dollfuss]] with dictatorial power was assassinated on 25 July 1934 by National-Socialist supporters, Mussolini even threatened Germany with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria. Mussolini for a period of time continued strictly opposing any German attempt to obtain [[Anschluss]] and promoted the ephemeral [[Stresa Front]] against Germany in 1935.

Despite Mussolini's imprisonment for opposing the Italo-Turkish War in Africa as "nationalist [[delirium tremens]]" and "a miserable war of conquest",{{r|gunther1940}} after the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1935–1936, in the [[Second Italo–Ethiopian War]] Italy invaded [[Ethiopia]] following border incidents occasioned by Italian inclusions over the vaguely drawn border between Ethiopia and [[Italian Somaliland]]. Historians are still divided about the reasons for the attack on Ethiopia in 1935. Some Italian historians such as Franco Catalano and Giorgio Rochat argue that the invasion was an act of [[social imperialism]], contending that the [[Great Depression]] had badly damaged Mussolini's prestige, and that he needed a foreign war to distract public opinion.<ref name="Kallis, Aristotle p. 124">Kallis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 p. 124.</ref> Other historians such as Pietro Pastorelli have argued that the invasion was launched as part of an expansionist program to make Italy the main power in the Red Sea area and the Middle East.<ref name="Kallis, Aristotle p. 124"/> A middle way interpretation was offered by the American historian [[MacGregor Knox]], who argued that the war was started for both foreign and domestic reasons, being both a part of Mussolini's long-range expansionist plans and intended to give Mussolini a foreign policy triumph that would allow him to push the Fascist system in a more radical direction at home.<ref name="Kallis, Aristotle p. 124"/> Italy's forces were far superior to the Abyssinian forces, especially in air power, and they were soon victorious. Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] was forced to flee the country, with Italy entering the capital city, [[Addis Ababa]] to proclaim an empire by May 1936, making Ethiopia part of [[Italian East Africa]].<ref name="Red">{{Cite news|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/5RUHGM?OpenDocument&View=defaultBody&style=custo_print |publisher=icrc.org |title=Ethiopia 1935–36 |date=8 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201235400/http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/5RUHGM?OpenDocument&View=defaultBody&style=custo_print |archivedate=1 December 2006 }}</ref>

Confident of having been given [[Franco-Italian Agreement|free hand]] by French Premier [[Pierre Laval]], and certain that the British and French would be forgiving because of his opposition to Hitler's revisionism within the Stresa front, Mussolini received with disdain the League of Nations' economic sanctions imposed on Italy by initiative of London and Paris.<ref>Brecher, Michael and Jonathan Wilkenfeld.

The international mood was now against colonialist expansion and Italy's actions were condemned. Furthermore, Italy was criticized for its use of [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]] against its enemies and also for its zero tolerance approach to enemy guerrillas, authorized by Mussolini.<ref name="Red" /> Between 1936 and 1941 during operations to "pacify" Ethiopia, the Italians killed hundreds of thousands of Ethiopian civilians, and are estimated to have killed about 7% of Ethiopia's total population.<ref>Sullivan, Barry "More than meets the eye: the Ethiopian War and the Origins of the Second World War" pp. 178–203 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered: A.J.P.

Without a policy of ten eyes to one, we cannot heal this wound in good time".<ref name="Strang, Bruce p. 22">Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 22.</ref> Mussolini personally ordered Graziani to execute the entire male population over the age of 18 in one town and in one district ordered that "the prisoners, their accomplices and the uncertain will have to be executed" as part of the "gradual liquidation" of the population.<ref name="Strang, Bruce p. 22"/> Believing the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was inspiring Ethiopians to resist, Mussolini ordered that Orthodox priests and monks were to be targeted in revenge for guerrilla attacks.<ref name="Strang, Bruce p. 22"/> Mussolini brought in Degree Law 880, which made miscegenation a crime punishable with five years in prison as Mussolini made it absolutely clear that he did not want his soldiers and officials serving in Ethiopia to ever have sex with Ethiopian women under any circumstances as he believed that multiracial relationships made his men less likely to kill Ethiopians.<ref name="Strang, Bruce p. 22"/> Mussolini favored a policy of brutality partly because he believed the Ethiopians were not a nation because black people were too stupid to have a sense of nationality and therefore the guerrillas were just "bandits".<ref name="Strang, Bruce p. 23">Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 23.</ref> The other reason was because Mussolini was planning on bringing millions of Italian colonists into Ethiopia and he needed to kill off much of the Ethiopian population to make room for the Italian colonists just as he had done in Libya.<ref name="Strang, Bruce p. 23"/>

The sanctions against Italy were used by Mussolini as a pretext for an alliance with Germany. In January 1936, Mussolini told the German Ambassador [[Ulrich von Hassell]] that: "If Austria were in practice to become a German satellite, he would have no objection".<ref name="Cassels pp. 57–74">Cassels, Alan "Mussolini and the Myth of Rome" pp. 57–74 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered: A.J.P.

[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|alt=Mussolini and Hitler saluting troops|On 25 October 1936, an alliance was declared between Italy and Germany, which came to be known as the [[Rome-Berlin Axis]].]]
On 11 July 1936, an Austro-German treaty was signed under which Austria declared itself to be a "German state" whose foreign policy would always be aligned with Berlin, and allowed for pro-Nazis to enter the Austrian cabinet.<ref name="Cassels pp. 57–74"/> Mussolini had applied strong pressure on the Austrian Chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] to sign the treaty in order to improve his relations with Hitler.<ref name="Cassels pp. 57–74"/> After the sanctions against Italy ended in July 1936, the French tried hard to revive the [[Stresa Front]], displaying what Sullivan called "an almost humiliating determination to retain Italy as an ally".<ref name="ReferenceA">Sullivan, Barry "More than meets the eye: the Ethiopian War and the Origins of the Second World War" pp. 178–203 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered: A.J.P.

Taylor and the Historians'', London: Routledge, 1999 p. 65.</ref> In April 1938, Britain and Italy signed the [[Anglo-Italian Agreements of 1938|Easter Accords]] under which Britain promised to recognise Ethiopia as Italian in exchange for Italy pulling out of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The Foreign Office understood that it was the Spanish Civil War that was pulling Rome and Berlin closer together, and believed if Mussolini could be persuaded to disengage from Spain, then he would return to the Allied camp. To get Mussolini out of Spain, the British were prepared to pay such prices such as recognising King Victor Emmanuel III as Emperor of Ethiopia. The American historian Barry Sullivan wrote that both the British and the French very much wanted a [[rapprochement]] with Italy to undo the damage caused by the League of Nations sanctions, and that "Mussolini chose to ally with Hitler, rather than being forced…"<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Reflecting the new pro-German foreign policy on 25 October 1936, Mussolini agreed to form a [[Rome-Berlin Axis]], sanctioned by a cooperation agreement with [[Nazi Germany]] and signed in [[Berlin]]. Furthermore, the conquest of Ethiopia cost the lives of 12,000 Italians and another 4,000 to 5,000 Libyans, Eritreans, and Somalis fighting in Italian service.<ref name="ReferenceB">Sullivan, Barry "More than meets the eye: the Ethiopian War and the Origins of the Second World War" pp. 178–203 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered: A.J.P.

From 1936 through 1939, Mussolini provided huge amounts of military support to the [[Nationalist Spain|Nationalists]] in the Spanish Civil War. This active intervention on the side of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] further distanced Italy from France and Britain. As a result, Mussolini's relationship with Adolf Hitler became closer, and he chose to accept the [[Anschluss|German annexation of Austria]] in 1938, followed by the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|dismemberment of Czechoslovakia]] in 1939. In May 1938, during Hitler's visit to Italy, Mussolini told the ''Führer'' that Italy and France were deadly enemies fighting on "opposite sides of the barricade" concerning the Spanish Civil War, and the Stresa Front was "dead and buried".<ref>Sullivan, Barry "More than meets the eye: the Ethiopian War and the Origins of the Second World War" pp. 178–203 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered: A.J.P. Taylor and the Historians'', London: Routledge, 1999 p. 182.</ref> At the [[Munich Conference]] in September 1938, Mussolini continued to pose as a moderate working for European peace, while helping [[Nazi Germany]] annex the [[Sudetenland]]. The 1936 Axis agreement with Germany was strengthened by signing the [[Pact of Steel]] on 22 May 1939, that bound together Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany in a full military alliance.

Members of [[TIGR]], a Slovene anti-fascist group, plotted to kill Mussolini in [[Kobarid]] in 1938, but their attempt was unsuccessful.

By the late 1930s, Mussolini's obsession with demography led him to conclude that Britain and France were finished as powers, and that it was Germany and Italy who were destined to rule Europe if for no other reason than their demographic strength.{{sfn|Stang|1999|p=172}} Mussolini stated his belief that declining birth rates in France were "absolutely horrifying" and that the British Empire was doomed because one-quarter of the British population was over 50.{{sfn|Stang|1999|p=172}} As such, Mussolini believed that an alliance with Germany was preferable to an alignment with Britain and France as it was better to be allied with the strong instead of the weak.{{sfn|Stang|1999|pp=172–74}} Mussolini saw international relations as a Social Darwinian struggle between "virile" nations with high birth rates that were destined to destroy "effete" nations with low birth rates. Mussolini believed that France was a "weak and old" nation as the French weekly death rate exceeded the birthrate by 2,000, and he had no interest in an alliance with France.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 47.</ref>

Such was the extent of Mussolini's belief that it was Italy's ''destino'' to rule the Mediterranean because of Italy's high birth rate that he neglected much of the serious planning and preparations necessary for a war with the Western powers.<ref>Cassels, Alan "Mussolini and the Myth of Rome" pp. 57–74 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered A.J.P. Taylor and the Historians'' edited by Gordon Martel, London: Routledge, 1999 p. 64.</ref> The only arguments that held Mussolini back from full alignment with Berlin were his awareness of Italy's economic and military weakness, meaning he required further time to rearm, and his desire to use the [[Easter Pact|Easter Accords]] of April 1938 as a way of splitting Britain from France.{{sfn|Stang|1999|pp=173–74}} A military alliance with Germany as opposed to the already existing looser political alliance with the ''Reich'' under the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] (which had no military commitments) would end any chance of Britain implementing the Easter Accords.{{sfn|Stang|1999|pp=174–75}} The Easter Accords in turn were intended by Mussolini to allow Italy to take on France alone by sufficiently improving Anglo-Italian relations that London would presumably remain neutral in the event of a Franco-Italian war (Mussolini had imperial designs on Tunisia, and had some [[Tunisian Italians|support in that country]]<ref name="unification">{{Cite book| last =Lowe| first =CJ| title =Italian Foreign Policy 1870–1940| publisher =Routledge| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=5Cfuax6XHF0C&q=irredentism&pg=PA11| isbn =978-0-415-26597-3| year =1967| access-date =3 June 2020| archive-date =25 September 2020| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20200925055457/https://books.google.com/books?id=5Cfuax6XHF0C&pg=PA11&dq=irredentism| url-status =live}}</ref> ).{{sfn|Stang|1999|pp=174–75}} In turn, the Easter Accords were intended by Britain to win Italy away from Germany.

Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]], Mussolini's son-in-law and foreign minister, summed up the dictator's foreign policy objectives regarding France in an entry of his diary dated 8 November 1938: [[Djibouti]] would have to be ruled in common with France; "Tunisia, with a more or less similar regime; [[Corsica]], Italian and never Frenchified and therefore under our direct control, the border at the river [[Var (river)|Var]]."<ref>Galeazzo, Ciano, ''Diary, 1937–1943'', Enigma Books, 2008, 624 p., {{ISBN|978-1929631025}}, p. 154.</ref> As for [[Savoy]], which was not "historically or geographically Italian", Mussolini claimed that he was not interested in it. On 30 November 1938, Mussolini invited the French ambassador [[André François-Poncet]] to attend the opening of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, during which the assembled deputies, at his cue, began to demonstrate loudly against France, shouting that Italy should annex "Tunis, Nice, Corsica, Savoy!", which was followed by the deputies marching into the street carrying signs demanding that France turn over Tunisia, Savoy, and Corsica to Italy.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 200.</ref> The French premier, Édouard Daladier, promptly rejected the Italian demands for territorial concessions, and for much of the winter of 1938–39, France and Italy were on the verge of war.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 pp. 200–01.</ref>

In January 1939, the British prime minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]], visited Rome, during which visit Mussolini learned that though Britain very much wanted better relations with Italy, and was prepared to make concessions, it would not sever all ties with France for the sake of an improved Anglo-Italian relationship.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=153}} With that, Mussolini grew more interested in the German offer of a military alliance, which had first been made in May 1938.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=153}} In February 1939, Mussolini gave a speech before the Fascist Grand Council, during which he proclaimed his belief that a state's power is "proportional to its maritime position" and that Italy was a "prisoner in the Mediterranean and the more populous and powerful Italy becomes, the more it will suffer from its imprisonment. The bars of this prison are Corsica, Tunisia, Malta, Cyprus: the sentinels of this prison are Gibraltar and Suez".<ref>Cassels, Alan "Mussolini and the Myth of Rome" pp. 57–74 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered A.J.P.

The new course was not without its critics. On 21 March 1939 during a meeting of the Fascist Grand Council, [[Italo Balbo]] accused Mussolini of "licking Hitler's boots", blasted the Duce's pro-German foreign policy as leading Italy to disaster and noted that the "opening to Britain" still existed and it was not inevitable that Italy had to ally with Germany.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=97}} Though many ''gerarchi'' like Balbo were not keen on closer relations with Berlin, Mussolini's control of the foreign-policy machinery meant this dissidence counted for little.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=97}} Mussolini had a leading position within the Fascist Party, but he did not totally dominate it as Balbo's attack on Mussolini for "licking Hitler's boots" and his demand that the "opening to Britain" be pursued at the meeting of the Fascist Grand Council together with what the Greek historian Aristotle Kallis called Mussolini's "relatively restrained" response show—the Nazi Party had nothing equivalent to the Fascist Grand Council and it was inconceivable that one of Hitler's ''gauleiters'' would attack him in the same way that a ''gerarchi'' like Balbo criticized Mussolini.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=97}} In April 1939, Mussolini ordered the [[Italian invasion of Albania]]. Italy defeated [[Kingdom of Albania (1928–39)|Albania]] within just five days, forcing king [[Zog of Albania|Zog]] to flee and setting up a period of [[Albania under Italy]]. Until May 1939, the Axis had not been entirely official, but during that month the [[Pact of Steel]] treaty was signed outlining the "[[friendship]] and alliance" between Germany and Italy, signed by each of its foreign ministers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://astro.temple.edu/~rimmerma/Italo_German_alliance_1939.htm|publisher=astro.temple.edu|title=The Italo-German Alliance, May&nbsp;22, 1939|date=8 January 2008|access-date=5 April 2008|archive-date=20 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720055919/http://astro.temple.edu/~rimmerma/Italo_German_alliance_1939.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Pact of Steel was an offensive and defensive military alliance, though Mussolini had signed the treaty only after receiving a promise from the Germans that there would be no war for the next three years. Italy's [[King of Italy|King]] [[Victor Emanuel III]] was also wary of the pact, favoring the more [[Allies of World War I|traditional Italian allies]] like France, and fearful of the implications of an offensive military alliance, which in effect meant surrendering control over questions of war and peace to Hitler.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/victor_emmanuel_iii.jsp|publisher=Questia.com|title=Victor Emanuel III|date=8 January 2008|access-date=24 August 2017|archive-date=28 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628222207/http://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/victor_emmanuel_iii.jsp|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hitler was intent on invading Poland, though Ciano warned this would likely lead to war with the Allies.

Convinced that the war would soon be over, with a German victory looking likely at that point, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Accordingly, Italy declared war on Britain and France on 10 June 1940. Mussolini regarded the war against Britain and France as a life-or-death struggle between opposing ideologies—fascism and the "plutocratic and reactionary
democracies of the west"—describing the war as "the struggle of the fertile and young people against the sterile people moving to the sunset; it is the struggle between two centuries and two ideas", and as a "logical development of our Revolution".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalresources.org/2008/09/19/mussolini-speech-of-the-10-june-1940-declaration-of-war-on-france-and-england/|title=Mussolini: Speech of the 10 June 1940, Declaration of War on France and England|date=19 September 2008|access-date=10 May 2019|archive-date=22 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922170301/http://www.historicalresources.org/2008/09/19/mussolini-speech-of-the-10-june-1940-declaration-of-war-on-france-and-england/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 1940, the [[Tenth Army (Italy)|Italian Tenth Army]] was commanded by General [[Rodolfo Graziani]] and crossed from [[Italian Libya]] into [[Military history of Egypt during World War II|Egypt]], where British forces were located; this would become the [[Western Desert Campaign]]. Advances were successful, but the Italians stopped at [[Sidi Barrani]] waiting for [[Military logistics|logistic]] supplies to catch up. On 24 October 1940, Mussolini sent the [[Italian Air Corps]] to Belgium, where it took part in [[the Blitz]] until January 1941.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mollo|first=Andrew|title=The Armed Forces of World War II|publisher=I.B.

By early 1942, Italy's military position had become untenable. After the defeat at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] at the end of 1942, the Axis troops had to retreat to where they were finally defeated in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] in early 1943. Italy suffered major setbacks on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] as well. The [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] brought the war to the nation's very doorstep.{{sfn|Moseley|2004|p=}} The Italian home front was also in bad shape as the Allied bombings were taking their toll. Factories all over Italy were brought to a virtual standstill because [[raw materials]], such as coal and oil, were lacking. Additionally, there was a chronic shortage of food, and what food was available was being sold at nearly confiscatory prices. Mussolini's once-ubiquitous propaganda machine lost its grip on the people; a large number of Italians turned to [[Vatican Radio]] or [[BBC World Service|Radio London]] for more accurate news coverage.

Earlier in April 1943, Mussolini had persuaded Hitler to make a separate peace with Stalin and send German troops to the west to guard against an expected Allied invasion of Italy. Mussolini feared that with the losses in Tunisia and North Africa, the next logical step for Allied General [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s armies would be to come across the Mediterranean and attack the Italian peninsula. Within a few days of the Allied landings on Sicily in July 1943, it was obvious Mussolini's army was on the brink of collapse. This led Hitler to summon Mussolini to a meeting in [[Feltre]] on 19 July 1943. By this time, Mussolini was so shaken from stress that he could no longer stand Hitler's boasting.

By this point, some prominent members of Mussolini's government had turned against him. Among them were [[Dino Grandi|Grandi]] and Ciano. Several of his colleagues were close to revolt, and Mussolini was forced to summon the Grand Council on 24 July 1943. This was the first time the body had met since the start of the war. When he announced that the Germans were thinking of evacuating the south, Grandi launched a blistering attack on him.{{sfn|Moseley|2004|p=}} Grandi moved a resolution asking the king to resume his full constitutional powers—in effect, a [[vote of no confidence]] in Mussolini. This motion carried by a 19–8 margin.<ref name="fital"/> Mussolini showed little visible reaction, even though this effectively gave the king legal authorization to sack him. He did, however, ask Grandi to consider the possibility that this motion would spell the end of Fascism.<ref name=Payne/>

Despite this sharp rebuke, Mussolini showed up for work the next day as usual. He allegedly viewed the Grand Council as merely an advisory body and did not think the vote would have any substantive effect.<ref name="fital"/> That afternoon, he was summoned to the royal palace by Victor Emmanuel, who had been planning to oust Mussolini earlier. When Mussolini tried to tell the king about the meeting, Victor Emmanuel cut him off and formally dismissed him from office, replacing him with Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]].<ref name="fital"/> After Mussolini left the palace, he was arrested by [[Carabinieri]] on the king's orders.<ref name = "prisonrescue"/> By this time, discontent with Mussolini was so intense that when the news of his downfall was announced on the radio, there was no resistance of any sort. People rejoiced because they believed that the end of Mussolini also meant the end of the war.<ref name="fital"/>

In an effort to conceal his location from the Germans, Mussolini was moved around before being imprisoned at [[Campo Imperatore]], a mountain resort in [[Abruzzo]] where he was completely isolated. Badoglio kept up the appearance of loyalty to Germany, and announced that Italy would continue fighting on the side of the Axis. However, he dissolved the Fascist Party two days after taking over and began negotiating an [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Armistice]] with the Allies, which was signed on 3 September 1943. Its announcement five days later threw Italy into chaos; German troops rushed in to take over Italy in [[Operation Achse]]. As the Germans approached Rome, Badoglio and the king fled Rome, leaving the Italian Army without orders.<ref>Moseley(2004), p. 23</ref> After a period of anarchy, Italy finally declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] on 13 October 1943 from [[Malta]]; thousands of troops were supplied to fight against the Germans, while others refused to switch sides and had joined the Germans.

=== Italian Social Republic ("Salò Republic") ===
{{Main|Italian Social Republic}}

Only two months after Mussolini had been dismissed and arrested, he was rescued from his prison at the Hotel Campo Imperatore in the [[Gran Sasso raid]] on 12 September 1943 by a special [[Fallschirmjäger]] (paratroopers) unit and ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' [[commando]]s led by Major [[Harald Mors|Otto-Harald Mors]]; [[Otto Skorzeny]] was also present.<ref name="prisonrescue">{{Cite book|last=Annussek |first=Greg|title=Hitler's Raid to Save Mussolini|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81396-2|year=2005}}</ref> The rescue saved Mussolini from being turned over to the Allies in accordance with the armistice.<ref name="lastdays"/> Hitler had made plans to arrest the king, [[Umberto II of Italy|Crown Prince Umberto]], Badoglio, and the rest of the government and restore Mussolini to power in Rome, but the government's escape south likely foiled those plans.<ref name="RiseFall"/>

Three days following his rescue in the Gran Sasso raid, Mussolini was taken to Germany for a meeting with Hitler in [[Kętrzyn|Rastenburg]] at [[Wolfsschanze|his East Prussian headquarters]]. Despite public professions of support, Hitler was clearly shocked by Mussolini's disheveled and haggard appearance as well as his unwillingness to go after the men in Rome who overthrew him. Feeling that he had to do what he could to blunt the edges of Nazi repression, Mussolini agreed to set up a new regime, the [[Italian Social Republic]] ({{lang-it|Repubblica Sociale Italiana}}, RSI),{{sfn|Moseley|2004|p=}} informally known as the ''Salò Republic'' because of its administration from the town of [[Salò]] where he settled 11 days after his rescue by the Germans. Mussolini's new regime faced numerous territorial losses: in addition to losing the Italian lands held by the Allies and Badoglio's government, the provinces of [[South Tyrol|Bolzano]], [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]] and [[Trentino|Trento]] were placed under German administration in the [[Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills]], while the provinces of [[Friuli|Udine]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca|Gorizia]], [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]], [[Istria|Pola]] (now Pula), [[Rijeka|Fiume]] (now Rijeka), and [[Province of Ljubljana|Ljubljana]] (Lubiana in Italian) were incorporated into the German [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]].<ref name="Speer">{{cite book|last1=Speer|first1=Albert|title=Inside the Third Reich|date=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-1842127353|pages=420–21}}</ref><ref>A copy of an existing document is available online.

In addition, the German army occupied the [[Governorship of Dalmatia|Dalmatian provinces]] of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (Spalato) and [[Kotor]] (Cattaro), which were subsequently annexed by the [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatian fascist regime]]. Italy's gains in [[Axis occupation of Greece|Greece]] and [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939–1943)|Albania]] were also lost to Germany, with the exception of the [[Italian Aegean Islands]], which remained nominally under RSI rule.<ref>{{cite book|title=Salò-Berlino: l'alleanza difficile.

For about a year and a half, Mussolini lived in [[Gargnano]] on [[Lake Garda]] in [[Lombardy]]. Although he insisted in public that he was in full control, he knew that he was merely a [[puppet state|puppet ruler]] under the protection of his German liberators—for all intents and purposes, the ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of Lombardy.<ref name="RiseFall"/> Indeed, he lived under what amounted to house arrest by the SS, who restricted his communications and travel. He told one of his colleagues that being sent to a concentration camp was preferable to his puppet status.<ref name=Payne/>

After yielding to pressures from Hitler and the remaining loyal fascists who formed the government of the Republic of Salò, Mussolini helped orchestrate a series of executions of some of the fascist leaders who had betrayed him at the last meeting of the Fascist Grand Council. One of those executed was his son-in-law, [[Galeazzo Ciano]]. As head of state and Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Italian Social Republic, Mussolini used much of his time to write his memoirs. Along with his autobiographical writings of 1928, these writings would be combined and published by [[Da Capo Press]] as ''My Rise and Fall''. In an interview in January 1945 by Madeleine Mollier, a few months before he was captured and executed by Italian anti-fascist partisans, he stated flatly: "Seven years ago, I was an interesting person. Now, I am little more than a corpse." He continued:

{{bquote|Yes, madam, I am finished. My star has fallen. I have no fight left in me. I work and I try, yet know that all is but a farce... I await the end of the tragedy and—strangely detached from everything—I do not feel any more an actor.

On 25 April 1945, Allied troops were advancing into northern Italy, and the collapse of the Salò Republic was imminent. Mussolini and his mistress [[Clara Petacci]] set out for Switzerland, intending to board a plane and escape to Spain.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Klein|first1=Christopher|title=Mussolini's Final Hours, 70 Years Ago|url=http://www.history.com/news/mussolinis-final-hours-70-years-ago|website=History.com|accessdate=3 February 2017|date=28 April 2015|archive-date=6 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206041614/http://www.history.com/news/mussolinis-final-hours-70-years-ago|url-status=live}}</ref> Two days later on 27 April, they were stopped near the village of [[Dongo (CO)|Dongo]] ([[Lake Como]]) by communist partisans named Valerio and Bellini and identified by the [[Political Commissar]] of the partisans' 52nd ''Garibaldi'' Brigade, [[Urbano Lazzaro]]. During this time, Petacci's brother posed as a Spanish consul.<ref>Toland, John. (1966). ''The Last 100 Days'' Random House, p. 504, {{OCLC|294225}}</ref> After several unsuccessful attempts to take them to [[Como]] they were brought to [[Mezzegra]]. They spent their last night in the house of the De Maria family.

The next day, Mussolini and Petacci were both summarily shot, along with most of the members of their 15-man train, primarily ministers and officials of the [[Italian Social Republic]]. The shootings took place in the small village of [[Giulino di Mezzegra]] and were conducted by a partisan leader who used the [[nom de guerre]] Colonnello Valerio. His real identity is unknown, but conventionally he is thought to have been [[Walter Audisio]], who always claimed to have carried out the execution, though another partisan controversially alleged that Colonnello Valerio was [[Luigi Longo]], subsequently a leading communist politician in post-war Italy.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/28/guardianobituaries.italy |title= Urbano Lazzaro, The partisan who arrested Mussolini |first= John |last= Hooper |work= The Guardian |date= 28 February 2006 |accessdate= 24 October 2014 |archive-date= 21 September 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140921061531/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/28/guardianobituaries.italy |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804084,00.html |title= What Price Brutus? |work= Time Magazine |date= 7 April 1947 |accessdate= 24 October 2014 |archive-date= 28 August 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130828035808/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804084,00.html |url-status= live }}</ref> Mussolini was killed two days before Hitler and his wife [[Eva Braun]] committed suicide. The RSI only survived for another four days before Mussolini's defence minister, [[Rodolfo Graziani]]–the lone Italian marshal who remained loyal to Fascism after 1943–surrendered its remains on 1 May.

=== Mussolini's corpse ===
On 29 April 1945, the bodies of Mussolini, Petacci, and the other executed Fascists were loaded into a van and moved south to [[Milan]]. At 3:00&nbsp;a.m., the corpses were dumped on the ground in the old [[Piazzale Loreto]]. The piazza had been renamed "Piazza Quindici Martiri" (''Fifteen Martyrs' Square'') in honor of fifteen anti-Fascists recently executed there.<ref>[[Time Magazine]], 7 May 1945</ref>

[[File:Mussolini e Petacci a Piazzale Loreto, 1945.jpg|thumb|From left to right, the bodies of [[Nicola Bombacci|Bombacci]], Mussolini, [[Clara Petacci|Petacci]], [[Alessandro Pavolini|Pavolini]] and [[Achille Starace|Starace]] in [[Piazzale Loreto]], 1945.|alt=corpses hanging by feet including Mussolini next to Petacci at Piazzale Loreto, Milan, 1945]]
After being kicked and spat upon, the bodies were hung upside down from the roof of an [[Esso]] gas station.<ref>{{cite video | year =1945 | title =Video: Beaten Nazis Sign Historic Surrender, 1945/05/14 (1945) | url =https://archive.org/details/1945-05-14_Beaten_Nazis_Sign_Historic_Surrender | publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]] | accessdate =20 February 2012}}</ref> The bodies were then stoned from below by civilians. This was done both to discourage any Fascists from continuing the fight, and as an act of revenge for the hanging of many partisans in the same place by Axis authorities. The corpse of the deposed leader was subject to ridicule and abuse. Fascist loyalist [[Achille Starace]] was captured and sentenced to death and then taken to the Piazzale Loreto and shown the body of Mussolini. Starace, who once said of Mussolini "He is a god,"<ref>Quoted in "Mussolini: A New Life", p. 276 by Nicholas Burgess Farrell. 2004</ref> saluted what was left of his leader just before he was shot. The body of Starace was subsequently hung up next to that of Mussolini.

After his death and the display of his corpse in Milan, Mussolini was buried in an unmarked grave in the [[Cimitero Maggiore di Milano|Musocco]] cemetery, to the north of the city. On [[Easter Sunday]] 1946, his body was located and dug up by [[Domenico Leccisi]] and two other [[neo-fascism|neo-Fascists]].

On the loose for months—and a cause of great anxiety to the new Italian democracy—Mussolini's body was finally "recaptured" in August, hidden in a small trunk at the [[Certosa di Pavia]], just outside Milan. Two [[Franciscan Order|Fransciscan]] brothers were subsequently charged with concealing the corpse, though it was discovered on further investigation that it had been constantly on the move. Unsure what to do, the authorities held the remains in a kind of political limbo for ten years, before agreeing to allow them to be re-interred at [[Predappio]] in [[Romagna]], his birthplace. [[Adone Zoli]], the then-current prime minister, contacted [[Rachele Mussolini|Donna Rachele]], the dictator's widow, to tell her he was returning the remains, as he needed the support of the far-right in parliament, including Leccisi himself. In Predappio, the dictator was buried in a crypt (the only posthumous honor granted to Mussolini). His tomb is flanked by [[marble]] [[fasces]], and a large idealized marble [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of him is above the tomb.<ref>{{Find a Grave|11638}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Mussolini's first wife was [[Ida Dalser]], whom he married in [[Trento]] in 1914. The couple had a son the following year and named him Benito Albino Mussolini (1915–1942). In December 1915, Mussolini married [[Rachele Mussolini|Rachele Guidi]], who had been his mistress since 1910. Due to his upcoming political ascendency, the information about his first marriage was suppressed, and both his first wife and son were later persecuted.<ref name="timeswife"/> With Rachele, Mussolini had two daughters, [[Edda Mussolini|Edda]] (1910–1995) and Anna Maria (1929–1968), the latter of whom married in [[Ravenna]] on 11 June 1960 to Nando Pucci Negri; and three sons: [[Vittorio Mussolini|Vittorio]] (1916–1997), [[Bruno Mussolini|Bruno]] (1918–1941) and [[Romano Mussolini|Romano]] (1927–2006). Mussolini had several mistresses, among them [[Margherita Sarfatti]] and his final companion, [[Clara Petacci]]. Mussolini had many brief sexual encounters with female supporters, as reported by his biographer Nicholas Farrell.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Peter York|title=Dictator Style|publisher=Chronicle Books |location=San Francisco |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8118-5314-9|pages=17–18}}</ref>

Imprisonment may have been the cause of Mussolini's [[claustrophobia]]. He refused to enter the [[Blue Grotto (Capri)|Blue Grotto]] (a sea cave on the coast of [[Capri]]), and preferred large rooms like his {{convert|60|by|40|by|40|ft|m|abbr=in|order=flip}} office at the [[Palazzo Venezia]].<ref name="gunther1940">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n257/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper & Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | pages=236–37, 239–41, 243, 245–49}}</ref>

In addition to his native Italian, Mussolini spoke English, accented but fluent French and questionable German (his sense of pride meant he did not use a German interpreter). This was notable at the Munich Conference, as no other national leader spoke anything other than their native language; Mussolini was described as effectively being the "chief interpreter" at the Conference.<ref>Baigorri-Jalón, Jesús. From Paris to Nuremberg: The birth of conference interpreting. Vol. 111. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2014, pp.167-168</ref>

== Religious views ==
=== Atheism and anti-clericalism ===
Mussolini was raised by a devoutly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] mother<ref name="dmsmith_1">D.M. Smith 1982, p. 1</ref> and an [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] father.<ref name="dmsmith_8">D.M. Smith 1982, p. 8</ref> His mother Rosa had him [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church#Baptism|baptized]] into the Roman Catholic Church, and took her children to services every Sunday. His father never attended.<ref name="dmsmith_1"/> Mussolini regarded his time at a religious boarding school as punishment, compared the experience to hell, and "once refused to go to [[Mass (liturgy)|morning Mass]] and had to be dragged there by force."<ref name="dmsmith_2-3">D.M. Smith 1982, pp. 2–3</ref>

Mussolini became anti-clerical like his father. As a young man, he "proclaimed himself to be an [[Atheism|atheist]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-mussolini |title=9 Things You May Not Know About Mussolini |date=25 October 2012 |author=Jesse Greenspan |access-date=28 November 2015 |archive-date=18 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018122340/https://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-mussolini |url-status=live }}</ref> and several times tried to shock an audience by calling on God to strike him dead."<ref name="dmsmith_8"/> He believed that science had proven there was no god, and that the [[historical Jesus]] was ignorant and mad. He considered religion a disease of the psyche, and accused Christianity of promoting resignation and cowardice.<ref name="dmsmith_8"/> Mussolini was superstitious; after hearing of the [[curse of the Pharaohs]], he ordered the immediate removal from the [[Palazzo Chigi]] of an Egyptian mummy he had accepted as a gift.{{r|gunther1940}}

Mussolini was an admirer of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. According to [[Denis Mack Smith]], "In Nietzsche he found justification for his crusade against the Christian virtues of humility, resignation, charity, and goodness."<ref name="dmsmith_12">D.M. Smith 1982, p. 12</ref> He valued Nietzsche's concept of the [[Übermensch|superman]], "The supreme egoist who defied both God and the masses, who despised egalitarianism and democracy, who believed in the weakest going to the wall and pushing them if they did not go fast enough."<ref name="dmsmith_12"/> On his 60th birthday, Mussolini received a gift from Hitler of a complete twenty-four volume set of the works of Nietzsche.<ref>Peter Neville. ''Mussolini''. Oxon, UK; New York: Routledge, 2005. p. 176.</ref>

Mussolini made vitriolic attacks against Christianity and the Catholic Church, which he accompanied with provocative remarks about the consecrated host, and about a love affair between Christ and [[Mary Magdalene]]. He denounced socialists who were tolerant of religion, or who had their children baptized, and called for socialists who accepted religious marriage to be expelled from the party. He denounced the Catholic Church for "its [[authoritarianism]] and refusal to allow [[freedom of thought]]&nbsp;..." Mussolini's newspaper, ''La Lotta di Classe'', reportedly had an anti-Christian editorial stance.<ref name="dmsmith_15">D.M. Smith 1982, p. 15</ref>

=== Lateran Treaty ===
Despite making such attacks, Mussolini tried to win popular support by appeasing the Catholic majority in Italy. In 1924, Mussolini saw that three of his children were given [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church#Eucharist|communion]]. In 1925, he had a priest perform a [[Catholic marriage|religious marriage ceremony]] for himself and his wife Rachele, whom he had married in a [[civil ceremony]] 10 years earlier.<ref name="rmussolini_129">Rachele Mussolini 1974, p. 129</ref> On 11 February 1929, he signed a concordat and treaty with the Roman Catholic Church.<ref name="dmsmith_162-163"/> Under the [[Lateran Treaty|Lateran Pact]], Vatican City was granted independent statehood and placed under Church law—rather than Italian law—and the Catholic religion was recognized as Italy's [[state religion]].<ref name="Roberts">Roberts, Jeremy (2006). ''Benito Mussolini''. Minneapolis, MN: Twenty-First Century Books, p. 60.</ref> The Church also regained authority over marriage, Catholicism could be taught in all secondary schools, birth control and freemasonry were banned, and the clergy received subsidies from the state and was exempted from taxation.<ref name="Neville2004">{{cite book

In 1938 Mussolini began reasserting his anti-clericalism.

Although Mussolini had initially disregarded biological racism, he was a firm believer in national traits and made several generalizations about the Jews. Nevertheless, Mussolini considered Italian Jews to be Italians. Mussolini's antisemitic remarks in the late 1910s and early 1920s were more suited to the moment rather than a sincere belief in them. Mussolini blamed the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 on "Jewish vengeance" against Christianity with the remark "Race does not betray race ... Bolshevism is being defended by the international plutocracy. That is the real truth". Yet, within a few weeks, he contradicted himself with the remark "Bolshevism is not, as people believe, a Jewish phenomenon. The truth is that Bolshevism is leading to the utter ruin of the Jews of Eastern Europe".<ref name="Zimmerman2005">{{cite book|author=Joshua D.

In the early 1920s, Mussolini stated that Fascism would never raise a "[[Jewish Question]]" and in an article he wrote he stated "Italy knows no antisemitism and we believe that it will never know it," and then elaborated, "let us hope that Italian Jews will continue to be sensible enough so as not to give rise to antisemitism in the only country where it has never existed."<ref>Zimmerman, p. 62</ref> In 1932, Mussolini during a conversation with [[Emil Ludwig]] described antisemitism as a "German vice" and stated that "There was 'no Jewish Question' in Italy and could not be one in a country with a healthy system of government."<ref>Christopher Hibbert, Benito Mussolini (1975), p. 99</ref> On several occasions, Mussolini spoke positively about Jews and the [[Zionist movement]],<ref name="Zimmerman, p. 160">Zimmerman, p. 160</ref> although Fascism remained suspicious of Zionism after the Fascist Party gained power.<ref>Zimmerman, pp. 26–27</ref> In 1934, Mussolini supported the establishment of the [[Betar Naval Academy]] in [[Civitavecchia]] to train Zionist cadets under the direction of [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], arguing that a Jewish state would be in Italy's interest.<ref name="Kaplan, 2005, p. 154">Kaplan, 2005, p. 154.</ref> 
Until 1938 Mussolini had denied any antisemitism within the Fascist Party.<ref name="Zimmerman, p. 160"/>

The relationship between Mussolini and Adolf Hitler was a contentious one early on. While Hitler cited Mussolini as an influence and privately expressed great admiration for him,<ref>"If the Duce were to die, it would be a great misfortune for Italy. As I walked with him in the gardens of the [[Villa Borghese]], I could easily compare his profile with that of the Roman busts, and I realised he was one of the Caesars. There's no doubt at all that Mussolini is the heir of the great men of that period." ''[https://archive.org/stream/HitlersTableTalk#page/n15/mode/2up/search/caesars Hitler's Table Talk]''</ref> Mussolini had little regard for Hitler, especially after the Nazis had assassinated his friend and ally, [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], the [[Austrofascist]] dictator of Austria in 1934.

With the assassination of Dollfuss, Mussolini attempted to distance himself from Hitler by rejecting much of the racialism (particularly [[Nordicism]] and Germanicism) and antisemitism espoused by the German radical. Mussolini during this period rejected biological racism, at least in the Nazi sense, and instead emphasized "[[Italianization|Italianizing]]" the parts of the [[Italian Empire]] he had desired to build.<ref name="cultural" /> He declared that the ideas of [[eugenics]] and the racially charged concept of an [[Aryan]] nation were not possible.<ref name="cultural">{{cite journal|last1=Cannistraro|first1=P.V.|date=April 1972|title=Mussolini's Cultural Revolution: Fascist or Nationalist?|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=7|issue=3|pages=115–39|doi=10.1177/002200947200700308|s2cid=162125178}} {{subscription required}}

When discussing the Nazi decree that the German people must carry a passport with either Aryan or Jewish racial affiliation marked on it, in 1934, Mussolini wondered how they would designate membership in the "Germanic race":
{{bquote|But which race? Does there exist a German race? Has it ever existed? Will it ever exist? Reality, myth, or hoax of the theorists?<br />Ah well, we respond, a Germanic race does not exist.

When German-Jewish journalist Emil Ludwig asked about his views on race in 1933, Mussolini exclaimed:
{{bquote|Race! It is a feeling, not a reality: ninety-five percent, at least, is a feeling. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today.

Though Italian Fascism varied its official positions on race from the 1920s to 1934, ideologically Italian Fascism did not originally discriminate against the Italian-Jewish community: Mussolini recognised that a small contingent had lived there "since the days of the [[Kings of Rome]]" and should "remain undisturbed".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hollander |first=Ethan J |title=Italian Fascism and the Jews |publisher=University of California |url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~ejhollan/Haaretz%20-%20Ital%20fascism%20-%20English.PDF |isbn=978-0-8039-4648-4 |year=1997 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515202656/http://weber.ucsd.edu/~ejhollan/Haaretz%20-%20Ital%20fascism%20-%20English.PDF |archivedate=15 May 2008 }}</ref> There were even some Jews in the [[National Fascist Party]], such as [[Ettore Ovazza]], who in 1935 founded the Jewish Fascist paper ''La Nostra Bandiera'' ("Our Flag").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acjna.org/acjna/articles_detail.aspx?id=300 |title=The Italian Holocaust: The Story of an Assimilated Jewish Community |author=Peter Egill Brownfeld |date=Fall 2003 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |publisher=The American Council for Judaism |quote=Ovazza started a Jewish fascist newspaper, "La Nostra Bandiera" (Our Flag) in an effort to show that the Jews were among the regime's most loyal followers. |archive-date=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67tlUqxlm?url=http://www.acjna.org/acjna/articles_detail.aspx?id=300 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Corriere testata 1938.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Front page of the Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' on 11 November 1938: the fascist regime has approved the racial laws.]]
By mid-1938, the enormous influence Hitler now had over Mussolini became clear with the introduction of the ''[[Manifesto of Race]]''. The Manifesto, which was closely modeled on the Nazi [[Nuremberg Laws]],<ref name="Paxton" /> stripped Jews of their [[Italian citizenship]] and with it any position in the government or professions. The racial laws declared Italians to be part of the [[Aryan race]] and forbid sexual relations and marriages between Italians and those considered to be of an "inferior race", chiefly Jews and Africans.<ref name="Rodogno2006">{{cite book|author=Davide Rodogno|title=Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84515-1|page=65}}</ref> Jews were not permitted to own or manage companies involved in military production, or factories that employed over one hundred people or exceeded a certain value. They could not own land over a certain value, serve in the armed forces, employ non-Jewish domestics, or belong to the Fascist party. Their employment in banks, insurance companies, and public schools was forbidden.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zuccotti|first=Susan|title=Italians and the Holocaust|url=https://archive.org/details/italiansholocaus00susa|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=Basic Books Inc.|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/italiansholocaus00susa/page/36 36]}}</ref>

Even after the introduction of the [[Italian Racial Laws|racial laws]], Mussolini continued to make contradictory statements about race.<ref name="Zimmerman, p. 160"/> Many high government officials told Jewish representatives that the antisemitism in Fascist Italy would soon be over.<ref name="Zimmerman, p. 160"/> Antisemitism was unpopular within the Fascist party; once when a Fascist scholar protested to Mussolini about the treatment of his Jewish friends, Mussolini is reported to have said "I agree with you entirely. I don't believe a bit in the stupid anti-Semitic theory. I am carrying out my policy entirely for political reasons."<ref>Hibbert, p. 110</ref> Hitler felt disappointed with Mussolini's lack of antisemitism.<ref>Hibbert, p. 87</ref>

Mussolini and the Italian Army in occupied regions openly opposed German efforts to deport Italian Jews to Nazi concentration camps.<ref name=Kroener_Muller_Umbreit_p273>[[#KMU|Kroener, Muller, Umbreit]], p. 273</ref> Italy's refusal to comply with German demands of Jewish persecution influenced other countries.<ref name=Kroener_Muller_Umbreit_p273/>

In September 1943 semi-autonomous militarized squads of Fascist fanatics sprouted up throughout the Republic of Salò. These squads spread terror among Jews and anti-Fascists for a year and a half. In the power vacuum that existed during the first three or four months of the occupation, the semi-autonomous bands were virtually uncontrollable. Many were linked to individual high-ranking Fascist politicians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zuccotti|first=Susan|title=Italians and the Holocaust|url=https://archive.org/details/italiansholocaus00susa|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=Basic Books Inc|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/italiansholocaus00susa/page/148 148], 149}}</ref> Italian Fascists, sometimes government employees but more often fanatic civilians or paramilitary volunteers, hastened to curry favor with the Nazis.

It has been widely speculated that Mussolini adopted the Manifesto of Race in 1938 for merely tactical reasons, to strengthen Italy's relations with Germany. Mussolini and the Italian military did not consistently apply the laws adopted in the Manifesto of Race.<ref name=Kroener_Muller_Umbreit_p273/> In December 1943, Mussolini made a confession to journalist/politician Bruno Spampanato that seems to indicate that he regretted the Manifesto of Race:
{{bquote|The Racial Manifesto could have been avoided. It dealt with the scientific abstruseness of a few teachers and journalists, a conscientious German essay translated into bad Italian. It is far from what I have said, written and signed on the subject. I suggest that you consult the old issues of ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]''.

Mussolini also reached out to the Muslims in his empire and in the predominantly Arab countries of the Middle East. In 1937, the Muslims of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] presented Mussolini with the "Sword of Islam" while Fascist propaganda pronounced him as the "Protector of Islam."<ref>

Mussolini was survived by his wife, [[Rachele Mussolini]], two sons, Vittorio and [[Romano Mussolini]], and his daughters [[Edda Mussolini|Edda]] (the widow of Count Ciano) and Anna Maria. A third son, Bruno, was killed in an air accident while flying a [[Piaggio P.108|Piaggio P.108 bomber]] on a test mission, on 7 August 1941. His oldest son, [[Benito Albino Mussolini]], from his marriage with Ida Dalser, was ordered to stop declaring that Mussolini was his father and in 1935 forcibly committed to an asylum in Milan, where he was murdered on 26 August 1942 after repeated coma-inducing injections.<ref name="timeswife"/> [[Alessandra Mussolini]], daughter of [[Romano Mussolini]], Benito Mussolini's fourth son, and of Anna Maria Scicolone, [[Sophia Loren]]'s sister, has been a member of the [[European Parliament]] for the far-right [[Alternativa Sociale|Social Alternative]] movement, a deputy in the Italian lower chamber and served in the [[Italian Senate|Senate]] as a member of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] party.

=== Neo-fascism ===
Although the [[National Fascist Party]] was outlawed by the postwar [[Constitution of Italy]], a number of successor neo-fascist parties emerged to carry on its legacy. Historically, the largest neo-fascist party was the [[Italian Social Movement]] (''Movimento Sociale Italiano''), which disbanded in 1995 and was replaced by [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]], a conservative party that distanced itself from Fascism (its founder, former foreign minister [[Gianfranco Fini]], declared during an official visit to [[Israel]] that Fascism was "an absolute evil").<ref>{{cite news|title=Former fascists seek respectability|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2269141|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Economist|date=4 December 2003|archive-date=7 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107123214/http://www.economist.com/node/2269141|url-status=live}}</ref> National Alliance and a number of neo-fascist parties were merged in 2009 to create the short-lived [[The People of Freedom|People of Freedom]] party led by then Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], which eventually disbanded after the defeat in the [[2013 Italian general election|2013 general election]].

{{quote|Benito Mussolini, with a surfeit of bad history decaying in his imagination, could not see the plain realities before him. Like most of his generation he dramatised human affairs in incurably geographical patches, and like most of the masterful men of his time his belief in his power to mould the life about him carried him beyond sanity. From the beginning his was an ill-balanced temperament; he would be blatant at one moment, and weeping at another. He beat at the knees of Mother Reality like an unteachable child. He wanted war and conquest, triumph over definable enemies, fierce alliances, and unforgettable antagonisms. He wanted glory. He died, as his last words testify, completely unaware of the fact that the rational treatment of human affairs does not admit of that bilaterality which the traditions of warfare require. "Do we win?" he said.

He persuaded himself and he persuaded great multitudes of people that two great systems of ideas faced each other in the world, "Leftism" and "Rightism", and that he and his associated Dictators embodied the latter. He did contrive finally to impose the illusion of a definitive World War upon great masses of people.}}
