'''Liberia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Liberia.ogg|l|aɪ|ˈ|b|ɪər|i|ə}}), officially the '''Republic of Liberia''', is a country on the [[West Africa]]n coast. It is bordered by [[Sierra Leone]] to [[Liberia–Sierra Leone border|its northwest]], [[Guinea]] to [[Guinea–Liberia border|its north]], [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]] to [[Ivory Coast–Liberia border|its east]], and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to its south-southwest. It has a population of around 5 million and covers an area of {{convert|111369|km2|sp=us}}. [[English language|English]] is the official language, but over 20 indigenous languages [[Languages of Liberia|are spoken]], representing the numerous ethnic groups who make up more than 95% of the population. The country's capital and largest [[List of cities in Liberia|city]] is [[Monrovia]].

Liberia began as a settlement of the [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS), who believed black people would face better chances for freedom and prosperity in [[Africa]] than in the [[United States]].<ref name="AFP" /> The country declared its independence on July 26, 1847. The U.S. did not [[Diplomatic recognition|recognize]] Liberia's independence until February 5, 1862, during the [[American Civil War]]. Between January 7, 1822, and the American Civil War, more than 15,000 freed and free-born black people who faced legislated limits in the U.S., and 3,198 [[Afro-Caribbeans]], were relocated to the settlement.<ref name="TDIH" /> The settlers carried their culture and tradition with them. The Liberian constitution and flag were modeled after those of the U.S. On January 3, 1848, [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], a wealthy, free-born African American from [[Virginia]] who settled in Liberia, was elected Liberia's first [[President of Liberia|president]] after the people proclaimed independence.<ref name="TDIH">[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/liberian-independence-proclaimed "July 26, 1847 Liberian independence proclaimed"], This Day In History, History website.</ref>

Liberia was the first African republic to proclaim its independence, and is Africa's first and oldest modern republic. It retained its independence during the [[Scramble for Africa]]. During [[World War II]], Liberia supported the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States war effort]] against [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and in turn, the U.S. invested in considerable infrastructure in Liberia to help its war effort, which also aided the country in modernizing and improving its major air transportation facilities. In addition, President [[William Tubman]] encouraged economic changes. Internationally, Liberia was a founding member of the [[League of Nations]], [[United Nations]], and the [[Organisation of African Unity]].

The Americo-Liberian settlers did not relate well to the indigenous peoples they encountered, especially those in communities of the more isolated "[[the bush|bush]]". The colonial settlements were raided by the [[Kru people|Kru]] and [[Grebo people|Grebo]] from their inland chiefdoms. Americo-Liberians developed as a small elite that held on to political power,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/liberiacountryst00nels/page/22/mode/1up Nelson, H.D., ''Liberia, a country study'', 3rd ed., U.S.A.: The American University, 1985, pp. 25–27]</ref> and indigenous tribesmen were excluded from birthright citizenship in their own land until 1904, in an echo of the United States' treatment of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref name="Constitutional History">{{cite news |title=Constitutional history of Liberia |url=http://constitutionnet.org/country/liberia |access-date=July 1, 2020 |website=Constitutionnet.org}}</ref> Americo-Liberians promoted religious organizations to set up missions and schools to educate the indigenous peoples.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/liberiacountryst00nels/page/22/mode/1up Nelson, H.D., 1985, p. 22]</ref>

In 1980 political tensions from the rule of [[William R. Tolbert]] resulted in a military [[Coup d'état|coup]] during which Tolbert was killed, marking the beginning of years-long political instability. Five years of military rule by the [[People's Redemption Council]] and five years of civilian rule by the [[National Democratic Party of Liberia]] were followed by the [[First Liberian Civil War|First]] and [[Second Liberian Civil War]]s. These resulted in the deaths of 250,000 people (about 8% of the population) and the displacement of many more, and shrank [[Economy of Liberia|Liberia's economy]] by 90%.<ref name="veconomist" >{{cite news|title=Praise for the woman who put Liberia back on its feet|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21730015-ellen-johnson-sirleaf-has-not-been-perfect-president-she-has-been-good-enough-praise|work=[[The Economist]]|date=October 5, 2017}}</ref> A [[Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement|peace agreement in 2003]] led to democratic elections in [[Liberian general election, 2005|2005]], in which [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] was elected president, making history as the first female president in the continent.

==History==
{{main|History of Liberia}}
Undated [[Acheulean]] artifacts are abundant across [[West Africa]], attesting to the presence of ancient humans. The emerging [[chronometric dating|chronometric record]] of the [[Middle Stone Age]] (MSA) indicates that [[lithic core|core]] and [[flake tool|flake]] technologies have been present in West Africa since at least the [[Middle Pleistocene]] (~780-126 thousand years ago or ka), and that they persisted until the [[Late Pleistocene|Terminal Pleistocene]]/[[Holocene]] boundary (~12ka)—the youngest examples of such technology anywhere in Africa. The presence of MSA populations in forests remains an open question, however technological differences may correlate with various [[Afrotropical realm|ecological zones]]. [[Later Stone Age]] (LSA) populations evidence significant technological diversification, including both [[microlithic]] and [[Stone tool#Neolithic industries|macrolithic]] traditions.<ref name="Scerri">{{cite journal |last1=Eleanor |first1=Scerri |date=1986 |title=T Certificate history of Nigeria |url=https://www.africabib.org/s/rec.php?RID=406720584 |journal=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.137 |access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref>

The presence of [[Oldowan|Oldowan Earlier Stone Age]] (ESA) artefacts in West Africa has been confirmed by [[Michael Omolewa]].<ref name="Omolewa">{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Omolewa |date=1986 |title= Certificate history of Nigeria |url=https://www.africabib.org/s/rec.php?RID=406720584 |publisher=Longman |isbn=9780582585188}}</ref> [[Acheulean]] ESA artefacts are well documented across West Africa. None are currently dated. There are few dated [[Middle Stone Age]] (MSA) sites; they range from the [[Middle Pleistocene]] in northern, open [[Sahelian]] zones to the [[Late Pleistocene]] in both northern and southern zones of West Africa. The record shows that [[aceramic]] and [[ceramic]] [[Later Stone Age]] (LSA) assemblages in West Africa are found to  overlap chronologically, and that changing densities of [[microlith|microlithic industries]] from the coast to the north are geographically structured. These features may represent social networks or some form of cultural diffusion allied to changing ecological conditions.<ref name="Scerri" />

[[microlith|Microlithic industries]] with [[ceramics]] became common by the [[Northgrippian|Mid-Holocene]], coupled with an apparent intensification of wild food exploitation. Between ~4–3.5ka, these societies gradually transformed into food producers, possibly through contact with northern pastoralists and agriculturalists, as the environment became more arid.  However, hunter-gatherers have survived in the more forested parts of West Africa until much later, attesting to the strength of ecological boundaries in this region.<ref name="Scerri" />

The [[Pepper Coast]], also known as the Grain Coast, has been inhabited by indigenous peoples of Africa at least as far back as the 12th century. [[Mande peoples|Mande]]-speaking people expanded westward from the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]], forcing many smaller ethnic groups southward toward the Atlantic Ocean.

This influx of these groups was compounded by the decline of the Western Sudanic [[Mali Empire]] in 1375 and the [[Songhai Empire]] in 1591. As inland regions underwent [[desertification]], inhabitants moved to the wetter coast. These new inhabitants brought skills such as cotton [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], cloth [[weaving]], iron [[smelting]], [[rice]] and [[sorghum]] cultivation, and social and political institutions from the Mali and Songhai empires.<ref name=introprof /> Shortly after the [[Mane, Malian Soldiers|Mane]] conquered the region, the [[Vai (ethnic group)|Vai people]] of the former Mali Empire immigrated into the [[Grand Cape Mount County]] region. The ethnic Kru opposed the influx of Vai, forming an alliance with the Mane to stop further influx of Vai.<ref>{{cite book

People along the coast built [[canoe]]s and traded with other West Africans from [[Cap-Vert]] to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]. Arab traders entered the region from the north, and a long-established slave trade took captives to north and east Africa.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===Early colonization===
Between 1461 and the late 17th century, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and [[British people|British]] traders had contacts and trading posts in the region. The Portuguese named the area ''Costa da Pimenta'' ("Pepper Coast") but it later came to be known as the [[Grain Coast]], due to the abundance of [[melegueta pepper]] grains. European traders would barter commodities and goods with local people.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In the United States there was a movement to settle [[African Americans|free people of color]], both free-born and formerly enslaved, in Africa. This was because they faced racial discrimination in the form of political disenfranchisement and the denial of civil, religious, and social rights.<ref>Howard Brotz, ed., African American Social & Political Thought 1850–1920 (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1996), 38–39.</ref> Formed in 1816, the [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) was made up mostly of [[Quakers]] and slaveholders.

In 1822, the American Colonization Society began sending free people of color to the Pepper Coast voluntarily to establish a colony.

[[File:Mitchell Map Liberia colony 1839.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of Liberia Colony in the 1830s, created by the ACS, and also showing Mississippi Colony and other state-sponsored colonies.]]
The ACS, supported by prominent American politicians such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Henry Clay]], and [[James Monroe]], believed "repatriation" was preferable to having emancipated slaves remain in the United States.<ref name="Sale"/> Similar state-based organizations established colonies in [[Mississippi-in-Africa]], [[Kentucky in Africa]], and the [[Republic of Maryland]], which Liberia later annexed. However, Lincoln in 1862 described Liberia as only "in a certain sense...a success", and proposed instead that free people of color be assisted to emigrate to [[Chiriquí province|Chiriquí]], today part of Panama.<ref>{{Cite book

The Americo-Liberian settlers did not relate well to the indigenous peoples they encountered, especially those in communities of the more isolated "[[the bush|bush]]". They knew nothing of their cultures, languages, or animist religion, and were not interested in learning. The colonial settlements were raided by the [[Kru people|Kru]] and [[Grebo people|Grebo]] from their inland chiefdoms. Encounters with tribal Africans in the bush often became violent confrontations.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In ''Slaves to Racism: An Unbroken Chain from America to Liberia'', Benjamin Dennis and Anita Dennis argue that the Americo-Liberians replicated the only society most of them knew: the racist culture of the American South. Believing themselves different from and culturally and educationally superior to the indigenous peoples, the Americo-Liberians developed as an elite minority that held on to political power. They treated the natives the way American whites had treated them: as inferiors. The natives could not vote and could not speak unless spoken to. Just as people of color were prohibited from marrying white people in most of the United States, the indigenous Africans could not by law marry Americo-Liberians. Even when some indigenous Africans became educated in Western ways, they were broadly excluded from government positions.<ref>{{cite web

The leadership of the new nation consisted largely of the [[Americo-Liberians]], who initially established political and economic dominance in the coastal areas that the ACS had purchased; they maintained relations with U.S. contacts in developing these areas and the resulting trade. Their passage of the 1865 Ports of Entry Act prohibited foreign commerce with the inland tribes, ostensibly to "encourage the growth of civilized values" before such trade was allowed in the region.<ref name=volume/> <!--How? -->

{{main|Liberia in World War I}}

Liberia remained neutral during [[World War I]] until August 4, 1917, when it declared war on Germany. In 1919 Liberia attended the [[Versailles Peace Conference]]. Liberia was one of the founding members of the [[League of Nations]] when it was founded in January 1920.<ref name="Heffinck">{{cite web |last1=Heffinck |first1=Ariane |title=Liberia: A Nation in Recovery |url=https://una-gp.org/2014/02/17/liberia-a-nation-in-recovery/ |website=una-gp.org |publisher=United Nations Association of Philadelphia |access-date=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107000113/https://una-gp.org/2014/02/17/liberia-a-nation-in-recovery/ |archive-date=November 7, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Middle 20th century===
In 1929 allegations of [[modern slavery]] in Liberia led the [[League of Nations]] to establish the [[Cuthbert Christy#Christy commission|Christy commission]]. Findings included government involvement in widespread "Forced or compulsory labour". Minority ethnic groups especially were exploited in a system that enriched well-connected elites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Christy|first=Cuthbert|date=15 December 1930|title=COMMISSION'S REPORT: INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY IN LIBERIA|url=http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/Dateien/CouncilMSD/C-658-M-272-1930-VI_EN.pdf|journal=League of Nations|pages=127|access-date=October 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412091820/https://biblio-archive.unog.ch/Dateien/CouncilMSD/C-658-M-272-1930-VI_EN.pdf|archive-date=April 12, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>  As a result of the report, President [[Charles D.

In the mid-20th century Liberia gradually began to modernize with American assistance. During [[World War II]] the United States made major infrastructure improvements to support its military efforts in Africa and Europe against Germany. It built the [[Freeport of Monrovia]] and [[Roberts International Airport]] under the [[Lend-Lease]] program before its entry into the Second World War.<ref name="opendoor">{{cite journal |last1=Marinelli |first1=Lawrence |year=1964 |title=Liberia's Open Door Policy |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=91–98 |doi=10.1017/s0022278x00003694}}</ref>

After the war President [[William Tubman]] encouraged foreign investment in the country. Liberia had the second-highest rate of economic growth in the world during the 1950s.<ref name=opendoor/>

Liberia also began to take a more active role in international affairs. It was a founding member of the [[United Nations]] in 1945 and became a vocal critic of the [[South Africa]]n [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid regime]].<ref>

[[File:Topographic map of Liberia-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|A map of Liberia]]
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map LBR present.svg|thumb|Liberia map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Liberia is situated in [[West Africa]], bordering the North Atlantic Ocean to the country's southwest. It lies between latitudes [[4th parallel north|4°]] and [[9th parallel north|9°N]], and longitudes [[7th meridian west|7°]] and [[12th meridian west|12°W]].

The landscape is characterized by mostly flat to rolling coastal plains that contain [[mangrove]]s and [[swamp]]s, which rise to a rolling plateau and low mountains in the northeast.<ref name="eowg">{{cite book|last=Bateman|first=Graham|author2=Victoria Egan |author3=Fiona Gold |author4=Philip Gardner |title=Encyclopedia of World Geography|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=New York|year=2000|page=161|isbn=1-56619-291-9}}</ref>

Tropical [[rainforest]]s cover the hills, while elephant grass and [[semi-deciduous]] forests make up the dominant vegetation in the northern sections.<ref name="eowg"/> The equatorial climate, in the south of the country, is hot year-round with heavy rainfall from May to October with a short interlude in mid-July to August.<ref name="eowg"/> During the winter months of November to March, dry dust-laden [[harmattan]] winds blow inland, causing many problems for residents.<ref name="eowg"/>

Liberia's watershed tends to move in a southwestern pattern towards the sea as new rains move down the forested plateau off the inland mountain range of [[Guinée Forestière]], in [[Guinea]]. [[Grand Cape Mount County|Cape Mount]] near the border with [[Sierra Leone]] receives the most precipitation in the nation.<ref name="eowg"/>

Liberia's main northwestern boundary is traversed by the Mano River while its southeast limits are bounded by the [[Cavalla River]].<ref name="eowg"/> Liberia's three largest rivers are [[Saint Paul River|St. Paul]] exiting near [[Monrovia]], the river [[Saint John River (Liberia)|St. John]] at [[Buchanan, Liberia|Buchanan]], and the [[Cestos River]], all of which flow into the Atlantic. The Cavalla is the longest river in the nation at {{convert|515|km|mi|sp=us}}.<ref name="eowg"/>

The highest point wholly within Liberia is [[Mount Wuteve]] at {{convert|1440|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in the northwestern Liberia range of the West Africa Mountains and the [[Guinea Highlands]].<ref name="eowg"/> However, [[Mount Nimba]] near [[Yekepa]], is higher at {{convert|1752|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] but is not wholly within Liberia as Nimba shares a border with Guinea and [[Ivory Coast]] and is their tallest mountain as well.<ref>Financial Time's World Desk Reference (2004) Dorling Kindersley Publishing, p. 368.</ref>

===Forests===
[[Forest]]s on the coastline are composed mostly of salt-tolerant [[mangrove]] trees, while the more sparsely populated inland has forests opening onto a plateau of drier [[grassland]]s. The climate is [[Tropical rainforest climate|equatorial]], with significant [[rainfall]] during the May–October [[Wet season|rainy season]] and harsh [[harmattan]] winds the remainder of the year. Liberia possesses about forty percent of the remaining [[Upper Guinean forest|Upper Guinean rainforest]]. It was an important producer of [[rubber]] in the early 20th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Liberia is divided into fifteen [[Counties of Liberia|counties]], which, in turn, are subdivided into a total of 90 [[districts]] and further subdivided into ''clans''. The oldest counties are Grand Bassa and Montserrado, both founded in 1839 prior to Liberian independence. Gbarpolu is the newest county, created in 2001. Nimba is the largest of the counties in size at {{convert|11551|km2|abbr=on}}, while Montserrado is the smallest at {{convert|1909|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="census2008"/> Montserrado is also the most populous county with 1,144,806 residents as of the 2008 census.<ref name="census2008"/>

The fifteen counties are administered by superintendents appointed by the president. The Constitution calls for the election of various [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] at the county and local level, but these elections have not taken place since 1985 due to war and financial constraints.<ref name=polls>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7187906.stm |title=Liberia cannot afford local polls |newspaper=BBC News |date=January 14, 2008}}</ref>

Parallel to the administrative divisions of the country are the local and municipal divisions.  Liberia currently does not have any constitutional framework or uniform statutes which deal with the creation or revocation of local governments.<ref name="GCL">{{cite web |last1=KIEH, JR. |first1=GEORGE KLAY |title=THE MODEL CITY STATUTE FOR THE LIBERIAN CITY |url=http://governancecommissionlr.org/pg_img/THE_STATUTE_FOR_THE_MODEL_LIBERIAN_CITY[1].pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412091817/http://governancecommissionlr.org/pg_img/THE_STATUTE_FOR_THE_MODEL_LIBERIAN_CITY%5b1%5d.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 April 2019 |website=Governance Commission of Liberia |publisher=GOVERNANCE COMMISSION OF THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA |access-date=20 July 2018 }}</ref>  All existing local governments – cities, townships, and a borough – were created by specific acts of the Liberian government, and thus the structure and duties/responsibilities of each local government varies greatly from one to the other.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Liberia}}
[[File:Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf3.jpg|thumb|Former President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]]]]
The government of Liberia, modeled on the [[government of the United States]], is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] constitutional republic and [[representative democracy]] as established by the [[Constitution of Liberia|Constitution]]. The government has three co-equal branches of government: the [[Executive (government)|executive]], headed by the [[President of Liberia|president]]; the [[Legislature|legislative]], consisting of the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Legislature of Liberia]]; and the [[Judiciary|judicial]], consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Liberia|Supreme Court]] and several [[lower court]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The president serves as [[head of government]], [[head of state]], and the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Armed Forces of Liberia]].<ref name="CIA"/> Among the president's other duties are to sign or veto [[Bill (law)|legislative bills]], grant [[pardon]]s, and appoint [[Cabinet of Liberia|Cabinet]] members, judges, and other public officials. Together with the [[Vice President of Liberia|vice president]], the president is elected to a six-year term by [[majority vote]] in a [[two-round system]] and can serve up to two terms in office.<ref name="CIA"/>

The Legislature is composed of the [[Senate of Liberia|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives of Liberia|House of Representatives]]. The House, led by a [[speaker (politics)|speaker]], has 73 members [[Apportionment (politics)|apportioned]] among the 15 counties on the basis of the national [[census]], with each county receiving a minimum of two members.<ref name="CIA"/> Each House member represents an [[electoral district]] within a county as drawn by the [[National Election Commission (Liberia)|National Elections Commission]] and is elected by a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] of the popular vote of their district into a six-year term. The Senate is made up of two senators from each county for a total of 30 senators.<ref name="CIA"/> Senators serve nine-year terms and are elected [[at-large]] by a plurality of the popular vote.<ref name="CIA"/> The vice president serves as the [[President of the Senate]], with a [[President pro tempore]] serving in their absence.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Liberia's highest judicial authority is the Supreme Court, made up of five members and headed by the [[Chief Justice of Liberia]]. Members are nominated to the court by the president and are confirmed by the Senate, serving until the age of 70. The judiciary is further divided into [[Circuit court|circuit]] and [[Limited jurisdiction|speciality courts]], [[magistrate]] courts and [[Justice of the Peace|justices of the peace]].<ref name=state>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6618.htm |title=Background Note: Liberia |work=Bureau of African Affairs |publisher=United States Department of State |date=March 8, 2011}}</ref> The judicial system is a blend of [[common law]], based on Anglo-American law, and customary law.<ref name="CIA"/> An informal system of traditional courts still exists within the rural areas of the country, with [[trial by ordeal]] remaining common despite being officially outlawed.<ref name=state/>

===Military===
{{Main|Armed Forces of Liberia}}
The [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL) are the country's armed forces. Founded as the Liberian Frontier Force in 1908, the military was renamed in 1956. For virtually all of its history, the AFL has received considerable material and training assistance from the United States. For most of the 1941–89 period, training was largely provided by U.S. advisers, and combat experience in the 2nd World War. After UN Security Council Resolution 1509 in September 2003, the [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] arrived to referee the ceasefire with units from Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, and China with the view to assist the National Transitional Government of Liberia in forming the new Liberian military.<ref>Moumouni, Guillaume.

After the turmoil following the [[First Liberian Civil War|First]] and [[Second Liberian Civil War]]s, Liberia's internal stabilization in the 21st century brought a return to cordial relations with neighboring countries and much of the Western world.

Most of these Christian denominations were brought by [[African American]] [[settlers]] moving from the [[United States]] into Liberia via the [[American Colonization Society]], while some are indigenous—especially [[Pentecostal]] and [[evangelical Protestant]] ones.

Indigenous people were subject to Christian [[missionary]], as well as Americo-Liberian efforts to close the cultural gap by means of education. This proved successful, leaving Christians a majority in the country.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Liberia is one of only three countries that have not officially adopted the [[International System of Units]] (abbreviated as the SI, also called the metric system), the others being the [[United States]]  and [[Myanmar]].
