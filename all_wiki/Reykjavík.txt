==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Reykjavík|History of Iceland}}
[[File:Ingolf by Raadsig.jpg|thumb|left|A painting by Johan [[Peter Raadsig]] of Ingólfur commanding his high seat pillars to be erected]]
[[File:Reykjavik 1860s.jpg|thumb|right|Reykjavík in the 1860s]]

The first permanent settlement in Iceland by [[Norsemen]] is believed to have been established at Reykjavík by [[Ingólfr Arnarson]] around AD 870; this is described in ''[[Landnámabók]]'', or the Book of Settlement. Ingólfur is said to have decided the location of his settlement using a traditional Norse method: he cast his [[high seat pillars]] (Öndvegissúlur) into the ocean when he saw the coastline, then settled where the pillars came to shore. This story is widely regarded as a legend; it appears likely that he settled near the hot springs to keep warm in the winter and would not have decided the location by happenstance. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the pillars drifted to that location from where they were said to have been thrown from the boat. Nevertheless, that is what the ''Landnamabok'' says, and it says furthermore that Ingólfur's pillars are still to be found in a house in the town.

Steam from hot springs in the region is said to have inspired Reykjavík's name, which loosely translates to Smoke Cove (the city is sometimes referred to as ''Bay of Smoke'' or ''Smoky Bay'' in English language travel guides).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Reykjavik+%22bay+of+smokes%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbo=1 |title=Google.com |accessdate=2012-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014024/http://www.google.com/search?q=reykjavik+%22bay+of+smokes%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 |archive-date=2015-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Reykjavik+%22bay+of+smokes%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbo=1&gws_rd=cr#tbm=bks&q=Reykjavik+%22smoky+bay%22 |title=Google.com |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> In the modern language, as in English, the word for 'smoke' and the word for fog or steamy vapour are not commonly confused, but this is believed to have been the case in the old language.
The original name was Reykja'''r'''vík (with an additional "r" representing the usual genitive ending of strong nouns) but this had vanished around 1800.<ref>[http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2252 Er eitthvert örnefni á höfuðborgarsvæðinu eða vík eða vogur, sem heitir Reykjavík?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112309/https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2252 |date=2017-11-07 }}. Vísindavefur. (in Icelandic)</ref>

The Reykjavík area was farmland until the 18th century. In 1752, [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederik V of Denmark]] donated the estate of Reykjavík to the [[Innréttingar Corporation]]; the name comes from the [[Danish language|Danish-language]] word ''indretninger'', meaning institution. The leader of this movement was {{Interlanguage link multi|Skúli Magnússon|is}}. In the 1750s, several houses were built to house the [[wool]] industry, which was Reykjavík's most important employer for a few decades and the original reason for its existence. Other industries were undertaken by the Innréttingar, such as [[fishing|fisheries]], [[sulfur|sulphur mining]], agriculture, and shipbuilding.<ref>[http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=1752 Hvaðan kemur nafnið "Innréttingarnar" á fyrirtækinu sem starfaði hér á á 18. öld?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910092150/http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=1752 |date=2016-09-10 }}. Vísindavefur. (in Icelandic)</ref>

The Danish Crown abolished monopoly trading in 1786 and granted six communities around the country an exclusive trading charter. Reykjavík was one of them and the only one to hold on to the charter permanently. 1786 is thus regarded as the date of the city's founding. Trading rights were limited to subjects of the Danish Crown, and Danish traders continued to dominate trade in Iceland. Over the following decades, their business in Iceland expanded. After 1880, [[free trade]] was expanded to all nationalities, and the influence of Icelandic merchants started to grow.

===Rise of nationalism===
[[File:Pg107 Main street of Reykjavik and Governors house.jpg|thumb|Reykjavík in 1881]]

[[Icelandic nationalism|Icelandic nationalist]] sentiment gained influence in the 19th century, and the idea of Icelandic independence became widespread. Reykjavík, as Iceland's only city, was central to such ideas. Advocates of an independent Iceland realized that a strong Reykjavík was fundamental to that objective. All the important events in the history of the independence struggle were important to Reykjavík as well. In 1845 [[Althing|Alþingi]], the general assembly formed in 930 AD, was re-established in Reykjavík; it had been suspended a few decades earlier when it was located at [[Þingvellir]]. At the time it functioned only as an advisory assembly, advising the king about Icelandic affairs. The location of Alþingi in Reykjavík effectively established the city as the capital of Iceland.

In 1874, Iceland was given a constitution; with it, Alþingi gained some limited legislative powers and in essence became the institution that it is today. The next step was to move most of the executive power to Iceland: [[Home rule|Home Rule]] was granted in 1904 when the office of [[Prime Minister of Iceland|Minister For Iceland]] was established in Reykjavík. The biggest step towards an independent Iceland was taken on 1 December 1918 when Iceland became a sovereign country under the [[List of Danish monarchs|Crown of Denmark]], the [[Kingdom of Iceland]].

By the 1920s and 1930s most of the growing Icelandic fishing trawler fleet sailed from Reykjavík; [[cod]] production was its main industry, but the [[Great Depression]] hit Reykjavík hard with unemployment, and labour union struggles sometimes became violent.

===World War II===
On the morning of 10 May 1940, following the German occupation of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] on 9 April 1940, four British warships approached Reykjavík and anchored in the harbour. In a few hours, the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] [[Invasion of Iceland|occupation of Reykjavík]] was complete. There was no armed resistance, and taxi and truck drivers even assisted the invasion force, which initially had no motor vehicles. The Icelandic government had received many requests from the British government to consent to the occupation, but it always declined on the basis of the [[Neutral country|Neutrality Policy]]. For the remaining years of [[World War II]], British and later American soldiers occupied camps in Reykjavík, and the number of foreign soldiers in Reykjavík became about the same as the local population of the city. [[The Royal Regiment of Canada]] formed part of the garrison in Iceland during the early part of the war.

The economic effects of the occupation were positive for Reykjavík: the unemployment of the Depression years vanished, and construction work began. The British built [[Reykjavík Airport]], which is still in service today, mostly for short haul flights (to domestic destinations and Greenland). The Americans, meanwhile, built [[Keflavík International Airport|Keflavík Airport]], situated {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Reykjavík, which became Iceland's primary international airport. In 1944, the Republic of Iceland was founded and a [[List of Presidents of Iceland|president]], elected by the people, replaced the king; the office of the president was placed in Reykjavík.

===Post-war development===
In the post-war years, the growth of Reykjavík accelerated. An exodus from the rural countryside began, largely because improved technology in agriculture reduced the need for manpower, and because of a population boom resulting from better living conditions in the country. A once-primitive village was rapidly transformed into a modern city. Private cars became common, and modern apartment complexes rose in the expanding suburbs.

In 1972, Reykjavík hosted the [[World Chess Championship 1972|world chess championship]] between [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]]. The 1986 [[Reykjavík Summit]] between [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] underlined Reykjavík's international status. [[Deregulation]] in the financial sector and the computer revolution of the 1990s again transformed Reykjavík. The financial and IT sectors are now significant employers in the city. 

The city has fostered some world-famous musicians and artists in recent decades, such as [[Björk]], [[Ólafur Arnalds]] and bands [[Múm]], [[Sigur Rós]] and [[Of Monsters and Men]], poet [[Sjón]] and visual artist [[Ragnar Kjartansson (sculptor)|Ragnar Kjartansson]].

==Geography==
[[File:Reykjavikfromabove.jpg|thumb|Reykjavík seen from above]]
[[File:Reykjavik Esja.jpg|thumb|[[Esjan|Esja]], the mountain range to the north of Reykjavík]]

Reykjavík is located in the southwest of [[Iceland]]. The Reykjavík area coastline is characterized by peninsulas, coves, straits, and islands.

During the [[Quaternary glaciation|Ice Age]] (up to 10,000 years ago) a large glacier covered parts of the city area, reaching as far out as [[Álftanes]]. Other parts of the city area were covered by sea water. In the warm periods and at the end of the Ice Age, some hills like Öskjuhlíð were islands. The former sea level is indicated by sediments (with clams) reaching (at Öskjuhlíð, for example) as far as {{convert|43|m|0|abbr=on}} above the current sea level. The hills of Öskjuhlíð and Skólavörðuholt appear to be the remains of former [[shield volcanoes]] which were active during the warm periods of the Ice Age. After the Ice Age, the land rose as the heavy load of the glaciers fell away, and began to look as it does today.

The capital city area continued to be shaped by earthquakes and [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], like the one 4,500 years ago in the mountain range Bláfjöll, when the lava coming down the Elliðaá valley reached the sea at the bay of Elliðavogur.

The largest river to run through Reykjavík is the [[Elliðaár|Elliðaá]] River, which is non-navigable. It is one of the best [[salmon]] fishing rivers in the country. Mount [[Esja]], at {{convert|914|m|0|abbr=on}}, is the highest mountain in the vicinity of Reykjavík.

The city of Reykjavík is mostly located on the Seltjarnarnes peninsula, but the suburbs reach far out to the south and east. Reykjavík is a spread-out city: most of its urban area consists of low-density suburbs, and houses are usually widely spaced. The outer residential neighbourhoods are also widely spaced from each other; in between them are the main traffic arteries and a lot of empty space. The city's latitude is 64°08' N, making it the [[List of northernmost items|world's northernmost capital]] of a sovereign state ([[Nuuk]], the capital of [[Greenland]], is slightly further north at 64°10', but Greenland is a [[Denmark#Greenland and the Faroe Islands|constituent country]], not an independent state).

===Climate===

Reykjavík has a [[Oceanic climate#Subpolar variety (Cfc)|subpolar oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfc'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=3040&cityname=Reykjavik,+Capital+Region,+Iceland&units=|title=Reykjavik, Iceland Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref> closely bordering on a [[subarctic climate|continental subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfc'') in the 0&nbsp;°C isoterm. While not much different from a [[tundra climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] : ''ET''), the city has had its present climate classification since the beginning of the twentieth century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&layers=7a53584fa55643df969f93cec83788e1|title=Köppen Climate Classification of 1900-2100|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108224555/https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&layers=7a53584fa55643df969f93cec83788e1|archive-date=2018-11-08|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/shifts.htm|title=Shifts climate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130211037/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/shifts.htm|archive-date=2018-11-30|url-status=live}}</ref>

At 64° north, Reykjavik is characterized by extremes of day and night length over the course of the year. From 20 May to 24 July, daylight is essentially permanent as the sun never gets more than 5° below the horizon. Day length drops to less than five hours between 2 December and 10 January. The sun climbs just 3° above the horizon during this time. However, day length begins increasing rapidly during January and by month's end there are seven hours of daylight.

Despite its northern latitude, temperatures very rarely drop below {{convert|-15|C|0}} in the winter. The proximity to the [[Arctic Circle]] and the strong moderation of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the [[Iceland]]ic coast (influence of [[North Atlantic Current]], an extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]) shape a relatively mild winter and cool summer. The city's coastal location does make it prone to wind, however, and [[gale]]s are common in winter.&nbsp;{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Summers are cool, with temperatures fluctuating between {{convert|10|and|15|C}}, rarely exceeding {{convert|20|C|0}}. This is a result of exposure to the maritime winds in its exposed west coast location that causes it to be much cooler in summer than similar latitudes in mainland [[Scandinavia]]. Reykjavík averages 147 days of rain (more than 1&nbsp;mm) per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/place/Iceland/Capital_Region/Reykjavik/statistics.html|title=Weather statistics for Reykjavik|work=yr.no|access-date=2015-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107223017/http://www.yr.no/place/Iceland/Capital_Region/Reykjavik/statistics.html|archive-date=2015-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref> Droughts are uncommon, although they occur in some summers. July and August are the warmest months of the year on average and January and February the coldest.

In the summer of 2007, no rain was measured for one month. Summer tends to be the sunniest season, although May averages the most sunshine of any individual month.

==City administration==
The [[Reykjavík City Council]] governs the city of Reykjavík<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.althingi.is/lagas/128b/1998045.html |title=1998 nr. 45 3. júní/ Sveitarstjórnarlög |publisher=Althingi.is |accessdate=2009-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021235217/http://www.althingi.is/lagas/128b/1998045.html |archive-date=2009-10-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> and is directly elected by those aged over 18 domiciled in the city. The council has 23 members who are elected using the [[open list]] method for four-year terms.

The council selects members of boards, and each board controls a different field under the city council's authority. The most important board is the City Board that wields the executive rights along with the City Mayor. The City Mayor is the senior public official and also the director of city operations. Other public officials control city institutions under the mayor's authority. Thus, the administration consists of two different parts:
*The political power of City Council cascading down to other boards
*Public officials under the authority of the city mayor who administer and manage implementation of policy.

===Political control===
The [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] was historically the city's ruling party; it had an overall majority from its establishment in 1929 until 1978, when it narrowly lost. From 1978 until 1982, there was a three-party coalition composed of the [[People's Alliance (Iceland)|People's Alliance]], the [[Social Democratic Party (Iceland)|Social Democratic Party]], and the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]]. In 1982, the Independence Party regained an overall majority, which it held for three consecutive terms. The 1994 election was won by [[Reykjavíkurlistinn]] (the R-list), an alliance of Icelandic socialist parties, led by [[Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir]]. This alliance won a majority in three consecutive elections, but was dissolved for the 2006 election when five different parties were on the ballot. The Independence Party won seven seats, and together with the one Progressive Party they were able to form a new majority in the council which took over in June 2006.

In October 2007 a new majority was formed on the council, consisting of members of the Progressive Party, the [[Social Democratic Alliance]], the [[Left-Green Movement|Left-Greens]] and the F-list (liberals and independents), after controversy regarding REI, a subsidiary of OR, the city's energy company. However, three months later the F-list formed a new majority together with the Independence Party. [[Ólafur Friðrik Magnússon|Ólafur F. Magnússon]], the leader of the F-list, was elected mayor on 24 January 2008, and in March 2009 the Independence Party was due to appoint a new mayor. This changed once again on 14 August 2008 when the fourth coalition of the term was formed, by the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance, with [[Hanna Birna Kristjánsdóttir]] becoming mayor.

The [[2010 Icelandic municipal elections|City Council election in May 2010]] saw a new political party, [[Besti flokkurinn|The Best Party]], win six of 15 seats, and they formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance; comedian [[Jón Gnarr]] became mayor.<ref name=best>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10194757.stm | title = Best Party wins polls in Iceland's Reykjavík | accessdate = 2010-05-30 | date = 2010-05-30 | work = [[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> At the 2014 election, the Social Democratic Alliance had its best showing yet, gaining five seats in the council, while [[Bright Future (Iceland)|Bright Future]] (successor to the Best Party) received two seats and the two parties formed a coalition with the [[Left-Green movement]] and the [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]], which won one seat each. The Independence Party had its worst election ever, with only four seats.

===Mayor===
{{Main|Mayor of Reykjavík City}}

The mayor is appointed by the city council; usually one of the council members is chosen, but they may also appoint a mayor who is not a member of the council.

The post was created in 1907 and advertised in 1908. Two applications were received, from [[Páll Einarsson]], sheriff and town mayor of [[Hafnarfjörður]] and from [[Knud Zimsen]], town councillor in Reykjavík. Páll was appointed on 7 May and was mayor for six years. At that time the city mayor received a salary of 4,500 ISK per year and 1,500 ISK for office expenses. The current mayor is [[Dagur B. Eggertsson]].<ref>[http://grapevine.is/news/2014/06/17/jon-gnarr-is-no-longer-mayor-of-reykjavik/ Jón Glarr is no longer mayor of Reykjavík] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323182538/http://grapevine.is/news/2014/06/17/jon-gnarr-is-no-longer-mayor-of-reykjavik/ |date=2016-03-23 }}.

===Districts===
[[File:Administrative map of Reykjavík.png|thumb|left|width=507|Districts of Reykjavík]]
Reykjavík is divided into 10 districts:
*[[Vesturbær]] (District 1)
*[[Miðborg]] (District 2, ''city centre'')
*[[Hlíðar]] (District 3)
*[[Laugardalur]] (District 4)
*[[Háaleiti og Bústaðir]] (District 5)
*[[Breiðholt]] (District 6)
*[[Árbær]] (District 7)
*[[Grafarvogur]] (District 8)
*[[Kjalarnes]] (District 9) (in the north)
*[[Grafarholt og Úlfarsárdalur]] (District 10)

In addition there are [[hinterland]] areas (lightly shaded on the map) which are not assigned to any district.
{{clear}}

==Economy==
[[Borgartún]] is the financial centre of Reykjavík, hosting a large number of companies and three investment banks.
[[File:Hvalur 6, 7, 8 and 9.JPG|thumb|Old whaling ships ''Hvalur'' 6, 7, 8 and 9]]

Reykjavík has been at the centre of Iceland's economic growth and subsequent economic contraction over the 2000s, a period referred to in foreign media as the "Nordic Tiger" years,<ref>{{cite news|last=Surowiecki|first=James|title=Iceland's Deep Freeze|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2008/04/21/080421ta_talk_surowiecki|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=2008-04-21|access-date=2012-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302192558/http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2008/04/21/080421ta_talk_surowiecki|archive-date=2012-03-02|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kvam|first=Berit|title=Iceland: light at the end of the tunnel?|journal=Nordic Labour Journal|date=2009-06-19|url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/artikler/insikt-og-analyse/innsikt-og-analyse-2009/optimisme-tross-dystre-utsikter-i-island|access-date=2012-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103192743/http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/artikler/insikt-og-analyse/innsikt-og-analyse-2009/optimisme-tross-dystre-utsikter-i-island|archive-date=2012-01-03|url-status=live}}</ref> or "Iceland's Boom Years".<ref>{{cite news|title=Iceland: the boom years|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/iceland/6047393/Iceland-the-boom-years.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=2009-08-18|access-date=2018-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515115244/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/iceland/6047393/Iceland-the-boom-years.html|archive-date=2018-05-15|url-status=live}}</ref> The economic boom led to a sharp increase in construction, with large redevelopment projects such as [[Harpa (concert hall)|Harpa]] concert hall and conference centre and others. Many of these projects came to a halt in the following [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|economic crash of 2008]].

==Infrastructure==

===Roads===
Per capita [[Automobile|car]] ownership in Iceland is among the highest in the world at roughly 522 vehicles per 1,000 residents,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/tra_mot_veh-transportation-motor-vehicles| publisher=nationmaster.com| work=United Nations World Statistics Pocketbook| title=Motor vehicles (most recent) by country| accessdate=2010-03-29| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327112758/http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/tra_mot_veh-transportation-motor-vehicles| archive-date=2010-03-27| url-status=live}}</ref> though Reykjavík is not severely affected by [[Traffic congestion|congestion]]. Several multi-lane highways (mainly [[dual carriageway]]s) run between the most heavily populated areas and most frequently driven routes. Parking spaces are also plentiful in most areas. Public transportation consists of a bus system called [[Strætó bs]]. [[Route 1 (Iceland)|Route 1]] (the Ring Road) runs through the city outskirts and connects the city to the rest of Iceland.

===Airports and seaports===
[[Reykjavík Airport]], the second largest airport in the country (after [[Keflavík International Airport]]), is positioned inside the city, just south of the city centre. It is mainly used for domestic flights, as well as flights to [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Since 1962, there has been some controversy regarding the location of the airport, since it takes up a lot of valuable space in central Reykjavík.

Reykjavík has two [[seaport]]s, the old harbour near the city centre which is mainly used by [[fisheries|fishermen]] and [[cruise ship]]s, and ''Sundahöfn'' in the east city which is the largest [[cargo]] port in the country.
[[File:Reykjavík Old Harbor.jpg|thumb|Old Harbour]]

===Railways===
[[File:RHR-Minor.JPG|thumb|right|Two steam locomotives were used to build the harbour [[Rail transport in Iceland|Reykjavík Docks railway]]; both are now on display in Reykjavík]]

There are no public railways in Iceland, because of its sparse population, but the locomotives used to build the docks are on display. Proposals have been made for a high-speed rail link between the city and [[Keflavík]].

===District heating===
{{See also|Geothermal power in Iceland}}
Volcanic activity provides Reykjavík with [[geothermal heating]] systems for both residential and industrial districts. In 2008, natural hot water was used to heat roughly 90% of all buildings in Iceland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.is/geothermal/direct-utilization/ |title=NEA.is |publisher=NEA.is |accessdate=2012-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724215329/http://www.nea.is/geothermal/direct-utilization |archive-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> Of total annual use of geothermal energy of 39 [[Joule|PJ]], space heating accounted for 48%.

Most of the [[district heating]] in Iceland comes from three main geothermal power plants:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mannvit.com/GeothermalEnergy/DistrictHeating/DistrictHeatinginIceland/ |title=Mannvit |publisher=Mannvit |accessdate=2012-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007194242/http://www.mannvit.com/GeothermalEnergy/DistrictHeating/DistrictHeatinginIceland/ |archive-date=2011-10-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Cultural heritage==
[[Safnahúsið]] (the Culture House) was opened in 1909 and has a number of important exhibits. Originally built to house the National Library and National Archives and also previously the location of the National Museum and Natural History Museum, in 2000 it was re-modeled to promote the Icelandic national heritage. Many of Iceland's national treasures are on display, such as the Poetic Edda, and the Sagas in their original manuscripts. There are also changing exhibitions of various topics.<ref>Guide leaflet to the Culture House 2008, published by the National Centre for Cultural Heritage.</ref>

==Lifestyle==

===Nightlife===
[[File:Laugarvegur01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Laugavegur (Reykjavík)|Laugavegur]] main street in downtown Reykjavík]]

[[alcoholic drink|Alcohol]] is expensive at bars. People tend to drink at home before going out. Beer was [[Prohibition in Iceland|banned]] in Iceland until 1 March 1989 but has since become popular among many Icelanders as their alcoholic drink of choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=GWNJYhhJ9lt0MbY6X86ny7Z6LKLhJbqnBs8QyfG9sGJx6JvRT1qN!-1963512867?docId=5001321944 |title=The Dynamics of Shifts in Alcoholic Beverage Preference: Effects of the Legalization of Beer in Iceland |publisher=Questia.com |accessdate=2009-07-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901210249/http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst%3Bjsessionid%3DGWNJYhhJ9lt0MbY6X86ny7Z6LKLhJbqnBs8QyfG9sGJx6JvRT1qN%21-1963512867?docId=5001321944 |archive-date=September 1, 2008 }}</ref>

===Live music===
The [[Iceland Airwaves]] music festival is staged annually in November. This festival takes place all over the city, and the concert venue [[Harpa (concert hall)|Harpa]] is one of the main locations. Other venues that frequently organise live music events are Kex, Húrra, Gaukurinn ([[grunge]], [[Heavy metal music|metal]], [[punk rock|punk]]), Mengi (centre for [[contemporary music]], [[avant-garde music]] and [[experimental music]]), [[the Icelandic Opera]] and the [[National Theatre of Iceland]] for classical music.

===New Year's Eve===
The arrival of the new year is a particular cause for celebration to the people of Reykjavík. Icelandic law states that anyone may purchase and use fireworks during a certain period around New Year's Eve. As a result, every New Year's Eve the city is lit up with [[fireworks]] displays.
