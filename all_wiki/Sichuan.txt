'''Sichuan''' (<!-- details in infobox -->{{IPAc-en|'|s|ɛ|ʃ|w|ɒ|n}}{{zh|s={{Audio|Sichuan.ogg|四川|help=no}}|labels=no}}; [[Postal romanization|alternatively romanized]] as '''Szechuan''' or '''Szechwan''') is a landlocked [[Provinces of China|province]] in [[Southwest China]] occupying most of the [[Sichuan Basin]] and the easternmost part of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] between the [[Jinsha River]] on the west, the [[Daba Mountains]] in the north, and the [[Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau|Yungui Plateau]] to the south. Sichuan's capital city is [[Chengdu]]. The population of Sichuan stands at 81 million.

In antiquity, Sichuan was the home of the [[states of ancient China|ancient states]] of [[state of Ba|Ba]] and [[state of Shu|Shu]]. Their conquest by [[state of Qin|Qin]] strengthened it and paved the way for the [[Qin Shi Huang]]'s [[Qin's wars of unification|unification]] of China under the [[Qin dynasty]]. During the [[Three Kingdoms]] era, [[Liu Bei]]'s [[Shu-Han|Shu]] was based in Sichuan. The area was devastated in the 17th century by [[Zhang Xianzhong]]'s rebellion and the area's subsequent [[Qing Empire|Manchu]] conquest, but recovered to become one of China's most productive areas by the 19th century. During [[World War II]], [[Chongqing]] served as the temporary capital of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], making it the focus of [[Bombing of Chongqing|Japanese bombing]]. It was one of the last [[mainland China|mainland]] areas captured by the [[People's Liberation Army]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and was divided into four parts from 1949 to 1952, with Chongqing restored two years later. It suffered gravely during the [[Great Chinese Famine]] of 1959–61 but remained China's [[list of Chinese provinces|most populous province]] until [[Chongqing Municipality]] was again separated from it in 1997.

The [[Han Chinese]] [[Sichuanese people|people]] of Sichuan speak a [[Sichuanese Mandarin|unique form]] of [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], which took shape during the area's repopulation under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]. The family of dialects is now spoken by about 120 million people, which would make it the [[Most spoken languages of the world|10th most spoken language in the world]] if counted separately. The area's warm damp climate long caused [[traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]] to advocate [[spicy food|spicy dishes]]; the native [[Sichuan pepper]] helped to form modern [[Sichuan cuisine]], whose dishes—including [[Kung Pao chicken]] and [[mapo tofu]]—have become staples of Chinese cuisine around the world.

In 1950, the province of [[Xikang]] was dissolved and its territory was later split between the newly established [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and the Province of Sichuan. The western and northwestern part of Sichuan is made up of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Qiang people|Qiang]] autonomous areas.

=={{anchor|Etymology|Names}}Names==
It is commonly believed that the name ''Sichuan'' means "four [[rivers of China|rivers]]", and in [[folk etymology]] this is usually taken to mean four of the province's major rivers: the [[Jialing River|Jialing]], [[Jinsha River|Jinsha]] (or [[Wu River (Yangtze tributary)|Wu]]), [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min]], and [[Tuo River|Tuo]].<ref name=ruf>{{citation |last=Ruf |first=Gregory Anthony |title=Pillars of the State: Laboring Families, Authority, and Community in Rural Sichuan, 1937–1991 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |date=1994 |page=68 }}</ref><ref name=rowan>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXYgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 |title=Ancient Central China: Centers and Peripheries along the Yangzi River|authors= Rowan K.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The [[Sichuan Basin]] and adjacent areas of the [[Yangtze]] watershed were a cradle of indigenous civilizations dating back to at least the 15th century&nbsp;BC, coinciding with the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] in northern China. The region had its own distinct religious beliefs and worldview. The earliest culture found in the region through archaeological investigation is the [[Baodun culture]] ({{circa}}2700–1750 BC) excavated in the [[Chengdu Plain]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3XG3H_WlM8C&pg=PT164 |title=A Companion to Chinese Archaeology |editor= Anne P.

===Ba and Shu Kingdoms===
[[File:Bronze_head_from_Sanxingdui.JPG|thumb|upright|Bronze head from [[Sanxingdui]], dating from the [[Shu (state)|Shu]] kingdom]]
The most important native states were those of Ba and Shu.

[[State of Ba|Ba]] stretched into Sichuan from the [[Han River (Shaanxi)|Han Valley]] in [[Shaanxi]] and [[Hubei]] down the [[Jialing River]] as far as its confluence with the [[Yangtze]] at [[Chongqing]].<ref name=kongzi>{{cite book |title=Ancient Sichuan and the Unification of China |author= Steven F.

===Qin dynasty===
The rulers of the expansionist state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]], based in present-day [[Gansu]] and [[Shaanxi]], were the first strategists to realize that the area's military importance matched its commercial and agricultural significance. The Sichuan basin is surrounded by the [[Hengduan Mountains]] to the west, the [[Qin Mountains]] to the north, and [[Yungui Plateau]] to the south. Since the Yangtze flows through the basin and then through the perilous Three Gorges to eastern and southern China, Sichuan was a staging area for amphibious military forces and a haven for political refugees.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Qin armies finished their conquest of the kingdoms of Shu and Ba by 316 BC. Any written records and civil achievements of earlier kingdoms were destroyed. Qin administrators introduced improved agricultural technology. [[Li Bing (administrator)|Li Bing]], engineered the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system]] to control the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min River]], a major [[tributary]] of the Yangtze. This innovative hydraulic system was composed of movable weirs which could be adjusted for high or low water flow according to the season, to either provide irrigation or prevent floods. The increased agricultural output and taxes made the area a source of provisions and men for Qin's unification of China.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===Han dynasty===

Sichuan was subjected to the autonomous control of kings named by the imperial family of Han dynasty. Following the declining central government of the [[Han dynasty]] in the second century, the Sichuan basin, surrounded by mountains and easily defensible, became a popular place for upstart generals to found kingdoms that challenged the authority of Yangtze Valley emperors over China.<ref name="Haw"/>

In 221, during the partition following the fall of the [[Eastern Han]] – the era of the [[Three Kingdoms]] – [[Liu Bei]] founded the southwest kingdom of [[Shu Han]] ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|蜀|汉}}}}; 221–263) in parts of Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan, with [[Chengdu]] as its capital.

In 263, the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] of North China, [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|conquered]] the Kingdom of Shu-Han as its first step on the path to reunify China, under their rule. [[Salt in Chinese history|Salt production]] becomes a major business in [[Ziliujing District]]. During this [[Six Dynasties]] period of Chinese disunity, Sichuan began to be populated by non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnic minority peoples, owing to the migration of [[Gelao people]] from the [[Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau]] to the Sichuan basin, where the Han are indigenous.

===Tang dynasty===

Sichuan came under the firm control of a Chinese central government during the [[Sui dynasty]], but it was during the subsequent [[Tang dynasty]] where Sichuan regained its previous political and cultural prominence for which it was known during the Han. Chengdu became nationally known as a supplier of armies and the home of [[Du Fu]], who is sometimes called China's greatest poet. During the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755–763), [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] fled from [[Chang'an]] to Sichuan which became his refuge. The region was torn by constant warfare and economic distress as it was besieged by the [[Tibetan Empire]].<ref name="Tara">{{cite book|title=The Territories of the People's Republic of China|first1=Tara|last1=Boland-Crewe|first2=David|last2=Lea|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|pages=187–189}}</ref>

===Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms===
In the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], Sichuan became the centre of the [[Former Shu|Shu kingdom]] with its capital in [[Chengdu]] founded by [[Wang Jian (Former Shu)|Wang Jian]]. In 925 the kingdom was absorbed into [[Later Tang]] but would regain independence under [[Meng Zhixiang]] who founded [[Later Shu]] in 934. Later Shu would continue until 965 when it was absorbed by the [[Song dynasty|Song]].

===Song dynasty===
During [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), [[Sichuanese people|Sichuanese]] were able to protect themselves from [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] attacks with the help of central government. Sichuan also saw cultural revival like great poets [[Su Xun]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|蘇洵}}), [[Su Shi]], and [[Su Zhe]].<ref name="Tara"/> Although paper currency was known in the Tang dynasty, in 1023 AD, the first true [[Banknote|paper money]] in human history, termed ''jiaozi'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=[[:zh:交子|交子]] |p=jiāozǐ}}), was issued in [[Chengdu]].<ref>Horesh Niv , 2012, "From Chengdu to Stockholm: A Comparative Study of the Emergence of Paper Money in East and West"</ref><ref>Hans G.Wiedemann & Gerhard Bayer, 1992, "Approach to ancient Chinese artifacts by means of thermal analysis", Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam</ref><ref>Pan Jixing, 1998, "On the origin of movable metal-type technique", Chinese Science Bulletin</ref>

In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Southern Song dynasty established coordinated defenses against the [[Mongols|Mongolian]] [[Yuan dynasty]], in Sichuan and [[Xiangzhou District, Xiangyang|Xiangyang]].

In the middle of the 17th century, the peasant rebel leader [[Zhang Xianzhong]] (1606–1646) from [[Yan'an]], [[Shaanxi]] Province, nicknamed ''Yellow Tiger'', led his peasant troop from north China to the south, and conquered Sichuan.

===Republic of China===
[[File:Japanese bombing chinese main road.jpg|thumb|Japanese bombers bombing a Chinese road in Sichuan during WW2]]
In the early 20th century, the newly founded [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] established Chuanbian Special Administrative District ({{lang|zh-hant|川邊特別行政區}}), which acknowledged the unique culture and economy of the region largely differing from that of mainstream northern China in the [[Yellow River]] region. The Special District later became the province of [[Xikang]], incorporating the areas inhabited by Yi, Tibetan and Qiang ethnic minorities to its west, and eastern part of today's [[Tibet Autonomous Region]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

In the 20th century, as [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Nanjing]], and [[Wuhan]] had all been occupied by the Japanese during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the capital of the Republic of China had been temporary relocated to [[Chongqing]], then a major city in Sichuan. An enduring legacy of this move is that nearby inland provinces, such as [[Shaanxi]], [[Gansu]], and [[Guizhou]], which previously never had [[History of education in China|modern Western-style universities]], began to be developed in this regard.<ref>{{cite book|title=Teachers' Schools and the Making of the Modern Chinese Nation-State, 1897–1937|first=Xiaoping|last=Cong|publisher=UBC Press|year=2011|page=203}}</ref> The difficulty of accessing the region overland from the eastern part of China and the foggy climate hindering the accuracy of [[Sichuan invasion|Japanese bombing]] of the [[Sichuan Basin]], made the region the stronghold of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Kuomintang]] government during 1938–45, and led to the [[Bombing of Chongqing]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Chiang Kai-shek himself flew to Chongqing from [[Taiwan]] in November 1949 to lead the defense. But the same month Chongqing switched to the Communists, followed by Chengdu on 10 December. The Kuomintang general [[Wang Sheng (soldier)|Wang Sheng]] wanted to stay behind with his troops to continue anticommunist guerilla war in Sichuan, but was recalled to Taiwan. Many of his soldiers made their way there as well, via [[Burma]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Thomas A.|title=Counterrevolution in China: Wang Sheng and the Kuomintang|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London|year=1998|isbn=0-7146-4700-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04QiOlNKQGEC&pg=PA116|pages=116–117}}</ref>

===People's Republic of China===
The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, and it split Sichuan into four areas and separated out Chongqing municipality. Sichuan was reconstituted in 1952, with Chongqing added in 1954, while the former [[Xikang]] province was split between [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] in the west and Sichuan in the east.<ref name="Tara"/>

==Geography and biodiversity==
Sichuan consists of two geographically very distinct parts. The eastern part of the province is mostly within the fertile [[Sichuan basin]] (which is shared by Sichuan with Chongqing Municipality). The western Sichuan consists of the numerous mountain ranges forming the easternmost part of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], which are known generically as [[Hengduan Mountains]]. One of these ranges, [[Daxue Mountains]], contains the highest point of the province [[Gongga Shan]], at {{cvt|7556|m|ft}} above sea level. The mountains are formed by the collision of the Tibetan Plateau with the [[Yangtze Plate]]. Faults here include the [[Longmenshan Fault]] which ruptured during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Other mountain ranges surround the Sichuan Basin from north, east, and south. Among them are the [[Daba Mountains]], in the province's northeast.

The [[Yangtze River]] and its tributaries flows through the mountains of western Sichuan and the Sichuan Basin; thus, the province is upstream of the great cities that stand along the Yangtze River further to the east, such as [[Chongqing]], [[Wuhan]], [[Nanjing]] and [[Shanghai]]. One of the major tributaries of the Yangtze within the province is the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min River]] of central Sichuan, which joins the Yangtze at [[Yibin]]. They are also a number of other rivers, such as [[Jialing River]], [[Tuo River]], [[Yalong River]], [[Wu River (Yangtze tributary)|Wu River]] and [[Jinsha River]], and any four of the various rivers are often grouped as the "four rivers" that the name of Sichuan is commonly and mistakenly believed to mean.<ref name=ruf /><ref name=rowan />

Due to great differences in terrain, the climate of the province is highly variable. In general it has strong [[monsoon]]al influences, with rainfall heavily concentrated in the summer. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], the [[Sichuan Basin]] (including [[Chengdu]]) in the eastern half of the province experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen ''Cwa'' or ''Cfa''), with long, hot, wet summers and short, mild to cool, dry and cloudy winters. Consequently, it has China's lowest sunshine totals. The western region has mountainous areas producing a cooler but sunnier climate. Having cool to very cold winters and mild summers, temperatures generally decrease with greater elevation. However, due to high altitude and its inland location, many areas such as Garze County and Zoige County in Sichuan exhibit a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwc'')- featuring extremely cold winters down to −30&nbsp;°C and even cold summer nights. The region is geologically active with landslides and earthquakes. Average elevation ranges from 2,000 to 3,500 meters; average temperatures range from 0 to 15&nbsp;°C.<ref name=TibetansSichuan>{{cite journal|title=Study on Rural Poverty in Ecologically Fragile Areas-A Case Study of the Tibetan Areas in Sichuan Province|journal=Asian Agricultural Research|year=2012|volume=4|issue=1|pages=27–31, 61|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/133098/2/06.PDF|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Lan Hong-xing|publisher=USA-China Science and Culture Media Corporation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513063229/http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/133098/2/06.PDF|archive-date=13 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The southern part of the province, including Panzhihua and Xichang, has a sunny climate with short, very mild winters and very warm to hot summers.

Sichuan borders [[Qinghai]] to the northwest, [[Gansu]] to the north, [[Shaanxi]] to the northeast, [[Chongqing]] to the east, [[Guizhou]] to the southeast, [[Yunnan]] to the south, and the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] to the west.

===Giant panda===

[[File:Chengdu-pandas-d10.jpg|thumb|[[Giant panda]]s eating bamboo in [[Chengdu]], Sichuan]]

[[Giant panda]]s live in [[Bamboo|bamboo forests]] and low mountainous areas such as the [[Min Mountains|Minshan Mountains]] in Sichuan.<ref>[https://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/giant_panda/panda/where_panda_lives_habitat/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501161518/http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/giant_panda/panda/where_panda_lives_habitat/ |date=1 May 2018 }}, Survey in Minshang Mountains by Michel</ref> The majority of the panda population lives in Sichuan, with their range spreading into [[Shaanxi]] and [[Gansu]]. As it is abundant where they live, pandas' diet consists of 99% bamboo, with small other plants, or small animals consisting of the other 1%. Since the panda is native to China, it is the national symbol of China.<ref>[http://www.spiritanimal.info/panda-spirit-animal/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424202525/http://www.spiritanimal.info/panda-spirit-animal/ |date=24 April 2018 }}, Panda Symbolism by Elena Harris.</ref>

===Linpan settlements===
The [[Linpan in Chengdu Plain]] is a special settlement in [[Chengdu Plain]], which consists of farm house with woods around, irrigation system, farm land and is elementary unit of the village within the scattered locations. The rural landscape of Chengdu Plain is unique because of the typical element "Linpan".{{original research inline|date=March 2019}}{{clarify|date=March 2019}}

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Sichuan|List of current Chinese provincial leaders}}
The politics of Sichuan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].

The governor of Sichuan is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Sichuan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Sichuan Communist Party of China's [[Party Committee Secretary]], colloquially termed the "Sichuan CPC Party Chief".

Sichuan has been historically known as the "Province of Abundance". It is one of the major agricultural production bases of China. Grain, including rice and wheat, is the major product with output that ranked first in China in 1999. Commercial crops include citrus fruits, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, peaches and grapes. Sichuan also had the largest output of pork among all the provinces and the second largest output of silkworm cocoons in 1999. Sichuan is rich in mineral resources. It has more than 132 kinds of proven underground mineral resources including vanadium, titanium, and lithium being the largest in China. The Panxi region alone possesses 13.3% of the reserves of iron, 93% of titanium, 69% of vanadium, and 83% of the cobalt of the whole country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tdctrade.com/mktprof/china/mpsic.htm |title=SICHUAN PROVINCE (hktdc.com) |access-date=5 February 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208093813/http://www.tdctrade.com/mktprof/china/mpsic.htm |archive-date=8 February 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> Sichuan also possesses China's largest proven natural gas reserves, the majority of which is transported to more developed eastern regions.<ref name="bare_url" />

Sichuan is one of the major industrial centers of China. In addition to heavy industries such as coal, energy, iron and steel, the province has also established a light industrial sector comprising building materials, wood processing, food and silk processing. [[Chengdu]] and [[Mianyang]] are the production centers for textiles and electronics products. [[Deyang]], [[Panzhihua]], and [[Yibin]] are the production centers for machinery, metallurgical industries, and wine, respectively. Sichuan's wine production accounted for 21.9% of the country's total production in 2000.

Great strides have been made in developing Sichuan into a modern hi-tech industrial base, by encouraging both domestic and foreign investments in electronics and information technology (such as software), machinery and metallurgy (including automobiles), hydropower, pharmaceutical, food and beverage industries.

The auto industry is an important and key sector of the machinery industry in Sichuan. Most of the auto manufacturing companies are located in Chengdu, Mianyang, [[Nanchong]], and [[Luzhou]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr111906e.html |title=International Market Research – AUTO PARTS INDUSTRY IN SICHUAN AND CHONGQING |access-date=5 February 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626154234/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr111906e.html |archive-date=26 June 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Other important industries in Sichuan include [[aerospace]] and defense (military) industries. A number of China's rockets ([[Long March rocket]]s) and [[satellite]]s were launched from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]], located in the city of [[Xichang]].

Sichuan's landscapes and rich historical relics have also made the province a center for tourism.

The [[Three Gorges Dam]], the largest [[dam]] ever constructed, was built on the [[Yangtze River]] in nearby [[Hubei]] province to control flooding in the Sichuan Basin, neighboring [[Yunnan]] province, and downstream. The plan is hailed by some as China's efforts to shift towards alternative energy sources and to further develop its industrial and commercial bases, but others have criticised it for its potentially harmful effects, such as massive resettlement of residents in the reservoir areas, loss of archeological sites, and ecological damages.

Sichuan has one of the largest economy in western China. Its nominal GDP for 2017 was 3.69 trillion yuan (US$547.71 billion), equivalent to 44,651 RMB (US$6,613) per capita.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://data.stats.gov.cn/english/  |access-date=5 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614044850/http://data.stats.gov.cn/english/ |archive-date=14 June 2018 |url-status=live |title=National Data }}</ref> In 2008, the per capita net income of rural residents was 4,121 yuan (US$593), up 16.2% from 2007.

===Foreign trade===
According to the Sichuan Department of Commerce, the province's total foreign trade was US$22.04 billion in 2008, with an annual increase of 53.3 percent. Exports were US$13.1 billion, an annual increase of 52.3 percent, while imports were US$8.93 billion, an annual increase of 54.7 percent. These achievements were accomplished because of significant changes in China's foreign trade policy, acceleration of the yuan's appreciation, increase of commercial incentives and increase in production costs. The 18 cities and counties witnessed a steady rate of increase. Chengdu, Suining, Nanchong, Dazhou, Ya'an, Abazhou, and Liangshan all saw an increase of more than 40 percent while Leshan, Neijiang, Luzhou, Meishan, Ziyang, and Yibin saw an increase of more than 20 percent. Foreign trade in Zigong, Panzhihua, Guang'an, Bazhong and Ganzi remained constant.

===Minimum wage===
The Sichuan government raised the minimum wage in the province by 12.5 percent at the end of December 2007. The monthly minimum wage went up from 400 to 450 yuan, with a minimum of 4.9 yuan per hour for part-time work, effective 26 December 2007. The government also reduced the four-tier minimum wage structure to three. The top tier mandates a minimum of 650 yuan per month, or 7.1 yuan per hour. National law allows each province to set minimum wages independently, but with a floor of 450 yuan per month.

==Transportation==
[[File:卡萨湖.jpg|thumb|[[China National Highway 318|Sichuan–Tibet Highway]] passes by Lake Kasa in [[Luhuo County]].]]

For millennia, Sichuan's rugged and riverine landscape presented enormous challenges to the development of transportation infrastructure, and the lack of roads out of the Sichuan Basin contributed to the region's isolation. Since the 1950s, numerous highways and railways have been built through the Qinling in the north and the Bashan in the east. Dozens of bridges [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|across the Yangtze]] and its tributaries to the south and west have brought greater connectivity with Yunnan and Tibet.

===Airports===
[[Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport]] is the 4th-busiest airport in mainland China. It was among the world's top 30 busiest airports in 2015, and the busiest in western and central China. It was also the fifth-busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic in China for 2013. Chengdu airport is the hub of [[Sichuan Airlines]], [[Chengdu Airlines]], [[Shenzhen Airlines]], [[Tibet Airlines]], [[China Southern Airlines]], [[China Eastern Airlines]], [[Lucky Air]] and [[Air China]]. Alongside Shangliu Airport, [[Chengdu Tianfu International Airport]] is under construction.

Chengdu airports are also 144-hour transit visa-free airports for foreigners from many countries like Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Republic of Montenegro, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States.

===Expressways===
On 3 November 2007, the Sichuan Transportation Bureau announced that the [[G93 Chengyu Ring Expressway|Suining-Chongqing Expressway]] was completed after three years of construction. After completion of the Chongqing section of the road, the {{convert|36.64|km|abbr=on}} expressway connected [[G42 Shanghai–Chengdu Expressway|Chengdu-Nanchong Expressway]] and formed the shortest expressway from [[Chengdu]] to [[Chongqing]]. The new expressway is {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} shorter than the pre-existing road between Chengdu and Chongqing; thus journey time between the two cities was reduced by an hour, now taking two and a half hours. The Sui-Yu Expressway is a four lane overpass with a speed limit of {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}}. The total investment was 1.045 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]].

===Rail===
Major railways in Sichuan include the [[Baoji–Chengdu Railway|Baoji–Chengdu]], [[Chengdu–Chongqing Railway|Chengdu–Chongqing]], [[Chengdu–Kunming Railway|Chengdu–Kunming]], [[Neijiang–Kunming Railway|Neijiang–Kunming]], Suining-Chongqing and Chengdu–Dazhou Railways. A high-speed rail line [[Chengdu-Dujiangyan High-Speed Railway|connects Chengdu and Dujiangyan]].

The predominant religions in Sichuan are [[Chinese folk religion]]s, [[Taoism|Taoist traditions]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]]. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 10.6% of the population believes and is involved in [[Chinese ancestral religion|cults of ancestors]], while 0.68% of the population identifies as Christian.<ref name="Wang2015"/> According to the Japanese publication ''Tokyo Sentaku'' in 1999 there were 2 million members of [[Yiguandao]] (Tiandao) in Sichuan, equal to 2.4% of the province's population.<ref name=YiguandaoSichuan/>

The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; the vast majority of the population may be either irreligious or involved in [[Chinese folk religion|worship of nature deities]], Buddhism, [[Confucianism]], Taoism, [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]], and small minorities of [[Muslim]]s. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is widespread, especially in areas inhabited by ethnic Tibetans. Sichuan is one of the cradles of the early [[Zhengyi Taoism|Heavenly Masters' Taoist religious movements]].

The ''Sichuanese people'' ([[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]]: {{lang|zh|巴蜀人}} Ba<sup>1</sup>su<sup>2</sup>ren<sup>2</sup>; [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[pa˥su˨˩zən˨˩]}}; alternatively {{lang|zh|川人}}, {{lang|zh|川渝人}}, {{lang|zh|四川人}} or {{lang|zh|巴蜀民系}}) are a subgroup of Han Chinese living in mostly Sichuan province and the neighboring [[Chongqing]] municipality. Beginning from the 9th century BC, [[Shu (state)|Shu]] (on the [[Chengdu Plain]]) and [[Ba (state)|Ba]] (which had its first capital at [[Enshi City]] in [[Hubei]] and controlled part of the [[Han River (Shaanxi and Hubei)|Han Valley]]) emerged as cultural and administrative centers where two rival kingdoms were established. Although eventually the [[Qin dynasty]] destroyed the kingdoms of Shu and Ba, the Qin government accelerated the technological and agricultural advancements of Sichuan making it comparable to that of the [[Yellow River]] Valley. The now-extinct [[Ba-Shu Chinese|Ba-Shu language]] was derived from Qin-era settlers and represents the earliest documented division from what is now called [[Middle Chinese]].

During the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, the population of the area was reduced through wars and the [[bubonic plague]] and settlers arrived from the area of modern Hubei, replacing the earlier common Chinese with a new standard.

The [[Li Bai]] Memorial, located in [[Jiangyou]], is a museum in memory of Li Bai, a Chinese poet of [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] (618–907) built at the place where he grew up. Building was begun in 1962 on the occasion of 1200th anniversary of his death, completed in 1981 and opened to the public in October 1982. The memorial is built in the style of the classic Tang garden.

In 2003, Sichuan had "88 art performing troupes, 185 culture centers, 133 libraries and 52 museums". Companies based in Sichuan also produced 23 television series and one film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsgd.com/specials/panprdforum/deltadetails/200405260039.htm|title=Sichuan: Education and Culture|date=2004-05-26|accessdate=2014-01-04|publisher=newsgd.com|editor=Catherine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514051220/http://www.newsgd.com/specials/panprdforum/deltadetails/200405260039.htm|archive-date=14 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Languages===
{{Main|Sichuanese Mandarin|Ba-Shu Chinese}}
[[File:Sichuanese in China.png|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Extent of present-day Sichuanese language]]
The Sichuanese once spoke their own variety of Spoken Chinese called Ba-Shu Chinese, or Old Sichuanese, before it became extinct during the Ming dynasty. Now most of them speak Sichuanese Mandarin. The Minjiang dialects are thought by some linguists{{who|date=March 2019}} to be a bona fide descendant of Old Sichuanese, but there is no conclusive evidence whether Minjiang dialects are derived from Old Sichuanese or Southwestern Mandarin.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

The languages of Sichuan are primarily members of three subfamilies of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]].

The most widely used variety of Chinese spoken in Sichuan is [[Sichuanese Mandarin]], which is the [[lingua franca]] in Sichuan, [[Chongqing]] and parts of [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. Although Sichuanese is generally classified as a dialect of [[Mandarin Chinese]], it is highly divergent in phonology, vocabulary, and even grammar from [[Standard Chinese]].<ref name="《四川方言与巴蜀文化》">{{cite book |language=zh-hans |last1=Cui |first1=Rongchang (崔荣昌) |script-title=zh:《四川方言与巴蜀文化》 |year=1996 |publisher=[[Sichuan University]] Press |script-chapter=zh:第三章：四川的官话 |isbn=7-5614-1296-7}}</ref> The [[Minjiang dialect]] is especially difficult for speakers of other Mandarin dialects to understand.<ref>{{cite book |language=zh-hans |last1=Li |first1=Bin (李彬) |last2=Tu |first2=Minghua (涂鸣华) |script-title=zh:《百年中国新闻人（上册）》 |year=2007 |publisher=Fujian People's Press |page =563 |isbn=978-7-211-05482-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |language=zh-hans |script-title=zh:四川交通："窗口"飞来普通话 |last1=Wu |first1=Dan (吴丹) |last2=Liang |first2=Xiaoming (梁晓明) |script-work=zh:中国交通报 |date=23 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |language=zh-hans |script-title=zh:大学生村官恶补四川方言 现在能用流利四川话和村民交流 |last1=Zhang |first1=Guosheng (张国盛) |last2=Yu |first2=Yong (余勇) |newspaper=[[:zh:北京晨报|Morning Post]] |date=1 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |language=zh-hans |script-title=zh:走进大山的志愿者 |script-work=zh:四川青年报 |trans-work=Sichuan Youth Paper |date=18 July 2009}}</ref>

[[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] and [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]] in western Sichuan are populated by [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] and [[Qiang people]]. Tibetans speak the [[Khams Tibetan|Khams]] and [[Amdo Tibetan]], which are [[Tibetic languages]], as well as various [[Qiangic languages]]. The Qiang speak Qiangic languages and often Tibetic languages as well. The [[Yi people]] of [[Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture]] in southern Sichuan speak the [[Nuosu language]], which is one of the [[Lolo-Burmese languages]]; Yi is written using the [[Yi script]], a [[syllabary]] standardized in 1974. The [[Southwest University for Nationalities]] has one of China's most prominent [[Tibetology]] departments, and the Southwest Minorities Publishing House prints literature in minority languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tibetinfonet.net/content/update/143#fn2|title=The Wuhou District (武侯区), a Tibetan enclave in Chengdu|date=2009-03-24|accessdate=2013-01-04|issn=1864-1407|publisher=TibetInfoNet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105045511/http://www.tibetinfonet.net/content/update/143#fn2|archive-date=5 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In the minority-inhabited regions of Sichuan, there is bilingual signage and public school instruction in non-Mandarin minority languages.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Sichuan cuisine}}
Sichuan is well known for its spicy cuisine and use of [[Sichuan pepper]]s due to its more humid climate.
The Sichuanese are proud of their cuisine, known as one of the Four Great Traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]]. The cuisine here is of "one dish, one shape, hundreds of dishes, hundreds of tastes", as the saying goes, to describe its acclaimed diversity. The most prominent traits of Sichuanese cuisine are described by four words: spicy, hot, fresh and fragrant.<ref>[http://www.5hpk.com/WebUI/InfoDir/pTopicTagSearch.html?SiteId=Whpk&DirId=ys&MainClassId=ys&tag=%u5DDD%u83DC Sichuanese Cuisine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720061416/http://www.5hpk.com/WebUI/InfoDir/pTopicTagSearch.html?SiteId=Whpk&DirId=ys&MainClassId=ys&tag=%u5DDD%u83DC |date=20 July 2008 }} {{in lang|zh}} – Pictures, descriptions, history, and examples of Sichuan cuisine.</ref> Sichuan cuisine is popular in the whole nation of China, so are Sichuan chefs. Two well-known Sichuan chefs are [[Chen Kenmin]] and his son [[Chen Kenichi]], who was Iron Chef Chinese on the Japanese television series "[[Iron Chef]]".

Another famous Sichuan cuisine is hotpot. Hot pot is a Chinese soup containing a variety of East Asian foodstuffs and ingredients, prepared with a simmering pot of soup stock at the dining table. While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leaf vegetables, mushrooms, wontons, egg dumplings, tofu, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a dipping sauce.
