'''''Angela Merkel – The Unexpected''''' is a 2016 documentary film directed by Torsten Körner and Matthias Schmidt. The television premier on [[Arte]] was on 6 December 2016.

== Synopsis ==
''Angela Merkel - The Unexpected'' tells the story of [[Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel|Merkel]]’s unexpected rise to power – from an East German physicist to the most powerful woman in the world. The film takes a look at her biography from when she entered the political stage in 1989 to the present. A second focus is put on the [[European migrant crisis|refugee crisis]] and establishes the connection between Merkel’s actions and her biography. Political and personal companions who have witnessed the chancellor throughout the years comment on her childhood in [[East Germany]], her first political steps, her rise to the top, her eventful chancellorship, and the current political situation she is facing. In an exclusive interview, [[Angela Merkel]] herself reflects on her life in the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]], comparing it to her life after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], her unexpected and unprecedented career, the [[refugee crisis]], and finally on herself as a politician, a motivator, or a listener.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Patricia|last1=Smagge|title=Angela Merkel: The Unexpected – Angela Merkel – Die Unerwartete (2016) (In Dutch)|url=https://cinemagazine.nl/angela-merkel-the-unexpected-angela-merkel-die-unerwartete-2016-recensie/|website=cinemagazine.nl|accessdate=2017-09-20|date=2016}}</ref>
