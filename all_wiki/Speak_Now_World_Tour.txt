===Arm lyrics===
[[File:Taylor Swift (6820735620).jpg|thumb|right|140px|Swift performing during the Speak Now World Tour in 2012 with lyrics from [[Natasha Bedingfield]]'s "[[Neon Lights (Natasha Bedingfield song)|Neon Lights]]" on her arm|alt=Taylor Swift performing live. The quote on her arm reads "Go cut through the noise so you can know what love sounds like".]]

During the North American and Australasian tour legs, Swift wrote different song lyrics, and occasionally quotes from famous speeches and movies, on her left arm for each performance. She has said that the lyrics should be viewed as a nightly "mood ring"<ref>{{cite web |author=Becca |url=http://www.thecountryvibe.com/Blog1/?p=14366 |title=Taylor Swift's Arm Art is a Mood Ring&nbsp;– The Country Vibe News |publisher=Thecountryvibe.com |date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=May 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807040552/http://www.thecountryvibe.com/Blog1/?p=14366 |archive-date=August 7, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and ''The New Yorker'' has cited the practice as an example of Swift's "keen understanding of what fuels fan obsession in the first place: a desire for intimacy between singer and listener".<ref name="widdicombe1">{{cite news|last=Widdicombe|first=Lizzie|title=You Belong With Me|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_widdicombe?currentPage=all|accessdate=October 11, 2011|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=October 10, 2011}}</ref>

===Acoustic cover versions===
Swift performed many acoustic cover versions during her North American tour. In each city, she paid tribute to a homegrown artist.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perpetua|first=Matthew|title=Videos: Taylor Swift's Coast-to-Coast Cover Songs|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/photos/videos-taylor-swifts-coast-to-coast-cover-songs-20111116|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> She has said the cover versions allowed her to be "spontaneous" in an otherwise well-rehearsed show: "You'll have a lot of people who will come to more than one show, and I want them to get a different experience every time."<ref>{{cite web|last=Roland|first=Tom|title=Taylor Swift: Billboard's Woman of the Year|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/taylor-swift-billboard-s-woman-of-the-year-1005603662.story#/news/taylor-swift-billboard-s-woman-of-the-year-1005603662.story?page=2|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=2|accessdate=May 15, 2012|date=December 2, 2011}}</ref>
