[[Historic counties of England|Historically]], the south of the Tees was in the [[North Riding]] of [[Yorkshire]]. Middlesbrough became a "[[county borough]]" outside its [[shire]] in 1889. In 1968, the local area was merged into a [[county borough of Teesside]]. This was, in 1974, merged into the [[county of Cleveland]], [[Middlesbrough Council]] became unitary at this point. In 1996 Cleveland was abolished.

''Erimus'' ("We shall be" in [[Latin]]) is Middlesbrough's motto, chosen in 1830. It reflect ''Fuimus'' ("We have been") the motto of the Norman/Scottish [[Bruce clan]], lords of [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]] in the Middle Ages. The town's [[coat of arms]] is an azure lion, from the arms of the Bruce family, a star, from the arms of [[Captain James Cook]], and two ships, representing its founding for shipbuilding and maritime trade.<ref>{{cite web |title=Middlesbrough Borough Council |url=http://civicheraldry.co.uk/tweed_tyne_tees.html#middlesbrough%20bc |publisher=Civic Heraldry of England and Wales}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
{{further|Middlesbrough# Middlehaven}}
A monastic cell was consecrated by [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St. Cuthbert]], in 686, at the request of the Abbess of [[Whitby]]. "Mydilsburgh" is the earliest recorded form of Middlesbrough's name. 

After the [[Anglo-Saxons|Angles]], the area became home to [[Viking]] settlers. Names of Viking origin (with the suffix ''by'') are abundant in the area – for example, [[Ormesby]], Stainsby and [[Tollesby]] were once separate villages that belonged to [[Vikings]] called Orm, Steinn and Toll, but now form suburbs of Middlesbrough are recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086.  Other names around Middlesbrough include the village of [[Maltby, North Yorkshire|Maltby]] (of Malti) along with the towns of [[Ingleby Barwick]] (Anglo-place and barley-wick) and [[Thornaby]] (of Thormod).

In 1119 [[Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale|Robert Bruce, Lord of Cleveland and Annandale]], granted and confirmed the church of St. Hilda of Middleburg to Whitby.<ref name="auto5">{{cite web |title=Welcome to Middlesbrough |url=http://www.middlesbroughuk.co.uk/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006053142/http://www.middlesbroughuk.co.uk/ |archive-date=6 October 2006 |access-date=12 March 2011}}</ref>

Links persist in the area, often through school or road names, to now-outgrown or abandoned local settlements, such as the [[medieval]] settlement of Stainsby, [[deserted medieval village|deserted]] by 1757, which amounts to little more today than a series of grassy mounds near the [[A19 road]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Stainsby Medieval Village |url=http://www.teesarchaeology.com/projects/stainsby/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513114527/http://www.teesarchaeology.com/projects/stainsby/index.html |archive-date=13 May 2012 |access-date=20 December 2007 |publisher=Tees Archaeology}}</ref>

===Development===
[[File:Old Middlesbrough Town Hall 2013.jpg|right|thumb|Old Town Hall]]
In 1801, Middlesbrough was a small farm with a population of just 25. During the latter half of the 19th century, however, it experienced rapid growth.

In 1829, S&DR shareholder, [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] and a group of Quaker businessmen bought the Middlesbrough farmstead, included in some {{convert|527|acre}} of land, and established the Middlesbrough Estate Company, developed coal port on the banks of the Tees and a suitable town on the site of the farm (the new town of Middlesbrough) to supply the port with labour, laid out in a grid-iron pattern around a market square, the first house built on West Street in April 1830.<ref name="auto2">{{cite web |title=Middlesbrough |url=http://www.billyscarrow.co.uk/middlesbrough.htm |access-date=4 July 2015 |publisher=Billy Scarrow}}</ref> The town of Middlesbrough was born.<ref name="auto3">{{cite web |title=Middlesbrough and surrounds: The Birth of Middlesbrough |url=https://englandsnortheast.co.uk/middlesbrough/ |access-date=18 October 2014 |publisher=England's North East}}</ref> By 1851 Middlesbrough's population had grown from 40 people in 1829 to 7,600.<ref name="englandsnortheast.co.uk">{{cite web |title=Middlesbrough and surrounds: The Birth of Middlesbrough |url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/Middlesbrough.html |access-date=19 February 2015 |website=englandsnortheast |publisher=David Simpson}}</ref>

===Industrialisation===
{{further|Bolckow Vaughan|Dorman Long|Teesside Steelworks}}
[[File:Ironopolis wall.JPG|right|thumb|A wall celebrating the name Ironopolis]]
Iron and steel have dominated the Tees area since 1841 when [[Henry Bolckow]] in partnership with [[John Vaughan (ironmaster)|John Vaughan]], founded the Vulcan [[iron foundry]] and [[rolling mill]]. Vaughan, who had worked his way up through the Iron industry in South Wales, used his technical expertise to find a more abundant supply of [[Ironstone]] in the [[Eston Nab|Eston Hills]] in 1850, and introduced the new "Bell Hopper" system of closed blast furnaces developed at the [[Ebbw Vale]] works. These factors made the works an unprecedented success with Teesside becoming known as the "Iron-smelting centre of the world" and [[Bolckow, Vaughan|Bolckow, Vaughan & Co., Ltd]] became the largest company in existence.<ref name=ICE>Institution of Civil Engineers, ''Obituary'', 1869.</ref>

By 1851 Middlesbrough's population had grown from 40 people in 1829 to 7,600.<ref name="englandsnortheast.co.uk"/> [[Pig iron]] production rose tenfold between 1851 and 1856 and by the mid 1870s Middlesbrough was producing one third of the entire nations Pig Iron output. It was during this time Middlesbrough earned the nickname "Ironopolis".<ref>{{cite news |date=23 February 1870 |title=Middlesbrough has sometimes been designated the Ironopolis of the North |work=[[The Northern Echo]]}}</ref><ref name="Ballarat">{{cite journal |date=Spring 2004 |title=Middlesbrough never ceased to be Ironopolis |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=37 |issue=3 |page=746}}</ref>

On 21 January 1853, Middlesbrough received its [[Royal Charter|Royal Charter of Incorporation]],<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Cleveland Police |url=http://www.cleveland.police.uk/about-us/History.aspx |access-date=3 April 2011}}</ref> giving the town the right to have a mayor, aldermen and councillors. Henry Bolckow became mayor, in 1853.<ref name="page" />

In 1864, a hospital, the North Riding Infirmary, opened in Newport Road. Henry Bolckow died in 1878 and left an endowment of £5,000 for the infirmary.<ref name="page" />

On 15 August 1867, a Reform Bill was passed, making Middlesbrough a new parliamentary borough, Bolckow was elected member for Middlesbrough the following year.

In 1875, Bolckow, Vaughan & Co opened the Cleveland Steelworks in Middlesbrough beginning the transition from Iron production to Steel and by the turn of the century, [[Teesside]] had become one of the major steel centres in the country and possibly the world. In 1900, [[Bolckow Vaughan|Bolckow, Vaughan & Co]] had become the largest producer of steel in Great Britain. In 1914, [[Dorman Long]], another major steel producer from Middlesbrough, became the largest company in Britain, employing a workforce of over 20,000, and by 1929 it was the dominant steel producer on Teesside after taking over Bolckow, Vaughan & Co and acquiring its assets. It was possibly the largest Steel producer in Britain at the time. The steel components of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] (1932) were engineered and fabricated by [[Dorman Long]] of Middlesbrough. The company was also responsible for the [[Tyne Bridge|New Tyne Bridge]] in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref name="DLong201407">{{cite web |title=Dorman Long Historical Information |url=http://www.dormanlongtechnology.com/en/Dorman%20Long%20historical%20information.htm |access-date=14 July 2014 |publisher=dormanlongtechnology.com}}</ref>

Several large shipyards also lined the Tees, including the [[Sir Raylton Dixon|Sir Raylton Dixon & Company]], which produced hundreds of steam freighters including the infamous [[SS Mont-Blanc]], the steamship which caused the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion]] in Canada.

Middlesbrough's rapid expansion continued throughout the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century (fuelled by the iron and steel industry), the population reaching 90,000 by the turn of the century.<ref name="englandsnortheast.co.uk" /> The population of Middlesbrough as a county borough peaked at almost 165,000 in the late 1960s, but has declined since the early 1980s. The 2011 Census recorded the borough's total resident population as 138,400 and the urban settlement as 174,500.

===Welsh migration to Middlesbrough===
[[File:John Vaughan statue Middlesbrough.jpg|thumb|right|The monument to [[John Vaughan (ironmaster)|John Vaughan]]. The inscription names him as 'founder of the iron trade in Middlesbrough'.]]

A Welsh community was established in Middlesbrough sometime before the 1840s, with mining being the main form of employment.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leatherdale |first1=Duncan |title=We are Middlesbrough: Where and What is it? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-48024370 |work=BBC News |date=18 May 2019|accessdate=12 October 2020}}</ref> This Welsh population grew rapidly after 1841 when [[John Vaughan (ironmaster)|John Vaughan]] established the first ironworks on Teesside (The Vulcan Works) at Middlesbrough.<ref name=ICE/> Vaughan had worked his way up through the industry at the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] in south Wales and encouraged hundreds of skilled workers to follow him to Teesside.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=David |title=A History of Modern Wales |date=1950 |location=London |page=220 }}</ref> These migrants included three figures who would became important leaders in the commercial, political and cultural life of the town:

*[[Edward Williams (iron-master)]], although he was the grandson of the famous Welsh [[Bard]] [[Iolo Morganwg]], Edward had started as a mere clerk at Dowlais. His move to the Tees saw him rise to ironmaster, alderman, magistrate and Mayor of Middlesbrough. Edward was also the father of [[Aneurin Williams|Aneurin]] and [[Penry Williams|Penry]], who both became [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MPs for the area.<ref>{{cite web |title=WILLIAMS, EDWARD (1826–1886), iron-master |url=https://biography.wales/article/s-WILL-EDW-1826 |website=Dictionary of Welsh biography |accessdate=12 October 2020}}</ref>
*[[Edward John (British politician)|E.T. John]] Arrived from Pontypridd as a junior clerk in Williams' office. John became the director of several industrial enterprises and a radical politician.<ref>{{cite web |title=JOHN, EDWARD THOMAS (1857–1931), industrialist and politician |url=https://biography.wales/article/s-JOHN-THO-1857?&query=edward%20john&searchType=nameSearch&lang[]=en&sort=sort_name&order=asc&rows=12&page=1 |website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography |accessdate=12 October 2020}}</ref>

Much like the contemporary [[Welsh Americans|Welsh migration to America]], the Welsh of Middlesbrough came almost exclusively from the iron-smelting and coal districts of South Wales.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pooley |first=C.

D.|last2= Whyte |title=Migrants, Emigrants and Immigrants: A Social History of Migration |date=1991 |location=London |pages=152–168}}</ref> By 1861 42% of the town's ironworkers identified as Welsh and one in twenty of the total population.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=B.

D. |title=Ironmasters and Ironworkers |journal=Cleveland Iron and Steel: Background and Nineteenth Century History |date=1979 |page=238}}</ref> Place names such as "Welch Cottages" and "Welch Place" appeared around the Vulcan works, and Middlesbrough became a centre for Welsh communities at, [[Witton Park]], [[Spennymoor]], [[Consett]] and [[Stockton on Tees]] (especially [[Portrack]]). [[David Williams (historian)|David Williams]] also recorded that a number of the Welsh workers at the [[Hughesovka]] Ironworks in 1869 had migrated from Middlesbrough.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=David |title=A History of Modern Wales |date=1950 |location=London |page=221 }}</ref>

====Impact on Middlesbrough culture====
{{quote box|

''"It was delightful to him, to come again to that portion of Wales, called North East England, and meet once again so many of his old friends."''

|source='Address to The Cleveland and Durham Eisteddfod', North Eastern Daily Gazette.

|align=left|width=40%}}

A Welsh Baptist chapel was active in the town as early as 1858, and St Hilda's Anglican church began providing services in the Welsh language. Churches and chapels were also centres for Welsh culture, supporting choirs, Sunday Schools, social societies, adult education, lectures and literary meetings. Many more chapels were built (one reputed to seat 500 people) across the town, and the first [[Eisteddfodau]] were held by the 1870s.<ref name="auto4">{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Lewis |first2=David |last2=Ward |title=Culture, Politics and Assimilation: The Welsh on Teesside, c.1850–1940 |journal=Welsh History Review Cylchgrawn Hanes Cymru. |date=1994–1995 |volume=17 |issue=1–4 |pages=551–570 |url=https://journals.library.wales/view/1073091/1082250/582#?xywh=889%2C203%2C958%2C850 }}</ref>

By the 1880s, a "Welsh cultural revival" was underway with Eisteddfodau becoming open events, attracting competitors and crowds from the Non-Welsh communities. In 1890 the [[Town Hall|Middlesbrough Town Hall]] hosted the first ''Cleveland and Durham Eisteddfod'', an event notable for its non-denominational inclusivity, with Irish Catholic choirs and the bishop of the newly created [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Middlesbrough]] as honoured guests.<ref name="auto4"/>

In the early twentieth century this Eisteddfod had become the biggest annual event in the town and the largest annual Eisteddfod outside Wales. The Eisteddfod had a clear impact on the culture of the town, especially through its literary and music events, by 1911 the Eisteddfod had twenty-two classes of musical competition with only two for Welsh language content. By 1914, thirty choirs from across the area were competing in 284 entries.<ref>{{cite book |last1=John |first1=E. T. |title=Programme and Prize list, 1911 Cleveland and Durham Eisteddfod |date=1911 |location=Middlesbrough}}</ref> A choral tradition remained part of the town's culture long after the eisteddfod and chapels had gone. In 2012 an exhibition at the [[Dorman Museum]] marked the Apollo Male Voice Choir's 125 years as an active choir in the town.<ref>{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough's Apollo Male Voice Choir marks 125 years |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-17274766 |work=BBC News |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2020}}</ref>

====In Politics====

Wales was noted for its "radical Liberal-Labour" politics, and the rhetoric of these politicians clearly won favour with the urban population of the North East. [[Penry Williams]] and [[Jonathan Samuel]] won the seats of [[Middlesbrough (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesbrough]] and [[Stockton-on-Tees (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockton-on-Tees]] for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and Penry's brother, [[Aneurin Williams|Aneurin]] would also win the newly created [[Consett (UK Parliament constituency)|Consett]] seat in 1918.<ref name="auto4"/>

[[Horace Davey, Baron Davey|Sir Horace Davey]] stressed his Welsh lineage and stated that "it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that Welshmen had founded Middlesbrough", courting the Welsh vote that saw him elected MP for Stockton. However, others complained that local Conservative candidates were losing to "Fenians and Welshers" (Irish and Welsh people).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wrightson |first1=J. B. |title=The Life of Thomas Wrightson |date=1939 |page=90}}</ref><ref name="auto4"/>

These sentiments had grown by 1900 when Samuel lost his seat after a Unionist complained publicly that the town had been "forced to submit to the indignity of being trailed ignominiously through the mire by Welsh constituents". Samuel lost the seat but regained it in 1910 with a campaign that made few, if any, references to his Welsh background.<ref name="auto4"/>

An identifiably Welsh population declined during the inter-war period. With the cessation of migration to the area from Wales, the Welsh chapels struggled to maintain their outgoings. By the 1930s, many of the Welsh Chapels had closed and the Eisteddfod had ended as an annual event.

===Irish migration to Middlesbrough===
{{main|Irish migration to Great Britain}} 
From 1861 to 1871, the census of England & Wales showed that Middlesbrough consistently had the second highest percentage of [[Irish people|Irish]] born people in England after Liverpool.<ref name="two">{{cite web |last1=Fennell |first1=Barbara |last2=Jones |first2=Mark J |last3=Llamas |first3=Carmen |title=Middlesbrough – A study into Irish immigration and influence on the Middlesbrough dialect |url=http://www.slideshare.net/mrudigawa/middlesbrough}}</ref><ref name="three">{{cite book |last=Yasumoto |first=Minoru |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ji3lYsG6AwC&pg=PA66 |title=The Rise of a Victorian Ironopolis: Middlesbrough and Regional Industrialization |year=2011 |isbn=9781843836339}}</ref> The Irish population in 1861 accounted for 15.6% of the total population of Middlesbrough. In 1871 the amount had dropped to 9.2% yet this still placed Middlesbrough's Irish population second in England behind Liverpool.<ref name="four">{{cite book |last1=Swift |first1=Roger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6PwHF6FUYUC&pg=PA67 |title=The Irish in Britain, 1815–1939 |last2=Gilley |first2=Sheridan |year=1989 |isbn=9780389208884}}</ref> Due to the rapid development of the town and its industrialisation there was much need for people to work in the many blast furnaces and steel works along the banks of the Tees. This attracted many people from Ireland, who were in much need of work. As well as people from Ireland, the [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and overseas inhabitants made up 16% of Middlesbrough's population in 1871.<ref name="three" /> A second influx of Irish migration was observed in the early 1900s as Middlesbrough's steel industry boomed producing 1/3 of Britain's total steel output. This second influx lasted through to the 1950s after which Irish migration to Middlesbrough saw a drastic decline. Middlesbrough no longer has a strong Irish presence, with Irish born residents making up around 2% of the current population, however there is still a strong cultural and historical connection with Ireland mainly through the heritage and ancestry of many families within Middlesbrough.

===Second World War===
{{main|Middlesbrough during World War II}}
Middlesbrough was the first major British town and industrial target to be bombed during the [[Second World War]]. The steel making capacity and railways for carrying steel products were obvious targets. The [[Luftwaffe]] first bombed the town on 25 May 1940, when a lone bomber dropped 13 bombs between South Bank Road and the South Steel plant.<ref>{{cite news |date=September 2010 |title=Remembering the Blitz |work=Evening Gazette |publisher=Trinity Mirror |url=http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2010/09/remembering-the-blitz.html}}</ref> More bombing occurred throughout the course of the war, with the [[Middlesbrough railway station|railway station]] put out of action for two weeks in 1942.<ref>{{cite news |date=April 2010 |title=Middlesbrough Railway Station bombed 1942 |work=Evening Gazette |publisher=Trinity Mirror |url=http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2010/04/middlesbrough-railway-station.html}}</ref>

By the end of the war over 200 buildings had been destroyed within the Middlesbrough area. Areas of early and mid-Victorian housing were demolished and much of central Middlesbrough was redeveloped. Heavy industry was relocated to areas of land better suited to the needs of modern technology. Middlesbrough itself began to take on a completely different look.<ref>{{cite web |date=4 August 1942 |title=Middlesbrough 1940s |url=http://www.billmilner.250x.com/mbro40.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202051719/http://www.billmilner.250x.com/mbro40.html |archive-date=2 December 2008 |access-date=4 September 2011 |publisher=Billmilner.250x.com}}</ref>

The [[Green Howards]] was a [[British Army]] infantry regiment very strongly associated with Middlesbrough and the area south of the River Tees. Originally formed at [[Dunster Castle]], [[Somerset]] in 1688 to serve King William of Orange, later [[William III of England|King William III]], this famous regiment became affiliated to the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1782. As Middlesbrough grew, its population of men came to be a group most targeted by the recruiters. The Green Howards were part of the [[King's Division]]. On 6 June 2006, this famous regiment was merged into the new [[Yorkshire Regiment]] and are now known as 2 Yorks – The 2nd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards). There is also a [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) company at Stockton Road in Middlesbrough, part of 4 Yorks which is wholly reserve.

Middlesbrough was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1853. It extended its boundaries in 1866 and 1887, and became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. A [[Middlesbrough Rural District]] was formed in 1894, covering a rural area to the south of the town. It was abolished in 1932, partly going to the county borough; but mostly going to the [[Stokesley Rural District]].<ref>Youngs, Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Volume 2</ref>

[[File:Middscourt38.JPG |thumb|250px|Teesside Crown Court]]
In 1968 Middlesbrough became part of the [[County Borough of Teesside]], and in 1974 it became part of the non-metropolitan county of [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]] until the county's abolition in 1996, when Middlesbrough became a [[unitary authority]]. The town now forms part of [[North Yorkshire]] for ceremonial purposes.

=== Politics ===
Currently the [[Middlesbrough (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesbrough constituency]] is represented by [[Andy McDonald (politician)|Andy McDonald]] for Labour in the House of Commons. He was elected in a [[2012 Middlesbrough by-election|by-election]] held on 29 November 2012 following the death of previous Member of Parliament [[Stuart Bell|Sir Stuart Bell]], who was the MP since 1983. Middlesbrough has been a traditionally safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat. The first Conservative MP for Middlesbrough was Sir [[Samuel Alexander Sadler]], elected in 1900.

Meanwhile, the [[Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland]] constituency is represented by [[Simon Clarke (politician)|Simon Clarke]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], who won the seat off Labour in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]]. Prior to Clarke's election, the seat had always been Labour since it was created in 1997.

===Climate===
Middlesbrough has an [[oceanic climate]] typical for the United Kingdom.
Being sheltered from prevailing south-westerly winds by both the [[Lake District]] and [[Pennines]] to the west and the [[Cleveland Hills]] to the south, Middlesbrough is in one of the relatively drier parts of the country, receiving on average {{convert|574|mm|in|abbr=off}} of rain a year. Temperatures range from mild summer highs in July and August typically around {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to winter lows in December and January falling to around {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

==Demography==
In 2011, Middlesbrough had a population of 174,700,<ref name="Census2011" /> which makes it the largest town in [[North East England]] and largest urban [[Human settlement|settlement]] within the ceremonial county of [[North Yorkshire]]. The borough had a population of 138,412 at the same census. For comparison, the Built-up area sub-division (BUASD) is about the same size as [[Bournemouth]], the largest town in [[South West England]]. Middlesbrough town is larger than the borough. The town is made up of the borough, as well as the suburbs which make up the area known as [[Greater Eston]], which is to the east of the borough in [[Redcar and Cleveland]]. Greater Eston does not have a very high ethnic minority population, which makes the town more indigenous than the smaller borough.

In the borough of Middlesbrough, 14.0% of the population were non-white British, compared with only 11.6% for the town. This makes the town about as ethnically diverse as [[Exeter]]. Additionally, it has a lower indigenous population than [[Gateshead]] and [[South Shields]] which are further north on the other side of [[County Durham]]. It is also the second most ethnically diverse settlement in the North East (after Newcastle). The settlement of Middlesbrough is not coterminus with the council area and is recognised as a Built-up area sub-division (BUASD) of [[Teesside]] by the [[Office for National Statistics]].<ref name="auto" />

The area is still home to the nearby large [[Wilton International|Wilton International industrial site]] which until 1995 was largely owned by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI). The fragmentation of that company led to smaller manufacturing units being owned by multinational organisations. The last part of ICI itself completely left the area in 2006 and the remaining companies are now members of the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] (NEPIC).

[[Teesport]], owned by [[PD Ports]], is a major contributor to the economy of Middlesbrough and the port owners have their offices in the town. The port is {{convert|1|mi|0}} from the [[North Sea]] and {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of Middlesbrough, on the [[River Tees]]. It currently handles over 4,350 vessels each year and around 27 million tonnes of cargo with the estate covering approximately 779 acres.<ref>{{cite news |date=22 March 2019 |title=PD Ports: Teesport |work=PD Ports |publisher=PD Ports Website |url=https://www.pdports.co.uk/our-locations/teesport/}}</ref> Steel, petrochemical, agribulks, manufacturing, engineering and high street commerce operations are all supported through Teesport, in addition to the renewable energy sector – in both production and assembly facilities.

Middlesbrough also remains a stronghold for engineering based manufacturing and engineering contract service businesses. To help support this, the new TeesAMP advanced manufacturing park is designed to accommodate businesses associated with advanced manufacturing and emerging technologies.<ref>{{cite news |date=22 March 2019 |title=TeesAMP: Tees Advanced Manufacturing Park |publisher=TeesAMP Website |url=http://www.teesamp.co.uk/}}</ref> Announced in September 2020, TeesAMP will be the location of the UK's first hydrogen transport centre.<ref>{{cite news |date=30 September 2020 |title=Teesside to be clean energy leader and home of UK's first hydrogen transport centre |work=The Northern Echo |url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/18757094.teesside-clean-energy-leader-home-uks-first-hydrogen-transport-centre/|accessdate=16 October 2020}}</ref>

The university campus has benefited from approx £250&nbsp;million of investment in recent years, including the £30&nbsp;million Campus Heart scheme. Teesside University supports a total of 2,570 full-time jobs across the Tees Valley, North East and UK economies per annum. The university contributes additional wealth to the local, regional and national economies as measured by Gross Value Added (GVA). It is estimated this contributes a total of £124&nbsp;million GVA per annum. The total direct, indirect and induced spending impacts associated with full-time international students and UK students from outside of the North East is approximately £18.9&nbsp;million per annum. It is estimated this spending supports 158 full-time jobs per annum in Tees Valley and contributes additional wealth of £9.3&nbsp;million per annum to the local economy.<ref>{{cite news |date=2 February 2017 |title=Middlesbrough Council Invest Brochure 2 |publisher=Middlesbrough Borough Council |url=https://middlesbrough.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Investment_brochure_21-02-17.pdf}}</ref>

The South Tees NHS Trust, in particular [[James Cook University Hospital]], is also major employer. In addition it adds to the economy through innovative projects such as South Tees bio-incubator. This is a new hub which acts as a launch-pad for research, innovation and collaboration between health, technology and science. It is a facility used by GlycoSeLect (UK) Ltd. as a client of South Tees NHS Trust in strategic partnership with The Northern Health Science Alliance which has contributed £10.8&nbsp;billion to the UK economy.<ref>{{cite news |date=11 February 2018 |title=Innovation – South Tees bio-incubator |publisher=South Tees Hospitals |url=https://www.southtees.nhs.uk/about/teaching/research/innovation-south-tees-bio-incubator/}}</ref>

The terraced [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] streets surrounding the town centre are characterful elements of Middlesbrough's social and historical identity, and the vast streets surrounding Parliament Road and Abingdon Road a reminder of the area's wealth and rapid growth during industrialisation.

[[Middlesbrough Town Hall]], designed by [[George Gordon Hoskins]] and built between 1883 and 1889 is a Grade&nbsp;II [[listed building]], and a imposing structure of the town. Of comparable grandeur, is the Empire Palace of Varieties, of 1897, the finest surviving theatre edifice designed by Ernest Runtz in the UK. The first artist to star there in its guise as a [[music hall]] was [[Lillie Langtry]].<ref>{{cite web |date=18 November 2005 |title=The palace of varieties |url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/the-palace-of-varieties-3786783 |access-date=12 July 2019 |website=gazettelive}}</ref> Later it became an early nightclub (1950s), then a bingo hall and is now once again a nightclub. Further afield, in Linthorpe, is the [[Middlesbrough Theatre]] opened by Sir [[John Gielgud]] in 1957; it was one of the first new theatres built in England after the [[Second World War]].

The town includes the UK's only public sculpture by [[Claes Oldenburg]],<ref>{{cite news |date=2 October 2013 |title=Middlesbrough Bottle of Notes anniversary exhibition opens |publisher=BBC News Website |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-24348143}}</ref> the "Bottle O' Notes" of 1993, which relates to [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]]. Based alongside it today in the town's Central Gardens is the [[Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art]] (MIMA). 

The Dorman Long office on Zetland Road, constructed between 1881 and 1891, is the only commercial building ever designed by [[Philip Webb]], the architect who worked for Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell.

Away from the town centre, at Middlehaven stands the [[Tees Valley Giants|Temenos]] sculpture, designed by sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] and designer [[Cecil Balmond]]. The steel structure, consisting of a pole, a circular ring and an oval ring, stands approximately 110&nbsp;m long and 50&nbsp;m high and is held together by steel wire. It was unveiled in 2010 at a cost of £2.7&nbsp;million.

==Culture and community==
Middlesbrough Leisure Park is located at the eastern edge of the town centre. The leisure park hosts restaurants, a Cineworld multiplex cinema, fast food outlets, an American Golf outlet and a gym.<ref>{{cite news |date=22 March 2019 |title=Love Middlesbrough: Middlesbrough Leisure Park |publisher=Middlesbrough Council Website |url=http://lovemiddlesbrough.com/venues/middlesbrough-leisure-park}}</ref>

Middlesbrough also has a healthy musical heritage. A number of bands and musicians hail from the area, including [[Paul Rodgers]], [[Chris Rea]], and [[Micky Moody]].

====Early 1800s: Town Centre====
In 1801, Middlesbrough was a small farm with a population of just 25. The [[Stockton and Darlington Railway|Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR)]] had been developed to transport coal from [[Witton Park Colliery]] and {{stnlnk|Shildon}} in County Durham, to the [[River Tees]] in the east. It had always been assumed by the investors that {{stnlnk|Stockton|County Durham}} as the then lowest bridging point on the River Tees would be suitable to take the largest ships at the required volume. As trade developed, competition arose ([[Clarence Railway]]) in the form of a new port, [[Port Clarence]].

In 1828 the influential [[Quaker]] banker, coal mine owner and S&DR shareholder [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] sailed up the River Tees to find a suitable new site downriver of Stockton on which to place new coal [[staithe]]s. As a result, in 1829 he and a group of Quaker businessmen bought the Middlesbrough farmstead and associated estate, some {{convert|527|acre}} of land, and established the Middlesbrough Estate Company. Through the company, the investors set about the development of a new coal port on the banks of the Tees nearby designed by [[John Harris (railway engineer)|John Harris]], and a suitable town on the site of the farm (the new town of Middlesbrough) to supply the port with labour. By 1830 the S&DR had been extended to Middlesbrough, helping to expand it further. 

The small farmstead became the site of such streets as North Street, South Street, West Street, East Street, Commercial Street, Stockton Street and Cleveland Street, laid out in a grid-iron pattern around a market square, with the first house being built on West Street in April 1830.<ref name="auto2"/> The town of Middlesbrough was born.<ref name="auto3"/> New businesses bought premises and plots of land in the new town including: shippers, merchants, butchers, innkeepers, joiners, blacksmiths, tailors, builders and painters were moving in.

The first coal shipping staithes at the port (known as "Port Darlington") were constructed just to the west of the site earmarked for the location of Middlesbrough.<ref name=GazDock/><ref>{{cite web |title=The Archives: History of Middlehaven |url=http://www.mbro.ac.uk/Home/index/collegeinfo/collegehistory/middlehaven.aspx |access-date=20 November 2015 |publisher=Middlesbrough College}}</ref> The port was linked to the S&DR on 27 December 1830 via a branch that extended to an area just north of the current {{stnlnk|Middlesbrough}} railway station.<ref>{{cite web |title=December 1861 map of Middlesbrough North Riding: A Vision of Britain Through Time |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/25079 |access-date=18 October 2014 |publisher=University of Portsmouth and others}}</ref> 

The success of the port meant it soon became overwhelmed by the volume of imports and exports, and in 1839 work started on Middlesbrough Dock. Laid out by [[William Cubitt|Sir William Cubitt]], the whole infrastructure was built by resident [[civil engineer]] [[George Turnbull (civil engineer)|George Turnbull]].<ref name=GazDock/> After three years and an expenditure of £122,000 (equivalent to £9.65&nbsp;million at 2011 prices),<ref name=GazDock/> first water was let in on 19 March 1842, and the formal opening took place on 12 May 1842. On completion, the docks were bought by the S&DR.<ref name="GazDock">{{cite news |last=Delplanque |first=Paul |date=17 November 2011 |title=Middlesbrough Dock 1839–1980 |work=[[Teesside Gazette|Evening Gazette]] |publisher=Trinity Mirror |url=http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2011/11/middlesbrough-dock-1839-1980.html |access-date=24 March 2013}}</ref>

Iron and steel dominated and expanded settlements around the Tees, starting from 1841 when [[Henry Bolckow]] in partnership with [[John Vaughan (ironmaster)|John Vaughan]], until the 21st century. 

====Late 1850–present: Old Middlesbrough====
[[File:Old Middlesbrough Town Hall 2013.jpg|right|thumb|Old Town Hall]]
In the latter half of the 19th century, Old Middlesbrough was overshadowed by land built around the newly-built town hall, some miles south of the previous. 
[[File:CIAC Building, Middlehaven, Middlesbrough.jpg|thumb|250px|closest building is the CIAC Building]]
After the moving of the centre, Old Middlesbrough centre started to decline. After the building of the A66, Middlehaven was commonly referred to as "over the border" to the current centre. Victorian era buildings where all but lost to demolition. 

The site started to be called Middlehaven in 1986 on investment proposals to build on the land.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/highs-lows-middlehavens-regeneration-dream-16251398|title=Did the 'Middlehaven dream-maker' achieve what he set out to do?|first=Kelley|last=Price|date=16 June 2019|website=TeessideLive|accessdate=29 November 2020}}</ref> Middlehaven has buildings designated "Boho", offering office space to the area’s business and to attract new companies, or "Bohouse", housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.middlesbrough.gov.uk/business/find-premises/boho-zone|title=Boho Zone|date=31 August 2016|website=www.middlesbrough.gov.uk|accessdate=29 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.business-live.co.uk/technology/growing-digital-firm-animmersion-expands-19071000|title=Growing digital firm Animmersion expands into landmark Boho Zone|first=Coreena|last=Ford|date=8 October 2020|website=Business Live|accessdate=29 November 2020}}</ref>

===Former metalworks===
In 1875, Bolckow, Vaughan & Co opened the Cleveland Steelworks in Middlesbrough beginning the transition from Iron production to Steel and by the turn of the century, [[Teesside]] had become one of the major steel centres in the country and possibly the world. In 1900, [[Bolckow Vaughan|Bolckow, Vaughan & Co]] had become the largest producer of steel in Great Britain. In 1914, [[Dorman Long]], another major steel producer from Middlesbrough, became the largest company in Britain, employing a workforce of over 20,000, and by 1929 it was the dominant steel producer on Teesside after taking over Bolckow, Vaughan & Co and acquiring its assets. It was possibly the largest Steel producer in Britain at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/17352632.theory-spennymoor-church-includes-flamboyant-17th-century-spanish-altar/|title=Theory why a Spennymoor church includes a flamboyant 17th Century Spanish altar|website=The Northern Echo|accessdate=29 November 2020}}</ref>

The steel components of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] (1932) were engineered and fabricated by [[Dorman Long]] of Middlesbrough. The company was also responsible for the [[Tyne Bridge|New Tyne Bridge]] in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref name="DLong201407"/>

Several large shipyards also lined the Tees, including the [[Sir Raylton Dixon|Sir Raylton Dixon & Company]], which produced hundreds of steam freighters including the infamous [[SS Mont-Blanc]], the steamship which caused the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion]] in Canada.

====Bridges====
Via a 1907 [[Act of Parliament]], [[Sir William Arrol & Co.]] of Glasgow built the [[Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge|Transporter Bridge]] (1911) which spans the River Tees between Middlesbrough and [[Port Clarence]]. Some of the film ''[[Billy Elliot]]'' was filmed on the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge.<ref name="visitmiddlesbrough.com" /> At {{convert|850|ft|m}} long and {{convert|225|ft|m}} high, is one of the largest of its type in the world and one of only two left in working order in Britain, the other being in [[Newport, Wales]]. The bridge remains in daily use. It is a Grade&nbsp;II* [[listed building]].

Another landmark, the [[Tees Newport Bridge]], a vertical lift bridge, opened further along the river in 1934. Newport bridge still stands and is passable by traffic, but it can no longer lift the centre section.

====Railway station====
{{further|Middlesbrough railway station}}
{{stnlnk|Middlesbrough}}’s current (gothic style) station opened in 1877, between the old and new town halls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwayarchitecture.org.uk/Location/Middlesbrough/Middlesbrough%20Station.htm|title=Railway Architecture of North East England : Middlesbrough Station|publisher=W. Fawcett|year= 2011|accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>
The Office of Rail and Road statistics reported the station as the fourth busiest in the North East region in the 2018–19 period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orr.gov.uk/statistics/published-stats/station-usage-estimates |title=Estimates of station usage |publisher=Office of Rail and Road Website |accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref>

====Riverside Stadium====
{{further|Riverside Stadium}}
Middlehaven is the current home to the 42,000 capacity [[Riverside Stadium]], opened in 1995. The stadium is owned and host to home-games by [[Middlesbrough Football Club]], currently playing in the [[EFL Championship]], at a lower capacity of 34,742.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-championship/clubs/middlesbrough/|title=Middlesbrough|work=efl.com|access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/riverside-stadiums-new-capacity-confirmed-13298568|title=Riverside Stadium's new capacity confirmed after Boro's relegation to Championship|last=Brown|first=Mike|date=8 July 2017|access-date=14 July 2017}}</ref>

Thirty years after the opening of the stadium, to the south in 2015, places to eat out near the stadium opened. Adjacent shops, originally also planned to open in 2015 but as a supermarket, followed in 2020.<ref name="auto1"/>

====Temenos Sculpture====
{{further|Tees Valley Giants}}
The [[Tees Valley Giants| Temenos]] sculpture, designed by sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] and designer [[Cecil Balmond]], is a steel structure near to the north west side of the stadium. The sculpture stands approximately 110 m long and 50 m high and is held together by steel wire. It was unveiled in 2010 at a cost of £2.7&nbsp;million.
