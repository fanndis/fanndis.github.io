'''''Battle Studies''''' is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter [[John Mayer]], released on November 17, 2009 by [[Columbia Records]]. Production took place from February to August 2009 at Battle Studies recording studio in [[Calabasas, California]], [[Capitol Studios]] in Hollywood, and [[The Village (studio)|The Village]] in [[West Los Angeles, California]], and was handled by Mayer and [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]].

The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 286,000 copies in its first week of sales. It achieved successful sales in several other countries and produced two singles that attained chart success. ''Battle Studies'' received positive reviews from critics, and was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], having sold over 880,000 copies in the United States.

==Background==
After the overwhelming success of ''Continuum'', Mayer confessed to being intimidated about starting on a new album, however he did not want too much time to pass without making new music. Speaking on his motivation to move on, he said "I think it got a lot easier when I realised that no matter what I do, it's not going to be ''Continuum'', good or bad. And then that became really liberating."<ref name=micktaylor>Taylor, Mick (May 21, 2010), [http://www.musicradar.com/us/guitarist/john-mayer-interview-251957 "John Mayer interview"]. ''Music Radar''. March 29, 2015.</ref> On October 1, 2009, Mayer posted via Twitter: "Track listing on ''Battle Studies'' is complete! Very interesting order... 11 songs. 45 minutes. Hit 'em hard and get out."<ref>[https://www.twitter.com/johncmayer/status/4540383246 ]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

The album was leaked just hours before Mayer was scheduled to perform an official "radio leak" on 103.7 Sophie in San Diego.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tryjm.com/2009/11/battle-studies-to-stream-live-on-radio-sophie/ |title=Try JM – A collection of news and notes about John Mayer " Maintenance Mode |website=Tryjm.com |accessdate=2012-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321185322/http://tryjm.com/2009/11/battle-studies-to-stream-live-on-radio-sophie/ |archive-date=March 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> However, Mayer gave his listeners permission to download the leak, as long as they "registered" their copies by ordering the album.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091115023740/http://twitter.com/johncmayer/status/5572615215 ]</ref>
