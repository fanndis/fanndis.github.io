'''''The New Yo<!-- Thinking of a change to "Fart" from your cell phone?

The list is based on a proprietary method that uses sales figures, other data and internal guidelines that are unpublished—how the ''Times'' compiles the list is a trade secret.<ref name=diamond/> In 1983 (as part of a legal argument) the ''Times'' stated that the list is not mathematically objective but rather editorial content.

}}

Although the first best seller list in America was published in 1895, in ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'', a best seller list was not published in ''The New York Times'' until October 12, 1931, 36 years later, with little fanfare.<ref>''The New York Times'', October 12, 1931. 19</ref><ref name=miller>{{cite book |editor=Ezra Greenspan|title=[[Book History (journal)|Book History]] |volume=Volume Three |chapter=The Best-Seller List as Marketing Tool and Historical Fiction |author=Laura J.

A national list was created on April 9, 1942, in the Sunday ''New York Times Book Review'' as a supplement to the Monday edition regular city lists.<ref name=miller/> The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists.<ref name=miller/> Eventually the city lists were eliminated entirely, leaving only the national ranking list, which was compiled according to "reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities".<ref name=miller/> Ranking by bookseller sales figures continues today, although the process has remained proprietary.<ref name=diamond/>

By the 1950s, ''The Times'''s list had become the leading best-seller list for book professionals to monitor, along with that of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.<ref name=miller/> In the 1960s and 1970s, shopping-mall chain bookstores [[B. Dalton]], [[Crown Books]], and [[Waldenbooks]] came to the forefront with a business model of selling newly published best-sellers with mass-market appeal. They used the best-selling status of titles to market the books and not just as a measure of sales, thus placing increased emphasis on the ''New York Times'' list for book readers and book sellers.<ref name=miller/>

As shown in the graph below, the number of titles achieving the number one spot has grown consistently over the years, ranging from fewer than 10 in the 1970s to the high thirties in the past decade. This graph represents fiction titles only. Years with smaller numbers means one or more titles dominated as major best sellers, notably ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' in [[The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2003|2003]] and [[The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2004|2004]], ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' in [[The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2012|2012]] and ''[[Where the Crawdads Sing]]'' in [[The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2019|2019]].<ref>Hawes Publications, [http://www.hawes.com/number1s.htm New York Times Adult Hardcover Best Seller Number Ones Listing Fiction By Date]</ref>

==Composition==
The list is compiled by the editors of the "News Surveys" department, not by ''The New York Times Book Review'' department, where it is published.<ref name=pierleoni/> It is based on weekly sales reports obtained from selected samples of independent and chain bookstores and wholesalers throughout the United States.<ref name=pierleoni/> The sales figures are widely believed to represent books that have actually been sold at retail, rather than wholesale,<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E0D61438F93AA1575BC0A965948260 "Blatty Sue Times on Best-Seller List"], from ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 29, 1983.</ref> as the ''Times'' surveys booksellers in an attempt to better reflect what is purchased by individual buyers. Some books are flagged with a [[Dagger (typography)|dagger]] indicating that a significant number of bulk orders had been received by retail bookstores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction/list.html|work=The New York Times|title=About the Best Sellers}}</ref>

''The New York Times'' reported in 2013 that "we [generally do not] track the sales of classic literature," and thus, for example, new translations of [[Dante's Inferno|Dante's ''Inferno'']] would not be found on the bestseller list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/books/review/inside-the-list.html |title=Inside the List |work=The New York Times Book Review |author=Cowles, Gregory |date=June 2, 2013 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref>

The exact method for compiling the data obtained from the booksellers is classified as a [[trade secret]].<ref name=diamond/> Book Review staff editor Gregory Cowles explained the method "is a secret both to protect our product and to make sure people can't try to rig the system. Even in the Book Review itself, we don't know (the news surveys department's) precise methods."<ref name=pierleoni>{{cite news|author= Pierleoni, Allen|url= http://www.sacbee.com/2012/01/22/4203094/best-sellers-lists-how-they-work.html|title= Best-sellers lists: How they work and who they (mostly) work for|work= The Sacramento Bee|date= January 22, 2012|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120125082356/http://www.sacbee.com/2012/01/22/4203094/best-sellers-lists-how-they-work.html|archivedate= January 25, 2012}}</ref> In 1992, the survey encompassed over 3,000 bookstores as well as "representative wholesalers with more than 28,000 other retail outlets, including variety stores and supermarkets."<ref name=diamond>{{cite book| author=Diamond, Edwin |date=1995| title=Behind the Times: Inside the New New York Times| publisher=University of Chicago Press | url= https://archive.org/details/behindtimesinsid00diam | url-access=registration |page =[https://archive.org/details/behindtimesinsid00diam/page/364 364]}}</ref> By 2004, the number was 4,000 bookstores as well as an unstated number of wholesalers.<ref name=miller/> Data is adjusted to give more weight to independent book stores, which are underrepresented in the sample.<ref name=miller/>

The lists are divided among [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]], print and e-book, paperback and hardcover; each list contains 15 to 20 titles. The lists have been subdivided several times. "Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous" debuted as a list of five on January 1, 1984. It was created because advice best-sellers were sometimes crowding the general non-fiction list.<ref>{{cite news|title=TBR: Inside the list|work=The New York Times|date= February 24, 2008| page= BR26}}</ref> Its inaugural number one bestseller, ''The Body Principal'' by [[Victoria Principal]], had been number 10 and number 12 on the non-fiction lists for the two preceding weeks.<ref>{{cite news|title=The New York Times Book Review Best Sellers| work=The New York Times|date= January 1, 1984| page =BR28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Best Sellers|work=The New York Times|date= December 25, 1983| page =BR13}}</ref> In July 2000, the "Children's Best Sellers" was created after the [[Harry Potter]] series had stayed in the top spots on the fiction list for an extended period of time.<ref>{{cite web|website=riverdeep.net|url=http://www.riverdeep.net/current/2001/11/111201t_top10.jhtml |title=Bestseller Math|date= November 12, 2001}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|website=newyorktimes.com|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/books/the-times-plans-a-children-s-best-seller-list.html|title=The Times Plans a Children's Best-Seller List|date= November 12, 2001}}</ref> The children's list was printed monthly until February 13, 2011, when it was changed to once an issue (weekly). In September 2007, the paperback fiction list was divided into [[Paperback#trp|"trade"]] and [[Paperback#mmp|"mass-market"]] sections, in order to give more visibility to the trade paperbacks that were more often reviewed by the newspaper itself.<ref>{{cite magazine

}}</ref> In November 2010, ''The New York Times'' announced it would be tracking [[e-book]] best-seller lists in fiction and nonfiction starting in early 2011.<ref name=ebook>{{cite news|author=Bosman, Julie |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/books/11list.html |title=''Times'' Will Rank E-Book Best Sellers| work=The New York Times|date= November 10, 2010}}</ref> "RoyaltyShare, a San Diego-based company that tracks data and aggregates sales information for publishers, will ... provide [e-book] data".<ref name=ebook/> The two new e-book lists were first published with the February 13, 2011, issue, the first tracks combined print and e-book sales, the second tracks e-book sales only (both lists are further sub-divided into Fiction and Non-fiction). In addition a third new list was published on the web only, which tracks combined print sales (hardcover and paperback) in fiction and nonfiction. In December 16, 2012, the children's chapter books list was divided into two new lists: middle-grade (ages 8–12) and young adult (age 12–18), both which include sales across all platforms (hard, paper and e-book).

==Criticisms==
The list has been criticized by authors, publishers, book industry executives, and others for not providing an accurate accounting of true best-seller status.<ref name=miller/> These criticisms have been ongoing ever since the list originated.<ref name=miller/> A book industry report in the 1940s found that best-seller lists were a poor indicator of sales, since they were based on misleading data and were only measuring fast sales (see "fast sale" criticism below).<ref name=miller/> A 2004 report quoted a senior book marketing executive who said the rankings were "smoke and mirrors"; while a report in ''[[Book History (journal)|Book History]]'' found that many professionals in the book industry "scoffed at the notion that the lists are accurate".<ref name=miller/>

Specific criticisms include:

*Fast sales.<ref name=miller/><ref>J. E. Fishman, [http://www.thenervousbreakdown.com/jefishman/2010/12/12-common-misperceptions-about-book-publishing/ 12 Common Misperceptions About Book Publishing], ''[[The Nervous Breakdown (magazine)|The Nervous Breakdown]]'', December 1, 2010. Retrieved July 27, 2011.</ref> A book that never makes the list can actually outsell books on the best-seller list. This is because the best-seller list reflects sales in a given week, not total sales. Thus, one book may sell heavily in a given week, making the list, while another may sell at a slower pace, never making the list, but selling more copies over time.
*Double counting. By including wholesalers in the polls along with retail bookstores, books may be double-counted.<ref name=miller/> Wholesalers report how much they sell to retailers, and retailers report how much they sell to customers, thus there can be overlap with the same reported book being sold twice within a given time frame. In addition, retailers may return books to wholesalers months later if they never sell, thus resulting in a "sale" being reported that never came to fruition. For example, mass-market paperbacks can see as high as 40% return rates from the retailer back to the wholesaler.<ref name=miller/> 
*Manipulation by authors and publishers.<ref name=miller/> Author [[Jacqueline Susann]] (''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'') attempted to "butter-up" ''Times''-reporting booksellers and personally bought large quantities of her own book.<ref name=miller/> Author [[Wayne Dyer]] (''[[Your Erroneous Zones]]'') purchased thousands of copies of his own book.<ref name=miller/> [[Al Neuharth]] (''Confessions of an S. O. B.''), former head of [[Gannett Company]], had his Gannett Foundation buy two thousand copies of his own autobiography.<ref name=miller/> In 1995, authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema spent $200,000 to buy ten thousand copies of ''[[The Discipline of Market Leaders]]'' from dozens of bookstores.<ref name=miller/> Although they denied any wrongdoing, the book spent 15 weeks on the list. As a result of this scandal the ''Times'' began placing a dagger symbol next to any title for which bookstores reported bulk orders.<ref name=miller/> However daggers do not always appear; for example [[Tony Hsieh]]'s ''[[Delivering Happiness]]'' was known to have been manipulated with bulk orders but didn't have a dagger.<ref name=bercovici>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/02/22/heres-how-you-buy-your-way-onto-the-new-york-times-bestsellers-list/ |title=Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto The New York Times Bestsellers List |work=Forbes |author=Jeff Bercovici |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 17, 2014}}</ref> Companies that contract with authors to manipulate the bestseller list through "bestseller campaigns" include [[ResultSource]].<ref name=trachtenberg>{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323864304578316143623600544 |title=The Mystery of the Book Sales Spike |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |author=Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 17, 2014}}</ref>
*Manipulation by retailers and wholesalers.<ref name=miller/> It happens with regularity that wholesalers and retailers deliberately or inadvertently manipulate the sales data they report to the ''Times''.<ref name=miller/> Since being on the ''Times'' best-seller list increases the sales of a book, bookstores and wholesalers may report a book is a best-seller before it actually is one, in order that it might later become a "legitimate" best-seller through increased sales due to its inclusion on the best-seller list,<ref name=miller/> leading to the best-seller list becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for the booksellers.
*Leading data collection. The ''Times'' provides booksellers with a form containing a list of books it believes might be bestsellers, to check off, with an alternative "Other" column to fill in manually.<ref name=miller/> It's been criticized as a leading technique to create a best-seller list based on books the ''Times'' thinks might be included.<ref name=miller/> One bookseller compared it to a voting card in which two options for President are provided: "Bill Clinton and Other".<ref name=miller/><!--See pg. 297, a quote from bookseller-->
*Self-fulfilling. Once a book makes it onto the list it is heavily marketed as a "best-seller", purchased by readers who seek out best-sellers, given preferential treatment by retailers, online and offline, who create special best-seller categories including special in-store placement and price discounts, and is carried by retailers that generally don't carry other books (e.g., supermarkets).<ref name=miller/> Thus, the list can become self-fulfilling in determining which books have high sales and remain on the list.<ref name=miller/>
*Conflicts of interest. Due to high financial impact of making the list, since the 1970s publishers have created escalator clauses for major authors stipulating that if a book makes the list the author will receive extra money, based on where it ranks and for how long.<ref name=miller/> Authors may also be able to charge higher speaking fees for the status of being a best-seller.<ref name=miller/> As ''[[Book History]]'' said, "With so much at stake then, it is no wonder that enormous marketing effort goes into getting a book access to this major marketing tool."<ref name=miller/>

==Controversies==
In 1983, author [[William Peter Blatty]] sued ''The New York Times'' for $6 million, claiming that his book, ''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'' (filmed as ''[[The Exorcist III]]''), had not been included in the list due to either negligence or intentional falsehood, saying it should have been included due to high sales. The ''Times'' countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was editorial content and thus protected under the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] as free speech. Blatty appealed it to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. Thus, the lower court ruling stood that the list is editorial content, not objective factual content, so the ''Times'' had the right to exclude books from the list.<ref name=miller/>

In 1995, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema, the authors of a book called ''[[The Discipline of Market Leaders]]'', colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts. The authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to [[Nielsen BookScan|BookScan]]. Because of the benefits of making ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list (speaking engagements, more book deals, and consulting) the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself. The book climbed to No. 4 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks; it also peaked at No. 1 on the ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' best seller list. Since such lists hold the power of [[information cascade|cumulative advantage]], chart success often begets more chart success. Although such efforts are not illegal, publishers consider them unethical.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1995-08-06/did-dirty-tricks-create-a-best-seller |url-access = subscription |publisher  = Bloomberg |title = Did Dirty Tricks Create a Best-Seller? |author = Stern, Willy |date = August 1995 |accessdate = March 18, 2019}}</ref>

In 1999, [[Amazon.com]] announced a 50% decrease in price for books on the Best Seller List to beat its competition, [[Barnes & Noble]].<ref>[http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/1999/06/23/times_bestsellers/index.html Who owns the New York Times bestseller list? ], by Scott Rosenberg, Salon.com, June 23, 1999</ref> After a legal dispute between Amazon and ''The New York Times'', Amazon was permitted to keep using the list on condition that it displayed it in alphabetical rather than numerical order.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211808/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55388629.html Amazon.com and The New York Times Settle Legal Dispute Over Use of Times Best Sellers List], ''Business Wire'', August 9, 1999.</ref> By 2010, this was no longer the case; Amazon now displays the best-seller list in order of best-selling titles first.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/239332 New York Times Bestseller list] at [[Amazon.com]].</ref>

In 2013, ''[[Forbes]]'' published a story titled "Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto ''The New York Times'' Bestsellers List." <ref name=Bercovici2013>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/02/22/heres-how-you-buy-your-way-onto-the-new-york-times-bestsellers-list/|title=Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto The New York Times Bestsellers List |work=[[Forbes]] |author=Jeff Bercovici |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref> The article discusses how [[ResultSource]], a San Diego-based marketing consultancy, specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list, even guaranteeing a No. 1 spot for those willing to pay enough. ''The New York Times'' was informed of this practice and responded: "''The New York Times'' comprehensively tracks and tabulates the weekly unit sales of all titles reported by book retailers as their general interest bestsellers. We will not comment beyond our methodology on the other questions." ''The New York Times'' did not alert its readers to this, unlike ''The Wall Street Journal,'' which admitted that books had landed on its bestseller list due to ResultSource's campaign.<ref name=Trachtenberg2013>{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323864304578316143623600544 |title=The Mystery of the Book Sales Spike |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |author=Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref> Soren Kaplan, the source who admitted he had paid ResultSource to land his book, ''Leapfrogging'', on ''The Wall Street Journal''{{'}}s bestseller list, revealed the methodology on his blog; he posted: "If I could obtain bulk orders before Leapfrogging was released, ResultSource would purchase the books on my behalf using their tried-and-true formula. Three thousand books sold would get me on ''The Wall Street Journal'' bestseller list. Eleven thousand would secure a spot on the biggest prize of them all, ''The New York Times'' list." <ref name=Kaplan2013>{{cite web |url=http://www.leapfrogging.com/2013/02/18/debunking-the-bestseller-book-sales-spike/|title=Debunking the Bestseller |work=[[Blog]] |author=Soren Kaplan |date=February 2013 |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref>

In 2014, the ''Los Angeles Times'' published a story titled "Can bestseller lists be bought?"<ref name=kellogg2014>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-pastor-contract-resultsource-bestseller-lists-20140305,0,7039368.story#axzz2vCwCm0fo |title=Can bestseller lists be bought? |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author=Carolyn Kellogg |date=March 6, 2014 |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}</ref> It describes how author and pastor [[Mark Driscoll (pastor)|Mark Driscoll]] contracted the company [[ResultSource]] to place his book ''[[Real Marriage]]'' (2012) on ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list for a $200,000 fee. The contract was for ResultSource "to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book, ''Real Marriage'' on the week of January 2, 2012. The bestseller campaign is intended to place ''Real Marriage'' on ''The New York Times'' bestseller list for the Advice How-to list." To achieve this, the contract stated that "RSI will be purchasing at least 11,000 total orders in one week." This took place, and the book successfully reached No.1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22, 2014.<ref name=kellogg2014/>

In July 2015, [[Ted Cruz]]'s book ''A Time For Truth'' was excluded from the list because the "overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales [of Cruz's book] were limited to strategic bulk purchases" to artificially increase sales and entry onto the list. In response, Cruz called the ''Times'' "a liar" and demanded an apology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/07/cruz-campaign-new-york-times-is-lying-about-bulk-book-sales-210318 |title=Cruz campaign: New York Times is lying about bulk book sales |work=Politico |author=Dylan Byers |date=July 10, 2015 |accessdate=September 3, 2015}}</ref> The ''Times'' said it stood by its statement and evidence of manipulation.

In August 2017, a young adult fiction book, ''Handbook for Mortals'' by previously unpublished author Lani Sarem was removed from the list, where it was in initially in the #1 spot. According to a statement issued by the ''Times'', "after investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we decided that the sales for ''Handbook for Mortals'' did not meet our criteria for inclusion. We've issued an updated 'Young Adult Hardcover' list for September 3, 2017 which does not include that title."<ref name=Italie/> It was uncovered, by author Phil Stamper, that there had been unusual bulk ordering patterns which inflated the number of sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-ya-20170824-story.html |title=Did a YA book buy its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list? |work=LA Times |author=Jessica Roy |date=August 24, 2017 |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref> The book is published by GeekNation, an entertainment website based in Los Angeles.<ref name=Italie>{{cite news|last1=Italie|first1=Hillel|title=Book Pulled From Best-Seller List|url=http://time.com/4917209/ny-times-best-seller-handbook-for-mortals/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Time|agency=Associated Press|date=August 26, 2017}}</ref> The book was originally written as a script, and was rewritten as a novel in an attempt to launch a film franchise.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ha|first1=Thu-Huong|title=A first-time author unwittingly exposed the house of cards beneath 'bestseller' books|url=https://qz.com/1062280/a-first-time-author-unwittingly-exposed-the-house-of-cards-beneath-bestseller-books/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Quartz|date=August 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/geeknation-launches-book-publishing-arm-partners-lani-sarem-ya-series-handbook-mortals-1024909 |title=GeekNation Launches Book Publishing Arm, Partners with Lani Sarem on YA Series 'Handbook for Mortals' |work=The Hollywood Reporter |author=Chris Gardner |date=July 28, 2017 |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>

In August 2017, conservative publisher [[Regnery Publishing]] said it would no longer allow its writers to claim "''New York Times'' best-selling authors" due to its belief the ''Times'' favors liberal books on the list. The ''Times'' responded the political views of authors have no bearing on the list and noted conservative authors routinely rank highly on the list. The [[Associated Press]] noted the ''Times'' is a frequent target of conservatives and Republicans.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/09/04/us/ap-us-books-publisher-times-the-latest.html |title=The Latest: New York Times Denies List Favors Liberal Books |work=Associated Press |date=September 4, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912124509/https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/09/04/us/ap-us-books-publisher-times-the-latest.html |archivedate=September 12, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called Regenery's ban a "stunt" designed to increase sales, "What better way to sell a book to a conservative audience than to promote the idea that the New York Times doesn't like it?" The ''Post'' compared the list to best seller lists from ''Publishers Weekly'' looking for bias but could not find anything convincing.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/06/why-a-conservative-book-publishers-protest-of-the-new-york-times-bestsellers-list-is-just-a-stunt/ |title=Why a conservative book publisher’s protest of the New York Times bestsellers list is just a stunt |work=Washington Post |author=Callum Borchers and Kevin Uhrmacher |date=September 6, 2017 |accessdate=September 12, 2017}}</ref>

In February 2018, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' published a story by books editor Deborah Dundas who found that the best-selling book ''[[12 Rules for Life]]'' by [[Jordan Peterson]], who topped ''Publishers Weekly'' chart list, did not even chart on ''The New York Times'' bestsellers list, without reliable answers from NYT. The NYT stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company.<ref>{{cite news|first=Deborah|last=Dundas|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/books/2018/02/09/jordan-petersons-book-is-a-bestseller-except-where-it-matters-most.html|title=Jordan Peterson's book is a bestseller – except where it matters most|date=February 9, 2018|work=[[Toronto Star]]|access-date=March 3, 2018}}</ref> According to [[Random House of Canada|Random House Canada]], the book was handled properly for the U.S. market.<ref name="Hopper">{{cite news|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/could-jordan-peterson-become-the-best-selling-canadian-author-of-all-time/wcm/46d59986-21ef-4b18-a7c6-b0edfd4b75ae|title=Could Jordan Peterson become the best-selling Canadian author of all time?|first=Tristin|last=Hopper|date=March 7, 2018|work=Edmonton Journal|access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Brian|last=Stelter|author-link=Brian Stelter|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/16/media/trump-new-york-times-best-selling-books/index.html|title=Every top New York Times best-seller this year has been about Trump|date=April 16, 2018|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=April 17, 2018}}</ref> American conservative commentator [[Dennis Prager]] wrote an article for ''[[National Review]]'' titled "''The Times'' Best-Seller List: Another Reason Americans Don't Trust the Media" in which he contends that the issue with Peterson's book, as well his ''The Rational Bible: Exodus'', is their conservative context and the lack of inclusion is the American mainstream media's manipulation.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dennis|last=Prager|author-link=Dennis Prager|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/04/new-york-times-bestseller-list-biased-book-news/|title=The Times Best-Seller List: Another Reason Americans Don't Trust the Media|date=April 17, 2018|work=[[National Review]]|access-date=April 17, 2018}}</ref> NYT denied any bias.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/new-york-times-denies-bias-against-conservative-authors-during-intense-shareholder-meeting-advocate-says|title=New York Times denies bias against conservative authors during intense shareholder meeting, advocate says|author=Brian Flood|date=April 19, 2018|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=October 22, 2018}}</ref>

==Studies==
A [[Stanford Business School]] analysis suggests that the "majority of book buyers seem to use the ''Times''{{'}} list as a signal of what's worth reading".<ref name="stanford">{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0502/research_sorensen_consumers.shtml|title=Readers Tap Best-Seller List for New Authors|publisher=Stanford Business Magazine|date=February 2005|accessdate=December 23, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920180813/https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0502/research_sorensen_consumers.shtml|archivedate=September 20, 2006}} See also Alan T. Sorensen, ''Bestseller Lists and Product Variety: The Case of Book Sales'', May 2004.</ref> The study concluded that lesser-known writers get the biggest benefit from being on the list, while perennial best-selling authors, such as [[John Grisham]] or [[Danielle Steel]], see no benefit of additional sales.<ref name="stanford"/>
