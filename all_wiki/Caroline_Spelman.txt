==Education==
Born in [[Bishop's Stortford]], Hertfordshire, Spelman attended the Hertfordshire and Essex High School for Girls (now called [[The Hertfordshire and Essex High School]]), in Bishop's Stortford, and received a [[Bachelor's degree#Honours Degrees and academic distinctions|BA First Class]] in European Studies from [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College, University of London]].

==Early career==
She was [[Sugar Beet]] commodity secretary for the [[National Farmers Union (England and Wales)|National Farmers' Union]] from 1981 to 1984. She was deputy director of the International Confederation of European Beet Growers (officially known as ''La Confédération Internationale des Betteraviers Européens'' – CIBE) in Paris from 1984–9, then a research fellow for the Centre for European Agricultural Studies (part of the [[University of Kent]] and since 2000 known as the Centre for European Agri-Environmental Economics) from 1989 to 1993. She co-owns Spelman, Cormack & Associates, a lobbying firm for the food and biotechnology industry, with her husband.<ref name="newrulingclass">{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/10/oxford-universitywealth-school|title=The new ruling class|work=[[NewStatesman]]|accessdate=11 October 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004124121/http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/10/oxford-universitywealth-school|archivedate=4 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Parliamentary career==
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2016}}
Before entering Parliament in 1997, she stood unsuccessfully in the [[Bassetlaw (UK Parliament constituency)|Bassetlaw]] constituency in Nottinghamshire at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Election Results: Overnight declarations nationwide|date=10 April 1992|work=The Guardian|page=7|id = {{ProQuest|187242016}}}}</ref>

In 2001, [[Iain Duncan Smith]] appointed Spelman Shadow Secretary of State for International Development, a post she maintained until Duncan Smith's departure as Conservative Party leader. Duncan Smith's successor, [[Michael Howard]], opted for a streamlined Shadow Cabinet and omitted Spelman; however, he later appointed her as a [[front bench]] spokeswoman on Environmental Affairs working for [[Theresa May]]. In March 2004, Spelman re-entered the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Local and Devolved Government Affairs, succeeding [[David Curry]]. Under [[David Cameron]]'s leadership of the Conservative Party, in 2007 she was promoted further to become [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|Conservative Party Chairman]].

In 2009, Spelman was moved in another reshuffle to the role of Shadow [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]], replacing [[Eric Pickles]]. In 2012, Spelman returned to the Commons backbenches. Spelman was opposed to Brexit prior to the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]].<ref name="thespectatorwhichtorympsbackbrexit">{{cite news|last1=Goodenough|first1=Tom|title=Which Tory MPs back Brexit, who doesn't and who is still on the fence?|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/which-tory-mps-back-brexit-who-doesnt-and-who-is-still-on-the-fence/|accessdate=11 October 2016|work=The Spectator|date=16 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022111657/http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/which-tory-mps-back-brexit-who-doesnt-and-who-is-still-on-the-fence/|archivedate=22 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In January 2016, Spelman became a Founding MP of [https://web.archive.org/web/20160202003627/https://www.reformineurope.org/ Conservatives For Reform In Europe], the campaign to remain in the EU, subject to the Prime Minister's renegotiations, alongside [[Nick Herbert]] and Eric Pickles.

In January 2019 MPs approved a symbolic, non-binding amendment, tabled by Spelman, to prevent a no-deal [[Brexit]], by 318 votes to 310.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/video-news/mps-approve-dame-caroline-spelmans-amendment-to-prevent-nodeal-brexit-37763095.html|title=MPs approve Dame Caroline Spelman's amendment to prevent no-deal Brexit|website=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|accessdate=29 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/29/brexit-vote-commons-latest-news-developments-liam-fox-says-may-now-saying-withdrawal-deal-text-must-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-5c50b67be4b084eaaff7fbc5|title=Brexit: MPs vote for Brady amendment to renegotiate Irish backstop – Politics live|first1=Andrew|last1=Sparrow|first2=Larry|last2=Elliott|date=29 January 2019|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

Following abuse and death threats over Brexit, Spelman announced in September 2019 that she would not seek re-election at the next general election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-49593559|title=Dame Caroline Spelman standing down over 'Brexit abuse'|work=BBC News|date=5 September 2019|accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref>

==Expenses==
In 2009, during the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|expenses scandal]] it was reported that Spelman had received £40,000 for cleaning and bills for her constituency home; this was despite her husband claiming it was their main home. In 2008 she reportedly over-claimed hundreds of pounds towards her council tax.<ref name="newrulingclass" />

==="Nannygate" controversy===
On 6 June 2008, Spelman was the subject of controversy when it was suggested that for around twelve months from May 1997 she paid her child's nanny, Tina Haynes, from her parliamentary staffing allowance, contrary to the rule governing such allowances and fears of the misuse of them. Spelman claims that her nanny also acted as her constituency secretary and was paid from the public taxpayers' purse for this aspect of her further employment. Haynes confirms that occasionally she would answer phone calls and post documents but initially she denied such happenings when interviewed on BBC Two's ''[[Newsnight]]'' via telephone. The accusations came at a time when Conservative Party leader David Cameron had tasked Spelman with reviewing the use of parliamentary allowances by Conservative [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]s and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s in the wake of the [[Derek Conway]] affair.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7441360.stm Tory MP paid nanny from expenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518024104/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7441360.stm |date=18 May 2009 }}, BBC</ref>

The allegation against Spelman came shortly after two Conservative MEPs, [[Giles Chichester]] (Leader of the Conservatives in the EU Parliament) and [[Den Dover]] (Conservative Chief Whip in the EU Parliament), were forced to resign amid claims they misused their parliamentary allowances. However, Spelman was not urged to resign by party leader, David Cameron. She referred the matter pertaining to herself, her nanny and parliamentary funds to [[John Lyon (commissioner)|John Lyon]], the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/2089266/Tory-chairman-Caroline-Spelman-to-meet-standards-commissioner-over-nanny-expenses.html Tory chairman Caroline Spelman to meet standards commissioner over nanny expenses], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' 7 June 2008</ref> Senior Conservative colleagues including former [[Shadow Home Secretary]] [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] stated their support for Spelman.<ref>[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/pressass/20080608/tuk-tories-rally-round-spelman-6323e80.html Tories rally round Spelman [[Yahoo!

New allegations were reported on the BBC's ''Newsnight'' programme that nine years previously Spelman's secretary, Sally Hammond, complained to the Conservative Party leadership that she was using Parliamentary allowances to pay her nanny and that the arrangement with the nanny was over a two-year period and not one.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7476527.stm | work=BBC News | title=MPs call for Spelman to be sacked | date=26 June 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518043514/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7476527.stm | archivedate=18 May 2009 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In March 2009, the Commons [[Standards and Privileges Committee]] ruled that Caroline Spelman had misused her allowances to pay for nannying work in 1997 and 1998.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

==Privacy injunction==
On 24 February 2012, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London refused to continue a privacy injunction previously granted to prevent the publication of a news item in the ''[[Daily Star Sunday]]'' involving her son. Judge [[Michael Tugendhat]] said that the injunction was "not necessary or proportionate".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17155918 |title=Caroline Spelman's son loses privacy injunction bid |work=[[BBC News]] |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=24 February 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301004022/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17155918 |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 2 March 2012, the Spelmans decided not to appeal against the decision, which permitted the publication of a story about her son.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17233866 |title=Caroline Spelman's son 'took drugs after sports injury' |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2 March 2012 |accessdate=2 March 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302180518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17233866 |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Spelman family was required to pay the legal costs of the ''Daily Star Sunday'', in addition to their own legal costs of £60,994.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/home/politics/article/16181231 |title=Cabinet Minister's Son Sorry Over Drug Use |publisher=Sky News |date=2 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304201240/http://news.sky.com/home/politics/article/16181231 |archivedate=4 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/237453/Court-win-for-The-Daily-Star-Sunday/Court-win-for-The-Daily-Star-SundayCourt-win-for-The-Daily-Star-Sunday|title=Court Win for the Daily Star Sunday|first=Tom |last=Savage|date=26 February 2012}} (The ''Daily Star Sunday'' was party to the legal action)</ref>

==Personal life==
She married Mark Spelman, a senior partner at [[Accenture]], on 25 April 1987 in south-east Kent. Her husband stood as a Conservative candidate in the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European elections]] for the [[West Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|West Midlands]] region. They have two sons and a daughter. In 1997, Spelman was the only Conservative MP who was also a mother of school-age children; the Conservative party instructed that her children should be educated in her constituency as a condition of her selection as MP. As a result, Spelman rarely saw her children and she found this period of her life very stressful, losing a significant amount of weight.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women of Westminster : the MPs who changed politics|last=Reeves, Rachel, 1979-|isbn=978-1-78831-677-4|location=London|oclc=1084655208|date = 7 March 2019}}</ref>
