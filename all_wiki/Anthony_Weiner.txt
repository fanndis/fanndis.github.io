He was released from prison in February 2019, and released from [[halfway house]] custody in May 2019.

A New York City native, Weiner attended public schools and graduated from [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh|SUNY Plattsburgh]] in 1985 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[political science]]. He was a member of the [[New York City Council]] from 1992 to 1998 and a [[Congressional staff|congressional aide]] to U.S. Representative [[Chuck Schumer]] from 1985 to 1991. He was an unsuccessful candidate for [[Mayor of New York City]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 2005|2005]] and [[New York City mayoral election, 2013|2013]] New York City mayoral elections.

== Early life ==
Weiner was born in the New York City borough of [[Brooklyn]], the middle son of Jewish parents, Mort Weiner, a lawyer, and his wife, Frances (née Finkelstein), a public high school math teacher.<ref name="stepping" /><ref name="house1" /><ref name="the truth is" /> The family lived for a time in the [[Park Slope]] neighborhood of Brooklyn. Weiner attended elementary school at [[Public School 39|P.S. 39 The Henry Bristow School]]. His older brother Seth was 39 years old when he was killed by a [[Hit and run|hit-and-run driver]] in 2000.<ref name="seth"/><ref name="NyMag2001"/> His younger brother, Jason, is a chef and co-owner of several New York restaurants.<ref name="nutshell"/>

Weiner took the [[Specialized High Schools Admissions Test]], an examination used to determine admission to all but one of New York City's [[Specialized high schools in New York City|specialized high schools]], and was admitted to [[Brooklyn Technical High School]], from which he graduated in 1981.<ref name="scrappy" /> He  attended the [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh]],<ref name="newsday profile" /> and spent his junior year as an exchange student at the [[College of William & Mary]], where he was friends with future comic and political commentator [[Jon Stewart]].<ref>

</ref> Weiner's interests turned towards politics; he became active in student government and was named most effective student senator.<ref name="NyMag2001"/>

After he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]] in 1985, Weiner joined the staff of then–[[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] and current [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chuck Schumer|Charles Schumer]]. He worked in Schumer's [[Washington, D.C.]] office for three years, then transferred to the district office in Brooklyn in 1988, when Schumer encouraged him to become involved in local politics.<ref name="rapid rise"/>

== New York City Council ==
After working for Schumer for six years, Weiner got his first chance at political office in 1991 when the [[New York City Council]] was expanded from 35 to 51 seats.<ref name="dirty trick" /> Weiner was considered a long-shot because he faced strong competition in the Democratic primary elections from two other candidates who had better local name recognition and funding.<ref name="house1" /><ref name="dirty trick" /> Weiner narrowly won the primary, besting [[Adele Cohen]] by fewer than 200 votes. Controversy ensued in the last weeks of the campaign after Weiner's campaign anonymously spread leaflets around the district that had alleged ties between Cohen and the so-called "Jackson-Dinkins agenda"; the leaflets referred to the [[Crown Heights riots]] earlier in the year, after which white residents had seen [[Jesse Jackson]], who became notorious for his earlier remarks about New York City as "[[Hymietown]]", and then-mayor [[David Dinkins]] as having been beholden to the predominantly African-American rioters and therefore endangering whites.<ref>Kornacki, Steve. {{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/06/10/anthony_weiner_mailer/index.html |title=The woman Anthony Weiner smeared speaks out |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613042216/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/06/10/anthony_weiner_mailer/index.html |archivedate=June 13, 2011 }}</ref><ref>

Weiner's win in the November general election was widely considered a formality because he had no opposition in the heavily Democratic district.  He was 27 years old when he became the youngest councilman in the city's history.<ref name="house1" /><ref name="dirty trick" /> Over the next seven years on the City Council, Weiner initiated programs to address [[quality of life]] concerns. He also started a program to put at-risk and troubled teens to work cleaning up [[graffiti]], and he backed development plans that helped revive the historic [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Sheepshead Bay]] area.<ref name="house1" /><ref>

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===
In 1998, Weiner ran for [[United States Congress|Congress]] from [[New York's 9th congressional district]], which was the seat held by his mentor, Chuck Schumer, who was running for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. Weiner won the Democratic primary election, which was [[tantamount to election]] in the heavily Democratic district that included parts of [[South Brooklyn|southern Brooklyn]] and south and central [[Queens, New York|Queens]].<ref name="in Queens" /><ref name="political graveyard" />

=== Domestic issues ===
[[File:NLN Anthony Weiner.jpg|thumb|right|Weiner shows his support for the LGBT community during the New York City [[New York City LGBT Pride March|Gay Pride Parade]], 2009.]]
Weiner received a 100% rating from the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] in 2003 and a 0% rating from [[National Right to Life Committee]] 2006, which indicated a strong [[pro-choice]] voting record.<ref name="on issues" /> He was critical of the 2009 [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]] to the [[Affordable Care Act]], which prohibits the use of taxpayer funds for [[abortion]]s, calling it "unnecessary and divisive" and saying it would prevent health insurers from offering abortion coverage regardless of whether an individual uses federal funds to purchase an insurance plan.<ref name="poison pill" />

In April 2008, Weiner created the [[bi-partisan]] Congressional Middle Class Caucus.<ref name="anthony seriously" /> He received an "A" on the [[Drum Major Institute]]'s 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.<ref name="midterm" /> In June 2008, Weiner sponsored a bill to increase the number of [[O visa|O-visas]] available to foreign fashion models, arguing that it would help boost the fashion industry in New York City.<ref name="for models" /> He criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.<ref name="scofflaw diplomats" />

During the health care reform debates of 2009, Weiner advocated for a bill called the [[United States National Health Care Act]], which would have expanded [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] to all Americans, regardless of age.<ref name="W_hardball" /><ref name="SP_speech" /> He remarked that while 4% of Medicare funds go to overhead,<ref name="HA_overhead" /> private insurers put 30% of their customer's money into profits and overhead instead of into health care.<ref name="W_scar" /> In late July 2009, he secured a full House floor vote for [[single payer health care]] in exchange for not amending [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009]] in committee [[Markup (legislation)|mark-up]] with a single-payer plan.<ref name="will vote" />

When a [[public health insurance option]] was being considered as part of America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, Weiner said that it would help reduce costs, and he set up a website to push for the option.<ref name="W_scar" /> He attracted widespread attention when described the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]] as "a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry, teaming up with a small group of Democrats to try to protect that industry".<ref name="olbermann" /> In February 2010, he proclaimed in front of Congress that "every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry."<ref name="ever met" />

Weiner was the chief sponsor of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009,<ref name="PACT" /><ref name="mail ban" /> which made the selling of tobacco in violation of any state tax law a federal [[felony|crime]], and effectively ended Internet tobacco smuggling by stopping shipments of cigarettes through the [[United States Postal Service]]. He claimed, "This new law will give states and localities a major revenue boost by cracking down on the illegal sale of tobacco", and added that "Every day we delay is another day that New York loses significant amounts of tax revenue and kids have easy access to tobacco products sold over the Internet."<ref name="mail ban" />

On July 29, 2010, Weiner criticized Republicans for opposing the [[James Zadroga|9/11 Health and Compensation Act]], which would provide for funds for sick [[Certified first responder|first responders]] to the [[9/11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. In a speech on the floor of the House, he accused Republicans of hiding behind procedural questions as an excuse to vote against the bill.<ref name="weiner erupts" />

In response to pressure from Weiner, [[YouTube]] removed some of [[Anwar al-Awlaki]]'s inflammatory videos from its website in November 2010.<ref name="nytimes3" /> Weiner voted against the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]]. As a prominent Democratic opponent of the tax cut package passed by Congress, Weiner said Republicans had gotten the better of President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] in the negotiations to reach an agreement on the $858 billion deal and said the Republicans turned out to be "better poker players" than Obama.<ref name="poker players" />

In 2002 Weiner voiced strong criticism of removing the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] debris without investigating it for determining the causes of the collapses of Tower 1, 2 and 7.<ref>

</ref>

=== Foreign policy ===
In 2002, Weiner voted to give President [[George W. Bush]] the authority to use military force against [[Iraq]].<ref name="attack ok'd" /> In May 2006, Weiner attempted to bar the Palestinian delegation from entering the United Nations. He added that the delegation "should start packing their little Palestinian terrorist bags", and went on to claim that [[Human Rights Watch]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', and [[Amnesty International]] are all biased against [[Israel]].<ref name="getsitwrong" />

On July 29, 2007, Weiner and Rep. [[Jerrold Nadler]] (D-N.Y.) objected to a $20-billion arms deal that the Bush Administration had negotiated with Saudi Arabia because they didn't want to provide "sophisticated weapons to a country that they believe has not done enough to stop terrorism", noting that 15 of the 19 [[9/11 hijackers|hijackers]] of [[September 11, 2001]], were Saudis. Weiner made the announcement outside of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Washington, stating, "We need to send a crystal clear message to the Saudi Arabian government that their tacit approval of terrorism can't go unpunished." The two intended to use a provision of the [[Arms Export Control Act]] to review the deal and pass a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.<ref name="lawmakers vow" />

Weiner and several other members of Congress later criticized the Obama administration's proposal to sell over $60&nbsp;billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. He said: "Saudi Arabia is not deserving of our aid, and by arming them with advanced American weaponry we are sending the wrong message", and described Saudi Arabia as having a "history of financing terrorism" and teaching "[[hatred of Christians]] and Jews" to its schoolchildren.<ref name="some congressmen" />

=== Criticisms and controversies ===
In July 2008, ''The New York Times'' characterized Weiner as one of the most intense and demanding of bosses. The newspaper described him as a person who often worked long hours with his staff and required them to be in constant contact via [[BlackBerry]]. He frequently yelled at them and occasionally threw office furniture in anger. As a result of Weiner's actions, the ''Times'' reported that he had one of the highest staff turnover rates of any member of Congress; this included the departure of three chiefs of staff within an 18-month period. Weiner admitted he pushed his aides hard but said that his speaking at a high decibel level was part of his background and style, not necessarily shouting. Though some former employees were critical of his supervisory practices, others praised him for his intense involvement in constituent concerns and readiness to fight for New York City.<ref name="nytstaff" />

A 2010 license plate check by the [[Capitol Hill]] newspaper ''[[Roll Call]]'' showed that Weiner's vehicles were among several owned by members of Congress that had unpaid tickets. Weiner's past due fines, which spanned three years and totaled more than $2,000, were among the highest uncovered by ''Roll Call'' and were paid in full shortly after publication of the article.<ref name="members collect" /><ref name="racks up" /> On June 13, 2011, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' reported that one of Weiner's vehicles, though it had been issued valid plates, was displaying expired plates that had been issued to another one of his vehicles.<ref name="unregistered" /> Weiner had previously criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.<ref name="scofflaw diplomats" />

== Sexting scandals, prosecution, and guilty plea ==
{{Main|Anthony Weiner sexting scandals}}
On May 27, 2011, Weiner used his public [[Twitter]] account to send a link to a woman who was following him on [[Twitter]]. The link contained a sexually explicit photograph of himself.<ref name="business insider" /><ref name="cheezburger" /><ref name="bellingham student" /> After several days of denying that he had posted the image,<ref name="emotional" /><ref name="I did not send" /><ref name="right's blogger" /><ref name="new half" /> Weiner held a press conference at which he admitted he had "exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years" and apologized for his earlier denials.<ref name="weiner apologizes" /><ref name="press conf" /><ref name="admits internet" /> After an explicit photo was leaked through the Twitter account of a listener of ''[[The Opie & Anthony Show]]'',<ref name="democrats push" /> Weiner announced on June 16, 2011, that he would resign from Congress,<ref name="resignation" /><ref name="WSJresign" /><ref name="pension" /><ref name="hasn" /> and he formally did so on June 21.<ref name="resign" /> A special election was held on September 13, 2011 to replace him; Republican businessman [[Bob Turner (American politician)|Bob Turner]] defeated Democrat [[David Weprin]] to fill Weiner's seat.<ref>

A second sexting scandal began on July 23, 2013, which was several months after Weiner returned to politics in the New York City mayoral race.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|first=Tom|last=McCarty|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/23/anthony-weiner-new-york-explicit-photographs|title=New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner says explicit photo is of him|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2013|accessdate=3 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129225439/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/23/anthony-weiner-new-york-explicit-photographs|archive-date=November 29, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Weiner sent explicit photos under the alias "Carlos Danger" to a 22-year-old woman with whom he had contact as late as April 2013, which was more than a year after he had left Congress.<ref name="guardian" /> The woman was later identified as Sydney Leathers.

On August 28, 2016, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Weiner had [[sexted]] another woman, including sending a picture while he was lying in bed with his young son.<ref>

</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported the next day that Weiner and his wife [[Huma Abedin]] intended to separate.

=== 2005 ===
Weiner sought the Democratic nomination to run for [[New York City mayoral election, 2005|New York City mayor in 2005]], vying against three other candidates. He had a three-part pitch to voters that included criticizing sitting Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] for his top-down style of management and promising a more democratic approach; against "passivity in City Hall" and for getting more federal money for the city; and a series of ideas on how to get the city to work better.<ref name="stepping" /><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://observer.com/2005/09/ferrer-is-first-weiner-snares-piece-of-ballot/ | title=Ferrer is First, Weiner Snares Piece of Ballot| date=September 19, 2005}}</ref> He presented a book of 50 "Real Solutions" and among his policy proposals were fixes for the health care and educational systems.<ref name="stepping" /> One idea already in play was a neighborhood scrubbing-up program he dubbed "Weiner's Cleaners".<ref name="stepping" />

Weiner started out last in many polls,<ref name="stepping" /> but gained ground in the final weeks of the campaign, coming in second. Initial election returns had [[Fernando Ferrer]] with 39.95% of the vote, just shy of the 40% required to avoid a runoff against Weiner, who had 28.82%, but Weiner conceded, citing the need for party unity and denying rumors that various high-ranking New York Democrats, such as Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] and [[New York Attorney General]] [[Eliot Spitzer]], had urged him to concede. [[Absentee ballots]] put Ferrer over the 40% mark in the official [[New York City mayoral election, 2005#Democratic primary election results|primary election returns]].<ref>

== Post-congressional consulting and lobbying work ==
In July 2011 (which was less than a month after he left Congress), Weiner created the consulting firm Woolf-Weiner Associates. He advised over a dozen companies that included electronic medical records providers and [[biofuel]] firms. He worked with [[Covington & Burling]], an international law firm. According to 2012 public disclosures, his work helped increase his combined family income to $496,000. Weiner argued that despite contacting members of Congress on behalf of his clients, his work did not meet the legal definition of [[lobbying]].<ref>
