===Kaniv four===
Since the summer of 1999 there was a sharp competition among the candidates. Four candidates [[Yevhen Marchuk]], [[Oleksandr Moroz]], [[Volodymyr Oliynyk]] (mayor of [[Cherkasy]]), and [[Oleksandr Tkachenko (politician)|Oleksandr Tkachenko]] (speaker of [[Verkhovna Rada]]) met in [[Kaniv]] and called on all candidates to just and honest elections. The "Kaniv Four" had intentions to present a single candidate who would have more chances for success. It however failed to do so and no one else joined them neither. [[Volodymyr Oliynyk]] being promoted by [[Kropyvnytskyi|Kirovohrad]] city residents, on October 27 surrendered his candidacy in favor of [[Yevhen Marchuk]], while [[Oleksandr Tkachenko (politician)|Oleksandr Tkachenko]] favored [[Petro Symonenko]] (leader of [[Communist Party of Ukraine]]).

==Conduct==
According to historian [[Serhy Yekelchyk]] President Kuchma's administration "employed electoral fraud freely" during the election.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KRBCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA87&dq=Ukrainian+constitutional+referendum+election+fraud+2000&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtwbHUpszaAhXQDuwKHeJqBJsQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Ukrainian%20constitutional%20referendum%20election%20fraud%202000&f=false ''The Conflict in Ukraine: What Everyone Needs to Know''] by [[Serhy Yekelchyk]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2015, {{ISBN|0190237287}} (page 87)</ref>

==Results==
In the first round the most oblasts and the out-of-country district were won by Leonid Kuchma. In seven oblasts the top candidate was Petro Symonenko mostly in the centre and south. Oleksandr Moroz managed to become the leader in the more agrarian oriented [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava]] and [[Vinnytsia Oblast]]s. Nataliya Vitrenko took the peak of the candidate list in the [[Sumy Oblast]].
