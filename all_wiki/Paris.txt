== Etymology ==
{{hatnote|See [[wikt:Paris|Wiktionary]] for the name of Paris in various languages other than English and French.}}
The name 'Paris' is derived from its early inhabitants, the [[Gauls|Gallic]] [[Parisii (France)|Parisii]] tribe.{{Sfn|Delamarre|2003|p=247}} The meaning of the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] name ''Parisii'' is debated.{{Sfn|Delamarre|2003|p=247}}{{Sfn|Busse|2006|p=199}} According to [[Xavier Delamarre]], it may derive from the root ''pario-'' ('cauldron').{{Sfn|Delamarre|2003|p=247}} [[Alfred Holder]] interpreted ''Parisii'' as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing the name to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''peryff'' ('lord, commander'), from ''paraf'' - ''peri'' ('to make, produce, command to be done').{{Sfn|Busse|2006|p=199}} The city's name is not related to the [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Greek mythology]].

Paris is often referred to as the 'City of Light' (''La Ville Lumière''),{{sfn|Robertson|2010|p=37}} both because of its leading role during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and more literally because Paris was one of the first large European cities to use gas [[street light]]ing on a grand scale on its boulevards and monuments. [[Gas lighting|Gas lights]] were installed on the [[Place du Carrousel]], [[Rue de Rivoli]] and [[Place Vendôme|Place Vendome]] in 1829. By 1857, the Grand boulevards were lit.<ref>Fierro, Alfred, ''Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris'' (1996), page 838</ref> By the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps.{{sfn|Du Camp|1875|p=596}} Since the late 19th century, Paris has also been known as ''Panam(e)'' ({{IPA-fr|panam|pron}}) in [[argot|French slang]].{{sfn|Leclanche|1998|p=55}}

Inhabitants are known in English as "Parisians" and in French as ''Parisiens'' ({{IPA-fr|paʁizjɛ̃||Parisien2.ogg}}). They are also pejoratively called ''Parigots'' ({{IPA-fr|paʁiɡo||Parigot.ogg}}).<ref group="note">The word was most likely created by Parisians of the lower popular class who spoke *argot*, then *parigot* was used in a provocative manner outside the Parisian region and throughout France to mean Parisians in general.</ref>{{sfn|Dottin|1920|p=535}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of Paris|Timeline of Paris}}

=== Origins ===
{{main|Lutetia}}
The ''[[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]]'', a sub-tribe of the [[Celt]]ic [[Senones]], inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.{{sfn|Arbois de Jubainville|Dottin|1889|p=132}}{{sfn|Cunliffe|2004|p=201}} One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on the [[île de la Cité]]; this meeting place of land and water trade routes gradually became an important trading centre.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=25}} The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins for that purpose.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=65–70}}
[[File:ParisiiCoins.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Gold coins minted by the Parisii (1st century BC)]]

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered the [[Paris Basin]] in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris' [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=88–104}} The Roman town was originally called [[Lutetia]] (more fully, ''Lutetia Parisiorum'', "Lutetia of the Parisii", modern French ''Lutèce''). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an [[amphitheatre]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=154–67}}

By the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as ''Parisius'', a Latin name that would later become ''Paris'' in French.{{Sfn|Meunier|2014|p=12}} [[Christianity]] was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint [[Saint Denis of Paris|Denis]], the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as ''Mons Martyrum'' (Latin "Hill of Martyrs"), later "[[Montmartre]]", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], and many French kings are buried there.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=210–11}}

[[Clovis I|Clovis the Frank]], the first king of the [[Merovingian dynasty]], made the city his capital from 508.<ref>Patrick Boucheron,  et al., eds. ''France in the World: A New Global History'' (2019) pp 81–86.</ref>  As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the [[Franks]] to Paris and the Parisian [[Francien]] dialects were born. Fortification of the [[Île de la Cité]] failed to avert [[Siege of Paris (845)|sacking by Vikings in 845]], but Paris' strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the [[Siege of Paris (885–86)]], for which the then [[Count of Paris]] (''comte de Paris''), [[Odo of France]], was elected king of [[West Francia]].{{sfn|Jones|1994|p=48}} From the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] dynasty that began with the 987 election of [[Hugh Capet]], Count of Paris and [[Duke of the Franks]] (''duc des Francs''), as king of a unified Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=210–11}}

=== Middle Ages to Louis XIV ===
{{See also|Paris in the Middle Ages|Paris in the 16th century|Paris in the 17th century}}
[[File:Palais de la Cite.jpg|alt=The Palais de la Cité and Sainte-Chapelle, viewed from the Left Bank, from the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (month of June) (1410)|thumb|left|The [[Palais de la Cité]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle]], viewed from the Left Bank, from the [[Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]] (month of June) (1410)]]

By the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=27}} The [[Palais de la Cité]], the royal residence, was located at the western end of the Île de la Cité. In 1163, during the reign of [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], [[Maurice de Sully]], bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] at its eastern extremity.

After the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in around the 10th century,{{sfn|Bussmann|1985|p=22}} Paris' cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's [[Les Halles]]) replaced the two smaller ones on the [[Île de la Cité]] and [[Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville – Esplanade de la Libération|Place de la Grève (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville)]].{{sfn|de Vitriaco|Hinnebusch|1972|p=262}} The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris' first municipal government.

In the late 12th century, [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] extended the [[Louvre]] fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|pp=36–40}} In 1190, he transformed Paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the [[University of Paris]] and would draw students from all of Europe.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=27}}

With 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants.<ref name=ParisDigest>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/history/paris_history.htm |title=Paris history facts |year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906195637/https://www.parisdigest.com/history/paris_history.htm |archive-date=6 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:Paris Hotel de Sens dsc04028.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Hôtel de Sens]], one of many remnants of the Middle Ages in Paris]]
During the [[Hundred Years' War]], Paris was occupied by England-friendly [[Burgundian State|Burgundian forces]] from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when [[Henry V of England]] entered the French capital in 1420;<ref>Du Fresne de Beaucourt, G., ''Histoire de Charles VII'', Tome I: ''Le Dauphin'' (1403–1422), Librairie de la Société bibliographiqque, 35 Rue de Grenelle, Paris, 1881, pp. 32 & 48</ref> in spite of a 1429 effort by [[Joan of Arc]] to liberate the city,{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=52–53}} it would remain under English occupation until 1436.

In the late 16th-century [[French Wars of Religion]], Paris was a stronghold of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], the organisers of 24 August 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in which thousands of French Protestants were killed.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/516821/Massacre-of-Saint-Bartholomews-Day|title=Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=23 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150458/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/516821/Massacre-of-Saint-Bartholomews-Day|archive-date=4 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Bayrou|1994|pp=121–30}} The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris' first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the [[Pont Neuf]], built a Louvre extension connecting it to the [[Tuileries Palace]], and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now [[Place des Vosges]]. In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris' streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near [[Les Halles]] marketplace in 1610.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=577}}

During the 17th century, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], chief minister of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the [[College of Sorbonne]], and a palace for himself, the [[Palais-Royal|Palais-Cardinal]], which he bequeathed to Louis XIII. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the [[Palais-Royal]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=582}}

Due to the Parisian uprisings during the [[Fronde]] civil war, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] moved his court to a new palace, [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the [[Comédie-Française]], the Academy of Painting, and the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the [[City walls of Paris|city walls]] demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the ''[[Boulevards of Paris#The grands boulevards|Grands Boulevards]]'' of today.{{Sfn|Combeau|2003|pp=42–43}} Other marks of his reign were the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]], the [[Place Vendôme]], the [[Place des Victoires]], and [[Les Invalides]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pp=590–91}}

Paris was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity known as the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] published their ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' in 1751, and the [[Montgolfier Brothers]] launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the gardens of the [[Château de la Muette]]. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, the primary European centre of book publishing and fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|p=120}}
[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|alt=|thumb|The storming of the [[Bastille]] on 14 July 1789, by [[Jean-Pierre Houël]]]]

On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the [[Invalides]], acquiring thousands of guns, and [[storming of the Bastille|stormed the Bastille]], a symbol of royal authority. The first independent [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]], or city council, met in the ''Hôtel de Ville'' and, on 15 July, elected a [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]], the astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]].{{sfn|Paine|1998|p=453}}

Louis XVI and the royal family [[Women's march on Versailles|were brought to Paris]] and made prisoners within the Tuileries Palace.

During the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]], the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names, but the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 in Paris, (commemorated by the [[July Column]] on [[Place de la Bastille]]), brought a constitutional monarch, [[Louis Philippe I]], to power. The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the [[Provinces of France|provinces]] to the city.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|p=148}}
Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848. His successor, [[Napoleon III]], and the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers, and parks, including the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and [[Bois de Vincennes]].{{sfn|De Moncan|2012|pp=7–35}} In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.{{sfn|De Moncan|2012|pp=7–35}}

During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871), Paris was besieged by the [[Prussian Army]]. After months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. On 28 March, a revolutionary government called the [[Paris Commune]] seized power in Paris.

In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the [[Algerian War]] for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens).

For almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=334}} The first modern elected mayor of Paris was [[Jacques Chirac]], elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1793.

The mayor of Paris is [[indirect election|elected indirectly]] by Paris voters; the voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the ''[[Conseil de Paris]]'' (Council of Paris), which subsequently elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members, with each arrondissement allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 34 members for the most populated (the 15th). The council is elected using [[closed list]] [[proportional representation]] in a [[two-round system]].<ref name="Pariscouncil">{{cite web|title=Election Preview: France Municipal Elections 2014 – Part I|url=https://welections.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/election-preview-france-municipal-elections-2014-part-i/|website=World Elections|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>  Party lists winning an [[absolute majority]] in the first round – or at least a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] in the second round – automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement.<ref name="Pariscouncil"/>  The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote using the [[highest averages method]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070239&idArticle=LEGIARTI000006353607&dateTexte=20141108 |title=Code électoral – Article L260 |language=fr |trans-title=Election Code – Article L260 |date=13 March 1983 |publisher=Legifrance |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>  This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they don't win an absolute majority of the vote.<ref name="Pariscouncil"/>

Once elected, the council plays a largely passive role in the city government, primarily because it meets only once a month. The council is divided between a coalition of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and extreme left; and 71 members for the centre-right, plus a few members from smaller parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/politiques/Portal.lut?page_id=6731&elected_official_directory_id=-1&document_id=&portal_component=20&document_type_id=6&seq=0&actorlastname=&actorgender=&actormandate=&actorpoliticalgroupid=&actordistrictnumber=&detailed_search=Afficher+les+r%E9sultats |title=List of members of the Council of Paris |publisher=City of Paris |accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>

Each of Paris' 20 arrondissements has its own town hall and a directly elected council (''conseil d'arrondissement''), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor.{{sfn|Shales|2007|p=16}} The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. There are a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=334}}

The budget of the city for 2018 is 9.5 billion Euros, with an expected deficit of 5.5 billion Euros. 7.9 billion Euros are designated for city administration, and 1.7 billion Euros for investment. The number of city employees increased from 40,000 in 2001 to 55,000 in 2018. The largest part of the investment budget is earmarked for public housing (262 million Euros) and for real estate (142 million Euros).<ref>''Le Parisien'', 3 April 2018</ref>

=== Regional government ===
The Region of [[Île de France]], including Paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the Regional Council, which has its headquarters in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It is composed of 209 members representing the different communes within the region. On 15 December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by [[Valérie Pécresse]], narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iledefrance.fr/fil-actus-region/regionales-2015-chiffres-cles-du-scrutin |title=Régionales 2015 : les chiffres clés du scrutin |language=fr |trans-title=Results of 2015 Regional Elections |publisher=Regional Council of Île-de-France |date=15 December 2015 |accessdate=16 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219075856/http://www.iledefrance.fr/fil-actus-region/regionales-2015-chiffres-cles-du-scrutin |archive-date=19 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

As the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's [[Government of France|national government]].

=== Police force ===
[[File:Gendarmerie BMW R1100RT.jpg|thumb|Police (Gendarmerie) motorcyclists in Paris]]
The security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the [[Prefecture of Police of Paris]], a subdivision of the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]]. It supervises the units of the [[National Police (France)|National Police]] who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the [[Paris Fire Brigade]]. Its headquarters is on [[Place Louis Lépine]] on the [[Île de la Cité]].<ref name="Presentation Generale">{{cite web |url=http://www.police-nationale.interieur.gouv.fr/Presentation-generale |title=Présentation générale |trans-title=General Presentation |publisher=Police nationale — Ministère de l'intèrieur [National Police — Ministry of the Interior] |language=fr |accessdate=22 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308061047/http://www.police-nationale.interieur.gouv.fr/Presentation-generale |archive-date=8 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

There are 30,200 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters.<ref name="Presentation Generale"/> The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité]] (CRS), a unit formed in 1944 right after the liberation of France. Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events.

The police are supported by the [[National Gendarmerie]], a branch of the [[French Armed Forces]], though their police operations now are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior. The traditional [[kepi]]s of the gendarmes were replaced in 2002 with caps, and the force modernised, though they still wear kepis for ceremonial occasions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr |title=Accueil |language=fr |trans-title=Home |publisher=Gendarmerie nationale — Ministère de l'intèrieur [National Gendarmerie — Ministry of the Interior] |accessdate=22 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226055256/http://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/ |archive-date=26 December 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.<ref>{{cite web |title=France |website=Travel.State.Gov |publisher=U.S. Department of State |url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/france.html |access-date=4 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404010203/https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/france.html |archive-date=4 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Most French rulers since the Middle Ages made a point of leaving their mark on a city that, contrary to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paris Street Evolution|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02153|website=Nature.com|accessdate=4 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013120325/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02153|archive-date=13 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the [[Seine]]; of those, two remain today: the [[Île Saint-Louis]] and the [[Île de la Cité]]. A third one is the 1827 artificially created [[Île aux Cygnes]].

[[File:Camille Pissarro - Boulevard Montmartre - Eremitage.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Boulevard Montmartre'', 1897, [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
Modern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to [[Napoleon III]] and his Prefect of the Seine, [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]]. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey "[[Paris stone]]". They also built the major parks around the city centre.<ref>De Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris de Haussmann'', Les Éditions de Mecene, Paris, {{ISBN|978-2-907970-98-3}}</ref> The high residential population of its city centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities.{{sfn|Braimoh|Vlek|2008|p=12}}

Parisian examples of European architecture date back more than a millennium, including the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] (1014–1163), the early [[Gothic Architecture]] of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1144), the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] (1163–1345), the [[Flamboyant Gothic]] of [[Saint Chapelle]] (1239–1248), the [[Baroque]] churches of [[Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis]] (1627–1641) and [[Les Invalides]] (1670–1708). The 19th century produced the neoclassical church of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]] (1808–1842), the [[Palais Garnier]] serving as an opera house (1875), the neo-Byzantine [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Basilica of Sacré-Cœur]] (1875–1919), as well as the exuberant ''[[Belle Époque]]'' modernism of the [[Eiffel Tower]] (1889). Striking examples of 20th-century architecture include the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] by [[Richard Rogers]] and [[Renzo Piano]] (1977), the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] by various architects (1986), the [[Arab World Institute]] by [[Jean Nouvel]] (1987), the [[Louvre Pyramid]] by [[I. M. Pei]] (1989) and the [[Opéra Bastille]] by [[Carlos Ott]] (1989). Contemporary architecture includes the [[Musée du quai Branly – Jacques Chirac]] by [[Jean Nouvel]] (2006), the contemporary art museum of the [[Louis Vuitton Foundation]] by [[Frank Gehry]] (2014)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-28/fondation-louis-vuitton-designed-by-frank-gehry-opens-in-paris |title=Inside Frank Gehry's Spectacular Louis Vuitton Foundation |work=Business Week |publisher=Bloomberg |date=28 October 2014 |accessdate=25 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115123541/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-28/fondation-louis-vuitton-designed-by-frank-gehry-opens-in-paris |archive-date=15 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the new [[Tribunal de grande instance de Paris]] by [[Renzo Piano]] (2018).

=== Paris and its suburbs ===

Aside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris' administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative [[Seine (department)|Seine]] department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. This problem was 'resolved' when its parent "District de la région parisienne" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed "[[Île-de-France]]" in 1977, but this abbreviated "Paris region" name is still commonly used today to describe the Île-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.driea.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Chapitre5_de_Breve_histoire_de_amenagement_de_Paris_DREIF_Auteur_Claude_Cottour_cle0344bc.pdf |title=Une brève histoire de l'aménagement de Paris et sa région Du District à la Région Île-de-France |accessdate=26 November 2014 |publisher=DRIEA Île-de-France |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101005621/http://www.driea.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Chapitre5_de_Breve_histoire_de_amenagement_de_Paris_DREIF_Auteur_Claude_Cottour_cle0344bc.pdf |archive-date=1 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the Métropole du [[Grand Paris]] came into existence.<ref name=MGP>{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000028528695&dateTexte=vig |title=Code général des collectivités territoriales – Article L5219-1 |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Legifrance |language=fr |trans-title=General Code of Territorial Communities – Article L5219-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101095821/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000028528695&dateTexte=vig |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Paris' disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth. [[Paul Delouvrier]] promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs ''mésentente'' when he became head of the Paris region in 1961:{{sfn|Masson|1984|p=536}} two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban "villes nouvelles" ("new cities"){{sfn|Yarri|2008|p=407}} and the [[Réseau Express Régional|RER]] commuter train network.{{sfn|Gordon|2006|pp=46–47}} Many other suburban residential districts (''grands ensembles'') were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population:{{sfn|Castells|1983|p=75}} These districts were socially mixed at first,{{sfn|Tomas|Blanc|Bonilla|IERP|2003|p=237}} but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s).<ref name="villes nouvelles">{{cite web|url=http://www.laburba.fr/app/download/7815645/Article+villes+nouvelles.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326035711/http://www.laburba.fr/app/download/7815645/Article%2Bvilles%2Bnouvelles.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2016 |title=Les Politiques Nationales du Logement et le Logement dans les Villes Nouvelles |publisher=Laburba.fr |accessdate=25 November 2014 |page=6 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.<ref name="villes nouvelles"/>

These areas, ''quartiers sensibles'' ("sensitive quarters"), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its [[Goutte d'Or]] and [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] neighbourhoods.

The Paris agglomeration's [[urban sociology]] is basically that of 19th-century Paris: its fortuned classes are situated in its west and southwest, and its middle-to-lower classes are in its north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class citizenry dotted with islands of fortuned populations located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]] to the east and [[Enghien-les-Bains]] to the north of Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=20&ref_id=20529&page=alapage/alap414/alap414_carte.htm#carte1 |title=Une forte hétérogénéité des revenus en Île-de-France |publisher=INSEE |accessdate=26 November 2014 |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229014922/http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=20&ref_id=20529&page=alapage%2Falap414%2Falap414_carte.htm#carte1 |archive-date=29 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|Demographics of Paris}}
{{Collapsible Table Paris Region top countries & territories of birth}}
The official estimated population of the City of Paris was 2,206,488 as of 1 January 2019, according to the [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]], the official French statistical agency. This is a decline of 59,648 from 2015, close to the total population of the 5th arrondissement.<ref name="Le Monde, 22 January 2019">''Le Monde'', 22 January 2019</ref>  Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.<ref name="Le Monde, 22 January 2019"/> This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, to the departure of middle-class residents. and partly to the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Paris perd ses habitants, la faute à la démographie et aux... meublés touristiques pour la Ville." ''Le Parisien'', 28 December 2017</ref>

Paris is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following [[Berlin]], [[Madrid]] and [[Rome]]. [[Eurostat]] places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls "urban audit core cities".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Statistics_on_European_cities |title=Statistics on European cities |publisher=Eurostat |accessdate=28 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114142816/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Statistics_on_European_cities |archive-date=14 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.<ref>[http://cassini.ehess.fr/cassini/fr/html/fiche.php?select_resultat=26207 Données Cassini], EHESS</ref> The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included [[de-industrialisation]], high rent, the [[gentrification]] of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017.<ref name="pophis">{{cite web |url=https://insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4515315?sommaire=4515349&geo=COM-75056 |title=Population en historique depuis 1968: Commune de Paris (75056)|author=Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques|accessdate=11 September 2020 |language=fr |df=dmy-all|author-link=INSEE}}</ref> It declined again in 2018.

According to the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the City of Paris were immigrants from [[Europe]], 112,369 were immigrants from the [[Maghreb]], 70,852 from [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Egypt]], 5,059 from [[Turkey]], 91,297 from [[Asia]] (outside Turkey), 38,858 from the [[Americas]], and 1,365 from the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau_local.asp?ref_id=IMG1B&millesime=2012&niveau=2&nivgeo=DEP&codgeo=75|title=Les immigrés par sexe, âge et pays de naissance – Département de Paris (75)|author=INSEE|accessdate=19 November 2015|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101095821/http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau_local.asp?ref_id=IMG1B&millesime=2012&niveau=2&nivgeo=DEP&codgeo=75|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Note that the immigrants from the Americas and the South Pacific in Paris are vastly outnumbered by migrants from French overseas regions and territories located in these regions of the world.<ref name=RP_68_12/>

The Paris Region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 ''pôles d'emplois'' or business districts.

The second-largest business district in terms of employment is [[La Défense]], just west of the city, where many companies installed their offices in the 1990s. In 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. Two other important districts, [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] and [[Levallois-Perret]], are extensions of the Paris business district and of La Défense. Another district, including [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]] and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement, is a centre of activity for the media and information technology.<ref name="INSEE" />

For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the "City of Art".{{sfn|Montclos|2003}} Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the [[French Baroque and Classicism]] era. Sculptors such as [[François Girardon|Girardon]], [[Antoine Coysevox|Coysevox]] and [[Nicolas Coustou|Coustou]] acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. [[Pierre Mignard]] became the first painter to King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] during this period. In 1648, the ''[[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]]'' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}}

Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and others. The French Revolution and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Paris was central to the development of [[Romanticism]] in art, with painters such as [[Gericault]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} [[Impressionism]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]] and [[Art Deco]] movements all evolved in Paris.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves.{{sfn|Perry|1995|p=19}} Artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and many others became associated with Paris. Picasso, living in [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] in [[Montmartre]], painted his famous ''[[Family of Saltimbanques|La Famille de Saltimbanques]]'' and ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' between 1905 and 1907.<ref>''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'', p. 68.</ref> Montmartre and [[Montparnasse]] became centres for artistic production.

The most prestigious names of French and foreign sculptors, who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era, are [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]] ([[Statue of Liberty]] – ''Liberty Enlightening the World''), [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Camille Claudel]], [[Antoine Bourdelle]], [[Paul Landowski]] (statue of [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|''Christ the Redeemer'']] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]) and [[Aristide Maillol]]. The [[Belle Époque|Golden Age]] of the [[School of Paris]] ended between the two world wars.

=== Photography ===
The inventor [[Nicéphore Niépce]] produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825. In 1839, after the death of Niépce, [[Louis Daguerre]] patented the [[Daguerrotype]], which became the most common form of photography until the 1860s. {{sfn|Michelin|2011}} The work of [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of [[Man Ray]] and [[Maurice Tabard]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/phsr/hd_phsr.htm Department of Photographs, ''Photography and Surrealism'', Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213005005/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/phsr/hd_phsr.htm |date=13 February 2015 }}, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2000.</ref>{{sfn|Hazan|2011|p=362}} Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including [[Eugène Atget]], noted for his depictions of street scenes, [[Robert Doisneau]], noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which ''Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville'' has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), [[Marcel Bovis]], noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as [[Jacques-Henri Lartigue]] and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} [[Poster art]] also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Jules Chéret]], [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Adolphe Willette]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges de Feure]], [[Henri-Gabriel Ibels]], [[Paul Gavarni]] and [[Alphonse Mucha]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}}

=== Theatre ===
[[File:Opéra Bastille.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Opéra Bastille]]]]
The largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Opéra Garnier (historical [[Opéra National de Paris|Paris Opéra]]) and modern [[Opéra Bastille]]; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=178}} In middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Opéra-Comique (which still exists), [[Théâtre-Italien]] and [[Théâtre Lyrique]] (which in modern times changed its profile and name to [[Théâtre de la Ville]]).{{Sfn|Schumacher|1996|p=60}} [[Philharmonie de Paris]], the modern symphonic concert hall of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], where the first performances of Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]] took place in 1913.
[[File:CFfacadePlacedelOpera.png|thumb|The [[Comédie Française]] (Salle Richelieu)]]

Theatre traditionally has occupied a large place in Parisian culture, and many of its most popular actors today are also stars of French television. The oldest and most famous Paris theatre is the [[Comédie-Française]], founded in 1680. Run by the Government of France, it performs mostly French classics at the Salle Richelieu in the [[Palais-Royal]] at 2 rue de Richelieu, next to the Louvre.{{Sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1173}} of Other famous theatres include the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe]], next to the Luxembourg Gardens, also a state institution and theatrical landmark; the Théâtre Mogador, and the [[Théâtre de la Gaîté-Montparnasse]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Who's Where|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tj4WAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2 July 2013|year=1961|page=304|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907162159/http://books.google.com/books?id=Tj4WAQAAIAAJ|archive-date=7 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

The music hall and [[cabaret]] are famous Paris institutions. The ''[[Moulin Rouge]]'' was opened in 1889. It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French [[Cancan]]. It helped make famous the singers [[Mistinguett]] and [[Édith Piaf]] and the painter [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall [[Olympia Paris]] invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the ''[[Folies Bergère]]''. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer [[Josephine Baker]]. Later, Olympia Paris presented [[Dalida]], [[Edith Piaf]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Judy Garland]] and the [[Grateful Dead]].

The [[Casino de Paris]] presented many famous French singers, including [[Mistinguett]], [[Maurice Chevalier]] and [[Tino Rossi]]. Other famous Paris music halls include ''[[Le Lido]]'', on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the [[Crazy Horse (cabaret)|Crazy Horse Saloon]], featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city.{{Sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1005–06}}

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Writers in Paris}}
[[File:Victor Hugo by Étienne Carjat 1876 - full.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Victor Hugo]]]]
The first book printed in France, ''Epistolae'' ("Letters"), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino da Barzizza), was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by [[Johann Heynlin]]. Since then, Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Almost all the books published in Paris in the Middle Ages were in Latin, rather than French. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as [[Nicolas Boileau|Boileau]], [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[La Fontaine]], [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], several coming from the provinces, as well as the foundation of the [[Académie française]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=488}} In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the cafés and salons; it was dominated by [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Pierre de Marivaux]] and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]].

During the 19th century, Paris was the home and subject for some of France's greatest writers, including [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Mérimée]], [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Émile Zola]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Guy de Maupassant]] and [[Honoré de Balzac]].

Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and, in the 1970s, [[Milan Kundera]].

Paris is a city of books and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language publishing houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=840}} It is also a city of small bookstores. There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.<ref>"The French Still Flock to Bookstores", ''New York Times'', 20 June 2012</ref>

In the late 12th century, a school of [[polyphony]] was established at Notre-Dame. Among the [[Trouvères]] of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. [[Troubadours]], from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of [[Francis I of France|François I]], in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance era]], the [[lute]] became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers "disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy", and a national musical printing house was established.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} In the [[Baroque music|Baroque-era]], noted composers included [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], and [[François Couperin]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} The [[Conservatoire de Paris|''Conservatoire de Musique de Paris'']] was founded in 1795.{{sfn|Damschroeder|Williams|1990|p=157}} By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music.

[[Bal-musette]] is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city.{{sfn|Dregni|2004|p=19}} Patrons danced the [[bourrée]] to the accompaniment of the [[cabrette]] (a [[bellows]]-blown [[bagpipe]] locally called a "musette") and often the [[vielle à roue]] ([[hurdy-gurdy]]) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the [[accordion]] adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement,{{sfn|Dregni|2008|p=32}} and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city.

Immediately after the War the [[Saint-Germain-des-Pres]] quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars because of a lack of space; these included the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, [[Le Tabou]]. They introduced Parisians to the music of [[Claude Luter]], [[Boris Vian]], [[Sydney Bechet]], [[Mezz Mezzrow]], and [[Henri Salvador]].

Parisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world's global cities, with cinemas primarily dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. [[Cinema of France|French cinema]] comes a close second, with major directors (''réalisateurs'') such as [[Claude Lelouch]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and [[Luc Besson]], and the more slapstick/popular genre with director [[Claude Zidi]] as an example.

Since the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants and ''[[haute cuisine]]'', food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the [[Palais-Royal]] by [[Antoine Beauvilliers]]; it featured an elegant dining room, an extensive menu, linen tablecloths, a large wine list and well-trained waiters; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant [[Le Grand Véfour]] in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pp=1136–38}} The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the [[Au Rocher de Cancale|Rocher de Cancale]], the [[Café Anglais]], [[Maison dorée (Paris)|Maison Dorée]] and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the [[Boulevard des Italiens]]; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and [[Émile Zola]]. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the ''[[Belle Epoque]]'', including [[Maxim's Paris|Maxim's]] on Rue Royale, [[Ledoyen]] in the gardens of the [[Champs-Élysées]], and the [[Tour d'Argent]] on the Quai de la Tournelle.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=1137}}

Today, due to Paris' cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants.{{sfn|Dominé|2014}} The [[Michelin Guide]] has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2018, of the 27 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, ten are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as [[L'Ambroisie]] in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as [[L'Astrance]], which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France's most famous chefs, including [[Pierre Gagnaire]], [[Alain Ducasse]], [[Yannick Alléno]] and [[Alain Passard]], have three-star restaurants in Paris.<ref>''Le Monde'', 2 February 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://restaurant.michelin.fr|title=Michelin Guide|publisher=[[Michelin Guide]]|accessdate=23 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125110232/http://restaurant.michelin.fr/|archive-date=25 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Lesdeuxmagots.jpg|thumb|[[Les Deux Magots]] café on Boulevard Saint-Germain]]
In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The [[Coffeehouse|café]] arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The [[Café Procope]] on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially [[Café de la Rotonde]] and [[Le Dôme Café]] in Montparnasse and [[Café de Flore]] and [[Les Deux Magots]] on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=1137}} A [[bistro]] is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; "bistro" means "quickly" in [[Russian language|Russian]], and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=715}} A [[brasserie]] originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the [[Paris Exposition of 1867]]; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=773}}

The [[University of Paris]], founded in the 12th century, is often called the [[Sorbonne]] after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.{{sfn|Combeau|2013|pages=213–14}}[[File:Maison des sciences de l'homme, 54 boulevard Raspail, Paris 6e 1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]] (EHESS), France's most prestigious university in the social sciences, is headquartered in the 6th arrondissement.]]
The Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the ''[[grandes écoles]]'' – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered ''[[grands établissements]]''. Most of the ''grandes écoles'' were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris, though the [[École Normale Supérieure]] has remained on rue d'Ulm in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ens.fr/spip.php?article171&lang=en|title=Contact and Maps|accessdate=18 June 2013|language=fr|publisher=[[École Normale Supérieure]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607052638/http://www.ens.fr/spip.php?article171&lang=en|archive-date=7 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are a high number of engineering schools, led by the [[ParisTech|Paris Institute of Technology]] which comprises several colleges such as [[École Polytechnique]], [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris|École des Mines]], [[AgroParisTech]], [[École nationale supérieure des télécommunications|Télécom Paris]], [[École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers|Arts et Métiers]], and [[École nationale des ponts et chaussées|École des Ponts et Chaussées]].

Since the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's Métro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/c_5043/metro/|title=Métro2030, notre nouveau métro de Paris|publisher=RATP|accessdate=27 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101095822/http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/c_5043/metro/|archive-date=1 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> through 16 lines, 303 stations (385 stops) and {{convert|220|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines (A, B, C, D, and E), 257 stops and {{convert|587|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|pp=278–83}}

Over €26.5 billion will be invested over the next 15 years to extend the Métro network into the suburbs,{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|pp=278–83}} with notably the [[Grand Paris Express]] project.

In addition, the [[Île-de-France|Paris region]] is served by a light rail network of nine lines, the tramway: [[Île-de-France tramway Line 1|Line T1]] runs from Asnières-Gennevilliers to Noisy-le-Sec, [[Île-de-France tramway Line 2|Line T2]] runs from Pont de Bezons to Porte de Versailles, [[Île-de-France tramway Lines 3a and 3b|Line T3a]] runs from Pont du Garigliano to Porte de Vincennes, [[Île-de-France tramway Lines 3a and 3b|Line T3b]] runs from Porte de Vincennes to Porte d'Asnières, [[Île-de-France tramway Line 5|Line T5]] runs from Saint-Denis to Garges-Sarcelles, [[Île-de-France tramway Line 6|Line T6]] runs from Châtillon to Viroflay, [[Île-de-France tramway Line 7|Line T7]] runs from Villejuif to Athis-Mons, [[Île-de-France tramway Line 8|Line T8]] runs from Saint-Denis to Épinay-sur-Seine and Villetaneuse, all of which are operated by the [[RATP Group]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/r_80565/ratps-tram-network-in-ile-de-france/|title=RATP's tram network in Île-de-France|publisher=RATP|accessdate=27 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208071832/http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/r_80565/ratps-tram-network-in-ile-de-france/|archive-date=8 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Île-de-France tramway Line 4|line T4]] runs from Bondy RER to Aulnay-sous-Bois, which is operated by the state rail carrier SNCF.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|pp=278–83}} Five new light rail lines are currently in various stages of development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stif.org/developpements-et-avenir/nouveau-grand-paris/tramway.html|title=tramway|publisher=STIF|accessdate=27 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208180639/http://www.stif.org/developpements-et-avenir/nouveau-grand-paris/tramway.html|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Paris is a major international air transport hub with the [[World's busiest city airport systems by passenger traffic|5th busiest airport system in the world]]. The city is served by three commercial international airports: [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris–Charles de Gaulle]], [[Orly Airport|Paris–Orly]] and [[Beauvais–Tillé Airport]]. Together these three airports recorded traffic of 96.5 million passengers in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/Bulletin_Statistique_2014.pdf|title=Bulletin statistique, trafic aérien commercial – année 2014|page=15|publisher=Direction générale de l'Aviation civile|accessdate=28 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329083555/http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/Bulletin_Statistique_2014.pdf|archive-date=29 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> There is also one [[general aviation]] airport, [[Paris – Le Bourget Airport|Paris-Le Bourget]], historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows.

Orly Airport, located in the southern suburbs of Paris, replaced Le Bourget as the principal airport of Paris from the 1950s to the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/groupe/groupe-et-strategie/histoire/1961_a_1981 |title=Histoire d'Aéroports de Paris de 1945 à 1981 |publisher=[[Aéroports de Paris]] |accessdate=27 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208075947/http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/groupe/groupe-et-strategie/histoire/1961_a_1981 |archive-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.side.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/EXPLOITATION/DEFAULT/doc/IFD/IFD_REFDOC_TEMIS_0077449/trafic-aeroportuaire-1986-2012-flux-de-trafic-commercial-1986-2012 |title=Trafic aéroportuaire 1986–2013 |pages=15–17 |publisher=Direction générale de l'Aviation civile |accessdate=27 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170444/http://www.side.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/EXPLOITATION/DEFAULT/doc/IFD/IFD_REFDOC_TEMIS_0077449/trafic-aeroportuaire-1986-2012-flux-de-trafic-commercial-1986-2012 |archive-date=5 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> For the year 2017 it was the [[World's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|5th busiest airport in the world by international traffic]] and it is the hub for the nation's [[flag carrier]] [[Air France]].{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|pp=278–83}} Beauvais-Tillé Airport, located {{convert|69|km|abbr=off}} north of Paris' city centre, is used by charter airlines and [[low-cost carriers]] such as [[Ryanair]].

Domestically, air travel between Paris and some of France's largest cities such as [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], or [[Strasbourg]] has been in a large measure replaced by [[high-speed rail]] due to the opening of several high-speed [[TGV]] rail lines from the 1980s. For example, after the [[LGV Méditerranée]] opened in 2001, air traffic between Paris and Marseille declined from 2,976,793 passengers in 2000 to 1,502,196 passengers in 2014.<ref name=domestic>{{cite web|title=Air passenger transport between the main airports of France and their main partner airports (routes data)|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=avia_par_fr&lang=en|author=Eurostat|accessdate=29 November 2015|author-link=Eurostat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094738/http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=avia_par_fr&lang=en|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> After the [[LGV Est]] opened in 2007, air traffic between Paris and Strasbourg declined from 1,006,327 passengers in 2006 to 157,207 passengers in 2014.<ref name=domestic/>

==== Motorways ====
[[File:ParisRingRoads A104.svg|thumb|left|Ring roads of Paris]]
The city is also the most important hub of France's [[motorway]] network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the [[Périphérique (Paris)|Périphérique]],{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=69}} which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the [[A86 autoroute|A86]] motorway in the inner suburbs, and finally the [[Francilienne]] motorway in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over {{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of highways and motorways.

==== Waterways ====
The Paris region is the most active water transport area in France, with most of the cargo handled by [[Autonomous Port of Paris|Ports of Paris]] in facilities located around Paris. The rivers Loire, Rhine, Rhone, Meuse, and Scheldt can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the [[Canal Saint-Martin]], [[Canal Saint-Denis]], and the Canal de l'Ourcq.{{sfn|Jefferson|2009|p=114}}

==== Cycling ====
[[File:Station Velib DSC 3497.JPG|thumb|right|[[Vélib']] at the [[Place de la Bastille]]]]
There are {{convert|440|km|abbr=on}} of [[Cycling in Paris|cycle paths and routes]] in Paris. These include ''piste cyclable'' (bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers such as a kerb) and ''bande cyclable'' (a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Some {{convert|29|km|abbr=on}} of specially marked bus lanes are free to be used by cyclists, with a protective barrier protecting against encroachments from vehicles.{{sfn|Hart|2004|p=355}} Cyclists have also been given the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris offers a [[community bicycle program|bike sharing]] system called [[Vélib']] with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations,{{sfn|Rand|2010|p=165}} which can be rented for short and medium distances including [[One-way traffic|one way]] trips.

=== Electricity ===
Electricity is provided to Paris through a peripheral grid fed by multiple sources. {{As of|2012}}, around 50% of electricity generated in the [[Île-de-France]] comes from cogeneration energy plants located near the outer limits of the [[Regions of France|region]]; other energy sources include the [[Nogent Nuclear Power Plant]] (35%), trash incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 GWh).<ref name="prod_electrique_IDF">{{cite web |url=http://www.driee.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Seminaire_du_6_mars_2012_-_Presentations_Approvisionnement_electrique_du_Grand_Paris__cle2dcb2f-1.pdf |title=La production électrique en IdF |publisher=La DRIEE – Prefet de la région d'Île-de-France |accessdate=11 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007034916/http://www.driee.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Seminaire_du_6_mars_2012_-_Presentations_Approvisionnement_electrique_du_Grand_Paris__cle2dcb2f-1.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> A quarter of the city's [[district heating]] is to come from a plant in [[Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine]], burning a 50/50-mix of coal and 140,000 tonnes of [[wood pellets]] from the United States per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwoodmarketsinfo.com/paris-to-import-wood-pellets-from-the-us/|title=Paris to be heated with US wood pellets|work=Global Wood Markets Info|access-date=11 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312072201/http://www.globalwoodmarketsinfo.com/paris-to-import-wood-pellets-from-the-us/|archive-date=12 March 2016|url-status=live|date=11 March 2016}}</ref>

=== Water and sanitation ===
[[File:Ile de la Cite from Pont de la Tournelle.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Seine, the [[Île de la Cité]] and a [[Bateau Mouche]]]]
Paris in its early history had only the rivers Seine and [[Bièvre (river)|Bièvre]] for water. From 1809, the [[Canal de l'Ourcq]] provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/pratique/musees-expos/musee-des-egouts/visite-publique-des-egouts-de-paris/rub_9691_stand_5943_port_23931|title=Historique des égouts|accessdate=18 June 2013|language=fr|publisher=Paris.fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410232647/http://www.paris.fr/pratique/musees-expos/musee-des-egouts/visite-publique-des-egouts-de-paris/rub_9691_stand_5943_port_23931|archive-date=10 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> From 1857, the civil engineer [[Eugène Belgrand]], under [[Napoleon III]], oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the Capital's highest points of elevation.{{sfn|Burchell|1971|p=93}} From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris' principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris' streets.

Between 1853 and 1870, Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and the city's first director of parks and gardens, [[Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand]], created the [[Bois de Boulogne]], [[Bois de Vincennes]], [[Parc Montsouris]] and [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]], located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters.{{Sfn|Jarrassé|2007|pp=122–61}} Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the [[Parc de la Villette]] (1987), [[Parc André Citroën]] (1992), [[Parc de Bercy]] (1997) and [[Parc Clichy-Batignolles – Martin-Luther-King|Parc Clichy-Batignolles]] (2007).{{Sfn|Jarrassé|2007|pp=242–56}} One of the newest parks, the [[Promenade des Berges de la Seine]] (2013), built on a former highway on the [[Rive Gauche|left bank]] of the Seine between the [[Pont de l'Alma]] and the [[Musée d'Orsay]], has floating gardens and gives a view of the city's landmarks.

=== Cemeteries ===
[[File:Catacombes De Paris.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Catacombs of Paris|Paris Catacombs]] hold the remains of approximately 6 million people.]]
During the Roman era, the city's main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the [[Rive Gauche|left bank]] settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the [[Holy Innocents' Cemetery]], were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris' parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of [[Mines of Paris|Paris's stone mines]] outside the "Porte d'Enfer" city gate, today [[place Denfert-Rochereau]] in the 14th arrondissement.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=101}}{{sfn|Broadwell|2007|p=92}} The process of moving bones from the ''Cimetière des Innocents'' to the [[Catacombs of Paris|catacombs]] took place between 1786 and 1814;{{sfn|Andia|Brialy|2001|p=221}} part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs.

After a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.{{sfn|Ayers|2004|p=271}} Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of [[Père Lachaise Cemetery|Père Lachaise]], [[Montmartre Cemetery|Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse Cemetery|Montparnasse]], and later [[Passy Cemetery|Passy]]; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the [[Saint-Ouen Cemetery|Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen]], the [[Cimetière parisien de Pantin]] (also known as Cimetière parisien de [[Pantin]]-[[Bobigny]]), the Cimetière parisien d'[[Ivry-sur-Seine|Ivry]], and the Cimetière parisien de [[Bagneux, Hauts-de-Seine|Bagneux]].<ref name="Parisian Cemeteries">{{cite web|title=Les 20 cimetières Parisiens|url=http://www.paris.fr/cimetieres|publisher=Paris.fr|accessdate=4 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170430/http://www.paris.fr/cimetieres|archive-date=5 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Some of the most famous people in the world are buried in Parisian cemeteries, such as [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Serge Gainsbourg]] among others.<ref>{{cite web |title=Les célébrités du cimetière du Père Lachaise à Paris |url=https://www.oui.sncf/article/les-tombes-de-celebrites-au-cimetiere-du-pere-lachaise-106832 |website=www.oui.sncf |language=fr}}</ref>
