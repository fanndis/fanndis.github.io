While her aunt did not have any children of her own, she "loved children, and she was good with them."<ref name=Bassett12>Bassett, Angela (2009), pp. 12-13.</ref>

After her parents' divorce, she relocated from [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], where she and her sister D'nette were raised by their social worker/civil servant mother.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDC1E3FF930A15755C0A965958260 |title=As Tina Turner, Wig to High Heels – |work=The New York Times |date=June 23, 1993 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}</ref> Bassett did not see her father again for several years, until she attended her grandmother's funeral. There, Bassett met his daughter from his first marriage, Jean, who at twelve years old, was several years older than Bassett.<ref name="Bassett18-19" /> After graduating from Jordan Park Elementary School, she began being bused out of her neighborhood to attend Disston Middle School for seventh grade.

In her younger years, Bassett was "in love" with the [[Jackson 5]] and dreamed of marrying a member of the family group, stating it would probably be "whoever had the cutest, roundest Afro at the time. In my imagination we would have children and live in a real house."<ref name="Bassett18-19">Bassett, Angela (2009), pp. 18–19.</ref> As her interest in entertainment developed, Angela and her sister would often put on shows, reading poems or performing popular music for their family.<ref name=Bassett29 />

[[File:Boca Ciega High School.JPG|thumb|right|[[Boca Ciega High School]], where Bassett as a teenager was a member of the debate team and student government among other endeavors.]]
At [[Boca Ciega High School]], Bassett was a cheerleader and a member of the [[Upward Bound]] college prep program, the debate team, student government, drama club and choir. A straight "A" and "B" student for the most part, Bassett got her first "C" in physical education, and tried to get her mother to not feel disappointment in the grade. Bassett called the grade the "average," leading her mother to say she did not have "average kids." As Bassett described, a "sense of pride" developed in her and she did not get another "C" until college.<ref name="Oprah.com" /> During high school, Bassett became the first African-American from Boca Ciega to be admitted to the National Honor Society. She participated in Upward Bound, an academic and cultural enrichment program for underprivileged students. Bassett says she and the other participants did not see themselves as underprivileged.<ref name=Bassett29>Bassett, Angela (2009), pp. 29–31.</ref>

Bassett attended [[Yale University]] and received her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[African-American studies]] in 1980. In 1983, she earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] degree from the [[Yale School of Drama]], despite opposition from her father's sister who warned her to not "waste" her "Yale education on theater." She was the only member of Bassett's family to have gone to both college and graduate school.<ref name="Oprah.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Angela-Bassetts-Aha-Moment|title=Angela Bassett's Aha!

==Career==

===Early work===
In 1985, Bassett made her first television appearance as a prostitute in the made-for-TV movie ''Doubletake''. She made her film debut as a news reporter in ''[[F/X]]'' (1986), for which she was required to join the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG).<ref name=TVGuide>"How Did You Get Your SAG-AFTRA Card?" ''[[TV Guide]]''. January 13, 2014. p. 10.</ref> Bassett moved to Los Angeles in 1988 for more acting jobs<ref name=NewYorkTimes /> and gained recognition in the films ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' (1991) and ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'' (1992). For her portrayal of [[Betty Shabazz]], she earned an [[NAACP Image Award|Image Award]]. Despite the award, the movie was not entirely given positive reception, being referred to by critics as failing to "capture" the rage of [[Autobiography of Malcolm X|Malcolm X's autobiography]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-07-23/entertainment/9307210869_1_autobiography-of-malcolm-malcolm-x-born-malcolm|title='X' Fails To Capture Rage Of Autobiography|date=July 23, 1993|work=Orlando Sentinel|first=Jay|last=Boyar}}</ref> During the production of ''Malcolm X'', Spike Lee showed Bassett a tape of the exact moment when Malcolm X was shot during his assassination, since they would be filming the scene. Bassett called the recording "haunting", but noted that after listening, she was "able to grab hold of the pain and re-create the scene." Bassett felt it was important for her to get the assassination scene correct, and wondered how Betty "found the strength to keep going, to raise her family, to educate, to sustain them."<ref>Bassett, Angela, (2009), pp. 154–155.</ref> ''Malcolm X'' was released on November 18, 1992.

===1990s===
In 1990, Bassett played an airline stewardess alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, a tough cop who went undercover as a kindergarten teacher to crack a case. This became Basset's first movie role.
In 1992, Bassett played [[Katherine Jackson]] in ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]''. Bassett's agents tried to discourage her from playing the role, given the negative reception that [[Michael Jackson]] had. She admitted to not caring about the negative view of members of the Jackson family at the time, citing her childhood fondness of the group as an example of her passion for the project and believed her "instinct" about the role had been correct once learning of the positive reviews the miniseries received after airing.<ref>Bassett, Angela (2009), pp. 152–153.</ref> Bassett had previously idolized the group growing up and said the Jackson family were positive influences on the African-American community for their successes. Bassett had previously worried that after her role as Betty Shabazz in ''Malcolm X'', she would not find another role "as satisfying". Bassett at the time of the film's release expressed her belief that her career would never receive such high-profile roles again. "I think I have been incredibly blessed and it is probably just all downhill from here."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-15/news/tv-621_1_katherine-jackson|title=Her 'American Dream': Angela Bassett Says Playing the Mother of the Jackson's Was Emotional and Uplifting|date=November 15, 1992|first=Susan|last=King|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

She was the first African-American to win the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. Bassett obtained the role after beating [[Halle Berry]] and [[Robin Givens]], but only had a month to prepare before filming began. She met Tina Turner twice, and was given advice by the woman she would be portraying from wigs and outfits to dancing styles. Turner also did Bassett's make up, leading Bassett to call her "supportive" and her "biggest fan."<ref name=NewYorkTimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/23/movies/as-tina-turner-wig-to-high-heels.html|title=As Tina Turner, Wig to High Heels|date=June 23, 1993|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Bassett described to the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' going to one of Turner's concerts and crying profusely. According to Bassett, upon realizing that she knew some of Turner's dance moves, she was "almost a river of tears."<ref name=OSBassett1995 /> Marc Bernardin of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that Bassett "gave the performance of a lifetime" portraying Turner in the biopic.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20483133_20649427_21244221,00.html|title=47.

Bassett starred in three movies in 1995, which were released with varied reactions from critics: ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'', ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'', and ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'' (where she worked with author [[Terry McMillan]]). In ''Strange Days'', Bassett played Lornette "Mace" Mason, a chauffeur and bodyguard. In ''Vampire in Brooklyn'', she played Rita Veder, a tortured cop with a dark secret. She was excited to work with [[Eddie Murphy]] in ''Vampire in Brooklyn'', as well as director [[Wes Craven]].

Bassett described the then-recently filmed party scene and her character in ''Waiting to Exhale'' to the ''Orlando Sentinel''. Bassett said, "The thing is that my character is thinking about how her husband has left her. I have a cigarette in one hand, and I'm drinking. Basically, the four of us are sitting there talking about men and having some fun."<ref name=OSBassett1995>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-12-22/features/9512210048_1_angela-bassett-tears-tina-turner|title=Tough Angela Bassett Is A Real Softy|date=December 22, 1995|work=Orlando Sentinel}}</ref>

===2000s===
In 2000, Bassett turned down the lead role in ''[[Monster's Ball]]'' because of the script's sexual content; the role earned [[Halle Berry]] the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

== Media image ==
Bassett has been noted for portraying real life African-American women, usually smart and strong women. Bassett said in 2001 that she liked those roles and added: "That's the image that I like to put out there, and those are the parts I'm attracted to. But not iron-fist kind of strong, just self-assured. I'm nice too."<ref name=TheGuardian2001 /> She has turned down roles which she viewed as demeaning to her image. "This is a career about images. It's celluloid; they last for ever. I'm a black woman from America. My people were slaves in America, and even though we're free on paper and in law, I'm not going to allow you to enslave me on film, in celluloid, for all to see. And to cross the water, to countries where people will never meet people who look like me. So it becomes a bigger thing than me just becoming a movie star, and me just being on TV. So if you're going to show every black woman as 400lb or every black woman as the prostitute on the street ... But I have always maintained that [the roles] I cannot do because of the way I'm made up, or because of the way I think, I don't begrudge that there is someone else who has no issues with that."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/12/question-time-angela-bassett|date=February 11, 2009|title=Question time: Angela Bassett on why she is drawn to playing strong women|work=The Guardian|first=Hannah|last=Pool|authorlink=Hannah Pool}}</ref>
