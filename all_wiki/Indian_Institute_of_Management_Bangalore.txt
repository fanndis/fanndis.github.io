== History ==
In 1972, a committee headed by [[Ravi J. Matthai]], noting the rising demand for graduates of the first two prestigious IIMs namely [[IIM Calcutta]] and [[IIM Ahmedabad]], recommended the need to have two more IIMs. While the first two IIMs were oriented towards the private sector, it was decided that the new institutions should oriented towards the public sector to cater to its growing needs of management graduates. The Institute at [[Bangalore]] was consequently set up in the following year, designed to cater exclusively to the needs of public sector enterprises.<ref name="IIMReviewCommitteeReport">{{cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |title=Report of IIM Review Committee |author1=RC Bhargava |author2=Ajit Balakrishnan |author3=Anusua Basu |author4=Ram S Tarneja |author5=Ashok Thakur |access-date=19 March 2010 |publisher=Ministry of HRD, Government of India |date=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221200750/http://education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |archivedate=21 December 2010}}</ref> For the proposed institute, the [[Government of Karnataka]] offered {{convert|100|acre}} of land free of cost and a contribution of {{INRconvert|3|m}}. [[T. A. Pai]] and [[N. S. Ramaswamy]] were appointed as Chairman and Director respectively. The institute was inaugurated by [[Indira Gandhi]], the then Prime Minister of India, on 28 October 1973. The institute was started in [[St. Joseph's College of Commerce]], and some other buildings, which were rented on the Langford Road. The new institute came up at the Bannerghatta Road campus in South Bangalore in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/about-iimb/history|title=About IIMB, history|publisher=IIMB|access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref>

The two-year Post Graduate Programme commenced in July 1974 and the first convocation of the institute was held on 10 July 1976 with a total of 48 graduating students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iimb.ac.in/about-institute/history|title=History of IIM Bangalore|publisher=IIMB|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref> On August 27, 1998, the Post Graduate Programme in Software Enterprise Management was launched with an intake 58 students.
