The  '''Trans-Pacific Partnership''' ('''TPP'''), also called the '''Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement''', was a proposed [[trade agreement]] between [[Australia]], [[Brunei]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Peru]], [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], and the [[United States]] signed on 4 February 2016. After the newly elected US president [[Donald Trump]] withdrew the US signature from TPP in January 2017,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/23/news/economy/tpp-trump-china/ |title=Trump's decision to kill TPP leaves door open for China|last=Riley|first=Charles|date=23 January 2017|work=CNN|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> the agreement could not be ratified as required and did not enter into force. The remaining countries negotiated a new trade agreement called [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]], which incorporates most of the provisions of the TPP and which entered into force on 30 December 2018.

The TPP began as an expansion of the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement]] (TPSEP or P4) signed by Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore in 2005. Beginning in 2008, additional countries joined the discussion for a broader agreement: Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the United States, and Vietnam, bringing the negotiating countries to twelve. In January 2017, the United States withdrew from the agreement.<ref>{{cite web|author=Trump, Donald J.|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/25/2017-01845/withdrawal-of-the-united-states-from-the-trans--pacific-partnership-negotiations-and-agreement|title=Withdrawal of the United States From the Trans- Pacific Partnership Negotiations and Agreement|date=25 January 2017|publisher=[[Federal Register]]}}</ref> The other 11 TPP countries agreed in May 2017 to revive it<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/20/tpp-nations-agree-to-pursue-trade-deal-without-us.html |title=TPP nations agree to pursue trade deal without US |last=Shaffer |first=Sri Jegarajah, Craig Dale, Leslie |date=21 May 2017 |work=[[CNBC]] |access-date=21 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/saving-the-trans-pacific-partnership-what-are-the-tpps-prospects-after-the-us |title=Saving the Trans-Pacific Partnership: What are the TPP's prospects after the US withdrawal? |last=hermesauto |date=21 May 2017 |work=The Straits Times |access-date=21 May 2017}}</ref> and reached agreement in January 2018.

Twelve countries participated in negotiations for the TPP: the four parties to the 2005 [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement]] and eight additional countries. All twelve signed the TPP on 4 February 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35480600|title=Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal signed in Auckland|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 February 2016}}</ref> The agreement would have entered into force after ratification by all signatories, if this had occurred within two years. If the agreement had not been ratified by all before 4 February 2018, it would have entered into force after ratification by at least 6 states which together have a GDP of more than 85% of the GDP of all signatories. The withdrawal of the United States from the agreement in January 2017 effectively ended any prospect of the agreement entering into force. In response the remaining parties successfully negotiated a new version of the agreement that lacked the 85% GDP threshold, the [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership|CPTPP]], which entered into force in December 2018.

=== Potential members ===
[[APEC]] members may accede to the TPP, as may any other jurisdiction to which existing TPP members agree. After an application for membership is received, a commission of parties to the treaty negotiates conditions for accession.

The largest economy in the [[Pacific Rim]] not involved in the negotiations is [[China]]. According to the [[Brookings Institution]] in 2013, the most fundamental challenge for the TPP project regarding China was that "it may not constitute a powerful enough enticement to propel China to sign on to these new standards on trade and investment. China so far has reacted by accelerating its own trade initiatives in Asia."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mireya|first1=Solis|title=The Containment Fallacy: China and the TPP|url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2013/05/24-china-transpacific-partnership-solis|website=Brookings Institution|accessdate=26 June 2014|date=30 November 2001}}</ref> In 2013, it was thought China might still be interested in joining the TPP eventually.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Needham|first1=Vicki|title=China's interest grows in joining an Asia-Pacific trade deal|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/1005-trade/322789-chinas-interest-grows-in-joining-an-asia-pacific-trade-deal|work=TheHill.com|date=17 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920192532/http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/1005-trade/322789-chinas-interest-grows-in-joining-an-asia-pacific-trade-deal|archive-date=20 September 2013}}</ref>  An academic analysis has shown that while the TPP would be more successful if China participated in it, the benefits to China are intangible.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Devadason|first1=Evelyn S.|title=The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP): the Chinese perspective|journal=[[Journal of Contemporary China]]|date=17 January 2014|volume=23|issue=87|pages=462–479|doi=10.1080/10670564.2013.843890}}</ref>

=== Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement ===
{{main|Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement}}

Brunei, Chile, Singapore and New Zealand are parties to the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TPSEP), which was signed in 2005, and entered into force in 2006. The original TPSEP agreement contains an accession clause and affirms the members' "commitment to encourage the accession to this Agreement by other economies".<ref name="mfat.govt.nz">{{cite web|url=http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/2-Trade-Relationships-and-Agreements/Trans-Pacific/0-history.php|title=History of the Trans-Pacific SEP Agreement P4|work=mfat.govt.nz|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210151458/http://mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/2-Trade-Relationships-and-Agreements/Trans-Pacific/0-history.php|archive-date=10 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfat.govt.nz/downloads/trade-agreement/transpacific/main-agreement.pdf |title=TRANS-PACIFIC STRATEGIC ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT |work=mfat.govt.nz |accessdate=5 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514005708/http://www.mfat.govt.nz/downloads/trade-agreement/transpacific/main-agreement.pdf |archive-date=14 May 2015  }}</ref> It is a comprehensive agreement, affecting trade in goods, rules of origin, trade remedies, [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures|sanitary and phytosanitary measures]], technical barriers to trade, trade in services, intellectual property, government procurement and competition policy.

Although original and negotiating parties are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), TPSEP is not an APEC initiative. However, the TPP is considered{{by whom|date=April 2019}} to be a pathfinder for the proposed [[Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific]] (FTAAP), an APEC initiative.

=== Original negotiations ===
{{main|Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations}}

In January 2008, the U.S. entered talks with the Pacific 4 (P4) members regarding [[trade liberalisation]] in financial services.<ref name="NZH">{{cite news| url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/3/story.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10491556|title= First step to wider free trade|work= The New Zealand Herald |accessdate= 9 February 2008|first= Chris|last= Daniels|date= 10 February 2008}}</ref> This led to 19 formal negotiation rounds and a subsequent series of additional meetings, such as Chief Negotiators Meetings and Ministers Meetings, and resulted in the agreement announced on 5 October 2015.

=== Ratification of the original agreement ===
The original agreement was ratified by Japan and New Zealand.

Japan's main competition in the region is China, these two nations holding polar views on how South-East Asia's economy should develop.{{Citation needed|reason=What is meant by this?|date=July 2020}} Prior to TPP, Japan tried to achieve dominance by establishing the Asian Monetary Fund (AMF), which the U.S blocked.  By 2011 Japan managed to establish a cooperative agreement with China and Korea called the "PRC–Japan–Republic of Korea Free trade agreement", also known as the CJK FTA, which did not include the U.S.  Japan's intention with this was to use the People's Republic of China card in order to shift TPP negotiations away from China towards Japan's agendas with support of the United States.<ref name="ADB working paper series on regional economic integration">{{cite web|url=https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/152753/reiwp-146.pdf|title=Trans-Pacific Partnership versus Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership: Control of Membership and Agenda setting|author=Shintaro Hamanaka|date=January 2014}}</ref> Ratification in Japan required political reforms that shifted some authority from the agriculture ministry to the prime minister.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ishiguro |first1=Kaoru |title=TPP negotiations and political economy reforms in Japan's executive policy making: a two-level game analysis |journal=International Relations of the Asia-Pacific |date=20 June 2016 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=171–201 |doi=10.1093/irap/lcw010}}</ref>

=== United States withdrawal ===
[[File:Presidential Memorandum Regarding Withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Negotiations and Agreement.pdf|thumb|Presidential Memorandum Regarding Withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Negotiations and Agreement (2017)]]

During a speech on the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential campaign]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee [[Donald Trump]] vowed to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership if elected. He argued that the agreement would "undermine" the U.S. economy and its independence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/28/donald-trump-vows-to-cancel-trans-pacific-partners/|title=Donald Trump vows to cancel Trans-Pacific Partnership as president, puts NAFTA on notice|work=[[The Washington Times]]|access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref><ref name="atlantic-wonthelp">{{cite web|title=TPP's Death Won't Help the American Middle Class|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/tpps-death-wont-help-the-american-middle-class/507683/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=22 January 2017|date=15 November 2016}}</ref> On 21 November 2016, in a video message, Trump introduced an economic strategy of "putting America first", stating that he would negotiate "fair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores."

=== United States public opinion ===
In a 2018 study conducted on general foreign trade, researchers have found that a sizable majority of U.S. adults view foreign trade as conducive to U.S. growth rather than a foreign threat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/228317/positive-attitudes-toward-foreign-trade-stay-high.aspx|title=In U.S., Positive Attitudes Toward Foreign Trade Stay High|last=Inc.|first=Gallup|work=Gallup.com|access-date=23 April 2018|language=en-us}}</ref>  In an international context, Americans generally are among the least likely to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership and a clear partisan divide exists among the U.S. public in supporting the trade deal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/23/americans-favor-tpp-but-less-than-other-countries-do/|title=Americans favor TPP, but less than those in other countries do|date=23 June 2015|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref></p>

President Donald Trump has expressed opposition to the TPP as a tenet of his 2016 election platform, which contributed to his popularity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blendon|first=Robert J.|date=April 2017|title=Public Opinion and Trump's Jobs and Trade Policies|journal=Challenge|volume=60|issue=3|pages=228–244|doi=10.1080/05775132.2017.1308763|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Critics complained that while Trump has worked to contain the economic and geostrategic influence of China, withdrawing from the TPP reduced the effectiveness of a treaty that was designed to do exactly that.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/09/23/arc-trump-administration-bends-toward-stupidity/|title=Perspective &#124; The arc of the Trump administration bends toward stupidity|first=Daniel W.|last=Drezner|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>

=== New negotiations and CPTPP ===
{{main|Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership}} 
TPP's future was uncertain after the United States withdrew. Several signatories, however, signaled their intention to rework TPP without US participation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-asia-idUSKBN15800V|title=After U.S. exit, Asian nations try to save TPP trade deal|date=24 January 2017|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref>

In January 2018, the remaining eleven countries agreed on a revised TPP, now renamed the "[[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]]" (CPTPP). CPTPP is substantially the same as TPP, but omits 20 provisions that had been added to TPP at US insistence and that are now no longer binding.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/world/6-things-to-know-about-the-trans-pacific-trade-pact-cptpp|title=6 things to know about the trans-Pacific trade pact CPTPP |last=hermesauto|date=23 January 2018|work=The Straits Times|access-date=23 January 2018|language=en}}</ref> These provisions primarily relate to investment, [[government procurement]] and [[intellectual property]].<ref>{{cite web|title= TPP11: Unpacking the Suspended Provisions|url= http://www.asiantradecentre.org/talkingtrade//tpp11-unpacking-the-suspended-provisions|website= Asian Trade Centre|accessdate= 23 January 2018}}</ref>

A 2016 study by [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] political scientists Todd Allee and Andrew Lugg finds that out of the 74 previous trade agreements that TPP members signed since 1995, the text of the TPP most resembles that from earlier U.S. trade agreements.<ref name=":24">{{Cite journal|last=Allee|first=Todd|last2=Lugg|first2=Andrew|date=1 July 2016|title=Who wrote the rules for the Trans-Pacific Partnership?|journal=Research & Politics|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|page=2053168016658919|doi=10.1177/2053168016658919|issn=2053-1680|doi-access=free}}</ref> A 2017 study found that the TPP scored high relative to other trade agreements in terms of a government's ability to freely legislate and implement regulations in given public policy domains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broude|first=Tomer|last2=Haftel|first2=Yoram Z.|last3=Thompson|first3=Alexander|date=1 June 2017|title=The Trans-Pacific Partnership and Regulatory Space: A Comparison of Treaty Texts|journal=Journal of International Economic Law|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=391–417|doi=10.1093/jiel/jgx016|issn=1369-3034}}</ref>

In addition, the agreement mandates expedited customs procedures for express shipments and prohibits customs duties from being applied to electronic transmissions. It also requires additional privacy, security, and consumer protections for online transactions and encourages the publication of online customs forms. These provisions are expected to be particularly beneficial to small businesses.<ref name=WSJ11272015 />

=== Environmental protection ===
According to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], the "TPP includes the most robust enforceable environment commitments of any trade agreement in history".<ref name=":20">{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/tpp/#preserving-the-environment|title=The Trans-Pacific Partnership @ USTR.gov|website=The Trans-Pacific Partnership @ USTR.gov|access-date=22 July 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727215845/https://ustr.gov/tpp/#preserving-the-environment|archive-date=27 July 2016}}</ref> The USTR notes that the TPP requires signatories to fulfill their obligations under the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)]] to protect and conserve iconic species.<ref name=":20" /> According to the USTR, TPP is the first trade agreement to prohibit harmful fisheries subsidies, such as those that contribute to [[overfishing]].<ref name=":20" /> The USTR asserts that TPP signatories are required to "combat illegal fishing", "promote sustainable fisheries management practices", and "protect wetlands and important natural areas", "combat wildlife trafficking, [[illegal logging]], and illegal fishing"  and "protect the marine environment from ship pollution, including by implementing their obligations under [[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL]] (an international agreement to prevent marine pollution)".<ref name=":20" />

Morin and Baumier of the [[Canada Research Chair in International Political Economy]] (writing for the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development) argue that while the TPP contains an impressive number of environmental provisions and a wide range of environmental protection areas, very few of these standards are innovative, most of which being copied from previous US agreements, and that the TPP missed an opportunity to be an original and progressive contribution to the environmental agenda. However, the TPP is innovative in its utilization of a combination of the American and the European approaches in environmental protection. Indeed, in doing so, the TPP became much more detailed and specific than regular US agreements while being legally more enforceable than European agreements.<ref>Morin, Jean-Frederic and Guillaume Baumier, TPP environmental commitments: Combining the US legalistic and the EU sectoral approaches, ICTSD, 2016, http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/tpp_environmental_commitments.pdf</ref>

In 2013 when TPP was still being negotiated, [[Sierra Club]]'s director of responsible trade, Ilana Solomon, argued that the TPP "could directly threaten our climate and our environment [including] new rights that would be given to corporations, and new constraints on the fossil fuel industry all have a huge impact on our climate, water, and land."<ref>Ibrahim Balkhy (9 December 2013).

According to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], the TPP will spur innovation by requiring signatories to establish strong patentability standard and adopt strong copyright protections.<ref name=":18">{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/tpp/#promoting-innovation|title=The Trans-Pacific Partnership @ USTR.gov|website=The Trans-Pacific Partnership @ USTR.gov|access-date=22 July 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727215845/https://ustr.gov/tpp/#promoting-innovation|archive-date=27 July 2016}}</ref>

Walter Park, Professor of Economics at [[American University]], argues, based on the existing literature, that the pharmaceutical protections in TPP will potentially enhance unaffiliated licensing in developing countries, lead to tech transfers that contribute to local learning-by-doing, stimulate new drug launches in more countries, expand marketing and distribution networks, and encourage early-stage pharmaceutical innovations.<ref name=":14">{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/events/tpp-pharmaceutical-protections-too-strong-too-weak-or-just-right|title=The TPP and Pharmaceutical Protections: Too Strong, Too Weak, or Just Right?|date=25 May 2016|access-date=17 July 2016}}</ref>

As of December 2011, some provisions relating to the enforcement of patents and copyrights alleged to be present in the US proposal for the agreement had been criticised as being excessively restrictive, beyond those in the Korea–US trade agreement and [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] (ACTA).<ref name="pijip">{{cite web |last=Flynn |first=Sean |last2=Kaminski |first2=Margot E. |last3=Baker |first3=Brook K. |last4=Koo |first4=Jimmy H. |title=Public Interest Analysis of the US TPP Proposal for an IP Chapter |publisher=Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property |date=6 December 2011 |url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/research/21/}}</ref><ref name=efftpp />

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]<ref name=efftpp /> was highly critical of the leaked draft chapter on intellectual property covering copyright, trademarks, and patents. In the US, they believed this was likely to further entrench controversial aspects of US copyright law (such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]) and restrict the ability of Congress to engage in domestic law reform to meet the evolving intellectual property needs of American citizens and the innovative technology sector. Standardization of copyright provisions by other signatories would also require significant changes to other countries' copyright laws. These, according to EFF, include obligations for countries to expand [[copyright term]]s, restrict [[fair use]], adopt criminal sanctions for copyright infringement that is done without a commercial motivation (ex. [[file sharing]] of copyrighted digital media), place greater liability on [[Internet intermediary|internet intermediaries]], escalate protections for [[digital lock]]s and create new threats for journalists and whistleblowers.<ref name=efftpp>{{cite web|title=Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref>

Both the copyright term expansion and the non-complaint provision (i.e., competent authorities may initiate legal action without the need for a formal complaint) previously failed to pass in Japan because they were so controversial.<ref name=effjap /> In early 2015, "a group of artists, archivists, academics, and activists  ... in Japan [asked] their negotiators to oppose requirements in the TPP that would require their country, and five of the other 11 nations negotiating this secretive agreement, to expand their copyright terms to match the United States' already excessive length of copyright."<ref name=effjap>{{cite web|title=Massive Coalition of Japanese Organizations Campaigns Against TPP Copyright Provisions|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/massive-coalition-japanese-organizations-campaign-against-tpp-copyright-provisions|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref> The [[s:Trans-Pacific Partnership/Chapter 18#Article 18c: Term of Protection for Copyright and Related Rights|final agreement]] nonetheless sets a term of copyright equal to the one that obtains under U.S. law—life of the author plus 70 years.

[[Ken Akamatsu]], creator of Japanese manga series ''[[Love Hina]]'' and ''[[Mahou Sensei Negima!]]'', expressed concern the agreement could decimate the derivative [[dōjinshi]] (self-published) works prevalent in Japan. Akamatsu argued that the TPP "would destroy derivative dōjinshi.

In May 2015, Nobel Memorial prize winning economist [[Paul Krugman]] expressed concern that the TPP would tighten the patent laws and allow corporations such as big pharmaceutical companies and Hollywood to gain advantages, in terms of increasing rewards, at the cost of consumers, and that people in developing countries would not be able to access the medicines under the TPP regime.<ref name=TNYTPRK22May2015TPPA>[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/opinion/paul-krugman-trade-and-trust.html "Trade and Trust"] Paul Krugman, ''The New York Times'', 22 May 2015</ref> However, Walter Park, Professor of Economics at American University, argues that it is far from clear in economic research that this would necessarily happen: clarifying intellectual property rights on drugs, for some developing countries, has not led to greater prices and less access to drugs.<ref name=":14"/> Park also argues, based on the existing literature, that the pharmaceutical protections in TPP will potentially enhance unaffiliated licensing in developing countries, lead to tech transfers that contribute to local learning-by-doing, stimulate new drug launches in more countries, expand marketing and distribution networks, and encourage early stage pharmaceutical innovations.<ref name=":14" /> The [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] notes that the TPP "aligns with the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health", which allows developing countries to circumvent [[patent]] rights for better access to [[essential medicines]].<ref name=":18"/>

=== Investor-state arbitration ===

* Freedom from discrimination: An assurance that those doing business abroad will face a level playing field and will not be treated less favorably than local investors or competitors from other countries.

* Protection against denial of justice: An assurance that investors will not be denied justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings.
* Right to transfer capital: An assurance that investors will be able to move capital relating to their investments freely, subject to safeguards to provide government flexibility, including to respond to financial crises and ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system.

The [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] challenges the notion that ISDS challenges "the sovereign ability of governments impose any measure they wish to protect labor rights, the environment, or other issues of public welfare".<ref name=":15" /> The [[International Bar Association|International Bar Association (IBA)]] mirrors these sentiments, noting that "while investment treaties limit states’ ability to inflict arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, they do not limit (and, in fact, expressly safeguard) a state's sovereign right to regulate in the public interest in a [[Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing|fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory]] manner."<ref name=":27" /> The [[White House Office|White House]] notes that investment protections are a component of more than 3,000 trade agreements, the vast majority of which have some form of neutral arbitration.<ref name=":17">{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/26/investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-questions-and-answers|title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) Questions and Answers|date=26 February 2015|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref> The United States is party to at least 50 such agreements, has only faced 13 ISDS cases and never lost an ISDS case.<ref name=":17" /> The White House asserts that the ISDS components of the TPP are an upgrade and improvement on ISDS in other trade agreements: TPP makes it absolutely clear that governments can regulate in the public interest (including with regard to health, safety and the environment); TPP includes the ability to dismiss frivolous claims quickly and award fees against the claimant to deter such suits; sham corporations will be prevented from accessing the investment protections; and arbitration proceedings under TPP will be open to the public and allow for inputs from non-parties.<ref name=":17" />

The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] argues that "the ISDS provisions in the TPP are a significant improvement over those in previous agreements".<ref name=":23" /> PIIE notes that the ISDS mechanism in the TPP respects environmental, health, and safety regulation; ensures the transparency of dispute proceedings; and eliminates [[forum shopping]].<ref name=":23" /> PIIE asserts that some of the innovations in the ISDS provisions of TPP "are generally disliked by the US business community."<ref name=":23" /> PIIE claims that ISDS provisions are necessary, as they boost investment: "empirical evidence has shown that treaties including these provisions have a positive effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows between signatory countries."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/what-do-data-say-about-relationship-between-investor-state|title=What Do the Data Say about the Relationship between Investor-State Dispute Settlement Provisions and FDI? {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref> PIIE challenges the claim that ISDS "arbitrators lack integrity", noting that arbitrators take an oath of impartiality and both sides of a case choose arbitrators.<ref name=":23" /> PIIE agrees "that secrecy has gone too far" in many ISDS cases, but notes that "TPP negotiators heeded this criticism" and opened up ISDS cases to greater transparency.<ref name=":23" />

According to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], the TPP imposes "binding and fully enforceable obligations" on signatories to "protect the freedom to form unions and bargain collectively" and "eliminate exploitative child labor and forced labor protect against employment discrimination".<ref name=":21">{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/tpp/#protecting-workers|title=The Trans-Pacific Partnership @ USTR.gov|website=The Trans-Pacific Partnership @ USTR.gov|access-date=22 July 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727215845/https://ustr.gov/tpp/#protecting-workers|archive-date=27 July 2016}}</ref> The obligations include "laws on acceptable conditions of work related to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health."<ref name=":21" /> The USTR insists that if countries like Malaysia and Vietnam do not enforce provisions relating to forced labor, human trafficking and collective bargaining, they will cease to get the economic benefits of the TPP agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-trans-pacific-partnership/frequently-asked-questions-on-the-trans-pacific-partnership-eddc8d87ac73#.7j4pdoi5g|title=Will TPP promote higher labor standards?|last=Representative|first=U.

The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] asserts that "the TPP includes more protections of labor rights than any previous US free trade agreement."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/newsroom/short-videos/labor-standards-tpp|title=Labor Standards in the TPP {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> In January 2016, [[Human Rights Watch]] said that the TPP side agreements with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei "are a unique and significant step in efforts to protect labor rights in trade agreements" but noted that enforcement of these rules remains to be seen: "gauging compliance will require subjective assessments by the US that may take years to carry out and face obstacles arising from foreign policy objectives, commercial interests, and other political considerations."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/12/qa-trans-pacific-partnership#4|title=Q&A: The Trans-Pacific Partnership|date=12 January 2016|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref>

Dartmouth economics Professor Emily J. Blanchard argues that while the TPP has been roundly criticized on the political left, progressives should actually be supportive of the TPP: "The TPP’s promise of a new progressive rule book – one that includes enforceable agreements against child labor and workplace discrimination, measures to punish illegal logging and trade in protected species, and protections against consumer fraud – would mark a substantial step forward in the progressive policy agenda on the global stage."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/why-progressives-should-rescue-the-tpp-trade-deal-60304|title=Why progressives should rescue the TPP trade deal|last=Blanchard|first=Emily J.|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref>

=== Regulatory cooperation ===
Even though the TPP had not been passed, the agreement had already introduced forms of regulatory cooperation for agriculture beyond that found in the WTO.<ref name=":31">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/30/the-sky-fell-on-the-u-s-poultry-industry-last-year-but-nafta-and-the-tpp-helped-protect-u-s-exports/|title=The sky fell on the U.S. poultry industry last year.

== Economic impact ==
The [[United States International Trade Commission|U.S. International Trade Commission]], the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]], the [[World Bank]] and the Office of the Chief Economist at Global Affairs Canada found that the final agreement would, if ratified, lead to net positive economic outcomes for all signatories, while a [[Heterodox economics|heterodox]] analysis by two [[Tufts University]] economists found that the agreement would adversely affect the signatories.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2"/><ref name=":12" /><ref name="TUJC16Jan20162" />

Economists Peter A. Petri and Michael G. Plummer challenge the view that TPP will primarily benefit the wealthy. Their analysis finds that "the gains from TPP appear to be fairly distributed—labour will gain relative to capital, and cost reductions will favour low-income households. Some workers will need to change jobs, but they constitute a small fraction of normal job churn in any given year, and the national benefits argue for generous compensation for their adjustment costs. The agreement will also benefit workers in TPP's poorest member countries."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/economics-tpp-winners-and-losers|title=Economics of the Trans-Pacific Partnership: Distributional impact|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> Research by Harvard economist Robert Z.

===Macroeconomics===
==== World Bank report ====
[[World Bank]] found that if ratified by signatories, the TPP "agreement could raise GDP in member countries by an average of 1.1 percent by 2030. It could also increase member countries' trade by 11 percent by 2030, and represent a boost to regional trade growth, which had slowed to about 5 percent, on average, during 2010-14 from about 10 percent during 1990-07."<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/GEP/GEP2016a/Global-Economic-Prospects-January-2016-Implications-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Agreement.pdf|title=Potential Macroeconomic Implications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership|publisher=World Bank}}</ref> The World Bank finds that the agreement will raise real wages in all signatories: "In the United States, for example, changes in real wages are expected to be small as unskilled and skilled wages increase by 0.4 and 0.6 percent, respectively, by 2030. In contrast, in Vietnam, TPP could increase the real wages of unskilled workers by more than 14 percent by 2030, as production intensive in unskilled labor (e.g. textiles) shifts to Vietnam."<ref name=":1" />

==== U.S. International Trade Commission estimate ====
The [[United States International Trade Commission|U.S. International Trade Commission]] estimates that "TPP would have positive effects, albeit small as a percentage of the overall size of the U.S. economy".<ref name=":2"/> There will be 128,000 more full-time jobs.<ref name=":25" /> By 2032, U.S. annual real income would increase by 0.23%, real GDP would be $42.7 billion or 0.15% higher, employment would be 0.07% higher, US exports would increase 1%, and imports would increase 1.1%.<ref name=":2"/> The report added, "TPP would generally establish trade-related disciplines that strengthen and harmonize regulations, increase certainty, and decrease trade costs for firms that trade and invest in the TPP region."<ref name=":2"/> Vietnam is often seen as the biggest beneficiary of TPP.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-08/more-shoes-and-shrimp-less-china-reliance-for-vietnam-in-tpp|title=The Biggest Winner From TPP Trade Deal May Be Vietnam|last=svwriter|first=John Boudreau|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/03/why-vietnam-loves-the-trans-pacific-partnership/|title=Why Vietnam Loves the Trans-Pacific Partnership|last=Diplomat|first=Dien Luong, The|website=The Diplomat|access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Michael J.|last2=Goodman|first2=Matthew P.|date=2 October 2015|title=After TPP: the Geopolitics of Asia and the Pacific|journal=The Washington Quarterly|volume=38|issue=4|pages=19–34|doi=10.1080/0163660X.2015.1125827|issn=0163-660X}}</ref> The U.S. International Trade Commission identifies the following US industries as net beneficiaries of TPP: Passenger cars; Apparel, Dairy production; Retailers and Wholesalers; and Business services; and as net losers: Auto parts; Textiles; Soybean production; Transportation and tourism; and Chemicals and drugs.<ref name=":2"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/05/19/ten-winning-and-losing-industries-from-the-pacific-trade-deal/|title=Ten Winning and Losing Industries from the Pacific Trade Deal|last=Mauldin|first=William|website=WSJ|access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref>

==== Office of the Chief Economist at Global Affairs Canada report ====
According to a report by the Office of the Chief Economist at Global Affairs Canada, ratification of TPP would increase Canada's GDP by $4.3 billion by 2040.<ref name=":32"/><ref name=":33">{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/not-joining-tpp-will-cost-canada-billions-in-economic-growth-report/article31809986/|title=Not joining TPP will cost Canada billions in economic growth: report|access-date=10 September 2016}}</ref> This is primarily due to the preferential access it would receive to markets in the Asia-Pacific rim.<ref name=":32"/><ref name=":33" />  According to the report, ratification by the other TPP signatories but a failure by Canada to ratify the agreement would lead Canada to face estimated GDP losses of $5.3 billion by 2040.<ref name=":32"/><ref name=":33" />

==== Peterson Institute for International Economics report ====
Economists Peter A. Petri and Michael G. Plummer of the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] project that the TPP would increase incomes in the U.S. by $131 billion annually, or 0.5 percent of GDP.  Exports from the U.S. would increase by $357 billion annually, or 9.1 percent, as a result of the agreement.<ref name=":12">{{cite news|last1=Hufbauer|first1=Gary Clyde|title=Column: Why the Trans-Pacific Partnership isn't a bum deal|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/column-why-the-trans-pacific-partnership-isnt-a-bum-deal/|publisher=PBS|date=5 February 2016|accessdate=7 February 2016}}</ref>  However, two [[Tufts University]] economists argue that the research by Petri relies on unrealistic assumptions such as full employment: lost jobs will be immediately replaced in other industrial sectors.<ref name="TUJC16Jan20162" /> According to Harvard economist [[Dani Rodrik]], "Petri and Plummer assume that labor markets are sufficiently flexible that job losses in adversely affected parts of the economy are necessarily offset by job gains elsewhere. Unemployment is ruled out from the start – a built-in outcome of the model that TPP proponents often fudge."<ref name=":3"/> Rodrik notes that "the Petri-Plummer model is squarely rooted in decades of academic trade modeling, which makes a sharp distinction between microeconomic effects (shaping resource allocation across sectors) and macroeconomic effects (related to overall levels of demand and employment). In this tradition, trade liberalization is a microeconomic "shock" that affects the composition of employment, but not its overall level."<ref name=":3"/>

==== Tufts University report ====
[[Tufts University]] researchers project the TPP would have a negative impact on employment: 450,000 US jobs, 75,000 Japanese jobs, 58,000 Canadian jobs and 5,000 New Zealand jobs would be lost by 2025.<ref name="TUJC16Jan20162" /> According to the report, 771,000 jobs would be lost in total and positive economic effects would be negligible for participating countries.<ref name="TUJC16Jan20162" /><ref name=nytimes01Feb2016JC>[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/business/international/economists-sharply-split-over-trade-deal-effects.html Economists Sharply Split Over Trade Deal Effects] J. Calmes, The New York Times, 1 February 2016</ref>

Harvard economist [[Robert Z. Lawrence]] says that the model used by the Tufts researchers "is simply not suited for credibly predicting the effects of the TPP" and argues that the model used by Petri and Plummer is superior.<ref name=":0"/> Lawrence argues that the model used by the Tufts researchers "does not have the granularity that allows it to estimate variables such as exports, imports, foreign direct investment, and changes in industrial structure. As a result, its predictions ignore the benefits to the TPP economies that occur through increased specialization, the realization of scale economies, and improved consumer choice."<ref name=":0"/> Lawrence also notes that the model used by the Tufts researchers finds that the TPP will cause GDP to fall by 5.24% in non-TPP developing countries, such as China, India, and Indonesia, which Lawrence is highly skeptical of: "It is not believable that a trade agreement of this magnitude could cause the rest of the world to plummet into recession."<ref name=":0"/> Harvard economist [[Dani Rodrik]], a well-known skeptic of globalization, says that the Tufts researchers do "a poor job of explaining how their model works, and the particulars of their simulation are somewhat murky... the Capaldo framework lacks sectoral and country detail; its behavioral assumptions remain opaque; and its extreme Keynesian assumptions sit uneasily with its medium-term perspective."<ref name=":3"/>

[[Fredrik Erixon]] and Matthias Bauer of the [[ECIPE|European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE)]] write that the Tufts analysis has such serious flaws "that its results should neither be regarded reliable nor realistic."<ref name=":30"/> They write that Tufts model is "by and large a demand-driven model that does not make efforts to capture the supply-side effects of trade, which are the effects that are proven to be the core positive effects of trade liberalisation. Equally problematic, the model is not designed to assess the effect on trade from trade agreements – in fact, the model is profoundly ill suited for such an exercise. No trade economist, regardless what school of thought he or she comes from, has ever used this model to make estimates of trade. The reason is simple: if a model cannot predict the effects on the flows and profile of trade as a consequence of trade liberalisation, it is of no use at all."<ref name=":30"/> They add, "In Capaldo’s analysis, structural change and the emergence of new industries do not play a role at all. Capaldo implicitly assumes that an economy with its labour and capital does not respond and adjust to new circumstances. New competition only leads to new unemployment. In addition, the impact of lower barriers on international commerce on product and process innovation is neglected. Finally, Capaldo does not account for the impact of competition on the cost of production and final consumer prices."<ref name=":30"/>

According to the Congressional Research Service, "The Tufts study has drawn particular criticism as an unconventional framework for analyzing trade agreements, whereas Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, such as that used in the Peterson study are standard in trade policy analysis."<ref name=":8"/> Fabio Ghironi, Professor in Economics at the [[University of Washington]], describes the models used by the World Bank and the Peterson Institute in more favorable terms than the Tufts analysis.<ref name="auto1"/>

=== Effects on the European Union ===
The EU is trying to form trade agreements with each country that is part of the TPP: since 2013, there have been talks of a free trade agreement between the EU and Japan, and in 2015 the EU presented its new strategy to improve trade in the Asia-Pacific entitled "Trade for All."<ref name="European Parliamentary Research Service">{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/582028/EPRS_BRI(2016)582028_EN.pdf|title=The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Potential regional and global impacts|author= Krisztina Binder|date=May 2016}}</ref>

=== Liberalization ===
According to an analysis by the Cato Institute of the chapters of the TPP, 15 chapters have a liberalizing impact, 5 have a protectionist impact, and 2 have a neutral impact.<ref name=":34">{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/working-paper/should-free-traders-support-trans-pacific-partnership-assessment-americas|title=Should Free Traders Support the Trans- Pacific Partnership?

There have been conflicting arguments on whether or not the TPP aims to increase the liberalization of trade. For arguments that propose that the TPP succeeds at liberalizing trade among the participating nations, there is a question of whether or not this causes a positive or a negative net change. Some scholars argue that participatory members of the TPP believe that such membership is a utilitarian and practical method toward new trade liberalization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Meredith|year=2011|title=The Trans-Pacific Partnership: New Paradigm or Wolf in Sheep's Clothing?|ssrn=1908411|journal=Boston College International & Comparative Law Review|volume=34}}</ref> Scholars Peter Petri and Michael Plummer describe the TPP as a "dynamic process - and example of competitive liberalization," and this liberalization described can result in a new type of governance for the Asia-Pacific, as well as transnational trade.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petri|first=Peter|last2=Plummer|first2=Michael|year=2012|title=The Trans-Pacific Partnership and Asia-Pacific Integration: Policy Implications|journal=Peterson Institute for International Economics Policy Brief}}</ref>

=== China ===
According to a 2020 study, the TPP pushed [[China]] to introduce its own internal liberal market reforms. Reform-minded elites in China used the TPP to justify reform.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Alex Yu-Ting|last2=Katada|first2=Saori N.|date=2020-08-07|title=Striving for greatness: status aspirations, rhetorical entrapment, and domestic reforms|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2020.1801486|journal=Review of International Political Economy|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–38|doi=10.1080/09692290.2020.1801486|issn=0969-2290}}</ref>

== Geopolitics ==
TPP increases the likelihood that Japan will undertake economic reforms to revive its economy, which coupled with potential South-Korean accession to the TPP, might have an economic impact on China. By making the Chinese economy less competitive and Chinese leadership less likely to write the rules of trade in East and Southeast Asia, the Chinese government will be under great internal and external pressure to liberalize its economy.<ref name=":6"/> Japan's prime minister, [[Shinzō Abe|Shinzo Abe]], believes that future Chinese accession to TPP would have a major pacifying impact on the Asia-Pacific region.<ref name=":7"/> U.S. Trade Representative [[Michael Froman]] has said that a failure to ratify TPP would give China the opportunity to boost its exports and set labor and environmental standards in the fast-growing Asia Pacific region through the [[Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership]] (RCEP).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-idUSKCN1090QZ |title=Killing TPP would hand China 'keys to the castle': U.S. trade representative |date=29 July 2016 |newspaper=Reuters |access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>

South Korea did not participate in TPP "largely out of a concern to maintain balance in its economic relations with China and the United States" but has shown greater interest in joining TPP after Japan, its biggest economic competitor, decided to participate.<ref name=":9" /> Also, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Taiwan have reportedly been considering and implementing various domestic reforms to improve their prospects for eventually joining.<ref name=":29" />

Since formal TPP negotiations began in 2010, China's attitude towards TPP has:

<blockquote>swung from disdain to suspicion to cautious embrace... Conclusion of a TPP agreement in early October has sparked a lively debate in Beijing, with the weight of elite opinion seeming to tilt toward eventual membership; for example, the head of the Chinese-sponsored Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Jin Liqun, announced his support during a speech in Washington shortly after the TPP deal was announced.<ref name=":9" /></blockquote>

The TPP may give renewed impetus to trade negotiations among China, Japan, and Korea, and increase the likelihood of [[Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership]] (RCEP) which could provide a possible pathway to a [[free trade area]] of the Asia-Pacific.<ref name=":9" />

In January 2016, the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] announced its support for TPP, saying "without such an agreement, the United States would be ceding economic leadership to other global powers, letting them set the rules of economic engagement in the region".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/finance/264631-manufacturers-endorse-tpp |title=Big Endorsement for Obama Trade Deal |newspaper=The Hill |last1=Needham |first1=Vicki |accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref>

A 2016 study by [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] political scientists Todd Allee and Andrew Lugg suggests that if the TPP becomes standard legal text, it will shape future trade cooperation and agreements.<ref name=":24" />

An October 2016 survey of [[international relations]] scholars showed that the overwhelming majority supported the TPP.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trip.wm.edu/charts/#/bargraph/42/6771 |title=TRIP Data Viewer |website=trip.wm.edu |access-date=26 October 2016}}</ref>

=== United States considerations ===
The original TPP was thought by some to likely bring China's neighbours closer to the United States and reduce their dependence on Chinese trade.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":9" /><ref name=":6">{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/07/china-tpp-trans-pacific-partnership-obama-us-trade-xi/ |title=What Will the TPP Mean for China? |website=Foreign Policy |access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/world/asia/trans-pacific-partnership-china-australia.html |title=U.S. Allies See Trans-Pacific Partnership as a Check on China |last=Perlez |first=Jane |date=6 October 2015|newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/publication/26627/trade_is_a_national_security_imperative.html |title=Trade Is a National Security Imperative - Harvard - Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs |website=belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu |access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/foreign-policy/asia/geopolitical-necessity-trade/ |title=The Geopolitical Necessity of Trade |last=Boot |first=Max }}</ref><ref name=":26">{{Cite news |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-death-tpp-the-best-thing-ever-happened-china-19232?page=show |title=The Death of TPP: The Best Thing That Ever Happened to China |last=Magnusson |first=Earl Anthony Wayne, Oliver |newspaper=The National Interest |language=en |access-date=31 January 2017}}</ref><ref name="foreignpolicy.com">{{Cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/03/this-isnt-realpolitik-this-is-amateur-hour/|title=This Isn't Realpolitik.

US Secretary of Defense [[Ash Carter]] claimed the passage of the TPP to be as valuable to the United States as the creation of another aircraft carrier.<ref name=":9" /> President Obama has argued "if we don't pass this agreement—if America doesn't write those rules—then countries like China will".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/business/international/trans-pacific-trade-deal-tpp-vietnam-labor-rights.html |title=Trans-Pacific Partnership Text Released, Waving Green Flag for Debate |last=Calmes |first=Jackie |date=5 November 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref> According to the Congressional Research Service, "many Asian policymakers—correctly or not—could interpret a failure of TPP in the United States as a symbol of declining U.S. interest in the region and inability to assert leadership... failure to conclude TPP could, in effect, allow China to shape regional rules of commerce and diplomacy through its own trade and investment initiatives, potentially creating regional rules and norms less beneficial for U.S. interests."<ref name=":8"/> [[Michael Green (political expert)|Michael J. Green]] and Matthew P. Goodman argue that "history will be unforgiving if TPP fails... If Congress rejects TPP, trying to negotiate a similar arrangement in Asia would reopen demands on the United States—and in the meantime, would likely give impetus to alternative arrangements like RCEP that exclude the United States. Momentum behind the U.S.-led international order would shift to momentum against it. Future generations of historians will take note of U.S. leadership at this moment."<ref name=":9" /> Dan Ikenson, director of Cato's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, argued in July 2016 that the "failure of Congress to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year would do more to subvert U.S. regional and global interests than anything China is capable of doing."<ref name=":29">{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/the-trans-pacific-partnership-is-essential-to-regional-peace |title=The Trans-Pacific Partnership Is Essential to Regional Peace and Global Prosperity |date=14 July 2016 |access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> [[Stephen Walt|Stephen M. Walt]], professor of international relations at Harvard University, writing after the Trump Administration abandoned the TPP, described the TPP as "a key institution that would have bound a number of Asian countries more tightly to the United States".<ref name="foreignpolicy.com"/>

=== Non-TPP party opinions ===
On 30 January 2015 [[Philip Hammond]], the former [[Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom]], described the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership as "potentially important liberalising steps forward".<ref>Hammond, P., [https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-speech-on-the-uk-in-asia-pacific "Foreign Secretary's speech on the UK in Asia Pacific"] Foreign & Commonwealth Office, UK, 30 January 2015, accessed 8 October 2015</ref>

The [[European Centre for International Political Economy]] (ECIPE), a think tank on European policies, predicted in 2012 that the TPP would be a "deadly threat to European exporters of agricultural products in TPP countries".<ref>Messerlin, Patrick, [http://www.ecipe.org/media/publication_pdfs/Messerlin_TPP-EU_EN05212.pdf The TPP and the EU policy in East Asia], ECIPE Policy Brief, no.11/2012, European Centre for International Political Economy, {{ISSN|1653-8994}}.</ref>

ECIPE has said in 2014 that TPP "will be the first 'competing' [[economic integration]] that is large enough to have a considerable negative impact on Europe. In the long-term, the negative effects will come from dynamic impact, e.g. on investment, productivity and competitiveness".<ref name=ecipe14>Matthias Bauer, Fredrik Erixon, Martina Ferracane and Hosuk Lee-Makiyama [http://www.ecipe.org/app/uploads/2014/12/PB09_1.pdf TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP: A challenge to Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315115352/http://www.ecipe.org/app/uploads/2014/12/PB09_1.pdf |date=15 March 2016 }} ECIPE Policy Briefs, No.9/2014, page 1-13, European Centre for International Political Economy, {{ISSN|1653-8994}}</ref>
[[Pascal Lamy]] called the TPP "the last of big old-style trade agreements".<ref name=ecipe14/>{{rp|2}}

Russian Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was reportedly critical of the TPP, saying that "the WTO is being encroached upon" and this might lead to the "destruction of world trade".{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

== Criticism{{anchor|Protests}} ==
:{{globalize|date=September 2020}}
Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist [[Paul Krugman]] has said that "there isn't a compelling case for this deal, from either a global or a national point of view."<ref name="NYT-20140227">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/opinion/krugman-no-big-deal.html|title=No Big Deal|last=Krugman|first=Paul|date=27 February 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|author-link=Paul Krugman|accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref>

In February 2016, [[United Nations]]' human rights expert [[Alfred de Zayas]] argued that the TPP was fundamentally flawed and was based on an outdated model of trade pacts, and that governments should not sign or ratify the TPP.<ref>[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17006 UN expert urges Pacific Rim countries not to sign the TPP without committing to human rights and development] OHCHR, 2 February 2016</ref> According to de Zayas, the international human rights regime imposes binding legal obligations on countries, including the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], and trade must be done under the human rights regime. Under the ISDS in the TPP, investors can sue a government, while a government cannot sue investors. De Zayas argued that this asymmetry made the system unfair. He added that international law, including accountability and transparency, must prevail over trade pacts.

=== Currency manipulation ===
Some critics and even supporters of the TPP wanted the deal to contain measures that would crack down on nations who engage in alleged [[currency manipulation]], notably China.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/chinas-impact-looms-large-u-s-debates-trade-deals/|title=China's impact looms large as U.S. debates its own trade deals|language=en-US|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref> However, [[Daniel W. Drezner|Daniel Drezner]], professor of international politics at Tufts University, has argued that the trade deal was never likely to include restrictions on currency manipulation, as it would have restricted U.S. monetary policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/08/is-hillary-clinton-right-about-the-trans-pacific-partnership/|title=Is Hillary Clinton right about the Trans-Pacific Partnership?|website=Washington Post|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref> Harvard economist [[Jeffrey Frankel]] has argued that the inclusion of currency manipulation language in TPP would be a mistake.<ref name=":22">{{cite web|url=http://econbrowser.com/archives/2015/06/the-top-ten-reasons-why-trade-agreements-should-not-cover-currency-manipulation|title="The Top Ten Reasons Why Trade Agreements Should Not Cover Currency Manipulation" {{!}} Econbrowser|website=econbrowser.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref> Frankel noted that currency manipulation would be hard to enforce (in part because it is impossible to tell whether a currency is overvalued or undervalued); "currency manipulation" can often be legitimate; China, often alleged to be a major currency manipulator, is not party to the TPP; currency manipulation accusations are often meritless; and because it would restrict U.S. monetary policy.<ref name=":22" />

=== Length and complexity ===
[[Donald Trump]] has criticized the TPP agreement for being too long and complicated, saying "[i]t's 5,600 pages long, so complex that nobody's read it."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-is-upset-1447374770 |title=Donald Trump Is Upset |date=13 November 2015 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |issn=0099-9660 |access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref> Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] has charged that the "TPP is much more than a 'free trade' agreement."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-trade/ |title=Bernie Sanders on Trade |last=FeelTheBern.org |language=en-US |access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref>

However, [[Georgetown University]] Professor Marc L. Busch and [[McGill University]] Professor Krzysztof J. Pelc note that modern trade deals are long and complex because they often tackle [[non-tariff barriers to trade]], such as different standards and regulations, in addition to [[tariff]]s. Due to steadily decreasing tariff barriers since WWII, countries have become increasingly likely to enact trade barriers in the form of non-tariff barriers. National firms often lobby their own governments to enact regulations that are designed to keep out foreign firms. The TPP addresses many of these "disguised restrictions on trade" by, for instance, "basing these measures on agreed-upon science; making the process of formulating regulations more transparent; and giving foreign exporters opportunities to offer substantive input in the formulation of these measures."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/02/yes-the-tpp-agreement-is-over-5000-pages-long-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing/|title=Yes, the TPP agreement is over 5,000 pages long. Here's why that's a good thing.|website=Washington Post|access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref>

=== Secrecy of negotiations ===
As with many trade agreements{{cn|date=September 2020}}, until being finalized, negotiations for the TPP were conducted with significant secrecy. Drafts of the agreement were kept classified during negotiations, and access to the working text was significantly restricted even for government officials and business representatives involved in the talks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/secrecy-eroding-support-for-trade-pact-critics-say-117581|title=Extreme secrecy eroding support for Obama's trade pact|publisher=Politico|author=Edward-Isaac Dovere|author-link=Edward-Isaac Dovere|date=4 May 2015|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> Despite this, some sections of TPP drafts were leaked to the public by [[WikiLeaks]], which published an intellectual property chapter draft in 2013,<ref>{{cite web |title=Secret Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) |url=https://wikileaks.org/tpp/ |accessdate=13 November 2013 |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]] |date=13 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/13/wikileaks-trans-pacific-partnership-chapter-secret |title=WikiLeaks publishes secret draft chapter of Trans-Pacific Partnership |first=Steven |last=Musil |work=The Guardian (UK) |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref> an environmental chapter draft in 2014,<ref>{{cite press release |title=Secret Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) – Environment Chapter |url=https://wikileaks.org/tpp-enviro/pressrelease.html |accessdate=11 January 2014 |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]] |date=14 January 2014}}</ref> and the final intellectual property chapter in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release – Updated Secret Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) – IP Chapter (second publication) |url=https://www.wikileaks.org/tpp-ip2/pressrelease/ |date= 26 October 2014 |work=[[WikiLeaks]] }}</ref>

In 2012, critics such as Public Citizen's [[Global Trade Watch]], a consumer advocacy group, called for more open negotiations in regard to the agreement. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk responded that he believes the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) conducted "the most engaged and transparent process as we possibly could", but that "some measure of discretion and confidentiality" are needed "to preserve negotiating strength and to encourage our partners to be willing to put issues on the table they may not otherwise."<ref name="reuters_1">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/14/us-usa-trade-kirk-idUSBRE84C0AQ20120514?feedType=RSS&feedName=everything&virtualBrandChannel=11563|title=Some secrecy needed in trade talks: Ron Kirk|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=13 May 2012|last=Palmer|first=Doug}}</ref> He dismissed the "tension" as natural and noted that when the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] drafts were released, negotiators were subsequently unable to reach a final agreement.<ref name="reuters_1" />

On 23 May 2012, U.S. Senator [[Ron Wyden]], Democrat of Oregon, introduced {{USBill|112|s|3225}}, which would have required the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to disclose its TPP documents to all members of Congress.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3225| title=S. 3225 (112th)| accessdate=30 May 2012| author=112th Congress (2012)| date=23 May 2012| work=Legislation| publisher=GovTrack.us| quote=A bill to require the United States Trade Representative to provide documents relating to trade negotiations to Members of Congress and their staff upon request, and for other purposes.}}</ref> Had it passed, Wyden said that the bill would increase Congressional access to information about USTR activity.<ref name="Wyden20120523">{{USCongRec|2012|S3517|date=23 May 2012}}</ref>

[[Michael R. Wessel]], former commissioner on the U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission claimed in May 2015 that "cleared advisors" like himself were "prohibited from sharing publicly the criticisms we’ve lodged about specific proposals and approaches". He claimed that only portions of the text had been provided, "to be read under the watchful eye of a USTR official", that access on secure government-run website did not contain the most-up-to-date information, and that for cleared advisors to get that information, he had "to travel to certain government facilities and sign in to read the materials" and "even then, the administration determines what we can and cannot review and, often, they provide carefully edited summaries rather than the actual underlying text, which is critical to really understanding the consequences of the agreement."<ref>Michael Wessel [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/05/tpp-elizabeth-warren-labor-118068#ixzz3o1rz9me4 I've Read Obama's Trade Deal. Elizabeth Warren is Right to be Concerned.] Politico.com 19 May 2015, accessed 8 October 2015</ref>

In June 2015, U.S. Senator [[Rand Paul]], Republican of Kentucky, opposed the bill to [[Fast track (trade)|fast-track]] the congressional ratification of the TPP on the basis of the trade agreement's secrecy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rand Paul demands White House release trade deal text immediately|last=Shabad|first=Rebecca|date=6 June 2015|work=The Hill|URL=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/244220-rand-paul-demands-white-house-release-trade-deal-text-immediately}}</ref>

=== Industry influence ===
U.S. Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]], Democrat of Massachusetts, has alleged that corporations and industry exert disproportionate influence on U.S. trade negotiators.<ref name=":13">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/07/18/warrens-claim-that-advisory-committees-formed-during-drafting-of-trans-pacific-partnership/|title=Warren's claim that advisory committees 'formed' during drafting of Trans-Pacific Partnership|website=Washington Post|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> She asserted in July 2016 that 85% of seats on U.S. trade advisory committees were held by "senior corporation executives or industry lobbyists", and that the members of the committees "whisper in the ear" of negotiators.<ref name=":13" />

Michelle Ye Hee Lee, a fact-checker for ''The Washington Post'', wrote that Warren used "misleading language" in describing the TPP. While Warren implied that "28 trade advisory committees were formed" specifically to influence the TPP, the advisory committees were actually created as part of the [[Trade Act of 1974]]; only the membership of the trade committees had changed during the Obama administration and the early phases of the TPP. Regarding Warren's claim that trade advisers secretly "whisper in the ear of our trade negotiators", Lee wrote: "while the direct meetings take place in private, committees still have to submit written reports to Congress and provide written recommendations and advice that are made public."<ref name=":13" /> Furthermore, Lee wrote, "it is true that industry representatives make up a large number of the total membership, but it is worth noting that there is a labor committee in the second tier, labor representatives in the first tier and that the industry groups have a narrow focus (to give technical advice)."<ref name=":13" />

In response to criticisms about transparency and the large representation from industry representatives, USTR announced it would create a Public Interest Trade Advisory Committee.<ref name=":13" />

=== Non-compete clause ===
[[Dean Baker]] argued that Article 18.78, under which countries should ensure that they protect [[trade secrets]] and impose criminal procedures for violators, could be used to enforce [[non-compete agreement]]s.<ref name=":16" /> Baker points out that [[California]]'s success can partly be attributed to the fact that the state did not allow for the enforcement of non-compete agreements, making it easy for tech workers to quit their jobs and start to work for another company.<ref name=":16">[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-baker/will-the-trans-pacific-pa_b_9878794.html Will the Trans-Pacific Partnership Turn Silicon Valley Into Detroit?] D. Baker, The Huffington Post, 9 May 2016</ref>

=== Criticisms from politicians and activists ===
In 2014, linguist and political activist [[Noam Chomsky]] warned that the TPP is "designed to carry forward the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] project to maximize profit and domination, and to set the working people in the world in competition with one another so as to lower wages to increase insecurity."<ref>Zach Carter and Ryan Grim (13 January 2014).
