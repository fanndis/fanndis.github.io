== History ==

=== Formation and early years ===
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm [[Arthur Andersen]]<ref name=WBBM11>{{cite news |title=Accenture To Add 500 Jobs in Chicago |url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2011/10/11/accenture-to-add-500-jobs-in-chicago/ |newspaper=[[WBBM-TV]] |date=11 October 2011 |access-date=10 December 2015}}</ref> in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for [[General Electric]] to install a computer at [[Appliance Park]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]],<ref name=Brachear05>{{cite news |title=Joseph Glickauf Jr. 1912-2005 |last1=Brachear |first1=Manya A. |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-07-28/news/0507280218_1_arthur-andersen-electronic-computer-ham-radio-operator |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=28 July 2005 |access-date=10 December 2015}}</ref> which led to GE's installation of a [[UNIVAC I]] computer and printer,<ref name=Betts01>{{cite news |title=GE's Appliance Park Still an IT Innovator |last1=Betts |first1=Mitch |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2590401/computer-hardware/ge-s-appliance-park-still-an-it-innovator.html |magazine=[[Computerworld]] |date=29 January 2001 |access-date=10 December 2015}}</ref> believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.<ref name=Betts90>{{cite news |title=The Univac I: First in the field |last1=Betts |first1=Mitch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7vRlroiLwsC&q=the+univac+I%3A+first+in+the+field&pg=PT26 |magazine=[[Computerworld]] |date=2 July 1990 |access-date=10 December 2015}}</ref> [[Joseph Glickauf]], an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.<ref name=Brachear05/>

===Split from Arthur Andersen===
In 1989, [[Arthur Andersen]] and Andersen Consulting became separate units of [[Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative]] (AWSC). Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and [[Arthur Andersen]]. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into [[escrow]] and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2&nbsp;billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.<ref>{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Mitchell |date=8 August 2000 |title=Arbitrator's Ruling Goes Against Accounting Arm : Consultants Win Battle Of Andersen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/08/business/worldbusiness/08iht-consult.2.t.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |access-date=1 March 2014}}</ref>

=== Emergence of Accenture ===
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Andersen felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.<ref>[https://www.informationweek.com/andersen-consulting-changing-name-to-accenture-/d/d-id/1009400 Andersen Consulting Changing Name To Accenture – 26 Oct. 2000]; InformationWeek</ref>

[[File:AccentureNYSE.jpg|thumb|right|Accenture's banner hanging on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] ([[NYSE]]) building for its initial public offering on 19 July 2001.]]
On 19 July 2001, Accenture's initial public offering ([[initial public offering|IPO]]) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE); [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7&nbsp;billion.<ref>[https://money.cnn.com/2001/07/19/deals/accenture/index.htm Accenture IPO gains in first trades – 19 Jul. 2001]; CNN Money</ref>

===2000s: Bermuda headquarters===
In October 2002, the Congressional [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven.<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03194r.pdf Information on Federal Contractors That Are Incorporated Offshore]; United States General Accounting Office; 1 October 2002</ref> The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former [[CNN]] journalist [[Lou Dobbs]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Dobbs|first=Lou|title=Exporting America|url=https://money.cnn.com/2004/03/09/commentary/dobbs/dobbs/index.htm|access-date=3 May 2011|publisher=CNN|date=9 March 2004}}</ref> have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US [[tax avoidance]] ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.<ref>[http://www.house.gov/delauro/press/2004/accenture_06_01_04.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503215542/http://www.house.gov/delauro/press/2004/accenture_06_01_04.html|date=3 May 2007}}</ref> The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."<ref name="GAO">{{cite web|title=Information on Federal Contractors That Are Incorporated Offshore|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/100/91572.html|website=gao.gov|publisher=General Accounting Office|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>

Accenture engaged in an [[NHS Connecting for Health|IT overhaul project]] for the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.<ref name=nhswithdraw>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/sep/28/news.business|title=Accenture to quit NHS technology overhaul|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=18 July 2014|date=28 September 2006|last1=Bowers|first1=Simon}}</ref> The government of the [[United Kingdom]] ultimately abandoned the project five years later for the same reasons.<ref name=nhscancel>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-pulls-the-plug-on-its-11bn-it-system-2330906.html|title=NHS pulls the plug on its £11bn IT system|publisher=The Independent|access-date=18 July 2014}}</ref>

In June 2018, Accenture generated controversy over the amount the firm has been charging to recruit 7,500 [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]] officers.
