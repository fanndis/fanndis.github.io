'''The Official Secrets Act 1989''' (c. 6) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that repeals and replaces section 2 of the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]], thereby removing the [[public interest defence]] created by that section.

[[Lord Bingham]] said that the white paper "Reform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911" (Cm. 408) (June 1988) was the immediate precursor of this Act and that its recommendations bear directly on the interpretation of this Act.<ref>R v. Shayler [2002] UKHL 11 at [11], [2002] All ER 477 at 485</ref>

==General information==
===Capacity===
The offences under sections 1(3), 2(1), 3(1) and 4(1) can be committed only by persons who are or have been, and the offence under section 8(1) can be committed only by persons who are, Crown servants or government contractors.

The offences under the Act, that can be committed only by persons who, as the case may be, are or have been Crown servants, government contractors, or members of the security and intelligence services, can be committed only where the information, document or other article in question is or has been in the possession of the person in question by virtue of their position as such.<ref>Sections 1(1), 1(3), 2(1), 3(1), 4(1) and 8(1).</ref>

The offences under sections 5(2), 5(6), 6(2), 8(4), 8(5) and 8(6) can be committed by any person.

===Requirement that the disclosure be "damaging"===
Sections 1(3), 2(1), 3(1), 5(3)(a) and 6(2) provide that the disclosures to which they apply are not an offence unless they are "damaging". Section 4(2) is similar.

===Extra-territorial jurisdiction===
Offences under any provision of the Act, other than sections 8(1) or 8(4) or 8(5), committed by any person in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Channel Islands]], or in any colony, or committed by British citizens or Crown servants in any place, are cognisable as offences under the law of the United Kingdom.<ref>Section 15</ref>

===Arrest and mode of trial===
In [[England and Wales]], offences under any provision of this Act other than sections 8(1) or 8(4) or 8(5) were formerly classified as [[arrestable offence]]s, initially by virtue of sections 24(1)(c) and (2)(bb)<ref>Section 24(2)(bb) of the Act of 1984 was inserted by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/6/section/11/enacted section 11(1)] of this Act.</ref> of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], and then by virtue of sections 24(1)(c) and (2)<ref>Sections 24(1)(c) and (2) of the Act of 1984 were amended by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/section/48/enacted section 48] of the [[Police Reform Act 2002]].</ref> of, and paragraph 18 of Schedule 1A<ref>Schedule 1A of the Act of 1984 was inserted by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/schedule/6/enacted Schedule 6] of the [[Police Reform Act 2002]].</ref> to, that Act.

The offences under sections 8(1), (4) and (5) are triable only [[Summary offence|summarily]]; the others are triable [[Hybrid offence#England and Wales|either way]].

===Prescribed bodies and persons===
Sections 7(5), 8(9), 12 and 13(1) confer powers on the Secretary of State to "prescribe" bodies and persons for certain purposes. These powers have been exercised by the following instruments:
* [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1990/200/contents/made The Official Secrets Act 1989 (Prescription) Order 1990] (S.I. 1990/200)
* [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1993/847/contents/made The Official Secrets Act 1989 (Prescription) (Amendment) Order 1993] (S.I. 1993/847)

===Proposed revisions===
The [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] (ISC) annual report for 2005–2006 on UK intelligence services states:

{{quote|Official Secrets Act
113. The Home Office has bid for a legislative slot in the next session to amend the Official Secrets Act 1989. (At the time of publication it was still awaiting confirmation of its place in the timetable.) The Home Office has informed the Committee that, in its view, the proposed Bill should remove the common law defence of [[Duress in English law#Duress by circumstances|duress of circumstance]] in order to address unauthorised disclosure by members, or former members, of the intelligence and security Agencies. The Bill should also put an element of the associated "authorisation to disclose" procedure onto a statutory footing and increase penalties. This proposal has yet to receive policy clearance across Whitehall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61303/annualir0506.pdf|author=Intelligence and Security Committee|authorlink=Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|title=Annual Report 2005–2006|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|

This section applies to everyone.

===Section 6 - Information entrusted in confidence to other States or to international organisations===
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
Section 6 creates an offence of making a "damaging disclosure" which "relates to security or intelligence, defence or international relations" where that information was provided in confidence "by or on behalf of the United Kingdom to another State or to an international organisation" where that person obtained it without that State or organization's authorization, and where no other offence under the earlier sections of this Act applies. Lawful authority and prior authorized disclosure are defences against this offence.

===Section 7 - Authorised disclosures===
Sections 7(1) to (3) provide that a disclosure is made with lawful authority if, and only if, the conditions specified therein are satisfied.

Section 7(4) provides a defence.

Sections 7(5) and (6) define the expressions "official authorisation" and "official restriction".

===Section 8 - Safeguarding of information===
This section makes it a crime for a crown servant or government contractor to retain information beyond their official need for it, and obligates them to properly protect secret information from accidental disclosure.

===Section 9 - Restriction on prosecutions===
Section 9(2) provides that no prosecution for an offence, in respect of any such information, document or other article as is mentioned in section 4(2), may be instituted, in England and Wales, except by or with the consent of the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], or in Northern Ireland, except by or with the consent of the [[Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland]].

Section 9(1) provides that no prosecution for any other offence under this Act may be instituted, in England and Wales, except by or with the consent of the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], or in Northern Ireland, except by or with the consent of the [[Advocate General for Northern Ireland]].

The words "Advocate General for Northern Ireland", in section 9(1), were substituted for the words "[[Attorney General for Northern Ireland]]" by sections 28 and 87 of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/26/schedule/7/paragraph/32/prospective paragraph 32] of Schedule 7 to, the [[Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002]], on 12 April 2010.<ref>The [[Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (Commencement No.14) Order 2010]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2010/113/article/2/made article 2] and the Schedule, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2010/113/schedule/paragraph/19/made paragraph 19(e)].</ref>

===Section 10 - Penalties===
This section provides the penalties and mode of trial for offences under the Act.

Section 10(2) provides that a person guilty of an offence under section 8(1) or 8(4) or 8(5) is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the [[standard scale]], or to both.

The words "51 weeks" are prospectively substituted for the words "three months" in section 10(2) by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/schedule/26/paragraph/39/prospective paragraph 39] of Schedule 26 to the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

===Section 11 - Arrest, search and trial===
====Section 11(1)====
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/6/section/11/enacted Section 11(1)] inserted section 24(2)(bb) into the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. It also omitted the reference to the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]] in section 24(2)(b) of that Act.

It was repealed<ref>The [[Police Reform Act 2002]], section 107 and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/schedule/8 Schedule 8]</ref> on 1 October 2002.<ref>The [[Police Reform Act 2002 (Commencement No. 1) Order 2002]] (S.I. 2002/2036), [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2306/article/2/made article 2(g)(iii)(b)]</ref>

The repeal was consequential on the replacement of section 24(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 with a new Schedule 1A to that Act.

====Section 11(3)====
Section 11(3) extends section 9(1) of the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]] (which relates to [[search warrant]]s).

This section defines the words and expressions "disclose", "disclosure", "international organisation", "prescribed" and "State" for the purposes of the Act.

===Section 14===
This section provides the procedure for making orders under the Act.

===Section 15 - Acts done abroad and extent===
Section 15(1)(a) provides that any act done by a [[British citizen]]s or Crown servant, which would be an offence under any provision of the Act other than sections 8(1) or 8(4) or 8(5) if done by him in the United Kingdom, is an offence under that provision.

This is intended to cover [[espionage]] (where someone travels to a foreign country and discloses secret information to a foreign power) and cases where someone travels to a foreign country and discloses secret information, perhaps to a newspaper.

Section 15(1)(b) provides that any act done by any person in any of the [[Channel Islands]], or in the [[Isle of Man]], or in any colony, which would be an offence under any provision of the Act other than sections 8(1) or 8(4) or 8(5) if done by him in the United Kingdom, is an offence under that provision.

Section 15(3) confers a power on The Queen to extend, by [[Order in Council]], any provision of the Act, subject to any exceptions, adaptations or modifications specified in the Order, to any of the Channel Islands, or to the Isle of Man, or to any colony.

This power was exercised by the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/1301/contents/made Official Secrets Act 1989 (Hong Kong) Order 1992] (S.I. 1992/1301).

===Section 16 - Citation, commencement, amendments, repeals and revocation===

The said territories mentioned in section 15(3) are the [[Channel Islands]], the [[Isle of Man]] and all colonies. Such an Order was made in relation to [[Hong Kong]] (see above).

This section also provides for consequential amendments, repeals, a revocation, and commencement.
