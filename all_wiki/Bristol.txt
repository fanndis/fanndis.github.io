'''Bristol''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Bristol.ogg|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|s|t|əl}}) is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] and county in [[South West England]], with a population of 463,400.<ref>https://www.bristol.gov.uk/statistics-census-information/the-population-of-bristol</ref> It also has status as a ceremonial [[Ceremonial counties of England|county]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Lord-Lieutenant of the County & City of Bristol |url=http://www.lordltbristol.org.uk/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022174137/http://lordltbristol.org.uk/ |archive-date=22 October 2015 |access-date=8 June 2015 |publisher=The Lord-Lieutenant of the County & City of Bristol}}</ref>  (it has a Lord-Lieutenant) although it lost its title as a full administrative county in 1974. The wider district has the 10th-largest population in England.<ref>{{United Kingdom district population citation|England}}</ref> The urban area population of 670,000 is the 11th-largest in the UK.<ref name="UrbanPopulation" /> The city lies between [[Gloucestershire]] to the north and [[Somerset]] to the south. [[South Wales]] lies across the [[Severn estuary]].

[[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s and [[Roman villa]]s were built near the [[confluence]] of the rivers [[River Frome, Bristol|Frome]] and [[River Avon (Bristol)|Avon]], and around the beginning of the 11th century, the settlement was known as Brycgstow ([[Old English]] "the place at the bridge"). Bristol received a [[royal charter]] in 1155 and was [[Historic counties of England|historically]] divided between [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Somerset]] until 1373 when it became a [[County corporate|county of itself]]. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities, after London, in tax receipts; however, it was surpassed by the rapid rise of [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] in the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Bristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 [[John Cabot]], a [[Venice|Venetian]], became the first European to land on mainland North America. In 1499 [[William Weston (explorer)|William Weston]], a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At the height of the [[Bristol slave trade]], from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The [[Port of Bristol]] has since moved from [[Bristol Harbour]] in the city centre to the [[Severn Estuary]] at [[Avonmouth]] and [[Royal Portbury Dock]].

Bristol's modern economy is built on the creative media, electronics and [[aerospace]] industries, and the city-centre docks have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. The city has the largest circulating community currency in the UK; the [[Bristol pound]], which is [[Fixed exchange-rate system|pegged]] to the [[Pound sterling]]. The city has two universities, the [[University of Bristol]] and the [[University of the West of England]], and a variety of artistic and sporting organisations and venues including the [[Royal West of England Academy]], the [[Arnolfini]], [[Spike Island, Bristol|Spike Island]], [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]] and the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]]. It is connected to London and other major UK cities by road and rail, and to the world by sea and air: road, by the [[M5 motorway|M5]] and [[M4 motorway|M4]] (which connect to the city centre by the [[Portway, Bristol|Portway]] and [[M32 motorway|M32]]); rail, via [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]] and [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] mainline rail stations; and [[Bristol Airport]].

One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top ten cities by international travel publishers [[Dorling Kindersley]] in their ''[[Eyewitness Books|Eyewitness]]'' series of travel guides. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' named it as the best city in Britain in which to live in 2014 and 2017, and Bristol also won the [[European Union|EU's]] [[European Green Capital Award]] in 2015.

==Etymology==
Early recorded place names in the Bristol area include the Roman-era [[Common Brittonic|British Celtic]] ''Abona'' (derived from the name of the [[River Avon, Bristol|Avon]]) and the [[Welsh language|archaic Welsh]] ''Caer Odor'' ("fort on the chasm"), which may have been [[calque]]d as the modern English ''Clifton''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Higgins |first=David |title=The history of the Bristol region in the Roman period |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/bristolrecordsociety/publications/bha115.pdf}}</ref><ref>James Fawckner Nicholls and John Taylor, ''Bristol Past and Present: Civil History'' (1881), p. 6</ref>

The current name "Bristol" derives from the [[Old English]] form ''Brycgstow'', which is typically etymologised as ''place at the bridge''.{{sfn|Little|1967|p=ix}} However, other derivations have been proposed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Seyer |first=Samuel |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirshistorica02seye |title=Memoirs, Historical and Topographical of Bristol and its Neighborhood |date=1823 |publisher=Bristol, Printed for the author by J.

===Middle Ages===
Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a [[Mint (coin)|mint]] producing silver pennies bearing its name.{{sfn|Lobel|Carus-Wilson|1975|pp=2–3}} By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified ''[[burh]]'', and that year the townsmen beat back a raiding party from Ireland led by three of [[Harold Godwinson]]'s sons.{{sfn|Lobel|Carus-Wilson|1975|pp=2–3}} Under [[Normans|Norman]] rule, the town had one of the strongest [[Bristol Castle|castles]] in southern England.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Impregnable City |url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/bristol/castle.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615133941/http://www.buildinghistory.org/bristol/castle.shtml |archive-date=15 June 2008 |access-date=7 October 2007 |publisher=Bristol Past}}</ref> Bristol was the place of exile for [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], the Irish [[king of Leinster]], after being overthrown.

The city was associated with Victorian engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], who designed the [[Great Western Railway]] between Bristol and [[London Paddington station|London Paddington]], two pioneering Bristol-built oceangoing [[Steamboat|steamships]] ({{SS|Great Britain}} and {{SS|Great Western}}), and the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]]. The new railway replaced the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]], which had fully opened in 1810 as the main route for the transport of goods between Bristol and London.{{sfn| Clew |1970 |pp=79–80}} Competition from Liverpool (beginning around 1760), disruptions of maritime commerce due to war with France (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to Bristol's failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of [[Northern England]] and the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]. The tidal Avon Gorge, which had secured the port during the Middle Ages, had become a liability. An 1804–09 plan to improve the city's port with a [[Bristol Harbour|floating harbour]] designed by [[William Jessop]] was a costly error, requiring high harbour fees.{{sfn|Buchanan|Cossons|1969|pp=32–33}}

Bristol's boundaries can be defined in several ways, including those of the city itself, the developed area, or [[Greater Bristol]].

The [[Politics of Bristol|city council]] boundary is the narrowest definition of the city itself. However, it unusually includes a large, roughly rectangular section of the western [[Severn Estuary]] ending at (but not including) the islands of [[Steep Holm]] and [[Flat Holm]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Area boundary for the Bristol unitary authority |url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/keystats/sqmap.aspx?kv=1312817302&type=-1&title=Bristol%3b+City+of+UA+ |access-date=1 January 2009 |website=NOMIS Labour market statistics |publisher=Office for National Statistics}}</ref> This "seaward extension" can be traced back to the original boundary of the County of Bristol laid out in the charter granted to the city by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1373.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=December 1930 |editor-last=Harding |editor-first=N.

The [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) has defined a [[Bristol Urban Area]], which includes developed areas adjoining Bristol but outside the city-council boundary, such as [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire|Kingswood]], [[Mangotsfield]], [[Stoke Gifford]], [[Winterbourne, Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], [[Almondsbury]], [[Easton in Gordano]], [[Whitchurch, Bristol|Whitchurch]] village, [[Filton]], [[Patchway]] and [[Bradley Stoke]], but excludes undeveloped areas within that boundary.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pointer |first=Graham |year=2005 |title=The UK's major urban areas |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fom2005/03_fopm_urbanareas.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628203215/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fom2005/03_FOPM_UrbanAreas.pdf |archive-date=28 June 2011 |access-date=21 June 2011 |website=Focus on People and Migration |publisher=Office for National Statistics}}</ref>

=== Geography ===
Bristol lies within a [[limestone]] area running from the [[Mendip Hills]] in the south to the [[Cotswolds]] in the northeast.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cotswolds AONB |url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=Map |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091538/http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=Map |archive-date=10 May 2011 |access-date=12 June 2011 |publisher=Cotswold AONB}}</ref> The rivers Avon and Frome cut through the limestone to the underlying clay, creating Bristol's characteristically hilly landscape. The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through [[Floodplain|flood plains]] and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon cuts through the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, formed largely by glacial meltwater after the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]].<ref name="10.1144/GSL">{{Cite journal |last=Hawkins |first=Alfred Brian |year=1973 |title=The geology and slopes of the Bristol region |journal=Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology |volume=6 |issue=3–4 |pages=185–205 |doi=10.1144/GSL.QJEG.1973.006.03.02|s2cid=129044127 }}</ref>

The gorge, which helped protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone to build the city, and its surrounding land has been protected from development as [[The Downs, Bristol|The Downs]] and Leigh Woods. The Avon [[estuary]] and the gorge form the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the [[Severn Estuary]] at [[Avonmouth]]. A smaller gorge, cut by the [[Hazel Brook]] which flows into the [[River Trym]], crosses the [[Blaise Castle]] estate in northern Bristol.<ref name="10.1144/GSL" />

Bristol is sometimes described, by its inhabitants, as being built on seven hills. Local hills include Red Lion Hill, [[Barton Hill, Bristol|Barton Hill]], [[Lawrence Hill, Bristol|Lawrence Hill]], St. Michaels Hill, Black Boy Hill, Constitution Hill, [[Staple Hill, Gloucestershire|Staple Hill]], [[Brandon Hill, Bristol|Brandon Hill]], [[Windmill Hill, Bristol|Windmill Hill]], Malborough Hill, Nine Tree Hill, Talbot, Brook Hill and Granby Hill.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Taylor |first=John |url=https://archive.org/details/abookaboutbrist00taylgoog |title=A Book about Bristol: Historical, Ecclesiastical, and Biographical, from Original Research |date=1872 |publisher=Houlston and Sons |page=[https://archive.org/details/abookaboutbrist00taylgoog/page/n18 10]}}</ref>

Bristol is {{convert|106|mi|km}} west of London, {{convert|77|mi|km}} south-southwest of [[Birmingham]] and {{convert|26|mi|km}} east of the Welsh capital [[Cardiff]].

=== Green belt ===
{{main|Avon Green Belt}}
The city has green belt mainly along its southern fringes, taking in small areas within the [[Ashton Court|Ashton Court Estate]], South Bristol crematorium and cemetery, High Ridge common and Whitchurch, with a further area around Frenchay Farm. The belt extends outside the city boundaries into surrounding counties and districts, for several miles in places, to afford a protection from urban sprawl to surrounding villages and towns.

During the mid-19th century [[Bristol Byzantine]], a style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived.

Until recently Bristolese was characterised by retention of the second-person singular, as in the [[doggerel]] "Cassn't see what bist looking at? Cassn't see as well as couldst, casst? And if couldst, 'ouldn't, 'ouldst?" The West Saxon ''bist'' is used for the English ''art'',{{sfn|Black|1996|p=172}} and children were admonished with "Thee and thou, the Welshman's cow". In Bristolian, as in French and German, the second-person singular was not used when speaking to a superior (except by the egalitarian [[Quakers]]). The pronoun ''thee'' is also used in the subject position ("What bist thee doing?"), and ''I'' or ''he'' in the object position ("Give he to I.").{{sfn|Strohmeyer|2009|p=13}} Linguist [[Stanley Ellis (linguist)|Stanley Ellis]], who found that many dialect words in the Filton area were linked to aerospace work, described Bristolian as "a cranky, crazy, crab-apple tree of language and with the sharpest, juiciest flavour that I've heard for a long time".{{sfn|Elmes|2005|p=39}}
