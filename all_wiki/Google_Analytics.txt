'''Google Analytics''' is a [[web analytics]] service offered by [[Google]] that tracks and reports website traffic, currently as a platform inside the Google Marketing Platform brand.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.google.com/analytics/premium/features.html | title = Get the Power of Google Analytics: Now available in Standard or Premium, whatever your needs are Google Analytics can help. | accessdate = 2012-04-08 }}</ref> Google launched the service in November 2005 after acquiring [[Urchin (software)|Urchin]].<ref name="Google">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/about/company/history/|title=Our history in depth|accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/29/technology/google-acquires-urchin-software.html|title=Google Acquires Urchin Software|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2005-03-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

As of 2019, Google Analytics is the most widely used web analytics service on the web.<ref name="W3Techs_trafficanalysis">{{cite web|url=http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/traffic_analysis/all |title=Usage of traffic analysis tools for websites |publisher=W3Techs |date = 27 February 2019| accessdate = 27 February 2019 }} Site frequently updated.</ref> Google Analytics provides an [[software development kit|SDK]] that allows gathering usage data from [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]], known as ''Google Analytics for Mobile Apps''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/mobile|title=Google Analytics for Mobile Apps {{!}} Analytics Implementation Guides and Solutions {{!}} Google Developers|website=Google Developers|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}</ref> Google Analytics can be blocked by browsers, browser extensions, firewalls and other means.

Google Analytics has undergone many versions since its inception. It is currently on its 4th iteration of the platform which is called GA4.<ref>https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4</ref> GA4, now being the default Google Analytics installation, is the renamed version for the App+Web Property that Google had released in 2019 in a Beta form. GA4 has currently replaced UA, Universal Analytics. One notable feature of GA4 is a natural integration with Google's [[BigQuery|Big Query]] a feature previously only available with the enterprise GA 360. This move indicates efforts by Google to integrate GA and it's free users into their wider cloud offering.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

==Features==
Google Analytics is used to [[web tracking|track]] website activity such as [[session (web analytics)|session]] duration, pages per session, [[bounce rate]] etc. of individuals using the site, along with the information on the source of the traffic. It can be integrated with [[Google Ads]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704341?co=ADWORDS.IsAWNCustomer=false&hl=en|title=Link Google Analytics and Google Ads accounts - Previous - Google Ads Help|website=support.google.com|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> with which users can create and review online campaigns by tracking landing page quality and [[Conversion (marketing)|conversions]] (goals). Goals might include sales, lead generation, viewing a specific page, or downloading a particular file.<ref>{{Citation | url   = http://cerebromarketing.us/how-goals-work-in-google-analytics-and-adwords/ | title   = How do Goals work in Analytics and Adwords? | publisher   = Cerebro Marketing | accessdate   = February 17, 2016 | url-status   = dead | archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306092846/http://cerebromarketing.us/how-goals-work-in-google-analytics-and-adwords/ | archivedate   = March 6, 2016 }}</ref> Google Analytics' approach is to show high-level, [[Dashboard (business)|dashboard]]-type data for the casual user, and more in-depth data further into the report set. Google Analytics analysis can identify poorly performing pages with techniques such as funnel visualization, where visitors came from ([[referrer]]s), how long they stayed on the website and their geographical position. It also provides more advanced features, including custom visitor segmentation.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3124493?hl=en | title = Build new segments | accessdate = August 8, 2017}}</ref> Google Analytics [[e-commerce]] reporting can track sales activity and performance.

On September 29, 2011, Google Analytics launched Real Time analytics, enabling a user to have insight about visitors currently on the site.<ref name="GoogleBlogHappening2011">{{cite web|url=https://analytics.googleblog.com/2011/09/whats-happening-on-your-site-right-now.html|title=What's happening on your site right now?}}</ref> A user can have 100 site profiles. Each profile generally corresponds to one [[website]]. It is limited to sites which have traffic of fewer than 5 million pageviews per month (roughly 2 pageviews per second) unless the site is linked to a Google Ads campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=55476|title=Google Analytics Help: Does Google Analytics have a pageview limit?}}</ref> Google Analytics includes [[Google Website Optimizer]], rebranded as ''Google Analytics Content Experiments''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer/|title=Website Optimizer|access-date=2012-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tzemah|first=Nir|title=Helping to Create Better Websites: Introducing Content Experiments|url=http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/06/helping-to-create-better-websites.html|work=Google Analytics Blog|access-date=2012-06-04}}</ref> Google Analytics' [[Cohort analysis]] helps in understanding the behaviour of component groups of users apart from your user population. It is beneficial to marketers and analysts for successful implementation of a marketing strategy.

==History==
Google acquired Urchin Software Corp. in April 2005.<ref name="Google"/> Google's service was developed from [[Urchin (software)|Urchin on Demand]]. The system also brings ideas from Adaptive Path, whose product, Measure Map, was acquired and used in the redesign of Google Analytics in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/here-comes-measure-map.html|title=Here comes Measure Map|publisher=}}</ref> Google continued to sell the standalone, installable Urchin WebAnalytics Software through a network of [[value-added reseller]]s until discontinuation on March 28, 2012.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web | url = http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/01/end-of-era-for-urchin-software.html | title = The End of an Era for Urchin Software | date = January 20, 2012 | first = Paul | last = Muret | publisher = Google Analytics | access-date = 2012-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413093651/https://www.google.com/urchin/ |archive-date=2012-04-13 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web | url = https://www.google.com/urchin/ | title = The End of an Era for Urchin Software | first = Paul | last = Muret | publisher = Google Analytics | accessdate = 2012-04-07 }}</ref> The Google-branded version was rolled out in November 2005 to anyone who wished to sign up. However, due to extremely high demand for the service, new sign-ups were suspended only a week later. As capacity was added to the system, Google began using a [[lottery]]-type invitation-code model. Before August 2006, Google was sending out batches of invitation codes as server availability permitted; since mid-August 2006 the service has been fully available to all users – whether they use Google for advertising or not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/zenbatetanola/02-google-analytics|title=Google Analytics - zenbatetanola|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}</ref>

The newer version of Google Analytics tracking code is known as the asynchronous tracking code,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=161379 | title = Asynchronous Tracking Code }}</ref> which Google claims is significantly more sensitive and accurate, and is able to track even very short activities on the website. The previous version delayed page loading, and so, for performance reasons, it was generally placed just before the <code><nowiki></body></nowiki></code> body close HTML tag. The new code can be placed between the <code><nowiki><head>...</head></nowiki></code> HTML head tags because, once triggered, it runs in parallel with page loading.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://online-behavior.com/analytics/google-tag-manager|title=Google Tag Manager: A Step-By-Step Guide {{!}} Analytics & Optimization|website=online-behavior.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}</ref> In April 2011 Google announced the availability of a new version of Google Analytics featuring multiple dashboards, more custom report options, and a new interface design.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/04/new-google-analytics-available-to.html | title = The New Google Analytics Available to Everyone }}</ref> This version was later updated with some other features such as real-time analytics and [[goal]] flow charts.<ref name="GoogleBlogHappening2011" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/10/introducing-flow-visualization.html | title = Introducing Flow Visualization: visualizing visitor flow }}</ref>

In October 2012 another new version of Google Analytics was announced, called ''Universal Analytics.''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/10/universal-analytics.html | title=Re-imagining Google Analytics to support the versatile usage patterns of today's users}}</ref> The key differences from the previous versions were: cross-platform tracking, flexible tracking code to collect data from any device, and the introduction of custom dimensions and custom metrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2790010?hl=en|title=About Universal Analytics - Analytics Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>

In March 2016, Google released ''Google Analytics 360'', which is a [[software suite]] that provides analytics on [[return on investment]] and other marketing indicators. Google Analytics 360 includes five main products: Analytics, Tag Manager, Optimize, Data Studio, Surveys, Attribution, and Audience Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/introducing-google-analytics-360-suite/|title=Introducing the Google Analytics 360 suite|website=Google|last=Muret|first=Paul|date=2016-03-15|accessdate=2018-10-07}}</ref>

In October 2017 a new version of Google Analytics was announced, called ''Global Site Tag''. Its stated purpose was to unify the tagging system to simplify implementation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/ | title=Add gtag.js to your site}}</ref>

In June 2018, Google introduced ''Google Marketing Platform'', an [[Online advertising|online advertisement]] and [[Online analytical processing|analytics]] brand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/new-advertising-brands/|title=Introducing simpler brands and solutions for advertisers and publishers|date=2018-06-27|work=Google|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}</ref> It consists of two former brands of Google, [[DoubleClick|DoubleClick Digital Marketing]] and Google Analytics 360.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/google-doubleclick-adwords-rebranding-1202859088/|title=Google Killing Off DoubleClick, AdWords Names in Rebranding of Ad Products|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2018-06-27|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}</ref>

In October 2020, Google released Google Analytics 4, under the acronym GA4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/new_google_analytics|title=Introducing the new Google Analytics|website=Google|last=Srinivasan|first=Vidhya|date=2020-10-14|accessdate=2020-10-16}}</ref>

==Technology==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}
Google Analytics is implemented with "[[Web beacon|page tag]]s", in this case, called the Google Analytics Tracking Code,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/seo/reporting/google-analytics-event-tracking/?unapproved=2220589&moderation-hash=3f6ed00ccc19a7132d4fd61312754533#comment-2220589|title=How To Use Google Analytics Event Tracking|last=|first=|date=January 9, 2020|website=Matthew Woodward|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|layurl=}}</ref> which is a snippet of [[JavaScript]] code that the website owner adds to every page of the website. The tracking code runs in the client browser when the client browses the page (if JavaScript is enabled in the browser) and collects visitor data and sends it to a Google data collection [[Server (computing)|server]] as part of a request for a [[web beacon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsTrackingOverview|title=Tracking Code Overview &#124; Google Analytics|website=Google Developers}}</ref>

The tracking code loads a larger [[JavaScript]] file from the [[Google web server]] and then sets variables with the user's account number. The larger file (currently known as ga.js) was typically 40&nbsp;kB as of May 2018.

The file does not usually have to be loaded, however, due to browser caching. Assuming caching is enabled in the browser, it downloads ga.js only once at the start of the visit. Furthermore, as all websites that implement Google Analytics with the ga.js code use the same master file from Google, a browser that has previously visited any other website running Google Analytics will already have the file cached on their machine.

In addition to transmitting information to a Google server, the tracking code sets a [[Web analytics#Problems with cookies|first party cookie]] (If [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] are enabled in the browser) on each visitor's computer. This cookie stores anonymous information called the ClientId.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/domains |title=Cookies and User Identification |website=developers.google.com}}</ref> Before the launch of Universal Analytics, there were several cookies storing information such as whether the visitor had been to the site before (new or returning visitor), the [[timestamp]] of the current visit, and the [[referrer]] site or campaign that directed the visitor to the page (e.g., [[Web search engine|search engine]], keywords, banner, or [[email]]).

If the visitor arrived at the site by clicking on a link tagged with {{anchor|Urchin Traffic Monitor}}[[UTM parameters]] (Urchin Tracking Module) such as:
:<nowiki>https://www.example.com/page</nowiki>?<mark>utm_content=buffercf3b2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer</mark>

then the tag values are passed to the database too.

===Limitations===
In addition, Google Analytics for Mobile Package allows Google Analytics to be applied to mobile websites. The Mobile Package contains server-side tracking codes that use [[PHP]], [[JavaServer Pages]], [[ASP.NET]], or [[Perl]] for its server-side language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/intl/en/mobile/analytics/docs/web/ |title=Google Analytics for Mobile package |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124153755/http://code.google.com/intl/en/mobile/analytics/docs/web/ |archivedate=2013-01-24 }}</ref> However, many [[ad filtering]] programs and extensions such as [[Firefox]]'s Enhanced Tracking Protection,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop#w_what-enhanced-tracking-protection-blocks|title=Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox for desktop {{!}} Firefox Help|website=support.mozilla.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> the browser extension [[NoScript]] and the mobile phone app [[Disconnect Mobile]] can block the Google Analytics Tracking Code. This prevents some traffic and users from being tracked and leads to holes in the collected data. Also, privacy networks like [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] will mask the user's actual location and present inaccurate geographical data. A small fraction of users don't have JavaScript-enabled/capable browsers or turn this feature off.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blockmetry.com/blog/javascript-disabled|title=What percentage of browsers with javascript disabled? - Blockmetry|website=blockmetry.com|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> These limitations, mainly ad filtering programs, can allow a significant amount of visitors to avoid the tracker, sometimes more than the majority.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chetty|first=Marshini|last2=Narayanan|first2=Arvind|last3=Vitak|first3=Jessica|last4=Mathur|first4=Arunesh|date=2018|title=Characterizing the Use of Browser-Based Blocking Extensions To Prevent Online Tracking|url=https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2018/presentation/mathur|language=en|pages=103–116|isbn=9781939133106}}</ref>

One potential impact on data accuracy comes from users deleting or blocking Google Analytics cookies.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.advanced-web-metrics.com/blog/2008/02/16/accuracy-whitepaper/ | title = Accuracy Whitepaper for web analytics | author = Brian Clifton}}</ref> Without cookies being set, Google Analytics cannot collect data.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Any individual web user can block or delete cookies resulting in the data loss of those visits for Google Analytics users. Website owners can encourage users not to disable cookies; for example, by making visitors more comfortable using the site through posting a [[privacy policy]]. These limitations affect the majority of [[web analytics]] tools which use page tags (usually [[JavaScript]] programs) embedded in web pages to collect visitor data, store it in cookies on the visitor's computer, and transmit it to a remote database by pretending to load a tiny graphic "[[Web bug|beacon]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Another limitation of Google Analytics for large websites is the use of [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] in the generation of many of its reports. To reduce the load on their servers and to provide users with a relatively quick response to their query, Google Analytics limits reports to 500,000 randomly sampled sessions at the profile level for its calculations. While [[Margin of error|margins of error]] are indicated for the visits metric, margins of error are not provided for any other metrics in the Google Analytics reports. For small segments of data, the margin of error can be very large.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epikone.com/blog/2009/04/21/segmentation-options-in-google-analytics/ |title=Segmentation Options in Google Analytics |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622173444/http://www.epikone.com/blog/2009/04/21/segmentation-options-in-google-analytics/ |archivedate=2009-06-22 }}</ref>

==Performance==
There have been several online discussions about the impact of Google Analytics on site performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/analytics-help-basics/browse_thread/thread/62997a00d5a50406?pli=1|title=Google Groups}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.analyticsmarket.com/blog/tracking-code-slows-my-site|title=Google Analytics Code is Slowing Down My Site - Analytics Market|publisher=|date=2019-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woopra.com/blog/2009/02/04/is-google-analytics-slow-or-not/|title=Is Google Analytics Slow or Not? — Woopra|date=4 February 2009|access-date=8 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215174004/http://www.woopra.com/blog/2009/02/04/is-google-analytics-slow-or-not/|archive-date=15 February 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, Google introduced asynchronous JavaScript code in December 2009 to reduce the risk of slowing the loading of pages tagged with the ga.js script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-analytics-launches-asynchronous.html|title=Google Analytics Launches Asynchronous Tracking - The official Google Code blog|date=1 December 2009|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://analytics.googleblog.com/2010/04/making-web-faster.html|title=Making the Web Faster|publisher=}}</ref>
<!-- Google Analytics has introduced new user interface in 2011- 2012 period. Unfortunately, the new interface was missing a lot of functions like analyzing data from different search engines, which can be important for doing [[Search_engine_optimization|SEO]]. Since Google Analytics users rejected it outright, Google was unable to withdraw (sunset) the old version, even though they had announced that old user interface will be removed January 2012. -->

==Privacy==
{{main|Browser security|Privacy concerns regarding Google}}
Due to its ubiquity, Google Analytics raises some privacy concerns. Whenever someone visits a website that uses Google Analytics, Google tracks that visit via the users' [[IP address]] in order to determine the user's approximate geographic location. To meet German legal requirements, Google Analytics can anonymize the IP address.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/methods/gaJSApi_gat#_gat._anonymizeIp |title=Tracking Code: The _gat Global Object |date=January 24, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> Google has also released a browser plug-in that turns off data about a page visit being sent to Google, however this browser extension is not available for mobile browsers.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2364174,00.asp | title =  Opt Out of Google Analytics Data Gathering With New Beta Tool | first = Chloe | last = Albanesius | date = May 25, 2010 | work=PC Magazine }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://analytics.blogspot.jp/2010/05/greater-choice-and-transparency-for.html | title =  Greater choice and transparency for Google Analytics | date = May 25, 2010 }}</ref> Since this plug-in is produced and distributed by Google itself, it has met much discussion and criticism. Furthermore, the realization of Google scripts tracking user behavior has spawned the production of multiple, often [[Open-source software|open-source]], browser plug-ins to reject tracking cookies.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://noscript.net/ | title = The NoScript Firefox extension provides extra protection for Firefox, Flock, Seamonkey and other Mozilla-based browsers }}</ref> These plug-ins allow users to block Google Analytics and similar sites from tracking their activities. However, partially because of new [[General Data Protection Regulation|European privacy laws]], most modern browsers allow users to reject tracking cookies, though [[Flash cookies]] can be a separate problem.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

It has been anecdotally reported that errors can occur behind proxy servers and multiple firewalls, changing timestamps and registering invalid searches.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/2008/12/11/virus-filter-avira-tech-security-cx_ag_1211virus.html | title = The Virus Filters | date = December 11, 2008 | first = Andy | last = Greenberg | work = Forbes }}</ref> Webmasters who seek to mitigate Google Analytics' specific privacy issues can employ a number of [[List of web analytics software#Free / Open source (FLOSS)|alternatives having their backends hosted on their own machines]].

==Popularity==
Google Analytics is the most widely used website statistics service.<ref name="W3Techs_trafficanalysis"/> In May 2008, [[Pingdom]] released a survey stating that 161 of the 500 (32%) biggest sites globally according to their Alexa rank were using Google Analytics.<ref name="Pingdom">{{cite web|publisher=[[Pingdom]]|url=http://royal.pingdom.com/2008/05/28/google-analytics-dominate-the-top-500-websites/|title=Google Analytics dominates the top 500 websites|accessdate=2012-07-17|date=2008-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frikipandi.com/internet/20140403/la-terminologia-de-google-analytics-marketing-seo/|title=La terminología de Google Analytics #marketing #seo|date=April 3, 2014|website=Frikipandi - Web de Tecnología - Lo más Friki de la red.}}</ref>
