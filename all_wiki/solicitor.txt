A '''solicitor''' is a [[legal practitioner]] who traditionally deals with most of the legal matters in some [[jurisdiction]]s. A person must have [[Admission to practice law|legally-defined qualifications]], which vary from one jurisdiction to another, to be described as a solicitor and enabled to practise there as such. For example, in [[England and Wales]] a solicitor is admitted to practise under the provisions of the [[Solicitors Act 1974]]. With some exceptions, practising solicitors must possess a [[practising certificate]]. There are many more solicitors than [[barrister]]s in England; they undertake the general aspects of giving legal advice and conducting legal proceedings.<ref>A Dictionary of Law (7 ed.), J Law and EA Martin, Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9780191726729}}</ref>

In the [[jurisdictions]] of [[England and Wales]] and in [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]], in the [[Australia]]n states of [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Queensland]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Africa]] (where they are called ''[[Attorneys in South Africa|attorneys]]'') and the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[legal profession]] is split between solicitors and [[barrister]]s (called [[Advocate#Scotland|''advocates'']] in some countries, for example [[Scots law|Scotland]]), and a lawyer will usually only hold one of the two titles. However, in [[Canada]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]] and the remaining Australian states and territories, the legal profession is now for practical purposes "[[Fused profession|fused]]", allowing lawyers to hold the title of "barrister and solicitor" and practise as both. Some legal graduates will start off as one and then also qualify as the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspiringsolicitors.co.uk/converting-barrister-solicitor/|title=Converting From Barrister To Solicitor|work=Aspiring Solicitors|accessdate=17 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927115920/http://www.aspiringsolicitors.co.uk/converting-barrister-solicitor/|archivedate=27 September 2015}}<br>- {{cite web|url=http://www.moretolaw.com/interesting/excitysolicitorswitchestothebar.php|title=Ex-Freshfields solicitor switches to the Bar|accessdate=17 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154331/http://www.moretolaw.com/interesting/excitysolicitorswitchestothebar.php|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref>

==Australia==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
Regulation of the profession in Australia varies from state to state. Admission to practice is state-based, although mutual recognition enables a practitioner admitted in any state or territory to practise in any other state or territory, or at the federal level. In all states and territories, solicitors have unlimited rights of audience and so can, at least in theory, practise as a solicitor, barrister or both. The formal names for admitted solicitors differs between jurisdictions. For example, in some jurisdictions, they are admitted as "legal practitioners", while in other jurisdictions they are admitted as "solicitors and barristers"

The extent to which the profession is "fused" in practice varies from state to state. In general, however, there is a separate bar with its own professional body composed of those practitioners who adopt the traditional barrister's model of practice, i.e. working in chambers and undertaking advocacy work. In some states, [[call to the bar]] requires different or additional training. A proportion of the other practitioners would practise as both solicitors and barristers, while still others would practice primarily or exclusively as solicitors. The relative sizes of the latter two categories differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

==England and Wales==
{{CourtsEnglandWales}}
{{main|Legal professions in England and Wales}}
Before the creation of the [[Senior Courts of England and Wales|Supreme Court of Judicature]] under the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873]], solicitors practised in [[equity (law)|equity]] in the [[Court of Chancery]], [[attorney-at-law|attorneys]] practised in the [[common law]] courts, and [[proctor]]s practised in the "civil law" (based on Roman law) of the [[ecclesiastical courts]]. The monopoly of the proctors in family, inheritance and admiralty law had been removed in 1857–1859, and the 1873 reforms further fused all three branches of the profession. After 1873 the offices of "attorney" and "proctor" disappeared as terms relating to legally qualified persons, being replaced by "Solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and Wales", except for the unique government offices of [[Queen's Proctor|Queen's (or King's) Proctor]] (now called "HM Procurator-General", a title generally held by the [[Treasury Solicitor]]), and [[Attorney-General]].<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref> Since the replacement of the judicial aspect of the House of Lords with a new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, separate from the existing Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, the full title of a solicitor is "Solicitor of the Senior Courts of England and Wales".<ref>Solicitors Journal 5 October 2009</ref>

The term "attorney" is however still used under English law to refer to someone legally appointed or empowered (who may but need not be legally qualified) to act for another person. Currently, the term is most commonly used to refer to someone so appointed under a "power of attorney". This may be a "general power of attorney";<ref>Powers of Attorney Act 1971 section 10</ref> a [[lasting power of attorney]] may be granted under the provisions of the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. Some practitioners in specialist professions, notably intellectual property, are also referred to as attorneys, for example [[registered patent attorney]]s, which is a separate qualification to that of a solicitor.

===Solicitors and barristers===
In the English legal system, solicitors traditionally dealt with any legal matter, including conducting proceedings in courts, although solicitors were required to engage a barrister as advocate in a High Court or above after the profession split in two. Minor criminal cases are tried in [[magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]s, which constitute by far the majority of courts. More serious criminal cases still start in the magistrates' court and may then be transferred to a higher court.

The majority of civil cases are tried in county courts and are almost always handled by solicitors. Cases of higher value (£100,000 or above) and those of unusual complexity are tried in the High Court, and barristers, as the other branch of the English legal profession, have traditionally carried out the functions of advocacy in the [[High Court]], [[Crown Court]] and [[Court of Appeal]].

In the past, barristers did not deal with the public directly. This rigid separation no longer applies. [[Solicitor advocates]] with extended rights of audience may now act as advocates at all levels of the courts. Conversely, the public may now hire and interact with a barrister directly in certain types of work without having to go to a solicitor first<ref>[http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/about/publicaccess/ Public Access] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131173018/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/about/publicaccess/ |date=31 January 2009 }}</ref> as a result of the [[Courts and Legal Services Act 1990]] removing the monopoly of barristers to act as advocates and granting solicitors [[rights of audience]] in specified circumstances.

Solicitors now frequently appear in the lower courts and, subject to passing a test and thereby obtaining higher rights of audience, increasingly in the higher courts such as the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]. While the independent bar continued to exist in a largely unchanged state, a few firms of solicitors employed their own barristers and [[solicitor advocates]] to do some of their court work. The rules preventing barristers from being directly instructed were revised to allow direct instruction by certain organizations such as trade unions, accountants, and similar groups. Additionally, barristers who have completed the Bar Council's "Public Access" course can take instructions directly from members of the public under the [[Public Access Scheme]].

Regulation of both barristers and solicitors was reviewed by [[David Clementi]] on behalf of the [[Ministry of Justice]] in 2004. He delivered his final recommendations in December 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-services-review.org.uk/|publisher=Legal Services Review|title=Clementi Review of Legal Services|accessdate=22 April 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412051525/http://www.legal-services-review.org.uk/|archivedate=12 April 2009}}</ref> which included proposals for a more unified regulatory system and new structures for cross-profession work. Many of his recommendations were enshrined in the [[Legal Services Act 2007]].

The breakdown in the strict separation between barrister and solicitor was expected to go further following recognition by the Act of the so-called "Legal Disciplinary Practice (LDP)"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/advice/practice-notes/legal-disciplinary-practice/|title=Legal disciplinary practice|accessdate=17 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815234854/http://lawsociety.org.uk/Advice/Practice-notes/Legal-disciplinary-practice/|archivedate=15 August 2014}}</ref> (from 31 March 2009) and "Alternate Business Structure (ABS)"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/advice/practice-notes/alternative-business-structures/|title=Alternative business structures|accessdate=17 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808202751/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/advice/practice-notes/alternative-business-structures/|archivedate=8 August 2014}}</ref> (from 6 October 2011) bodies, which allow more flexibly structured legal practices.

===Regulatory scheme===
Solicitors in England and Wales who wish to practise must pay an annual fee to obtain a practising certificate. This fee is paid to the [[Law Society of England and Wales]], which represents the profession. The [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]], though funded by these fees, acts independently of the Law Society. Together, the two bodies make up the complete system of professional regulation for solicitors. Complaints about solicitors, if not satisfactorily resolved by the solicitors' firm, may be made to the Legal Ombudsman.

===Training and qualifications===
The training and qualification required to enter the profession by being admitted as a solicitor is regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. There are two graduate routes of entry into the profession. Prospective solicitors holding a qualifying law degree<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org.uk/students/academic-stage.page|title=SRA - Academic Stage|publisher=Solicitors Regulation Authority|accessdate=4 January 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216044110/http://www.sra.org.uk/students/academic-stage.page|archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref> proceed to studying the [[Legal Practice Course]]. Those holding a non-law degree must in addition have completed a [[Graduate Diploma in Law|conversion course]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org.uk/students/conversion-courses.page|publisher=Solicitors Regulation Authority|title=SRA - Conversion Course|accessdate=4 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218100532/http://www.sra.org.uk/students/conversion-courses.page|archivedate=18 December 2008}}</ref> prior to enrolling on the [[Legal Practice Course]]. Once the Legal Practice Course has been completed, the prospective solicitor usually must then undertake two years' apprenticeship, known as a [[training contract]], with a firm entitled to take trainee solicitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org.uk/students/training-contract.page|title=SRA - Training contract information|publisher=Solicitors Regulation Authority|accessdate=4 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227075521/http://www.sra.org.uk/students/training-contract.page|archivedate=27 December 2008}}</ref> The Legal Practice Course and training contract can also be undertaken simultaneously although this is less usual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/law-careers/becoming-a-solicitor/training-contracts/|title=Period of recognised training (training contract)|accessdate=17 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829075353/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/law-careers/becoming-a-solicitor/training-contracts/|archivedate=29 August 2015}}</ref> The training contract was formerly known as an articled clerkship.

It is possible to qualify as a solicitor without having attended university by being admitted as a [[Legal executive|Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives]], and thereafter completing the required number of years of practical experience, and studying for the Legal Practice Course.

=== Overseas qualified lawyers ===
Lawyers qualified in foreign jurisdictions, as well as English barristers, can take the [[Qualified Lawyers Transfer Scheme|Qualified Lawyers Transfer Scheme (QLTS)]] assessment, a fast-track route for qualification as an English solicitor which can be completed in a shorter or longer period of time, depending on the legal background of the candidate. There is no training or experience requirement under the QLTS, which comprises two assessments; a multiple choice test (180 multiple choice questions on 14 subject matters) and two practical assessments, the OSCE1 and OSCE2 which include nine written papers, three oral papers and three mixed written-oral papers on the most important areas of practice for solicitors (business law, probate, conveyancing, civil litigation, criminal litigation). The scheme is open to qualified lawyers in many [[common law]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, such as the US, Australia, South Africa, Nigeria, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Pakistan, all EU member states, as well as other countries.

==Hong Kong==
Hong Kong has maintained the distinction between solicitors, regulated by [[The Law Society of Hong Kong]], and barristers, regulated by the [[Hong Kong Bar Association]]. A person intending to become a solicitor must have a professional law degree, either LL.B. or JD or the equivalent, and complete the one-year [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] (P.C.LL.) course. They must also complete a two-year trainee solicitor contract with a law firm. All solicitors in Hong Kong are admitted to the High Court of Hong Kong and thus bear the full title of "Solicitor of the High Court of Hong Kong".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hklawsoc.org.hk/pub_e/admission/admissionasaSolicitor.asp|title=The Law Society of Hong Kong : Hong Kong Solicitors|website=www.hklawsoc.org.hk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121218182925/http://www.hklawsoc.org.hk/pub_e/admission/admissionasaSolicitor.asp|archivedate=18 December 2012}}</ref>

Solicitors enjoy rights of audience in the lower court and in chamber hearings in the High Court. For hearings in open court in the [[High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|High Court]] and the [[Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal|Court of Final Appeal]], only solicitors who have been certified as solicitor advocates may appear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hk-lawyer.org/content/solicitors-gain-higher-rights-audience|title=Solicitors gain higher rights of audience - Hong Kong Lawyer|website=www.hk-lawyer.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513212153/http://www.hk-lawyer.org/content/solicitors-gain-higher-rights-audience|archivedate=13 May 2018}}</ref>

==Ireland==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
Solicitors in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] are represented and regulated by the [[Law Society of Ireland]]. It was formally established by Royal Charter in 1852. The legislative basis for its current role is set out in the Solicitors Acts 1954–2002.

In Ireland it is quite possible to become a solicitor without holding a law degree; a few practicing solicitors have no degree of any kind. Instead, individuals sit professional examinations which are set at degree level standard and undertake an intense apprenticeship program.

Irish independence in 1921 was marked more by continuity with the British legal system than with change. The legal profession remained divided between [[barristers]] (or ''abhcóidí'' in Irish) and solicitors (or ''aturnaetha'' in Irish). There was some blurring of the distinction between their roles over the years. Notably, under Section 17 of the Courts Act 1971, solicitors were granted a right of audience in all courts, although in practice relatively few solicitors act as advocates for their clients in the Superior Courts.

==Japan==
In Japan, {{nihongo|attorneys at law|弁護士|bengoshi|lit. "advocate"}} form the principal branch of the legal profession. ''Bengoshi'' undertake either or both advocacy work and advice or transaction work typically performed by solicitors in common law jurisdictions.

Another branch of the legal profession, [[Judicial scrivener|Shihō-shoshi]]' (司法書士), are specialists in registration procedures for real estate and incorporation. With certification by the Ministry of Justice, they are also authorized to represent clients in civil suits filed in courts of summary jurisdiction (with claimed amount up to  ¥1.4 million).<ref name="Shiho-shoshi Profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.shiho-shoshi.or.jp/html/global/english/index.html|title=Shiho-Shoshi Profile|publisher=Japan Federation of Shiho-shoshi's Associations|access-date=29 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311172514/http://www.shiho-shoshi.or.jp/html/global/english/index.html|archivedate=11 March 2016}}</ref> Although there are some parallels with modern solicitors in common law countries, "shihō-shoshi" is officially translated as "[[judicial scrivener]]", reflecting the similarity of the role with the historical role of [[scriveners]]. In 2006, their professional body, Japan Federation of Shiho-shoshi's Associations (日本司法書士会連合会) proposed that, in English, Shihō-shoshi be called "solicitor" and their organization "Japan Federation of Solicitor Associations," announcing that they would approach the government and other relevant parties to promote the use of the new translations.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=理事会レポート |trans-title=Board of Directors' Report |url=http://www.shiho-shoshi.or.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/200610_07.pdf |language=Japanese |magazine=Monthly SHIHO-SHOSHI |volume=No.416  |page=52 |year=2006 |location=Tokyo, Japan |publisher=Japan Federation of Shiho-shoshi's Associations |accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref> The government agencies, however, continue to use the traditional translation "judicial scrivener."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moj.go.jp/content/001181040.pdf|title=Ministry of Justice 2016|publisher=Ministry of Justice|page=29|access-date=29 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913123052/http://www.moj.go.jp/content/001181040.pdf|archivedate=13 September 2016}}<br>- {{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/wto/offer0507.html|title=WTO: Revised Offer (Outline)|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|access-date=29 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207083319/http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/wto/offer0507.html|archivedate=7 February 2014}}</ref> Japan Federation of Shiho-shoshi's Association itself has not (as of August 2016) officially changed its English name as proposed.<ref name="Shiho-shoshi Profile" />

==United States==
===Historical usage===
Historically, solicitors existed in the United States and, consistent with the pre-1850s usage in England and elsewhere, the term referred to a lawyer who argued cases in a [[court of equity]], as opposed to an attorney who appeared only in courts of law.<ref>[http://arcourts.ualr.edu/glossary.htm "Glossary of Terms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706115059/http://arcourts.ualr.edu/glossary.htm |date=6 July 2008 }}, ''Arkansas Territorial Briefs and Records'', William H. Bowen School of Law, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, s.v. "Chancery". Retrieved 12 June 2009.<br>- Frederic Jesup Stimpson, ''Glossary of Technical Terms, Phrases, and Maxims of the Common Law'', s.v. "Solicitors", (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1881), 273.</ref> With the chancery or equity courts disappearing or being subsumed under courts of law, by the late 19th century members of the fused profession were called "attorneys", with "solicitors" becoming obsolete.

===Modern usage===
In modern American usage, the term solicitor in the legal profession refers to government lawyers.

On the federal level, departmental solicitors remain in the Department of Labor,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/sol/|title=Office of the Solicitor (SOL) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=www.dol.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601191354/https://www.dol.gov/sol/|archivedate=1 June 2017}}</ref> Department of the Interior,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doi.gov/solicitor|title=Office of the Solicitor|website=www.doi.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513072607/https://www.doi.gov/solicitor|archivedate=13 May 2017}}</ref> and the Patent & Trademark Office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/organizational-offices/office-general-counsel/office-solicitor|title=Office of the Solicitor|first=Office of General|last=Counsel|website=uspto.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612051545/https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/organizational-offices/office-general-counsel/office-solicitor|archivedate=12 June 2017}}</ref> The [[Solicitor General of the United States]] is the lawyer appointed to represent the federal government before the [[United States Supreme Court]].

In various states, the title "solicitor" is still used by town, city, and county lawyers.  These states include Delaware,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://attorneygeneral.delaware.gov/civil/|title=Civil - Attorney General, Matt Denn - State of Delaware|website=delaware.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602040152/http://attorneygeneral.delaware.gov/civil/|archivedate=2 June 2017}}</ref> Georgia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.augustaga.gov/816/State-Court-Solicitor|title=State Court Solicitor - Augusta, GA - Official Website|website=www.augustaga.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710124901/http://augustaga.gov/816/State-Court-Solicitor|archivedate=10 July 2017}}</ref> Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and West Virginia.

In [[South Carolina]], a "solicitor" is a government attorney, while "circuit solicitor" is analogous to that of [[prosecutor]] or [[District Attorney]] in other jurisdictions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dilloncounty.sc.gov/Departments/solictor/Pages/default.aspx|title=Home|website=dilloncounty.sc.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612225700/http://dilloncounty.sc.gov/Departments/solictor/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=12 June 2017}}</ref>

In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the professional organization for government lawyers was formerly known as the City Solicitors and Town Counsel Association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massmunilaw.org|title=Massachusetts Municipal Lawyers Association – The Bar Association of Massachusetts Municipal Attorneys|website=www.massmunilaw.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106142755/http://www.massmunilaw.org/|archivedate=6 November 2017}}</ref>

===Common meaning of solicitor===
In the US, "solicitor" is also used to describe a traveling [[salesman]] (with a pejorative connotation roughly equivalent to the British English word [[tout]]) as in the signed warning on public places of accommodation, "No Soliciting". Signs bearing the phrase "No Soliciting" may appear near entrances to private residences in the US. In addition to warding off salesmen, these signs are also used to deter proselytizing by religious groups such as [[Mormons]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] with a history of door-to-door [[canvassing]] in the US.
