'''Letters patent''' ({{lang-la|litterae patentes}}) ([[plurale tantum|always in the plural]]) are a type of [[legal instrument]] in the form of a published written order issued by a [[monarch]], [[President (government title)|president]], or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, [[government-granted monopoly|monopoly]], title, or status to a person or [[corporation]].  Letters patent can be used for the creation of [[corporation]]s or government offices, or for granting city status or a [[heraldry|coat of arms]]. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of [[the Crown]], such as [[governor]]s and [[governor-general|governors-general]] of [[Commonwealth realm]]s, as well as appointing a [[Royal Commission]]. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. 

A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern [[intellectual property]] [[patent]] (referred to as a utility patent or [[design patent]] in [[United States patent law]]) granting exclusive rights in an [[invention]] (or a design in the case of a [[design patent]]). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it both to avoid infringement and understand how to put it into practical use. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Austrian Empire]], and [[Austria-Hungary]], imperial patent was also the highest form of generally binding legal regulations, e.g. [[Patent of Toleration]], [[Serfdom Patent (1781)|Serfdom Patent]] etc.

The opposite of letters patent are ''[[letters close]]'' ({{lang-la|litterae clausae}}), which are personal in nature and sealed so that only the recipient can read their contents. Letters patent are thus comparable to other kinds of [[open letter]] in that their audience is wide. It is not clear how the contents of letters patent became widely published before collection by the addressee, for example whether they were left after sealing by the king for inspection during a certain period by courtiers in a royal palace, who would disseminate the contents back to the gentry in the shires through normal conversation and social intercourse. Today, for example, it is a convention for the British prime minister to announce that they have left a document they wish to enter the public domain "in the library of the House of Commons", where it may be freely perused by all members of parliament.

==Meaning==
Letters patent are so named from the Latin verb ''{{lang|la|pateo}}'', to lie open, exposed, accessible.<ref>''Cassell's Latin Dictionary'', revised by Marchant & Charles, 260th. thousand</ref> The originator's [[seal (emblem)|seal]] was attached ''[[seal (emblem)#Sealing practices|pendent]]'' from the document, so that it did not have to be broken in order for the document to be read.

They are called "letters" (plural) from their Latin name ''{{lang|la|litterae patentes}}'', used by medieval and later scribes when the documents were written in Latin. This loanword preserves the collective plural "letters" (''litterae'') that the Latin language uses to denote a message as opposed to a single alphabet letter (''littera'').<ref>''Cassell's Latin Dictionary'', revised by Marchant & Charles, 260th. thousand: "Literae, Plur: that which is written; Cicero: ''Dare alicui literas'' (plur) ''ad aliquem'': to give to a messenger a letter for a third person"</ref>

==Usage==
Letters patent are a form of open or public proclamation<ref>E.g. document dated 13 July 1527 issued ''Teste Rege'' titled: "A Proclamation for establishing of trade and merchandizing and traffique within the towne and marches of Callice with divers immunities and freedoms concerning the same", which is self-referenced  in the document by the phrase "by theis his lettres patentes of proclamacion" [[John Gough Nichols|Nichols, John Gough]]. [https://archive.org/stream/chronicleofcalai00turprich/chronicleofcalai00turprich_djvu.txt ''The Chronicle of Calais from the Reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII to the year 1540'', London, 1846] p.102</ref> and a vestigial exercise of extra-parliamentary power by a monarch or president. Prior to the establishment of Parliament, the monarch ruled absolutely by the issuing of his personal written orders, open or closed.

They can thus be contrasted with the [[Act of Parliament]], which is in effect a written order by Parliament involving [[Royal Assent|assent]] by the monarch in conjunction with its members. No explicit government approval is contained within letters patent, only the seal or signature of the monarch.

Parliament today tolerates only a very narrow exercise of the royal prerogative by issuance of letters patent, and such documents are issued with prior informal government approval, or indeed are now generated by government itself with the monarch's seal affixed as a mere formality. In their original form they were simply written instructions or orders from the sovereign, whose order was law, which were made public to reinforce their effect.

For the sake of good governance, it is of little use if the sovereign appoints a person to a position of authority but does not at the same time inform those over whom such authority is to be exercised of the validity of the appointment.

According to the United Kingdom [[Ministry of Justice]], there are 92 different types of letters patent.<ref name="what_">{{Cite web | title = Letter from Sarah Whiteside to Steve Elibank regarding Freedom of Information Request | work = whatdotheyknow.com | date = 28 May 2012 | accessdate = 2018-08-16 | url = https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/108336/response/284995/attach/html/3/FOI%2076096%20Elibank.doc.html }}</ref> The [[Patent Rolls]] are made up of office copies of English (and later United Kingdom) royal letters patent, which run in an almost unbroken series from 1201 to the present day, with most of those to 1625 having been published.

==Form of British letters patent creating peers==
The form of letters patent for creating peerages has been fixed by the Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992 (SI 1992/1730). Part III of the schedule lays down nine ''[[pro forma]]'' texts for creating various ranks of the peerage, lords of appeal in ordinary, and baronets.

The following table organises the text from the letters patent by columns for each rank, with common text spanning multiple columns, depicting some of the similarities and differences among the proclamations.  Gender-specific differences are highlighted in italics.

The words "may have hold and possess" to "his heirs male aforesaid successively" and "have heretofore used and enjoyed or as they" (shown in brackets above) were deleted for Dukes and Duchesses, Marquesses and Marchionesses, Earls and Countesses, Viscounts, and hereditary Barons by the Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) (Amendment) Order 2000.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/3064/contents/made Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules)(Amendment) Order 2000.]</ref>

==Commonwealth realms==
In [[Commonwealth realm]]s, letters patent are issued under the prerogative powers of the head of state, as an executive or [[royal prerogative]]. They are a rare, though significant, form of [[legislation]]{{dubious|that term appears to run contrary to an “executive or royal prerogative”|date=November 2020}} which does not require the consent of [[parliament]]. Letters patent may also be used to grant [[royal assent]] to legislation.

==In the United States==
[[File:US General Land Office Deed 1845.jpg|thumb|Letters patent issued by the United States [[General Land Office]]]]

The primary source of letters patent in the [[United States]] are [[intellectual property]] [[patent]]s and [[land patent]]s, though letters patent are issued for a variety of other purposes. They function dually as public records and personal certificates.

In the United States, the [[forgery]] of letters patent granted by the [[President of the United States|President]] is a [[crime]] subject to fine, [[imprisonment]] up to ten years or both ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|497}}). Without letters patent, a person is unable to assume an appointed office. Such an issue prompted the ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' suit, where [[William Marbury]] and three others petitioned the [[United States Supreme Court]] to order [[James Madison]] to deliver their letters for appointments made under the previous administration.

===Form of United States letters patent===
United States letters patent generally do not fit a specific form, except for the [[eschatocol]], or formal ending:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, the undersigned [public official], in accordance with [relevant law], has in the name of the United States, Caused these letters to be made Patent and the Seal of [relevant agency or government official] to be hereunto affixed.
