Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by [[mitosis]] produces a [[primary tumor|primary]] [[tumour heterogeneity|heterogeneic tumour]]. The cells which constitute the tumor eventually undergo [[metaplasia]], followed by [[dysplasia]] then [[anaplasia]], resulting in a [[Malignancy|malignant]] phenotype. This malignancy allows for invasion into the circulation, followed by invasion to a second site for [[tumorigenesis]].

Some cancer cells known as [[circulating tumor cell]]s acquire the ability to penetrate the walls of [[lymphatic vessel|lymphatic]] or [[blood vessel]]s, after which they are able to circulate through the bloodstream to other sites and tissues in the body.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2010-02-01|title=Circulating tumor cells: a window into cancer biology and metastasis|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics & Development|volume=20|issue=1|pages=96–99|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2009.12.002|pmid=20071161|issn=0959-437X|pmc=2846729|last1=Maheswaran|first1=Shyamala|last2=Haber|first2=Daniel A.}}</ref> This process is known (respectively) as ''lymphatic'' or ''hematogenous'' spread.

When tumor cells metastasize, the new tumor is called a ''secondary'' or ''metastatic'' tumor, and its cells are similar to those in the original or [[primary tumor]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://drfelipeades.com/2018/07/24/o-que-e-a-metastase/|title=O que é a metástase? |date=2018-07-24 |publisher=Dr. Felipe Ades MD PhD—Oncologista|access-date=2018-10-23|language=pt-BR}}</ref> This means that if [[breast cancer]] metastasizes to the lungs, the secondary tumor is made up of abnormal breast cells, not of abnormal lung cells. The tumor in the lung is then called ''metastatic breast cancer'', not ''lung cancer''.  Metastasis is a key element in [[cancer staging]] systems such as the [[TNM staging system]], where it represents the "M".  In [[Cancer staging#Overall stage grouping|overall stage grouping]], metastasis places a cancer in Stage IV.  The possibilities of curative treatment are greatly reduced, or often entirely removed when a cancer has metastasized.

Some patients, however, do not show any symptoms.<ref name=nci/>
When the organ gets a metastatic disease it begins to shrink until its [[lymph nodes]] burst, or undergo [[lysis]].

== Pathophysiology ==
Metastatic tumors are very common in the late stages of cancer. The spread of metastasis may occur via the blood or the lymphatics or through both routes. The most common sites of metastases are the [[lung]]s, [[liver]], [[brain]], and the [[bone]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/metastatic|title=Metastatic Cancer: Questions and Answers|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=National Cancer Institute}}</ref>

Currently, three main theories have been proposed to explain the metastatic pathway of cancer: the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) hypothesis (1), the cancer stem cell hypothesis (2), and the macrophage–cancer cell fusion hybrid hypothesis (3). Some new hypotheses were suggested as well, i.e., under the effect of particular biochemical and/or physical stressors, cancer cells can undergo nuclear expulsion with subsequent macrophage engulfment and fusion, with the formation of cancer fusion cells (CFCs). <ref>Olteanu G-E, Mihai I-M, Bojin F, Gavriliuc O, Paunescu V.

=== Factors involved ===
Metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream, via the lymphatic system, or by direct extension. To do so, malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade [[protein]]s that make up the surrounding [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM), which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues. By degrading these proteins, cancer cells are able to breach the ECM and escape. The location of the metastases is not always random, with different types of cancer tending to spread to particular organs and tissues at a rate that is higher than expected by statistical chance alone.<ref name="Nguyen_2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen DX, Massagué J | title = Genetic determinants of cancer metastasis | journal = Nature Reviews.

Human cells exhibit different kinds of motion: collective [[motility]], [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal]]-type movement, and [[amoeboid movement]]. Cancer cells often opportunistically switch between different kinds of motion. Some cancer researchers hope to find treatments that can stop or at least slow down the spread of cancer by somehow blocking some necessary step in one or more kinds of motion.<ref>

All steps of the metastatic cascade involve a number of physical processes. Cell migration requires the generation of forces, and when cancer cells transmigrate through the vasculature, this requires physical gaps in the blood vessels to form.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Escribano J, Chen MB, Moeendarbary E, Cao X, Shenoy V, Garcia-Aznar JM, Kamm RD, Spill F | display-authors = 6 | title = Balance of mechanical forces drives endothelial gap formation and may facilitate cancer and immune-cell extravasation | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = e1006395 | date = May 2019 | pmid = 31048903 | pmc = 6497229 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006395 }}</ref> Besides forces, the regulation of various types of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions is crucial during metastasis.

Endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor vasculature suggests that this cell type in blood-vessel development is important in a tumor setting and metastasis. Furthermore, ablation of the endothelial progenitor cells in the bone marrow can lead to a significant decrease in tumor growth and vasculature development.

A recent study shows that PKC-iota promotes melanoma cell invasion by activating Vimentin during EMT. PKC-iota inhibition or knockdown resulted in an increase in E-cadherin and RhoA levels while decreasing total Vimentin, phosphorylated Vimentin (S39) and Par6 in metastatic melanoma cells. These results suggested that PKC-ι is involved in signaling pathways which upregulate EMT in melanoma thereby directly stimulates metastasis.<ref name="pmid29048609">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ratnayake WS, Apostolatos AH, Ostrov DA, Acevedo-Duncan M | title = Two novel atypical PKC inhibitors; ACPD and DNDA effectively mitigate cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition of metastatic melanoma while inducing apoptosis | journal = International Journal of Oncology | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 1370–1382 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29048609 | pmc = 5642393 | doi = 10.3892/ijo.2017.4131 }}</ref>

Recently, a series of high-profile experiments suggests that the co-option of intercellular cross-talk mediated by exosome vesicles is a critical factor involved in all steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade.<ref name=":0" />

=== Routes ===
Metastasis occurs by the following four routes:

==== Transcoelomic ====

The spread of a malignancy into body cavities can occur via penetrating the surface of the [[peritoneal cavity|peritoneal]], [[pleural cavity|pleural]], pericardial, or subarachnoid spaces. For example, [[ovarian cancer|ovarian tumors]] can spread transperitoneally to the surface of the liver.

==== Lymphatic spread ====

Lymphatic spread allows the transport of tumor cells to regional [[lymph node]]s near the primary tumor and ultimately, to other parts of the body. This is called nodal involvement, positive nodes, or regional disease. "Positive nodes" is a term that would be used by medical specialists to describe regional lymph nodes that tested positive for malignancy. It is common medical practice to test by biopsy at least one lymph node near a tumor site when carrying out surgery to examine or remove a tumor. This lymph node is then called a [[sentinel lymph node]].
Lymphatic spread is the most common route of initial metastasis for [[carcinoma]]s.<ref name="Robbins"/> In contrast, it is uncommon for a [[sarcoma]] to metastasize via this route. Localized spread to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor is not normally counted as a metastasis, although this is a sign of a worse [[prognosis|outcome]]. 
The lymphatic system does eventually drain from the [[thoracic duct]] and [[right lymphatic duct]] into the systemic venous system at the [[venous angle]] and into the [[brachiocephalic vein]]s, and therefore these metastatic cells can also eventually spread through the haematogenous route.

[[File:Lymph node with metastatic melanoma.jpg|thumb|Lymph node with almost complete replacement by metastatic melanoma. The brown pigment is focal deposition of melanin]]

==== Hematogenous spread ====

This is typical route of metastasis for sarcomas, but it is also the favored route for certain types of carcinoma, such as [[renal cell carcinoma]] originating in the [[kidney]]. Because of their thinner walls, veins are more frequently invaded than are arteries, and metastasis tends to follow the pattern of [[venous blood|venous flow]]. That is, hematogenous spread often follows distinct patterns depending on the location of the primary tumor. For example, [[colorectal cancer]] spreads primarily through the [[portal vein]] to the liver.

==== Canalicular spread ====

Some tumors, especially [[carcinoma]]s may metastasize along anatomical canalicular spaces. These spaces include for example the bile ducts, the urinary system, the airways and the [[subarachnoid space]]. The process is similar to that of transcoelomic spread. However, often it remains unclear whether simultaneously diagnosed tumors of a canalicular system are one metastatic process or in fact independent tumors caused by the same agent ([[field cancerization]]).

===Organ-specific targets===
[[File:Metastasis sites for common cancers.svg|thumb|240px|Main sites of metastases for some common cancer types. Primary cancers are denoted by "''...cancer''" and their main metastasis sites are denoted by "''...metastases''".<ref>List of included entries and references is found on main image page in Commons: [[Commons:File:Metastasis sites for common cancers.svg#Summary]]</ref>]]
There is a propensity for certain tumors to seed in particular organs. This was first discussed as the "seed and soil" theory by [[Stephen Paget]] in 1889. The propensity for a metastatic cell to spread to a particular organ is termed 'organotropism'. For example, [[prostate cancer]] usually metastasizes to the bones. In a similar manner, [[colon cancer]] has a tendency to metastasize to the liver. [[Stomach cancer]] often metastasises to the [[ovary]] in women, when it is called a [[Krukenberg tumor]].

According to the "seed and soil" theory, it is difficult for cancer cells to survive outside their region of origin, so in order to metastasize they must find a location with similar characteristics.<ref name="Hart_1982">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hart IR | title = 'Seed and soil' revisited: mechanisms of site-specific metastasis | journal = Cancer Metastasis Reviews | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–16 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6764375 | doi = 10.1007/BF00049477 | s2cid = 19573769 }}</ref> For example, breast tumor cells, which gather calcium [[ion]]s from breast milk, metastasize to bone tissue, where they can gather calcium ions from bone. Malignant [[melanoma]] spreads to the brain, presumably because [[neural]] tissue and [[melanocyte]]s arise from the same [[cell line]] in the [[embryo]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Weinberg | first1 = Robert A. | name-list-style = vanc | title = The Biology of Cancer | date = 2007 | publisher = Taylor & Francis | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8153-4076-8 }} quoted in {{cite news | first = Natalie | last = Angier | name-list-style = vanc | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/health/03angi.html | title = Basics: A mutinous group of cells on a greedy, destructive task | work = New York Times | date = 3 April 2007}}</ref>

In 1928, [[James Ewing (pathologist)|James Ewing]] challenged the "seed and soil" theory and proposed that metastasis occurs purely by anatomic and mechanical routes.  This hypothesis has been recently utilized to suggest several hypotheses about the life cycle of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and to postulate that the patterns of spread could be better understood through a 'filter and flow' perspective.<ref name="filterflow">{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott J, Kuhn P, Anderson AR | title = Unifying metastasis--integrating intravasation, circulation and end-organ colonization | journal = Nature Reviews.

=== Metastasis and primary cancer ===
It is theorized that metastasis always coincides with a primary cancer, and, as such, is a tumor that started from a cancer cell or cells in another part of the body. However, over 10% of patients presenting to [[oncology unit]]s will have metastases without a primary tumor found. In these cases, doctors refer to the primary tumor as "unknown" or "occult," and the patient is said to have [[cancer of unknown primary origin]] (CUP) or [[unknown primary tumors]] (UPT).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ettinger DS, Agulnik M, Cates JM, Cristea M, Denlinger CS, Eaton KD, Fidias PM, Gierada D, Gockerman JP, Handorf CR, Iyer R, Lenzi R, Phay J, Rashid A, Saltz L, Shulman LN, Smerage JB, Varadhachary GR, Zager JS, Zhen WK | display-authors = 6 | title = NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines Occult primary | journal = Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = 1358–95 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22157556 | doi = 10.6004/jnccn.2011.0117 | doi-access = free }}</ref> It is estimated that 3% of all cancers are of unknown primary origin.<ref name="CUP-Oncologist">{{cite journal | vauthors = Briasoulis E, Pavlidis N | title = Cancer of Unknown Primary Origin | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 142–152 | year = 1997 | pmid = 10388044 | doi =  10.1634/theoncologist.2-3-142| url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10388044 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Studies have shown that, if simple questioning does not reveal the cancer's source (coughing up blood—"probably [[lung cancer|lung]]", urinating blood—"probably [[bladder cancer|bladder]]"), complex imaging will not either.<ref name="CUP-Oncologist"/> In some of these cases a primary tumor may appear later.

The use of [[immunohistochemistry]] has permitted pathologists to give an identity to many of these metastases. However, imaging of the indicated area only occasionally reveals a primary.  In rare cases (e.g., of [[melanoma]]), no primary tumor is found, even on [[autopsy]]. It is therefore thought that some primary tumors can regress completely, but leave their metastases behind. In other cases, the tumor might just be too small and/or in an unusual location to be diagnosed.

== Diagnosis==
[[File:Pulmonary metastases shown on Chest X-Ray .jpg|thumb|Pulmonary metastases shown on Chest X-Ray ]]
The cells in a metastatic tumor resemble those in the primary tumor. Once the cancerous tissue is examined under a microscope to determine the cell type, a doctor can usually tell whether that type of cell is normally found in the part of the body from which the tissue sample was taken.

For instance, [[breast cancer]] cells look the same whether they are found in the breast or have spread to another part of the body. So, if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung contains cells that look like breast cells, the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor. Still, the determination of the primary tumor can often be very difficult, and the pathologist may have to use several adjuvant techniques, such as [[immunohistochemistry]], FISH ([[fluorescent in situ hybridization]]), and others. Despite the use of techniques, in some cases the primary tumor remains unidentified.

Metastatic cancers may be found at the same time as the primary tumor, or months or years later. When a second tumor is found in a patient that has been treated for cancer in the past, it is more often a metastasis than another primary tumor.

It was previously thought that most cancer cells have a low metastatic potential and that there are rare cells that develop the ability to metastasize through the development of somatic mutations.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Poste G, Fidler IJ | title = The pathogenesis of cancer metastasis | journal = Nature | volume = 283 | issue = 5743 | pages = 139–46 | date = January 1980 | pmid = 6985715 | doi = 10.1038/283139a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.283..139P | citeseerx = 10.1.1.553.5472 | s2cid = 4302076 }}</ref>  According to this theory, diagnosis of metastatic cancers is only possible after the event of metastasis.  Traditional means of diagnosing cancer (e.g. a [[biopsy]]) would only investigate a subpopulation of the cancer cells and would very likely not sample from the subpopulation with metastatic potential.<ref name="signature">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramaswamy S, Ross KN, Lander ES, Golub TR | title = A molecular signature of metastasis in primary solid tumors | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–54 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12469122 | doi = 10.1038/ng1060 | s2cid = 12059602 }}</ref>

The [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] mutation theory of metastasis development has not been substantiated in human cancers.  Rather, it seems that the genetic state of the primary tumor reflects the ability of that cancer to metastasize.<ref name=signature />  Research comparing gene expression between primary and metastatic [[adenocarcinomas]] identified a subset of genes whose expression could distinguish primary tumors from metastatic tumors, dubbed a "metastatic signature."<ref name=signature />  Up-regulated genes in the signature include:  [[SNRPF]], [[HNRPAB]], [[DHPS]] and [[securin]].  [[Actin]], [[myosin]] and [[MHC class II]] down-regulation was also associated with the signature.  Additionally, the metastatic-associated expression of these genes was also observed in some primary tumors, indicating that cells with the potential to metastasize could be identified concurrently with diagnosis of the primary tumor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van 't Veer LJ, Dai H, van de Vijver MJ, He YD, Hart AA, Mao M, Peterse HL, van der Kooy K, Marton MJ, Witteveen AT, Schreiber GJ, Kerkhoven RM, Roberts C, Linsley PS, Bernards R, Friend SH | display-authors = 6 | title = Gene expression profiling predicts clinical outcome of breast cancer | journal = Nature | volume = 415 | issue = 6871 | pages = 530–6 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11823860 | doi = 10.1038/415530a | author1link = Laura J. van't Veer | hdl = 1874/15552 | s2cid = 4369266 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> Recent work identified a form of genetic instability in cancer called [[chromosome instability]] (CIN) as a driver of metastasis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bakhoum SF, Ngo B, Laughney AM, Cavallo JA, Murphy CJ, Ly P, Shah P, Sriram RK, Watkins TB, Taunk NK, Duran M, Pauli C, Shaw C, Chadalavada K, Rajasekhar VK, Genovese G, Venkatesan S, Birkbak NJ, McGranahan N, Lundquist M, LaPlant Q, Healey JH, Elemento O, Chung CH, Lee NY, Imielenski M, Nanjangud G, Pe'er D, Cleveland DW, Powell SN, Lammerding J, Swanton C, Cantley LC | display-authors = 6 | title = Chromosomal instability drives metastasis through a cytosolic DNA response | journal = Nature | volume = 553 | issue = 7689 | pages = 467–472 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29342134 | pmc = 5785464 | doi = 10.1038/nature25432 | bibcode = 2018Natur.553..467B }}</ref> In aggressive cancer cells, loose DNA fragments from unstable chromosomes spill in the cytosol leading to the chronic activation of innate immune pathways, which are hijacked by cancer cells to spread to distant organs.

Expression of this metastatic signature has been correlated with a poor prognosis and has been shown to be consistent in several types of cancer.  Prognosis was shown to be worse for individuals whose primary tumors expressed the metastatic signature.<ref name=signature />  Additionally, the expression of these metastatic-associated genes was shown to apply to other cancer types in addition to [[adenocarcinoma]].  Metastases of [[breast cancer]], [[medulloblastoma]] and [[prostate cancer]] all had similar expression patterns of these metastasis-associated genes.<ref name=signature />

The identification of this metastasis-associated signature provides promise for identifying cells with metastatic potential within the primary tumor and hope for improving the prognosis of these metastatic-associated cancers.  Additionally, identifying the genes whose expression is changed in metastasis offers potential targets to inhibit metastasis.<ref name=signature />

== Management ==
Treatment and survival is determined, to a great extent, by whether or not a cancer remains localized or spreads to other locations in the body. If the cancer metastasizes to other tissues or organs it usually dramatically increases a patient's likelihood of death. Some cancers—such as some forms of [[leukemia]], a cancer of the blood, or [[Brain tumor|malignancies in the brain]]—can kill without spreading at all.

Once a cancer has metastasized it may still be treated with [[radiosurgery]], [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], [[biological therapy]], [[hormone therapy]], [[surgery]], or a combination of these interventions ("multimodal therapy"). The choice of treatment depends on many factors, including the type of primary [[cancer]], the size and location of the metastases, the patient's age and general health, and the types of treatments used previously. In patients diagnosed with CUP it is often still possible to treat the disease even when the primary tumor cannot be located.

Current treatments are rarely able to cure metastatic cancer though some tumors, such as [[testicular cancer]] and [[thyroid cancer]], are usually curable.

[[Palliative care]], care aimed at improving the quality of life of people with major illness, has been recommended as part of management programs for metastasis.<ref name="Irwin_2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Irwin KE, Greer JA, Khatib J, Temel JS, Pirl WF | title = Early palliative care and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: potential mechanisms of prolonged survival | journal = Chronic Respiratory Disease | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–47 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23355404 | doi = 10.1177/1479972312471549 | s2cid = 6743524 }}</ref>

==Research==
Although metastasis is widely accepted to be the result of the tumor cells migration, there is a [[hypothesis]] saying that some metastases are the result of inflammatory processes by abnormal immune cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shahriyari L | title = A new hypothesis: some metastases are the result of inflammatory processes by adapted cells, especially adapted immune cells at sites of inflammation | journal = F1000Research | volume = 5 | pages = 175 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27158448 | pmc = 4847566 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.8055.1 }}</ref>  The existence of metastatic cancers in the absence of primary tumors also suggests that metastasis is not always caused by malignant cells that leave primary tumors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = López-Lázaro M | title = The migration ability of stem cells can explain the existence of cancer of unknown primary site.

==History==
In March 2014 researchers discovered the oldest complete example of a human with metastatic cancer. The tumors had developed in a 3,000-year-old skeleton found in 2013 in a tomb in [[Sudan]] dating back to 1200 BC. The skeleton was analyzed using radiography and a scanning electron microscope. These findings were published in the ''[[Public Library of Science]]'' journal.<ref name=Kelland-cancer>{{cite news|last=Kelland|first=Kate | name-list-style = vanc |title=Archaeologists discover earliest example of human with cancer|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/17/us-cancer-ancient-idUSBREA2G1BL20140317|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=17 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=Ghosh-cancer>{{cite news|last=Ghosh|first=Pallab| name-list-style = vanc |title=Ancient skeleton is the earliest case of cancer yet detected|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26627941|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=BBC|date=18 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=Ross-cancer>{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Philip| name-list-style = vanc |title=Possible Oldest Cancer Found In 3,000-Year-Old Skeleton Could Reveal 'Evolution' Of Modern Disease|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/possible-oldest-cancer-found-3000-year-old-skeleton-could-reveal-evolution-modern-disease-1561953|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=International Business Times|date=17 March 2014}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Metastasis is a [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word meaning "displacement", from μετά, ''meta'', "next", and στάσις, ''stasis'', "placement".
