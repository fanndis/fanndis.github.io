{{Politics of the Republic of China}}

The '''Kuomintang''' ('''KMT''') ({{zh |t = 中國國民黨 |p = Zhōngguó Guómíndǎng |l = China Nationals’ Party }}), often referred to in English as the '''Nationalist Party of China''' or '''Chinese Nationalist Party''' ('''CNP'''), is a major political party in [[Taiwan]], based in the city of [[Taipei]]. Formed in 1919, the KMT was the [[Dominant-party system|sole ruling party]] of the Republic of China from 1928 to 2000 under the ''[[Dang Guo]]'' system, and is currently an opposition political party in the [[Legislative Yuan]]. The Kuomintang is one of the [[History of political parties in China|two historical contemporary parties in China]], the other being the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP).

The predecessor of the Kuomintang, the Revolutionary Alliance ([[Tongmenghui]]), was one of the major advocates of the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty]], the subsequent revolt in 1911, and the proclamation of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. The KMT was founded by [[Song Jiaoren]] and [[Sun Yat-sen]] shortly after the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911. Sun was the [[President of the Republic of China|provisional President]], but he ceded the presidency to [[Yuan Shikai]]. Yuan's death in 1916 led to the nation's disintegration in the [[Warlord Era]]. Sun deputed [[Chiang Kai-shek]] to form the [[National Revolutionary Army]] and launch the [[Northern Expedition]] that [[Chinese reunification (1928)|unified]] much of [[China proper|mainland China]] and established the capital at Nanjing. During the subsequent [[Nanjing decade]], China achieved substantial economic growth and social progress, but the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945) was disastrous. After the loss of the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1945–1949) to the [[Communist Party of China]]  the KMT retreated to Taiwan where it continued to govern as an authoritarian [[one-party state]]. The Nationalist government retained [[China and the United Nations|China's United Nations seat]] until 1971.

Taiwan ceased to be a single-party state in 1986 under President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], Chiang Kai-shek's son, and political reforms beginning in the 1990s under President [[Lee Teng-hui]] loosened the KMT's grip on power. Nevertheless, the KMT remains one of Taiwan's main political parties, with [[Ma Ying-jeou]], [[2008 Taiwan presidential election|elected in 2008]] and [[2012 Taiwan presidential election|re-elected in 2012]], being the seventh KMT member to hold the office of the presidency. In the [[2016 Taiwan general election|2016 general]] and [[2016 Taiwan presidential election|presidential election]], the KMT was defeated in both elections as the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) gained control of both the Legislative Yuan and the presidency, with [[Tsai Ing-wen]] being elected president.

The party's guiding ideology is the [[Three Principles of the People]], advocated by Sun Yat-sen. The KMT is a member of the [[International Democrat Union]]. Together with the [[People First Party (Taiwan)|People First Party]] and [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party]], the KMT forms what is known as the Taiwanese [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] which supports eventual [[Chinese unification|unification with the mainland]]. However, the KMT has been forced to moderate its stance by advocating the [[political status of Taiwan|political]] and legal ''status quo'' of modern Taiwan as political realities make the reunification of China unlikely. The KMT holds to the [[one-China policy]] in that it officially considers that there is only one China, but that the Republic of China rather than the [[China|People's Republic of China]] is its legitimate government under the [[1992 Consensus]]. To ease tensions with the PRC, the KMT has since 2008 endorsed the [[Three Noes]] policy as defined by Ma Ying-jeou, namely no unification, no independence and no use of force.<ref>{{cite news |title=Looking behind Ma's 'three noes' |author=Ralph Cossa |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2008/01/21/2003398185 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=21 January 2008 |access-date=15 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607040233/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2008/01/21/2003398185 |archive-date=7 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Dr. Sun in London.jpg|thumb|upright|The KMT reveres its founder, [[Sun Yat-sen]], as the "Father of the Nation"]]
The KMT traces its ideological and organizational roots to the work of [[Sun Yat-sen]], a proponent of [[Chinese nationalism]] and democracy who founded [[Revive China Society]] at the capital of the [[Republic of Hawaii]], [[Honolulu]] on 24 November 1894.<ref>See (Chinese) [http://www.kmt.org.tw/hc.aspx?id=10 "Major Events in KMT" ''History Official Site of the KMT''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126201029/http://www.kmt.org.tw/hc.aspx?id=10 |date=26 November 2012 }} last accessed 30 August 2009</ref> In 1905, Sun joined forces with other [[Anti-Qing sentiment|anti-monarchist societies]] in Tokyo, [[Empire of Japan]] to form the [[Tongmenghui]] on 20 August 1905, a group committed to the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the establishment of a republic style government.

The group planned and supported the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] on 1 January 1912. However, Sun did not have military power and ceded the [[President of the Republic of China|provisional presidency]] of the republic to [[Yuan Shikai]], who arranged for the [[abdication]] of [[Puyi]], the last Emperor, on 12 February.

On 25 August 1912, the Nationalist Party was established at the [[Huguang Guild Hall]] in [[Beijing|Peking]], where [[Tongmenghui]] and five smaller pro-revolution parties merged to contest the first national elections.<ref>{{cite book |last=Strand |first=David |editor1-last=Goldman |editor1-first=Merle |editor2-last=Perry |editor2-first=Elizabeth |editor2-link = Elizabeth J.

The most influential member of the party was the third ranking [[Song Jiaoren]], who mobilized mass support from gentry and merchants for the Nationalists to advocate a constitutional parliamentary democracy. The party opposed [[Progressive Party (China)|constitutional monarchists]] and sought to check the power of Yuan. The Nationalists won an overwhelming majority of the first [[1912 Republic of China National Assembly election|National Assembly election]] in December 1912.

However, Yuan soon began to ignore the parliament in making presidential decisions. Song Jiaoren was assassinated in Shanghai in 1913. Members of the Nationalists led by Sun Yat-sen suspected that Yuan was behind the plot and thus staged the [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] in July 1913, a poorly planned and ill-supported armed rising to overthrow Yuan, and failed. Yuan, claiming subversiveness and betrayal, expelled adherents of the KMT from the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|parliament]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Hugh Chisholm |title=The Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAooAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA658 |access-date=13 June 2011 |year=1922 |publisher=The Encyclopædia Britannica, Company ltd. |page=658 |editor=Hugh Chisholm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205085023/https://books.google.com/books?id=bAooAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA658 |archive-date=5 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: Abbe to English history ("The first of the new volumes")|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lf9aAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA658|access-date=13 June 2011|year=1922|publisher=The Encyclopædia Britannica, Company ltd|page=658|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205024143/https://books.google.com/books?id=lf9aAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA658|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Yuan dissolved the Nationalists in November (whose members had largely fled into exile in Japan) and dismissed the parliament early in 1914.

[[Yuan Shikai]] proclaimed himself emperor in December 1915. While exiled in Japan in 1914, Sun established the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] on 8 July 1914, but many of his old revolutionary comrades, including Huang Xing, [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Hu Hanmin]] and [[Chen Jiongming]], refused to join him or support his efforts in inciting armed uprising against Yuan. To join the Revolutionary Party, members had to take an oath of personal loyalty to Sun, which many old revolutionaries regarded as undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the revolution. As a result, he became largely sidelined within the Republican movement during this period.

Sun returned to China in 1917 to establish a military junta at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] to oppose the [[Beiyang government]] but was soon forced out of office and exiled to Shanghai. There, with renewed support, he resurrected the KMT on 10 October 1919, under the name Kuomintang of China ({{zh|t=中國國民黨|labels=no}}) and established its headquarters in Canton in 1920.

In 1923, the KMT and its Canton government accepted aid from the [[Soviet Union]] after being denied recognition by the western powers. Soviet advisers—the most prominent of whom was [[Mikhail Borodin]], an agent of the [[Comintern]]—arrived in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], establishing a [[Leninist]] party structure that lasted into the 1990s. The Communist Party of China (CPC) was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the KMT, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their separate party identities, forming the [[First United Front]] between the two parties. [[Mao Zedong]] and early members of the CPC also joined the KMT in 1923.

[[File:KMTfirstCongress1924.jpg|thumb|Venue of the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang]] in 1924]]
Soviet advisers also helped the KMT to set up a political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques, and in 1923 [[Chiang Kai-shek]], one of Sun's lieutenants from the [[Tongmenghui]] days, was sent to Moscow for several months' military and political study. At the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang|first party congress in 1924]] in [[Guangzhou|Kwangchow]], [[Kwangtung]], (Guangzhou, Guangdong) which included non-KMT delegates such as members of the CPC, they adopted Sun's political theory, which included the [[Three Principles of the People]]: nationalism, democracy and people's livelihood.

When Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, the political leadership of the KMT fell to [[Wang Jingwei]] and [[Hu Hanmin]], respectively the left-wing and right-wing leaders of the party. However, the real power was in the hands of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who was in near complete control of the military as the superintendent of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]]. With their military superiority, KMT confirmed their rule on Canton, the provincial capital of [[Kwangtung]]. The Guangxi warlords pledged loyalty to the KMT. The KMT now became a rival government in opposition to the [[Warlord era|warlord]] [[Beiyang government]] based in [[Beijing|Peking]].<ref name="Nationalist China">{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MODCHINA/NATIONAL.HTM|title=Nationalist China|publisher=Washington State University|date=6 June 1996|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906095406/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MODCHINA/NATIONAL.HTM|archive-date=6 September 2006}}</ref>

Unlike Sun Yat-sen, whom he admired greatly and who forged all his political, economic, and revolutionary ideas primarily from what he had learned in Hawaii and indirectly through [[British Hong Kong]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] under the [[Meiji Restoration]], Chiang knew relatively little about the West. He also studied in Japan, but he was firmly rooted in his ancient [[Han Chinese]] identity and was steeped in [[Chinese culture]]. As his life progressed, he became increasingly attached to ancient Chinese culture and traditions. His few trips to the West confirmed his pro-ancient Chinese outlook and he studied the ancient [[Chinese classics]] and ancient Chinese history assiduously.<ref name="Nationalist China"/> In 1923, after the formation of the [[First United Front]], Sun Yat-sen sent Chiang to spend three months in Moscow studying the political and military system of the Soviet Union. Although Chiang did not follow the Soviet [[Communist]] doctrine, he, like the Communist Party, sought to destroy [[warlordism]] and foreign [[Western imperialism in Asia|imperialism in China]], and upon his return established the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] near Guangzhou, following the Soviet Model.<ref name="China in the 20th Century">{{cite web |last1=Bowblis |first1=J |title=China in the 20th Century |url=https://departments.kings.edu/history/20c/china.html#Chiang |website=Kings College History |publisher=King's College History Department |access-date=31 Oct 2020}}</ref>

Chiang was also particularly committed to Sun's idea of "political tutelage". Sun believed that the only hope for a unified and better China lay in a military conquest, followed by a period of political tutelage that would culminate in the transition to democracy. Using this ideology, Chiang built himself into the dictator of the Republic of China, both in the [[Chinese mainland]] and after the [[Government of the Republic of China|national government]] relocated to [[Taiwan]].<ref name="Nationalist China"/>

Following the death of Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek emerged as the KMT leader and launched the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] to defeat the [[Warlord era (China)|northern warlords]] and unite China under the party. With its power confirmed in the southeast, the [[Nationalist Government]] appointed Chiang Kai-shek commander-in-chief of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA), and the [[Northern Expedition]] to suppress the warlords began. Chiang had to defeat three separate warlords and two independent armies. Chiang, with Soviet supplies, conquered the southern half of China in nine months.

A split erupted between the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and the KMT, which threatened the Northern Expedition. Wang Jing Wei, who led the KMT leftist allies, took the city of [[Wuhan]] in January 1927. With the support of the Soviet agent [[Mikhail Borodin]], Wang declared the National Government as having moved to Wuhan. Having taken Nanking in March, Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang and his communist allies. Chiang's expulsion of the CPC and their Soviet advisers, marked by the [[Shanghai massacre]] on 12 April, led to the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Wang finally surrendered his power to Chiang. [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to obey the KMT leadership.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Once this split had been healed, Chiang resumed his Northern Expedition and managed to take Shanghai.<ref name="Nationalist China"/>

During the [[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]] in March 1927, the NRA stormed the consulates of the United States, United Kingdom (UK) and [[Empire of Japan]], looted foreign properties and almost assassinated the Japanese consul.

NRA took Peking in 1928. The city was the internationally recognized capital, even when it was previously controlled by warlords. This event allowed the KMT to receive widespread diplomatic recognition in the same year. The capital was moved from Peking to Nanking, the original capital of the [[Ming dynasty]], and thus a symbolic purge of the final Qing elements. This period of KMT rule in China between 1927 and 1937 was relatively stable and prosperous and is still known as the [[Nanjing decade]].

After the [[Northern Expedition]] in 1928, the [[Nationalist government]] under the KMT declared that China had been exploited for decades under the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] signed between the foreign powers and the Qing Dynasty. The KMT government demanded that the foreign powers renegotiate the treaties on equal terms.<ref>{{cite news|title=CHINA: Nationalist Notes|work=Time|date=25 June 1928|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786420,00.html|access-date=11 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426030536/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786420,00.html|archive-date=26 April 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Before the Northern Expedition, the KMT began as a heterogeneous group advocating American-inspired federalism and provincial autonomy. However, the KMT under Chiang's leadership aimed at establishing a centralized [[one-party state]] with one ideology. This was even more evident following Sun's elevation into a cult figure after his death. The control by one single party began the period of "political tutelage", whereby the party was to lead the government while instructing the people on how to participate in a democratic system. The topic of reorganizing the army, brought up at a military conference in 1929, sparked the [[Central Plains War]]. The cliques, some of them former warlords, demanded to retain their army and political power within their own territories. Although Chiang finally won the war, the conflicts among the cliques would have a devastating effect on the survival of the KMT. Muslim Generals in [[Gansu|Kansu]] waged war against the [[Guominjun]] in favor of the KMT during the [[Muslim conflict in Gansu (1927–1930)|conflict in Gansu in 1927–1930]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Andrew D.

[[File:kmtarmy.JPG|thumb|upright|[[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist soldiers]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]]]
Although the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] officially broke out in 1937, Japanese aggression started in 1931 when they staged the [[Mukden Incident]] and occupied Manchuria. At the same time, the CPC had been secretly recruiting new members within the KMT government and military. Chiang was alarmed by the expansion of the communist influence. He believed that to fight against foreign aggression, the KMT must solve its internal conflicts first, so he started his second attempt to exterminate CPC members in 1934. With the advice from German military advisors, the KMT forced the Communists to withdraw from their bases in southern and central China into the mountains in a massive military retreat known as the [[Long March]]. Less than 10% of the communist army survived the long retreat to Shaanxi province, but they re-established their military base quickly with aid from the Soviet Union.

The KMT was also known to have used terror tactics against suspected communists, through the use of a secret police force, who were employed to maintain surveillance on suspected communists and political opponents. In ''The Birth of Communist China'', C.P. Fitzgerald describes China under the rule of the KMT thus: "the Chinese people groaned under a regime Fascist in every quality except efficiency."<ref>C.P. Fitzgerald, ''The Birth of Communist China'', Penguin Books, 1964, pp.106. ({{ISBN|978-0-14-020694-4}} / {{ISBN|978-0-14-020694-4}})</ref>

[[Zhang Xueliang]], who believed that the Japanese invasion was a greater threat, was persuaded by the CPC to take Chiang hostage during the [[Xi'an Incident]] in 1937 and forced Chiang to agree to an alliance with them in the total war against the Japanese. However, in many situations the alliance was in name only; after a brief period of cooperation, the armies began to fight the Japanese separately, rather than as coordinated allies. The [[New Fourth Army Incident]], where the KMT ambushed the New Fourth Army with overwhelming numbers and decimated it, effectively ended collaboration between the CPC and the KMT.

While the KMT army sustained heavy casualties fighting the Japanese, the CPC expanded its territory by guerrilla tactics within Japanese occupied regions, leading some{{Who|date=February 2016}} claims that the CPC often refused to support the KMT troops, choosing to withdraw and let the KMT troops take the brunt of Japanese attacks.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-ccp-didnt-fight-imperial-japan-the-kmt-did/|title=The CCP Didn't Fight Imperial Japan; the KMT Did|last=Diplomat|first=Zachary Keck|work=The Diplomat|access-date=23 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524003640/https://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-ccp-didnt-fight-imperial-japan-the-kmt-did/|archive-date=24 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:19451025 中國戰區臺灣省受降典禮後 臺灣省警備總司令部全體官兵合影.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Retrocession Day|retrocession of Taiwan]] in [[Taipei]] on 25 October 1945]]
[[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] in 1945, and [[Retrocession Day|Taiwan was returned]] to the Republic of China on 25 October of that year. The brief period of celebration was soon shadowed by the possibility of a civil war between the KMT and CPC. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan just before it surrendered and occupied [[Manchuria]], the north eastern part of China. The Soviet Union denied the KMT army the right to enter the region and allowed the CPC to take control of the Japanese factories and their supplies.

Full-scale civil war between the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and the [[Nationalist government|Nationalists]] erupted in 1946. The Communist Chinese armies, the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), previously a minor faction, grew rapidly in influence and power due to several errors on the KMT's part. First, the KMT reduced troop levels precipitously after the Japanese surrender, leaving large numbers of able-bodied, trained fighting men who became unemployed and disgruntled with the KMT as prime recruits for the PLA. Second, the KMT government proved thoroughly unable to manage the economy, allowing hyperinflation to result. Among the most despised and ineffective efforts it undertook to contain inflation was the conversion to the gold standard for the national treasury and the [[Chinese gold yuan]] in August 1948, outlawing private ownership of gold, silver and foreign exchange, collecting all such precious metals and foreign exchange from the people and issuing the Gold Standard Scrip in exchange. As most farmland in the north were under CPC's control, the cities governed by the KMT lacked food supply and this added to the hyperinflation. The new scrip became worthless in only ten months and greatly reinforced the nationwide perception of the KMT as a corrupt or at best inept entity. Third, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his forces to defend the urbanized cities. This decision gave CPC a chance to move freely through the countryside. At first, the KMT had the edge with the aid of weapons and ammunition from the United States (US). However, with the country suffering from [[hyperinflation]], widespread corruption and other economic ills, the KMT continued to lose popular support. Some leading officials and military leaders of the KMT hoarded material, armament and military-aid funding provided by the US. This became an issue which proved to be a hindrance of its relationship with [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]. US President [[Harry S. Truman]] wrote that "[[Chiang family|the Chiangs]], [[HH Kung|the Kungs]] and [[Soong sisters|the Soongs]] (were) all thieves", having taken $750&nbsp;million in US aid.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wesley Marvin Bagby|title=The Eagle-Dragon Alliance: America's Relations With China in World War II|year=1992|isbn=978-0-87413-418-6|page=65}}</ref>

At the same time, the suspension of American aid and tens of thousands of deserted or decommissioned soldiers being recruited to the PLA cause tipped the balance of power quickly to the CPC side, and the overwhelming popular support for the CPC in most of the country made it all but impossible for the KMT forces to carry out successful assaults against the Communists.

By the end of 1949, the CPC controlled almost all of [[mainland China]], as the KMT retreated to Taiwan with a significant amount of China's national treasures and 2 million people, including military forces and refugees. Some party members stayed in the mainland and broke away from the main KMT to found the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang]], which still currently exists as one of the [[list of political parties in the People's Republic of China|eight minor registered parties]] of the People's Republic of China.

In 1895, Formosa (now called Taiwan), including the [[Penghu]] islands, became a Japanese colony via the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].

After Japan's defeat at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, [[General Order No. 1]] instructed Japan to surrender its troops in Taiwan to Chiang Kai-shek. On 25 October 1945, KMT general [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] acted on behalf of the Allied Powers to accept Japan's surrender and proclaimed that day as [[Retrocession Day|Taiwan Retrocession Day]].

Tensions between the local Taiwanese and [[Mainland Chinese|mainlanders]] from Mainland China increased in the intervening years, culminating in a flashpoint on 27 February 1947 in [[Taipei]] when a dispute between a female cigarette vendor and an anti-smuggling officer in front of [[Tianma Tea House]] triggered civil disorder and protests that would last for days. The uprising turned bloody and was shortly put down by the [[Military of the Republic of China|ROC Army]] in the [[February 28 Incident]]. As a result of the 28 February Incident in 1947, Taiwanese people endured what is called the "[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]", a KMT-led political repression that resulted in the death or disappearance of over 30,000 Taiwanese intellectuals, activists, and people suspected of opposition to the KMT.<ref>[http://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/read.aspx?sno=5B33122680FD5E65A32B8E335FE5727A "Ceremonies held to commemorate 228 Incident victims (2014/02/28)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211124818/http://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/read.aspx?sno=5B33122680FD5E65A32B8E335FE5727A |date=11 December 2014 }}.

Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on 1 October 1949, the commanders of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) believed that [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] had to be taken before a final assault on Taiwan. The KMT fought the [[Battle of Guningtou]] on 25–27 October 1949 and stopped the PLA invasion. The KMT headquarter was set up on 10 December 1949 at No. 11 Zhongshan South Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=para&mnum=108|title=Party's History|publisher=Kuomintang|quote=Following the government of the Republic of China, the Kuomintang relocates to Taiwan.

The provision declared [[martial law in Taiwan]] and halted some democratic processes, including presidential and parliamentary elections, until the mainland could be recovered from the CPC. The KMT estimated it would take 3 years to defeat the Communists. The slogan was "prepare in the first year, start fighting in the second, and conquer in the third year." Chiang also initiated the [[Project National Glory]] to retake back the mainland in 1965, but was eventually dropped in July 1972 after many unsuccessful attempts.

However, various factors, including international pressure, are believed to have prevented the KMT from militarily engaging the CPC full-scale. The KMT backed Muslim insurgents formerly belonging to the [[National Revolutionary Army]] during the [[Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China (1950–58)|KMT Islamic insurgency in 1950–1958]] in Mainland China. A cold war with a couple of minor military conflicts was resulted in the early years. The various government bodies previously in [[Nanjing]], that were re-established in Taipei as the KMT-controlled government, actively claimed sovereignty over all China. The Republic of China in Taiwan retained [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the United Nations]] until 1971.

Until the 1970s, the KMT successfully pushed ahead with land reforms, developed the economy, implemented a democratic system in a lower level of the government, improved [[Cross-Strait relations|relations between Taiwan and the mainland]] and created the [[Taiwan economic miracle]]. However, the KMT controlled the government under a one-party authoritarian state until reforms in the late 1970s through the 1990s. The ROC in Taiwan was once referred to synonymously with the KMT and known simply as Nationalist China after its ruling party. In the 1970s, the KMT began to allow for "supplemental elections" in Taiwan to fill the seats of the aging representatives in the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]].

Although opposition parties were not permitted, the pro-democracy movement ''[[Tangwai]]'' ("outside the KMT") created the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) on 28 September 1986. Outside observers of Taiwanese politics expected the KMT to clamp down and crush the illegal opposition party, though this did not occur, and instead the party's formation marked the beginning of Taiwan's [[democratization]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-052318-025732|doi-access=free|title=Authoritarian-Led Democratization|year=2020|last1=Riedl|first1=Rachel Beatty|last2=Slater|first2=Dan|last3=Wong|first3=Joseph|last4=Ziblatt|first4=Daniel|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=23|pages=315–332}}</ref>

In 1991, [[martial law]] ceased when President [[Lee Teng-hui]] terminated the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]. All parties started to be allowed to compete at all levels of elections, including the presidential election. [[Lee Teng-hui]], the ROC's first democratically elected president and the leader of the KMT during the 1990s, announced his advocacy of "special state-to-state relations" with the PRC. The PRC associated this idea with [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]].

The KMT faced a split in 1993 that led to the formation of the [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party]] in August 1993, alleged to be a result of Lee's "corruptive ruling style". The New Party has, since the purging of Lee, largely reintegrated into the KMT. A much more serious split in the party occurred as a result of the [[2000 Taiwan presidential election|2000 Presidential election]]. Upset at the choice of [[Lien Chan]] as the party's presidential nominee, former party Secretary-General [[James Soong]] launched an independent bid, which resulted in the expulsion of Soong and his supporters and the formation of the [[People First Party (Taiwan)|People First Party]] (PFP) on 31 March 2000. The KMT candidate placed third behind Soong in the elections. After the election, Lee's strong relationship with the opponent became apparent. To prevent defections to the PFP, Lien moved the party away from Lee's pro-independence policies and became more favorable toward [[Chinese reunification]]. This shift led to Lee's expulsion from the party and the formation of the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] (TSU) by Lee supporters on 24 July 2001.

[[File:Pan-blue supporters during 2004 ROC presidential election with ROC flags.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pan-Blue Coalition|Pan-blue]] supporters at a rally during the [[2004 Republic of China presidential election|2004 presidential election]]]]
Prior to this, the party's voters had defected to both the PFP and TSU, and the KMT did poorly in the [[2001 Taiwan legislative election|December 2001 legislative elections]] and lost its position as the largest party in the [[Legislative Yuan]]. However, the party did well in the 2002 local government mayoral and council election with [[Ma Ying-jeou]], its candidate for Taipei mayor, winning reelection by a landslide and its candidate for [[Kaohsiung]] mayor narrowly losing but doing surprisingly well. Since 2002, the KMT and PFP have coordinated electoral strategies. In 2004, the KMT and PFP ran a joint presidential ticket, with Lien running for president and Soong running for vice-president.

The loss of the presidential election of 2004 to DPP President [[Chen Shui-bian]] by merely over 30,000 votes was a bitter disappointment to party members, leading to large scale rallies for several weeks protesting alleged electoral fraud and the "odd circumstances" of the [[3-19 shooting incident|shooting of President Chen]]. However, the fortunes of the party were greatly improved when the KMT did well in the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|legislative elections]] held in December 2004 by maintaining its support in southern Taiwan achieving a majority for the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]].

Soon after the election, there appeared to be a falling out with the KMT's junior partner, the People First Party and talk of a merger seemed to have ended. This split appeared to widen in early 2005, as the leader of the PFP, James Soong appeared to be reconciling with President [[Chen Shui-Bian]] and the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. Many PFP members including legislators and municipal leaders have defected to the KMT, and the PFP is seen as a fading party.

In 2005, Ma Ying-jeou became KMT chairman defeating speaker [[Wang Jin-pyng]] in the [[2005 Kuomintang chairmanship election|first public election for KMT chairmanship]]. The KMT won a decisive victory in the [[2005 Taiwanese local elections|3-in-1 local elections]] of December 2005, replacing the DPP as the largest party at the local level. This was seen as a major victory for the party ahead of legislative elections in 2007. There were elections for the two municipalities of the ROC, Taipei and [[Kaohsiung]] in December 2006. The KMT won a clear victory in Taipei, but lost to the DPP in the southern city of [[Kaohsiung]] by the slim margin of 1,100 votes.

On 13 February 2007, Ma was indicted by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office on charges of allegedly embezzling approximately NT$11&nbsp;million (US$339,000), regarding the issue of "special expenses" while he was mayor of Taipei. Shortly after the indictment, he submitted his resignation as KMT chairman at the same press conference at which he formally announced his candidacy for ROC President. Ma argued that it was customary for officials to use the special expense fund for personal expenses undertaken in the course of their official duties. In December 2007, Ma was acquitted of all charges and immediately filed suit against the prosecutors. In 2008, the KMT won a landslide victory in the [[2008 Taiwan presidential election|Republic of China Presidential Election on 22 March 2008]]. The KMT fielded former Taipei mayor and former KMT chairman [[Ma Ying-jeou]] to run against the DPP's Frank Hsieh. Ma won by a margin of 17% against Hsieh. Ma took office on 20 May 2008, with Vice-Presidential candidate Vincent Siew, and ended 8 years of the DPP presidency. The KMT also won a landslide victory in the [[2008 Taiwan legislative election|2008 legislative elections]], winning 81 of 113 seats, or 71.7% of seats in the [[Legislative Yuan]]. These two elections gave the KMT firm control of both the executive and legislative yuans.

On 25 June 2009, President Ma launched his bid to regain KMT's leadership and registered as the sole candidate for the [[2009 Kuomintang chairmanship election|election of the KMT chairmanship]]. On 26 July, Ma won 93.87% of the vote, becoming the new chairman of the KMT,<ref>[http://english.cna.com.tw/ReadNews/Detail.aspx?pSearchDate=&pNewsID=200907270004&pType1=PD&pType0=xPDCS&pTypeSel=0 President Ma elected KMT chairman]{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – CNA ENGLISH NEWS</ref> taking office on 17 October 2009. This officially allows Ma to be able to meet with [[Xi Jinping]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] and other PRC delegates, as he is able to represent the KMT as leader of a Chinese political party, rather than as head-of-state of a political entity unrecognized by the PRC.<ref>[http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=986347&lang=eng_news&cate_img=logo_taiwan&cate_rss=TAIWAN_eng Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou registers for KMT leadership race] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429035126/http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=986347&lang=eng_news&cate_img=logo_taiwan&cate_rss=TAIWAN_eng |date=29 April 2011 }} – eTaiwan News</ref>

On 29 November 2014, the KMT suffered a heavy loss in the [[2014 Taiwanese local elections|local election]] to the DPP, winning only 6 municipalities and counties, down from 14 in the previous election in [[2009 Taiwanese local elections|2009]] and [[2010 Taiwanese municipal elections|2010]]. Ma Ying-jeou subsequently resigned from the party chairmanship on 3 December and replaced by acting Chairman [[Wu Den-yih]].

As the ruling party on Taiwan, the KMT amassed a vast business empire of banks, investment companies, petrochemical firms, and television and radio stations, thought to have made it the world's richest political party, with assets once estimated to be around US$2–10&nbsp;billion.<ref name="KMT_asset">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=898158|newspaper=Economist|title=Taiwan's Kuomintang On the brink|date=6 December 2001|access-date=21 March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908041252/http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=898158|archive-date=8 September 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> Although this war chest appeared to help the KMT until the mid-1990s, it later led to accusations of corruption (often referred to as "[[Black gold (politics)|black gold]]").

After 2000, the KMT's financial holdings appeared to be more of a liability than a benefit, and the KMT started to divest itself of its assets. However, the transactions were not disclosed and the whereabouts of the money earned from selling assets (if it has gone anywhere) is unknown. There were accusations in the [[2004 Taiwan presidential election|2004 presidential election]] that the KMT retained assets that were illegally acquired. During the 2000–2008 DPP presidency, a law was proposed by the DPP in the [[Legislative Yuan]] to recover illegally acquired party assets and return them to the government. However, due to the DPP's lack of control of the legislative chamber at the time, it never materialised.

The KMT also acknowledged that part of its assets were acquired through extra-legal means and thus promised to "retro-endow" them to the government. However, the quantity of the assets which should be classified as illegal are still under heated debate. DPP, in its capacity as ruling party from 2000 to 2008, claimed that there is much more that the KMT has yet to acknowledge. Also, the KMT actively sold assets under its title to quench its recent financial difficulties, which the DPP argues is illegal. Former KMT chairman [[Ma Ying-Jeou]]'s position is that the KMT will sell some of its properties at below market rates rather than return them to the government and that the details of these transactions will not be publicly disclosed.

In 2006, the KMT sold its headquarters at 11 Zhongshan South Road in [[Taipei]] to [[Evergreen Group]] for [[New Taiwan dollar|NT$]]2.3&nbsp;billion (US$96&nbsp;million). The KMT moved into a smaller building on Bade Road in the eastern part of the city.<ref>Mo, Yan-chih.

''[[Taipei Times]]''. Thursday 23 March 2006. Page 1. Retrieved 29 September 2009.</ref>

In July 2014, the KMT reported total assets of NT$26.8&nbsp;billion (US$892.4&nbsp;million) and interest earnings of NT$981.52&nbsp;million for the year of 2013, making it one of the richest political parties in the world.<ref>2014-07-24, [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/07/24/2003595820 KMT is again ‘world’s richest party’] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726150524/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/07/24/2003595820 |date=26 July 2014 }}, Taipei Times</ref>

In August 2016, the [[Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee]] is set up by the ruling DPP government to investigate KMT party assets acquired during the [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] period and recover those that were determined to be illegally acquired.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tai|first1=Ya-chen|last2=Hsieh|first2=Chia-chen|last3=Hsu|first3=Elizabeth|title=Commission to investigate KMT assets launched|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201608310021.aspx|access-date=31 August 2016|agency=Central News Agency|date=31 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901140008/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201608310021.aspx|archive-date=1 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Cross-strait relations ====
In December 2003, then-KMT chairman (present chairman emeritus) and presidential candidate Lien Chan initiated what appeared to some to be a major shift in the party's position on the linked questions of Chinese reunification and Taiwan independence. Speaking to foreign journalists, Lien said that while the KMT was opposed to "immediate independence", it did not wish to be classed as "pro-reunificationist" either.

At the same time, [[Wang Jin-pyng]], speaker of the [[Legislative Yuan]] and the Pan-Blue Coalition's campaign manager in the 2004 presidential election, said that the party no longer opposed Taiwan's "eventual independence". This statement was later clarified as meaning that the KMT opposes any immediate decision on unification and independence and would like to have this issue resolved by future generations. The KMT's position on the cross-strait relations was redefined as hoping to remain in the current neither-independent-nor-united situation.

However, there had been a warming of relations between the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] and the PRC, with prominent members of both the KMT and PFP in active discussions with officials on the mainland. In February 2004, it appeared that KMT had opened a campaign office for the Lien-Soong ticket in Shanghai targeting Taiwanese businessmen. However, after an adverse reaction in Taiwan, the KMT quickly declared that the office was opened without official knowledge or authorization. In addition, the PRC issued a statement forbidding open campaigning in the mainland and formally stated that it had no preference as to which candidate won and cared only about the positions of the winning candidate.

In 2005, then-party chairman Lien Chan announced that he was to leave his office. The two leading contenders for the position included [[Ma Ying-jeou]] and Wang Jin-pyng. On 5 April 2005, [[Mayor of Taipei|Taipei Mayor]] Ma Ying-jeou said he wished to lead the opposition KMT with Wang Jin-pyng. On 16 July 2005, Ma was elected as KMT chairman in the [[2005 KMT chairmanship election|first contested leadership in KMT's 93-year history]]. Some 54% of the party's 1.04&nbsp;million members cast their ballots. Ma garnered 72.4% of vote share, or 375,056 votes, against Wang's 27.6%, or 143,268 votes. After failing to convince Wang to stay on as a vice chairman, Ma named holdovers [[Wu Po-hsiung]], [[Chiang Pin-kung]] and [[Lin Cheng-chi]] ({{lang|zh|林澄枝}}), as well as long-time party administrator and strategist [[John Kuan]] as vice-chairmen. All appointments were approved by a hand count of party delegates.

[[File:Kuomintang nanjing.jpg|thumb|[[Lien Chan]] (middle) and [[Wu Po-hsiung]] (second left) and the KMT touring the [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in [[Nanjing]], People's Republic of China when the [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|Pan-Blue coalition visited the mainland]] in 2005]]
On 28 March 2005, thirty members of the KMT, led by vice-chairman Chiang Pin-kung, [[2005 Kuomintang visits to Mainland|arrived in mainland China]]. This marked the first official visit by the KMT to the mainland since it was defeated by communist forces in 1949 (although KMT members including Chiang had made individual visits in the past). The delegates began their itinerary by paying homage to the revolutionary martyrs of the Tenth Uprising at [[Huanghuagang]]. They subsequently flew to the former ROC capital of [[Nanjing]] to commemorate Sun Yat-sen. <!-- The ''[[China Times]]'', a Taiwan-based newspaper, said the group was to meet Thursday with [[Jia Qinglin]], nominally fourth-ranking CPC politician and a deputy head of the cabinet-level [[Taiwan Affairs Office]]. A top agenda item for Chiang was the anti-secession law, passed by China's parliament earlier in the month that authorized the use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan if it were to move towards formal independence.--> During the trip, the KMT signed a 10-points agreement with the CPC. The proponents regarded this visit as the prelude of the third KMT-CPC cooperation, after the [[First United Front|First]] and [[Second United Front]]. Weeks afterwards, in May 2005, Chairman Lien Chan visited the mainland and met with [[Hu Jintao]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]. This marked the first meeting between leaders of the KMT and CPC after the end of [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. No agreements were signed because incumbent [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s government threatened to prosecute the KMT delegation for treason and violation of [[Law of the Republic of China|ROC laws]] prohibiting citizens from collaborating with CPC.

== Supporter base ==
Support for the KMT in Taiwan encompasses a wide range of social groups but is largely determined by age. KMT support tends to be higher in northern Taiwan and in urban areas, where it draws its backing from big businesses due to its policy of maintaining commercial links with mainland China. As of 2020 only 3% of KMT members are under 40 years of age.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200421/p2g/00m/0in/048000c|title=Taiwan's once-powerful Kuomintang faces make-or-break moment|work=[[The Mainichi]]|date=April 22, 2020|access-date=May 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429023403/https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200421/p2g/00m/0in/048000c|archive-date=29 April 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The KMT also has some support in the labor sector because of the many labor benefits and insurance implemented while the KMT was in power. The KMT traditionally has strong cooperation with military officers, teachers, and government workers. Among the ethnic groups in Taiwan, the KMT has stronger support among [[Mainland Chinese#Mainlanders in Taiwan|mainlanders]] and their descendants, for ideological reasons, and among [[Taiwanese aboriginals]]. The support for the KMT generally tend to be stronger in majority-[[Hakka]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking counties of Taiwan, in contrast to the [[Hokkien]]-majority southwestern counties that tend to support the [[Democratic Progressive Party]].

The deep-rooted hostility between Aboriginals and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the Aboriginal communities effective KMT networks, contribute to Aboriginal skepticism towards the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Aboriginals' tendency to vote for the KMT.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|last1=Damm|first1=Jens|editor1-last=Damm|editor1-first=Jens|editor2-last=Lim|editor2-first=Paul|title=European perspectives on Taiwan|date=2012|publisher=Springer VS|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783531943039|page=95|chapter=Multiculturalism in Taiwan and the Influence of Europe}}</ref> Aboriginals have criticized politicians for abusing the "indigenization" movement for political gains, such as aboriginal opposition to the DPP's "rectification" by recognizing the Taroko for political reasons, with the majority of mountain townships voting for [[Ma Ying-jeou]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOusAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false Simon 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520072855/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOusAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=20 May 2015 }}, p. 28.</ref> In 2005 the Kuomintang displayed a massive photo of the anti-Japanese Aboriginal leader [[Mona Rudao]] at its headquarters in honor of the 60th anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession from Japan to the Republic of China.<ref>{{cite news |date=26 October 2005 |script-title=zh:國民黨紀念光復稱莫那魯道抗日英雄 |url=http://www.lihpao.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-80741 |newspaper=[[:zh:台湾立报|Lihpao]] |language=zh-hant |access-date=26 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094925/http://www.lihpao.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-80741 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On social issues, the KMT doesn't take an official position on [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|same-sex marriage]], though most members of legislative committees, mayors of cities, and the most recent presidential candidate ([[Han Kuo-yu]]) oppose it. The party does, however, have a small faction that supports same-sex marriage, consisting mainly of young people and people in the [[Taipei metropolitan area]]. The opposition to same-sex marriage comes mostly from [[Christianity in Taiwan|Christian]] groups, who wield significant political influence within the KMT.<ref>{{cite news |author=Agence France-Presse in Taipei |title=Taiwan pins same-sex marriage hopes on political change |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1892493/taiwan-pins-same-sex-marriage-hopes-political-change |newspaper=South China Morning Post |date=18 December 2015 |access-date=17 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218004157/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1892493/taiwan-pins-same-sex-marriage-hopes-political-change |archive-date=18 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Leadership ===
The Kuomintang's constitution designated Sun Yat-sen as party president. After his death, the Kuomintang opted to keep that language in its constitution to honor his memory forever. The party has since been headed by a director-general (1927–1975) and a chairman (since 1975), positions which officially discharge the functions of the president.

== Ideology in mainland China ==
=== Chinese nationalism ===
The KMT was a nationalist revolutionary party which had been supported by the Soviet Union. It was organized on the [[Leninist]] principle of [[democratic centralism]].<ref name="Jonathan Fenby 2005 504"/>

The KMT had several influences upon its ideology by revolutionary thinking. The KMT and Chiang Kai-shek used the words [[feudal]] and [[counterrevolutionary]] as synonyms for evil and backwardness, and they proudly proclaimed themselves to be [[revolutionary|revolutionaries]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Edgar Snow|title=Red Star Over China – The Rise of the Red Army|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYUABRj8IDwC&pg=PA89|access-date=28 June 2010|year=2008|publisher=READ BOOKS|isbn=978-1-4437-3673-2|page=89|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205143957/https://books.google.com/books?id=yYUABRj8IDwC&pg=PA89|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Jieru Chen, Lloyd E.

Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the KMT, warned the Soviet Union and other foreign countries about interfering in Chinese affairs. He was personally angry at the way China was treated by foreigners, mainly by the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States.<ref name="google65"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Fenby|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C|access-date=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|isbn=978-0-7867-1484-1|page=413|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205021230/https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> He and his [[New Life Movement]] called for the crushing of Soviet, Western, American and other foreign influences in China.

It was also noted that "the white bear of the North Pole is known for its viciousness and cruelty".<ref name="google268"/>

The [[Blue Shirts Society]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] paramilitary organization within the KMT that modeled itself after [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s [[blackshirts]], was [[Xenophobia|anti-foreign]] and [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], and it stated that its agenda was to expel foreign (Japanese and Western) imperialists from China, crush Communism, and eliminate feudalism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frederic E.

KMT leaders across China adopted nationalist rhetoric. The Chinese Muslim general [[Ma Bufang]] of [[Qinghai]] presented himself as a Chinese nationalist to the people of China, fighting against British imperialism, to deflect criticism by opponents that his government was feudal and oppressed minorities like Tibetans and Buddhist Mongols. He used his Chinese nationalist credentials to his advantage to keep himself in power.<ref>{{cite book|author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC|access-date=28 June 2010|year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1144-6|page=48|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107203538/https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC|archive-date=7 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC|access-date=28 June 2010|year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1144-6|page=49|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107203538/https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC|archive-date=7 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The KMT pursued a [[sinicization]] policy, it was stated that "the time had come to set about the business of making all natives either turn Chinese or get out" by foreign observers of KMT policy. It was noted that "Chinese colonization" of "Mongolia and Manchuria" led "to a conviction that the day of the barbarian was finally over".<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Orient: A Series of Monographs on Oriental Culture|url=https://archive.org/details/neworientserieso011newo|url-access=registration|access-date=29 May 2011|year=1933|publisher=New Orient Society of America|page=[https://archive.org/details/neworientserieso011newo/page/116 116]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Carus|title=The Open court, Volume 47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrjQAAAAMAAJ|access-date=29 May 2011|year=1934|publisher=The Open Court Pub.

=== New Guangxi Clique ===
KMT branch in Guangxi province, led by the [[New Guangxi Clique]] of [[Bai Chongxi]] and [[Li Zongren]], implemented anti-imperialist, anti-religious, and anti-foreign policies. During the Northern Expedition, in 1926 in Guangxi, Muslim General [[Bai Chongxi]] led his troops in destroying most of the Buddhist temples and smashing idols, turning the temples into schools and KMT headquarters. Bai led an anti-foreign wave in Guangxi, attacking American, European, and other foreigners and missionaries, and generally making the province unsafe for non-natives. Westerners fled from the province, and some Chinese Christians were also attacked as imperialist agents.<ref name="google99">{{cite book|author=Diana Lary|title=Region and Nation: The Kwangsi Clique in Chinese Politics, 1925–1937|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ|access-date=28 June 2010|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-20204-6|pages=98–99|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204225209/https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ|archive-date=4 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The leaders clashed with Chiang Kai-shek, which led to the Central Plains War where Chiang defeated the clique.

=== Socialism and anti-capitalist agitation ===
{{main|Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang|Canton Merchant Volunteers Corps Uprising}}
KMT had a left wing and a right wing, the left being more radical in its pro-Soviet policies, but both wings equally persecuted merchants, accusing them of being counterrevolutionaries and reactionaries. The right wing under Chiang Kai-shek prevailed, and continued radical policies against private merchants and industrialists, even as they denounced communism.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

One of the Three Principles of the People of KMT, Mínshēng, was defined as socialism by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. He defined this principle of saying in his last days "its socialism and its communism". The concept may be understood as [[social welfare]] as well. Sun understood it as an industrial economy and equality of land holdings for the Chinese peasant farmers. Here he was influenced by the American thinker [[Henry George]] (see [[Georgism]]) and German thinker [[Karl Marx]]; the [[land value tax]] in Taiwan is a legacy thereof. He divided livelihood into four areas: food, clothing, housing, and transportation; and planned out how an ideal (Chinese) government can take care of these for its people.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

KMT was referred to having a socialist ideology. "Equalization of land rights" was a clause included by Dr. Sun in the original Tongmenhui. KMT's revolutionary ideology in the 1920s incorporated unique Chinese Socialism as part of its ideology.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arif Dirlik|title=The Marxism in the Chinese Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-aGLEtx7AYC&pg=PA20|access-date=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3069-0|page=20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205042103/https://books.google.com/books?id=S-aGLEtx7AYC&pg=PA20|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}<br />{{cite book|author=Von KleinSmid Institute of International Affairs, University of Southern California.

KMT attempted to levy taxes upon merchants in Canton, and the merchants resisted by raising an army, the Merchant's volunteer corps. Dr. Sun initiated this anti-merchant policy, and Chiang Kai-shek enforced it, Chiang led his army of [[Whampoa Military Academy]] graduates to defeat the merchant's army.

In 1948, KMT again attacked the merchants of Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek sent his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] to restore economic order. Ching-kuo copied Soviet methods, which he learned during his stay there, to start a social revolution by attacking middle-class merchants. He also enforced low prices on all goods to raise support from the [[proletariat]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Fenby|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C|access-date=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|isbn=978-0-7867-1484-1|page=485|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205021230/https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

As riots broke out and savings were ruined, bankrupting shop owners, Ching-kuo began to attack the wealthy, seizing assets and placing them under arrest. The son of the gangster [[Du Yuesheng]] was arrested by him. Ching-kuo ordered KMT agents to raid the Yangtze Development Corporation's warehouses, which was privately owned by [[H.H. Kung]] and his family. H.H. Kung's wife was [[Soong Ai-ling]], the sister of [[Soong Mei-ling]] who was Ching-kuo's stepmother. H.H. Kung's son David was arrested, the Kung's responded by blackmailing the Chiang's, threatening to release information about them, eventually he was freed after negotiations, and Ching-kuo resigned, ending the terror on the Shanghainese merchants.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Fenby|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&pg=PA339|access-date=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|isbn=978-0-7867-1484-1|page=486|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205032642/https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&pg=PA339|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

KMT also promotes [[government-owned corporation]]s. KMT founder Sun Yat-sen, was heavily influenced by the economic ideas of Henry George, who believed that the rents extracted from [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] or the usage of land belonged to the public. Dr. Sun argued for Georgism and emphasized the importance of a mixed economy, which he termed "The Principle of Minsheng" in his Three Principles of the People.

"The railroads, public utilities, canals, and forests should be nationalized, and all income from the land and mines should be in the hands of the State. With this money in hand, the State can therefore finance the social welfare programs."<ref>Simei Qing "From Allies to Enemies," 19</ref>

KMT Muslim Governor of [[Ningxia]], [[Ma Hongkui]] promoted state-owned monopolies.

Corporations such as [[CSBC Corporation, Taiwan]], [[CPC Corporation, Taiwan]] and [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation]] are owned by the state in the Republic of China.

[[Marxist]]s also existed in KMT.

The KMT backed the New Life Movement, which promoted Confucianism, and it was also against westernization. KMT leaders also opposed the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Chiang Kai-shek, as a nationalist, and Confucianist, was against the iconoclasm of the May Fourth Movement. He viewed some western ideas as foreign, as a Chinese nationalist, and that the introduction of western ideas and literature that the May Fourth Movement wanted was not welcome. He and [[Sun Yat-sen]] criticized these May Fourth intellectuals for corrupting morals of youth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph T.

KMT purged China's education system of Western ideas, introducing Confucianism into the curriculum. Education came under the total control of state, which meant, in effect, the KMT, via the Ministry of Education. Military and political classes on KMT's ''Three Principles of the People'' were added.

The [[Tibet Improvement Party]] was founded by [[Pandatsang Rapga]], a pro-ROC and pro-KMT [[Kham]]pa revolutionary, who worked against the [[14th Dalai Lama]]'s Tibetan Government in [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]]. Rapga borrowed Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People doctrine and translated his political theories into the Tibetan language, hailing it as the best hope for Asian peoples against imperialism. Rapga stated that "the Sanmin Zhuyi was intended for all peoples under the domination of foreigners, for all those who had been deprived of the rights of man. But it was conceived especially for the Asians. It is for this reason that I translated it.

Brotherhood Imams like [[Hu Songshan]] ordered Muslims to pray for the Nationalist Government, salute KMT flags during prayer, and listen to nationalist sermons.

== Policy on ethnic minorities ==
KMT considers all minorities to be members of the Chinese nation. Former KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek considered all the minority peoples of China, including the Hui, as descendants of [[Yellow Emperor]], the Yellow Emperor and semi mythical founder of the Chinese nation. Chiang considered all the minorities to belong to the Chinese Nation [[Zhonghua Minzu]] and he introduced this into KMT ideology, which was propagated into the educational system of the Republic of China, and the Constitution of the ROC considered Chiang's ideology to be true.<ref>{{cite book|author=Murray A.

== Stance on separatism ==
KMT is anti-separatist. During its rule on mainland China, it crushed Uyghur and Tibetan separatist uprisings. KMT claims sovereignty over [[Outer Mongolia]] and [[Tuva]] as well as the territories of the modern People's Republic and Republic of China.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/10/08/2003425320|title=Ma refers to China as ROC territory in magazine interview}}</ref>

KMT Muslim General Ma Bufang waged war on the invading Tibetans during the [[Sino-Tibetan War]] with his Muslim army, and he repeatedly crushed Tibetan revolts during bloody battles in Qinghai provinces. Ma Bufang was fully supported by President Chiang Kai-shek, who ordered him to prepare his Muslim army to invade Tibet several times and threatened aerial bombardment on the Tibetans. With support from KMT, Ma Bufang repeatedly attacked the Tibetan area of [[Golog]] seven times during the [[Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai|KMT Pacification of Qinghai]], eliminating thousands of Tibetans.<ref name="google54">{{cite book|author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's Edge: History and the Politics of National Unity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC|access-date=28 June 2010|year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1144-6|page=273|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107203538/https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC|archive-date=7 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

General [[Ma Fuxiang]], the chairman of the [[Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission]] stated that Mongolia and Tibet were an integral part of the Republic of China, arguing:
<blockquote>Our Party [the Guomindang] takes the development of the weak and small and resistance to the strong and violent as our sole and most urgent task. This is even more true for those groups which are not of our kind [Ch. fei wo zulei zhe]. Now the people of Mongolia and Tibet are closely related to us, and we have great affection for one another: our common existence and common honor already have a history of over a thousand years. [...] Mongolia and Tibet's life and death are China's life and death. China absolutely cannot cause Mongolia and Tibet to break away from China's territory, and Mongolia and Tibet cannot reject China to become independent. At this time, there is not a single nation on earth except China that will sincerely develop Mongolia and Tibet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|title=Familiar Strangers: A History of Muslims in Northwest China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90CN0vtxdY0C&pg=PA167|access-date=2010-06-28|year=2004|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=978-0-295-97644-0|page=266|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205041900/https://books.google.com/books?id=90CN0vtxdY0C&pg=PA167|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>
