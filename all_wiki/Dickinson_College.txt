'''Dickinson College''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]]. Founded in 1773 as Carlisle Grammar School, Dickinson was chartered September 9, 1783,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickinson.edu/admit/qfacts.html |website=Dickinson College |title=Dickinson Facts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405054542/http://www.dickinson.edu/admit/qfacts.html |archive-date=2007-04-05 }}</ref> six days after the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], making it the first college to be founded after the formation of the [[United States]]. Dickinson was founded by [[Benjamin Rush]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], and named "John and Mary's College" in honor of [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], a signer of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] who was later the [[governor of Pennsylvania]], and his wife [[Mary Norris Dickinson]]. They donated much of their extensive personal libraries to the new college.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jhmas/III.3.427 |last=Butterfield|first=L.H.|title=Benjamin Rush and the Beginning of John and Mary's College Over the Susquehanna|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|volume=III|issue=3|pages=427–442|year=1948|publisher=Oxford Journals }}</ref>

In addition to offering either a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree in 22 disciplinary majors and 20 interdisciplinary majors, Dickinson offers an engineering option through its 3:2 program, which consists of three years at Dickinson and two years at an engineering school of [[Columbia University]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], or [[Case Western Reserve University]]. Upon successful completion of both portions of the program, students receive the B.S. degree from Dickinson in their chosen field and the B.S. in engineering from the engineering school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/473/pre-engineering_curriculum|title=Engineering option |website=Dickinson College |access-date=19 September 2014}}</ref>

The [[Dickinson School of Law]] is located adjacent to the college campus and was founded in 1834 as its law department. It received an independent charter in 1890 and ended all affiliation with the college in 1917.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dickinson Story|url=http://www.dickinson.edu/info/20048/history_of_the_college/1404/the_dickinson_story|website=The Dickinson Story|publisher=Dickinson College}}</ref> In 2000, the law school merged with the Pennsylvania State University.

==History==
===18th–20th centuries===
The Carlisle Grammar School was founded in 1773 as a frontier Latin school for young men in western Pennsylvania. Within years Carlisle's elite, such as [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] and [[John Montgomery (delegate)|John Montgomery]], were pushing for development of the school as a college. In 1782, [[Benjamin Rush]], a physician who was a prominent leader during and after the American Revolution, met in [[Philadelphia]] with Montgomery and [[William Bingham]], a prominent businessman and politician. As their conversation about founding a frontier college in Carlisle took place on his porch, "Bingham's Porch" was long a rallying cry at Dickinson.

Dickinson College was chartered by the Pennsylvania legislature on September 9, 1783, six days after the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] that ended the [[American Revolution]]; it was the first college to be founded in the newly independent nation. Rush intended to name the college after the [[Governor of Pennsylvania|president of Pennsylvania]] [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] and his wife [[Mary Norris Dickinson]], proposing "John and Mary's College." The Dickinsons had given the new college an extensive library which they jointly owned, one of the largest libraries in the colonies.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Books of Isaac Norris at Dickinson College|url=http://deila.dickinson.edu/norris/about.html|publisher=The Dickinson Electronic Initiative in the Liberal Arts|access-date=11 February 2013|website=Dickinson College}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0810884984|last=McKenney|first=Janice E.|title=Women of the Constitution: Wives of the Signers|url=https://archive.org/details/womenofconstitut0000mcke|url-access=registration|date=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The name Dickinson College was chosen instead. When founded, its location west of the [[Susquehanna River]] made it the westernmost college in the United States. For the first meeting of the trustees, held in April 1784, Rush made his first journey to Carlisle. The trustees selected [[Charles Nisbet]], a Scottish minister and scholar, to serve as the College's first president. He arrived and began to serve on July 4, 1785, serving until his unexpected death in 1804.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/encyclo/n/ed_nisbetC.htm |title=Charles Nisbet, First President of Dickinson College |website=Dickinson College |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230051716/http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/encyclo/n/ed_nisbetC.htm |archive-date=2007-12-30 }}</ref>

[[File:Dickinson College 9.JPG|thumb|Waidner-Spahr Library]]
A combination of financial troubles and faculty dissension led to a college closing from 1816 to 1821. In 1832, when the trustees were unable to resolve a faculty curriculum dispute, they ordered Dickinson's temporary closure a second time.<ref name=hist>{{cite web |url=https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20048/history_of_the_college/1404/the_dickinson_story |title=The Dickinson Story |website=Dickinson College }}</ref>

The law school dates to 1833. It became a separate school 1890, although the law school and the college continued to share a president until 1912. The law school is now affiliated with the [[Pennsylvania State University]].<ref name=hist/>

Among the 18th-century graduates of Dickinson were [[Robert Cooper Grier]] and [[Roger Brooke Taney]], who later became [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices, and served together on the court for 18 years.

During the 19th century, two noted Dickinson College alumni had prominent roles in the lead up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. They were [[James Buchanan]], the 15th [[president of the United States]], and [[Roger Brooke Taney]], the 5th [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice of the United States]]. Dickinson is one of three liberal arts colleges to have graduated a president and a chief justice ([[Bowdoin College|Bowdoin]] and [[Amherst College|Amherst]] are the others). Taney led the Supreme Court in its ruling on the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' decision, which held that Congress could not prohibit slavery in federal territories, overturning the Missouri Compromise. Buchanan threw the full prestige of his administration behind congressional approval of the [[Lecompton Constitution]] in Kansas. During the Civil War, the campus and town of Carlisle were occupied twice by Confederate forces in 1863.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/timeline/1851_1900.htm |title=1851-1900 Timeline |website=Chronicles |publisher=Dickinson College |access-date=2009-10-08 }}</ref>

When George Metzger, class of 1798, died in 1879, he left his land and $25,000 ({{Inflation|US|25000|1879|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) to the town of Carlisle to found a college for women. In 1881, the Metzger Institute opened. The college operated independently until 1913, when its building was leased to Dickinson College for the education of women. The building served as a women's dorm until 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/encyclo/m/ed_metzgerhall.html |title=Metzger Hall |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409221647/http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/encyclo/m/ed_metzgerhall.html |archive-date=2009-04-09 |work=Chronicles |publisher=Dickinson College |access-date=2009-10-08 }}</ref>

The town of Carlisle was also the location of the Carlisle Army Barracks, which was adapted in the late 1870s for use as the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]]. In 1879 Dickinson College and the nearby Carlisle Indian School began a collaboration, when [[James Andrew McCauley]], president of the college, led the first worship service at the Indian School. The collaboration between the institutions lasted almost four decades, from the opening day to the closing of the Indian School in 1918. Dickinson College professors served as chaplains and special faculty to the Native American students.<ref>Professor Charles Francis Himes, Dr. George Edward Reed, Stephen Baird, and Joshua Lippincott fostered the relationship between the institutions through religious services, advisory meetings, lectures, and commencement speeches. http://wiki.dickinson.edu/index.php?title=Influence_from_the_Faculty_at_Dickinson&action=edit</ref> Dickinson College students volunteered services, observed teaching methods, and participated in events at the Indian School.<ref>Dickinson students visited the Indian School to offer their talents and services. The October 24, 1896 ''Dickinsonian'' reported that volunteer Sunday School teachers came from the college chapter of the YMCA. Those teachers with Indian students were said to "enjoy a rare privilege. The work is doubly interesting because one can be studying the characteristics of his scholars, at the same time learning many valuable lessons in methods of teaching." The college gave Dickinson students a half-day holiday to attend the annual commencement and "very interesting exercises" at the Indian School.</ref> Dickinson College accepted select Indian School students to attend its Preparatory School ("Conway Hall") and gain college-level education.<!--What does this mean? Why didn't they let them attend actual college classes?--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.dickinson.edu/index.php/History_of_Conway_Hall|title=History of Conway Hall |website=Dickinson College Wiki|access-date=19 September 2014}}</ref>

Dickinson also admitted Native American students directly: Thomas Marshall was one of the first such students at Dickinson. In 1910, [[Frank Mount Pleasant]] was the first Native American to graduate from Dickinson College.

===21st century===
Since 2000, Dickinson's acceptance rate has dropped by 20%, [[SAT]] scores have risen by 100 points, and the institutional endowment has more than doubled.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickinson.edu/departments/insres/index.htm |title=Institutional Research |website=Dickinson College |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202105648/http://www.dickinson.edu/departments/insres/index.htm |archive-date=2007-12-02 }}</ref>

In 2000 Dickinson opened a new science building, Tome Hall, a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary facility to host astronomy, computer science, math, and physics. Tome houses Dickinson's innovative "Workshop Physics" program and was the first stage of a new science complex.<ref>{{cite web|website=Dickinson College|url=http://physics.dickinson.edu/~wp_web/WP_homepage.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021019085903/http://physics.dickinson.edu/~wp_web/WP_homepage.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 October 2002|title=Workshop Physics Homepage|access-date=19 September 2014}}</ref> Opened in 2008, the LEED Gold certified Rector Science Complex serves as a place of scientific exploration and learning in an environment that is artful and sustainable. Featuring {{convert|90000|sqft|m2}} of laboratories, classrooms and research facilities, it houses the departments of biology, chemistry, psychology and interdisciplinary programs in biochemistry & molecular biology and neuroscience. Courses in the emerging fields of [[bioinformatics]] and [[nanotechnology]] are also taught there.

On January 22, 2013, Dickinson announced that it had acquired Allison United Methodist Church for college expansion. A longtime landmark in Carlisle, Allison's limestone building and property is contiguous with the Benjamin Rush campus of Dickinson. The building, located at 99&nbsp;Mooreland Avenue, provides the college with more than {{convert|33000|sqft|m2}} for events, guest speakers, student presentations, meetings, ecumenical worship and additional offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dickinson.edu/news/article/136/a_landmark_addition|title=Allison Church Announcement|website=Dickinson College|access-date=19 September 2014}}</ref>

Dickinson aims for campus [[environmental sustainability]] through several initiative. In the Sustainable Endowments Institute's 2010 green report card Dickinson was one of only 15 schools in the USA to receive an A-, the highest grade possible. In the same year, Dickinson was named a Sierra magazine "Cool" School" in its ''Comprehensive Guide to the Most Eco-Enlightened U.S. Colleges: Live (Green) and Learn''.<ref name=Sierra>{{cite web|title=Cool Schools: Top 100 Schools- September/October 2010 |website=[[Sierra Club]] |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/201009/coolschools/top100.aspx |access-date=December 2, 2012 |author=Sierra Magazine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005150551/http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/201009/coolschools/top100.aspx |archive-date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref> The college's commitment to making study of the environment and sustainability a defining characteristic of a Dickinson education was also recognised through being top of The Princeton Review's 2010 Green Honor Roll.<ref name="Green-honor">{{cite web|title=Dickinson Lands on the Green Honor Roll |url=http://www.dickinson.edu/news-and-events/news/2009-10/Dickinson-Lands-on-the-Green-Honor-Roll/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104083428/http://www.dickinson.edu/news-and-events/news/2009-10/Dickinson-Lands-on-the-Green-Honor-Roll/ |archive-date=2013-01-04 |website=Dickinson College }}</ref>

==Campus==
[[File:Dickinson College 2.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Academic Quad showing Bosler Hall.]]
Dickinson's quiet campus is three blocks from the main square in the historic small town of Carlisle, the county seat of [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania]], and the site of the nation's second oldest military base, [[Carlisle Barracks]], which is now used as the [[U.S. Army War College]]. The campus is characterized by [[limestone]]-clad buildings and has numerous trees.
[[File:Sunset JO.jpg|thumb|Sunset outside Waidner Spahr Library.]]
The frontier grammar school was founded in 1773 and housed in a small, two-room brick building on Liberty Avenue, near Bedford and Pomfret streets. When Dickinson College was founded in 1783, this building was expanded to accommodate all the functions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/resources/Biddle/text.html|title=The Old College Lot|first=Robert|last=Reeves |website=Dickinson College |access-date=7 December 2016}}</ref> In 1799 the Penn family sold {{convert|7|acre|ha}} on the western edge of Carlisle to the nascent college, which became its campus. On June 20 of that year, the [[cornerstone]] was laid by founding trustee [[John Montgomery (delegate)|John Montgomery]] for a building on the new land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/histories/morgan/chapter_7.html|website=Dickinson College|title=Morgan's History - College Sites and Early Buildings|access-date=7 December 2016}}</ref> The twelve-room building burned to the ground on February 3, 1803, five weeks after opening its doors. The college operations were temporarily returned to its previous accommodations.

[[File:Westcollege1810.jpg|thumb|300px|The original Dickinson College building, now known as West College, was designed by [[Benjamin Latrobe]]. This illustration is circa 1810.]]
[[File:Dickinson College 7.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the planetarium.]]
Within weeks of the fire, a national fundraising campaign was launched, enticing donations from President [[Thomas Jefferson]], Secretary of State [[James Madison]], Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], and many others. [[Benjamin Latrobe]], already noted for his design work on the [[Bank of Pennsylvania]] and [[Princeton University]]'s [[Nassau Hall]], and soon-to-be named as [[Architect of the Capitol]], was chosen to design the new structure. Latrobe's design for the building, now known as "West College" or "Old West," featured monumental and classical elements within a simple and subdued academic style. The building was to be capped with a classically inspired [[cupola]] graced by a figure of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]. The local craftsman instead created a [[mermaid]], which has since been a symbol of the college. Latrobe, who donated his services to the college, visited the building for the first time in 1813. The total cost of West College topped $22,000 and, although classes began in 1805, work was not finished until 1822. More than 200 years after its doors opened for the first time, Old West is today the ceremonial heart of the college, as all students march through the open doors during [[convocation]] at the beginning of their freshman year, and march out the same doors to receive their degrees and graduate. Old West, which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], also houses the college administration, several classrooms, a computer lab, and the college chapel.

Throughout the 19th century Dickinson expanded across what has now become its main academic quadrangle, known formally as the John Dickinson Campus. Dickinson expanded across College Street to build the Holland Union Building and Waidner-Spahr Library, which along with several dormitories, makes up the Benjamin Rush Campus. Across High Street ([[U.S. Route 11]]) lies the Charles Nisbet Campus, home to the largest grouping of dormitories. The [[Dickinson School of Law]], part of Penn State, lies directly to the south of the Nisbet Campus. Together these three grass-covered units compose the vast majority of the College's campus, though several outlying buildings surround these main areas. In addition, the College owns playing fields and a large organic farm, both of which are only a short distance from the main campus.

Buildings of note include:
* ''Althouse Hall''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/encyclo/a/ed_althousehall.htm |title=Althouse Science Hall |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912082226/http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/encyclo/a/ed_althousehall.htm |archive-date=2007-09-12 |website=Dickinson College }}</ref> - A science hall opened in 1958, Althouse housed the chemistry department until it moved to the new Rector Science Complex. Since the spring 2010 semester, this building houses the International Business & Management Program as well as the Economics department.
* ''Bosler Hall''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/encyclo/b/ed_boslerhall.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116072437/http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/encyclo/b/ed_boslerhall.html|url-status=dead|title=Bosler Hall|website=Dickinson College|archive-date=January 16, 2008}}</ref> - Completed in 1886, the building was Dickinson's first purpose-built library. Today it houses foreign language classes.
