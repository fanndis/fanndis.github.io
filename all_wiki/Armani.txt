While Armani Collezioni will merge back into the "Giorgio Armani" line, Armani Jeans will be mixed with the Emporio Armani line due to their similarities in styles and the use of the same brand logo.

===Armani Collezioni===
[[File:Armani at Indooroopilly Shopping Centre 08.JPG|thumb|''Armani Collezioni'' at Indooroopilly Shopping Centre]]

''Armani Collezioni'' (formerly ''Giorgio Armani Le Collezioni'') was the diffusion line of Giorgio Armani that retails at a lower price than ''Giorgio Armani'' and the [[haute couture]] line, ''Armani Privé''. The logo was usually displayed black written on a white label, but often varies.  "Armani" being larger and "Collezioni" underneath it. It has provided [[made-to-measure]] tailored suits and shirts where every element can be chosen. In addition to being sold in the two freestanding boutiques (which feature the ''Collezioni'' line exclusively) in Milan and Paris, ''Armani Collezioni'' usually sold in department stores and outlets while Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani only sold in freestanding boutiques.

Last year, a sporty line of this label has appeared named "Armani Collezioni Active" in the same way as the EA7 line from Emporio Armani line.

===Armani Exchange===
[[File:Axsg.jpg|thumb|''Armani Exchange'' store at [[Marina Bay Sands]], [[Singapore]]]]

''A|X Armani Exchange'' was launched in 1991 in the U.S. It retails fashion and lifestyle products and is known for its occasionally provocative ad campaigns. Inspired by street-chic culture and [[dance music]], it is targeted as the more accessible Armani brand.

To accelerate development of the nascent line, Giorgio Armani co-established the [[joint venture]] company Presidio Holdings Ltd in 2005 alongside Como Holdings, the company owned by the Singaporean tycoon [[Ong Beng Seng]]  that, since 1994, has held the production and distribution license for A/X Armani Exchange in the United States, Canada, Central and South America and Asia-Pacific.

Initially, the Italian company held 25% of Presidio Holdings, the remaining 75% in the hands of Como Holdings. In 2008, Giorgio Armani acquired an additional 25% stake. In 2014, it acquired the remaining 50% "ensuring full ownership of the brand, which has 270 stores and over 3,000 employees", the company said in a statement.

Armani Exchange products are available exclusively in 270 stores in 31 countries and on the brand's website.

===Armani Junior===
[[File:ArmaniJuniorNewYork.jpg|thumbnail|left|An ''Armani Junior'' boutique in New York City, United States in 2013.]]

Giorgio Armani also designs products specifically made for babies, toddlers and teenagers up to sixteen years old. Therefore, he came up with a new label called ''Armani Junior'' with a separate label within the product line entitled ''Armani Baby''. The ''Armani Junior'' brand was introduced in 1979. The sub-label was often criticized in the public eye because Armani occasionally used real fur for the ''Armani Junior'' autumn and winter collections. Many people tend to think that it's unreasonable for a large amount of the public to dress small children in high-end, luxury clothing, which families with a regular or even comfortable income cannot afford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bunte.de/meldungen/quvenzhane-wallis-star-der-ersten-armani-junior-kampagne-87080.html|title=Quvenzhané Wallis: Star der ersten Armani Junior-Kampagne|publisher=Bunte.de|language=de|access-date=30 January 2016}}</ref> The junior line consists of baby clothing and accessories as well as T-shirts, pullovers, suits, smokings, shoes, hats, shirts, belts, bags, underwear and accessories for children and teenagers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armani.com/armanijunior|title=Armani Junior|publisher=Armani|access-date=30 January 2016}}</ref>

''Armani Junior'' has 167 independent boutiques around the globe, which only sell the sub-label . The label is also sold in other stores by the label including ''Armani/Casa'', ''Armani Jeans'' or ''Emporio Armani''. In total, 308 independent and franchise ''Armani'' stores sell the ''Armani Junior'' and ''Armani Baby'' products throughout the whole world.<ref name="Stores">{{cite web|url=http://storelocator.armani.com|title=Store Locator Armani|publisher=Armani Group|access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref> In addition, the label is available in selected department stores everywhere in the world, for example Neiman Marcus, [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[Breuninger]] and [[Peek & Cloppenburg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/quvenzhane-wallis-named-face-armani-706440|title=Quvenzhane Wallis named the new face of Armani|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=30 January 2016}}</ref>

The sub-label sold products worth 2600 million Euros and earned about 750 million in 2010. In 2011, it sold products worth about 3100 Euros and earned about 900 Euros. In 2012, the label earned 1100 million Euros, selling products worth 3.6 billion Euros. In 2013, the label gained sales of about 3.55 billion Euros, earning again 1.1 billion Euros that year alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fashionbi.com/brands/armani-junior/financials|title=Armani Junior Financials|publisher=Fashionbi|access-date=30 January 2016}}</ref>

===Armani/Casa===

When Armani was asked about why he wanted a furniture line, Armani said that he wanted "people to design their own private home". "Designing this furniture and home collection helped me to stimulate my creative and artistic vein", Armani said. Critics responded very positively to the ''Armani/Casa'' label calling the style "simply elegant, a little retro with Ethno elements" to it. A lot of critics also liked the fact that there are only a "few ornaments" used but with "artistic detail" which seem to have a "tremendous effect on the style and furniture" itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://luxus.welt.de/fashion/klassiker/giorgio-armani|title=Schöner wohnen mit Armani|publisher=Luxus Welt|language=de|access-date=30 January 2016}}</ref>

Each collection is personally designed by Giorgio Armani himself as he wants to transport an "Asian feel".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armanifiori.com/en/collections/floreal|title=Collections: Floreal – Armani/Fiori|publisher=Armani Group|access-date=5 February 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216233713/http://www.armanifiori.com/en/collections/floreal|archive-date=16 February 2016}}</ref> In addition, ''Armani/Fiori'' offers decorative elements like [[vase]]s, [[flowerpot]]s, [[candle]]s and [[lantern]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amsterdam-ftv-blog.com/archives/959|title=Armani/Fiori|work=Amsterdam Fashion TV Blog|publisher=Victoria France Holding|date=24 July 2012|access-date=5 February 2016}}</ref> For the collections, Armani uses precious materials like [[alabaster]], [[Marble|black marble]], [[wood|lacquered wood]] in the shape of [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s, [[cube]]s, and [[rhomboid]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armanifiori.com/en/collections/decorative-elements|title=Collections: Decorative elements – Armani/Fiori|publisher=Armani Group|access-date=5 February 2016}}</ref> Giorgio Armani also designed special floral arrangements for occasions like Valentine's Day<ref>{{cite web|first=Meimei|last=Song|url=http://hk.asiatatler.com/stories/culture/valentine-s-day-hong-kong-florists|title=Valentine's Day: Hong Kong Florists|work=Hong Kong Tatler|publisher=Edipresse Media Asia Limited|date=1 February 2011|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216191350/http://hk.asiatatler.com/stories/culture/valentine-s-day-hong-kong-florists|archive-date=16 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and spring collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alive.armani.com/news/us/spring-2014-collection-from-armani-fiori/|title=Spring 2014 Collection from Armani/Fiori|work=Armani/Alive|publisher=Armani Group|date=1 April 2014|access-date=5 February 2016}}</ref> The labels floral arrangements are used in the ''Armani'' hotels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dubai.armanihotels.com/retail-en.html|title=Armani Hotel Dubai – Retail|work=Armani/Hotels|publisher=Armani Group|access-date=5 February 2016}}</ref>
