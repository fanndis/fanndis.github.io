'''Horst Köhler''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɔɐ̯st ˈkøːlɐ|lang|De-Horst Köhler.ogg}}; born 22 February 1943) is a German politician of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], and served as [[President of Germany]] from 2004 to 2010. As the candidate of the two Christian Democratic sister parties, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]], and the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], Köhler was [[2004 German presidential election|elected]] to his first five-year term by the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Federal Assembly]] on 23 May 2004 and was subsequently inaugurated on 1 July 2004. He was [[2009 German presidential election|reelected]] to a second term on 23 May 2009. Just a year later, on 31 May 2010, he resigned from his office in a controversy over his comment on the role of the German [[Bundeswehr]] in light of a visit to the troops in [[Afghanistan]]. During his tenure as German President, whose office is mostly concerned with ceremonial matters, Köhler was a highly popular politician, with approval rates above those of both chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] and later chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/04/world/europe/suddenly-in-the-limelight-the-president-of-germany.html|title=Suddenly, in the Limelight, the President of Germany|last=Landler|first=Mark|date=2005-07-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Köhler is an [[economics|economist]] by profession. Prior to his election as President, Köhler had a distinguished career in politics and the civil service and as a banking executive. He was President of the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] from 1998 to 2000 and head of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) from 2000 to 2004. From 2012 to 2013, Köhler served on the UN Secretary General's High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.<ref>UN Secretary-General appoints Horst Köhler to High-level Advisory Panel; News Corner of the Permanent Mission of Germany to the United Nations - New York; from 01. August 2012</ref>

==Early life==
Köhler was born in [[Skierbieszów]] (then named Heidenstein), in the [[General Government]] area of [[German-occupied Poland]], as the seventh child of Elisabeth and Eduard Köhler, into a family of [[Bessarabia Germans|Bessarabian Germans]] from [[Rîșcani]] in [[Romania]]n [[Bessarabia]] (near [[Bălți]], present-day [[Moldova]]). Horst Köhler's parents, ethnic Germans and Romanian citizens, had to leave their home in Bessarabia in 1940 during the [[Nazi-Soviet population transfers]] that followed the invasion of Poland and the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which awarded Bessarabia to the [[Soviet Union]]. As part of the [[Generalplan Ost]], they were resettled in 1942 at [[Skierbieszów]], a village near [[Zamość]], [[Poland]] (then part of the [[General Government]]). As the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' was pushed back and the first parts of Poland had to be abandoned in 1944, the Köhler family fled to [[Leipzig]]. In 1953, they left the [[German Democratic Republic|Soviet Zone]] – via [[West Berlin]] – to escape from the communist regime. The family lived in [[refugee camp]]s until 1957, when they settled in [[Ludwigsburg]]. Horst Köhler hence spent most of his first 14 years as a refugee.

==Studies and military service==
A teacher recommended that the refugee boy should apply for the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], and Köhler took his ''[[Abitur]]'' in 1963. After two years of military service at a [[Panzergrenadier]] battalion in [[Ellwangen]], he left the [[Bundeswehr]] as ''[[Leutnant]] der Reserve'' (Reserve Lieutenant). He studied and finally gained a [[doctorate]] in [[economics]] and [[political science]]s from the [[University of Tübingen]], where he was a scientific research assistant at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut für Angewandte Wirtschaftsforschung|de}} from 1969 to 1976.

==Career in the civil service==
Köhler joined the civil service in 1976, when he was employed in the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Economics]]. In 1981, he was employed in the Chancellory of the state government in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] under Prime Minister [[Gerhard Stoltenberg]]. The following year, Köhler was made head of the Ministers office in the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Finance]], upon Stoltenberg's recommendation. He rose to Director General for financial policy and federal industrial interests in 1987. In 1989 he became Director General for currency and credit.

==Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance==
A member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] since 1981, he was Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance from 1990 to 1993, and as such, the administrative head of the Ministry and the deputy of the Federal Minister of Finance ([[Theodor Waigel]]). In that capacity, he served as a "[[Sherpa (G8)|sherpa]]" (personal representative) for [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], preparing [[G7]] summits and other international economic conferences. As secretary of state, Köhler negotiated both the German-German monetary union<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/sarrazin-deutsch-deutsche-waehrungsunion-war-alternativlos.954.de.html?dram:article_id=145399|title=- Sarrazin: Deutsch-deutsche Währungsunion war alternativlos|website=Deutschlandfunk Kultur|language=de-DE|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> and the final withdrawal of Soviet troops from the GDR in 1994.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Strohmeier|first=Gerd|last2=Wittlinger|first2=Ruth|date=2010-03-01|title=Parliamentary Heads of State: Players or Figureheads?

Köhler also played a central role in organizing the enormously expensive privatization of state businesses in Eastern Germany. He organized the [[Treuhand]], the agency charged with selling 11,000 rusting and moribund companies.<ref>[[Edmund L. Andrews]] (March 15, 2000), [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/15/business/man-in-the-news-in-the-midst-of-upheaval-yet-out-of-public-sight-horst-kohler.html Man in the News; In the Midst of Upheaval, Yet Out of Public Sight: Horst Kohler] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

==Career in banking 1993–2000==
Between 1993 and 1998 he served as President of the association of savings banks in Germany, [[Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband]].

In 1998 Köhler was appointed president of the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], and settled in [[London]], where the headquarters of the bank is located. At the EBRD, he took over in September 1998, when the bank was facing annual losses of $305 million, largely due to the financial collapse of [[Russia]]. He took stock of the situation, then began to refocus the EBRD's notoriously lax investment policies and tighten up on opulence at the bank itself.<ref>Michael M.

==Head of the International Monetary Fund, 2000–2004==

Köhler was appointed Managing Director and Chairman of the Executive Board of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in 2000. The government of [[Gerhard Schröder]] nominated him after their first nominee, [[Caio Koch-Weser]], was rejected by the United States.<ref>Geoff Winestock (March 14, 2000), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB952958825409250763 EU Votes Unanimously to Support Germany's Koehler for IMF Post] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> Though respected, Köhler was not a particularly well known or prestigious figure in international financial circles.<ref>[[Edmund L.

In one of his first moves at the IMF, Köhler joined British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] in hosting a gathering of anti-poverty activists to discuss an international campaign to write off billions of dollars in debts that developing nations owe the IMF, World Bank and other government creditors.<ref>Michael M.

Before entering the office of Managing Director, Köhler had spent time in [[Indonesia]] during the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and thereafter cited it as an example of the fund's tendency towards intrusive micromanagement.<ref>Alan Beattie (July 19, 2008), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f503fa82-5159-11dd-b751-000077b07658.html Suharto and the crisis of Asian crony capitalism, January 1998] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> Instead, he intended to focus the Fund primarily on broad economic management and to reduce overlapping activity with the [[World Bank]].<ref>[[Joseph Kahn (journalist)|Joseph Kahn]] (August 8, 2000), [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/08/business/international-business-an-effort-by-us-to-change-the-imf-is-set-back.html An Effort by U.S. to Change the I.M.F. Is Set Back] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Shortly after taking office in 2000, he established the Financial Sector Review Group under the leadership of [[John Lipsky]] to provide an independent perspective on the Fund's work on international financial markets, In March 2001, on the group's recommendations, he created the International Capital Markets Department, a unit to anticipate and head off financial crises in countries to which the fund makes loans.<ref>[[David Stout]] (March 2, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/02/business/imf-creates-unit-to-spot-early-signs-of-foreign-crises.html I.M.F. Creates Unit to Spot Early Signs of Foreign Crises] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In 2001, Köhler recommended naming [[Timothy Geithner]] to replace Stanley Fischer as deputy managing director; instead, the US government under [[President of the United States of America|President]] [[George W. Bush]] successfully pushed for [[Anne O. Krueger]] to take the position.<ref>[[Joseph Kahn (journalist)|Joseph Kahn]] (June 8, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/08/business/a-stanford-economist-to-be-no-2-at-imf.html A Stanford Economist to Be No. 2 at I.M.F.] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In order to accept his nomination as presidential candidate, Köhler left the IMF a year before his term was scheduled to end in May 2005. Among his accomplishments were overseeing debt crises in [[Brazil]] and [[Turkey]] and expanding debt relief for the world's poorest countries. He had less success resolving the continuing debt problems in [[Argentina]].<ref>[[Richard Bernstein]] (March 5, 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/05/world/monetary-fund-chief-is-expected-to-be-president-of-germany.html Monetary Fund Chief Is Expected to Be President of Germany] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

He lived in [[Washington, D.C.]], from 2000 to 2004.

On 4 March 2004, Köhler resigned his post with the IMF after being nominated by Germany's conservative and liberal opposition parties as their presidential candidate. As these parties controlled a majority of votes in the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (an [[electoral college]] consisting of the membership of the [[Bundestag]] and an equal number of delegates appointed by the legislatures of each [[States of Germany|state]]), the result of the vote amounted to essentially a foregone conclusion, but was closer than expected. Köhler defeated [[Gesine Schwan]] on the first ballot by 604 votes to 580; 20 votes were cast for minor candidates, while one elector was absent because of a heart attack. Köhler succeeded [[Johannes Rau]] as President on 1 July 2004, for a five-year term. Germany's presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but is also invested with considerable [[moral authority]]. From 2004 until early 2006, [[Charlottenburg Palace]] was the seat of the President of Germany, whilst [[Schloss Bellevue]] was being renovated.

Upon his election, Köhler, a conservative German [[patriotism|patriot]], said that "Patriotism and being cosmopolitan are not opposites. ... He appeared an enlightened patriot who genuinely loves his country and is not afraid to say so", the newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' wrote. Presenting his visions for Germany, Köhler also said that "Germany should become a land of ideas", and emphasized the importance of globalization, and that Germany would have to compete for its place in the 21st century. Domestically, President Köhler became concerned with the question of how to preserve and create jobs in an internationally competitive environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/Horst-Koehler/Reden/2005/03/20050315_Rede.html|title=www.bundespraesident.de: Der Bundespräsident / Reden / Rede von Bundespräsident Horst Köhler beim Arbeitgeberforum "Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft" in Berlin|website=www.bundespraesident.de|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>

During his presidency, Köhler gained a reputation for regularly voicing his opinion on foreign policy matters. He called for "globalization with a human face" and became a strong advocate of poverty eradication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Reden/EN/HorstKoehler/Reden/2005/05/20050505_Rede.html|title=www.bundespraesident.de: Der Bundespräsident / Speeches / Citation by Federal President Horst Köhler on the occasion of the award of the International Charlemagne Prize to President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi of Italy|website=www.bundespraesident.de|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Already in his inaugural speech, Köhler set his focus on a "fair partnership with Africa" which he described as a question of European self-respect:

<blockquote>"In my view, the humanity of our world can be measured against the fate of Africa. Do Europe's self-respect, its foundations, values and history, not require it to play an honest and generous role in Africa?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Reden/EN/HorstKoehler/Reden/2004/07/20040701_Rede.html|title=www.bundespraesident.de: Der Bundespräsident / Speeches / Inaugural Address by President Horst Köhler to the German Bundestag 1 July 2004|website=www.bundespraesident.de|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref></blockquote>

Throughout his six years as President, Köhler "worked hard to put Africa on the top of Germany's political agenda", according to ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/future-of-koehlers-african-projects-uncertain-after-resignation/a-5640987|title=Future of Koehler's African projects uncertain after resignation {{!}} DW {{!}} 02.06.2010|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> One of his trademark projects was the Partnership with Africa initiative, which brought together heads of state, entrepreneurs, intellectuals and students from Africa and Europe to create a "dialogue of equals".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/future-of-koehlers-african-projects-uncertain-after-resignation/a-5640987|title=Future of Koehler's African projects uncertain after resignation {{!}} DW {{!}} 02.06.2010|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Through unapologetic criticism of both Europe's negligence of the African continent and of sensitive issues in African politics, including corruption, Köhler gained wide popularity across Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/future-of-koehlers-african-projects-uncertain-after-resignation/a-5640987|title=Future of Koehler's African projects uncertain after resignation {{!}} DW {{!}} 02.06.2010|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>

On the eve of his resignation, Köhler presented his book ''Schicksal Afrika'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13386240/Warum-Horst-Koehler-nicht-mehr-Praesident-sein-wollte.html|title=Flucht aus dem Amt: Warum Horst Köhler nicht mehr Präsident sein wollte|last=Sturm|first=Daniel Friedrich|date=2011-05-22|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> an edited volume on the continent's future with contributions from 41 authors, including former African Presidents [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[John Kufuor]] as well as Nobel Prize Literature Laureate [[Wole Soyinka]].

By the summer of 2005, he was Germany's most popular political figure, with an approval rating of 72 percent, according to a poll published in ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.<ref>[[Mark Landler]] (July 4, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/04/world/europe/suddenly-in-the-limelight-the-president-of-germany.html Suddenly, in the Limelight, the President of Germany] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In July 2005, he dissolved the Bundestag at Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s request, after the latter had lost a [[motion of confidence]] in the Bundestag. This led to early election for the Bundestag in September 2005.

In August 2005, Köhler attended the memorial ceremony for [[Brother Roger]], the founder of the [[Taizé Community]], an ecumenical [[monasticism|monastic]] community in [[Burgundy]].<ref>John Tagliabue (August 24, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/world/europe/at-his-funeral-brother-roger-has-an-ecumenical-dream-fulfilled.html At His Funeral, Brother Roger Has an Ecumenical Dream Fulfilled] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

[[File:Horst Köhler in Brackenheim am 31. Januar 2009.jpg|thumb|Horst Köhler in [[Brackenheim]] after unveiling a bronze statue of [[Theodor Heuss]]]]
In October 2006, Köhler made a far-reaching decision by vetoing the bill which would transfer Germany's Air Safety Administration [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] into private ownership. The [[Bundestag]] passed this legislation but as President, Köhler was authorized not to sign it into law if, in his opinion, it contravened the constitution. In December 2006 he did not sign the Consumer Information Law (which intended to make information collected by public food safety agencies available to consumers), because the constitution does not allow the federal government to instruct municipal authorities. This can only be done by the German states. There had only been six previous occasions when Germany's president had chosen to reject bills, in most instances less important legislation had been involved. His vetoes were the first notable examples in recent German history.

In March 2007, Köhler turned down a politically contentious request for [[clemency]] by [[Christian Klar]], a terrorist from the far-left [[Red Army Faction]]. His meeting with Klar had drawn protests from conservative politicians, who said Klar had shown no remorse for his crimes. The president also denied clemency to another member, [[Birgit Hogefeld]].<ref>[[Mark Landler]] (March 5, 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/world/europe/08briefs-terrorism.html Germany: No Pardons For 2 In Terrorism Gang] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In his 2007 Christmas address to the nation, Köhler urged the government to push ahead more quickly with reforms. He was also critical of the introduction of the [[minimum wage]] in the postal sector (which had led to the loss of 1,000 jobs at ''[[Deutsche Post]]'' rival [[PIN Group]]), stating that "a minimum wage that cannot be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs".<ref name="German President criticises minimum wages">''Stuttgarter Zeitung'', 29 December 2007 (German)</ref>

On 22 May 2008, Köhler announced his candidacy for a second term as president. On 23 May 2009 he was re-elected by the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Federal Assembly]],<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|title=German president wins re-election|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 May 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8065167.stm|accessdate=23 May 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081201194141/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8065167.stm|archive-date=1 December 2008}}</ref> and was sworn into office for a second term on 1 July 2009.
