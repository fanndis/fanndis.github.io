'''Jenna Louise Hawkins Welch''' (July 24, 1919 – May 10, 2019) was the mother of [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]].

==Biography==
Welch was born in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], She is the daughter of Halsey Sinclair Hawkins (1894–1982) and Jessie Laura Sherrard (1898–1981). She grew up in [[El Paso, Texas]].

She married the late [[Harold Welch]] on January 29, 1944, and moved to [[Midland, Texas]] with him. Their only child, Laura Lane Welch, wife of [[George W. Bush]], was born on November 4, 1946. Her granddaughter, [[Jenna Bush|Jenna Welch Bush]], was named after her.

Jenna worked as [[bookkeeper]] of Harold's home building company from their residence in [[Midland, Texas]]. 

In 2002, on a trip to [[West Virginia]], George W. Bush seemed to suggest that an epiphany involving Welch had prompted him to turn against the Enron Corporation and Kenneth L. Lay, its chief executive and his largest single contributor, whom he called "Kenny Boy".

==Breast cancer patient==
Hawkins was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997 at the age of 78.  She had surgery and has been cancer-free since. Her daughter, [[Laura Bush]], has become a breast cancer activist in honor of her mother.<ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030312-8.html</ref>
