{{Hatnote|For the NHS in the UK as a whole see [[National Health Service]]. This article is only about its part functioning in Scotland.}}
'''NHS Scotland''', sometimes styled '''NHSScotland''', is the [[Publicly-funded health care|publicly funded healthcare system]] in [[Scotland]], and one of the four systems which make up the [[National Health Service]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It operates fourteen territorial NHS boards across Scotland, seven special non-geographic health boards and [[NHS Health Scotland]]. 

At the founding of the [[National Health Service]] in the United Kingdom, three separate institutions were created in Scotland, [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The NHS in Scotland was accountable to the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] rather than the [[Secretary of State for Health]] as in England and Wales. Prior to 1948, a publicly funded healthcare system, the [[Highlands and Islands Medical Service]], had been established in Scotland in 1913, recognising the geographical and demographic challenges of delivering healthcare in that region. 

Following [[History of Scottish devolution|Scottish devolution]] in 1999, [[Healthcare in Scotland|health]] and [[Social care in Scotland|social care]] policy and funding became devolved to the [[Scottish Parliament]]. It is currently administered through the [[Health and Social Care Directorates]] of the [[Scottish Government]].

The current [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport]] is [[Jeane Freeman]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/cabinet-secretary-health-and-sport/|title=Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport - gov.scot|website=www.gov.scot|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref> and the head of staff is the interim director-general health and social care and chief executive of NHS Scotland, Elinor Mitchell.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/about/how-government-is-run/civil-service/director-general-health-social-care/|title=Director-General Health and Social Care |website=gov.scot|publisher=[[Scottish Government]]|accessdate=3 August 2020}}</ref>

==Budget==
NHS Scotland had an operating budget of [[Pound sterling|£]]15.3{{nbsp}}billion in 2020-21.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/uploads/docs/report/2016/nr_161027_nhs_overview.pdf |title=NHS in Scotland 2016 |publisher=[[Audit Scotland]] |date=October 2016 |accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref>

Health and social care are [[Reserved and excepted matters|devolved issues in the United Kingdom]] and the separate public healthcare bodies of Scotland, [[National Health Service (England)|England]] and [[NHS Wales|Wales]] are each commonly referred to as "[[National Health Service]]". The NHS in Scotland was created as an administratively separate organisation in 1948 under the ministerial oversight of the [[Scottish Office]], before being politically devolved in 1999. This separation of powers and financing is not always apparent to the general public due to the co-ordination and co-operation where [[Anglo-Scottish border|cross-border]] emergency care is involved.

==Workforce==
Approximately 160,000 staff work across 14 regional NHS Boards, seven Special NHS Boards and one public health body,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Health/About/NHS-Scotland |title=About Us: NHSScotland |publisher= Scottish Government |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref> More than 12,000 of these healthcare staff are engaged under independent contractor arrangements. Descriptions of staff numbers can be expressed as headcount and by Whole-Time Equivalent (WTE) which is an estimate that helps to take account of full and part-time work patterns.

Scotland's healthcare workforce includes:
* around 67,000 [[nursing|nurses]], [[midwives]] and [[health visitor]]s (providing around 58,000 WTE)
* over 4,900 [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]]s (providing around 4600 WTE)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://isdscotland.scot.nhs.uk/Health-Topics/Workforce/Publications/2014-02-25/2014-02-25-Workforce-Report.pdf |title=NHS Scotland Workforce Data as at 31 December 2013 |publisher= ISD Scotland |date=25 February 2014 |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>

==Origins and history==
===Before 1948===
Prior to the creation of NHS in Scotland in 1948, the state was involved with the provision of healthcare, though it was not universal. Half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by the [[Highlands and Islands Medical Service]], a state-funded health system run directly from Edinburgh, which had been set up 35 years earlier to address a deficiency in the [[National Insurance Act 1911|panel system]], which required workers who earned less than £160 per year to pay [[Penny_(British_pre-decimal_coin)|4d]] per week.  Fourpence per week was beyond the means of most crofters at the time, who were subsistence farmers but often provided many troops for British armed forces. Average crofting families' income in some areas could be as low as £26 per annum (10/- or 120d per week) or even lower<ref>http://www.elib.scot.nhs.uk/Upload/Dewar_Report.pdf</ref>. The additional challenges of delivering medical care in the sparsely populated highlands and islands with poor infrastructure were also funded by the Highlands and Islands Medical Service. 

During the Second World War, the [[Emergency Hospital Service (Scotland)]] built many hospitals intended to treat wartime casualties and injuries. These hospitals initially lay idle and so the Scottish Secretary at the time decided to use the hospital capacity to reduce long waiting lists for treatment.

Scotland also had its own distinctive medical tradition, centred on its medical schools rather than private practice, and a detailed plan for the future of health provision based on the Cathcart report.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ournhsscotland.com/history/birth-nhsscotland |title=Birth of NHS Scotland: What made Scotland different?|publisher= Our NHS Scotland |accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref>

===Development of a National Health Service===
Following the publication of the [[Beveridge Report]] in 1942, the [[UK Government]] responded with a [[white paper]], ''A National Health Service'' ([[command paper|Cmd.]] 6502) in 1944 led by the Conservative MP and Minister for Health [[Henry Willink]]. In its introduction, the white paper laid out the Government's intention to have the new health service operate in Scotland--

:''"The decision to establish the new service applies, of course, to Scotland as well as to England and Wales and the present Paper is concerned with both countries. The differing circumstances of Scotland are bound to involve certain differences of method and of organisation, although not of scope or of object ... Throughout the Paper references to the Minister should normally be construed as references to the Minister of Health in the case of England and Wales and the Secretary of State for Scotland in the case of Scotland."''

===Founding of the NHS in Scotland===
The [[UK Parliament]] passed the [[National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947]], which came into effect on 5 July 1948.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JmpAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hJgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3821%2C3368487 |title=New Health Service Begins Today. 400 Hospitals Taken Over in Scotland |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=5 July 1948 |page=2 |accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref> This foundational legislation has since been superseded. 

This Act provided a uniform national structure for services which had previously been provided by a combination of the [[Highlands and Islands Medical Service]], local government, charities and private organisations which in general was only free for emergency use. The new system was funded from central taxation and did not generally involve a charge at the time of use for services concerned with existing medical conditions or vaccinations carried out as a matter of general public health requirements; prescription charges were a later introduction in 1951.

==Structure==
Current provision of healthcare is the responsibility of fourteen geographically based local NHS boards, seven national special health boards and many small contractors for primary care services. Hospitals, district nursing services and healthcare planning are managed by health boards. Government policy has been to use the [[Golden Jubilee National Hospital|National Waiting Times centre]] to address waiting lists and limit use of the private sector.

===Primary Care===
To have access to NHS services, patients should register with a [[General Practice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mygov.scot/register-with-doctor/overview/ |title=Health, social care and wellbeing > Guide > Register with a doctor |website=www.mygov.scot |publisher=Scottish Government |date=19 September 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2020}}</ref> Most often this will be an independent contractor who has agreed to provide [[general medical services]] to patients, funded on a capitation basis- with weighting given for the age distribution, poverty, and rurality. Various services are provided free of charge by [[General Practitioner]]s (GPs), who are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive medical record, usually affording some continuity of care. There is no option to self-refer to specialists in Scotland unlike many European countries.  GP surgeries consist of partner GPs who are responsible for running the practice, and may include GPs employed by the practice and paid a salary, but who do not have any responsibility in running the surgery. In some instances, GPs are directly employed by the local health board, such as in parts of the Highlands and Islands.

The NHS in Scotland also covers [[NHS dentistry|dentistry]] for patients who have registered with a dentist who has agreed to provide services to NHS patients.  Most dentists in Scotland have a mixture of NHS patients and [[private medicine in the United Kingdom|private patients]].  Check-ups are free, however dentists charge patients a regulated fee. Patients in Scotland must pay up to 80% of the total cost of the treatment unless they qualify for free treatment or help with costs. Dentists are remunerated through a voucher towards treatment and patients can choose to have more expensive treatments if they are willing and able to do so. This is mostly commonly seen with [[dental amalgam]] restorations on molars, which are available on the NHS, whereas [[dental composite|composite resin]] restorations are not.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/hcs-1-entitled-help-health-costs/pages/2/ |title=Help with health costs (HCS1): information booklet - November 2018 |publisher=Scottish Government |date=23 November 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2020}}</ref> The patient 'opts-out' of the NHS treatment and pays for the composite restoration as temporary private patient, but remains an NHS patient for future checkups.

[[Pharmacy (shop)|Community pharmacies]] in Scotland also provide prescribed medicines free of charge, where the patient is registered with a GP Surgery based in Scotland, and where the appropriate prescription-voucher is given.  Like GPs, they are private providers deliver NHS services under contract. Pharmacists are increasingly delivering services which were once the responsibilities of GPs, such as flu vaccinations as well as offering advice on skin problems, gastrointestinal problems and other minor illnesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhsinform.scot/care-support-and-rights/nhs-services/pharmacy/nhs-pharmacy-first-scotland|title=Pharmacy services in Scotland|website=www.nhsinform.scot}}</ref> Pharmacies in Scotland are frequently located inside Chemists' shops and supermarkets. While there are no [[prescription charges]] in Scotland, prescription-vouchers are not ordinarily given in Scotland for certain medicines - such as [[acetominophen]] and [[ibuprofen]] - as these are available without a prescription at very low prices in most chemists and supermarkets.
 
Most [[Optometrists]] in Scotland also provide NHS services, and provide [[eye_examination|eye examinations]], which includes retinal health checks and other eye screening services in addition to sight tests. Entitlements are mainly for corrective lenses and a predetermined set of frames - which were once known as 'NHS glasses' which attracted some social stigma<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.college-optometrists.org/the-college/museum/online-exhibitions/virtual-spectacles-gallery/nhs-spectacles.html|title=NHS Spectacles|first=Neil|last=Handley|website=www.college-optometrists.org}}</ref> until the range of frames was extended.

===Secondary Care===
Hospital services are delivered directly by the National Health Service in Scotland. Since devolution, Scottish healthcare policy has been to move away from market-based solutions and towards direct delivery, rather than using the private or voluntary sectors. Proposals for the establishment of fifteen NHS boards were announced by the [[Scottish Executive Health Department]] in December 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/158732/0043081.pdf |title=Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change |publisher=Scottish Executive Health Department |date=December 2000|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> Further details about the role and function of the unified NHS health boards were provided in May 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/158768/0043099.pdf |title=Rebuilding our National Health Service |publisher=Scottish Executive Health Department |date=May 2001 |accessdate=11 Aug 2014}}</ref> From 1 October 2001 each geographical health board area had a single NHS board that was responsible for improving health and health services across their local area, replacing the previous decision-making structures of 43 separate boards and trusts.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/2001/10/320 |title=New chapter for NHS - Health Minister |publisher=Scottish Executive Health Department |date=1 October 2001 |accessdate=18 July 2015}}</ref>

In April 2004, Scotland's health care system became an integrated service under the management of NHS boards. Local authority nominees were added to board membership to improve co-ordination of health and [[Social care in Scotland|social care]]. The remaining 16 Trusts were dissolved from 1 April 2004.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/2004/04/5329 |title=Dissolution of NHS Trusts |publisher=Scottish Executive Health Department |date=1 April 2004 |accessdate=18 July 2015}}</ref> [[List of hospitals in Scotland|Hospitals]] are now managed by the [[Acute care|acute]] division of the NHS board. [[Primary care]] services such as GPs and pharmacies would continue to be contracted through the NHS board, but from 2004 were considered part of the remit of [[Community Health Partnership]]s (CHPs), structures based largely on [[Subdivisions of Scotland|local authority boundaries]] and including local authority membership of their boards. By April 2014, there were new joint working arrangements in place between the NHS boards and local authorities came into effect that also included responsibility for social care. There new organisations, which took over from CHPs are called [[Health and Social Care Partnership]]s (HSCPs).

[[NHS Argyll and Clyde]] now no longer operates. Its responsibilities were shared between NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow on 1 April 2006, and the latter was renamed NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The part of the NHS Argyll and Clyde area which transferred to NHS Highland corresponds to the Argyll and Bute council area. 

===Elections to non-executive positions on health boards===

In January 2008, the [[Scottish Government]] announced plans for legislation to bring in direct elections as a way to select people for non-executive positions on health boards.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7176874.stm |title=Health Board elections outlined |work=BBC News |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> The Health Committee of the Scottish Parliament had supported plans for directly elected members as a way that might improve public representation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/newsandmediacentre/26098.aspx |title=Press release: Health Committee supports introduction of Health Board elections |work=Scottish Parliament |date=10 January 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>

===Special health boards===
Local health boards are supported by a number of national special health boards providing national services (some of which have further publicised subdivisions), including:

*[[Public Health Scotland]]<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/|title=Public Health Scotland |publisher=Public Health Scotland.com |accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref> (Public health (including national health protection) and health education from April 2020)
*[[Healthcare Improvement Scotland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhshealthquality.org |title=NHS Quality Improvement Scotland |publisher=Nhshealthquality.org |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref>
*[[Scottish Ambulance Service]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishambulance.com |title=Scottish Ambulance Service |publisher=Scottishambulance.com |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref> (The single public emergency ambulance service in Scotland)
*The [[Golden Jubilee National Hospital]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gjnh.scot.nhs.uk |title=Golden Jubilee National Hospital |publisher=Gjnh.scot.nhs.uk |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref> is a special NHS Board in Scotland with the purpose of reducing waiting times using a single modern hospital located at Clydebank. It was previously a private sector hospital built at a cost of £180 million, but was bought in 2002 by the Scottish Executive for £37.5 million after it failed to produce a profit despite being established with the help of a subsidy provided by a previous government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scottish.parliament.uk |title=(Scottish Parliament Official Report 20 June 2002) |publisher=Scottish.parliament.uk |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605164909/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/ |archive-date=5 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
*The [[State Hospitals Board for Scotland]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/tsh/ |title=State Hospitals Board for Scotland |publisher=Show.scot.nhs.uk |accessdate=2010-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230115224/http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/tsh/ |archive-date=30 December 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> is responsible for the secure psychiatric hospital at Carstairs, which provides high security services for mentally disordered offenders and others who pose a high risk to themselves or others.
*[[NHS 24]] runs a telephone advice and triage service that cover the out of hours period, more recently also providing a national telehealth service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs24.com/Explained/Services |title=NHS 24 Explained |publisher=NHS 24 |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref>

*[[NHS National Services Scotland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsnss.org |title=NHS National Services Scotland |publisher=Nhsnss.org |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref> It is the common name for the Common Services Agency (CSA) providing services for NHS Scotland boards.

[[NHS Health Scotland]], [[Health Protection Scotland]] and [[Information Services Division]] were succeeded by [[Public Health Scotland]] in April 2020. This new agency is a collaborative approach by both the [[Scottish Government]] and [[Convention of Scottish Local Authorities|COSLA]] as a result of the Public Health Reform Programme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publichealthreform.scot/public-health-scotland/about-public-health-scotland/public-health-scotland-overview|title=Public Health Scotland overview|last=Reform|first=Public Health|website=publichealthreform.scot|language=en|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>

===Links with the NHS in England===

The NHS in Scotland does have some services provided by the NHS in England - such as [[NHS Business Services Authority]], which processes the payment of dental, optical and pharmacy vouchers and negotiates with pharmaceutical suppliers to negotiate prices per-item down. The costs for the medicines consumed is borne by the health board that patient's GP surgery is based in. Some very complex, low volume, highly-specialist hospital services are also provided by NHS Trusts in England, such as the [[Hospital for Tropical Diseases]] in London. These Trusts  also treat patients from healthcare systems outside the UK.

===Representative Bodies===

The [[Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland]] is an independent statutory body which protects people with a psychological disorder who are not able to look after their own interests. It is funded through the Scottish Government Health & Social Care Directorate, and follows the same financial framework as the NHS in Scotland.

The '''Scottish Health Council''' took over from local Health Councils on 31 March 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishhealthcouncil.org |title=Scottish Health Council |publisher=Scottish Health Council |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref>

=== Quality of Healthcare ===

Regulation of most medical practitioners is a reserved matter, with doctors regulated by the [[General Medical Council]] of the United Kingdom, Nurses by the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]], Dentists by the [[General Dental Council]], Optometrists by the [[General Optical Council]], pharmacists by the [[General Pharmaceutical Council]], and [[allied health professions|allied health professionals]] by the [[Health and Care Professions Council]].  

Inspection of premises is undertaken by [[Healthcare Environment Inspectorate]] and the [[Care_Inspectorate_(Scotland)|Care Inspectorate]].

There are separate institutions, independent of government such as [[Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties in Scotland]], the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]], the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], and the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]] which are distinct from their counterparts elsewhere in the United Kingdom which support professionals in Scotland.

===Other divisions===

Other subdivisions of the Scottish NHS include:-

[[Health Protection Scotland]] (Part of [[NHS National Services Scotland]] responsible for health protection until April 2020 with the establishment of [[Public Health Scotland]])

[[Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service]]

==Central Register==
{{main|National Health Service Central Register}}
The Central Register keeps records of patients resident in Scotland who have been registered with any of the health systems of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/national-health-service-central-register/about-the-register/index.html |title=National Health Service Central Register: About the Register |publisher=General Registrar Office for Scotland |date=28 October 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326215718/http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/national-health-service-central-register/about-the-register/index.html |archive-date=26 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is maintained by the [[Registrar General for Scotland|Registrar General]]. Its purposes include keeping GPs' patient lists up to date, the control of new NHS numbers issued in Scotland and assisting with medical research.

===Patient identification===
Scottish patients are identified using a ten-digit number known as the '''[[Community Health Index (Scotland)|CHI Number]]'''.<ref>{{cite web
  | title = National Committee Services: CHI Advisory Group: About Us
  | work = Scottish Health Service Centre
  | publisher = NHS National Services Scotland
  | year = 2008
  | url = http://www.chiadvisorygroup.scot.nhs.uk/
  | accessdate = 2008-11-30}}</ref> These are used to uniquely identify individuals, avoiding problems such as where health records of people with similar birth dates and names may be confused, or where ambiguously spelled or abbreviated names may lead to one patient having several different health records. In addition, CHI numbers are quoted in all clinical correspondence to ensure that there is no uncertainty over the patient in question. A similar system of NHS reference numbers has since been instituted by NHS England and Wales.

==Recent developments==
In 2000, the NHS boards were starting to help out researchers with their studies. The [[Scottish Dental Practice Board]], for example, was helping out a study which looked at the significance of orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. The SDPB shared 128 subjects with these researchers for analysis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kerr|first=W. J. S|title=Orthodontic Treatment with Fixed Appliances in the General Dental Service in Scotland|journal=Journal of Orthodontics|date=June 2000|volume=27|issue=2|pages=175–180|url=http://jorthod.maneyjournals.org/content/27/2/175.full|accessdate=5 April 2014}}</ref>

[[Prescription charges]] were abolished in Scotland in 2011.  [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]] defended the abolition in 2017 saying that restoring the charge would be a [[false economy]], "Given that it costs on average £4,500 per week to keep patients in an acute hospital in Scotland, it's actually cheaper to keep them at home and give them the drugs to prevent them going into hospital."<ref>{{cite news|title=Free prescriptions 'save NHS money' despite bill for ageing and obesity|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/health/15576253.Free_prescriptions__save_NHS_money__despite_bill_for_ageing_and_obesity/|accessdate=6 October 2017|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=5 October 2017}}</ref>

===Initiatives===
The [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/19/contents|title=National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990}}</ref> introduced GP fundholding for certain elective procedures on a voluntary basis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gponline.com/nhs-70-general-practice-1991-2018/article/1485693|title=The NHS at 70: General practice 1991 to 2018}}</ref>. Fundholding gave GPs [[Power_of_the_purse|significant influence]] over Trusts' decision making as a significant source of funding. GP Fundholding was subsequently abolished with the function transferring to Primary Care Trusts in 1998. 

In 2001, [[NHS 24]], was established to provide advice and triage services for patients outside of the 'core hours' of 08:00 – 18:30 on any working day. They can also advise of pharmacy opening hours.

In 2002, the Scottish Parliament Acted to introduce free personal care for over 65s in [[Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002]]

The Scottish Parliament Acted to abolished Primary Care Trusts in the [[National Health Service Reform (Scotland) Act 2004]], which abolished the [[NHS internal market|internal market]] in Scotland and replaced NHS Trusts with 15 territorial health boards. In 2004, GPs were no longer required to provide out of hours services unless they opted into doing so.<ref>{{Cite web|date=30 March 2004|title=STANDARD GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICES CONTRACT{{!}}NHS Circular: PCA(M)(2004)7|url=https://www.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/pca/PCA2004(M)07.pdf|website=scot.nhs.uk}}</ref>  

In 2005, an plan for improving oral health and modernising dental practices was put into place, known as 'Childsmile', which provides preventive care such as proper brushing technique, tooth varnish and dietary advice. This has resulted in 60% of children in Scotland having no obvious signs of tooth decay.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 2005|title=An Action Plan for Improving Oral Health and Modernising NHS Dental Services in Scotland|url=https://www2.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/37428/0012526.pdf|access-date=27 September 2020|website=Scottish Executive}}</ref>

An incentive programme for GPs was established in 2004, known as the [[Quality and Outcomes Framework]] (QOF) were introduced in order to reward and incentivize good practice and provided a way for GP surgeries to increase their income. This was abolished in Scotland in 2015<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.gov.scot/news/scotland-first-to-abolish-bureaucratic-system-of-gp-payments|title=Scotland first to abolish bureaucratic system of GP payments|website=Scottish Government News}}</ref> as QOF compliance was a significant administrative burden for GPs. The Scottish Government and the [[British Medical Association]] agreed the ''2018 Scottish General Medical Services Contract'' that came in to force 1 April 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Services/Primary-Care/GP-Contract|title=The GP Contract|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|date=2017-02-06|website=www2.gov.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref>

In 2008, the Scottish Government introduced the Scottish Patient Safety Programme, which aimed to reduced [[iatrogenic illness]] by changing the safety culture to be more in line with the aviation industry, by providing clinicians with skills in improvement methodology and root cause analysis.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dayan|first=Mark|last2=Edwards|first2=Nigel|date=July 2017|title=Research Report: Learning from Scotland’s NHS|url=https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/files/2017-07/learning-from-scotland-s-nhs-final.pdf|access-date=27 September 2020|website=nuffieldtrust.org.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-improvement-journey-nationwide-approach-improvement-compiled-2016-17/pages/4/|title=The Scottish Improvement Journey: a nationwide approach to improvement|website=www.gov.scot}}</ref>

==Performance==
In 2014 the [[Nuffield Trust]] and the [[Health Foundation]] produced a report comparing the performance of the NHS in the four countries of the UK since devolution in 1999. They included data for the North East of England as an area more similar to the devolved areas than the rest of England. They found that there was little evidence that any one country was moving ahead of the others consistently across the available indicators of performance. There had been improvements in all four countries in life expectancy and in rates of mortality amenable to health care.  Despite the hotly contested policy differences between the four countries there was little evidence, where there was comparable data, of any significant differences in outcomes. The authors also complained about the increasingly limited set of comparable data on the four health systems of the UK.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bevan|first1=Gwyn|last2=Mays|first2=Nicholas|title=The four health systems of the UK: How do they compare?|url=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/compare-UK-health|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=Nuffield Trust|date=11 April 2014}}</ref>

In 2014/2015 more than 7,500 NHS patients were treated in private hospitals in order to meet waiting times targets.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHS spends millions in private sector despite SNP 'clampdown'|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/nhs-spends-millions-in-private-sector-despite-snp-clampdown.122998224|accessdate=13 July 2015|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=18 April 2015}}</ref>

Dr Peter Bennie, of the [[British Medical Association]], attacked the decision to release weekly reports on the Accident and Emergency 4 hour wait target in June 2015. In June 2015 92.2% of patients were admitted or discharged within 4 hours against a target of 95%. He said "The publication of these weekly statistics completely misses the point and diverts attention from the real issues in our health service."<ref>{{cite news|title=BMA Scotland criticises NHS waiting times 'obsession'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-33262824|accessdate=27 June 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=25 June 2015}}</ref>

The [[Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties in Scotland]] produced a report entitled "Learning from serious failings in care" in July 2015. The investigation was launched after concerns about  high death rates and staffing problems at [[Monklands Hospital]], a [[Clostridium difficile colitis|clostridium difficile]] outbreak at the [[Vale of Leven Hospital]] and concerns about patient safety and care at [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]]. The report found the problems had been predominantly caused by the failure of clinical staff and NHS management to work together.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHS accused of ‘systemic failings’|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/health/nhs-accused-of-systemic-failings-1-3827264|accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Edinburgh News|date=10 July 2015}}</ref> They found leadership and accountability were often lacking but bullying was endemic. Their  20 recommendations for improvements in the NHS included a set of minimum safe staffing levels for consultants, doctors, nurses and other staff in hospital settings. They criticised a target driven culture, saying:  "Quality care must become the primary influence on patient experience... and the primary indicator of performance."<ref>{{cite news|title=Report warns patients put at risk by failings in NHS|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/health/report-warns-patients-put-at-risk-by-failings-in-nhs.1436509461|accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=10 July 2015}}</ref>

In January 2017 the [[British Medical Association]] said that the health service in Scotland was "stretched pretty much to breaking point" and needed an increase in funding of at least 4% "just to stand still".<ref>{{cite news|title=BMA: Scotland's NHS is stretched to 'breaking point'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38628343|accessdate=15 January 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=15 January 2017}}</ref> The service missed seven out of eight performance targets in 2016/7.  There was a 99% increase in the number of people waiting more than 12 weeks for an outpatient appointment.  Drug-related deaths were the highest in the European Union.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patients in Scotland waiting longer as NHS misses seven out of ten performance targets|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20203834.article?|accessdate=25 December 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=2 November 2017}}</ref>

==Anglo-Scottish Border issues==
The divergent administration of the NHS between England and Scotland has created problems for patients who live close to the border. The [[Coldstream]] medical practice has about 1400 patients who live in England. They benefit from the Scottish free prescriptions because they are "deemed to be in the Scottish healthcare system" so long as they are delivered through a Scottish pharmacy. However, there has been no agreement about the reimbursement of hospital charges for patients who cross the border for hospital treatment. In 2013  633 Northumberland patients crossed into Scotland for treatment at the [[Borders General Hospital]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Scottish independence vote threatens seamless healthcare on the border|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/02/scottish-independence-healthcare-english-nhs-reforms|accessdate=13 July 2015|work=The Guardian|date=2 September 2014}}</ref>

[[University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]] complained in June 2015 that commissioners outside England use a "burdensome" prior approval process, where a funding agreement is needed before each stage of treatment.  At the end of 2014–15 the trust was owed more than £2.3m for treating patients from outside England. A survey by the [[Health Service Journal]] suggested there was £21m of outstanding debt relating to patients from the devolved nations treated in the last three years, against total invoicing of £315m by English [[NHS trust]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=English trust to take hard line on payments for Scottish, Welsh and Irish patients|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/acute-trusts/university-college-london-hospitals-nhs-foundation-trust/english-trust-to-take-hard-line-on-payments-for-scottish-welsh-and-irish-patients/5085496.article#.Va6WKNBIgYA|accessdate=21 July 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=4 June 2015}}</ref>  Funding was approved for 625 referrals outside Scotland in 2016/17, up from 427 in 2013/14. The cost rose from £11.9 million in 2013/14 to £15.2 million in 2016/17.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rise in NHS patients being sent outwith Scotland for specialist treatment|url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/scotland/rise-in-nhs-patients-being-sent-outwith-scotland-for-specialist-treatment/|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=Evening Express|date=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230085017/https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/scotland/rise-in-nhs-patients-being-sent-outwith-scotland-for-specialist-treatment/|archive-date=30 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Overseas patients==
Patients who are not entitled to free NHS treatment because they are not [[Ordinarily resident status|ordinarily resident]] in the UK are supposed to pay for their treatment.  Not all of this money is collected.  £347,089 was owed to NHS Lothian by 28 patients in 2016/7, compared with £47,755 owed by fewer than five patients the previous year.  In Greater Glasgow and Clyde the number of overseas patients treated rose from 67 in 2014/15 to 99. A total of £423,326 is owed to the health board and about £1.2 million across Scotland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Overseas patients fail to pay £1.2m bill for NHS treatment|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/overseas-patients-fail-to-pay-1-2m-bill-for-nhs-treatment-1-4647372|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=26 December 2017}}</ref>
