Hughes was elected to parliament as member for [[Ōtaki (New Zealand electorate)|Otaki]] in the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 general election]], standing for the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]. For the next six years he was New Zealand's youngest MP.<ref name="early">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10714576|title=Hughes sought career in politics from early age|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=24 March 2011|first=Claire|last=Trevett}}</ref> In [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]], he was re-elected with the country's smallest majority, 382.<ref>[http://2005.electionresults.govt.nz/electoratestatus.html Electorate results, 2005 elections.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425152328/http://2005.electionresults.govt.nz/electoratestatus.html |date=25 April 2009 }}</ref>

As a local MP, Hughes had a strong record of delivering for the communities in the Otaki constituency. One example was Horowhenua Health Centre in Levin which opened in 2007. The $16 million facility was one of Hughes' proudest achievements. He also organised a local campaign to save the centre when it was threatened by budget cuts in 2010.<ref>http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/3407681/Community-rallies-to-save-health-centre</ref>

===Voting record===
Hughes voted in favour of a law allowing same sex [[Civil Unions in New Zealand|civil unions]] and the decriminalisation of [[prostitution]], but against a [[euthanasia|Death with Dignity law]].

===Party responsibilities and ministerial positions===
Hughes was his party's junior whip and a Member of the Officers of Parliament Select Committee. In November 2007, as a part of the fifth Labour government's final reshuffle, Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] made him a Minister outside Cabinet with the [[Statistics New Zealand|Statistics]] portfolio. He was also made the associate minister for [[Ministry of Social Development (New Zealand)|Social Development and Employment]]. He also served as deputy [[Leader of the House (New Zealand)|Leader of the House]]. As a government minister and member of the [[Executive Council of New Zealand|Executive Council]], Hughes is able to use the title "[[the Honourable]]" for life.<ref>https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/our-programmes/new-zealand-royal-honours/new-zealand-royal-honours-system/types-new-zealand-royal-honours/the-honourable/roll-of-the-honourables</ref>

==In opposition (2008–2011)==
In the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]] the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] defeated Labour. Hughes lost his Otaki seat to [[Nathan Guy]] but, being listed by Labour at 19, returned to Parliament as a [[list MP]]. Opposition Leader [[Phil Goff]] appointed him Transport Spokesperson. He was also made the opposition's senior whip.

On 15 June 2010, as part of a shadow-cabinet reshuffle, Hughes became the Spokesperson for Infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|title=Goff reshuffles Labour deck|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/goff-reshuffles-labour-deck-3588611|accessdate=1 June 2011|work=TVNZ|date=15 June 2010}}</ref> Later, he was also given the Education portfolio and served as Shadow Leader of the House from 2009 to 2011.

In 2010, Darren Hughes submitted a [[Private member's bill|private members' bill]] to lower the [[Drunk driving law by country#New Zealand|drink driving limit]] to 0.05 (its full name was the Land Transport (Safer Alcohol Limits for Driving) Amendment Bill). The bill was his response to an earlier government decision to not lower the limit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10664923|title=Big majority for lower alcohol limit|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=10 August 2010|first=Beck|last=Vass}}</ref> It was placed on the ballot in June, August and November, but not drawn.<ref>[http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/Ballot/9/b/b/49HOOOCBallot201008051-Members-bills-ballot-Thursday-5-August-2010.htm New Zealand Parliament Members' bills ballot - 5 August 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/Ballot/5/4/8/49HOOOCBallot201009091-Members-bills-ballot-Thursday-9-September-2010.htm New Zealand Parliament Members' bills ballot - 9 September 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/Ballot/8/0/f/49HOOOCBallot201011111-Member-s-bill-ballot-Thursday-11-November-2010.htm New Zealand Parliament Members' bills ballot - 11 November 2010]</ref> According to the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' at the time, Hughes "…drafted his legislation only after the Government decided not to lower the limit. But, commendably, he has been careful not to make it an exercise in points-scoring." Hughes was quoted as saying he wanted politicians to "put aside their party differences and work together on issues of road safety".<ref name="nzherald">{{cite web |title=Editorial: Drink-drive bill chance to act decisively - Opinion - NZ Herald News |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=10665114 |website=nzherald.co.nz |accessdate=7 May 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811122633/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=10665114 |archive-date=11 August 2010 |url-status=live |location=New Zealand |date=11 August 2010}}</ref>

==Police investigation and resignation==
Hughes's time as an MP ended abruptly in March 2011 after a young man laid a police complaint of a sexual nature against him. The complaint concerned events that occurred on 2 March. Shortly after the complaint became public, and while the police were still investigating, Hughes resigned from Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10716428&ref=rss |title=Hughes resigns from Parliament |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2011 |work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref> His resignation was announced on 25 March and effective from 5 April.<ref name="resig"/><ref name="resigdate"/> [[Louisa Wall]] replaced him as a Labour list MP.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10717554|title=Louisa Wall back in Parliament|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=6 April 2011}}</ref>

On 8 June the Police confirmed that they would not lay any charges against Hughes.<ref name="NoCharge">{{cite news|title=No charges against former Labour MP Darren Hughes|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5116263/No-charges-against-former-Labour-MP-Darren-Hughes|accessdate=8 June 2011|work=stuff.co.nz|date=8 June 2011}}</ref>

===Sequence of events===
On 23 March 2011 Hughes confirmed that he was "being investigated by police after an alleged late night incident."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/darren-hughes-confirms-he-mp-in-alleged-late-night-incident-4079259|title=Darren Hughes confirms he is MP in alleged late-night incident|publisher=TVNZ|date=23 March 2011}}</ref> This announcement was designed to end speculation surrounding his Labour party colleagues.

Hughes denied any wrongdoing but later offered to resign from Parliament. Labour leader [[Phil Goff]], who had known about the complaint for two weeks,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/71622/goff-facing-more-questions-over-hughes-affair|title=Goff facing more questions over Hughes affair|publisher=Radio New Zealand|date=30 March 2011}}</ref> initially refused the resignation<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Darren-Hughes-resignation-declined-by-Goff/tabid/419/articleID/203958/Default.aspx|title=Darren Hughes resignation declined by Goff|publisher=3 News|date=25 March 2011}}</ref> but changed his mind a day later. Goff announced Hughes' resignation on 25 March 2011.<ref name="resig">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10714938|title=MP Darren Hughes to resign|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=25 March 2011|first=Claire|last=Trevett}}</ref>

On the same day Hughes released another statement which in part said:

<blockquote>"My position as an MP has become untenable. In order to be able to exercise my basic rights as a citizen, it is necessary for me to resign as a Member of Parliament. I have informed Phil Goff of my decision.

Although people are commonly [[Presumption of innocence|thought to be innocent until proven guilty]], it has become clear to me that this doesn't apply in the political arena.

I have done nothing wrong, and I remain confident that the legal process will have the right outcome.

My immediate focus is on clearing my name. I will continue to co-operate fully with the police inquiry ..."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nz.news.yahoo.com/a/-/latest/9076884/full-text-for-hughes-statement/ |title=Full text for Hughes' statement |publisher=NewstalkZB |date=25 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823130152/http://nz.news.yahoo.com/a/-/latest/9076884/full-text-for-hughes-statement/ |archivedate=23 August 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

Speaker of the House [[Lockwood Smith]] confirmed Hughes's resignation on 1 April and it took effect on 5 April 2011.<ref name="resigdate">{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/4836517/Darren-Hughes-resignation-official|title=Darren Hughes' resignation official|publisher=stuff.co.nz (Fairfax Media)|date=1 April 2011}}</ref>

Over three months after the original incident, on 8 June, the Police announced that they did not have enough evidence to press charges against Hughes. They also revealed that an anonymous letter containing allegations against Hughes had been sent to "some media outlets". They had investigated these allegations but "there were no matters which arose that required police attention".<ref name=NoCharge />

===Reallocation of portfolios===
The roles that Hughes had filled for the Labour opposition went to [[Sue Moroney]], [[David Shearer]] and [[Rick Barker]]. Moroney took over the education portfolio, with specific responsibility for primary and secondary schooling, and joined the party's front bench. Shearer took over the tertiary education portfolio and Barker became the new senior whip.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10717232|title=Moroney, Shearer and Barker take on Darren Hughes roles|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=5 April 2011|first=Claire|last=Trevett}}</ref>

===Replacement by Louisa Wall (as MP) and Peter Foster (as Otaki candidate)===
Because he had been elected through the party list rather than by an electorate, Hughes' seat passed down Labour's party list to [[Louisa Wall]] without a by-election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/promising-political-career-in-tatters-4087524|title=Promising political career in tatters|publisher=TVNZ|date=25 March 2011}}</ref> There were five people listed before Wall who could have taken the seat, but they all stood aside. (Wall, unlike the others, was due to stand for Labour in the [[2011 New Zealand general election|general election]] later that year.)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/louisa-wall-becomes-new-labour-mp-4101634|title=Louisa Wall becomes new Labour MP|publisher=TVNZ|date=5 April 2011}}</ref> The five were all former MPs, listed at numbers 38-42: [[Judith Tizard]] (number 38),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/4842249/Judith-Tizard-not-returning-to-Parliament|title=Judith Tizard not returning to Parliament|publisher=stuff.co.nz (Fairfax Media)|date=3 April 2011}}</ref> [[Mark Burton]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1104/S00039/list-vacancy-in-parliament-mark-burton.htm|title=List vacancy in Parliament - Mark Burton (press release)|publisher=scoop.co.nz|date=3 April 1011}}</ref> [[Mahara Okeroa]], [[Martin Gallagher]] and [[Dave Hereora]] (42).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0808/S00518.htm|title=Labour Party list for 2008 election announced (Labour Party press release, includes full list)|publisher=scoop.co.nz|date=31 August 2011}}</ref>

With Hughes not running for re-election, Labour named Raumati lawyer Peter Foster as their Otaki electorate candidate for 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Labour selects Otaki candidate|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10724079|accessdate=11 May 2011|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=7 May 2011}}</ref>
