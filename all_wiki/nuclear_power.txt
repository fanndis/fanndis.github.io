'''Nuclear power''' is the use of [[nuclear reaction]]s that release [[Nuclear binding energy|nuclear energy]] to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in [[steam turbine]]s to produce [[electricity]] in a [[nuclear power plant]]. Nuclear power can be obtained from [[nuclear fission]], [[nuclear decay]] and [[nuclear fusion]] reactions. Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s. Generating electricity from [[fusion power]] remains at the focus of international research. This article mostly deals with nuclear fission power for electricity generation.

Civilian nuclear power supplied 2,563 [[terawatt hour]]s (TWh) of electricity in 2018, equivalent to about 10% of [[World energy consumption#Electricity generation|global electricity generation]], and was the second largest [[low-carbon power]] source after [[hydroelectricity]].<ref name="pris-supplied">{{cite web|url=https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/WorldTrendinElectricalProduction.aspx |title=Trend in Electricity Supplied |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref><ref name="IEA2019">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2019/may/steep-decline-in-nuclear-power-would-threaten-energy-security-and-climate-goals.html|title=Steep decline in nuclear power would threaten energy security and climate goals|publisher=International Energy Agency|date=2019-05-28|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref> {{As of|2019|12|post=,}} there are [[List of nuclear reactors|443 civilian fission reactors in the world]], with a combined electrical capacity of 395 [[gigawatt]] (GW).

Nuclear power has one of the lowest levels of fatalities per unit of energy generated compared to other energy sources. Coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydroelectricity each have caused more fatalities per unit of energy due to air pollution and [[Energy accidents|accidents]].<ref name="MarkandyaWilkinson2007" /> Since its commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power has prevented about 1.84 million [[air pollution]]-related deaths and the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.<ref name="Kharecha Pushker A 2013 4889–4895">{{cite journal | last1=Kharecha | first1=Pushker A. | last2=Hansen | first2=James E. |title=Prevented Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Historical and Projected Nuclear Power |doi=10.1021/es3051197 |pmid=23495839 |bibcode = 2013EnST...47.4889K |volume=47 |issue=9 |journal=Environmental Science & Technology |pages=4889–4895 |year=2013 |doi-access=free }}</ref> 

[[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|Accidents in nuclear power plants]] include the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the Soviet Union in 1986, the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in Japan in 2011, and the more contained [[Three Mile Island accident]] in the United States in 1979.

There is a [[Nuclear power debate|debate about nuclear power]]. Proponents, such as the [[World Nuclear Association]] and [[Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy]], contend that nuclear power is a safe, sustainable energy source that reduces [[carbon emissions]]. [[Anti-nuclear movement|Nuclear power opponents]], such as [[Greenpeace]] and [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service|NIRS]], contend that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment.

[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|The [[nuclear binding energy]] of all natural elements in the periodic table. Higher values translate into more tightly bound nuclei and greater nuclear stability. [[Iron]] (Fe) is the end product of [[nucleosynthesis]] within the core of [[hydrogen]] fusing stars. The elements surrounding iron are the [[fission products]] of the fissionable [[actinides]] (e.g. uranium). Except for iron, all other elemental nuclei have in theory the potential to be nuclear fuel, and the greater distance from iron the greater [[nuclear potential energy]] that could be released.]]

In 1932, physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered that when lithium atoms were "split" by protons from a proton accelerator, immense amounts of energy were released in accordance with the principle of [[mass–energy equivalence]]. However, he and other nuclear physics pioneers [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Albert Einstein]] believed harnessing the power of the atom for practical purposes anytime in the near future was unlikely.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rhodes |title=Making of the Atomic Bomb |page=228}}</ref> The same year, Rutherford's doctoral student [[James Chadwick]] [[Discovery of the neutron|discovered the neutron]].<ref>{{cite news |title=80 years since discovery of the neutron |url=https://phys.org/news/2012-06-years-discovery-neutron.html |work=Phys.org | date=June 15, 2012}}</ref> Experiments bombarding materials with neutrons led [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frédéric]] and [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] to discover [[induced radioactivity]] in 1934, which allowed the creation of [[radium]]-like elements.<ref>{{cite conference |title=Predicting Induced Radioactivity at High Energy Accelerators |first1=Alberto |last1=Fassò |first2=Marco  |last2=Silari |first3=Luisa  |last3=Ulrici |publisher=[[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]], [[Stanford University]] |place=Stanford, CA |date=October 1999 |url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-8215.pdf |id=SLAC-PUB-8215 |conference=Ninth International Conference on Radiation Shielding, Tsukuba, Japan, October 17–22, 1999 |access-date=December 10, 2018}}</ref> Further work by [[Enrico Fermi]] in the 1930s focused on using [[slow neutron]]s to increase the effectiveness of induced radioactivity.

They determined that the relatively tiny neutron split the nucleus of the massive uranium atoms into two roughly equal pieces, contradicting Fermi.<ref name="Np" /> This was an extremely surprising result; all other forms of [[nuclear decay]] involved only small changes to the mass of the nucleus, whereas this process—dubbed "fission" as a [[binary fission|reference to biology]]—involved a complete rupture of the nucleus. Numerous scientists, including [[Leó Szilárd]], who was one of the first, recognized that if fission reactions released additional neutrons, a self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] could result.<ref>[http://alexwellerstein.com/atomic_patents/ https://web.archive.org/web/20160310165547/http://alexwellerstein.com/atomic_patents/]</ref><ref name="Inside the Atomic Patent Office">{{cite journal | doi = 10.2968/064002008 | volume=64 | issue=2 | title=Inside the atomic patent office | year=2008 | journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | pages=26–31 | last1 = Wellerstein | first1 = Alex| bibcode=2008BuAtS..64b..26W }}</ref> Once this was experimentally confirmed and announced by Frédéric Joliot-Curie in 1939, scientists in many countries (including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union) petitioned their governments for support of nuclear fission research, just on the cusp of [[World War II]], for the development of a [[nuclear weapon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/mp/introduction.shtml |title=The Einstein Letter |publisher=Atomicarchive.com |access-date=2013-06-22}}</ref>

=== First nuclear reactor ===
In the United States, where Fermi and Szilárd had both emigrated, the discovery of the nuclear chain reaction led to the creation of the first man-made reactor, the [[research reactor]] known as [[Chicago Pile-1]], which achieved [[Criticality (status)|criticality]] on December 2, 1942. The reactor's development was part of the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. It led to the building of larger single-purpose [[production reactor]]s, such as the [[X-10 Pile]], for the production of [[weapons-grade plutonium]] for use in the first nuclear weapons. The United States tested the first nuclear weapon in July 1945, the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]], with the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] taking place one month later.

[[File:First four nuclear lit bulbs.jpeg|thumb|left|The first light bulbs ever lit by electricity generated by nuclear power at [[EBR-1]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory]]-West, December 20, 1951.<ref>[https://www.ne.anl.gov/About/modern-day-alchemy/ Argonne's Nuclear Science and Technology Legacy, Reactors: Modern-Day Alchemy]</ref> As the first [[liquid metal cooled reactor]], it demonstrated Fermi's [[breeder reactor]] principle to maximize the energy obtainable from [[natural uranium]], which at that time was considered scarce.<ref>[https://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/frt.shtml Fast Reactor Technology. EBR-I (Experimental Breeder Reactor-I)]</ref>]]

In August 1945, the first widely distributed account of nuclear energy, the pocketbook ''The Atomic Age'', was released. It discussed the peaceful future uses of nuclear energy and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused. Nobel laureate [[Glenn Seaborg]], who later chaired the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], is quoted as saying "there will be nuclear powered earth-to-moon shuttles, nuclear powered artificial hearts, plutonium heated swimming pools for SCUBA divers, and much more".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wendt |first1=Gerald |last2=Geddes |first2=Donald Porter |title=The Atomic Age Opens |date=1945 |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |url=http://alsos.wlu.edu/information.aspx?id=279}}</ref>

In the same month, with the end of the war, Seaborg and others would file hundreds of initially classified [[patent]]s,<ref name="Inside the Atomic Patent Office"/> most notably [[Eugene Wigner]] and [[Alvin Weinberg]]'s Patent #2,736,696, on a conceptual [[light water reactor]] (LWR) that would later become the United States' primary reactor for [[naval propulsion]] and later take up the greatest share of the commercial fission-electric landscape.<ref>{{cite web |title=The USS ''Seawolf'' Sodium Cooled Reactor Submarine |url=http://www.ans.org/about/officers/docs/seawolf_sfr_sea_story_051712.pdf|date=May 17, 2012}}Lecture by Eric P.

Electricity was generated for the first time by a nuclear reactor on December 20, 1951, at the [[EBR-I]] experimental station near [[Arco, Idaho]], which initially produced about 100&nbsp;[[kW]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/frt.shtml |title=Reactors Designed by Argonne National Laboratory: Fast Reactor Technology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory |year=2012 |access-date=2012-07-25}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January#v=onepage&q&f=true "Reactor Makes Electricity."] ''Popular Mechanics'', March 1952, p. 105.</ref>
In 1953, American President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] gave his "[[Atoms for Peace]]" speech at the United Nations, emphasizing the need to develop "peaceful" uses of nuclear power quickly. This was followed by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] which allowed rapid declassification of U.S. reactor technology and encouraged development by the private sector.

The total global installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly, rising from less than 1 [[gigawatt]] (GW) in 1960 to 100 GW in the late 1970s, and 300 GW in the late 1980s. Since the late 1980s worldwide capacity has risen much more slowly, reaching 366 GW in 2005. Between around 1970 and 1990, more than 50 GW of capacity was under construction (peaking at over 150 GW in the late 1970s and early 1980s)—in 2005, around 25 GW of new capacity was planned. More than two-thirds of all nuclear plants ordered after January 1970 were eventually cancelled.<ref name="iaeapdf">{{cite web |url= http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC48/Documents/gc48inf-4_ftn3.pdf |title=50 Years of Nuclear Energy |access-date=2006-11-09 |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency }}</ref> A total of [[List of canceled nuclear plants in the United States|63 nuclear units were canceled]] in the United States between 1975 and 1980.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=C5W8uxwMqdUC&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=%22nuclear+power+industry%22+history+u.s.

In 1972 Alvin Weinberg, co-inventor of the light water reactor design (the most common nuclear reactors today) was fired from his job at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] by the [[Nixon administration]], "at least in part" over his raising of concerns about the safety and wisdom of ever larger scaling-up of his design, especially above a power rating of ~500 MW<sub>e</sub>, as in a [[loss of coolant accident]] scenario, the [[decay heat]] generated from such large compact solid-fuel cores was thought to be beyond the capabilities of passive/natural [[convection]] cooling to prevent a rapid fuel rod melt-down and resulting in then, potential far reaching [[fission product]] pluming.

=== Regulations, pricing and accidents ===
In the early 1970s, the increased public hostility to nuclear power in the United States lead the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] and later the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] to lengthen the license procurement process, tighten engineering regulations and increase the requirements for safety equipment.<ref name="phyast.pitt.edu">[http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter9.html Costs of Nuclear Power Plants – What Went Wrong?]</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nuclear-energy-may-soon-be-free-from-its-tangled-regulatory-web nuclear energy may soon be free from its tangled regulatory web. ''Washington Examiner'']</ref> Together with relatively minor percentage increases in the total quantity of steel, piping, cabling and concrete per unit of installed [[nameplate capacity]], the more notable changes to the regulatory open [[public hearing]]-response cycle for the granting of construction licenses, had the effect of what was once an initial 16 months for project initiation to the pouring of first concrete in 1967, escalating to 32 months in 1972 and finally 54 months in 1980, which ultimately, quadrupled the price of power reactors.<ref>[http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter9.html Costs of Nuclear Power Plants – What went Wrong?]</ref><ref>[https://fhr.nuc.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/05-001-A_Material_input.pdf Per Peterson ''Metal And Concrete Inputs For Several Nuclear Power Plants''.]</ref>

Among American engineers, the cost increases from implementing the regulatory changes that resulted from the TMI accident were, when eventually finalized, only a few percent of total construction costs for new reactors, primarily relating to the prevention of safety systems from being turned off.

In 1982, amongst a backdrop of ongoing protests directed at the construction of the first commercial scale [[breeder reactor]] in France, a later member of the [[Green Party of Switzerland|Swiss Green Party]] fired five [[RPG-7]] [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s at the still under construction [[containment building]] of the [[Superphenix]] reactor. Two grenades hit and caused minor damage to the reinforced concrete outer shell. It was the first time protests reached such heights. After examination of the superficial damage, the prototype fast breeder reactor started and operated for over a decade.<ref>https://www.sciencemag.org/content/215/4533/641.1.citation{{subscription required}}</ref>

According to some commentators, the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] played a major part in the reduction in the number of new plant constructions in many other countries:<ref name=wolfgang/>
Unlike the Three Mile Island accident the much more serious Chernobyl accident did not increase regulations or engineering changes affecting Western reactors; because the [[RBMK]] design, which lacks safety features such as "robust" [[containment building]]s, was only used in the Soviet Union.<ref name="NRC">{{cite web |url= https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/chernobyl-bg.html |title=Backgrounder on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident |website=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] | access-date = 2006-06-28}}</ref> Over 10 RBMK reactors are still in use today. However, changes were made in both the RBMK reactors themselves (use of a safer enrichment of uranium) and in the control system (preventing safety systems being disabled), amongst other things, to reduce the possibility of a similar accident.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf31.html |title=RBMK Reactors &#124; reactor bolshoy moshchnosty kanalny &#124; Positive void coefficient |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date=2009-09-07 |access-date=2013-06-14}}</ref>  Russia now largely relies upon, builds and exports a variant of the PWR, the [[VVER]], with [[Nuclear power in Russia|over 20 in use today]].

An international organization to promote safety awareness and the professional development of operators in nuclear facilities, the [[World Association of Nuclear Operators]] (WANO), was created as a direct outcome of the 1986 Chernobyl accident. The organization was created with the intent to share and grow the adoption of nuclear safety culture, technology and community, where before there was an atmosphere of [[cold war]] secrecy.

Numerous countries, including Austria (1978), Sweden (1980) and Italy (1987) (influenced by Chernobyl) have voted in referendums to oppose or phase out nuclear power.

In the early 2000s, the nuclear industry was expecting a nuclear renaissance, an increase in the construction of new reactors, due to concerns about carbon dioxide emissions.<ref name=":1" /> However, in 2009, Petteri Tiippana, the director of [[Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority|STUK's]] nuclear power plant division, told the [[BBC]] that it was difficult to deliver a [[Generation III reactor]] project on schedule because builders were not used to working to the exacting standards required on nuclear construction sites, since so few new reactors had been built in recent years.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8379274.stm | title = New UK nuclear stations unlikely to be ready on time | date = 25 November 2009 | publisher = [[BBC]] | last = Jones | first = Meirion | access-date = 10 December 2018}}</ref>

In 2018 the [[MIT]] Energy Initiative study on the future of nuclear energy concluded that, together with the strong suggestion that government should financially support development and demonstration of new Generation IV nuclear technologies, for a worldwide renaissance to commence, a global standardization of regulations needs to take place, with a move towards serial manufacturing of standardized units akin to the other complex engineering field of aircraft and aviation. At present it is common for each country to demand [[bespoke]] changes to the design to satisfy varying national regulatory bodies, often to the benefit of domestic engineering supply firms. The report goes on to note that the most cost-effective projects have been built with multiple (up to six) reactors per site using a standardized design, with the same component suppliers and construction crews working on each unit, in a continuous work flow.<ref>[https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/mapping-what-it-would-take-for-a-renaissance-for-nuclear-energy/ Mapping what it would take for a renaissance for nuclear energy]</ref>

=== Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster ===
{{Main|Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster}}
{{See also|Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant}}
Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]] on 11 March 2011, one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, and a subsequent tsunami off the coast of Japan, the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] suffered three core meltdowns due to failure of the emergency cooling system for lack of electricity supply. This resulted in the most serious nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident prompted a re-examination of [[nuclear safety]] and [[nuclear energy policy]] in many countries<ref name=sciamer2011 /> and raised questions among some commentators over the future of the renaissance.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-13/nuclear-renaissance-threatened-as-japan-fights-meltdown-at-quake-hit-plant.html Nuclear Renaissance Threatened as Japan’s Reactor Struggles] Bloomberg, published March 2011, accessed 2011-03-14</ref><ref name=":1">[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/14/us-japan-quake-nuclear-analysis-idUSTRE72C41W20110314 Analysis: Nuclear renaissance could fizzle after Japan quake] Reuters, published 2011-03-14, accessed 2011-03-14</ref>

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident sparked controversy about the importance of the accident and its effect on nuclear's future.
The crisis prompted countries with nuclear power to review the safety of their reactor fleet and reconsider the speed and scale of planned nuclear expansions.<ref name="Platts">{{cite web |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/6925550 |title=News Analysis: Japan crisis puts global nuclear expansion in doubt |date=2011-03-21 |publisher=Platts}}</ref>
In 2011, ''The Economist'' opined that nuclear power "looks dangerous, unpopular, expensive and risky", and suggested a [[nuclear phase-out]].<ref name=econ2011>{{cite news |date=2011-03-24 |title=Nuclear power: When the steam clears |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |work=The Economist}}</ref>

The ''[[Associated Press]]'' and [[Reuters]] reported in 2011 the suggestion that the safety and survival of the younger [[Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant]], the closest reactor facility to the [[epicenter]] and on the coast, demonstrate that it is possible for nuclear facilities to withstand the greatest natural disasters.

By 2015, the IAEA's outlook for nuclear energy had become more promising.
"Nuclear power is a critical element in limiting greenhouse gas emissions," the agency noted, and "the prospects for nuclear energy remain positive in the medium to long term despite a negative impact in some countries in the aftermath of the [Fukushima-Daiichi] accident...it is still the second-largest source worldwide of low-carbon electricity.

In 2016 the [[BN-800]] sodium cooled [[fast reactor]] in Russia, began commercial electricity generation, while plans for a [[BN-1200]] were initially conceived the future of the fast reactor program in Russia awaits the results from MBIR, an under construction multi-loop Generation research facility for testing the chemically more inert lead, lead-[[bismuth]] and [[gas cooled fast reactor|gas coolants]], it will similarly run on recycled [[MOX]] (mixed uranium and plutonium oxide) fuel. An on-site [[pyroprocessing|pyrochemical processing]], closed fuel-cycle facility, is planned, to recycle the spent fuel/"waste" and reduce the necessity for a growth in uranium mining and exploration. In 2017 the manufacture program for the reactor commenced with the facility open to collaboration under the "International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycle", it has a construction schedule, that includes an operational start in 2020.

== Nuclear power station ==
[[File:PWR nuclear power plant animation.webm|thumb|thumbtime=2|An animation of a [[Pressurized water reactor]] in operation.]]
{{Main|Nuclear power station}}
{{See also|List of nuclear reactors}}
Just as many conventional [[thermal power station]]s generate electricity by harnessing the [[thermal energy]] released from burning [[fossil fuels]], nuclear power plants convert the energy released from the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an atom via [[nuclear fission]] that takes place in a nuclear reactor. When a [[neutron]] hits the nucleus of a [[uranium-235]] or [[plutonium]] atom, it can split the nucleus into two smaller nuclei. The reaction is called nuclear fission. The fission reaction releases energy and neutrons. The released neutrons can hit other uranium or plutonium nuclei, causing new fission reactions, which release more energy and more neutrons. This is called a [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]]. The reaction rate is controlled by [[control rod]]s that absorb excess neutrons. The controllability of nuclear reactors depends on the fact that a small fraction of neutrons resulting from fission are [[Delayed neutron|delayed]]. The time delay between the fission and the release of the neutrons slows down changes in reaction rates and gives time for moving the control rods to adjust the reaction rate.<ref name=WNAnuclearreactorbasics>{{cite web |title=How does a nuclear reactor make electricity? |publisher= World Nuclear Association |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/nuclear-basics/how-does-a-nuclear-reactor-make-electricity.aspx |website=www.world-nuclear.org |access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/atomic-age-began-75-years-ago-with-the-first-controlled-nuclear-chain-reaction/|title=Atomic age began 75 years ago with the first controlled nuclear chain reaction|last1=Spyrou|first1=Artemis|date=2017-12-03|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-11-18|last2=Mittig|first2=Wolfgang}}</ref>

A fission nuclear power plant is generally composed of a [[nuclear reactor]], in which the nuclear reactions generating heat take place; a cooling system, which removes the heat from inside the reactor; a [[steam turbine]], which transforms the heat in [[mechanical energy]]; an [[electric generator]], which transform the mechanical energy into electrical energy.<ref name=WNAnuclearreactorbasics />

== Life cycle of nuclear fuel ==
[[File:Nuclear Fuel Cycle.png|thumb|The nuclear fuel cycle begins when uranium is mined, enriched, and manufactured into nuclear fuel, (1) which is delivered to a [[nuclear power plant]]. After usage in the power plant, the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant (2) or to a final repository (3) for geological disposition. In [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] 95% of spent fuel can potentially be recycled to be returned to usage in a power plant (4).]]

{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle|Integrated Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System}}

The life cycle of nuclear fuel starts with [[Uranium mining]], which can be underground, [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]], or [[in-situ leach]] mining, an increasing number of the highest output mines are remote underground operations, such as [[McArthur River uranium mine]], in Canada, which by itself accounts for 13% of global production. The [[uranium ore]], now independent from the ore body is then, as is shared in common with other metal mining, converted into a compact [[ore concentrate]] form, known in the case of uranium as "[[yellowcake]]"(U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) to facilitate transport.

In reactors that can sustain the [[neutron economy]] with the use of graphite or heavy water moderators, the reactor fuel can be this natural uranium on reducing to the much denser black ceramic oxide (UO<sub>2</sub>) form. For light water reactors, the fuel for which requires a further isotopic refining, the yellowcake is converted to the only suitable [[monoatomic]] uranium molecule, that is a gas just above room temperature, [[uranium hexafluoride]], which is then sent through [[uranium enrichment|gaseous enrichment]]. In civilian light water reactors, Uranium is typically enriched to 3-5% [[uranium-235]], and then generally converted back into a black powdered ceramic [[uranium oxide]](UO<sub>2</sub>) form, that is then compressively [[sintered]] into [[Fuel rod#Common physical forms of nuclear fuel|fuel pellets, a stack of which forms fuel rods]] of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is needed in.

In modern light-water reactors the fuel rods will typically spend 3 operational cycles (about 6 years) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of the uranium has been fissioned.  Afterwards, they will be moved to a [[spent fuel pool]] which provides cooling for the thermal heat and shielding for ionizing radiation. Depending largely upon [[burnup]] efficiency, after about 5 years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle, and can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.

Some proposed reactor designs, such as the American [[Integral Fast Reactor]] and the [[Molten salt reactor]] can more completely use or [[burnup]] the spent [[reactor grade plutonium]] fuel and other minor actinides, generated from light water reactors, as under the designed [[fast fission]] spectrum, these elements are more likely to fission and produce the aforementioned fission products in their place. This offers a potentially more attractive alternative to deep geological disposal.<ref>{{cite news|author=Duncan Clark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/09/nuclear-waste-burning-reactor |title=Nuclear waste-burning reactor moves a step closer to reality &#124; Environment &#124; guardian.co.uk |newspaper=Guardian |date=2012-07-09 |access-date=2013-06-14 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2011/12/05/a-waste-of-waste/ |author=George Monbiot |title= A Waste of Waste |publisher=Monbiot.com |access-date=2013-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZR0UKxNPh8 |title=Energy From Thorium: A Nuclear Waste Burning Liquid Salt Thorium Reactor |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-23 |access-date=2013-06-14}}</ref>

The [[thorium fuel cycle]] results in similar fission products, though creates a much smaller proportion of [[Transuranium element|transuranic elements]] from [[neutron capture]] events within a reactor. Therefore, spent thorium fuel, breeding the true fuel of fissile [[uranium-233]], is somewhat less concerning from a radiotoxic and security standpoint.<ref>NWT magazine, October 2012</ref>

==== Low-level radioactive waste ====
{{See also|Low-level waste}}

The nuclear industry also produces a large volume of low-level radioactive waste in the form of contaminated items like clothing, hand tools, water purifier resins, and (upon decommissioning) the materials of which the reactor itself is built. Low-level waste can be stored on-site until radiation levels are low enough to be disposed as ordinary waste, or it can be sent to a low-level waste disposal site.<ref>{{cite web |title=NRC: Low-Level Waste |url=https://www.nrc.gov/waste/low-level-waste.html |website=www.nrc.gov |access-date=28 August 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

After the spent fuel is dissolved in molten salt, all of the recyclable [[actinides]], consisting largely of plutonium and uranium though with important minor constituents, are extracted using electrorefining/[[electrowinning]].

Most [[thermal reactor]]s run on a [[Nuclear fuel cycle#Once-through nuclear fuel cycle|once-through fuel cycle]], mainly due to the low price of fresh uranium, though many reactors are also fueled with recycled fissionable materials that remain in spent nuclear fuel.  The most common fissionable material that is recycled is the reactor-grade plutonium (''RGPu'') that is extracted from spent fuel, it is mixed with uranium oxide and fabricated into mixed-oxide or [[MOX fuel]]. The first LWR designs certified to operate on a full core of MOX fuel, the [[ABWR]] and the [[System 80]], began to appear in the 1990s.<ref>https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/tf97v1.26193.0029</ref><ref>https://www.nap.edu/read/4754/chapter/6#204</ref> The potential for recycling the spent fuel a second time is limited by undesirable [[neutron economy]] issues using second-generation MOX fuel in ''thermal''-reactors.

Because thermal LWRs remain the most common reactor worldwide, the most typical form of commercial spent fuel recycling is to recycle the plutonium a single time as MOX fuel, as is done in France, where it is considered to increase the sustainability of the nuclear fuel cycle, reduce the attractiveness of spent fuel to theft and lower the volume of high level nuclear waste.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.069|title=Assessment of the environmental footprint of nuclear energy systems.

The main constituent of spent fuel from the most common light water reactor, is uranium that is slightly more enriched than natural uranium, which can be recycled, though there is a lower incentive to do so. Most of this "recovered uranium",<ref>[http://www.ccnr.org/advanced_fuel_cycles.html CANDU Fuel Cycle Flexibility]</ref> or at times referred to as [[reprocessed uranium]], remains in storage. It can however be used in a fast reactor, used directly as fuel in [[CANDU]] reactors, or re-enriched for another cycle through an [[LWR]].

While reprocessing offers the potential recovery of up to 95% of the remaining uranium and plutonium fuel, in spent nuclear fuel and a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to [[nuclear proliferation]] and varied perceptions of increasing the vulnerability to [[nuclear terrorism]] and because of its higher fuel cost, compared to the once-through fuel cycle.<ref name=berrytoll>R.

=== Nuclear decommissioning ===
{{Main|Nuclear decommissioning}}
The financial costs of every nuclear power plant continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Once no longer economically viable, nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses, such as [[greenfield status]].
After a cooling-off period that may last decades, reactor core materials are dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for interim storage or [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] experiments.

In the United States a [[Nuclear Waste Policy Act]] and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund is legally required, with utilities banking 0.1 to 0.2 cents/kWh during operations to fund future decommissioning. They must report regularly to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) on the status of their decommissioning funds. About 70% of the total estimated cost of decommissioning all U.S. nuclear power reactors has already been collected (on the basis of the average cost of $320 million per reactor-steam turbine unit).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/decommissioning.html|title=Backgrounder on Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants.

Decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming.

Both [[Nuclear fission|fission]] and fusion appear promising for [[Spacecraft propulsion|space propulsion]] applications, generating higher mission velocities with less [[reaction mass]]. This is due to the much higher energy density of nuclear reactions: some 7 orders of magnitude (10,000,000 times) more energetic than the chemical reactions which power the current generation of rockets.

[[Radioactive decay]] has been used on a relatively small scale (few kW), mostly to power [[space mission]]s and experiments by using [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s such as those developed at [[Idaho National Laboratory#Space and Security Power Systems Facility|Idaho National Laboratory]].

The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments depend on the choice of an energy source.
Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low fuel costs.
Comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants as well as the future costs of fossil fuels and renewables as well as for energy storage solutions for intermittent power sources.
On the other hand, measures to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] [[global warming]], such as a [[carbon tax]] or [[carbon emissions trading]], may favor the economics of nuclear power.<ref>{{cite book |title=Update of the MIT 2003 Future of Nuclear Power |date=2009 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-update2009.pdf |access-date=21 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Splitting the cost |url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2009/11/12/splitting-the-cost |access-date=21 August 2018 |work=The Economist |date=12 November 2009 |language=en}}</ref>

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must also take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties.
To date all operating nuclear power plants have been developed by [[Nationalized|state-owned]] or [[Regulated market|regulated]] [[electric utility]] monopolies<ref name=ft-20100912>{{cite news |author=Ed Crooks |date=2010-09-12 |title=Nuclear: New dawn now seems limited to the east |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad15fcfe-bc71-11df-a42b-00144feab49a.html |newspaper=Financial Times |access-date=2010-09-12}}</ref>
Many countries have now liberalized the [[electricity market]] where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.<ref name=MIT-2003>{{Cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-615-12420-9 |access-date=2006-11-10 }}</ref>

Nuclear power plants, though capable of some grid-[[load following]], are typically run as much as possible to keep the cost of the generated electrical energy as low as possible, supplying mostly [[base-load]] electricity.<ref>[https://www.oecd-nea.org/nea-news/2011/29-2/nea-news-29-2-load-following-e.pdf Load-following with nuclear power plants by A.

Peer reviewed analyses of the available cost trends of nuclear power, since its inception,
show large disparity by nation, design, build rate and the establishment of familiarity in expertise.  The two nations of which data were available, which have produced reactors at a lower cost trend than prior facilities in the 2000s were India and S.Korea.<ref name=Lovering2016>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2016.01.011 |title=Historical construction costs of global nuclear power reactors |journal=Energy Policy |volume=91 |pages=371–382 |year=2016 |last1=Lovering |first1=Jessica R. |last2=Yip |first2=Arthur |last3=Nordhaus |first3=Ted |doi-access=free }}</ref> In the history of civilian reactor power, certain designs lent considerable early positive economics, over competitors, such as the [[CANDU]] which alongside, at one time, much higher realized [[capacity factor]]/reliability when compared to Gen II LWRs up to about the 1990s,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm | title=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ - Section A: CANDU Technology | access-date=2019-08-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101054647/http://nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm | archive-date=2013-11-01 | url-status=dead }}</ref> at a time when LWRs in the U.S began to utilize improved enrichment, permitting longer operation times without stoppages, the CANDU design had allowed Canada to also forego uranium enrichment facilities and due to the on-line refueling reactor design, the larger set of [[PHWR]]s of which the CANDU design is a part, continue to hold many world record positions for longest continual electricity generation, without stoppage, routinely close to and over 800 days, before maintenance checks.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Indian-reactor-breaks-operating-record |title = Indian reactor breaks operating record - World Nuclear News}}</ref> The specific record as of 2019 is held by a PHWR at [[Kaiga Atomic Power Station]], generating electricity at the [[nameplate]] rating continuously for 962 days.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indian-Designed Nuclear Reactor Breaks Record for Continuous Operation |url=https://www.powermag.com/indian-designed-nuclear-reactor-breaks-record-for-continuous-operation/ |website=POWER Magazine |access-date=28 March 2019 |date=1 February 2019}}</ref>

Nuclear reactors have three unique characteristics that affect their safety, as compared to other power plants.
Firstly, intensely [[radioactive material]]s are present in a nuclear reactor. Their release to the environment could be hazardous.
Secondly, the [[fission product]]s, which make up most of the intensely radioactive substances in the reactor, continue to generate a significant amount of [[decay heat]] even after the fission [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] has stopped. If the heat cannot be removed from the reactor, the fuel rods may overheat and release radioactive materials.
Thirdly, a [[criticality accident]] (a rapid increase of the reactor power) is possible in certain reactor designs if the chain reaction cannot be controlled.
These three characteristics have to be taken into account when designing nuclear reactors.<ref name=IAEAsafety>{{Cite web|url=https://ansn.iaea.org/ansn.org/Common/Documents/apmd/asia251p4.pdf|title=Basic principles of nuclear safety|last=Deitrich|first=L.W.|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|access-date=2018-11-18}}</ref>

All modern reactors are designed so that an uncontrolled increase of the reactor power is prevented by natural feedback mechanisms: if the temperature or the amount of steam in the reactor increases, the fission rate inherently decreases by designing in a negative [[void coefficient]] of reactivity. The chain reaction can also be manually stopped by inserting [[control rod]]s into the reactor core. [[Emergency core cooling system]]s (ECCS) can remove the decay heat from the reactor if normal cooling systems fail.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/emergency-core-cooling-systems-eccs.html|title=Emergency core cooling systems (ECCS)|date=2018-07-06|publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> If the ECCS fails, multiple physical barriers limit the release of radioactive materials to the environment even in the case of an accident. The last physical barrier is the large [[containment building]].<ref name="IAEAsafety" /> Approximately 120 reactors,<ref>[https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1224/ML12248A021.pdf NRC pdf on generations of FCVSs]</ref> such as all those in Switzerland prior to and all reactors in Japan after the Fukushima accident, incorporate [[Filtered Containment Venting System]]s, onto the containment structure, which are designed to relieve the containment pressure during an accident by releasing gases to the environment while retaining most of the fission products in the filter structures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/publications/11190/severe-accident-mitigation-through-improvements-in-filtered-containment-vent-systems-and-containment-cooling-strategies-for-water-cooled-reactors|title=Severe accident mitigation through improvements in filtered containment vent systems and containment cooling strategies for water cooled reactors|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|date=2017|access-date=2019-08-03}}</ref>

Some serious [[nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll|nuclear and radiation accidents]] have occurred.
The severity of nuclear accidents is generally classified using the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES) introduced by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).
The scale ranks anomalous events or accidents on a scale from 0 (a deviation from normal operation that poses no safety risk) to 7 (a major accident with widespread effects).
There have been 3 accidents of level 5 or higher in the civilian nuclear power industry, two of which, the [[Chernobyl accident]] and the [[Fukushima accident]], are ranked at level 7.

[[International Atomic Energy Agency]].</ref> and the [[Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act|Price-Anderson Act]] in the United States.
It is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity; but the cost is small, amounting to about 0.1% of the [[levelized cost of electricity]], according to a CBO study.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/05-02-nuclear.pdf Nuclear Power's Role in Generating Electricity] [[Congressional Budget Office]], May 2008.</ref>
These beyond-regular-insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power, as [[hydroelectric power]] plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the [[Banqiao Dam]] disaster, where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died, or large [[dam failure]]s in general. As private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios, major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state.<ref>[http://www.damsafety.org/media/Documents/FEMA/AvailabilityOfDamInsurance.pdf Availability of Dam Insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108185336/http://www.damsafety.org/media/documents/fema/availabilityofdaminsurance.pdf|date=2016-01-08}} 1999</ref>

Forced evacuation from a nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, even suicide.
Such was the outcome of the 1986 [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] in Ukraine.
A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that "the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date".<ref name=riv12>{{cite news |author=Andrew C.

A 2015 report in ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' explained that serious impacts of nuclear accidents were often not directly attributable to radiation exposure, but rather social and psychological effects.

=== Attacks and sabotage ===
{{Main|Vulnerability of nuclear plants to attack|Nuclear terrorism|Nuclear safety in the United States}}
Terrorists could target [[nuclear power plant]]s in an attempt to release [[radioactive contamination]] into the community. The United States 9/11 Commission has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]. An attack on a reactor's [[spent fuel pool]] could also be serious, as these pools are less protected than the reactor core. The release of radioactivity could lead to thousands of near-term deaths and greater numbers of long-term fatalities.<ref name=fas12>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/pubs/_docs/Nuclear_Energy_Report-lowres.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power in the United States |author1=Charles D.

In the United States, the NRC carries out "Force on Force" (FOF) exercises at all nuclear power plant sites at least once every three years.<ref name=fas12 />
In the United States, plants are surrounded by a double row of tall fences which are electronically monitored.
The plant grounds are patrolled by a sizeable force of armed guards.<ref>[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/security-enhancements.html U.S. NRC: "Nuclear Security – Five Years After 9/11"]. Accessed 23 July 2007</ref>

Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they can be used to make [[nuclear weapon]]s if a country chooses to do so. When this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to a nuclear weapon or a public annex to a "secret" weapons program. The concern over [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear activities]] is a case in point.<ref name=dfall2009>{{cite journal |title=Nuclear power without nuclear proliferation? |author1=Steven E.

As of April 2012 there were [[Nuclear power by country|thirty one countries]] that have civil nuclear power plants,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf01.html |title=Nuclear Power in the World Today |publisher=World-nuclear.org |access-date=2013-06-22}}</ref> of which [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nine have nuclear weapons]], with the vast majority of these [[nuclear weapons state]]s having first produced weapons, before commercial fission electricity stations.
Moreover, the re-purposing of civilian nuclear industries for military purposes would be a breach of the [[Non-proliferation treaty]], to which 190 countries adhere.

A fundamental goal for global security is to minimize the nuclear proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power.<ref name=dfall2009 />
The [[Global Nuclear Energy Partnership]] was an international effort to create a distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy would receive [[nuclear fuel]] at a discounted rate, in exchange for that nation agreeing to forgo their own indigenous develop of a uranium enrichment program.
The France-based [[Eurodif]]/''European Gaseous Diffusion Uranium Enrichment Consortium'' is a program that successfully implemented this concept, with [[Nuclear power in Spain|Spain]] and other countries without enrichment facilities buying a share of the fuel produced at the French controlled enrichment facility, but without a transfer of technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Conversion-Enrichment-and-Fabrication/Uranium-Enrichment/|title=Uranium Enrichment |publisher= World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}</ref>
Iran was an early participant from 1974, and remains a shareholder of Eurodif via [[Sofidif]].

A 2009 United Nations report said that:
<blockquote>the revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies, which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons.<ref name=bks2011>{{cite book |last=Sovacool |first=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin K.

On the other hand, power reactors can also reduce nuclear weapons arsenals when military grade nuclear materials are reprocessed to be used as fuel in nuclear power plants.

Up to 2005, the Megatons to Megawatts Program had processed $8 billion of high enriched, weapons grade uranium into [[low enriched uranium]] suitable as nuclear fuel for commercial fission reactors by diluting it with [[natural uranium]].
This corresponds to the elimination of 10,000 nuclear weapons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usec.com/news/megatons-megawatts-eliminates-equivalent-10000-nuclear-warheads |title=Megatons to Megawatts Eliminates Equivalent of 10,000 Nuclear Warheads |publisher=Usec.com |date=2005-09-21 |access-date=2013-06-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426130245/http://www.usec.com/news/megatons-megawatts-eliminates-equivalent-10000-nuclear-warheads |archive-date=2013-04-26 }}</ref>

Analysis in 2015 by professor and chair of Environmental Sustainability [[Barry Brook (scientist)|Barry W.

===Advanced fission reactor designs===

[[File:GenIVRoadmap-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Generation IV roadmap from [[Argonne National Laboratory]]]]
Current fission reactors in operation around the world are [[generation II reactor|second]] or [[generation III reactor|third generation]] systems, with most of the first-generation systems having been already retired.
Research into advanced [[generation IV reactor]] types was officially started by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals, including to improve economics, safety, proliferation resistance, natural resource utilization and the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity.
Most of these reactors differ significantly from current operating light water reactors, and are expected to be available for commercial construction after 2030.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://ossfoundation.us/projects/energy/nuclear |title=4th Generation Nuclear Power – OSS Foundation |publisher=Ossfoundation.us |access-date=2014-01-24}}</ref>

=== Hybrid nuclear fusion-fission ===
{{Main|Nuclear fusion–fission hybrid}}
Hybrid nuclear power is a proposed means of generating power by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by [[Hans Bethe]] during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion. When a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built, it has the potential to be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel, reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel, substances which cause security concerns.<ref name="hybrid">{{cite journal | author = Gerstner, E. | title = Nuclear energy: The hybrid returns | year = 2009 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 460 | issue = 7251| pages = 25–28 | pmid = 19571861|doi=10.1038/460025a| s2cid = 205047403 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090701/pdf/460025a.pdf }}</ref>

These reactions appear potentially viable, though technically quite difficult and have yet to be created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant.
Fusion power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the 1950s.

Several experimental nuclear fusion reactors and facilities exist.
The largest and most ambitious international nuclear fusion project currently in progress is [[ITER]], a large [[tokamak]] under construction in France.
ITER is planned to pave the way for commercial fusion power by demonstrating self-sustained nuclear fusion reactions with positive energy gain.
Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns.
The facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027–11 years after initially anticipated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=W Wayt Gibbs |date=2013-12-30 |title=Triple-threat method sparks hope for fusion |journal=Nature|volume=505 |issue=7481 |pages=9–10 |bibcode=2014Natur.505....9G |doi=10.1038/505009a |pmid=24380935 |doi-access=free }}</ref> A follow on commercial nuclear fusion power station, [[DEMOnstration Power Station|DEMO]], has been proposed.<ref name="ITERorg">{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |title=Beyond ITER |publisher=Information Services, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory |website=The ITER Project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107220145/http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |archive-date=2006-11-07 |access-date=2011-02-05 |url-status=dead }} – Projected fusion power timeline</ref><ref name="EFDA_Activities">{{cite web|url=http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt |title=Overview of EFDA Activities |website=www.efda.org |publisher=[[European Fusion Development Agreement]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001123645/http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt |archive-date=2006-10-01 |access-date=2006-11-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There are also suggestions for a power plant based upon a different fusion approach, that of an [[inertial fusion power plant]].

Fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable, as fission-electric power had been. However, the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and [[plasma containment]] led to projections being extended by several decades. In 2010, more than 60 years after the first attempts, commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before 2050.<ref name="ITERorg" />
