The '''Climate Change Act 2008''' (c 27) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].  The Act makes it the duty of the [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change|Secretary of State]] to ensure that the net UK carbon account for all six [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]] [[greenhouse gases]] for the year 2050 is at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline, toward [[avoiding dangerous climate change]].  The Act aims to enable the [[United Kingdom]] to become a [[low-carbon economy]] and gives ministers powers to introduce the measures necessary to achieve a range of greenhouse gas reduction targets.  An independent [[Committee on Climate Change]] has been created under the Act to provide advice to UK Government on these targets and related policies. In the act Secretary of State refers to the [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]].

==Carbon emissions target==
On 16 October 2008 [[Ed Miliband]], Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, announced that the Act would mandate an 80% cut overall in six greenhouse gases by 2050.

When first published the Government proposed that the Act would set a target of a 60% cut, excluding international aviation and shipping, a figure that had been a Government ambition for some years.  The original 60% figure was adopted based on the recommendation of the [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]], made in their June 2000 report ''Energy - The Changing Environment''.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> If adopted by other countries too, a 60% cut by 2050 was thought likely to limit atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations to no more than 550&nbsp;[[parts per million]] which, it was generally thought at the time, would probably prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 2&nbsp;°C (3.6&nbsp;°F) and so avoid the most serious [[effects of global warming|consequences of global warming]].  The Royal Commission went on to say that there should be an 80% cut by 2100, and that the 550&nbsp;ppm upper limit should be 'kept under review'.<ref>{{cite web

The Royal Commission's figures were based on a June 1996<!--not 1998, as stated in the Commission's report--> decision of the [[Council of the European Union|EU Council of Ministers]] to limit emissions to 550&nbsp;ppm, contained in their ''[[Community Strategy on Climate Change]]''.<ref>{{cite web

Stabilising [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations at 450&nbsp;ppm would only result in a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to 2&nbsp;°C, and that it would be necessary to achieve stabilisation below 400&nbsp;ppm to give a relatively high certainty of not exceeding 2&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite web

It is because of this that environmental organisations and some political parties criticised the 60% target as being insufficiently ambitious, and why they demanded greater cuts (80%-100%), as mentioned below. The exclusion of emissions from aviation and shipping, combined with forecasts for growth in these areas, also means that the net effect of the bill would actually have only been a 35-50% total cut on 1990 levels by 2050.<ref>{{cite web

==Legislative progress==
The procedure for enacting legislation in the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] sometimes involves numerous consultative and debating stages.

===Previous Bill===
The 2008 Climate Change Bill was preceded by a [[Private Member's Bill]] of the same name<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/pabills/200506/climate_change.htm|title= 2005 Climate Change Bill

===Early Day Motion===
Shortly after the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], 412 of the 646 Members of Parliament signed an [[early day motion]] calling for a Climate Change Bill to be introduced, to include a requirement for 3% annual cuts in carbon emissions.<ref>{{cite web

===Pre-Legislative Scrutiny===
The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]] announced the introduction of a Climate Change Bill in the [[Speech from the Throne|Queen's speech]], on 15 November 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,1948346,00.html|title=Climate change bill to balance environmental and energy concerns|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|date=15 November 2006|accessdate=2007-03-13 | location=London | first=James | last=Sturcke}}</ref> The draft Bill was published on 13 March 2007, but proposed five-year 'carbon budgets' rather than the annual targets many had called for.

The draft Bill was scrutinised by three parliamentary committees. A Joint Select Committee of 24 members from the House of Lords and the House of Commons, chaired by [[Lord Puttnam]], was immediately established to scrutinize the Bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/climatechange.cfm |title=Joint Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill - official website |accessdate=2007-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109071451/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/climatechange.cfm |archivedate=9 November 2007 }}</ref> The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons also carried out its own inquiry into the draft Bill, as did the Environmental Audit Committee.  These Committees received evidence from a series of interested parties between April and July and cast votes<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtclimate/170/17019.htm|title=Joint Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill First Report - FORMAL MINUTES|date=24 July 2007|accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref> on the final wording of their reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtclimate/170/17002.htm|title=Joint Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill - First Report|date=24 July 2007|accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref>

Among the critics giving evidence was [[Nigel Lawson|Lord Lawson]] who argued that the entire concept was counter-productive because humans would easily be able to adapt to the worst predictions of a 4-degree rise in temperature by the end of the century because, with an average world economic growth of 2%, they would be "seven times as well off as we are today", therefore it was not reasonable to impose a sacrifice on the "much poorer present generation".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtclimate/170/7051604.htm|title=Examination of Witnesses (Questions 32-39)|date=16 May 2007|accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref>

===Lords Debates===
The Bill was introduced to the House of Lords by the Government on 14 November 2007.<ref name="billsCC">{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/climatechangehl.html |title=Climate Change [HL] Bill - 2007-08 |accessdate=2007-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121212522/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/climatechangehl.html |archivedate=21 November 2007}}</ref> The first debate on the floor of the House (Second Reading) was held on 27 November 2007 and lasted six hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2007-11-27a.1123.4|date=27 November 2007|title=Climate Change Bill [HL] - Second Reading Debate|accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref> This was followed by eight sittings in the Committee Stage, four further sittings at Report Stage and one more for Third Reading.

One of the votes rejected a proposal by a majority of 148 to 51 to change the target for 2050 from 60% to 80% below baseline 1990 emissions on the basis that they should wait for new scientific advice from the Committee on Climate Change before changing the target from 60%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2008-02-25&number=2&house=lords&dmp=1030|title=Climate Change Bill = Target for 2050 is 60%|date=25 February 2008}}</ref>

An amendment, to remove the [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]]'s absolute duty to ensure that the 2050 target was met, and replace it with a duty to propose policies to meet the target, was narrowly defeated by 132 votes to 130 in the Third Reading in the House of Lords<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80331-0006.htm#08033118000027|title=Lords Hansard Text for 31 March 2008|publisher=Parliament}}</ref> on 31 March 2008. The bill passed to the House of Commons.

===Commons Debates===
On 8 June 2008, following the Second Reading of the Bill, only five members of the House of Commons voted against.  The five were [[Christopher Chope]], [[Philip Davies]], [[Peter Lilley]], [[Andrew Tyrie]], and [[Ann Widdecombe]].<ref>[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], "To win the battle for the consumer, Cameron must cut taxes soon", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 September 2013.</ref>

During the debate on the Third Reading on 28 October, the government rejected an opposition amendment to allow the Secretary of State to set the maximum level of carbon dioxide that may be emitted per unit of output by any generating station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081028/debtext/81028-0018.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 28 October 2008|publisher=Parliament}}</ref> After the Committee on Climate Change's advice on the level of the 2050 target was brought forward, the 2050 target was revised from 60% of 1990 carbon dioxide emissions to 80% of the six major greenhouse gas emissions at the instigation of the government. It was also agreed that the British share of aviation and shipping emissions would form part of the target, when a method of measuring these could be agreed.<ref name="FTreport">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b511d18a-a53f-11dd-b4f5-000077b07658.html|title=MPs support tough bill on CO2 reporting|publisher=Financial Times

===Political parties===
The [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] supported the concept of a bill, and proposed their own variation ahead of the Government's.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canihavethebillplease.co.uk/bill.html|title=Can I have the Bill please?|publisher=Conservative Party|accessdate=2007-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208032041/http://www.canihavethebillplease.co.uk/bill.html|archive-date=8 February 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> One of the key differences is that they were demanding annual carbon targets,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/climate_change/article2353253.ece |title=Ministers to unveil climate change bill |publisher=Independent Online Edition |date=13 March 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-13 |location=London |first1=Joe |last1=Churcher |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315220542/http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/climate_change/article2353253.ece |archivedate=15 March 2007 }}</ref> and that the Committee on Climate Change should have an enhanced role, setting targets as well as advising governments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=135501 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070617065152/http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=135501 |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 June 2007 |title=Key elements missing from draft Climate Change Bill |publisher=Conservative Party |date=13 March 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-13 }}</ref>

The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] took a similar stance to the Conservatives, and were also of the opinion that setting targets every five years would be an abdication of responsibility, because a government typically remains in power for only four years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article2352798.ece |title=Chris Huhne: We must monitor carbon targets annually |publisher=Independent Online Edition |date=13 March 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-13 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181444/http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article2352798.ece |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}</ref> They also stated that the proposed 60% cut by 2050 may not be sufficient, and that "we may well need to aim more towards about 80%".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6444145.stm|title='Binding' carbon targets proposed|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=13 March 2007|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>

A stronger response was provided by the [[Green Party of England and Wales]]. They considered that legislation provides a 'massive opportunity', but that the draft Bill was 'dangerously unambitious'. Among their demands were annual targets and an overall emission cut of 90% by 2050.<ref>{{cite web

The [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] believed that the Bill was only necessary because of a failure to devise a viable plan for other sources of energy to replace [[fossil fuel]]s. They considered that the Bill was 'deeply misguided', likely to cripple the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|economy]] and that it would destroy investment in alternative technologies. Instead they believed that the Government and Opposition 'need to be looking into proper alternatives like [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom|nuclear power]]', and that plans to invest in renewable alternative energies as [[Wind power in the United Kingdom|wind power]] and [[Energy use and conservation in the United Kingdom#Solar electricity|solar power]], as well as cutting carbon emissions by 60%, were 'unachievable and unnecessary'.<ref>{{cite web

<!-- As of a survey carried out by Gralo on March 14, 2007, there were no obvious or clear statements in favour or against the Bill or the carbon cuts on the Web sites of any of the other parties who fought the 2005 General Election - except for UKIP, below-->

===Environmental groups===
[[Friends of the Earth (EWNI)|Friends of the Earth's]] [[Big Ask Campaign]] was one of the factors that influenced the government to include the Climate Change Bill in their legislative programme.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6045680.stm|title=UK planning law on climate change|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=12 October 2006|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> The organisation demanded that the Bill should include legally binding targets for a reduction of at least 3% a year, amounting a total cut of around 80% by 2050. They considered that a 60% cut in carbon emissions by 2050 was not a sufficient contribution from developed countries to the [[Individual and political action on climate change|international action on climate change]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/draft_climate_bill_publish_13032007.html|title=Draft climate bill published|publisher= Friends of the Earth|date=13 March 2007|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>

The UK arm of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] supported the Bill, but launched its Get on Board campaign for the 2050 carbon reduction target to be raised to at least 80%, including the UK share of emissions from international aviation & shipping.  In addition, WWF-UK called for retention of the House of Lords' amendment that at least 70% of the UK's reduction should be achieved domestically (limiting to 30% the proportion of the reduction that can be achieved through purchasing 'carbon credits').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getonboard.wwf.org.uk/aboutStrengthening.php |title=Climate Change Bill - What needs strengthening |publisher=WWF-UK |date=4 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310212137/http://getonboard.wwf.org.uk/aboutStrengthening.php |archivedate=10 March 2008 }}</ref>

The other 50 or so environmental, international development and other organisations belonging to the [[Stop Climate Chaos]] coalition backed the Big Ask Campaign and shared similar views. The coalition itself criticised the Government for failing to acknowledge the 'global warming danger threshold' of 2&nbsp;°C. Taking this into account, they believed that the 2020 target should be a minimum of 30%, with an 80% target for 2050. They also considered that the Bill should include annual 3% reduction targets, cover [[aviation]] and [[shipping]] within its scope, and ban the purchase of [[carbon credit]]s from overseas, a practice which they believe exports the emissions problem elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web

The Joint Public Issues Team of the [[Baptist Union of Great Britain|Baptist]], [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist]], and [[United Reformed Church|United Reformed]] churches called for an 80% reduction in carbon emissions [by 2050], for not ignoring the contribution of air and sea travel, and for reductions of the United Kingdom's own emissions rather than relying on buying carbon credits from other countries.<ref>[http://jointpublicissues.org.uk/jpitenvironment.htm Joint Public Issues Team of the churches: briefing on the Climate Change Bill (December 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119024752/http://jointpublicissues.org.uk/jpitenvironment.htm |date=19 January 2008 }}</ref>

===Trade unions and businesses===
The [[Confederation of British Industry]], which has created its own climate change task force, welcomed the proposed Bill, stating that it combined two vital elements, long-term clarity on policy direction and flexibility in its delivery.<ref>{{cite web

==Committee on Climate Change==
The [[Committee on Climate Change]], whose powers are invested by Part 2 of the Act, was formally launched in December 2008 with [[Adair Turner, Baron Turner of Ecchinswell|Lord Adair Turner]] as its chair.  There is also an [[Adaptation Sub-Committee]] (ASC), which sets the direction for adaptation matters including independent advice on preparing for climate change.  The ASC is made up of experts from all fields of climate change, science and economics and is currently chaired by [[Baroness Brown of Cambridge]].
