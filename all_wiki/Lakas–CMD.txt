'''Lakas–CMD''' ('''Lakas–Christian Muslim Democrats''') is a [[centre-right politics|center-right]] political party in the [[Philippines]], influenced by [[Christian democracy]] and [[Islam and democracy|Islamic democracy]]. The current party originated in 2009 with the merger of the [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|original Lakas–CMD]] party with the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI); it was known as '''Lakas Kampi CMD''' until 2012. The party produced one president, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who was president when the two parties merged in 2009.

With Arroyo unable to run for a new term due to term limits, the party lost the [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010 presidential election]] with [[Gilberto Teodoro]] as its presidential nominee. The party retained its two [[Philippine Senate|senators]], both incumbents, in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|Senate election]] and became a part of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]-led majority coalition; in the [[2010 Philippine House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives election]], it won 47% of the seats contested in the district election, but most of its members were split into three groups, with many defecting to the Liberal Party, some formed the [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], and the remaining members were split into the majority and minority blocs, with its members heading the minority. On May 11, 2012, the party decided to revert to its original name and drop Arroyo's KAMPI from the coalition.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Manila Times|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/22728-lakas-drops-gmas-kampi-from-coalition |title=Lakas drops GMA's Kampi from coalition|access-date=May 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514081052/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/22728-lakas-drops-gmas-kampi-from-coalition |archive-date=May 14, 2012 }}</ref> Lakas–CMD is currently one of the parties in opposition.

==Ideology==
Lakas–CMD has always focused on economic growth and development, stronger ties with the [[United States]], creation of jobs, and strong cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of government. It is known for its advocacy of a shift from the present [[presidential system]] to a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary form of government]] through constitutional amendments and through establishing peace talks with [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] separatists and [[communism|communist]] rebels. The party democracy is distinct in its ecumenical inclusion of Muslim leaders in its political alliance.<ref name= "Centre-right" >{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCrTDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA195&|title=Southeast Asia In The New International Era|date=2016|access-date=April 19, 2017}}</ref> The party has tended to be more popular in the [[Mindanao]] provinces.

==History==
{{see also|Lakas–CMD (1991)|Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino}}

=== Arroyo administration ===
On January 16, 2008, Lakas spokesman and legal counsel [[Raul Lambino]] stated that Lakas–CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010—spokesman  in 2010. Except for Parañaque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified. But Lambino named incumbent Senators [[Ramon Revilla, Jr.]] and [[Lito Lapid]], former senator [[Ralph Recto]] and former Congressman [[Prospero Pichay]] as among those considered.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman  Inquirer.net, Lakas lists down 30 senatorial bets for 2010—spokesman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910230132/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman |date=September 10, 2012 }}</ref>

Former Speaker of the House [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] (Pangasinan −4th District) resigned his post as president of Lakas–CMD on March 10, 2008; he rejected the proposition of former president [[Fidel Ramos]] to give him the title Chairman-emeritus. The current Speaker of the House [[Prospero Nograles]] (Davao −1st District) was sworn it as the new president of Lakas–CMD party and former Speaker of the house [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] as vice president for Metro Manila affairs on the same day.

[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on June 18, 2008, confirmed the historical [[merger]] of the [[Lakas-CMD (1991)|Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats]] (Lakas–CMD) and the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) parties. Both parties adopted the "equity of the incumbent" principle, as the merger would account for almost 200 national and 8,000 local officials, amid Mrs. Arroyo's prediction of  2010 elections victory. [[Prospero Nograles]], Lakas President and Kampi Chair [[Ronaldo Puno]] signed the covenant at the [[Davao City]] regional [[caucus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news4_june19_2008|title=Manila Standard Today – Latest News in the Philippines|access-date=April 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/101994/Lakas-CMD-Kampi-merge|title=Lakas-CMD, Kampi merge|work=GMA News Online|access-date=April 19, 2015}}</ref> Former President and Lakas–CMD Chairman Emeritus [[Fidel V.

In 2011, the legislators led by [[Pablo P. Garcia]] established the neutral [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], which has many similarities with the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]]. In 2013, the party suffered its largest decline, due  to the arrest of the party's [[matriarchy|matriarch]], Gloria Arroyo; however the remaining party largely supports the [[United Nationalist Alliance]], with candidates from among its former members such as [[Migz Zubiri]], [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] and [[Mitos Magsaysay]].
