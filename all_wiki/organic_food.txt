'''Organic food''' is [[food]] produced by methods complying with the standards of [[organic farming]]. Standards vary worldwide, but organic farming features practices that cycle resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve [[biodiversity]]. Organizations regulating organic products may restrict the use of certain [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s in the farming methods used to produce such products. Organic foods typically are not processed using [[Food irradiation|irradiation]], industrial solvents, or synthetic [[food additives]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lhom/organictext.html |title=Pesticides in Organic Farming |quote=Organic foods are not necessarily pesticide-free. Organic foods are produced using only certain pesticides with specific ingredients. Organic pesticides tend to have substances like soaps, lime sulfur and [[hydrogen peroxide]] as ingredients. Not all natural substances are allowed in organic agriculture; some chemicals like arsenic, strychnine, and tobacco dust (nicotine sulfate) are prohibited.|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |access-date=2014-06-17}}</ref>

In the [[21st century]], the [[European Union]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Japan]], and many other countries require producers to obtain [[Organic certification|special certification]] to market their food as ''organic''. Although the produce of [[kitchen garden]]s may actually be organic, selling food with an organic label is regulated by governmental [[food safety]] authorities, such as the [[National Organic Program]] of the [[US Department of Agriculture]] (USDA)<ref name="USDANOP">{{cite web | title=National Organic Program | publisher=Agricultural Marketing Service, US Department of Agriculture | date=12 December 2018 | url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program | access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref> or [[European Commission]] (EC).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/organic-farming/what-is-organic-farming/organic-certification/index_en.htm|title=Organic certification|publisher=European Commission: Agriculture and Rural Development|date=2014|access-date=10 December 2014}}</ref>

From an environmental perspective, [[fertilizer|fertilizing]], [[food waste|overproduction]], and the use of [[pesticides]] in [[conventional farming]] may negatively affect [[ecosystem]]s, [[biodiversity]], [[groundwater]], and [[drinking water]] supplies. These environmental and health issues are intended to be minimized or avoided in organic farming.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lowell|first=Vicki|title=Organic FAQs|url=https://ofrf.org/research/organic-faqs/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=Organic Farming Research Foundation|language=en-US}}</ref>

Organic [[agriculture]] has a higher production costs and lower yields, higher labor costs, and higher consumer prices as compared to [[conventional farming]] methods.

==Meaning, history and origin of the term==
{{details|topic=the production of organic food|Organic farming}}

For the vast majority of its history, agriculture can be described as having been organic; only during the 20th century was a large supply of new products, generally deemed not organic, introduced into food production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/teaching-the-food-system/curriculum/_pdf/History_of_Food-Background.pdf|title=History of food, p. 3|website=jhsph.edu}}</ref> The organic farming movement arose in the 1940s in response to the [[industrialization]] of [[agriculture]].<ref name=Drinkwater>{{cite book|author=Drinkwater, Laurie E.|chapter=Ecological Knowledge: Foundation for Sustainable Organic Agriculture|editor=Francis, Charles|title=Organic farming: the ecological system|publisher=ASA-CSSA-SSSA|year=2009|isbn=978-0-89118-173-6|page=19|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8HMfbQpNq60C&pg=PA19}}</ref>

In 1939, [[Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne|Lord Northbourne]] coined the term ''organic farming'' in his book ''Look to the Land'' (1940), out of his conception of "the farm as organism," to describe a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming—in contrast to what he called ''chemical farming,'' which relied on "imported fertility" and "cannot be self-sufficient nor an organic whole."<ref>{{cite journal|author=John, Paull|title=The Farm as Organism: The Foundational Idea of Organic Agriculture|journal = Elementals: Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania|volume=80|year=2006|pages=14–18|url=http://orgprints.org/10138/01/10138.pdf}}</ref> Early soil scientists also described the differences in soil composition when [[Manure|animal manures]] were used as "organic", because they contain [[Compounds of carbon|carbon compounds]] where [[Monocalcium phosphate|superphosphates]] and [[Haber process|haber]] process nitrogen do not.

This class of molecules includes everything likely to be considered edible, and include most pesticides and toxins too, therefore the term "organic" and, especially, the term "inorganic" (sometimes wrongly used as a contrast by the popular press) as they apply to organic chemistry is an equivocation fallacy when applied to farming, the production of food, and to foodstuffs themselves. Properly used in this agricultural science context, "organic" refers to the methods grown and processed, not necessarily the chemical composition of the food.

Ideas that organic food could be healthier and better for the environment originated in the early days of the [[organic movement]] as a result of publications like the 1943 book [[The Living Soil]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Balfour|first1=Lady Eve|title=Towards a Sustainable Agriculture--The Living Soil|url=http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010116Balfourspeech.html|publisher=IFOAM|access-date=20 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224214556/http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010116Balfourspeech.html|archive-date=24 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Balfour|url=http://www.ifoam.org/en/lady-eve-balfour|website=IFOAM|access-date=21 August 2014}}</ref> and ''Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease'' (1945).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Sir Albert|title=Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease (The Soil and Health)|url=http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howardSH/SH10.html|website=Journey to forever online library|publisher=Faber and Faber Limited|access-date=18 August 2014}}</ref>

In the industrial era, organic gardening reached a modest level of popularity in the United States in the 1950s. In the 1960s, environmentalists and the counterculture championed organic food, but it was only in the 1970s that a national marketplace for organic foods developed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjEtDwAAQBAJ&q=whole+foods&pg=PT302|title=From Head Shops to Whole Foods: The Rise and Fall of Activist Entrepreneurs|last=Davis|first=Joshua Clark|date=2017-08-08|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231543088|language=en}}</ref>

Early consumers interested in organic food would look for non-chemically treated, non-use of unapproved pesticides, fresh or minimally processed food. They mostly had to buy directly from growers. Later, "Know your farmer, know your food" became the motto of a new initiative instituted by the USDA in September 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philpott|first=Tom|title=Quick thoughts on the USDA's 'Know Your Farmer' program|url=http://grist.org/article/2009-09-16-quick-thoughts-on-the-usdas-know-your-farmer-program|website=Grist * A Beacon in the Smog|publisher=Grist Magazine, Inc.|access-date=2014-01-28|date=2009-09-17}}</ref> Personal definitions of what constituted "organic" were developed through firsthand experience: by talking to farmers, seeing farm conditions, and farming activities.

In the 1970s, interest in organic food grew with the rise of the [[environmental movement]], and was also spurred by food-related health scares like the concerns about [[Daminozide|Alar]] that arose in the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pollan|first1=Michael|title=The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals|url=https://archive.org/details/omnivoresdilemma00poll_0|url-access=registration|date=2006|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=New York}}</ref>

{{See also|List of countries with organic agriculture regulation}}

Organic food production is a self-regulated industry with government oversight in some countries, distinct from [[Kitchen garden|private gardening]]. Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain [[Organic certification|special certification]] based on government-defined standards in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these regulations, foods marketed as organic are produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by national governments and international organic industry trade organizations.

In the United States, organic production is managed in accordance with the [[Organic Foods Production Act of 1990]] (OFPA) and regulations in Title 7, Part 205 of the Code of Federal Regulations to respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.<ref name=USDANOP/> If livestock are involved, the livestock must be reared with regular access to pasture and without the routine use of antibiotics or [[Bovine somatotropin|growth hormones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5082653&acct=noprulemaking|title=Access to Pasture Rule for Organic Livestock|publisher=Ams.usda.gov|access-date=2012-09-09}}</ref>

Processed organic food usually contains only organic ingredients. If non-organic ingredients are present, at least a certain percentage of the food's total plant and animal ingredients must be organic (95% in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3004323&acct=nopgeninfo |title=Labeling: Preamble |access-date=2012-09-09}}</ref> Canada, and Australia).

It also may have the USDA seal. 2)‘Organic’: At least 95% or more of the ingredients are organic. 3)’Made With Organic Ingredients': Contains at least 70% organic ingredients. 4)‘Less Than 70% Organic Ingredients’: Three of the organic ingredients must be listed under the ingredient section of the label.<ref>"USDA organic: what qualifies as organic?"

==Chemical composition==
[[File:Sign at the Sonoma Farmers market - Stierch.jpg|thumb|upright|Organic vegetables at a farmers' market]]
With respect to chemical differences in the composition of organically grown food compared with conventionally grown food, studies have examined differences in [[nutrients]], [[antinutrients]], and [[pesticide]] residues.<ref name=baranski2017/> These studies generally suffer from [[confounding]] variables, and are difficult to generalize due to differences in the tests that were done, the methods of testing, and because the vagaries of agriculture affect the chemical composition of food;<ref name=baranski2017/> these variables include variations in weather (season to season as well as place to place); crop treatments (fertilizer, pesticide, etc.); soil composition; the cultivar used, and in the case of meat and dairy products, the parallel variables in animal production.<ref name=2014meta/><ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/>  Treatment of the foodstuffs after initial gathering (whether milk is pasteurized or raw), the length of time between harvest and analysis, as well as conditions of transport and storage, also affect the chemical composition of a given item of food.<ref name=2014meta/><ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/> Additionally, there is evidence that organic produce is drier than conventionally grown produce; a higher content in any chemical category may be explained by higher concentration rather than in absolute amounts.<ref name=Blair1/>{{page needed|date=May 2015}}

===Nutrients===
Many people believe that organic foods have higher content of nutrients and thus are healthier than conventionally produced foods.<ref name="reuters">{{cite web|title=Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study|publisher=Reuters Health|author=Genevra Pittman|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-organic-idUSBRE88303620120904|date=4 September 2012}}</ref> However, scientists have not been equally convinced that this is the case as the research conducted in the field has not shown consistent results.

A 2009 systematic review found that organically produced foodstuffs are not richer in vitamins and minerals than conventionally produced foodstuffs.<ref name="Smith-Spangler2012" /> The results of the systematic review only showed a lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus content in organic produced compared to conventionally grown foodstuffs. Content of vitamin C, calcium, potassium, total soluble solids, copper, iron, nitrates, manganese, and sodium did not differ between the two categories.<ref name=reuters/>

A 2012 survey of the scientific literature did not find significant differences in the vitamin content of organic and conventional plant or animal products, and found that results varied from study to study.<ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/> Produce studies reported on [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]]) (31 studies), [[beta-carotene]] (a precursor for [[vitamin A]]) (12 studies), and [[alpha-tocopherol]] (a form of [[vitamin E]]) (5 studies) content;  milk studies reported on beta-carotene (4 studies) and alpha-tocopherol levels (4 studies). Few studies examined vitamin content in meats, but these found no difference in beta-carotene in beef, alpha-tocopherol in pork or beef, or vitamin A (retinol) in beef. The authors analyzed 11 other nutrients reported in studies of produce. A 2011 literature review found that organic foods had a higher micronutrient content overall than conventionally produced foods.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=Duncan|last2=Foster|first2=Meika|last3=McArthur|first3=Jennifer O.|last4=Ojha|first4=Rachel|last5=Petocz|first5=Peter|last6=Samman|first6=Samir|title=Evaluation of the Micronutrient Composition of Plant Foods Produced by Organic and Conventional Agricultural Methods|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|date=July 2011|volume=51|issue=6|pages=571–582|doi=10.1080/10408391003721701|pmid=21929333|s2cid=10165731}}</ref>

Similarly, organic chicken contained higher levels of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s{<ref>https://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/18/health/organic-meat-milk-fatty-acids-omega-3s/index.html</ref>} than conventional chicken.

A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that organic meat had comparable or slightly lower levels of [[saturated fat]] and [[monounsaturated fat]] as conventional meat, but higher levels of both overall and n-3 [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Średnicka-Tober|first1=D|last2=Barański|first2=M|last3=Seal|first3=C|last4=Sanderson|first4=R|last5=Benbrook|first5=C|last6=Steinshamn|first6=H|last7=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first7=J|last8=Rembiałkowska|first8=E|last9=Skwarło-Sońta|first9=K|last10=Eyre|first10=M|last11=Cozzi|first11=G|last12=Krogh Larsen|first12=M|last13=Jordon|first13=T|last14=Niggli|first14=U|last15=Sakowski|first15=T|last16=Calder|first16=PC|last17=Burdge|first17=GC|last18=Sotiraki|first18=S|last19=Stefanakis|first19=A|last20=Yolcu|first20=H|last21=Stergiadis|first21=S|last22=Chatzidimitriou|first22=E|last23=Butler|first23=G|last24=Stewart|first24=G|last25=Leifert|first25=C|title=Composition differences between organic and conventional meat: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis|journal=The British Journal of Nutrition|date=March 2016|volume=115|issue=6|pages=994–1011|doi=10.1017/S0007114515005073|pmid=26878675|pmc=4838835}}</ref> Another meta-analysis published the same year found no significant differences in levels of saturated and monounsaturated fat between organic and conventional milk,  but significantly higher levels of overall and n-3 [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s in organic milk than in conventional milk.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Średnicka-Tober|first1=D|last2=Barański|first2=M|last3=Seal|first3=CJ|last4=Sanderson|first4=R|last5=Benbrook|first5=C|last6=Steinshamn|first6=H|last7=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first7=J|last8=Rembiałkowska|first8=E|last9=Skwarło-Sońta|first9=K|last10=Eyre|first10=M|last11=Cozzi|first11=G|last12=Larsen|first12=MK|last13=Jordon|first13=T|last14=Niggli|first14=U|last15=Sakowski|first15=T|last16=Calder|first16=PC|last17=Burdge|first17=GC|last18=Sotiraki|first18=S|last19=Stefanakis|first19=A|last20=Stergiadis|first20=S|last21=Yolcu|first21=H|last22=Chatzidimitriou|first22=E|last23=Butler|first23=G|last24=Stewart|first24=G|last25=Leifert|first25=C|title=Higher PUFA and n-3 PUFA, conjugated linoleic acid, α-tocopherol and iron, but lower iodine and selenium concentrations in organic milk: a systematic literature review and meta- and redundancy analyses|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|date=March 2016|volume=115|issue=6|pages=1043–60|doi=10.1017/S0007114516000349|pmid=26878105|pmc=4838834}}</ref>

===Anti-nutrients===
The amount of [[nitrogen]] content in certain vegetables, especially green [[leafy vegetables]] and [[tuber]]s, has been found to be lower when grown organically as compared to conventionally.<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 />  When evaluating environmental toxins such as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], the USDA has noted that organically raised [[chicken]] may have lower [[arsenic]] levels.<ref name=USDA /> Early literature reviews found no significant evidence that levels of arsenic, [[cadmium]] or other heavy metals differed significantly between organic and conventional food products.<ref name=Blair1/>{{page needed|date=May 2015}}<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /> However, a 2014 review found lower concentrations of cadmium, particularly in organically grown grains.<ref name=2014meta/>

===Phytochemicals===
A 2014 meta-analysis of 343 studies on [[phytochemical]] composition found that organically grown crops had lower [[cadmium]] and pesticide residues, and 17% higher concentrations of [[polyphenols]] than conventionally grown crops.<ref name="2014meta">{{cite journal|last1=Barański|first1=M|last2=Srednicka-Tober|first2=D|last3=Volakakis|first3=N|last4=Seal|first4=C|last5=Sanderson|first5=R|last6=Stewart|first6=GB|last7=Benbrook|first7=C|last8=Biavati|first8=B|last9=Markellou|first9=E|last10=Giotis|first10=C|last11=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first11=J|last12=Rembiałkowska|first12=E|last13=Skwarło-Sońta|first13=K|last14=Tahvonen|first14=R|last15=Janovská|first15=D|last16=Niggli|first16=U|last17=Nicot|first17=P|last18=Leifert|first18=C|title=Higher antioxidant and lower cadmium concentrations and lower incidence of pesticide residues in organically grown crops: a systematic literature review and meta-analyses|journal=The British Journal of Nutrition|year=2014|pages=1–18|pmid=24968103|doi=10.1017/S0007114514001366|volume=112|issue=5|pmc=4141693}}</ref> Concentrations of [[phenolic acids]], [[flavanones]], [[stilbenes]], [[flavones]], [[flavonols]], and [[anthocyanins]] were elevated, with [[flavanones]] being 69% higher.<ref name=2014meta/> Studies on phytochemical composition of organic crops have numerous deficiencies, including absence of standardized measurements and poor reporting on measures of variability, duplicate or selective reporting of data, publication bias, lack of rigor in studies comparing pesticide residue levels in organic and conventional crops, the geographical origin of samples, and inconsistency of farming and post-harvest methods.<ref name=2014meta/><ref name="Smith-Spangler2012" />

===Pesticide residues===
{{main|Pesticide residue}}
The amount of pesticides that remain in or on food is called pesticide residue. In the United States, before a pesticide can be used on a food crop, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] must determine whether that pesticide can be used without posing a risk to human health.<ref>"Pesticides Health and Safety Information." National Pesticides Information Center. National Pesticides Information Center, 1 Apr.2014.Web.9 Nov.2015.</ref>

A 2012 meta-analysis determined that detectable pesticide residues were found in 7% of organic produce samples and 38% of conventional produce samples. This result was statistically heterogeneous, potentially because of the variable level of detection used among these studies.  Only three studies reported the prevalence of contamination exceeding maximum allowed limits; all were from the European Union.<ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/> A 2014 meta-analysis found that conventionally grown produce was four times more likely to have pesticide residue than organically grown crops.<ref name=2014meta/>

The [[American Cancer Society]] has stated that no evidence exists that the small amount of pesticide residue found on conventional foods will increase the risk of cancer, although it recommends thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables. They have also stated that there is no research to show that organic food reduces cancer risk compared to foods grown with conventional farming methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive/acsguidelinesonnutritionphysicalactivityforcancerprevention/acs-guidelines-on-nutrition-and-physical-activity-for-cancer-prevention-diet-cancer-questions |title=Common questions about diet and cancer |publisher=Cancer.org |access-date=2014-06-17}}</ref>

The Environmental Protection Agency maintains strict guidelines on the regulation of pesticides by setting a tolerance on the amount of pesticide residue allowed to be in or on any particular food.<ref>2013 November, "The ruling on organic foods: are they worth the extra price?" "Healthy Years" ISSN 1551-4617, 11/2013, Volume 10, Issue 11, p. 1</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/viewtols.htm|title=Pesticides and Food: What the Pesticide Residue Limits are on Food|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|date=20 October 2014|access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref>
Although some residue may remain at the time of harvest, residue tend to decline as the pesticide breaks down over time. In addition, as the commodities are washed and processed prior to sale, the residues often diminish further.

===Bacterial contamination===
A 2012 [[meta-analysis]] determined that prevalence of ''[[E. coli]]'' contamination was not [[statistically significant]] (7% in organic produce and 6% in conventional produce). While bacterial contamination is common among both organic and conventional animal products, differences in the prevalence of bacterial contamination between organic and conventional animal products were also statistically insignificant.<ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/>

==Organic meat production requirements==

===United States===
Organic meat certification in the United States requires farm animals to be raised according to USDA organic regulations throughout their lives. These regulations require that livestock are fed certified organic food that contains no animal byproducts.<ref name="usda">{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5102526 |title=Organic Livestock Requirements |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |date=July 2013 |access-date=2014-06-17}}</ref> Further, organic farm animals can receive no [[growth hormones]] or [[antibiotics]], and they must be raised using techniques that protect native species and other natural resources.

==Health and safety==

There is little scientific evidence of benefit or harm to human health from a diet high in organic food, and conducting any sort of rigorous experiment on the subject is very difficult. A 2012 meta-analysis noted that "there have been no long-term studies of health outcomes of populations consuming predominantly organic versus conventionally produced food controlling for socioeconomic factors; such studies would be expensive to conduct."<ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/>  A 2009 meta-analysis noted that "most of the included articles did not study direct human health outcomes. In ten of the included studies (83%), a primary outcome was the change in antioxidant activity. Antioxidant status and activity are useful biomarkers but do not directly equate to a health outcome. Of the remaining two articles, one recorded proxy-reported measures of atopic manifestations as its primary health outcome, whereas the other article examined the fatty acid composition of breast milk and implied possible health benefits for infants from the consumption of different amounts of conjugated linoleic acids from breast milk."<ref name=Dangour2009 />  In addition, as discussed above, difficulties in accurately and meaningfully measuring chemical differences between organic and conventional food make it difficult to extrapolate health recommendations based solely on chemical analysis.

As of 2012, the scientific consensus is that while "consumers may choose to buy organic fruit, vegetables and meat because they believe them to be more nutritious than other food.... the balance of current scientific evidence does not support this view."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Food Standards Agency's Current Stance|url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/organicfood2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331234955/http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/organicfood2.pdf|archive-date=March 31, 2010}}</ref> The evidence of beneficial health effects of organic food consumption is scarce, which has led researchers to call for more long-term studies.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hurtado-Barroso |first1=Sara |last2=Tresserra-Rimbau |first2=Anna |last3=Vallverdú-Queralt |first3=Anna |last4=Lamuela-Raventós |first4=Rosa María |date=2017-11-30 |title=Organic food and the impact on human health |journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=704–714 |doi=10.1080/10408398.2017.1394815 |issn=1549-7852 |pmid=29190113|s2cid=39034672 }}</ref> In addition, studies that suggest that organic foods may be healthier than conventional foods face significant methodological challenges, such as the correlation between organic food consumption and factors known to promote a healthy lifestyle.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Brantsæter |first1=Anne Lise |last2=Ydersbond |first2=Trond A. |last3=Hoppin |first3=Jane A. |last4=Haugen |first4=Margaretha |last5=Meltzer |first5=Helle Margrete |date=2017-03-20 |title=Organic Food in the Diet: Exposure and Health Implications|journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=38 |pages=295–313 |doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031816-044437 |issn=1545-2093 |pmid=27992727|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mie |first1=Axel |last2=Andersen |first2=Helle Raun |last3=Gunnarsson |first3=Stefan |last4=Kahl |first4=Johannes |last5=Kesse-Guyot |first5=Emmanuelle |last6=Rembiałkowska |first6=Ewa |last7=Quaglio |first7=Gianluca |last8=Grandjean |first8=Philippe |date=2017-10-27 |title=Human health implications of organic food and organic agriculture: a comprehensive review |journal=Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=111 |doi=10.1186/s12940-017-0315-4 |issn=1476-069X |pmc=5658984 |pmid=29073935}}</ref> When the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] reviewed the literature on organic foods in 2012, they found that "current evidence does not support any meaningful nutritional benefits or deficits from eating organic compared with conventionally grown foods, and there are no well-powered human studies that directly demonstrate health benefits or disease protection as a result of consuming an organic diet."<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Forman |first1=Joel |last2=Silverstein |first2=Janet |last3=Committee on Nutrition |last4=Council on Environmental Health |last5=American Academy of Pediatrics |date=November 2012 |title=Organic foods: health and environmental advantages and disadvantages |journal=Pediatrics |volume=130 |issue=5 |pages=e1406–1415 |doi=10.1542/peds.2012-2579 |issn=1098-4275 |pmid=23090335|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Consumer safety===

====Pesticide exposure====
The main difference between organic and conventional food products are the chemicals involved during production and processing. The residues of those chemicals in food products have dubious effects on human health. All food products on the market including those that contain residues of pesticides, antibiotics, growth hormones and other types of chemicals that are used during production and processing are said to be safe.<ref>"Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study. Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study, 4 Sept.2012.Web.9 Nov.2015</ref>

Claims of improved safety of organic food has largely focused on [[pesticide residue]]s.<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 />  These concerns are driven by the facts that "(1) acute, massive exposure to pesticides can cause significant adverse health effects;
(2) food products have occasionally been contaminated with pesticides, which can result in acute toxicity; and (3) most, if not all, commercially purchased food contains trace amounts of agricultural pesticides."<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 />  However, as is frequently noted in the scientific literature: "What does not follow from this, however, is that chronic exposure to the trace amounts of pesticides found in food results in demonstrable toxicity. This possibility is practically impossible to study and quantify;" therefore firm conclusions about the relative safety of organic foods have been hampered by the difficulty in proper [[study design]] and relatively small number of studies directly comparing organic food to conventional food.<ref name=Blair1/><ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /><ref name=Bourn /><ref name=Canavari2009/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Joseph D.|title=A Review of the Nutrition Claims Made by Proponents of Organic Food|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|date=May 2010|volume=9|issue=3|pages=270–277|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00108.x }}</ref>

Additionally, the Carcinogenic Potency Project,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cpdb.thomas-slone.org/|title=The Carcinogenic Potency Project (CPDB)}}</ref> which is a part of the US [[EPA]]'s Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) Database Network,<ref>National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) [http://www.epa.gov/ncct/dsstox/ DSSTox Official Website]</ref> has been systemically testing the [[carcinogen]]icity of chemicals, both natural and synthetic, and building a publicly available database of the results<ref>[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/html/cpdbfs.htm Publicly available Toxnet database from US NLM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218135909/http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/html/cpdbfs.htm |date=2013-02-18 }}</ref> for the past ~30 years.  Their work attempts to fill in the gaps in our scientific knowledge of the carcinogenicity of all chemicals, both natural and synthetic, as the scientists conducting the Project described in the journal, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', in 1992: <blockquote>Toxicological examination of synthetic chemicals, without similar examination of chemicals that occur naturally, has resulted in an imbalance in both the data on and the perception of chemical carcinogens. Three points that we have discussed indicate that comparisons should be made with natural as well as synthetic chemicals.<br />
1) The vast proportion of chemicals that humans are exposed to occur naturally. Nevertheless, the public tends to view chemicals as only synthetic and to think of synthetic chemicals as toxic despite the fact that every natural chemical is also toxic at some dose. The daily average exposure of Americans to burnt material in the diet is ~2000 mg, and exposure to natural pesticides (the chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves) is ~1500 mg. In comparison, the total daily exposure to all synthetic pesticide residues combined is ~0.09 mg. Thus, we estimate that 99.99% of the pesticides humans ingest are natural. Despite this enormously greater exposure to natural chemicals, 79% (378 out of 479) of the chemicals tested for carcinogenicity in both rats and mice are synthetic (that is, do not occur naturally). <br />
2) It has often been wrongly assumed that humans have evolved defenses against the natural chemicals in our diet but not against the synthetic chemicals. However, defenses that animals have evolved are mostly general rather than specific for particular chemicals; moreover, defenses are generally inducible and therefore protect well from low doses of both synthetic and natural chemicals.<br />
3) Because the toxicology of natural and synthetic chemicals is similar, one expects (and finds) a similar positivity rate for carcinogenicity among synthetic and natural chemicals. The positivity rate among chemicals tested in rats and mice is ~50%. Therefore, because humans are exposed to so many more natural than synthetic chemicals (by weight and by number), humans are exposed to an enormous background of rodent carcinogens, as defined by high-dose tests on rodents. We have shown that even though only a tiny proportion of natural pesticides in plant foods have been tested, the 29 that are rodent carcinogens among the 57 tested, occur in more than 50 common plant foods. It is probable that almost every fruit and vegetable in the supermarket contains natural pesticides that are rodent carcinogens.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gold L.S.| year = 1992 | title = Rodent carcinogens: Setting priorities | url = http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cpdb/pdfs/Science1992.pdf | journal = Science | volume = 258 | issue = 5080| pages = 261–265 | doi=10.1126/science.1411524| pmid = 1411524 |display-authors=etal| bibcode = 1992Sci...258..261S }}</ref></blockquote>
