He was part of a group of students that helped out during the Annual Meetings of the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], Switzerland. There, he met leading international government officials and bankers,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and in 1994 he began his professional career at WEF.

He worked at [[Moore Capital Management]], a hedge fund in New York and London, where he met his wife.<ref name="Times0109"/> He then worked as head of hedge funds for Geneva-based [[Union Bancaire Privée]] before he joined the SNB.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Hildebrand was said to be the "youngest ever policy maker" when he joined the SNB in 2003.<ref name=Bl01>Goodman, David and Klaus Wille, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-05/swiss-franc-declines-to-three-week-low-versus-dollar-hildebrand-will-stay.html "Swiss Franc Declines to Three-Week Low Versus Dollar; Hildebrand Will Stay"], ''Bloomberg.com'', January 5, 2012 11:15 am ET.

Prior to his resignation from the SNB, he was a member of the board of directors of the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]], as well as vice-chairman of the [[Financial Stability Board]]. Since 2008, he has been a member of the [[Group of Thirty]].

In late 2011, ''The Banker'' magazine named Hildebrand "Central Bank Governor of the Year 2012".<ref>[http://www.thebanker.com/Awards/Central-Bank-Governor-of-the-Year "Central Bank Governor of the Year 2012 - Global and Americas" (free registration required)], 19/12/2011.

=== Controversy around the 2009/2010 exchange rate interventions ===
Hildebrand was attacked after losses arising from SNB’s exchange rate interventions between March 2009 and June 2010. In this period, the SNB accumulated foreign currency reserves worth over 200 billion Swiss francs (Codes: [[Swiss franc|CHF]], SFr). As the Swiss franc has appreciated, the interventions caused losses on SNB foreign currency positions equivalent to 26.5 billion Swiss francs in 2010 and 11.7 billion Swiss francs in the first six months of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2010|url=http://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/reference/annrep_2010_komplett/source|publisher=SNB|accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>  The SNB has defended these interventions as they made “sense at the zero lower bound when the traditional monetary policy instrument is exhausted”.<ref>{{cite web|last=[[Jean-Pierre Danthine|Danthine]]|first=Jean Pierre|title=Swiss monetary policy in the public eye|url=http://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/speeches/id/ref_20110324_jpd/source/ref_20110324_jpd.en.pdf|work=Speech at the Money Market Event Zurich, 24 March 2011|publisher=SNB|accessdate= 2 September 2011}}</ref> Some international press and financial market analysts considered the interventions a “costly failure”.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Financial Times|title=Resurgent Swiss franc seems unstoppable|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/85d42594-baaf-11df-b73d-00144feab49a.html#axzz1WpVBmioY|accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref>

The People’s Party ([[Schweizerische Volkspartei]] (SVP) / Union Démocratique du Centre (UDC)) and the magazine ''Weltwoche'' are critics of Hildebrand, demanding his resignation. Prominent figures of other parties supported Hildebrand and emphasized the political independence of the SNB. In an article titled “With Unsteady Hand”, Switzerland’s major business magazine ''Bilanz'' criticized Mr. Hildebrand’s leadership of SNB, citing his limited experience and saying that Mr. Hildebrand’s actions in large parts seem to be the result of his eagerness to appeal to the public.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=BILANZ (#15, 2011)|title=Nationalbank: Mit unruhiger Hand|url=http://www.bilanz.ch/magazin|accessdate=2011-08-26}}</ref>

=== Pegging of the Swiss Franc to the Euro since 6 September 2011 ===
