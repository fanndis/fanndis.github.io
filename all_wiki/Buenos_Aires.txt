"Buenos Aires" can be translated as "fair winds" or "good airs", but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name "Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre", named after the Madonna of Bonaria in [[Sardinia, Italy|Sardinia]]. The [[Greater Buenos Aires]] conurbation, which also includes several [[Buenos Aires Province]] [[Partidos of Buenos Aires|districts]], constitutes the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Americas|fifth-most populous]] metropolitan area in the [[Americas]], with a population of around 15.6&nbsp;million.<ref name="indecpop">{{cite web |url = http://www.censo2010.indec.gov.ar/preliminares/cuadro_totalpais.asp |title = Censo 2010.

The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of [[Buenos Aires Province]] nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an [[autonomous city|autonomous]] district. In 1880, after [[Argentine Civil War|decades of political infighting]], Buenos Aires was [[federalization of Buenos Aires|federalized]] and removed from Buenos Aires Province.<ref>{{Cite book |title=La federalización de Buenos Aires: debates y documentos |last=Ruiz Moreno |first=Isidro |publisher=Buenos Aires: Hyspamerica |year=1986 |isbn=978-950-614-467-8 |location=Buenos Aires }}</ref> The [[city limits]] were enlarged to include the towns of [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] and [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]]; both are now [[barrios and Communes of Buenos Aires|neighborhoods of the city]]. The [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|1994 constitutional amendment]] granted the city [[autonomous area|autonomy]], hence its formal name of Autonomous City of Buenos Aires ({{lang|es|Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires}}; "CABA"). Its citizens first elected a [[list of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|chief of government]] (i.e. mayor) in 1996; previously, the mayor was directly appointed by the [[President of Argentina|President of the Republic]].

Buenos Aires is a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] city, being home to multiple ethnic and religious groups. Several languages are spoken in the city in addition to Spanish, contributing to its culture and the dialect spoken in the city and in some other parts of the country. This is because since the 19th century the city, and the country in general, has been a major recipient of millions of [[Immigration to Argentina|immigrants from all over the world]], making it a [[melting pot]] where several ethnic groups live together and being considered one of the most diverse cities of [[the Americas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/cultos/turismo-religioso |author=Buenos Aires Ciudad |title=Turismo Religioso |language=es |access-date=25 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105115134/http://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/cultos/turismo-religioso |archive-date=5 January 2016  }}</ref>

It is recorded under the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese's]] archives that Catalan missionaries and Jesuits arriving in [[Cagliari]] ([[Sardinia]]) under the Crown of Aragon, after its capture from the [[Pisa]]ns in 1324 established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city.<ref name="catalanname" /> The hill was known to them as ''Bonaira'' (or ''Bonaria'' in [[Sardinian language]]), as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city (the castle area), which is adjacent to [[swampland]]. During the Cagliari's siege, the Catalans built a [[Shrine of Our Lady of Bonaria|sanctuary]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] on top of the hill. In 1335, King [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|Alfonso the Gentle]] donated the church to the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarians]], who built an [[abbey]] that stands to this day. In the years after that, a story circulated, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously helped to calm a storm in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The statue was placed in the abbey. Spanish sailors, especially [[Andalusia]]ns, venerated this image and frequently invoked the "Fair Winds" to aid them in their [[navigation]] and prevent [[shipwreck]]s. A sanctuary to the Virgin of Buen Ayre would be later erected in [[Seville]].<ref name="catalanname">{{cite web | url=http://en.todobuenosaires.com/buenos_aires/en/historia/origenombre.php | title=Origin of the name Buenos Aires | publisher=Todo Buenos Aires | accessdate=18 January 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119003340/http://en.todobuenosaires.com/buenos_aires/en/historia/origenombre.php | archive-date=19 January 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In the first foundation of Buenos Aires, Spanish sailors arrived thankfully in the [[Río de la Plata]] by the blessings of the "Santa Maria de los Buenos Aires", the "Holy Virgin Mary of the Good Winds" who was said to have given them the good winds to reach the coast of what is today the modern city of Buenos Aires.<ref name="banderin"/> [[Pedro de Mendoza]] called the city "Holy Mary of the Fair Winds", a name suggested by the chaplain of Mendoza's expedition – a devotee of the Virgin of Buen Ayre – after the ''Madonna'' of Bonaria from [[Sardinia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pittau.it/Sardo/bonaria.html|title=Massimo Pittau – La Madonna di Bonaria di Cagliari e Buenos Aires|work=pittau.it|access-date=13 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208055821/http://www.pittau.it/Sardo/bonaria.html|archive-date=8 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> (which is still to this day the patroness of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] island<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avvenire.it/Chiesa/Pagine/papa-francesco-a-cagliari-legame-bonaria-buenos-aires.aspx|title=Quel legame mariano tra Bonaria e Buenos Aires|work=avvenire.it|access-date=13 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208055821/http://www.avvenire.it/Chiesa/Pagine/papa-francesco-a-cagliari-legame-bonaria-buenos-aires.aspx|archive-date=8 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>). Mendoza's settlement soon came under attack by indigenous people, and was abandoned in 1541.<ref name="banderin">{{cite web | language=es | url=http://rotaryba.com.ar/?page_id=80 | title=Nuestro Banderín | publisher=Buenos Aires Rotary Club | accessdate=18 January 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119004113/http://rotaryba.com.ar/?page_id=80 | archive-date=19 January 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>

For many years, the name was attributed to a Sancho del Campo, who is said to have exclaimed: ''How fair are the winds of this land!'', as he arrived. But [[Eduardo Madero]], in 1882 after conducting extensive research in Spanish archives, ultimately concluded that the name was indeed closely linked with the devotion of the sailors to Our Lady of Buen Ayre.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/estudiotopogrfi00martgoog | quote=sancho del campo buenos aires. | title=Estudio topográfico é historia demografica de la ciudad de Buenos Aires | publisher=Compañía Sud-Americana de Billetes de Banco | author=B.

A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], who sailed down the [[Paraná River]] from [[Asunción]] (now the capital of Paraguay). Garay preserved the name originally chosen by Mendoza, calling the city ''Ciudad de la Santísima Trinidad y Puerto de Santa María del Buen Aire'' ("City of the Most Holy Trinity and Port of Saint Mary of the Fair Winds"). The short form "Buenos Aires" became common usage during the 17th century.<ref name="provincia">{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/ciudad/historico/calendario/destacado.php?menu_id=23203&ide=44 |title=Calendario Histórico – Segunda fundación de Buenos Aires |language=es |publisher=Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires |accessdate=9 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024201506/http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/ciudad/historico/calendario/destacado.php?menu_id=23203&ide=44 |archive-date=24 October 2012 }}</ref>

Seaman [[Juan Díaz de Solís]], navigating in the name of Spain, was the first European to reach the [[Río de la Plata]] in 1516. His expedition was cut short when he was killed during an attack by the native [[Charrua|Charrúa]] tribe in what is now [[Uruguay]].

The city of Buenos Aires was first established as ''Ciudad de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre''<ref name="Short history"/> (literally "City of Our Lady Saint Mary of the Fair Winds") after [[Shrine of Our Lady of Bonaria|Our Lady of Bonaria]] (Patroness Saint of [[Sardinia]]) on 2 February 1536 by a Spanish expedition led by [[Pedro de Mendoza]]. The settlement founded by Mendoza was located in what is today the [[San Telmo]] district of Buenos Aires, south of the city centre.

More attacks by the indigenous people forced the settlers away, and in 1542 the site was abandoned.<ref>[http://www.laeducacion.com/vinculos/materias/historia/not020107.htm Aborígenes de la Argentina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605092500/http://www.laeducacion.com/vinculos/materias/historia/not020107.htm |date=5 June 2014 }}.

He dubbed the settlement "Santísima Trinidad" and its port became "Puerto de Santa María de los Buenos Aires."<ref name="provincia"/>

From its earliest days, Buenos Aires depended primarily on trade. During most of the 17th century, Spanish ships were menaced by pirates, so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection were dispatched to Central America in a convoy from Seville (the only port allowed to trade with the colonies) to [[Lima|Lima, Peru]], and from it to the inner cities of the viceroyalty. Because of this, products took a very long time to arrive in Buenos Aires, and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive. This scheme frustrated the traders of Buenos Aires, and a thriving informal yet accepted by the authorities contraband industry developed inside the colonies and with the Portuguese. This also instilled a deep resentment among ''[[porteño]]s'' towards the Spanish authorities.<ref name="Short history"/>

Sensing these feelings, [[Charles III of Spain]] progressively eased the trade restrictions and finally declared Buenos Aires an open port in the late 18th century. The capture of [[Portobelo, Colón|Porto Bello]] by British forces also fueled the need to foster commerce via the Atlantic route, to the detriment of Lima-based trade. One of his rulings was to split a region from the Viceroyalty of Perú and create instead the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], with Buenos Aires as the capital. However, Charles's placating actions did not have the desired effect, and the ''porteños'', some of them versed in the ideology of the [[French Revolution]], became even more convinced of the need for independence from Spain.

In this area now lies the [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]].]]

During the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]], British forces attacked Buenos Aires twice. In 1806 the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires, but an army from [[Montevideo]] led by [[Santiago de Liniers]] defeated them. In the brief period of British rule, the viceroy [[Rafael Sobremonte]] managed to escape to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and designated this city as capital. Buenos Aires became the capital again after its liberation, but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy. Santiago de Liniers, chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack and repelled the attempted invasion of 1807. The militarization generated in society changed the balance of power favorably for the [[criollo people|criollo]]s (in contrast to [[peninsulars]]), as well as the development of the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain. An attempt by the peninsular merchant [[Martín de Álzaga]] to remove Liniers and replace him with a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Junta]] was defeated by the criollo armies. However, by 1810 it would be those same armies who would support a new revolutionary attempt, successfully removing the new viceroy [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]]. This is known as the [[May Revolution]], which is now celebrated as a national holiday. This event started the [[Argentine War of Independence]], and many armies left Buenos Aires to fight the diverse strongholds of royalist resistance, with varying levels of success. The government was held first by two Juntas of many members, then by two [[triumvirate]]s, and finally by a unipersonal office, the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Supreme Director]]. Formal independence from Spain was [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared]] in 1816, at the [[Congress of Tucumán]]. Buenos Aires managed to endure the whole [[Spanish American wars of independence]] without falling again under royalist rule.

Historically, Buenos Aires has been Argentina's main venue of [[liberalism|liberal]], [[free trade|free-trading]] and foreign ideas, while many of the provinces, especially those to the north-west, advocated a more [[nationalism|nationalistic]] and [[Catholic]] approach to political and social issues. Much of the internal tension in Argentina's history, starting with the centralist-federalist conflicts of the 19th century, can be traced back to these contrasting views. In the months immediately following the 25 May Revolution, Buenos Aires sent a number of military envoys to the provinces with the intention of obtaining their approval. Many of these missions ended in violent clashes, and the enterprise fuelled tensions between the capital and the provinces.

In the 19th century the city was [[blockade]]d twice by naval forces: by the [[French blockade of the Río de la Plata|French]] from 1838 to 1840, and later by an [[Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata|Anglo-French]] expedition from 1845 to 1848. Both blockades failed to force the city into submission, and the foreign powers eventually desisted from their demands.

===19th and 20th century===

During most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject. It was already the capital of [[Buenos Aires Province]], and between 1853 and 1860 it was the capital of the seceded [[State of Buenos Aires]]. The issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in 1880 when the city was [[Federalization of Buenos Aires|federalized]] and became the seat of government, with its mayor appointed by the president. The [[Casa Rosada]] became the seat of the [[President of Argentina|president]].<ref name="provincia"/>

Health conditions in poor areas were negative, with high rates of tuberculosis. Public-health physicians and politicians typically blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses (conventillos) for the spread of the dreaded disease. People ignored public-health campaigns to limit the spread of contagious diseases, such as the prohibition of spitting on the streets, the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children, and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones.<ref>Diego Armus, ''The Ailing City: Health, Tuberculosis, and Culture in Buenos Aires, 1870–1950'' (2011)</ref> [[File:Museo del Bicentenario - "La Casa Rosada" por Della Valle.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Casa Rosada]] during the [[Argentina Centennial]], 1910.]]

In addition to the wealth generated by the [[Buenos Aires Customs]] and the fertile [[pampas]], [[Rail transport in Argentina|railroad development]] in the second half of the 19th century increased the economic power of Buenos Aires as raw materials flowed into its factories. A leading destination for immigrants from Europe, particularly Italy and Spain, from 1880 to 1930 Buenos Aires became a multicultural city that ranked itself with the major European capitals. The [[Teatro Colón|Colón Theater]] became one of the world's top opera venues, and the city became the regional capital of [[Radio in Argentina|radio]], [[Television in Argentina|television]], [[Argentine cinema|cinema]], and [[Culture of Argentina#Theater|theatre]]. The city's main avenues were built during those years, and the dawn of the 20th century saw the construction of South America's tallest buildings and its first [[Buenos Aires Underground|underground]] system. A second construction boom, from 1945 to 1980, reshaped downtown and much of the city. [[File:Buenos Aires - San Nicolás - Construcción del Obelisco.jpg|thumb|Construction of the [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires]] on the [[9 de Julio Avenue]], 1936.]] [[File:Buenos Aires, 1986.jpg|thumb|[[9 de Julio Avenue]], 1986.]]

Buenos Aires also attracted migrants from Argentina's provinces and neighboring countries. [[Shanty town]]s (''[[villa miseria|villas miseria]]'') started growing around the city's industrial areas during the 1930s, leading to pervasive social problems and social contrasts with the largely upwardly-mobile Buenos Aires population. These laborers became the political base of [[Peronism]], which emerged in Buenos Aires during the [[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|pivotal demonstration]] of 17 October 1945, at the [[Plaza de Mayo]].<ref name="Clarín guide">''Guía visual de Buenos Aires centro histórico'', [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|''Clarín'']] Viajes, 2001.</ref> Industrial workers of the Greater Buenos Aires industrial belt have been Peronism's main support base ever since, and Plaza de Mayo became the site for demonstrations and many of the country's political events; on 16 June 1955, however, a splinter faction of the Navy bombed the Plaza de Mayo area, killing 364 civilians (see ''[[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]]''). This was the only time the city was attacked from the air, and the event was followed by a military uprising which deposed President Perón, three months later (see ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'').

In the 1970s the city suffered from the fighting between left-wing revolutionary movements ([[Montoneros]], [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]] and F.A.R.) and the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] paramilitary group [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Triple A]], supported by [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]], who became president of Argentina in 1974 after Juan Perón's death.

The [[March 1976 coup]], led by General [[Jorge Videla]], only escalated this conflict; the "[[Dirty War]]" resulted in 30,000 ''[[Forced disappearance|desaparecidos]]'' (people kidnapped and killed by the military during the years of the junta).<ref name="Millions">''We are Millions: Neo-liberalism and new forms of political action in Argentina'', Marcela Lópéz Levy, Latin America Bureau, London, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1899365630}}</ref> The silent marches of their mothers ([[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]]) are a well-known image of Argentines' suffering during those times. The [[National Reorganization Process|dictatorship]]'s appointed mayor, [[Osvaldo Cacciatore]], also drew up plans for a network of freeways intended to relieve the city's acute traffic gridlock. The plan, however, called for a seemingly indiscriminate razing of residential areas and, though only three of the eight planned were put up at the time, they were mostly obtrusive raised freeways that continue to blight a number of formerly comfortable neighborhoods to this day.

The city was visited by [[Pope John Paul II]] twice, firstly in 1982 and again in 1987; on these occasions gathered some of the largest crowds in the city's history. The return of democracy in 1983 coincided with a cultural revival, and the 1990s saw an economic revival, particularly in the construction and financial sectors.

On 17 March 1992 a bomb [[1992 Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires|exploded in the Israeli Embassy]], killing 29 and injuring 242. Another explosion, on 18 July 1994, [[1994 AMIA bombing|destroyed a building]] housing several [[Jew]]ish organizations, killing 85 and injuring many more, these incidents marked the beginning of [[Middle East]]ern [[terrorism]] to South America. Following a [[Pact of Olivos|1993 agreement]], the [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine Constitution]] was amended to give Buenos Aires [[autonomy]] and rescinding, among other things, the president's right to appoint the city's mayor (as had been the case since 1880). On 30 June 1996, voters in Buenos Aires chose their first elected mayor (''[[List of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|Jefe de Gobierno]]'').

===21st century===

In 1996, following the [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution]], the city held its first mayoral elections under the new statutes, with the mayor's title formally changed to "Head of Government". The winner was [[Fernando de la Rúa]], who would later become President of Argentina from 1999 to 2001.

De la Rúa's successor, [[Aníbal Ibarra]], won two popular elections, but was [[impeachment|impeached]] (and ultimately deposed on 6 March 2006) as a result of the fire at the [[República Cromañón nightclub fire|República Cromagnon]] nightclub. [[Jorge Telerman]], who had been the acting mayor, was invested with the office. In the 2007 elections, [[Mauricio Macri]] of the [[Republican Proposal]] (PRO) party won the [[Ballotage in Argentina|second-round]] of voting over [[Daniel Filmus]] of the [[Frente para la Victoria]] (FPV) party, taking office on 9 December 2007. In 2011, the elections went to a second round with 60.96% of the vote for PRO, compared to 39.04% for FPV, thus re-electing Macri as mayor of the city with [[María Eugenia Vidal]] as deputy mayor.<ref>[http://especiales.perfil.com/elecciones-capital-2011/resultadosjefe.php Elecciones 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081711/http://especiales.perfil.com/elecciones-capital-2011/resultadosjefe.php |date=4 March 2016 }} – Perfil</ref>

The 2015 elections were the first to use an [[electronic voting]] system in the city, similar to the one used in [[Salta Province]].<ref>[http://www.informatesalta.com.ar/noticia.asp?q=79437 Más de 300 mil porteños probaron ayer el voto electrónico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622152210/http://informatesalta.com.ar/noticia.asp?q=79437 |date=22 June 2017 }} – InformateSalta, 27 April 2015</ref> In these elections held on 5 July 2015, Macri stepped down as mayor and pursue his [[Argentine general election, 2015|presidential bid]] and [[Horacio Rodríguez Larreta]] took his place as the mayoral candidate for PRO. In the first round of voting, FPV's [[Mariano Recalde]] obtained 21.78% of the vote, while [[Martín Lousteau]] of the ECO party obtained 25.59% and Larreta obtained 45.55%, meaning that the elections went to a second round since PRO was unable to secure the majority required for victory.<ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1807919-elecciones-portenas-2015-amplio-triunfo-de-horacio-rodriguez-larreta-pero-habria-ballottage-con-martin-lousteau Elecciones porteñas 2015: amplio triunfo de Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, pero habrá ballottage con Martín Lousteau] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730150032/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1807919-elecciones-portenas-2015-amplio-triunfo-de-horacio-rodriguez-larreta-pero-habria-ballottage-con-martin-lousteau |date=30 July 2015 }} – La Nacion, 5 July 2015</ref> The second round was held on 19 July 2015 and Larreta obtained 51.6% of the vote, followed closely by Lousteau with 48.4%, thus, PRO won the elections for a third term with Larreta as mayor and [[Diego Santilli]] as deputy.

==Geography==
The city of Buenos Aires lies in the [[pampa|pampa region]], except for some zones like the [[Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve]], the [[Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors (football) Club]] "sports city", [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery|Jorge Newbery Airport]], the [[Puerto Madero]] neighborhood and the main port itself; these were all built on reclaimed land along the coasts of the [[Río de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]] (the world's widest river).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.borello.com.ar/Notas%20de%20Interes/Notas_Riodelaplata.htm |title=Cuenca del Plata |publisher=Borello.com.ar |accessdate=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726235500/http://www.borello.com.ar/Notas%20de%20Interes/Notas_Riodelaplata.htm |archive-date=26 July 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argentinaxplora.com/activida/geogra/geogra.htm |title=Geografia de Argentina |publisher=Argentinaxplora.com |accessdate=13 September 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68cprK5L7?url=http://www.argentinaxplora.com/activida/geogra/geogra.htm |archive-date=23 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bue.gov.ar/especiales/?id=2 |title=Sitio oficial de turismo de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires &#124; LA CIUDAD DE TODOS LOS ARGENTINOS |language=es |publisher=Bue.gov.ar |accessdate=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221144630/http://bue.gov.ar/especiales/?id=2 |archive-date=21 February 2009 }}</ref>

The region was formerly crossed by different [[creek (stream)|streams]] and lagoons, some of which were refilled and others tubed. Among the most important streams are Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, Cildañez and White. In 1908 many streams were channelled and rectified, as floods were damaging the city's infrastructure. Starting in 1919, most streams were enclosed. Notably, the Maldonado was tubed in 1954, and runs below [[Juan B. Justo Avenue]].

==Government and politics==

===Government structure===

[[File:Argentine National Congress.JPG|thumb|right|The Palace of the [[National Congress of Argentina]].]]

The Executive is held by the [[List of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|Chief of Government]] ({{lang-es|link=no|Jefe de Gobierno}}), elected for a four-year term together with a Deputy Chief of Government, who presides over the 60-member [[Buenos Aires City Legislature]]. Each member of the [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|Legislature]] is elected for a four-year term; half of the legislature is renewed every two years. Elections use the [[D'Hondt method]] of proportional representation. The Judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court of Justice (Tribunal Superior de Justicia), the Magistrate's Council (Consejo de la Magistratura), the Public Ministry, and other City Courts. Article 61 of the 1996 Constitution of the City of Buenos Aires states that "''Suffrage is free, equal, secret, universal, compulsory and non-accumulative. Resident aliens enjoy this same right, with its corresponding obligations, on equal terms with Argentine citizens registered in the district, under the terms established by law''."<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=13 December 2007}}</ref>

Legally, the city has less autonomy than the [[Provinces of Argentina|Provinces]]. In June 1996, shortly before the City's first Executive elections were held, the [[Argentine National Congress]] issued the National Law 24.588 (known as [[Antonio Cafiero|Ley Cafiero]], after the [[Argentine Senate|Senator]] who advanced the projemacct) by which the authority over the 25,000-strong [[Argentine Federal Police]] and the responsibility over the federal institutions residing at the City (e.g., [[Supreme Court of Argentina|National Supreme Court of Justice buildings]]) would not be transferred from the [[Government of Argentina|National Government]] to the Autonomous City Government until a new consensus could be reached at the National Congress. Furthermore, it declared that the [[Port of Buenos Aires]], along with some other places, would remain under constituted federal authorities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infobae.com/contenidos/324047-100799-0-Qu%C3%A9-dice-la-Ley-Cafiero |title=''Infobae'': Qué dice la Ley Cafiero |language=es |publisher=Infobae.com |date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328173455/http://www.infobae.com/contenidos/324047-100799-0-Qu%C3%A9-dice-la-Ley-Cafiero |archive-date=28 March 2012  }}</ref> {{As of|2011}}, the deployment of the [[Metropolitan Police (Buenos Aires)|Metropolitan Police of Buenos Aires]] is ongoing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metropolitana.gob.ar/nosotros.html |title=Policía Metropolitana  |publisher=Metropolitana.gob.ar |accessdate=15 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903013239/http://www.metropolitana.gob.ar/nosotros.html |archive-date=3 September 2011 }}</ref>

Beginning in 2007, the city has embarked on a new decentralization scheme, creating new [[Barrios and Communes of Buenos Aires|Communes]] (''comunas'') which are to be managed by elected committees of seven members each. Buenos Aires is represented in the [[Argentine Senate]] by three senators ({{As of|2017|lc=y}}, [[Federico Pinedo]], Marta Varela and [[Fernando Solanas|Pino Solanas]]).<ref>[http://www.senado.gov.ar/senadores/listados/listaSenadoRes Senate of the Nation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213155/http://www.senado.gov.ar/senadores/listados/listaSenadoRes |date=4 March 2016 }}. Retrieved 5 July 2017.</ref> The people of Buenos Aires also elect 25 national deputies to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]].

===Port===
{{main|Port of Buenos Aires}}
The port of Buenos Aires is one of the busiest in South America; navigable rivers by way of the Rio de la Plata connect the port to north-east Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. As a result, it serves as the distribution hub for a vast area of the south-eastern region of the continent. The [[Port of Buenos Aires]] handles over 11 million [[Tonne|revenue tons]] annually,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puertobuenosaires.gov.ar/estadisticas/11-2010w.pdf |title=Puerto Buenos Aires: Estadísticas |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706083833/http://www.puertobuenosaires.gov.ar/estadisticas/11-2010w.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2011 }}</ref> and [[Dock Sud]], just south of the city proper, handles another 17 million metric tons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/ARG_Port_of_Dock_Sud_187.php |title=Dock Sud |publisher=World Port Source |accessdate=2 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420011546/http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/ARG_Port_of_Dock_Sud_187.php |archive-date=20 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tax collection related to the port has caused many political problems in the past, including a [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector|conflict in 2008]] that led to protests and a strike in the agricultural sector after the government raised export [[tariff]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Argentina ends grain tax hike |work=Los Angeles Times |date=19 July 2008 |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-farmers19-2008jul19,0,2489386.story |first=Patrick J. |last=McDonnell |accessdate=19 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803120812/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-farmers19-2008jul19%2C0%2C2489386.story |archive-date=3 August 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

===Services===
The city's services sector is diversified and well-developed by international standards, and accounts for 76% of its economy (compared to 59% for all of Argentina's).<ref name=city>{{cite web|url=http://buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/hacienda/sis_estadistico/buscador.php?tipopubli=4&subtipopubli=&titulo=&anio=2008&mes= |title=City of Buenos Aires Statistical Annual (2008) |publisher=Buenosaires.gov.ar |accessdate=9 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919193252/http://buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/hacienda/sis_estadistico/buscador.php?tipopubli=4&subtipopubli=&titulo=&anio=2008&mes= |archive-date=19 September 2009 }}</ref> Advertising, in particular, plays a prominent role in the export of services at home and abroad. The financial and real-estate services sector is the largest, however, and contributes to 31% of the city's economy. Finance (about a third of this) in Buenos Aires is especially important to Argentina's banking system, accounting for nearly half the nation's bank deposits and lending.<ref name=city/> Nearly 300 hotels and another 300 [[hostel]]s and bed & breakfasts are [[Tourism in Buenos Aires|licensed for tourism]], and nearly half the rooms available were in four-star establishments or higher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/hacienda/sis_estadistico/SEC_abril_20082.pdf |title=abril 2008 para pdf.indd |accessdate=9 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024201444/http://buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/hacienda/sis_estadistico/SEC_abril_20082.pdf |archive-date=24 October 2012 }}</ref>

===Manufacturing===
Manufacturing is, nevertheless, still prominent in the city's economy (16%) and, concentrated mainly in the southern part of the city. It benefits as much from high local purchasing power and a large local supply of skilled labor as it does from its relationship to massive agriculture and industry just outside the city limits. Construction activity in Buenos Aires has historically been among the most accurate indicators of national economic fortunes, and since 2006 around {{convert|3|e6m2|e6ft2|abbr=off}} of construction has been authorized annually.<ref name=city/> Meat, dairy, grain, tobacco, wool and leather products are processed or manufactured in the [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires metro area]]. Other leading industries are automobile manufacturing, oil refining, metalworking, machine building and the production of textiles, chemicals, clothing and beverages.

===Government finances===
The city's budget, per Mayor Macri's 2011 proposal, included US$6&nbsp;billion in revenues and US$6.3&nbsp;billion in expenditures. The city relies on local income and capital gains taxes for 61% of its revenues, while federal revenue sharing contributes 11%, [[property tax]]es, 9%, and vehicle taxes, 6%. Other revenues include user fees, fines and gambling duties. The city devotes 26% of its budget to education, 22% for health, 17% for [[public service]]s and infrastructure, 16% for social welfare and culture, 12% in administrative costs and 4% for law enforcement. Buenos Aires maintains low debt levels and its service requires less than 3% of the budget.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://estatico.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/hacienda/presupuesto2011/pdf/02_proyecto_de_ley_de_presupuesto_2011.pdf |title= Presupuesto 2011 |accessdate= 25 February 2011 |archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/6BcKHPRaX?url=http://estatico.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/hacienda/presupuesto2011/pdf/02_proyecto_de_ley_de_presupuesto_2011.pdf |archive-date= 23 October 2012 |url-status= live }}</ref>

The first major artistic movements in Argentina coincided with the first signs of political liberty in the country, such as the 1913 sanction of the secret ballot and universal male suffrage, the [[Hipólito Yrigoyen|first president to be popularly elected]] (1916), and the cultural revolution that involved the University Reform of 1918.

Known as ''[[Rioplatense Spanish]]'', Buenos Aires' Spanish (as that of other cities like [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] and [[Montevideo]], Uruguay) is characterised by ''[[voseo]]'', ''[[yeísmo]]'' and aspiration of ''s'' in various contexts. It is heavily influenced by the dialects of Spanish spoken in [[Andalusia]] and [[Murcia]].

In the early 20th century, Argentina absorbed millions of immigrants, many of them Italians, who spoke mostly in their local dialects (mainly Neapolitan, [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Genoese language|Genoese]]). Their adoption of Spanish was gradual, creating a [[pidgin]] of Italian dialects and Spanish that was called ''[[cocoliche]]''. Its usage declined around the 1950s. A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of [[National Scientific and Technical Research Council|CONICET]] and the [[University of Toronto]] showed that the [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of ''[[porteño]]'' is closer to the [[Neapolitan language]] of Italy than to any other spoken language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/762441-napolitanos-y-portenos-unidos-por-el-acento |title=Napolitanos y porteños, unidos por el acento |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |accessdate=13 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725031043/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/762441-napolitanos-y-portenos-unidos-por-el-acento |archive-date=25 July 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Many Spanish immigrants were from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and Spaniards are still generically referred to in Argentina as ''gallegos'' ([[Galician people|Galicians]]). [[Galician language]], cuisine and culture had a major presence in the city for most of the 20th century. In recent years, descendants of Galician immigrants have led a mini-boom in [[Celtic music]] (which also highlighted the [[Y Wladfa|Welsh traditions of Patagonia]]).

[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] was commonly heard in Buenos Aires, especially in the [[Balvanera]] garment district and in [[Villa Crespo]] until the 1960s. Most of the newer immigrants learn Spanish quickly and assimilate into city life.

The ''[[Lunfardo]]'' [[argot]] originated within the prison population, and in time spread to all ''porteños''. Lunfardo uses words from Italian dialects, from [[Brazilian Portuguese]], from African and Caribbean languages and even from English. Lunfardo employs humorous tricks such as inverting the syllables within a word ([[vesre]]). Today, Lunfardo is mostly heard in tango lyrics;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~tango/Articles/2001_Economist.pdf|title=A sense of where you were|website=Web.ics.purdue.edu|accessdate=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909015550/http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~tango/Articles/2001_Economist.pdf|archive-date=9 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> the slang of the younger generations has been evolving away from it.

[[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine films]] were exported across Latin America, specially [[Libertad Lamarque]]'s melodramas, and the comedies of [[Luis Sandrini]] and [[Niní Marshall]]. The popularity of local cinema in the Spanish-speaking world played a key role in the massification of tango music. [[Carlos Gardel]], an iconic figure of tango and Buenos Aires, became an international star by starring in several films during that era.

In response to large studio productions, the "Generation of the 60s" appeared, a group of filmmakers that produced the first [[Modernism|modernist]] films in Argentina during that early years of that decade.

At that time, the country was under a [[military dictatorship]] after the [[coup d'état]] known as [[Argentine Revolution]]. One of the most notable films of these movement is ''[[The Hour of the Furnaces|La hora de los hornos]]'' (1968) by [[Fernando Solanas]]. During the period of democracy between 1973 and 1975, the local cinema experienced critical and commercial success, with titles including ''[[Juan Moreira (1973 film)|Juan Moreira]]'' (1973), ''[[La Patagonia rebelde]]'' (1974), ''[[La Raulito]]'' (1975), and ''[[The Truce (1974 film)|La tregua]]'' (1974) – which became the first Argentine film nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. However, because of censorship and a new military government, Argentine cinema stalled until the return of democracy in the 1980s. This generation – known as "Argentine Cinema in Liberty and Democracy" – were mostly young or postponed filmmakers, and gained international notoriety. ''[[Camila (film)|Camila]]'' (1984) by [[María Luisa Bemberg]] was nominated for the Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards, and [[Luis Puenzo]]'s ''[[La historia oficial]]'' (1985) was the first Argentine film to receive the award.

[[File:Cabildo de Buenos Aires, calle Bolivar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|View of Bolívar Street facing the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo|Cabildo]] and [[Avenida Roque Sáenz Peña|Diagonal Norte]], on Buenos Aires' historical center. The city's characteristic convergence of diverse architectural styles can be seen, including [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial]], [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] and [[modernist architecture]].]]
Buenos Aires architecture is characterized by its eclectic nature, with elements resembling [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]]. There is a mix, due to [[Immigration in Argentina|immigration]], of [[Spanish colonial architecture|Colonial]], [[Art Deco]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Neo-Gothic]], and [[House of Bourbon|French Bourbon]] styles.<ref>[http://www.bue.gov.ar/?ncMenu=49 Portal Oficial de Turismo de Buenos Aires: Arquitectura] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927152524/http://www.bue.gov.ar/?ncMenu=49 |date=27 September 2011 }} (Spanish)</ref> Italian and French influences increased after the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] at the beginning of the 19th century, though the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century.

Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, when European influences penetrated into the country, reflected by several buildings of Buenos Aires such as the Iglesia Santa Felicitas by Ernesto Bunge; the Palace of Justice, the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]], all of them by [[Vittorio Meano]], and the [[Teatro Colón]], by [[Francesco Tamburini]] and [[Vittorio Meano]].

The simplicity of the ''[[Río de la Plata|Rioplatense]]'' [[baroque|baroque style]] can be clearly seen in Buenos Aires through the works of Italian architects such as André Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of [[Saint Ignatius Church (Buenos Aires)|San Ignacio]], [[Our Lady of the Pillar|Nuestra Señora del Pilar]], the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Cathedral]] and the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo|Cabildo]].

In 1912, the Basilica del Santisimo Sacramento was opened to the public. Totally built by the generous donation of [[Mercedes Castellanos de Anchorena]], a member of Argentina's most prominent family, the church is an excellent example of French neo-classicism. With extremely high-grade decorations in its interior, the magnificent Mutin-Cavaillé coll organ (the biggest ever installed in an Argentine church with more than four-thousand tubes and four manuals) presided the nave. The altar is full of marble, and was the biggest ever built in South America at that time.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Celebran-anos-cripta-Santisimo-Sacramento_0_504549647.html Clarín.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6A0qukD5P?url=http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Celebran-anos-cripta-Santisimo-Sacramento_0_504549647.html |date=18 August 2012 }} "Celebran hoy los 100 años de la cripta del Santísimo Sacramento" 23 June 2011</ref>

In 1919, the construction of Palacio Barolo began. This was South America's tallest building at the time, and was the first Argentine skyscraper built with concrete (1919–1923).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbarolo.com.ar |title=Palacio Barolo |publisher=Pbarolo.com.ar |accessdate=15 September 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68cqjfE9L?url=http://www.pbarolo.com.ar/ |archive-date=23 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The building was equipped with 9 elevators, plus a 20-metre high lobby hall with paintings in the ceiling and Latin phrases embossed in golden bronze letters. A 300,000-candela beacon was installed at the top (110 m), making the building visible even from Uruguay. In 2009, the Barolo Palace went under an exhaustive restoration, and the beacon was made operational again.

In 1936, the [[Kavanagh building]] was inaugurated, with {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=off}} height, 12 elevators (provided by Otis) and the world's first central air-conditioning system (provided by north-American company "Carrier"), is still an architectural landmark in Buenos Aires.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/capital_federal/Vivir-Kavanagh-lujo-vecinos-perfil_0_523147815.html Clarín.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222031107/http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/capital_federal/Vivir-Kavanagh-lujo-vecinos-perfil_0_523147815.html |date=22 February 2012 }} "Vivir en el Kavanagh, un lujo para vecinos de perfil bajo" 24 July 2011</ref>

The architecture of the second half of the 20th century continued to reproduce French [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassic]] models, such as the headquarters of the Banco de la Nación Argentina built by [[Alejandro Bustillo]], and the Museo Hispanoamericano de Buenos Aires of Martín Noel. However, since the 1930s, the influence of [[Le Corbusier]] and European [[rationalism]] consolidated in a group of young architects from the [[National University of Tucumán|University of Tucumán]], among whom [[Amancio Williams]] stands out. The construction of skyscrapers proliferated in Buenos Aires until the 1950s. Newer modern high-technology buildings by Argentine architects in the last years of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st include the Le Parc Tower by Mario Álvarez, the Torre Fortabat by Sánchez Elía and the [[Repsol-YPF tower]] by [[César Pelli]].

==Education==
{{See also|Education in Argentina}}

===Primary education===
Primary education comprise grades 1–7. Most primary schools in the city still adhere to the traditional seven-year primary school, but kids can do grades 1–6 if their high schools lasts 6 years, such as [[ORT Argentina]].

===Secondary education===
[[File:Colegio Nacional Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|right|[[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]], a public high school in Buenos Aires, and it is one of the most prestigious in Argentina and Latin America.]]
[[File:UBA-Facultad-Derecho.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Buenos Aires]]' Law School in [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]]]]
Secondary education in Argentina is called ''Polimodal'' ("polymodal", that is, having multiple modes), since it allows the student to choose their orientation. Polimodal is usually 3 years of schooling, although some schools have a fourth year. Before entering the first year of polimodal, students choose an orientation, among these five: ''Humanities and Social Sciences'', ''Economics and Management of Organizations'','' Art and Design'', ''Health and Sport'' and ''Biology and Natural Sciences''.

Nevertheless, in Buenos Aires, secondary education consists of 5 years, called from 1st year to 5th year, as opposed to primary education's 1st to 7th grade. Most schools do not require students to choose their orientation, as they study the basic such as maths, biology, art, history and technology, but there are schools that do, whether they are orientated to a certain profession or they have orientations to choose from when they reach a specific year.

Some high schools depend on the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and these require an admission course when students are taking the last year of high school. These high schools are [[Instituto Libre de Segunda Enseñanza|ILSE]], [[CNBA]], [[Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini]] and Escuela de Educación Técnica Profesional en Producción Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria (School of Professional Technique Education in Agricultural and Agri-food Production). The last two do have a specific orientation.

In December 2006 the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Argentine National Congress|Argentine Congress]] passed a new National Education Law restoring the old system of primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 13 years. The government vowed to put the law in effect gradually, starting in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/12/14/um/m-01327811.htm |title=Clarín article |publisher=Clarin.com |date=14 December 2006 |accessdate=9 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906014337/http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/12/14/um/m-01327811.htm |archive-date=6 September 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Visitors have many options such as going to a tango show, an [[estancia]] in the [[Buenos Aires Province|Province of Buenos Aires]], or enjoying the traditional [[asado]]. New tourist circuits have recently evolved, devoted to Argentines such as [[Carlos Gardel]], [[Eva Perón]] or [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. Before 2011, due to the favourable exchange rate, its shopping centres such as Alto Palermo, Paseo Alcorta, [[Patio Bullrich]], [[Abasto de Buenos Aires]] and [[Galerías Pacífico]] were frequently visited by tourists. The exchange rate today has hampered tourism and shopping in particular. Notable consumer brands such as Burberry and Louis Vuitton have abandoned the country due to the exchange rate and import restrictions. The city also plays host to musical festivals, some of the largest of which are [[Quilmes Rock]], [[Creamfields BA]], [[Ultra Music Festival]] (Buenos Aires) and the [[Buenos Aires Jazz Festival]].

The most popular tourist sites are found in the historic core of the city, in the [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]] and [[San Telmo]] neighborhoods. Buenos Aires was conceived around the [[Plaza de Mayo]], the colony's administrative center. To the east of the square is the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'', the official seat of the [[executive branch]] of the government of Argentina. To the north, the ''[[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]]'' which has stood in the same location since colonial times, and the [[Banco de la Nación Argentina]] building, a parcel of land originally owned by [[Juan de Garay]]. Other important colonial institutions were [[Buenos Aires Cabildo|Cabildo]], to the west, which was renovated during the construction of [[Avenida de Mayo]] and Julio A. Roca. To the south is the ''Congreso de la Nación'' (National Congress), which currently houses the ''Academia Nacional de la Historia'' (National Academy of History). Lastly, to the northwest, is City Hall.

===Parks===
[[File:ID 229 Jardín Japones 5449.jpg|thumb|[[Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens]].]]

Buenos Aires has over 250 parks and green spaces, the largest concentration of which are on the city's eastern side in the Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo and Belgrano neighbourhoods. Some of the most important are:

*[[Parque Tres de Febrero]], designed by urbanist Jordán Czeslaw Wysocki and architect [[Julio Dormal]], the park was inaugurated on 11 November 1875. The dramatic economic growth of Buenos Aires afterwards helped to lead to its transfer to the municipal domain in 1888, whereby [[French Argentine]] urbanist [[Carlos Thays]] was commissioned to expand and further beautify the park, between 1892 and 1912. Thays designed the [[Buenos Aires Zoo|Zoological Gardens]], the [[Buenos Aires Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]], the adjoining Plaza Italia and the Rose Garden.
*[[Buenos Aires Botanical Garden|Botanical Gardens]], designed by French architect and landscape designer [[Carlos Thays]], the garden was inaugurated on 7 September 1898. Thays and his family lived in an [[England|English]] style mansion, located within the gardens, between 1892 and 1898, when he served as director of parks and walks in the city. The mansion, built in 1881, is currently the main building of the complex.
*[[Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens]] Is the largest of its type in the World, outside Japan. Completed in 1967, the gardens were inaugurated on occasion of a State visit to Argentina by Crown Prince [[Akihito]] and Princess [[Empress Michiko|Michiko]] of Japan.
*[[Plaza de Mayo]] Since being the scene of [[May Revolution|25 May 1810 revolution]] that led to independence, the plaza has been a hub of political life in Argentina.
*[[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]] is a park located in the [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] neighbourhood of the city. Situated at the northern end of pedestrianized [[Florida Street]], the park is bounded by [[Avenida del Libertador|Libertador Ave.]] (N), Maipú St. (W), [[Santa Fe Avenue]] (S), and Leandro Alem Av. (E).

===LGBT tourism===

Buenos Aires has become a recipient of [[LGBT tourism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/qa-in-buenos-aires-gay-friendly-spots/?_r=0|title=Q&A: Gay-Friendly Spots in Buenos Aires|last1=Haljuci|first1=Rusha|date=24 August 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|access-date=29 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208055820/http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/qa-in-buenos-aires-gay-friendly-spots/?_r=0|archive-date=8 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="gayclarin">{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/11/01/h-05015.htm|title=Buenos Aires, nueva capital del turismo gay de Sudamérica|last1=Santagati|first1=Adriana|date=1 November 2003|work=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]|publisher=Clarín Group|access-date=29 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105115135/http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/11/01/h-05015.htm|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> due to the existence of some [[gay-friendly]] sites and the legalising of [[same-sex marriage]] on 15 July 2010, making it the first country in [[Latin America]], the second in the [[Americas]], and the tenth in the world to do so.

In 2015, the [[World Health Organization]] cited Argentina as an exemplary country for providing transgender rights. Despite these legal advances, however, homophobia continues to be a hotly contested social issue in the city and the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20180206-activists-hold-collective-kiss-buenos-aires-protest-homophobia|title=Activists hold collective kiss in Buenos Aires to protest homophobia|date=6 February 2018|website=fRance24.com|accessdate=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927113532/https://www.france24.com/en/20180206-activists-hold-collective-kiss-buenos-aires-protest-homophobia|archive-date=27 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Hotels===

Buenos Aires has various types of accommodation, from luxurious five star to budget located in neighborhoods that are further from the city centre, although the transportation system allows easy and inexpensive access to the city.

There were, {{as of|2008|February|lc=y}}, 23 five-star, 61 four-star, 59 three-star and 87 two or one-star hotels, as well as 25 [[boutique hotel]]s and 39 [[apart-hotel]]s; another 298 [[hostel]]s, [[bed & breakfast]]s, [[vacation rental]]s and other non-hotel establishments were registered in the city. In all, nearly 27,000 rooms were available for tourism in Buenos Aires, of which about 12,000 belonged to four-star, five-star, or boutique hotels. Establishments of a higher category typically enjoy the city's highest occupation rates.<ref>[http://buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/hacienda/sis_estadistico/SEC_abril_20082.pdf Buenos Aires Statistical Monthly, April 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024201444/http://buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/hacienda/sis_estadistico/SEC_abril_20082.pdf |date=24 October 2012 }}</ref> The majority of the hotels are located in the central part of the city, in close proximity to most main tourist attractions.

[[File:Monumento a La Carta Magna y las Cuatro Regiones Argentinas - de los españoles 4.JPG|alt=|thumb|[[Monument to the Carta Magna and Four Regions of Argentina]] in the [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] neighbourhood.]]

*[[Buenos Aires Cabildo|Cabildo]] was used as the government house during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial times]] of the [[Viceroyalty of the River Plate]]. The original building was finished in 1610 but was soon found to be too small and had to be expanded. Over the years many changes have been made. In 1940, the architect Mario Buschiazzo reconstructed the colonial features of the Cabildo using various original documents.
*[[Kavanagh building]] is located at 1065 [[Florida Street|Florida St.]] in the [[barrios of Buenos Aires|barrio]] of [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]], overlooking [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]]. It was constructed in the 1930s in the Rationalist style, by the architects Gregorio Sánchez, Ernesto Lagos and Luis María de la Torre and was finished in 1936. The building is characterised by the austerity of its lines, the lack of external ornamentation and its large prismatic volumes. It was declared a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|national historical monument]] in 1999,<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/1999/04/23/e-03901d.htm 'El Kavanagh, entre los protegidos'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202074246/http://www.clarin.com/diario/1999/04/23/e-03901d.htm |date=2 December 2009 }}, [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|''Clarín'']], 23 April 1999 {{in lang|es}}</ref> and is one of the most impressive architectural masterpieces of Buenos Aires. Standing at a height of 120 m, it still retains its impact against the modern skyline of the city. In 1939 its façade received an award from the American Institute of Architects.<ref>[http://www.bue.gov.ar/recorridos/index.php?menu_id=18&info=imperdibles&atractivo=239&orden=11 Edificio Kavanagh]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
*[[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] is the main Catholic church in Buenos Aires.

It is the mother church of the [[Archdiocese of Buenos Aires]].
*[[National Library of the Argentine Republic|National Library]] is the largest library in Argentina and one of the most important in the [[Americas]].
*[[Obelisk of Buenos Aires|The Obelisk]] was built in May 1936 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first founding of the city. It is located in the center of the ''[[Plaza de la República (Buenos Aires)|Plaza de la República]]'' (Republic Square), the spot where the [[Flag of Argentina|Argentine flag]] was flown for the first time in Buenos Aires, at the intersection of [[9 de Julio Avenue|Nueve de Julio]] and Corrientes avenues. Its total height is {{convert|67|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and its base area is {{convert|49|m2|ft2|abbr=off|sp=us}}.

==Transport==

===Airports===
[[File:Aeroparque Jorge Newberry-Overview (by Darío Crusafón).jpg|thumb|Overview of the [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery]] airport, the only within the city limits.]]
The [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport]], commonly known as ''Ezeiza Airport'', is located in the suburb of [[Ezeiza Partido|Ezeiza]], in Buenos Aires Province, approximately 22&nbsp;km south of the city. This airport handles most international air traffic to and from Argentina as well as some domestic flights.

The [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery]] airport, located in the Palermo district of the city next to the riverbank, is the only within the city limits and serves primarily domestic traffic within Argentina and some regional flights to neighboring South American countries.

Other minor airports near the city are [[El Palomar Airport]], which is located 18&nbsp;km west of the city and handles some scheduled domestic flights to a number of destinations in Argentina, and the smaller [[San Fernando Airport (Argentina)|San Fernando Airport]] which serves only [[general aviation]].

===Local roads and personal transport===
Buenos Aires is based on a square, rectangular [[grid plan|grid]] pattern, save for natural barriers or the relatively rare developments explicitly designed otherwise (notably, the neighbourhood of [[Parque Chas]]). The rectangular grid provides for [[square (geometry)|square]] blocks named ''manzanas'', with a length of roughly {{convert|110|m|ft|0|abbr=off}}. Pedestrian zones in the [[central business district|city centre]], like [[Florida Street]] are partially [[Pedestrian zone|car-free]] and always bustling, access provided by bus and the [[Line C (Buenos Aires Underground)|Underground (subte) Line C]]. Buenos Aires, for the most part, is a very walkable city and the majority of residents in Buenos Aires use public transport.

Two diagonal [[Avenue Road|avenues]] in the city centre alleviate traffic and provide better access to [[Plaza de Mayo]]. Most avenues running into and out of the city centre are one-way and feature six or more lanes, with computer-controlled [[green wave]]s to speed up traffic outside of peak times.

The city's principal avenues include the {{convert|140|m|ft|0|adj=on}}-wide [[July 9 Avenue]], the over-{{convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}-long [[Rivadavia Avenue]],<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/02/26/laciudad/h-05615.htm 'Avenida Rivadavia:Un largo recorrido de contrastes'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627142420/http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/02/26/laciudad/h-05615.htm |date=27 June 2006 }} by Nora Sánchez, [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|''Clarín'']], 26 February 2006</ref> and [[Corrientes Avenue]], the main thoroughfare of culture and entertainment.

In the 1940s and 1950s the [[General Paz Avenue]] beltway that surrounds the city along its border with [[Buenos Aires Province]], and the freeways leading to the new [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|international airport]] and to the northern suburbs, heralded a new era for Buenos Aires traffic. Encouraged by pro-automaker policies that were pursued towards the end of the Perón (1955) and [[Arturo Frondizi|Frondizi]] administrations (1958–62) in particular, auto sales nationally grew from an average of 30,000 during the 1920–57 era to around 250,000 in the 1970s and over 600,000 in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |author=IntermediaSP. 2007 |url=http://www.adefa.com.ar/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990125093012/http://www.adefa.com.ar/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 January 1999 |title=ADEFA |publisher=ADEFA |accessdate=9 August 2009  }}</ref> Today, over 1.8&nbsp;million vehicles (nearly one-fifth of Argentina's total) are registered in Buenos Aires.<ref>[http://www.dnrpa.gov.ar/bolesta1/boletin1021/Pagina%203.htm DNRPA]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603095216/http://www.dnrpa.gov.ar/bolesta1/boletin1021/Pagina%203.htm |date=3 June 2009 }}</ref>

Toll motorways opened in the late 1970s by mayor [[Osvaldo Cacciatore]] provided fast access to the city centre and are today used by over a million vehicles daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mecon.gov.ar/download/infoeco/actividad_ied.xls#'1.10 |title=SS PP'!A1 |accessdate=9 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920005341/http://www.mecon.gov.ar/download/infoeco/actividad_ied.xls |archive-date=20 September 2009 }}</ref> Cacciatore likewise had financial district streets (roughly one square km in area) closed to private cars during daytime. Most major avenues are, however, [[gridlock]]ed at peak hours. Following the [[Economic history of Argentina|economic mini-boom of the 1990s]], record numbers started [[commuting]] by car and congestion increased, as did the time-honored [[Culture of Argentina|Argentine custom]] of taking weekends off in the countryside.

The [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter networks|Buenos Aires commuter network]] system is very extensive: every day more than 1.3&nbsp;million people [[commuting|commute]] to the Argentine capital. These suburban trains operate between 4&nbsp;am and 1&nbsp;am. The Buenos Aires commuter rail network also connects the city with long-distance rail services to [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], among other metropolitan areas. There are four principal [[Rail terminal|terminals]] for both long-distance and [[Commuter rail|local]] passenger services in the city centre: [[Constitución railway station|Constitucion]], [[Retiro railway station|Retiro]], [[Federico Lacroze railway station|Federico Lacroze]] and [[Once railway station|Once]], while [[Buenos Aires Belgrano Sur Line railway station|Buenos Aires station]] is a minor terminus.

Commuter rail in the city is mostly operated by the state-owned [[Trenes Argentinos]], though the [[Urquiza Line]] and [[Belgrano Norte Line]] are operated by private companies [[Metrovías]] and [[Ferrovías]] respectively.<ref>[https://www.sofse.gob.ar/acuerdos/cuadro.php Operacion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721193028/http://www.sofse.gob.ar/acuerdos/cuadro.php |date=21 July 2015 }} – SOFSE</ref><ref>[http://www.ferrovias.com.ar/institucional/index.php?sbmn=1 Nuestra Historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831115237/http://www.ferrovias.com.ar/institucional/index.php?sbmn=1 |date=31 August 2015 }} – Ferrovias</ref><ref>[http://www.metrovias.com.ar/Ferrocarriles Ferrocarriles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716194148/http://www.metrovias.com.ar/Ferrocarriles |date=16 July 2015 }} – Metrovias</ref> All services had been operated by [[Ferrocarriles Argentinos]] until the company's [[Railway privatisation in Argentina|privatisation in 1993]], and were then operated by a series of private companies until the lines were put back under state control following a series of high-profile accidents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/freight/single-view/view/all-concessions-revoked.html|accessdate=10 June 2013|title=ALL concessions revoked|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611201427/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/freight/single-view/view/all-concessions-revoked.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-220578-2013-05-22.html "Nueva empresa estatal para el Belgrano Cargas"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124321/http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-220578-2013-05-22.html |date=24 September 2015 }}, ''Página/12'', 23 May 2013</ref>

====Tramways====
{{Main|Trams in Buenos Aires}}
Buenos Aires had an extensive [[Tram|street railway (tram)]] system with over {{convert|857|km|abbr=on}} of track, which was dismantled during the 1960s in favour of bus transportation, but surface rail transport has made a small comeback in some parts of the city. The [[PreMetro E2 (Buenos Aires)|PreMetro]] or Line E2 is a {{convert|7.4|km|abbr=on}} [[light rail]] line that connects with [[Line E (Buenos Aires Underground)|Underground Line E]] at Plaza de los Virreyes station and runs to General Savio and Centro Cívico. It is operated by [[Metrovías]]. The official inauguration took place on 27 August 1987.

A {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} modern [[tram]]way, the [[Tranvía del Este]], opened in 2007 in the [[Puerto Madero]] district, using two tramcars on temporary loan. However, plans to extend the line and acquire a fleet of trams did not come to fruition, and declining [[patronage (transport)|patronage]] led to the line's closure in October 2012.<ref name="taut-2013jan">''[[Tramways & Urban Transit]]'', January 2013, p. 29.

====Buses====
[[File:GCBA - Metrobus del Bajo (18).jpg|thumb|[[Metrobus (Buenos Aires)|Metrobus]], Paseo del Bajo.]]

There are over 150 city bus lines called ''[[Colectivo]]s'', each one managed by an individual company. These compete with each other, and attract exceptionally high use with virtually no public financial support.<ref name="trb.metapress">{{cite web |url=http://trb.metapress.com/content/v5542g6mh27j6u44/ |title=Transportation Research Board, Buenos Aires Colectivo Buses and Experience with Privatization |publisher=Trb.metapress.com |date=15 January 2007 |accessdate=9 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715220622/http://trb.metapress.com/content/v5542g6mh27j6u44/ |archive-date=15 July 2012  }}</ref> Their frequency makes them equal to the underground systems of other cities, but buses cover a far wider area than the underground system. Colectivos in Buenos Aires do not have a fixed timetable, but run from four to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day. With inexpensive tickets and extensive routes, usually no further than four blocks from commuters' residences, the colectivo is the most popular mode of transport around the city.<ref name="trb.metapress"/>
