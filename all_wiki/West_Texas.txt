'''West Texas''' is a loosely defined part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], generally encompassing the [[desert climate|arid]] and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] lands west of a line drawn between the cities of [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], and [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]].

No consensus exists on the boundary between [[East Texas]] and West Texas.<ref>Cochran, M., Lumpkin, J. and Heflin, R. 1999. ''West Texas: a portrait of its people and their raw and wondrous land''. Lubbock: [[Texas Tech University Press]], 176 pp.</ref> While most Texans understand these terms, no  boundaries are officially recognized and any two individuals are likely to describe the boundaries of these regions differently. [[Walter Prescott Webb]],  American historian and geographer, suggested that the [[98th meridian west|98th meridian]] separates East and West Texas;<ref>Webb, W.P. 1935. ''The Texas Rangers: a century of frontier defense''. New York: Houghton Mifflin Co., 583 pp.</ref> Texas writer A.C. Greene proposed that West Texas extends west of the [[Brazos River]].<ref>Greene, A.C.  1998. ''Sketches from the five states of Texas''. College Station: [[Texas A&M University Press]], 176 pp.</ref>

West Texas is often subdivided according to distinct physiographic features. The portion of West Texas that lies west of the [[Pecos River]] is often referred to as "Far West Texas" or the "[[Trans-Pecos]]", a term first introduced in 1887 by Texas geologist [[Robert T. Hill]].<ref>Hill, R.T. 1887. The topography and geology of the Cross Timbers and surrounding regions in Northern Texas. ''The American Journal of Science'', 3rd Series, 33:291–303.</ref> The Trans-Pecos lies within the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], and is the most arid portion of the state.  Another part of West Texas is the [[Llano Estacado]], a vast region of high, level plains extending into [[Eastern New Mexico]] and the [[Texas Panhandle]]. To the east of the Llano Estacado lies the “[[Red beds|redbed country]]” of the [[Osage Plains|Rolling Plains]] and to the south of the Llano Estacado lies the [[Edwards Plateau]]. The Rolling Plains and the Edwards Plateau subregions act as transitional zones between eastern and western Texas.

==Climate==
West Texas receives much less [[rain]]fall than the rest of Texas and has an [[desert climate|arid]] or [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] climate, requiring most of its scant [[agriculture]] to be heavily dependent on [[irrigation]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bubenik|first=Travis|date=2018-04-15|title=Texas Could Look Increasingly Like West Texas, Climate Study Says|url=https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2018/04/15/278952/texas-could-look-increasingly-like-west-texas-climate-study-says/|access-date=2020-10-20|website=Houston Public Media|language=en-US}}</ref> This irrigation, and water taken out farther north for the needs of El Paso and [[Ciudad Juárez|Juarez, Mexico]], has reduced the once mighty [[Rio Grande]] to a stream in some places, even dry at times. Much of West Texas has rugged terrain, including many small mountain ranges, while most parts of the state are at or near sea level. The northern parts of West Texas (notably the Texas Panhandle) and the higher elevations of the mountain ranges of the Trans-Pecos region are prone to occasionally heavy snowfall during winter, while snow is less common in other areas of West Texas.

==Politics==
Except for the Trans-Pecos region, West Texas has become well known as a stronghold for [[Conservatism|conservative]] politics. Some of the most heavily [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] counties in the United States are located in the region. Former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] spent most of his childhood in West Texas.

The Panhandle and several counties in the [[Midland-Odessa]] area were some of the first parts of Texas to abandon the state's "[[Solid South]]" [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] roots; nine counties{{efn|West Texas counties voting Republican at every election since 1952 comprise [[Ector County, Texas|Ector County]], [[Gray County, Texas|Gray County]], [[Hansford County, Texas|Hansford County]], [[Hutchinson County, Texas|Hutchinson County]], [[Lipscomb County, Texas|Lipscomb County]], [[Midland County, Texas|Midland County]], [[Ochiltree County, Texas|Ochiltree County]], [[Randall County, Texas|Randall County]], and [[Roberts County, Texas|Roberts County]].}} have not supported a Democrat for president since [[United States presidential election in Texas, 1948|1948]]. The Rolling Plains to the east remained Democratic for substantially longer: although [[Walter Mondale]]'s [[United States presidential election in Texas, 1984|1984 campaign]] lost Texas by 27.50%, he won five counties in this region.{{efn|West Texas Plains "Bible Belt" counties voting for Mondale in 1984 were [[Cottle County, Texas|Cottle County]] (which was in fact one of 130 counties nationwide to vote for [[George McGovern]] in 1972), [[Dickens County, Texas|Dickens County]], [[Fisher County, Texas|Fisher County]], [[Stonewall County, Texas|Stonewall County]] and [[Swisher County, Texas|Swisher County]].}} However, since 2000 this region has swung very rapidly towards the Republican Party due to its population's intransigent opposition to the liberal social policies of the Democratic Party<ref>Cohn, Nate; [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/upshot/southern-whites-loyalty-to-gop-nearing-that-of-blacks-to-democrats.html 'Demographic Shift: Southern Whites' Loyalty to G.O.P. Nearing That of Blacks to Democrats'], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 24, 2014</ref> and by 2016 has nearly the same [[Cook PVI]] as the Panhandle.

==Economy==
Major industries include [[livestock]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] production, [[textiles]] such as [[cotton]], [[cereal|grain]], and because of very large military installations such as [[Fort Bliss]], the [[Defense contractor|defense industry]]. [[Wind power in Texas|West Texas has become notable]] for its numerous [[wind turbine]]s producing [[Environmental effects of wind power|clean and alternative electricity]].

As of 2018, the West Texan economy was in a prosperous [[Business cycle|economic period]], which has been described as the "West Texas oil boom".<ref>{{cite news|last=Clifford|first=Krauss|date=March 28, 2018|title=$9.5 Billion Purchase by Concho Is Latest Sign of West Texas Oil Boom|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/business/energy-environment/texas-oil-deal.html|work=New York Times|access-date=May 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Saphir|first=Ann|date=May 1, 2018|title=Boom in West Texas oil patch lifts wages, prices|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-record-economy-analysis/boom-in-west-texas-oil-patch-lifts-wages-prices-idUSKBN1I22TF|work=Reuters|access-date=May 15, 2018}}</ref>

==Sports==
West Texas does not have major league sports teams. Instead, the region has college teams such as [[Texas Tech Red Raiders]], [[UTEP Miners]], and [[Abilene Christian University Wildcats]], which play in [[NCAA Division I]], and [[NCAA Division II]] teams of the [[West Texas A&M Buffaloes]], the [[Texas–Permian Basin Falcons]], and the [[Lubbock Christian Chaparrals and Lady Chaps]]. El Paso also hosts the [[El Paso Chihuahuas]], a AAA baseball team and Midland hosts the [[Midland RockHounds]], a double-A baseball team. Amarillo hosts another double-A baseball team, the [[Amarillo Sod Poodles]].  In 2019, the [[West Texas Rumbleweeds]] of the [[U.S. Arena Professional Soccer League]] began play. Junior hockey is also present in the region, with the [[Odessa Jackalopes]] of the Tier II North American Hockey League.

==West of the Pecos in popular culture==
{{See|West of the Pecos (disambiguation){{!}}West of the Pecos}}
{{Commons category|West Texas|<br />West Texas}}

"West of the Pecos" has become a [[Pars pro toto|metaphor]] for the universe of [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. "Fastest [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|draw]] west of the Pecos" and similar superlatives are a cliche, and the title character of ''[[Chisum]]'' observed "There’s no law west of Dodge, and no God west of the Pecos”.
