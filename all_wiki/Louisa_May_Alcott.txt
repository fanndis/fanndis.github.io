'''Louisa May Alcott''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|l|k|ə|t|,_|-|k|ɒ|t}}; November 29, 1832{{snd}}March 6, 1888) was an American novelist, short story writer and poet best known as the author of the novel ''[[Little Women]]'' (1868) and its sequels ''[[Little Men]]'' (1871) and ''[[Jo's Boys]]'' (1886).<ref name="Cullen-ugly" /> Raised in New England by her [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] parents, [[Abigail May]] and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], she grew up among many of the well-known intellectuals of the day, such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind 'Little Women' |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/masters/louisa-may-alcott/ |website=American Masters |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2 May 2020 |date=December 2009}}</ref>

Alcott's family suffered from financial difficulties, and while she worked to help support the family from an early age, she also sought an outlet in writing. She began to receive critical success for her writing in the 1860s. Early in her career, she sometimes used pen names such as '''A. M. Barnard''', under which she wrote lurid short stories and [[sensation novels]] for adults that focused on passion and revenge.<ref name="ualib">{{Cite web |date=2005 |title=Louisa May Alcott |url=https://bindings.lib.ua.edu/gallery/alcott.html |access-date=2020-09-03 |website=Publishers' Bindings Online, University of Alabama}}</ref>

Published in 1868, ''[[Little Women]]'' is set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], and is loosely based on Alcott's childhood experiences with her three sisters, [[Abigail May Alcott Nieriker]], [[Elizabeth Sewall Alcott]], and [[Anna Alcott Pratt]]. The novel was well-received at the time and is still popular today among both [[children's novel|children]] and adults. It has been adapted many times to the stage, film, and television.

Alcott was an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and a [[feminism|feminist]] and remained unmarried throughout her life. All her life she was active in such reform movements as temperance and women's suffrage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia Of The Arts|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0198691372|location=USA|pages=11}}</ref> She died from a [[stroke]], two days after her father died, in [[Boston]] on March 6, 1888.

In 1840, after several setbacks with the school, the Alcott family moved to a cottage on {{convert|2|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land, situated along the [[Sudbury River]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]].

After the collapse of the Utopian Fruitlands, they moved on to rented rooms and finally, with Abigail May Alcott's inheritance and financial help from Emerson, they purchased a homestead in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]]. They moved into the home they named "[[The Wayside|Hillside]]" on April 1, 1845, but had moved on by 1852 when it was sold to [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] who renamed it The Wayside. Moving 22 times in 30 years, the Alcotts returned to Concord once again in 1857 and moved into [[Orchard House]], a two-story clapboard farmhouse, in the spring of 1858.

[[File:Louisa May Alcott.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Louisa May Alcott]]
Alcott's early education included lessons from the [[naturalist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] who inspired her to write ''Thoreau's Flute'' based on her time at [[Walden Pond]].  Most of the education she received though, came from her father who was strict and believed in "the sweetness of self-denial."<ref name=showalter/> She also received some instruction from writers and educators such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Margaret Fuller]], and [[Julia Ward Howe]], all of whom were family friends. She later described these early years in a newspaper sketch entitled "Transcendental Wild Oats." The sketch was reprinted in the volume ''Silver Pitchers'' (1876), which relates the family's experiment in "plain living and high thinking" at Fruitlands.<ref name="EB1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Alcott, Louisa May|volume=1|page=529|last=Richardson|first=Charles F.}}</ref>

Poverty made it necessary for Alcott to go to work at an early age as a teacher, [[seamstress]], [[governess]], domestic helper, and writer. Her sisters also supported the family, working as seamstresses, while their mother took on social work among the [[Irish immigrants]]. Only the youngest, Abigail, was able to attend public school. Due to all of these pressures, writing became a creative and emotional outlet for Alcott.<ref name=showalter/> Her first book was ''[[Flower Fables]]'' (1849), a selection of tales originally written for Ellen Emerson, daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson.<ref name="EB1911"/> Alcott is quoted as saying "I wish I was rich, I was good, and we were all a happy family this day"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121831612|title=Alcott: 'Not The Little Woman You Thought She Was'|last=Reisen|first=Harriet|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=NPR|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}</ref> and was driven in life not to be poor.

In 1847 she and her family served as [[safe house|station masters]] on the [[Underground Railroad]], when they housed a [[fugitive slave]] for one week and had discussions with [[Frederick Douglass]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alcottfilm.com/louisa-may-alcott/life/|title=Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women, The Alcotts|publisher=Nancy Porter Productions, Inc.|year=2015}}</ref> Alcott read and admired the "[[Declaration of Sentiments]]", published by the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] on [[women's rights]], advocating for [[women's suffrage]] and became the first woman to register to vote in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] in a school board election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofmassachusetts.org/louisa-may-alcott-the-first-woman-registered-to-vote-in-concord/|title=Louisa May Alcott: The First Woman Registered to Vote in Concord|work=History of Massachusetts|author=Brooks, Rebecca Beatrice|date=September 19, 2011|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}</ref> The 1850s were hard times for the Alcotts, and in 1854 Louisa found solace at the [[The Boston Theatre|Boston Theatre]] where she wrote The Rival Prima Donnas, which she later burned due to a quarrel between the actresses on who would play what role. At one point in 1857, unable to find work and filled with such despair, Alcott contemplated suicide. During that year, she read [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s biography of [[Charlotte Brontë]] and found many parallels to her own life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2004/03/the-beguiling-bronte-sisters.html|title=The beguiling Bronte sisters.|last=Showalter|first=Elaine|date=2004-03-01|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Doyle|first=Christine|title=Louisa May Alcott and Charlotte Bronte: Transatlantic Translations|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|year=2003|isbn=1572332417|location=|pages=3}}</ref> In 1858, her younger sister Elizabeth died, and her older sister Anna married a man named John Pratt.

As an adult, Alcott was an abolitionist and a feminist. In 1860 Alcott began writing for the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. When the [[American Civil War]] broke out, she served as a nurse in the Union Hospital in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], [[District of Columbia|DC]], for six weeks in 1862–1863.<ref name="EB1911"/> She intended to serve three months as a nurse, but halfway through she contracted typhoid and became deathly ill, though she eventually recovered.

Her main character, Tribulation Periwinkle, showed a passage from innocence to maturity and is a "serious and eloquent witness".<ref name=showalter/> Her novel ''Moods'' (1864), based on her own experience, was also promising.<ref>Elbert 1984)</ref>

After her service as a nurse, Alcott's father wrote her a heartfelt poem titled "To Louisa May Alcott. From her father".<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://americanliterature.com/author/louisa-may-alcott/poem/to-louisa-may-alcott-by-her-father |title = To Louisa May Alcott. By Her Father}}</ref> The poem describes how proud her father is of her for working as a nurse and helping injured soldiers as well as bringing cheer and love into their home. He ends the poem by telling her she's in his heart for being a selfless faithful daughter. This poem was featured in the book "Louisa May Alcott: Her Life, Letters, and Journals (1889)". This poem is also featured in the book "Louisa May Alcott, the Children's Friend" that talks about her childhood and close relationship with her father.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/ |title = Oxford Art}}</ref>

"Since 1975, scholars of Louisa May Alcott have recovered thirty-three hitherto unknown gothic 'thrillers,' as she called them, published anonymously in popular magazines and 'story papers' such as ''[[The Flag of Our Union]]'', from 1863-1872."<ref>Rosemary F. Franklin, "Louisa May Alcott's Father(s) and "The Marble Woman"" in ''ATQ (The American Transcendental Quarterly)'' Vol. 13, No. 4 (1999).</ref> In the mid-1860s Alcott wrote passionate, fiery novels and sensational stories akin to those of English authors [[Wilkie Collins]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Braddon]] under the [[nom de plume]] '''A. M. Barnard'''. Among these are ''[[A Long Fatal Love Chase]]'' and ''Pauline's Passion and Punishment''. Her [[protagonist]]s for these books, like those of Collins and Braddon (who also included feminist characters in their writings), are strong, smart, and determined. She also produced stories for children, and after they became popular, she did not go back to writing for adults. Other books she wrote are the [[Novella|novelette]] ''A Modern Mephistopheles'' (1875), which people thought [[Julian Hawthorne]] wrote, and the semi-autobiographical novel ''Work'' (1873).

Catherine Ross Nickerson credits Alcott with creating one of the earliest works of [[detective fiction]], second only to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]" and his other [[Auguste Dupin]] stories, with the 1865 thriller "V.V., or Plots and Counterplots." A short story published anonymously by Alcott, the story concerns a Scottish aristocrat who tries to prove that a mysterious woman has killed his fiancee and cousin. The detective on the case, Antoine Dupres, is a parody of Poe's Dupin who is less concerned with solving the crime as he is in setting up a way to reveal the solution with a dramatic flourish.<ref name="Nickerson2010">{{cite book|last=Ross Nickerson|first=Catherine|editor=Catherine Ross Nickerson|title=The Cambridge Companion to American Crime Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlkUqB7wYpsC|date=8 July 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-13606-8|page=31|chapter=4: Women Writers Before 1960}}</ref>

Alcott became even more successful with the first part of ''[[Little Women]]: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy'' (1868), a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts, published by the [[Roberts Brothers (publishers)|Roberts Brothers]]. After Alcott came back to Boston after traveling Europe, she became an editor at a magazine, Merry's Museum. It was here where she met Thomas Niles who encouraged the writing of part one of ''Little Women.'' "In 1867, the magazine’s editor, Thomas Niles, asked her to write a book especially for girls."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Louisa May Alcott|url=https://bwht.org/louisa-may-alcott/|access-date=2020-11-17|website=bwht.org}}</ref> Alcott originally delayed writing the novel, seeing herself incapable of writing a story for girls, despite her publisher, Thomas Niles' urging her to do so.  Part two, or ''Part Second'', also known as ''[[Good Wives]]'' (1869), followed the March sisters into adulthood and marriage. ''[[Little Men]]'' (1871) detailed Jo's life at the Plumfield School that she founded with her husband Professor Bhaer at the conclusion of Part Two of ''[[Little Women]]''. ''[[Jo's Boys]]'' (1886) completed the "March Family Saga".

In ''[[Little Women]]'', Alcott based her heroine "Jo" on herself. But whereas Jo marries at the end of the story, Alcott remained single throughout her life. She explained her "[[spinsterhood]]" in an interview with [[Louise Chandler Moulton]], "I am more than half-persuaded that I am a man's soul put by some freak of nature into a woman's body. … because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man.”<ref>{{cite book |author1=Louise Chandler Moulton |authorlink1=Louise Chandler Moulton |title=Our Famous Women: An Authorized Record of the Lives and Deeds of Distinguished American Women of Our Times |date=1884 |publisher=A.

In addition to drawing on her own life during the development of ''Little Women,'' Alcott also took influence from several of her earlier works including "The Sisters' Trial," "A Modern Cinderella," and "In the Garret." The characters within these short stories and poems, in addition to Alcott's own family and personal relationships, inspired the general concepts and bases for many of the characters within ''Little Women'' as well as the author's subsequent novels. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Madeleine|first=Stern|title=Louisa May Alcott|publisher=[[Northeastern University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=978-1555534172|location=Boston|pages=168-182}}</ref>

''[[Little Women]]'' was well-received, with critics and audiences finding it suitable for many age groups. A reviewer of ''Eclectic Magazine'' called it "the very best of books to reach the hearts of the young of any age from six to sixty".<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Beverly Lyon |title=Louisa May Alcott: The Contemporary Reviews |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czzIm4FT-DkC&q=Louisa+May+Alcott:+The+Contemporary+Reviews+by+Beverly+Lyon+Clark|isbn=978-0521827805}}</ref> It was a fresh, natural representation of daily life. With the success of ''Little Women'', Alcott shied away from the attention and would sometimes act as a servant when fans would come to her house.

[[File:Grave of Louisa May Alcott.jpg|thumbnail|Louisa May Alcott's grave in [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord]], Massachusetts.]]
Along with [[Elizabeth Drew Stoddard|Elizabeth Stoddard]], [[Rebecca Harding Davis]], [[Anne Moncure Crane]], and others, Alcott was part of a group of female authors during the [[Gilded Age]], who addressed women's issues in a modern and candid manner. Their works were, as one newspaper columnist of the period commented, "among the decided 'signs of the times'".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Review 2 – No Title |journal=The Radical |date=May 1868}}</ref>
