===Dulwich College===
[[File:Dulwich College, College Road, Dulwich. - geograph.org.uk - 58443.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dulwich College]]]]
From 1975 to 1982 Farage was educated at [[Dulwich College]], a fee-paying [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] in south London. In his autobiography he pays tribute to the careers advice he received there from England [[Test cricket]]er [[John Dewes]], "who must have spotted that I was quite ballsy, probably good on a platform, unafraid of the limelight, a bit noisy and good at selling things".<ref>{{cite news |title=John Dewes obituary |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article4439440.ece |access-date=15 May 2015 |work=The Times |location=London |date=14 May 2015}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Farage was active in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] from his school days, having seen a visit to his school by [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Keith Joseph]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcmIHT6J0wc |title=Nigel Farage on Absolute Radio: Full Interview |date=17 April 2015 |access-date=28 April 2015 |website=YouTube |last=Absolute Radio |author-link=Absolute Radio |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019005421/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcmIHT6J0wc |archive-date=19 October 2015 }}</ref> In 1981, an English teacher who had not met the 17 year-old Farage, Chloe Deakin, wrote to the headmaster of Dulwich College, David Emms, asking him to reconsider his decision to appoint Farage as a prefect, citing concerns expressed by others over Farage's alleged 'fascist' views. Emms rejected those concerns, as did the College's deputy headmaster, Terry Walsh, who said later that Farage "was well-known for provoking people, especially left-wing English teachers who had no sense of humour." Farage later stated that some teachers were hostile to him because he was an admirer of Enoch Powell, and said: "Any accusation I was ever involved in far right politics is utterly untrue."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.channel4.com/news/nigel-farage-ukip-letter-school-concerns-racism-fascism |title=Nigel Farage schooldays letter reveals concerns over fascism |date=19 September 2013 |website=Channel 4 |publisher=Chennel 4 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802201628/https://www.channel4.com/news/nigel-farage-ukip-letter-school-concerns-racism-fascism |archive-date=2 August 2017 }}</ref>

==Early career==
After leaving school in 1982, Farage decided to seek employment in the City of London, trading commodities at the [[London Metal Exchange]].<ref name=goldsmith/> Initially, he joined the American commodity operation of [[broker]]age firm [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]],<ref name="ukwhoswho.com"/> transferring to [[Crédit Lyonnais|Crédit Lyonnais Rouse]] in 1986.<ref name="ukwhoswho.com"/> He joined [[Refco]] in 1994, and [[Natixis|Natixis Metals]] in 2003.<ref name="ukwhoswho.com"/>

Farage joined the Conservative Party in 1978, but voted for the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]] in [[1989 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1989]] because of what he saw as their then "sensible" and [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] policies.<ref name=":1" /> He left the Conservatives in 1992 in protest at Prime Minister [[John Major]]'s government's signing of the [[Treaty on European Union]] at [[Maastricht]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Profile: Nigel Farage |date=12 September 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5338364.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=24 February 2013 |archive-date=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130419151041/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5338364.stm |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Question Time: This week's panel |date=28 March 2007 |access-date=24 February 2013 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/6499699.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831205129/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/6499699.stm |archive-date=31 August 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Farage was ranked the fifth-most influential MEP by [[Politico]] in 2016, who described him as "one of the two most effective speakers in the chamber".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/list/the-40-meps-who-actually-matter-european-parliament-mep/nigel-farage/|title=NIGEL FARAGE|date=19 May 2016|access-date=26 June 2016|url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160605033433/http://www.politico.eu/list/the-40-meps-who-actually-matter-european-parliament-mep/nigel-farage/|archive-date=5 June 2016}}</ref> Reportedly, he would always be assigned office number 007 in the European Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.indy100.com/article/brexit-news-nigel-farage-james-bond-party-leave-eu-007-8985576 |title=Brexiteers tried to compare Nigel Farage to James Bond and the jokes wrote themselves|date=3 July 2019|website=indy100}}</ref>

====Jacques Barrot====
On 18 November 2004 Farage announced in the European Parliament that [[Jacques Barrot]], then French Commissioner-designate, had been barred from elected office in France for two years, after being convicted in 2000 of embezzling £2 million from government funds and diverting it into the coffers of his party. He said that French President [[Jacques Chirac]] had granted Barrot amnesty; initial BBC reports said that, under French law, it was perhaps illegal to mention that conviction.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/2/hi/europe/4032113.stm |title=Profile: Jacques Barrot |work=BBC News |date=22 November 2004 |access-date=8 June 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120529171852/http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/2/hi/europe/4032113.stm |archive-date=29 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The prohibition in question applies only to French officials in the course of their duties.<ref>The prohibition contained in the French penal code against mentioning crimes covered by an amnesty only concerns French officials who may hear of such crimes in the course of their duties (CP L133-11), and does not apply generally (L133-10).</ref> The President of the Parliament, [[Josep Borrell]], enjoined him to retract his comments under threat of "legal consequences".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPLkcgaWc0o |title=MEP Nigel Farage replies to Parliament President Josep Borrell |date=18 November 2004 |access-date=22 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910002624/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPLkcgaWc0o |archive-date=10 September 2013}}</ref> The following day, it was confirmed that Barrot had received an eight-month suspended jail sentence in the case, and that this had been quickly expunged by the amnesty decided by Chirac and his parliamentary majority.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/france.eu "Barrot survives call to quit"]. ''The Guardian'', 26 November 2004</ref>

====José Manuel Barroso====
In early 2005 Farage requested that the [[European Commission]] disclose where the individual Commissioners had spent their holidays. The Commission did not provide the information requested, on the basis that the Commissioners had a right of privacy. The German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' reported that the President of the European Commission, [[José Manuel Barroso]], had spent a week on the yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire [[Spiros Latsis]]. It emerged soon afterwards that this had occurred a month before the Commission under Barroso's predecessor [[Romano Prodi]] approved 10.3 million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis's shipping company.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article223215.ece |title=Barroso survives confidence debate over free holiday with Greek tycoon |location=London |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=26 May 2005 |access-date=8 June 2009 |first=Stephen |last=Castle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001091311/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article223215.ece |archive-date=1 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It also became known that [[Peter Mandelson]], then the British [[EU Commissioner]], had accepted a trip to Jamaica from an unrevealed source<ref>{{cite news |title=Commissioners Under Fire for Luxury Trips |url=https://www.dw.com/en/commissioners-under-fire-for-luxury-trips/a-1555478 |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=18 April 2005}}</ref> at a debate on 26 May 2005. The motion was heavily defeated. A Conservative MEP, [[Roger Helmer]], was expelled from his group, the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party – European Democrats]] (EPP-ED), in the middle of the debate by that group's leader [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]] as a result of his support for Farage's motion.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1490818/Euro-Tories-suspend-MEP-in-row-over-EU-president.html |title=Euro Tories suspend MEP in row over EU president |first=David |last=Rennie |date=26 May 2005 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |access-date=25 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Simon |last1=Hix |first2=Abdul G. |last2=Noury |first3=Gérard |last3=Roland |title=Democratic Politics in the European Parliament |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSDg5RV5_w4C&pg=PA136 |pages=135 |isbn=978-0521872881}}</ref>

Farage persuaded around 75 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from across the political divide to back a motion of no confidence in Barroso, which would be sufficient to compel Barroso to appear before the European Parliament to be questioned on the issue.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&sid=aFq2hOeCcYZc&refer=europe |date=25 May 2005 |title=Barroso Fights No-Confidence Vote Amid French Treaty Debate |last=Neuger |first=James G. |work=Bloomberg L.P. |location=New York |access-date=8 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&sid=aFq2hOeCcYZc&refer=europe |archive-date=16 November 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The motion was successfully tabled on 12 May 2005, and Barroso appeared before Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4578261.stm |title=Barroso rebuffs yacht questions |work=BBC News |date=25 May 2005 |access-date=8 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4578261.stm |archive-date=16 November 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2013 Farage criticised Barroso's former membership in the Maoist [[Portuguese Workers' Communist Party]], saying: "You are a man that likes fixed ideology, you probably picked it up when you were a communist or Maoist, or whatever you were, and for the last ten years you've pursued euro-federalism combined with an increasing green obsession."<ref>{{cite news |title=Barroso savages British Tories for 'looking like UKIP' |url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/barroso-savages-british-tories-for-looking-like-ukip/ |work=[[EURACTIV]] |date=12 September 2013}}</ref>

====Herman Van Rompuy====
After the speech of [[Herman Van Rompuy]] on 24 February 2010 to the European Parliament, Farage&nbsp;– to protests from other MEPs&nbsp;– addressed the former [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] and first long-term [[President of the European Council]], saying that he had the "charisma of a damp rag" and the appearance of "a low grade bank clerk".<ref name=bbc1>{{cite news |date=24 February 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8535121.stm |title=Tirade against 'damp rag' EU president shocks MEPs |work=BBC News |access-date=24 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225025721/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8535121.stm |archive-date=25 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> Farage questioned the legitimacy of Van Rompuy's appointment, asking, "Who are you? I'd never heard of you, nobody in Europe had ever heard of you." He also asserted that Van Rompuy's "intention [is] to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of the European nation states".<ref name=bbc1/><ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[YouTube]] |work=EUX.TV |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bypLwI5AQvY |title=Nigel Farage harangues EU President Herman van Rompuy |access-date=27 February 2010 |date=24 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309210826/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bypLwI5AQvY |archive-date=9 March 2010}}</ref> Van Rompuy commented afterwards, "There was one contribution that I can only hold in contempt, but I'm not going to comment further."<ref name=bbc1/> After refusing to apologise for behaviour that was, in the words of the President of the European Parliament, [[Jerzy Buzek]], "inappropriate, unparliamentary and insulting to the dignity of the House", Farage was reprimanded and had his right to ten days' allowance (expenses) "docked".<ref>{{cite news |title=MEP Nigel Farage fined over 'insulting' tirade |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8544904.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 March 2010 |access-date=21 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304045601/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8544904.stm |archive-date=4 March 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref name=Jerz>{{cite web|publisher=European Parliament |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eng-internet-publisher/eplive/expert/shotlist/20100303SHL92842 |title=EP President Jerzy BUZEK on MEP Nigel FARAGE – 68659 |date=3 March 2010 |access-date=21 March 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307164027/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eng-internet-publisher/eplive/expert/shotlist/20100303SHL92842 |archive-date=7 March 2010 }}</ref>

Buzek said after his meeting with Farage:

<blockquote>
I defend absolutely Mr Farage's right to disagree about the policy or institutions of the [[European Union|Union]], but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come... I myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility&nbsp;– in this case, to respect the dignity of others and of our institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage's behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore&nbsp;– as an expression of the seriousness of the matter&nbsp;– rescinded his right to ten days' daily allowance as a Member.<ref name=Jerz/>
</blockquote>

Questioned by [[Camilla Long]] of ''[[The Times]]'', Farage described his speech: "it wasn't abusive, it was right."<ref name=Long/>

====Prince Charles====
[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] was invited to speak to the European Parliament on 14 February 2008; in his speech he called for EU leadership in the battle against [[climate change]]. During the standing ovation that followed, Farage was the only MEP to remain seated, and he went on to describe the Prince's advisers as "naïve and foolish at best."<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news |title=UKIP anger at prince's EU speech |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7245183.stm |date=14 February 2008 |access-date=8 June 2009 |archive-date=17 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217205903/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7245183.stm |url-status=live}}</ref>

====Expenses disclosure====
In May 2009 ''[[The Observer]]'' reported a Foreign Press Association speech given by Farage in which he had said that over his ten years as a Member of the European Parliament he had received a total of £2 million of taxpayers' money in staff, travel, and other expenses.<ref name=Tob>{{cite news |work=The Observer |date=24 May 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/24/mps-expenses-ukip-nigel-farage |title=Ukip leader boasts of his £2m in expenses |access-date=8 June 2009 |first=Toby |last=Helm |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527061523/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/may/24/mps-expenses-ukip-nigel-farage |archive-date=27 May 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> In response, Farage said that in future all UKIP MEPs would provide monthly expense details.<ref name=Tob/>

====2014 European election====
In a second visit to Edinburgh in May 2014 Farage correctly predicted that UKIP would win a [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|Scottish seat]] in the European Parliament elections. Two hundred protesters heckled and booed him.<ref>{{cite news|date=9 May 2014 |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27339519 |title=European election: Farage sure UKIP will win Scotland seat |access-date=10 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621233213/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27339519 |archive-date=21 June 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Thirty police in two vans were needed to preserve order.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Gardham, Magnus |author2=Donnelly, Brian |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/police-keep-the-peace-as-ukip-leader-returns-to-edinburgh.24189260 |title=Police keep the peace as Ukip leader returns to Edinburgh |date=10 May 2014 |work=The Herald |location=Glasgow |access-date=10 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613021754/http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/police-keep-the-peace-as-ukip-leader-returns-to-edinburgh.24189260 |archive-date=13 June 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the European Parliament elections in 2014, Farage led UKIP to win the highest share of the vote.

====Undeclared gifts====
In June 2014 Farage declared £205,603 for gifts over 10 years, including free use of a barn for his constituency office, which had been declared in the EU register in [[Brussels]] each year. The Electoral Commission said that the gifts should have been also declared in the UK within 30 days of receipt and fined Farage £200.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27818780 |title=UKIP leader Nigel Farage declares £205,603 in gifts |author=Hawkins, Ross |work=BBC News |date=12 June 2014 |access-date=12 June 2014 |archive-date=13 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613021757/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27818780 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/electoral-commission-concludes-two-party-finance-cases | title = Electoral Commission concludes two party finance cases | date = 21 October 2014 | publisher = [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)]] | access-date = 3 July 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150628164218/https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/electoral-commission-concludes-two-party-finance-cases | archive-date = 28 June 2015}}</ref>

====Jean-Claude Juncker====
In early November 2014, just days after becoming head of the European Commission, the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] was hit by media disclosures—derived from a document leak known as [[Luxembourg Leaks]]—that Luxembourg under his premiership had turned into a major European centre of corporate [[tax avoidance]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Luxembourg tax files: how tiny state rubber-stamped tax avoidance on an industrial scale|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale|website=The Guardian|date=5 November 2014}}</ref> A subsequent [[motion of censure]] in the European Parliament was brought against Juncker over his role in the tax avoidance schemes.

===UKIP formation, leadership and resignations===
[[File:Nigel Farage of UKIP.jpg|thumb|Farage at the UKIP Conference in 2009]]
Farage was a founder member of [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] in 1993. On 12 September 2006 he was [[2006 UK Independence Party leadership election|elected leader of UKIP]] with 45 percent of the vote, 20 [[percentage point]]s ahead of his nearest rival.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.ukip.org/ukip_news/gen12.php?t=1&id=2526 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013075242/http://www.ukip.org/ukip_news/gen12.php?t=1&id=2526 |archive-date=13 October 2006 |url-status=dead |title=Nigel Farage is the new Leader of the UK Independence Party |publisher=UKIP |date=12 September 2006}}</ref> He pledged to bring discipline to the party and to maximise UKIP's representation in local, parliamentary and other elections. In a ''[[PM (Radio 4)|PM]]'' programme interview on BBC Radio 4 that day he pledged to end the public perception of UKIP as a single-issue party and to work with allied politicians in the [[Better Off Out]] campaign, committing himself not to stand against the MPs who have signed up to that campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6209386.stm |title=UKIP leader 'offered Tory seat' |first=Brian |last=Wheeler |work=BBC News |date=5 December 2006 |access-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206231332/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6209386.stm |archive-date=6 December 2006 }}</ref>

In his maiden speech to the UKIP conference, on 8 October 2006, Farage told delegates that the party was "at the centre-ground of British public opinion" and the "real voice of opposition". He said: "We've got three [[social democratic]] parties in Britain – Labour, Lib Dem and Conservative are virtually indistinguishable from each other on nearly all the main issues" and "you can't put a cigarette paper between them and that is why there are nine million people who don't vote now in general elections that did back in 1992."<ref>{{cite news|title=UKIP 'voice of British majority' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5415252.stm?ls |date=7 October 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919230637/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5415252.stm?ls |archive-date=19 September 2013 }}</ref>

At 10pm on 19 October 2006, Farage took part in a three-hour live interview and phone-in with [[James Whale (radio)|James Whale]] on the national radio station [[talkSPORT]]. Four days later, Whale announced on his show his intention to stand as UKIP's candidate in the [[2008 London mayoral election|2008 London Mayoral Election]]. Farage said that Whale "not only has guts, but an understanding of what real people think". Whale later decided not to stand and UKIP was represented by [[Gerard Batten]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukip.org/ukip_news/gen12.php?t=1&id=2687 |title=London Mayoral Elections |access-date=24 October 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><!--Why are you Bot medic?  -->

On 22 March 2015 Farage was targeted by anti-UKIP activists who chased him and his family from a [[pub lunch]] in [[Downe]], [[Greater London]]. His daughters ran away to hide and were later found to be safe.

However, on 11 May 2015, the party chairman said they would not accept Mr Farage's post-election resignation because the party's "election campaign had been a great success".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1481942/ukip-rejects-nigel-farages-resignation|title=UKIP Rejects Nigel Farage's Resignation|work=News.sky.com|access-date=14 May 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512164351/http://news.sky.com/story/1481942/ukip-rejects-nigel-farages-resignation|archive-date=12 May 2015}}</ref>

A row subsequently developed within the party, in which MEP and campaign chief [[Patrick O'Flynn]] described Farage's public image as "snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive" and said he risked turning the party into a "[[personality cult]]". O'Flynn accused Farage of paying too much attention to advisors that "would like to take UKIP in the direction of some hard-right, ultra-aggressive American Tea Party-type movement", singling out the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] and gun control liberalisation as particular issues. [[Raheem Kassam]], Farage's chief of staff and editor of [[Breitbart News#Breitbart London|Breitbart London]] was later sacked as a result, whilst O'Flynn stated that he continued to support Farage as party leader.<ref name="BBC News 14 May 2015">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32734220|title=UKIP adviser sacked in Nigel Farage row|date=14 May 2015|work=BBC News|access-date=14 May 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517064059/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32734220|archive-date=17 May 2015}}</ref> Farage also faced a number of calls from senior figures within the party to stand down.<ref name="The Guardian 14 May 2015">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/nigel-farage-facing-a-coup-over-ukip-leadership|title=Nigel Farage 'facing a coup' over Ukip leadership|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=14 May 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518093055/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/nigel-farage-facing-a-coup-over-ukip-leadership|archive-date=18 May 2015|access-date=14 May 2015}}</ref>

He insulted his fellow MEPs, stating that "virtually none" of them had ever had done "a proper job" in their lives.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stone |first=Jon |date=28 June 2016 |title=Nigel Farage Mocked and Heckled by MEPs During Extraordinary Speech |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-european-parliament-speech-heckled-brexit-eu-referendum-a7107131.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=28 June 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628114435/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-european-parliament-speech-heckled-brexit-eu-referendum-a7107131.html |archive-date=28 June 2016 }}</ref> Media around the world covered Farage's speech, including his comment: "... when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me.

Farage resigned as leader of the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] on 4 July 2016,<ref name="resignation 2016" /> saying that: "It's right that I should now stand aside as leader.

Following a legal challenge by [[Gina Miller]] to the use of the [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50#Legal proceedings against the government|Royal Prerogative to invoke article 50]], Farage appeared on ''The Andrew Marr Show'' with Miller.  She stated that "politicians had lied all the way through" and that the Referendum act clearly said that the result was advisory. Farage accepted that it was advisory, but said afterwards "I just want to ask her – what part of the word 'leave' don't you understand?".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-nigel-farage-forced-to-admit-the-eu-referendum-was-only-advisory-a7401151.html |title=Nigel Farage forced to admit that the EU referendum was only 'advisory' |first=Adam |last=Withnall |work=The Independent |location=London |date=6 November 2016 |access-date=8 November 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107142604/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-nigel-farage-forced-to-admit-the-eu-referendum-was-only-advisory-a7401151.html |archive-date=7 November 2016}}</ref> Farage talked of a peaceful protest and warned of unprecedented political anger if Parliament blocked Brexit. Miller said that parliamentary democracy required parliament to debate issues and that Farage had spent the whole Brexit campaign arguing for parliamentary sovereignty.

On 20 April 2017 Farage announced that he would not contest the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]].

===Brexit Party===
On 4 December 2018 Farage announced "with a heavy heart" on his live [[LBC]] radio show that effective immediately he had resigned his membership of UKIP, after 25 years as a member of the party. In explanation, Farage mentioned UKIP leader Gerard Batten's appointment the previous month of [[far-right]] [[Political Activist|activist]] [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] as an adviser and the National Executive of UKIP's voting in a [[no-confidence vote]] to keep Batten as leader of the party. Farage argued that Batten was "obsessed with the issue of [[Islam]], not just Islamic extremism, but Islam, and UKIP wasn't founded to be a party fighting a religious crusade." He also said that association with Robinson damaged the image of Brexit.<ref name=beeb299/>

On 8 February 2019 ''[[Reuters]]'' noted that the [[Brexit Party]] has been approved by the Electoral Commission and quoted Farage from an article he wrote in ''The Telegraph'', stating that he would stand as a candidate for The Brexit Party in any potential future European Parliament elections contested in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-farage-idUKKCN1PX1Y5|title=Farage ready to be new 'Brexit Party' candidate if EU exit delayed|date=8 February 2019|work=[[Reuters]]|author=Andy Bruce|access-date=8 February 2019 |quote=A filing by the Electoral Commission showed the Brexit Party had been approved this week to field candidates across England, Scotland and Wales.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/02/08/new-brexit-party-stands-ready-defend-democracy/?li_source=LI&li_medium=li-recommendation-widget|title=My new Brexit party stands ready to defend democracy|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|author=Nigel Farage|date=8 February 2019}}</ref> On 8 February 2019, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' quoted Farage as saying that the new party was a "live vehicle" that could be "mobilised" if Brexit is delayed.<ref name="ft">{{cite news |url= https://www.ft.com/content/d3197116-2bcf-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7 |title=New 'Brexit Party' backed by Nigel Farage launches |newspaper=Financial Times |location= London |date=8 February 2019 |first=Jim |last=Pickard |quote=A new political party backed by Nigel Farage has been launched in an attempt to attract hardline Conservative activists unhappy with Theresa May's attempt to forge a compromise Brexit plan.}}</ref>

On 14 May Conservative MP [[Crispin Blunt]] called for the government to go into an "electoral arrangement" with the Brexit Party to ensure Brexit was to happen on time. Asked by [[Huw Edwards]] if he would consider such a partnership, Farage said he would be willing to work with anyone to secure a deal that gets Britain out of the [[European Single Market|single market]], [[Customs Union between the EU and the UK|customs union]] and [[European Court of Justice]], but said that trust may be an issue, stating: "both main parties have let us down very badly".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-48275277/nigel-farage-i-d-do-a-deal-with-the-devil-for-brexit|title=Farage would 'do deal with devil' for Brexit|work=BBC News|access-date=23 May 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

====Arron Banks funding====
In May 2019 British broadcaster [[Channel 4 News]] reported it had seen invoices for travel and accommodation expenses between summer 2016 and summer 2017. It further reported that these benefits, worth "as much as £450,000", were funded by Arron Banks, and were not declared on Farage's register of interests, which he should have done as a serving [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]. [[Liberal Democrat (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MEP [[Catherine Bearder]], in her role as a quaestor (an MEP responsible for financial and administrative matters), raised the issue and this resulted in an official investigation opening on 21 May 2019. When asked by the BBC about the matter Farage replied, "Whatever happened after the referendum – I was leaving politics, it happened mostly in America, it had nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with the Brexit Party, it was purely on a personal basis. I was looking for a new career and a new life – it's got nothing to do with anything, it's a purely private matter."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-brexit-party-investigation-aaron-banks-eu-gifts-donations-funding-a8923961.html|title=Brexit Party: EU opens investigation into Nigel Farage's lavish gifts from millionaire tycoon|last=Stone|first=Jon|access-date=21 May 2019|date=21 May 2019|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-arron-banks-eu-authorities-investigation-gifts-tycoon-a8918946.html|title=Nigel Farage facing investigation by EU authorities over lavish gifts from millionaire tycoon|last=Stone|first=Jon|date=18 May 2019|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', he did not want the Brexit Party to face Conservative opposition in constituencies such as [[Wansbeck (UK Parliament constituency)|Wansbeck]] and [[West Bromwich East (UK Parliament constituency)|West Bromwich East]] and in return the Brexit Party would not contest seats where the leave vote was at risk of splitting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/brexit-party-farage-seeks-election-pact-with-conservatives|title=Brexit party: Farage seeks election pact with Conservatives|date=8 September 2019|website=The Guardian}}</ref> Farage said that his party and the Conservatives "together would be unstoppable".<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49665789|title=No 10 rejects Nigel Farage election pact proposal|date=11 September 2019|access-date=12 September 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

On 11 September, a senior Conservative source said that Farage was "not a fit and proper person" and "should never be allowed anywhere near government". The government confirmed that Boris Johnson would not form an electoral pact with Farage, to which he said he was "disappointed" as he was offering a "genuine hand of friendship".<ref name=":3" />

The Brexit Party gained 642,303 votes in the election but no seats. It was believed widely that they had helped the Conservative Party towards their majority of 80 by standing down in 317 Conservative-held seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/13/brexit-party-nigel-farage-boris-johnson-labour-leavers|title=The Brexit party folded, but make no mistake: Farage won it for Johnson|last=Loucaides|first=Darren|work=The Guardian|date=13 December 2019|access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref>

In May 2019 Trump congratulated Farage on his party winning 32 percent of UK votes in [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|that month's EU election]], and said he may meet him, as well as Boris Johnson, during his state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48462677 |title=Trump: Johnson and Farage are good guys |date=30 May 2019 |access-date=30 May 2019 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

===="Jewish lobby" remark====
In October 2017 Farage made controversial remarks during a discussion on LBC radio station after a caller who referred to himself as "Ahmed" told Farage he thought the [[Israel lobby in the United States|pro-Israeli lobby in the United States]] was equally dangerous to the [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in American politics]]. Farage responded by saying: "the [[Israel]]i lobby, you know, that’s a reasonable point, Ahmed, because there are about 6 million Jewish people living in America, so as a percentage it’s quite small, but in terms of influence it’s quite big...in terms of money and influence, yep, they are a very powerful lobby," and "there are other very powerful foreign [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbies in the United States of America]], and the Jewish lobby, with its links with the Israeli government, is one of those strong voices."<ref>{{cite news |title=UK's Farage says US Jews have disproportionate influence over politics |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/farage-says-us-jews-have-disproportionate-influence-over-politics/ |work=The Times of Israel |date=1 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="Goodkind">Nicole Goodkind, [http://www.newsweek.com/trump-russia-jewish-farage-brexit-698486 Jews Should Concern Americans More Than Russian Influence, Nigel Farage Says] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102083802/http://www.newsweek.com/trump-russia-jewish-farage-brexit-698486 |date=2 November 2017 }}, ''Newsweek'' (1 November 2017).</ref><ref name="JN">[http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/nigel-farage-urged-to-apologise-for-jewish-lobby-remark/ Nigel Farage urged to apologise for ‘Jewish lobby’ remark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101112524/http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/nigel-farage-urged-to-apologise-for-jewish-lobby-remark/ |date=1 November 2017 }}, ''[[Jewish News]]'' (31 October 2017).</ref> Farage's remarks were condemned by the [[Campaign Against Antisemitism]]<ref name="JN"/> and the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which said that Farage's comment "plays into deep-seated [[Antisemetic canard|anti-Semitic tropes]]" and was fuel for extremist conspiracy theories.<ref name="Goodkind"/>

==== 2020 presidential election ====
After gaining no seats in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 UK general election]] under the [[Brexit Party]] banner, Farage said he would leave the country to work as a warm-up speaker for [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Trump's 2020 campaign]] rallies.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/12/nigel-farage-brexit-party-results-live/ |title=Nigel Farage reveals he will campaign for Donald Trump next year as Brexit Party wins no seats |last1=Diver |first1=Tony |last2=White |first2=Josh |work=The Telegraph |location= London |date=13 December 2019 |access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref>

In June 2020, Farage was exempted by the US officials from the country's travel ban under a "national interest" clause, while Trump prepared for his first major election campaign rally since the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. On 20 June, he posted a picture from the US and was later spotted at the Trump rally, taking part in a "Team Trump on Tour" panel discussion.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-us-tulsa-donald-trump-coronavirus-travel-ban-a9577406.html |title=Nigel Farage exempt from US travel ban under 'national interest' clause ahead of Trump rally |access-date=20 June 2020 |newspaper=The Independent |location= London |date=20 June 2020 |first=Ashley |last=Cowburn}}</ref>

===Austria===
[[File:Nicolas Dupont Aignan et Nigel Farage.jpg|thumb|Farage with [[Nicolas Dupont-Aignan]] in 2013]]
During the [[2016 Austrian presidential election]] campaign, Farage said that [[Norbert Hofer]], the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] candidate, would call for a "Brexit style referendum" if he won. Hofer, however, ruled out a referendum and asked Farage not to interfere in Austria's internal politics.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/04/dont-interfere-austrias-far-right-presidential-candidate-tells/|title='Don't interfere,' Austria's far-right presidential candidate tells Nigel Farage|author=Roland Oliphant|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 December 2016|access-date=4 December 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204213951/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/04/dont-interfere-austrias-far-right-presidential-candidate-tells/|archive-date=4 December 2016}}

=== France ===
Farage initially endorsed Nicolas Dupont-Aignan of [[Debout la France]], another party of the [[Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe]], and later supported [[Marine Le Pen]] of the [[National Rally (France)|National Front]], for the second round of the [[2017 French presidential election]]. Farage said that the basis for his endorsement of Le Pen was his belief that she would be more sympathetic to the UK following Brexit, in contrast to the pro-European [[Emmanuel Macron]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Stone |first=Jon |date=4 May 2017 |title=Nigel Farage endorses far-right Marine Le Pen to be French president |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-backs-marine-le-pen-far-right-national-front-french-presidential-election-2017-a7716876.html |work=[[The Independent]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=12 October 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012201522/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-backs-marine-le-pen-far-right-national-front-french-presidential-election-2017-a7716876.html |archive-date=12 October 2017 }}</ref>

===Germany===
Farage spoke at a rally for the far-right [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) party in advance of the [[2017 German federal election]], having been personally invited by the party's deputy leader [[Beatrix von Storch]]. <ref>{{cite news |date=9 September 2017 |title=Nigel Farage given standing ovation at German far-right AfD election rally |url=https://news.sky.com/story/farage-says-germany-should-revolt-against-eu-as-he-joins-far-right-afd-election-rally-11026278 |work=Sky News |access-date=29 November 2020 }}</ref>

==Political views==

===Economy===
From taking office as a UKIP MEP in 1999, Farage has often voiced opposition to the "[[euro]] project". His argument is that "a one-size-fits-all interest rate" cannot work for countries with structurally different economies, often using the example of Greece and Germany to emphasise contrast.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22183867 |title=MEPs angry at EU's Olli Rehn over treatment of Cyprus |date=17 April 2013 |work=BBC News |access-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22183867 |archive-date=16 November 2006 }}</ref>

Farage strongly opposes the use of [[bailout]]s and says that "buying your own debt with taxpayers' money" will not solve the problem and that, "if we do, the next debt crisis won't be a country&nbsp;... it will be the [[European Central Bank]] itself".<ref name=youtube>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVJ-MdikNr0|title=Nigel Farage – Europe Trapped Inside an Economic Prison (A collage of speeches by UKIP Leader Nigel Farage) MEP in the European Parliament|date=22 April 2011|access-date=22 November 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910004237/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVJ-MdikNr0|archive-date=10 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=europarl>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/wps-europarl-internet/frd/vod/research-result-list?idmep=4525&language=en&pageby=unit&page=0&menusearchfrom=bymep&nameMep=FARAGE,%20Nigel |title=Europarl speech archives, with full list of all of Mr Farage's speeches in plenary that are referred to in original source video |publisher=European Parliament |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315234304/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/wps-europarl-internet/frd/vod/research-result-list?idmep=4525&language=en&pageby=unit&page=0&menusearchfrom=bymep&nameMep=FARAGE%2C%20Nigel |archive-date=15 March 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

On the issue of welfare, Farage wants migrants to live in the UK for five years before being able to claim benefits, and for them to be ineligible for tax credits.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage calls for five-year ban on migrant benefits|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25630036|access-date=19 October 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=7 January 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106101655/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25630036|archive-date=6 January 2016}}</ref> He believes that tax avoidance is caused by "punitive tax rates", and wants "fairer" taxes as a way to prevent it.<ref name="Walton 2015">{{cite news|last1=Walton|first1=Gregory|title=Nigel Farage speaks out about gay marriage and tax avoidance on Newsnight|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11410079/Nigel-Farage-speaks-out-about-gay-marriage-and-tax-avoidance-on-Newsnight.html|access-date=19 October 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 February 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825155448/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11410079/Nigel-Farage-speaks-out-about-gay-marriage-and-tax-avoidance-on-Newsnight.html|archive-date=25 August 2015}}</ref>

===Electoral reform===
During the campaigning before the [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|UK voting system referendum]] of May 2011, which offered the two options of a continuation of [[first-past-the-post]] and an [[alternative vote]] system, Farage declared himself in favour of the latter, saying that a continuation of first-past-the-post would be a "nightmare" for UKIP, although he also said that AV would make little difference to UKIP's fortunes. The party's stance was decided by its central policy-making committee,<ref name=WherePartiesStand>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11609887 |title=AV referendum: Where parties stand |work=BBC News |date=13 January 2011 |access-date=11 February 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116033105/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11609887 |archive-date=16 January 2011 }}</ref> although Farage expressed a preference for the [[AV+]] system as it "would retain the constituency link and then also the second ballot ensured there were no wasted votes".<ref name=BlackburnMay2011>{{cite news|last1=Blackburn|first1=David|title=Farage: AV is the thin of the wedge, that's why we support it|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2011/05/farage-av-is-the-thin-of-the-wedge-thats-why-we-support-it/|access-date=20 April 2016|work=Coffee House|publisher=The Spectator|date=4 May 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226175731/http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2011/05/farage-av-is-the-thin-of-the-wedge-thats-why-we-support-it/|archive-date=26 December 2016}}</ref> After the 2015 general election, in which UKIP took a much lower proportion of seats than votes, Farage called the [[first-past-the-post voting]] system (FPTP) "totally bankrupt".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hasan|first1=Medhi|author-link1=Medhi Hasan|title=Why does it take Nigel Farage to make the case for electoral reform?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/nigel-farage-electoral-reform-left-first-past-the-post-proportional-representation|access-date=19 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=2 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023211620/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/nigel-farage-electoral-reform-left-first-past-the-post-proportional-representation|archive-date=23 October 2015}}</ref> He had said in 2011: "I completely lost faith in [FPTP] [[2005 United Kingdom general election|in 2005]] when Blair was returned with a 60 seat majority on 36 per cent of the vote, or 22 per cent if you factor in low turnout."<ref name=BlackburnMay2011 />

===Environment===
In 2013 Farage criticised David Cameron's policy on wind turbines, describing it as covering "Britain in ugly disgusting ghastly windmills". An official energy policy document produced by UKIP while Farage was leader of the party stated that "UKIP strongly supports a clean environment and clean air, stressing that "coal-fired power stations must use clean technology to remove sulphur and nitrogen oxides, particulates and other pollutants".<ref>{{cite news|author=Ward, Bob |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=4 March 2013 |access-date=24 May 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/04/ukip-energy-climate-policies |title=Ukip's energy and climate policies under the spotlight |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430042350/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/04/ukip-energy-climate-policies |archive-date=30 April 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In a speech made to the European parliament on 11 September 2013, Farage cited news, that the Arctic Sea ice cap had apparently grown from 2012 to 2013, saying that this was evidence of decades "of Euro-federalism combined with an increasing Green obsession".<ref>{{cite news|author=Mathiesen, Karl |date=18 September 2013 |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=24 May 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/18/how-fast-is-arctic-sea-ice-melting |title=How fast is Arctic sea ice melting? |archive-date=25 May 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525202416/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/18/how-fast-is-arctic-sea-ice-melting  }}</ref> Farage has described climate change as a "scam".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/07/nigel-farage-denies-being-conspiracy-theorist-after-far-right-talkshow-appearances|title=Nigel Farage denies being conspiracy theorist after far-right talkshow appearances|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=7 May 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 May 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

===Healthcare===
Farage takes an anti-prohibitionist position on recreational drugs. In an April 2014 phone-in interview hosted by ''The Daily Telegraph'' he argued that the [[War on Drugs]] had been lost "many, many years ago", stating that "I hate drugs, I've never taken them myself, I hope I never do, but I just have a feeling that the criminalisation of all these drugs is actually not really helping British society." He argued in favour of a [[Royal Commission]] on drugs, which would explore all avenues as to how to legislate most effectively and deal with their related criminal and public health problems, including the possibility of their [[Drug liberalization|legalisation]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage: I've Never Done Drugs, But Legalise Them |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/04/04/nigel-farage-ukip-drugs-legalisation_n_5091437.html |access-date=25 May 2014 |newspaper=Huffington Post UK |date=4 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525195442/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/04/04/nigel-farage-ukip-drugs-legalisation_n_5091437.html |archive-date=25 May 2014 }}</ref>

In 2013 Farage said that the smoking ban in enclosed public spaces was "silly and illiberal"; he recommended separate smoking areas along the lines of some German states. He said that banning things makes them more attractive to children, and stated that "Obesity is killing more people than smoking, you could ban chip shops, you could ban doughnuts. The point is we are big enough and ugly enough to make our own decisions".<ref>{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage Says Smoking Ban 'Silly And Illiberal'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/30/nigel-farage-smoking-ban-germany-_n_3182909.html|access-date=19 October 2015|work=Huffington Post|date=30 April 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216061740/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/30/nigel-farage-smoking-ban-germany-_n_3182909.html|archive-date=16 December 2015}}</ref>

In his 2015 book Farage reflected that, based on his experiences, "the NHS is so over-stretched that if you can afford private health care, you should take it, particularly for diagnostics and preventative medicine. In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks. The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.<ref name=purplerev/>

Farage said in 2015 that money which the NHS could spend on treating taxpayers with serious conditions is instead spent on recent immigrants with [[HIV]].

===Foreign policy===
Farage has been highly critical of the wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan War|Afghanistan]], saying "Nobody should forget that the most devastating direct consequences of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been suffered by the likes of Mr Blair, but by the civilian populations of these countries and of course by our own brave service personnel".<ref name="Al Bawaba 2016">{{cite web | title=#Leave UKIP: Farage's top comments on the Middle East | website=Al Bawaba | date=4 July 2016 | url=http://www.albawaba.com/loop/leave-ukip-farage-top-comments-middle-east-859294 | access-date=4 July 2016 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705145627/http://www.albawaba.com/loop/leave-ukip-farage-top-comments-middle-east-859294 | archive-date=5 July 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Farage stated that migrant exodus from Libya had been caused by [[2011 military intervention in Libya|NATO military intervention]], approved by David Cameron and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], in the [[Libyan Crisis (2011–present)|civil war in Libya]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11548171/Nigel-Farage-David-Cameron-directly-caused-Libyan-migrant-crisis.html |title=Nigel Farage: David Cameron 'directly caused' Libyan migrant crisis |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 April 2015 |author=Holehouse, Matthew |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419184702/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11548171/Nigel-Farage-David-Cameron-directly-caused-Libyan-migrant-crisis.html |archive-date=19 April 2015 }}</ref> When the UK Parliament was debating direct military involvement in Syria in 2013, Farage cited the financial and human costs and poor outcomes of the UK involvements in Iraq and Afghanistan as reasons for Britain not to become involved militarily in Syria.

When asked on [[LBC]] in 2014, after [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013|same-sex marriage was legalised in England and Wales]], whether he supported gay marriage, he answered that he does "not support the idea of same-sex marriages, all the while we’re under the auspices of the [[European Court of Human Rights]]".<ref name="Holehouse 2014">{{cite web | last=Holehouse | first=Matthew | title=Nigel Farage on gay marriage: 'I think we are opening a very big can of worms here' | website=The Telegraph | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10728807/Nigel-Farage-on-gay-marriage-I-think-we-are-opening-a-very-big-can-of-worms-here.html | access-date=8 November 2020 | date=28 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="Wintour 2014">{{cite web | last=Wintour | first=Patrick | title=Gay marriage: Nigel Farage refuses to say 'I do' | website=the Guardian | date=28 March 2014 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/28/gay-marriage-nigel-farage-ukip | access-date=8 November 2020}}</ref> He added that he would not campaign to abolish same-sex marriage.<ref name="Holehouse 2014" /> He also believes that people who oppose same-sex marriage, such as Christian and Muslim communities, should be allowed to speak out about their beliefs.<ref name="Walton 2015" />

===Conspiracy theories===
In 2014, Farage appeared in an online documentary, ''Bilderberg: The Movie'', alongside a number of conspiracy theorists. In the film he said: "I've tried very hard not to believe in conspiracy theories," but accused the European Union of moving "towards [[supranationalism]]", adding: "I've got to know over the years the Van Rompuys, the Schulzes, you know, the Barrosos, even the Junckers, the Timmermans, and it's completely clear, they actually want to destroy the nation state as a unit". According to an investigation by the anti-racism group [[Hope Not Hate]], Farage has also retweeted [[Jack Posobiec]], a promoter of the debunked [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory]]. A Brexit party spokesman dismissed the findings as "a series of tangential, transient retweets."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Savage |first1=Michael |title=Brexit party MEPs' links to alt-right media agenda exposed |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/18/brexit-party-meps-links-alt-right-media-conspiracy-theories-revealed |work=The Observer |date=18 August 2019}}</ref> Farage has appeared alongside conspiracy theorists from the [[LaRouche movement]] and [[InfoWars]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview: The Ugly Truth About the Brexit Party |url=https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/overview/ |website=HOPE not hate}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Peter |title=How Farage adapted his voice to Infowars' toxic worldview |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/06/how-nigel-farage-adapted-his-message-infowars-toxic-worldview-alex-jones |access-date=4 September 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=6 May 2019}}</ref>

In 2019, Farage described financier [[George Soros]] as "the biggest danger to the entire western world" and alleged Soros seeks "to undermine democracy and to fundamentally change the makeup, demographically, of the whole European continent". As Soros is of [[Jews|Jewish]] descent, the Jewish [[Community Security Trust]] said "Nigel Farage should ensure that his language does not help [<nowiki/>[[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] conspiracy theories] to spread in British politics".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Peter |title=Farage criticised for using antisemitic themes to criticise Soros|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/12/farage-criticised-for-using-antisemitic-themes-to-criticise-soros |accessdate=29 November 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=12 May 2019}}</ref>

==Broadcasting career==

===Fox News===
In 2017, he began contributing to the American television network [[Fox News]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/315273-fox-news-signs-nigel-farage-backer-of-trump-and-brexit |title=Fox News signs Nigel Farage, backer of Trump and Brexit |last=Lejeune |first=Tristan |date=20 January 2017 |work=TheHill |access-date=21 June 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519083604/http://thehill.com/homenews/media/315273-fox-news-signs-nigel-farage-backer-of-trump-and-brexit |archive-date=19 May 2017}}</ref>

===LBC===
From January 2017 to June 2020 Farage hosted ''The Nigel Farage Show'' on the UK [[talk radio]] station LBC.<ref name=immediate/> The show was broadcast live on Monday to Thursday evenings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nigel-farage/|title=LBC|website=LBC|access-date=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618041612/http://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nigel-farage/|archive-date=18 June 2017}}</ref>

Farage said on his show that Channel 4 journalist [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]] "should be attacked" for his "condescending bias" during coverage of a pro-Brexit protest in March 2019. [[Ofcom]] decided that Farage had not broken their broadcasting code since he clarified that he meant a verbal attack.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49234351|title=Snow and Farage cleared over Brexit rally remarks|date=5 August 2019|access-date=5 August 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

On 31 October 2019, the day the UK was set to leave the European Union before the approval of a delay, Farage interviewed US President Donald Trump on his LBC show. Trump criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, saying it made it difficult for the UK to strike a trade deal with the US.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/10/31/donald-trump-interview-boris-johnson-urged-join-forces-nigel/|title=Donald Trump interview: Boris Johnson urged to join forces with Nigel Farage and beat 'bad' Jeremy Corbyn

<!--Farage Against The Machine-->
From March 2018 to July 2018, Farage hosted a podcast under the LBC banner entitled ''Farage Against The Machine'', a [[play on words]] for the term 'rage against the machine', where he discussed the latest political developments and political news with political figures who Farage both agrees, and disagrees with. New episodes of the podcast were released every Friday, but the podcast was cancelled after the American rock music band [[Rage Against the Machine]] sent a [[cease and desist]] letter to Farage, demanding that Farage change the name of the podcast, which he was unwilling to do, prompting LBC to reluctantly trigger its cancellation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/11/rage-against-the-machine-abhors-nigel-farage-podcast-tag|title=Rage Against the Machine demand Nigel Farage change podcast name|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref> {{Clear}}

On 11 June 2020, LBC announced that Farage would be leaving the station "with immediate effect", noting that his contract had been up for renewal.<ref name=immediate/>

<!--Health-->

He was in casts for 11 months but recovered, and the nurse who treated him became his first wife.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Farage|first1=Nigel|title=Nigel Farage: A car crash nearly killed me, but at least I got a wife out of it|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11466527/Nigel-Farage-A-car-crash-nearly-killed-me-but-at-least-I-got-a-wife-out-of-it.html|access-date=10 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416154302/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11466527/Nigel-Farage-A-car-crash-nearly-killed-me-but-at-least-I-got-a-wife-out-of-it.html|archive-date=16 April 2015}}</ref> On 26 December 1986, Farage first felt symptoms of what was later discovered to be [[testicular cancer]].
