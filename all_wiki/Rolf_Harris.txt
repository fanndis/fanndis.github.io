'''Rolf Harris''' (born 30 March 1930) is an Australian entertainer whose career has encompassed work as a musician, singer-songwriter, composer, comedian, actor, painter and television personality.<ref name="Stephenson">{{cite web|last=Stephenson |first=Alison|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/rolf-harris-presented-with-officer-of-the-order-of-australia-medal/story-e6frfmqi-1226512714861#ixzz2OCouDaz4 |title=Rolf Harris presented with Officer of the Order of Australia medal |publisher=News.com.au |date=8 November 2012|access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref>  He was convicted in 2014 of the [[sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] of four underage girls, which effectively ended his career.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/30/rolf-harris-trial-entertainer-career|title=Rolf Harris trial shattered image of avuncular entertainer|work=The Guardian|date=30 June 2014|access-date=10 July 2015}}</ref>

Harris is known for his songs "[[Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport]]" (a Top 10 hit in Australia, the UK, and the United States) and "[[Jake the Peg]]" and his recording of "[[Two Little Boys]]" (which reached number 1 in the UK).

In July 2014, at the age of 84, Harris was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison on twelve counts of [[indecent assault]] on four female victims during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Career in television, music, and art==
===1950s===
Harris moved to England in 1952<ref name="BBC q"/> and became an art student at [[City and Guilds of London Art School]] in South London, at the age of 22. In 1953 he found work in television, at the [[BBC]], performing a regular ten-minute cartoon drawing section in a one-hour children's show called ''Jigsaw'', with a puppet called "Fuzz", made and operated on the show by magician [[Robert Harbin]]. He went on to illustrate Harbin's ''Paper Magic'' programme in 1956. In 1954, Harris was a regular on a [[BBC Television]] programme ''Whirligig'', which featured a character called "Willoughby", who sprang to life on a drawing board, but was erased at the end of each episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whirligig-tv.co.uk/tv/children/whirligig/whirligig.htm |title=Whirligig nostalgia web-site |publisher=Whirligig-tv.co.uk |access-date=17 January 2011}}</ref>

By this stage, Harris had drifted away from art school as a slightly disillusioned student. He then met his longtime hero, Australian impressionist painter Hayward Veal (1913–1968), who became his mentor, teaching him the rudiments of impressionism and showing him how it could help with his portrait painting.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5087294.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Rolf Harris: People's painter |work=BBC News |date=16 June 2006 |access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref> At the time that he was working with Veal, Harris was also entertaining with his piano accordion every Thursday night at a club called the Down Under, frequented by Australians and New Zealanders. At the Down Under venue Harris honed his entertainment skills over several years, eventually writing what later became his theme song, "[[Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport]]".<ref>[http://www.markdapin.com.au/features/rolfharris.html Rolf Harris: Portrait of an artist as an older man] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717072258/http://www.markdapin.com.au/features/rolfharris.html |date=17 July 2014 }}, Mark Dapin, 21 July 2006. Retrieved 27 June 2014.</ref>

Although Harris chiefly appeared on the BBC, he was also on the British [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and when commercial television started in 1955, he was the only entertainer to work with both the BBC and [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]. He performed on the BBC with his own creation, Willoughby, a specially made board on which he drew Willoughby (voiced and operated by [[Peter Hawkins]]). The character would then come to life to engage in a comedic dialogue with Harris as he drew cartoons of Willoughby's antics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/8594443.stm |title=Valued exposure: Willoughby |work=BBC News |access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref> On [[Associated Rediffusion]]'s ''Small Time'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rolfharrisentertainer.com/television.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409195222/http://www.rolfharrisentertainer.com/television.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= 9 April 2011 |title=Rolf Harris web-site |publisher=Rolfharrisentertainer.com |access-date=25 May 2012}}</ref> Harris invented a character called Oliver Polip the Octopus, which he drew on the back of his hand and animated. Harris then illustrated the character's adventures with cartoons on huge sheets of card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tntdownunder.com/entertainment/celebrities/interview-rolf-harris-still-going-strong|title=Interview: Rolf Harris – Can you tell what it is yet?|work=TNT Down Under|date=26 May 2012|access-date=19 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522071547/http://www.tntdownunder.com/entertainment/celebrities/interview-rolf-harris-still-going-strong|archive-date=22 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 1 March 1958, in London, Harris married Alwen Hughes, a Welsh sculptor and jeweller, while they were both art students. At their wedding, they had a dog as bridesmaid.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/rolf-harris/ Rolf Harris], BBC Welsh Arts.

Harris returned to [[Perth]] in Australia when television was introduced there in 1959 after he was [[Executive search|headhunted]]. He subsequently produced and starred in five episodes of a half-hour weekly children's show, as well as his own weekly evening variety show.<ref name="BBCprofile">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-22216075|title=Rolf Harris: Profile|work=BBC News|access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref> From 1959, he worked on [[TVW-7]]'s first locally produced show, ''Spotlight'', and during this time he recorded "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" on a single microphone placed above him in the television studio.

The song was sent to [[EMI]] in [[Sydney]], Australia, and was released shortly afterwards as a record, becoming both his first recording and his first number one single. The song was successful in the UK. Harris offered four local backing musicians 10% of the royalties from the song, but they decided to take a recording fee of £7 each, because they did not think the song would be successful.<ref>Did you know&nbsp;... page 18 "''Westside News''", 20 February 2008&nbsp;– Brisbane, Queensland, Australia</ref> The novelty song was originally titled "Kangalypso"<ref>{{cite web|title=Where Did They Get That Song?|url=http://www.poparchives.com.au/1164/rolf-harris/kangalypso|website=Pop Archives|access-date=7 June 2014|year=2014}}</ref> and featured the distinctive sound of the "[[wobble board]]".

The fourth verse – "[[Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport#Deleted verse|Let me abos go loose, Lou/Let me abos go loose/They're of no further use, Lou/So let me abos go loose]]" – became increasingly controversial, because of the use of what later became regarded as a [[List of ethnic slurs|racial slur]], and was removed in later versions of the song. In 2006, four decades after the song's release, Harris expressed his regret about the original lyric.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/rolf-sorry-he-let-racist-lyrics-loose/2006/12/05/1165080950179.html|title=Rolf's lyrics 'a sign of the times'|author=Renee Switzer|work=[[The Age]]|date=6 December 2006|access-date=3 December 2007}}</ref>

===1960s to 1980s===
At the end of 1960, he toured Australia sponsored by [[Dulux]] paints and singing his hit song whilst doing huge paintings on stage with Dulux emulsion paint. While painting on stage, one of his catchphrases was, "Can you tell what it is yet?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rolfharrisentertainer.com/faq.htm#5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828083116/http://www.rolfharrisentertainer.com/faq.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 August 2010 |title=Rolf Harris profile |publisher=Rolfharrisentertainer.com |date=30 March 1930 |access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref> After Harris and his wife returned to England, they visited Perth to meet family and for tours of Australia, where he spent as much as four months travelling with his band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1438410.htm|title=ENOUGH ROPE with Andrew Denton – episode 90: Rolf Harris|date=15 August 2005|publisher=Abc.net.au|access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref> In 1964, he and his wife had a daughter, Bindi (born 10 March 1964), named for the town of [[Bindi Bindi, Western Australia|Bindi Bindi]].<ref>{{IMDb name|0365271}}; retrieved 27 June 2014.</ref>

After returning to the UK in 1962, he was introduced to [[George Martin]], who re-recorded all of his songs the following year, including a remake of "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" which became a huge hit in the US, and "[[Sun Arise]]", an Aboriginal-inspired song Harris had written with Perth naturalist [[Harry Butler]]. The song reached number two in the UK charts, ceding the number one spot to [[Elvis Presley]]. Harris met and worked with [[the Beatles]] after they started recording with Martin, and he [[wikt:compère|compèred]] their 16-night season of Christmas shows at London's [[Rainbow Theatre|Finsbury Park Astoria Theatre]] (now the [[Rainbow Theatre]]) in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/1963/12/24/the-beatles-christmas-show|title=24 December 1963: The Beatles' Christmas Show begins|publisher=The Beatles Bible|date=24 December 1963|access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref> Harris sang "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport", with the Beatles singing backing vocals, for the first edition of the ''From Us to You'' BBC radio show in December 1963.

Harris created one of his best known characters in the 1960s, [[Jake the Peg]], but his biggest success in terms of record sales was in 1969, with his rendering of the American Civil War song "[[Two Little Boys]]", originally written in 1902. Harris later discovered a personal poignancy to the song, as the story bears such a resemblance to the World War I experiences of his father Crom, and Crom's beloved younger brother Carl who died at the age of 19 after being wounded in battle in France two weeks before the Armistice of November 1918.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4969451.ece|first=Richard|last=Brooks|title=Rolf Harris unearths own family's tale of 'two little boys' in Somme cemetery|work=The Sunday Times |date=19 October 2008|access-date=4 February 2010}}</ref> "Two Little Boys" was the [[List of Christmas number one singles (UK)|Christmas Number One song]] in the UK charts for six weeks in 1969.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, his BBC TV programmes remained a  light-entertainment staple, with the last show, ''Rolf on Saturday OK?'', broadcast on Saturday evenings.<ref name="BBCprofile"/>  On many of his television appearances, Harris painted pictures on large boards in an apparently slapdash manner, with the odd nonsense song thrown in, asking "Can you tell what is it yet?" as he painted. Only at the end of the song would a fully formed picture emerge, sometimes only after the board was turned through 90 or 180 degrees. Such appearances led to several television series based on his artistic ability, such as ''[[Rolf's Cartoon Time]]'', broadcast on [[BBC One]] from 1979 to 1989, and ''[[Rolf's Cartoon Club]]'', on ITV between 1989 and 1993.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolf Harris profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-22216075|website=BBC News: Entertainment & Arts|publisher=BBC|access-date=7 June 2014|date=9 May 2014}}</ref>

===Later career===
In the late 1980s, Harris was touring in Australia and was asked to sing his own version of Led Zeppelin's "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" for the television programme ''[[The Money or the Gun]]'' performing with his own small group; a version was released as a single in the UK several years later. This cover version reached number seven in the charts, which led to his appearance at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 1993. Harris appeared at six subsequent Glastonbury festivals—1998, 2000, 2002, 2009, 2010 and 2013—and a wobble board Harris used to perform "Stairway to Heaven" on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' is an exhibit at the [[National Museum of Australia]]. In 2000, Harris, along with Steve Lima, released a dance track called "Fine Day", which entered the "top 30" in the UK charts at that time. A "[[Kilmarnock F.C.|Killie-themed]]" version of the song was scheduled for release in March 2007, to coincide with the Scottish football club Kilmarnock's appearance in the [[Scottish League Cup]] final after the song was adopted by the club's fans in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fineday.co.uk|title=Fine Day|access-date=17 January 2011}}</ref> One of the adapted lyrics referred to a hypothetical situation, in which Kilmarnock could be losing the match 5–0, and the club coincidentally lost 5–1. Harris performed "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" in 2000 with the Australian children's group [[the Wiggles]], he was subsequently digitally removed from DVD releases after his conviction.<ref>{{cite web|title= Rolf Harris stripped of his ARIA Hall of Fame induction|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/rolf-harris-stripped-of-his-aria-hall-of-fame-induction-20140701-zss4t.html/|work=Syndney Morning Herald|last=Cooper|first=Mex|date=1 June 2014|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>

===Charges===
In August 2013, Harris was again arrested by Operation Yewtree officers and charged with nine counts of indecent assault dating to the 1980s, involving two girls between fourteen and sixteen years, and four counts alleging production of indecent child images in 2012.<ref name="guardian29"/><ref name="BBCAug13">{{cite news|title=Rolf Harris faces new allegations|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23581847|access-date=5 August 2013|work=BBC News Online|date=5 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23880768|title=Assault charges for Rolf Harris|publisher=BBC|date=29 August 2013|access-date=30 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0829/470994-rolf-harris-charged-with-13-sex-offences|title=Rolf Harris Charged With 13 Sex Offences|publisher=Rte.ie|date=19 February 2013|access-date=30 August 2013}}</ref> The [[Crown Prosecution Service]]'s [[Alison Saunders]] explained to the media:

Harris appeared at [[Westminster Magistrates' Court]] on 23 September 2013, charged with nine counts of indecent assault and four counts of making indecent images of children. His lawyer indicated that Harris would plead not guilty and he was subsequently [[bail]]ed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rolf Harris to stand trial over assault charges in April|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24428587|access-date=7 October 2013|work=BBC News|date=7 October 2013}}</ref> In December 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Harris was facing three further counts of sexual assault.

The four counts of making indecent images were related to the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]], which interprets viewing images on a computer as making images. The charges were brought after detectives examined Harris's computer and found 33 images of possibly underage models amongst thousands of adult pornographic images. Harris never entered a plea on the charges, as his lawyers argued successfully that the charges should be severed from the twelve sexual assault charges and tried separately. In the aftermath of Harris's conviction, it was reported that his legal team had obtained the identity documents of the models involved, confirming they were adults over eighteen.<ref name=Julian2014>{{Cite news| last = Drape| first = Julian| title = Harris won't be tried over 'teen' porn| work = GoldCoastBulletin| access-date = 7 July 2014| url = http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/breaking-news/harris-wont-be-tried-over-teen-porn/story-fnjbnxok-1226978539484}}</ref> The websites Harris had visited, according to the [[Internet Watch Foundation]], are not known for illegal images of children.

Six charges related to when she was between the ages of 13 and 15, and one when she was 19. Harris denied that he had entered into a sexual relationship with the girl until she was 18. During the trial, a letter Harris had written to the girl's father in 1997 after the end of the relationship was shown in court, saying: "I fondly imagined that everything that had taken place had progressed from a feeling of love and friendship—there was no rape, no physical forcing, brutality or beating that took place."<ref name="charges">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27907511|title=Rolf Harris: The charges against him|work=BBC News|date=30 June 2014|access-date=6 July 2014}}</ref>
