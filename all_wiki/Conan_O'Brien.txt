'''Conan Christopher O'Brien''' (born April 18, 1963) is an American television host, comedian, writer, podcaster, and producer. He is best known for hosting the [[late-night talk shows]] ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', and since 2010, ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' on the cable channel [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]. Prior to his hosting career, he was a writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

Born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Massachusetts]], O'Brien was raised in an [[Irish Catholic]] family. He served as president of ''[[The Harvard Lampoon]]'' while attending [[Harvard University]], and was a writer for the sketch comedy series ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]''. After writing for several comedy shows in Los Angeles, he joined the writing staff of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. O'Brien was a writer and producer for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' for two seasons until he was commissioned by [[NBC]] to take over [[David Letterman]]'s position as host of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' in 1993. A virtual unknown to the public, O'Brien's initial ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'' tenure received unfavorable reviews and remained on a multiweek renewal cycle during its early years. The show generally improved over time and was highly regarded by the time of his departure in 2009. Afterwards, O'Brien relocated from New York to Los Angeles to host his own incarnation of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' for seven months until network politics prompted a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|host change]] in 2010.

Known for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized as "awkward, self-deprecating humor", O'Brien's late-night programs combine the "lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films (remotes)".<ref name="NewYorkT">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24Conan-t.html?pagewanted=all|title= Heeeere's . . .

[[File:Conan O'Brien - Simpsons (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|O'Brien in the offices of the writers of ''The Simpsons'', 1992]]

After graduating from Harvard, O'Brien moved to [[Los Angeles]] to join the writing staff of [[Home Box Office|HBO]]'s ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]''.<ref name="avclub">{{cite news|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=https://www.avclub.com/content/node/52144|title=Conan O'Brien|newspaper=[[The A.V.

In January 1988, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (SNL) executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]], hired O'Brien as a writer. During his three years on ''SNL'', he wrote such recurring sketches as "Mr.&nbsp;Short-Term memory" and "The Girl Watchers"; the latter was first performed by [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Jon Lovitz]].<ref name="speakerbio">{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.greatertalent.com/speakers/speakers.php?speakerid=235|title=Host of Late Night With Conan O'Brien|publisher=Greater Talent Network |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418032637/http://www.greatertalent.com/speakers/speakers.php?speakerid=235 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = April 18, 2008}}</ref>

While on a writers' strike from ''Saturday Night Live'' following the 1987–88 season, O'Brien put on an [[improvisational comedy]] revue in Chicago with fellow ''SNL'' writers [[Bob Odenkirk]] and Robert Smigel called ''[[Happy Happy Good Show]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Laugh Lines The Bits and Pieces That Get Comics into the Act|work=Chicago Tribune|date=June 24, 1988|author=Boulware, Hugh}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Live, From Chicago, It's...|work=Chicago Tribune|date=July 29, 1988|author=Bommer, Lawrence}}</ref> While living in Chicago, O'Brien briefly roomed with [[Jeff Garlin]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Jeff Garlin interview|series=[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]|airdate=September 7, 2007}}</ref> In 1989, O'Brien and his fellow ''SNL'' writers received an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy or Variety Series.

O'Brien, like many ''SNL'' writers, occasionally appeared as an extra in sketches; his most notable appearance was as a doorman in a sketch in which [[Tom Hanks]] was inducted into the SNL "[[Five-Timers Club]]" for hosting his fifth episode. O'Brien returned to host the show in 2001 during its 26th season. O'Brien and [[Robert Smigel]] wrote the television pilot for ''[[Lookwell]]'' starring [[Adam West]], which aired on NBC in 1991. The pilot never went to series, but it became a [[cult hit]]. It was later screened at ''The Other Network'', a festival of unaired TV pilots produced by [[Un-Cabaret]]; it featured an extended interview with O'Brien and was rerun in 2002 on the [[Trio (TV network)|Trio]] network.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

In 1991, O'Brien's engagement to be married was called off and ''Lookwell'' was not picked up. Burned out, he quit ''Saturday Night Live''.<ref name="nymag2" /> "I told Lorne Michaels I couldn't come back to work and I just needed to do something else," O'Brien recalled. "I had no plan whatsoever. I was literally in this big transition phase in my life where I decided, I'll just walk around New York City, and an idea will come to me."<ref name="ortved1">{{cite book|last=Ortved|first=John|title=[[The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History]] |year=2009|publisher=Greystone Books|isbn=978-1-55365-503-9|pages=160–161|ref=Ortved}}</ref>

Literally, in my first ten minutes at ''The Simpsons'', a bird had flown through the glass of my window, hit the far wall, broken its neck, and fallen dead on the floor. [[George Meyer]] came in and looked at it, and said, "Man, this is some kind of weird omen."|source=— O'Brien on his first moments at ''The Simpsons''<ref name="ortved1" />}}

[[Mike Reiss]] and [[Al Jean]], then [[showrunner]]s of the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'', called O'Brien and offered him a job. The series was prodigious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls "everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired."<ref name="ortved1" /> O'Brien was one of the first hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend, actor [[Lisa Kudrow]], O'Brien purchased an apartment in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name="nymag2" /><ref name="ortved3">Ortved, 2009. p. 163</ref> He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing.

From 1991 to 1993, O'Brien was a writer and producer for ''The Simpsons''. When O'Brien first arrived at the Fox lot, they temporarily gave him writer [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]]'s office. O'Brien was nervous and self-conscious, feeling that he would embarrass himself in front of what he regarded as an intimidating collection of writers.<ref name="ortved1" /> O'Brien would pitch characters in their voices, as he thought that was the norm, until Reiss informed him that no one did this.<ref name="ortved2">Ortved, 2009. p. 162</ref><ref name="O'Brien">O'Brien, Conan.

O'Brien wrote some of the series' most acclaimed episodes: "[[Marge vs. the Monorail]]" and "[[Homer Goes to College]]".<ref name="ortved1" /><ref name="EWsimp">[https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748~3~0~25bestand1,00.html The Family Dynamic] ''Entertainment Weekly''.

[[Wallace Wolodarsky]] described a "room character" Conan put on for the writers: "Conan used to do this thing called the Nervous Writer that involved him opening a can of [[Diet Coke]] and then nervously pitching a joke. He would spray Diet Coke all over himself, and that was always a source of endless amusement among us."<ref name="ortved2" /> During his time at ''The Simpsons'', O'Brien also had a side project working with Smigel on the script for a musical film based on the "[[Hans and Franz]]" sketch from ''Saturday Night Live'', but the film was never produced.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302839,00.html|title=Muscle-Man Bound|last=Pearlman|first=Cindy|date=July 8, 1994|work=People|accessdate=December 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>Interview with Kevin Nealon.

Meanwhile, [[David Letterman]] was preparing to leave the talk show ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'', prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels to search for a new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent [[Gavin Polone]] stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce.<ref name="ortved4" /> He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. [[Jason Alexander]] and [[Mimi Rogers]] were the guests, and the audience was composed of ''Simpsons'' writers.<ref name="ortved5">Ortved, 2009. p. 165</ref> Wolodarksky recalled the experience: "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn't ever imagine actually happening."<ref name="ortved5" /> The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched.<ref name="NewYorkT" />

O'Brien was picked as the new host of ''Late Night'' on April 26, 1993.<ref name="NewYorkT" /> As the writers headed to the voice record for "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien received a phone call from Polone informing him of the decision. "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. "I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'"<ref name="ortved6">Ortved, 2009. p. 166-167</ref> Fox, however, would not let O'Brien out of his contract.

=== ''Late Night'' (1993–2009) ===
{{Main|Late Night with Conan O'Brien}}
''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', originating from Studio 6A at [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] in New York City, premiered on September 13, 1993 to unfavorable reviews from contemporary critics.

Things would improve slowly.{{Opinion|date=January 2020}} Banter between O'Brien and Richter improved, and sketches grew in popularity ("If They Mated", "Desk Drive", "In the Year 2000").<ref name="shales2" /> A reliable staple involved a TV screen, lowered behind O'Brien's desk and displaying a still photo of a news figure.

O'Brien hosted ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' for over seven months in 2009 and 2010.

During the taping of the Friday, September 25, 2009, episode of ''The Tonight Show'', O'Brien suffered from a mild concussion after he slipped and hit his head while running a race as part of a comedy sketch with guest [[Teri Hatcher]].

By January 2010, O'Brien's ratings for ''The Tonight Show'' were much lower than they had been when the show was hosted by Jay Leno. On January 7, 2010, NBC executive Jeff Zucker met with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien to discuss how to move Leno out of prime time, where his ratings were lackluster, and back into late night. It was proposed that O'Brien would remain as host of ''The Tonight Show'', which would run at 12:05&nbsp;am with Leno hosting a 30-minute show at 11:35&nbsp;pm.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/business/media/08leno.html?ref=business|title=NBC Wants Leno Back in Old Slot|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 8, 2010 | first=Bill | last=Carter | date=January 8, 2010}}</ref> Three days later, [[NBC Universal]] Television Entertainment chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' would be moved to 11:35&nbsp;pm following NBC's coverage of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2010/01/10/nbc-leno-return.html |title=Leno returns to late night: NBC |date=January 10, 2010 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112015459/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2010/01/10/nbc-leno-return.html |archivedate=January 12, 2010 }}</ref>

=== Stalker ===
Starting in September 2006, O'Brien was [[Stalking|stalked]] by Father David Ajemian of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Archdiocese of Boston]], who, despite multiple warnings to stop, sent O'Brien letters signed as "your priest stalker" and came into contact with O'Brien's parents. O'Brien and Ajemian had attended [[Harvard University]] at the same time. Frustrated that he had been denied a spot in the ''Late Night'' audience, Ajemian sent a letter to O'Brien stating that he flew to New York "in the dimming hope that you might finally acknowledge me." He stated in another letter, "Is this the way you treat your most dangerous fans??? You owe me big time, pal." In another letter, Ajemian seemed to make a death threat, saying, "Remember [[Frank Costello]] once dodged a bullet in your building and so can you."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/08/arts/08conan.html|title=Priest Jailed in Stalking of Conan O'Brien|last=Lambert|first=Bruce|date=November 8, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 27, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Ajemian then tried to forcefully enter a taping of ''Late Night'' but was caught and arrested. He had previously been warned by the NBC security team to stay away from the studio. After a psychological evaluation, he was deemed fit to stand trial. He was bailed out of jail.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://news.aol.com/entertainment/television/tv-news-story/ar/_a/conans-alleged-priest-stalker-in-court/20071108070609990001|title = Conan's Alleged 'Priest Stalker' in Court}}</ref> He was then reported missing by his father on November 10, 2007. He was found and underwent evaluation at a hospital. He was again found fit to stand trial on April 4, 2008. On April 8, Ajemian pleaded guilty to stalking, stating that he "never meant to cause anxiety or to upset anyone." He was ordered to pay a $95 court charge and to sign a two-year [[restraining order]] barring him from coming near O'Brien.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/conan-obrien-stalker-pleads-guilty/n20080408181909990014|title = Conan Stalker Pleads Guilty}}</ref> Ajemian was later [[Loss of clerical state (Catholic Church)|laicized]].<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/12/david-ajemian-conans-prie_n_125918.html|title = Conan O'Brien's Stalker Checks Out of Treatment|work = HuffPost|date = September 12, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080915032034/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/12/david-ajemian-conans-prie_n_125918.html|archivedate = September 15, 2008|df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/11/19/priest-in-conan-obrien-stalker-case-arrested-again/|title=Priest in Conan O'Brien stalker case arrested again|date=November 19, 2010|work=New York Post|access-date=September 27, 2017}}</ref>
