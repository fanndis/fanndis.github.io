'''''Acacia pycnantha''''', most commonly known as the '''golden wattle''', is a tree of the family [[Fabaceae]] native to southeastern Australia. It grows to a height of {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} and has [[phyllode]]s (flattened leaf stalks) instead of true leaves. [[Sickle]]-shaped, these are between {{convert|9|and|15|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|1-3.5|cm|in|sigfig=1|frac=4|abbr=on}} wide. The profuse fragrant, golden flowers appear in late winter and spring, followed by long seed pods. Plants are cross-pollinated by several species of [[honeyeater]] and [[Acanthiza|thornbill]], which visit [[Nectar#Extrafloral nectaries|nectaries]] on the phyllodes and brush against flowers, transferring pollen between them. An [[understorey]] plant in [[eucalyptus]] forest, it is found from southern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, through Victoria and into southeastern South Australia.

Explorer [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] collected the [[type specimen]], from which [[George Bentham]] wrote the [[species description]] in 1842. No subspecies are recognised. The bark of ''A. pycnantha'' produces more [[tannin]] than any other wattle species, resulting in its commercial cultivation for production of this compound. It has been widely grown as an ornamental garden plant and for cut flower production, but has become a weed in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, as well as Western Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales.  ''Acacia pycnantha'' was made the official [[List of Australian floral emblems|floral emblem of Australia]] in 1988, and has been featured on the country's postal stamps.

Floral buds are produced year-round on the tips of new growth, but only those initiated between November and May go on to flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August.<ref name="buttrose">{{cite journal|last=Buttrose|first=M.S.|author2=Grant, W.J.R. |author3=Sedgley, M. |journal=Australian Journal of Botany |date=1981|title=Floral Development in ''Acacia pycnantha'' Benth.

[[Johann Georg Christian Lehmann]] described ''Acacia petiolaris'' in 1851 from a plant grown at Hamburg Botanic Gardens from seed said to be from the [[Swan River Colony]] (Perth). {{sfn|Kodela|2001|p=297}} [[Carl Meissner]] described ''A. falcinella'' from material from Port Lincoln in 1855. Bentham classified both as ''A. pycnantha'' in his 1864 ''[[Flora Australiensis]]'', though he did categorise a possible subspecies ''angustifolia'' based on material from [[Spencer Gulf]] with narrower phyllodes and fewer inflorescences.<ref name="Bentham 1864">{{cite encyclopedia | last= Bentham| first= George | year = 1864 | title = ''Acacia pycnantha'' | encyclopedia = [[Wikisource:Flora Australiensis|Flora Australiensis]] | volume = Volume 2: Leguminosae to Combretaceae | page = 365 | location = London, United Kingdom | publisher = L.

In 1921 [[Joseph Maiden]] described ''Acacia westonii'' from the northern and western slopes of Mount Jerrabomberra near [[Queanbeyan]] in  [[New South Wales]]. He felt it was similar to, but distinct from, ''A. pycnantha'' and was uncertain whether it warranted species rank. His colleague [[Richard Hind Cambage]] grew seedlings and reported they had much longer [[Plant stem|internodes]] than those of ''A. pycnantha'', and that the phyllodes appeared to have three [[Nectar#Extrafloral nectaries|nectaries]] rather than the single one of the latter species.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maiden|first=Joseph Henry|date=1921|title=Notes on Two Acacias|journal=Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales|volume=54|pages=227–30|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/41869385}}</ref> It is now regarded as a synonym of ''A. pycnantha''.<ref name=apni/>

Common names recorded include golden wattle, green wattle, black wattle, and broad-leaved wattle.<ref name=apni/> At [[Ebenezer Mission]] in the [[Wergaia]] country of north-western Victoria the aborigines referred to it as ''witch''.<ref name="Maiden1890">{{cite book|author=Maiden, Joseph Henry|title=Wattles and wattlebarks of New South Wales|publisher=Charles Potter|location=Sydney, New South Wales |url=http://adc.library.usyd.edu.au/data-2/p00111.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Clark1995">{{cite book|author= Clark, Ian|title=Scars in the Landscape: Hidden Aboriginal History in Western Victoria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0dIhJqRqYgC&pg=PA177|date= 1995|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press|isbn=978-0-85575-595-9|page=177}}</ref>

Hybrids of the species are known in nature and cultivation. In the [[Greater Bendigo National Park|Whipstick forest]] near [[Bendigo]] in Victoria, putative hybrids with Whirrakee wattle (''[[Acacia williamsonii]]'') have been identified; these resemble hakea wattle (''[[Acacia hakeoides]]'').{{sfn|Kodela|2001|p=298}} Garden hybrids with Queensland silver wattle (''[[Acacia podalyriifolia]]'') raised in Europe have been given the names ''Acacia x siebertiana'' and ''Acacia x deneufvillei''.<ref name=apni/>

==Cultivation==
Golden wattle is cultivated in Australia and was introduced to the northern hemisphere in the mid-1800s. Although it has a relatively short lifespan of 15 to 30 years, it is widely grown for its bright yellow, fragrant flowers.<ref name=boden/><ref name="MaslinMcDonald2004"/> As well as being an ornamental plant, it has been used as a windbreak or in controlling erosion. Trees are sometimes planted with the taller sugar gum (''[[Eucalyptus cladocalyx]]'') to make a two-layered windbreak.<ref name="FAO"/> One form widely cultivated was originally collected on [[Mount Arapiles]] in western Victoria. It is [[floriferous]], with fragrant flowers appearing from April to July.{{sfn|Elliot|Jones|1985|p=103}} The species has a degree of frost tolerance and is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, but it prefers good drainage.{{sfn|Elliot|Jones|1985|p=103}} It tolerates heavy soils in dry climates,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lothian|first=T.R.N.|date=1969|title=Gardening in the Low Rainfall Regions|journal=Australian Plants|volume=5|issue=38|pages=54–55, 80–95 [89]}}</ref> as well as mild [[soil salinity]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zwar |first=J.|date=1975 |title=Trees in Dry Areas |journal=Australian Plants|volume=8|issue=64 |pages=164–67 [165]}}</ref> It can suffer yellowing ([[chlorosis]]) in limestone-based (alkaline) soils.<ref name="FAO"/> Highly drought-tolerant, it needs {{convert|370-550|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} winter rainfall for cultivation.<ref name="FAO"/> It is vulnerable to gall attack in cultivation.<ref name="holliday">{{cite book|last=Holliday|first=Ivan|title=A Field Guide to Australian Trees|publisher=Hamlyn|date=1989|edition=2nd|page=28|isbn=978-0-947334-08-6|location=Port Melbourne, Victoria}}</ref> Propagation is from seed which has been pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard seed coating.<ref name=boden/>

==Symbolic and cultural references==
[[File:golden-wattle.jpg|thumb|Golden wattle in full flower|alt=Green leaves and numerous small yellow round flowerheads against the sky]]
Although wattles, and in particular the golden wattle, have been the informal floral emblem of Australia for many years (for instance, it represented Australia on the [[Coronation gown of Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953), it was not until Australia's bicentenary in 1988 that the golden wattle was formally adopted as the [[List of Australian floral emblems|floral emblem of Australia]]. This was proclaimed by Governor-General Sir [[Ninian Stephen]] in the [[Government gazette]] published on 1 September.<ref name=gaz>{{cite web | author=Stephen, Ninian| year=1988| title=Proclamation of ''Acacia pycnantha'' as the Floral Emblem of Australia | work=Australian National Botanic Gardens | url=http://anbg.gov.au/emblems/ac.pyc.gaz.html | accessdate=11 September 2014 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070905035902/http://anbg.gov.au/emblems/ac.pyc.gaz.html | archivedate=5 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The day was marked by a ceremony at the [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] which included the planting of a golden wattle by [[Hazel Hawke]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister's]] wife. In 1992, 1 September was formally declared "[[Wattle Day|National Wattle Day]]".<ref name=boden/>

The [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]] includes a wreath of wattle; this does not, however, accurately represent a golden wattle. Similarly, the [[green and gold]] colours used by Australian international sporting teams were inspired by the colours of wattles in general, rather than the golden wattle specifically.<ref name=boden/>

The species was depicted on a stamp captioned "wattle" as part of a 1959–60 [[Postage stamps and postal history of Australia|Australian stamp]] set featuring Australian native flowers. In 1970, a 5c stamp labelled "Golden Wattle" was issued to complement an earlier set depicting the floral emblems of Australia. To mark [[Australia Day]] in 1990, a 41c stamp labelled "Acacia pycnantha" was issued.<ref name=boden/> Another stamp labelled "Golden Wattle", with a value of 70c, was issued in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plant:''Acacia pycnantha''|work=Australian Plants on Stamps|publisher=Australian National |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/stamps/stamp-acacia-pycnantha-2014.html|accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>

[[Clare Waight Keller]] included golden wattles to represent Australia in [[Meghan Markle|Meghan Markle's]] [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle|wedding]] veil, which included the distinctive flora of each [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/wedding-dress-bridesmaids%E2%80%99-dresses-and-page-boys-uniforms|title=The Wedding Dress: Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy|date=19 May 2018|publisher=The Royal Household, UK}}</ref>

The 1970 [[Monty Python|Monty Python's Flying Circus]] [[Bruces sketch]] includes a reference, by one of the stereotyped Australian characters, to "the wattle" as being "the emblem of our land", with suggested methods of display including "stick[ing] it in a bottle or hold[ing] it in your hand" - despite the wattle prop itself being a large, forked branch with sparse patches of leaves and generic yellow flowers.
