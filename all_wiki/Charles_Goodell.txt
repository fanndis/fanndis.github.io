'''Charles Ellsworth Goodell Jr.''' (March 16, 1926{{spaced ndash}}January 21, 1987) was an American [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] and a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]]. In both cases he came into office following the deaths of his predecessors, first in a special election and second as a temporary appointee.

He was elected to four terms in Congress after winning his first race in 1960. He resigned on September 9, 1968, to accept an appointment by Governor [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] to fill the vacancy caused by the [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassination of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy]] on June 5, 1968. Having earned the support of both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal]] parties in 1970, he lost in a three-way race to [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] candidate [[James L. Buckley]], having split the liberal vote with [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate [[Richard Ottinger]].

Goodell was the father of [[National Football League]] Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]].

==Early life and education==
Goodell was born in [[Jamestown, New York]], the son of Francesca (née Bartlett) and Charles Ellsworth Goodell. He attended the [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] of Jamestown and graduated from [[Williams College]] as a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1948. He served in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[World War II]] era as a [[seaman apprentice|seaman second class]] (1944–46) and in the [[United States Air Force]] as a [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] (1952–53) during the [[Korean War]].

Goodell received an [[LL.B.]] from [[Yale Law School]] in 1951 and an [[M.A.]] in government from Yale in 1952. He briefly taught at [[Quinnipiac College]] in 1952. Following his admission to the [[Connecticut]] [[bar (law)|bar]] (1951) and the New York bar (1954), he began his law practice in Jamestown. He was a great-grandson of William Goodell, an abolitionist.

==Congressional career==
Goodell was a congressional liaison assistant for the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in 1954–1955. He won a [[special election]] on May 26, 1959, as a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] to the [[86th United States Congress]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[Daniel A. Reed]]. In NY District 43, Goodell polled 27,454 votes (65 percent) to the Democrat Robert E. McCaffery's 14,250 ballots (33.8 percent).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Goodell was re-elected in November 1960 to the [[87th United States Congress|87th Congress]], and re-elected three times thereafter. During his tenure in the House, Goodell voted in favor of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|Civil Rights Acts of 1960]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/86-1960/h102|title=HR 8601.

RES. 29. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BAN THE USE OF POLL TAX AS A REQUIREMENT FOR VOTING IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS.|work=GovTrack.us}}</ref> He resigned on September 9, 1968, to accept Governor [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]]'s appointment to the [[United States Senate]], filling the vacancy caused by the [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassination of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy]] on June 5, 1968. Because a special election to fill the vacancy would not be held for over two years, public objection to the length of Goodell's appointment led to a failed legal challenge to the Governor's power to appoint Senators in the event of a vacancy, ''Valenti v. Rockefeller''.

Although he had been a moderate to [[conservative]] member in the House, as a Senator he was nearly as [[Liberalism|liberal]] as New York's other Republican Senator, [[Jacob K. Javits]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lynn |first=Frank |date=January 22, 1987 |title=Charles E. Goodell, Former Senator, is Dead at 60 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/22/obituaries/charles-e-goodell-former-senator-is-dead-at-60.html |work=New York Times |location=New York, NY}}</ref> In the [[United States Senate|Senate]], Goodell authored and sponsored a large number of bills, including several to provide conservation and development aid to small towns and rural areas. Many small upstate New York communities without municipal sewage systems built them with the aid of federal matching funds provided by Goodell's legislation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} He "joined the quasi-[[pacifist]] [[Oregon]] senator [[Mark Hatfield]] as the loudest anti-[[Vietnam War]] voices in the Republican Party."<ref>[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]] (February 23, 2009) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2009/feb/23/00035/ Guns or Bitter], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Anti-war protesters and activists praised his advocacy of a withdrawal from Vietnam.<ref>http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10787</ref>

In 1970, the New York Republican Party was split deeply over the issue of the [[New Right#Second New Right|Second New Right]] [[conservatism]] of much of the [[grassroots]] support for the party versus the perceived [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] of the party organization, leadership, and Governor Rockefeller himself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} While Rockefeller's supporters were strong enough within the party and its regular organization to assure Goodell's receiving the party's nomination for what would be his first full term, conservative activists left the party ''en masse'' to support someone farther to the right. Additionally, then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-President]] [[Spiro T. Agnew]], alluding to Goodell's shift from moderate-conservative Republican to liberal Republican, went so far as to call him the "[[Christine Jorgensen]] of the Republican Party," analogizing his ideological shift to Jorgensen's highly publicized [[gender reassignment]]. Goodell was not discouraged. Running under the [[slogan]] "Senator Goodell — He's too good to lose", he received the nomination of the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] as well as that of the regular Republican organization, an [[electoral fusion]] allowed under New York law.

One television ad aired by Goodell's campaign just before election day in 1970 contrasted his record with his two opponents. A voice over the graphics said "New York voters face real choices in this year's Senate election: Congressman [[Richard Ottinger]], the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate, who has sponsored two pieces of legislation in six years in the House. Republican Senator Charles Goodell, who has sponsored forty-four major pieces of legislation in twenty-two months in the Senate. Conservative nominee [[James L. Buckley]], who has an economic plan for the nineteenth century. Those are your choices on election day: the light weight; the heavy weight; and the dead weight."

In [[New York state election, 1970|the November 1970 election]], despite Rockefeller's support and that of the Republican and Liberal parties, Goodell split the liberal vote with Ottinger, and was defeated by  [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] candidate Buckley. Goodell finished third, with 24.3 percent of the vote.

Goodell would be the last appointed U.S. Senator from New York until 2009, when [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] was selected to replace [[Hillary Clinton]], who had been appointed [[Secretary of State]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]].

==Life after leaving Congress==
After leaving Congress, Goodell resumed the practice of law. In the mid-1970s, Goodell served as Vice-Chairman, with former Pennsylvania Governor [[William Scranton]] as Chairman, of President [[Gerald Ford]]'s committee to draft rules for granting amnesty to [[Vietnam War]]-era draft evaders and deserters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2003/09/this-day-at-law-president-ford-offered.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509134536/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2003/09/this-day-at-law-president-ford-offered.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2009 }}</ref>

Goodell was a resident of [[Washington, DC|Washington, D.C.]] and [[Bronxville, New York]], until his death on January 21, 1987.<ref>https://buffalonews.com/sports/bills/the-other-goodell-how-nfl-commissioners-dad-ran-afoul-of-nixon/article_eb389794-1c5b-5cfe-8500-28e0d7ac9ec9.html</ref> He was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Jamestown.
