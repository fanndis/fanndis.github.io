'''Lin''' ({{IPAc-cmn|l|in|2}}; {{zh|c={{linktext|林}}|p=Lín}}) is the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] romanization of the [[Chinese surname]] written 林. It is also used in [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]] among the [[Chinese Filipino]] community. It is also common among [[overseas Chinese]] families, in which it is at times pronounced and spelled as '''Lim''' because many Chinese descendants are part of the [[Southern Min]] diaspora and speak [[Min Nan]]. In [[Cantonese]]-speaking regions such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] it is spelled as '''Lam'''.

==Name origin==
[[King Zhou of Shang]] (reigned 1154 to 1122 BC), the last king of the [[Shang dynasty]], had three uncles advising him and his administration. The king's uncles were [[Bi Gan]], [[Jizi]], and Weizi. Together the three men were known as "The Three Kind-Hearted Men of Shang" in the kingdom.<ref>http://forest.awardspace.com/lintree.html?topic=lintree1st</ref> Bi Gan was the son of Prince Ding, son of King Shang and, thus, was King Zhou's uncle.

Zhou was a cruel king, but his three uncles could not persuade him to change his ways. Failing in their duty to advise the king, Weizi resigned. Jizi faked insanity and was relieved of his post. Only Bi Gan stayed on to continue advising the king to change his ways. "Servants who are afraid of being killed and refrain from telling the truth are not righteous" he said. This put him in danger of incurring the king's wrath. Bi Gan stayed at the palace for three days and nights to try to persuade the blood-thirsty and immoral king to mend his ways.<ref>http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200609/06/eng20060906_300239.html</ref>

The stubborn king would not relent and had Bi Gan arrested for treason. Upon hearing this, his pregnant wife escaped into the forest and went into labor there. With no one to help her, she gave birth to a boy in the rocky cave in the forest, in a placed called Chang Lin (長林).<ref name="Oxford dict">The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland</ref>

Before long, King Zhou was overthrown by [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]]. King Wu knew about the courageous court advisor Bi Gan and sought his wife and child. When he found them, he honoured them in respect of Bi Gan. The mother and child were restored to the royal family. The new king conferred the surname Lin (meaning forest) on Bi Gan's son.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

==Different versions of the name==
*This family name is common among the [[Malaysian Chinese]] community. However, because the vast majority of Chinese Malaysians romanized their surnames according to the pronunciations of their respective southern Chinese dialects, it is very rarely romanized as "Lin". The [[Hakka]], [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew people|Teochew]] and [[Hainan]] communities romanize it as "Lim" whereas the [[Cantonese]]-speaking community uses "Lam" or "Lum".
*The Korean surname [[Im (Korean name)|Im]] ({{linktext|임}} in South Korean spelling; {{linktext|림}} in North Korean spelling; commonly romanized as Lim or Rim) is the Korean pronunciation of the same Chinese character (林). A much less common Korean surname Im is derived from another character ({{linktext|任}}; spelled {{linktext|임}} ''Im'' in both North and South Korean) the character used to write the surname [[Ren (surname)|Ren]]. In Korean, the former is called ''Supul Rim'' (수풀 림) and the latter ''Matgil Im'' (맡길 임) when they need to be distinguished.
*A common Japanese surname, [[Hayashi]], is written with the same character 林 and also means ''forest''. A much rarer Japanese surname, Rin, is also written with same character.
*The Vietnamese surname, "Lâm", was formerly written using the same character.
*In [[Singapore]], although "Lim" and "Lam" are generally more common variants, the extremely rare spelling "Lyn" can be found in select families of Chinese, Japanese, or other [[East Asians|East Asian]] ancestry (also transcribed using the 林 character) and bears no known relation to the English or Scottish surname of the same spelling, or alternate spelling "Ling".
*A rare Chinese surname which is also transcribed ''Lin'' is [[wikt:藺|藺]] / [[wikt:蔺|蔺]] (pinyin Lìn), a notable historical person being the [[Warring States period]] statesman [[Lin Xiangru]] .
*Indonesians of Chinese ancestry bearing this surname sometimes spell it as "Liem", pronounced from Fuqing dialect.
*Guamanians and [[Filipino-Chinese|Filipinos of Chinese descent]] with this surname mostly use the Hokkien spelling "Lim", as the majority have Fujianese ancestry. It is sometimes found in [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Hispanicised]] compound surnames such as "Limjoco" in the Philippines, and "Limtiaco" in Guam; this type of surname is often derived from the full and complete original name of a Spanish-era immigrant patriarch.
*Prominent [[Thai Chinese]] royalist families with this surname are bestowed by member of the royal family some indigenised derivative such as "Limthongkul" "Sirilim" "Limpisthira." 
*The character "霖" (Lín, "heavy rain showers") is also a popular personal name among ethnic Chinese people.

==Notable people surnamed Lin==
This is an East Asian name, meaning the surname is stated "before" the given name, though East Asian persons living in Western countries will often put their surname after their given name.
