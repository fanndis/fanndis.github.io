'''DreamWorks Pictures'''  (also known as '''DreamWorks SKG''' or '''DreamWorks Studios''', commonly referred to as '''DreamWorks''') is an American [[Production company|film production]] company, and a label of [[Amblin Partners]]. It was founded in 1994 as an original live-action [[film studio]] by [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and [[David Geffen]] (together, '''SKG'''), of which they owned 72%. The studio formerly distributed its own and third-party films. It has produced or distributed more than ten films with box-office grosses of more than $100&nbsp;million each.

In December 2005, the founders agreed to sell the studio to [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]], parent of [[Paramount Pictures]]. The sale was completed in February 2006 (this version is now named DW Studios). In 2008, DreamWorks announced its intention to end its partnership with Paramount and made a deal to produce films with India's [[Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group]],<ref name="GT-DEX-2008-CN-M-X"/> re-creating DreamWorks Pictures as an independent entity. The following year, DreamWorks entered into a distribution agreement with [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], wherein Disney would distribute DreamWorks films through [[Touchstone Pictures]]; the deal continued until 2016. As of October 2016, DreamWorks' films are marketed and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. Currently, DreamWorks operates out of offices at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].

DreamWorks is distinct from its [[DreamWorks Animation|former animation division of the same name]], which was spun off in 2004 and later became a subsidiary of [[NBCUniversal]] in 2016.<ref name="lat-closed">{{cite web|title=Comcast's NBCUniversal completes purchase of DreamWorks Animation|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-comcast-dreamworks-deal-complete-20160822-snap-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref> Spielberg's company continues to use the original DreamWorks trademarks under license from DreamWorks Animation.<ref name=sec>[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1297401/000095015709000533/ex99-1.htm ex99-1].

== History ==
=== DreamWorks SKG: original founding ===
The original company was founded following [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]]'s resignation from the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]] in 1994. Katzenberg approached [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[David Geffen]] about forming a live-action and animation film studio, which had not been done in decades due to the risk and expense. They agreed on three conditions: They would make fewer than nine movies a year, they would be free to work for other studios if they chose, and they would go home in time for dinner. They officially founded DreamWorks SKG in October 1994, with financial backing of $33 million from each of the three partners<ref>{{cite news |last1=Svetkey |first1=Benjamin |title=Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, and Steven Spielberg Start a Studio |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/10/28/jeffrey-katzenberg-david-geffen-and-steven-spielberg-start-studio/ |accessdate=14 August 2018 |work=EW.com |date=28 October 1994 |language=en}}</ref> plus $500 million from [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]], and $300 million from [[CJ Group|Cheil Jedang Group]] heiress {{Interlanguage link|Miky Lee|ko|이미경 (1958년)}}.

Despite access to [[sound stage]]s and [[Theatrical scenery|sets]], DreamWorks preferred to film motion pictures [[Filming location|on location]]. Usually, the company would film in a soundstage or set in a [[major studio]]. DreamWorks, now a label under Amblin Partners, is still based on the Universal lot.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In December 1994, [[DreamWorks Television]] was formed after DreamWorks agreed to a $200 million seven-year television production joint venture with the [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities/ABC]].<ref>McClellan, Steve.

In 1995, [[traditional animation]] artists from [[Amblimation]] joined the new studio, which led to DreamWorks buying part of [[Pacific Data Images]], a company specializing in visual effects, and renaming PDI/DreamWorks. Both were software divisions and would merge later on. For then, DreamWorks had the traditional animators working for their animation department, and the computer animators worked on CG films. Amblimation would be shut down in 1997, leading the staff to join [[DreamWorks Animation]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The same year, DreamWorks Interactive, a computer and video game developer and [[joint venture]] between DreamWorks and Microsoft, was founded. On February 24, 2000, [[Electronic Arts]] announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive and merged it with [[EA Pacific]] and [[Westwood Studios]] to form [[EA Los Angeles]], later [[Danger Close Games]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In June 1995, DreamWorks announced that it had signed a $1 billion deal with [[MCA Inc.]] (then parent company of Universal Pictures) to distribute its theatrical releases in other countries and its home video releases worldwide over 10 years.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fabrikant |first1=Geraldine |title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; MCA to Distribute Dreamworks' Films Abroad |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/14/business/the-media-business-mca-to-distribute-dreamworks-films-abroad.html |accessdate=9 December 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=14 June 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Horn |first1=John |title=MCA Makes Huge Deal With DreamWorks Studio |url=https://apnews.com/36fd5e14999b47d5486131ec3ee0ba02 |accessdate=9 December 2019 |work=AP NEWS |date=13 June 1995}}</ref> MCA also bought a 2% stake in the company for $54 million.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bates |first1=James |last2=Eller |first2=Claudia |title=DreamWorks, MCA Ally on Distribution : Entertainment: Each firm will split profits for the film- music deal worth $1 billion over 10 years, Seagram says. |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-06-14-fi-13102-story.html |accessdate=9 December 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=14 June 1995}}</ref>

In 1996, the company's record label, [[DreamWorks Records]], was founded, the first project of which was [[George Michael]]'s album ''[[Older (album)|Older]]''. The first band signed to the label was [[Eels (band)|eels]], who released their debut album ''[[Beautiful Freak]]'' (1997). The record company never lived up to expectations, though, and was sold in October 2003 to [[Universal Music Group]], which operated the label as [[DreamWorks Nashville]]. That label was shut down in 2005 when its flagship artist, [[Toby Keith]], departed to form his own label.<ref>Stark, Phyllis, "Toby Keith topped country charts, shook up Music Row," ''[[Billboard magazine]]'', December 24, 2005, p. YE-18.</ref>

In 1997, DreamWorks Pictures released its first three feature films, ''[[The Peacemaker (1997 film)|The Peacemaker]]'', a film about terrorism; ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Spielberg's first film for the studio about an African slave rebellion and the aftermath of the massacre; and ''[[Mouse Hunt]]'', the studio's first family film about two brothers trying to fight a mischievous mouse.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1998, the [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals|United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld a lawsuit against DreamWorks for trademark infringement by Dreamwerks Production Group, Inc.,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1455238.html |title=DREAMWERKS PRODUCTION GROUP INC v.

DreamWorks Pictures continued to distribute PDI/DreamWorks productions through their distribution name until 2004.

In 2000, DreamWorks was planning in building a studio [[backlot]] after buying 1,087 acres of land in the [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles|Playa Vista]] area in Los Angeles. It was to be complete with 18 [[sound stage]]s, with many office buildings and a lake. There would also be new homes, schools, churches, and museums. The project was to be completed in 2001, but was cancelled for financial reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seeing-stars.com/Studios/Dreamworks.shtml|title=Dreamworks|work=seeing-stars.com}}</ref> Starting in 1999, DreamWorks won three consecutive [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] for ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' and ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' (the latter two were co-productions with Universal Pictures). The same year, [[Go Fish Pictures]], a division of DreamWorks with the objective to distribute [[art film|art-house]], [[independent film|independent]] and [[world cinema|foreign]] films, was founded. The division experienced success with the [[anime]] films ''[[Millennium Actress]]'' (2003) and ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'' (2004), respectively, which led them to venture into releasing live-action films, with the release of ''[[The Chumscrubber]]''. However, ''The Chumscrubber'' was a commercial and critical failure, which led DreamWorks to shut down the division in 2007 shortly after the release of the Japanese film ''[[Casshern (film)|Casshern]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

For the period beginning October 1, 2004 to January 31, 2006, DreamWorks films were distributed in the domestic theatrical and worldwide television market by DreamWorks Pictures and in international theatrical and worldwide home entertainment markets by Universal Pictures.<ref>{{cite web|title=DREAMWORKS ANIMATION SKG, INC. - FORM 10-K (Annual Report) |url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/DWA/0x0xS1193125-11-45757/1297401/filing.pdf |publisher=DreamWorks Animation SKG |website=Shareholder.com|page=148|date=February 25, 2011|format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529091102/http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/DWA/0x0xS1193125-11-45757/1297401/filing.pdf |archivedate=May 29, 2012}}</ref> In 2004, DreamWorks Animation was spun off into a separate public company.

David Geffen admitted that DreamWorks came close to bankruptcy twice. Under Katzenberg's watch, the studio suffered a $125 million loss on ''[[Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas]]'',<ref name=island /> and also overestimated the DVD demand for ''[[Shrek 2]]''.<ref>[https://money.cnn.com/2005/07/01/technology/dvds/index.htm DVD: doom, gloom or boom?], CNN</ref> In 2005, out of their two large budget pictures, ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' was produced as a joint effort with [[Paramount Pictures]] which was the first to reap a significant amount of profits, while ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' bombed at the domestic box office but turned a profit internationally through [[Warner Bros.]].<ref name=island>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164329,00.html|title='Island' Could Sink DreamWorks Sale|author=Roger Friedman|work=Fox News}}</ref>

=== Paramount ownership ===
In December 2005, the [[Viacom (1952–2006)|original Viacom]], the then-parent of Paramount Pictures, agreed to purchase the live-action studio, still keeping the original name and producing/distribution name. The deal was valued at approximately $1.6 billion, an amount that included about $400 million in debt assumptions.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Peter Pae|author2=Claudia Eller|title=DreamWorks and Paramount settle divorce|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-oct-06-fi-dream6-story.html|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 6, 2008}}</ref> The acquisition of the live-action DreamWorks studio was completed by the [[Viacom (2005–2019)|second iteration of Viacom]], which had recently split from the original at the end of 2005, on February 1, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2005/12/11/news/fortune500/viacom_dreamworks.reut/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215154440/http://money.cnn.com/2005/12/11/news/fortune500/viacom_dreamworks.reut/index.htm|title=Paramount's DreamWorks come true|archivedate=December 15, 2005|work=cnn.com}}</ref>

On March 17, 2006, Viacom agreed to sell a controlling interest in the DreamWorks Pictures live-action library to [[Soros Fund Management|Soros Strategic Partners]] and [[Dune Entertainment]] II.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/18/business/media/18film.html|title=Viacom to Sell DreamWorks Film Library|date=March 18, 2006|work=AP|via=The New York Times}}</ref> The film library was valued at $900 million.

=== Reliance-Spielberg joint venture ===
In June 2008, it reported that DreamWorks was looking for financing that would allow it to continue operations, but as an independent production company, once its deal with Paramount ended later that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/news/dreamworks-considers-indie-future-1117988086/|title=DreamWorks considers indie future|author=Anne Thompson|work=Variety}}</ref> Several public equity funds were approached for financing, including [[Blackstone Group]], Fuse Global, [[TPG Capital]] and several others, but all passed on the deal given their understanding of the Hollywood markets. In September 2008, it was announced that DreamWorks closed a deal with Indian investment firm [[Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group]] to create a $1.2 billion stand-alone production company and end its ties with Paramount.<ref name=GT-DEX-2008-CN-M-X>{{cite news|title=DreamWorks completes deal with Reliance ADA|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/09/23/industry-us-dreamworks-idUSTRE48M2T720080923|accessdate=September 25, 2012|date=September 22, 2008|work=Reuters}}</ref> In January 2009, Spielberg entered a licensing agreement with DreamWorks Animation to use the DreamWorks trademarks, logo, and name for film productions and releases.<ref name="dwa">{{cite news|last1=McClintock|first1=Pamela|title=Will Steven Spielberg Drop the DreamWorks Name?|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/will-steven-spielberg-drop-dreamworks-826201|accessdate=October 4, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 24, 2015}}</ref>

DreamWorks' slate of films in 2011, ''[[I Am Number Four (film)|I Am Number Four]]'', ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'', and ''[[Fright Night (2011 film)|Fright Night]]'' failed, while ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]'', ''[[Real Steel]]'' and Spielberg's ''[[War Horse (film)|War Horse]]'' had success at the box office. This left DreamWorks so financially drained that by 2011, the company was seeking additional funding from Reliance. Reliance gave a $200 million investment in April 2012. Under the deal, DreamWorks Pictures scaled back production to three films per year and sought co-financiers on big budget films, such as [[20th Century Fox]], who co-financed ''[[Lincoln (2012 film)|Lincoln]]'' and ''[[Bridge of Spies (film)|Bridge of Spies]]''. The company continued to utilize Disney's marketing unit.<ref name=lat0 />  In August that year, after renegotiating their agreement with Disney, DreamWorks formed a deal with [[Mister Smith Entertainment]] to distribute its films in [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]], while Disney would continue to distribute in North America, Latin America, Australia, Russia, and some territories in Asia.<ref name=lat1>{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=DreamWorks replaces Disney with new international partner|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-dreamworks-international-20120829,0,2191198.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 29, 2012}}</ref>
