The PRL grew out of the [[French Community of Belgium|Francophone]] part of the unitary liberal [[Party for Freedom and Progress]] (PVV-PLP) in 1971 and merged into the [[Mouvement Réformateur|Reformist Movement]] (RM) in 2002.

==History==
In 1971, the [[Party for Freedom and Progress]] (PVV-PLP), inheritor to the historical [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]] of Belgium, split into a Flemish and a Francophone party,<ref>{{Citation |first1=John T. |last1=Ishiyama |author-link1=John Ishiyama |first2=Marijke |last2=Breuning |title=Ethnopolitics in the New Europe |publisher=Lynne Rienner |year=1998 |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTdaIcZOkg0C&pg=PA122&dq=liberal+reformist+party+belgium&hl=de&sa=X&ei=9wcPT5_0KsanhAeumvyQAg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=liberal%20reformist%20party%20belgium&f=false |accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> anticipating the political devolution bill of 1980. Initially keeping the French version of the old party name (''Parti de la liberté et du progrès''), the party relaunched as the ''Party of Reforms and Freedom of Wallonia'' (Parti des réformes et de la liberté de Wallonie, PRLW) after taking over the [[Walloon Rally]]. In Brussels, the French-speaking Liberals co-operated intensively with the [[Fédéralistes Démocrates Francophones|Democratic Front of the Francophones]] (FDF). In 1979, the Francophone liberals of the capital merged into the PRLW, which took the new name of Liberal Reformist Party (PRL).

The Walloon liberals participated in the federal government from 1973 to 1977 ([[Edmond Leburton|Leburton]] governments I-II, [[Leo Tindemans|Tindemans]] governments I-III), in 1980 ([[Wilfried Martens|Martens]] government III), from 1981 to 1988 (Martens governments V-VII), and from 1999 to 2003 ([[Verhofstadt I Government]]).

In 1993, the PRL formed an alliance with the [[Fédéralistes Démocrates Francophones|Democratic Front of the Francophones]] (FDF), a party standing up for the rights of French-speakers in and around Brussels. In 1998, the [[Citizens' Movement for Change]], a split-off from the [[Centre démocrate humaniste|Christian Social Party]], joined the alliance, making it the PRL-FDF-MCC Federation. On a congress in 2002, the German-speaking liberals of the [[Partei für Freiheit und Fortschritt|Party for Freedom and Progress]] also joined and the alliance took the name of [[Mouvement Réformateur|Reformist Movement]] (MR). After this congress, the PRL completely merged in the MR.
