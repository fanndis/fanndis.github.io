'''Interscope Geffen A&M Records''' ('''IGA'''), also known as '''A&M Records Group''', is an American umbrella label owned by [[Universal Music Group]], consisting of [[record label]]s [[Interscope Records]], [[Geffen Records]], and [[A&M Records]].

==History==
 
Interscope Geffen A&M Records was established in 1999, following the [[PolyGram]] and [[MCA Music Entertainment]] merger (which created [[Universal Music Group|UMG]]). The label group was created by combining the MCA labels [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] and [[Geffen Records]] with the PolyGram-owned [[A&M Records|A&M]], which, at the time, became dormant. The label operated as one of the newly formed [[Universal Music Group]]'s four umbrella companies, the other three being The [[Universal Motown Republic Group]], [[Verve Records]] and [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]].<ref name="Strauss Merger NYT">{{cite news|last1=Neil|first1=Strauss|title=A Major Merger Shakes Up the World of Rock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/21/arts/a-major-merger-shakes-up-the-world-of-rock.html|accessdate=27 September 2015|work=New York Times|date=December 21, 1998}}</ref>

As a result of the merger, a significant percentage of artists and bands were dropped from A&M and Geffen, and though both continued to exist as labels, 280 jobs were eliminated and A&M's [[Charlie Chaplin Studios|Charlie Chaplin lot]] offices were closed.  The reorganization, expected to produce $300 million in savings annually, was described by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as underscoring the "changing economics and direction of the music business."<ref name="LA Times AM close">{{cite news|last1=Hilburn, Robert and|first1=Phillips, Chuck|title=A&M Records Closes; Geffen Lays of|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/22/news/mn-524|accessdate=27 September 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 22, 1999}}</ref><ref name="artist drop EW">{{cite news|last1=Essex|first1=Andrew|title=Music merger orphans artists|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/07/23/music-merger-orphans-artists|accessdate=27 September 2015|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 23, 1999}}</ref>

As independent labels, A&M and Geffen were revered and had achieved substantial commercial and artistic success. Both had been sold by their founders, however, and both had suffered from budget restraints and unproductive band signings over the previous years.  At the time of the merger neither label had records in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 40 while Interscope had "defined the new sound of young America" with hit records from artists including [[Dr. Dre]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[No Doubt]], [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[Bush (band)|Bush]], among others.  Interscope co-founders [[Jimmy Iovine]] and [[Ted Field]] were named co-chairmen of IGA at its launch.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hilburn|first1=Robert|title=This Cut Is the Deepest|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/23/entertainment/ca-734/2|accessdate=1 October 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 23, 1999}}</ref><ref name="Wild Rolling Stone">{{cite news|last1=Wild|first1=David|title=Interscope Records: Inside the Hit Factory|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/interscope-records-inside-the-hit-factory-19970403|accessdate=1 October 2015|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=April 3, 1997}}</ref> 

In 2000 Universal Music Group became the first music corporation to break the $1-billion mark in [[EBITDA]] (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). The company held the top position in music sales with 28.03% market share, and Interscope was the top-selling Universal label, with an 8.97% market share.<ref name="LA T market share">{{cite news|last1=Hochman|first1=Steve|title=Being Bigger and Younger Sure Helped|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/31/entertainment/ca-6566|accessdate=1 October 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 31, 2000}}</ref> 

In 2003, UMG acquired [[DreamWorks Records]] and in 2004 DreamWorks was merged with IGA.  Artists including [[Blink-182]], [[Papa Roach]], [[Rise Against]], [[Nelly Furtado]], [[Lifehouse (band)|Lifehouse]], [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[the All-American Rejects]], [[Jimmy Eat World]] and [[Rufus Wainwright]] were moved to the Geffen and Interscope imprints.<ref name="Newman Billboard Dreamworks">{{cite news|last1=Newman|first1=Melinda|title=Anthhony Expected to Head DreamWorks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tw8EAAAAMBAJ&q=IGA+acquires+dreamworks&pg=PA11|accessdate=1 October 2015|publisher=Billboard|date=December 6, 2003}}</ref>

In 2010, IGA and [[19 Entertainment]] announced a strategic alliance to develop, distribute and globally market records by ''[[American Idol]]'' finalists and winning contestants.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Daily Double Staff|title=Tuesday, August 3, 2010IDOL TO UMG'S IGA|url=http://hitsdailydouble.com/news&id=281071|website=Hits Daily Double|publisher=Hits Magazine|accessdate=1 October 2015|date=August 3, 2010}}</ref>  In 2013, it fully acquired Octone Records, which had been established as a joint venture in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Associated Press|title=Interscope Geffen A&M forms new label|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-02-21-a-m-octone_x.htm|accessdate=1 October 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|date=February 21, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Billboard Staff|title=Interscope Geffen A&M Acquires Remaining Share of A&M/Octone Records|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/5748123/interscope-geffen-am-acquires-remaining-share-of-amoctone-records|accessdate=1 October 2015|publisher=Billboard|date=October 7, 2013}}</ref>
