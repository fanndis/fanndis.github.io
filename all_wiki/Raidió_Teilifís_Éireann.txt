RTÉ also publishes a weekly listings and lifestyle magazine, the ''[[RTÉ Guide]]''.

RTÉ is a statutory body, overseen by a board appointed by the [[Government of Ireland]], with general management in the hands of the [[RTÉ Executive Board|Executive Board]], headed by the Director-General. RTÉ is regulated by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]]. RTÉ is financed by [[Television licensing in the Republic of Ireland|television licence fee]] and through [[advertising]], with some of its services funded solely by advertising, while others are funded solely by the licence fee.

Radio Éireann, RTÉ's predecessor and at the time a section of the [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs|Department of Posts and Telegraphs]], was one of 23 founding organisations of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] in 1950.

==History==
:''This section deals with the history of RTÉ as an organisation. For details on this history of the various services see the separate articles on those services. For the history of the broadcasting service prior to 1960, see [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]] and [[RTÉ Radio 1]].''

===Establishment and name===
[[File:Montrose Studios Donnybrook 2.jpg|thumb|RTÉ campus entrance in Donnybrook]]

Broadcasting in Ireland began in 1926 with [[2RN]] in Dublin. From that date until June 1960 the broadcasting service (2RN, later Radio Éireann) operated as a section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and those working for the service were directly employed by the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] and regarded as [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|civil servants]].

RTÉ was established on 1 June 1960 (as ''Radio Éireann'') under the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960, the principal legislation under which it still operates. The existing Radio Éireann service was transferred to the new authority, which was also made responsible for the new television service (''Telefís Éireann''). The television service started broadcasting on 31 December 1961, from the [[Kippure]] transmitter site near [[Dublin]]. [[Eamonn Andrews]] was the first Chairman of Radio Éireann, the first director-general was Edward Roth. The name of the authority was changed, at the suggestion of [[Áine Ní Cheanainn]], to ''Radio Telefís Éireann''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1966/act/7/section/3/enacted/en/html|title=Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act 1966, Section 3: Change of corporate name of Authority|website=Irish Statute Book|accessdate=1 October 2020|date=10 March 1966}}</ref> by the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act 1966, and both the radio and television services became known as RTÉ in that year.

Section 113 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 changed the name of the organisation from "Radio Telefís Éireann" to "[[wikt:raidió|Raidió]] Teilifís Éireann", to reflect the current standard spelling of the name in Irish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/18/section/113/enacted/en/html|title= Broadcasting Act 2009, Section 16: Raidió Teilifís Éireann|website=Irish Statute Book|accessdate=2 October 2020|date=12 July 2009}}</ref> The spelling "Radio Telefís Éireann" remains carved in stone at the entrance to its headquarters in Dublin, Donnybrook.

===Broadcasting ban===
Under Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of the day could direct RTÉ "not to broadcast any matter, or any matter of any particular class".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1960/act/10/section/31/enacted/en/html|title=Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act 1960, Section 31: Directions by Minister|website=Irish Statute Book|accessdate=2 October 2020|date=12 April 1960}}</ref> In 1971 the first such directive was issued by [[Gerry Collins (politician)|Gerry Collins]], directing RTÉ not to broadcast "any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ceisteanna—Questions. Oral Answers (Resumed) - Broadcasting Act – Dáil Éireann (19th Dáil) – Thursday, 4 November 1971|website=Houses of the Oireachtas|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1971-11-04/179/|accessdate=2 October 2020}}</ref> A year later Collins dismissed the entire RTÉ Authority over a report of an interview with [[Seán Mac Stíofáin]], the [[Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army|chief of staff]] of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]]. RTÉ reporter Kevin O'Kelly had reported, not broadcast, his taped interview with Mac Stiofáin. He was jailed briefly for contempt in a court case arising out of the interview, when Mac Stiofáin was charged with IRA membership. O'Kelly refused to identify Mac Stiofáin's as the voice on his unbroadcast interview. The tape had been seized from his house by the [[Garda Síochána]] (police).

In 1976, Section 31 was amended by [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] as 1973-77 Minister for Posts & Telegraphs. He issued a new annually-based directive to the RTÉ authority, prohibiting the broadcast of interviews or reports of interviews with spokespersons for, or representatives of, [[Sinn Féin]], the IRA and other named organisations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1976/act/37/section/16/enacted/en/html|title=Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act 1976, Section 16: Amendment of section 31 of Principal Act|website=Irish Statute Book|accessdate=2 October 2020|date=21 December 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1977/si/7/made/en/print|title=Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 (Section 31) Order 1977|website=Irish Statute Book |date=20 January 1977|accessdate=1 October 2020}}</ref> RTÉ was also banned from broadcasting interviews or reports of interviews with spokespersons for any organisation banned in Northern Ireland under the UK's [[Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973]]. The directives were reissued on an annual basis, up to January 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/isbc/1960_10.html#associatedsecondary|title=Broadcasting Authority Act 1960: SIs made under the Act|website=Irish Statute Book |accessdate=2 October 2020}}</ref>

During the late 1970s, RTÉ was accused of extending the censorship rules into a system of self-censorship. A small minority of programme-makers also emerged who approved of Section 31, particularly supporters of the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] (formerly Sinn Féin the Workers' Party), including [[Eoghan Harris]], and Gerry Gregg who opposed that party's official policy. Opponents of censorship were portrayed as secret IRA sympathizers, including then reporter, later Irish President, Mary McAleese. She described the experience as, "the most difficult, the darkest, the worst time of my life".<ref>'It was the worst of times', The Road from Ardoyne, The Making of a President, Ray MacManais, Brandon Books, 2005.</ref>

The effect of the Section 31 ban was more severe than the [[1988–94 British broadcasting voice restrictions|censorship provision introduced in 1988]] in the United Kingdom. The UK ban prevented direct speech of censored individuals. Broadcasters then used actors' voices dubbing the recorded speech of censored persons. This was not permissible on RTÉ, which was prevented from broadcasting 'reports' of interviews. British broadcasters interpreted the term 'spokesperson' more loosely than RTÉ, that banned all Sinn Féin members whether or not they were speaking on behalf of the party. The BBC interviewed Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams as MP for West Belfast on 1 October 1990, speaking on unemployment in his constituency. Larry O'Toole, then an ordinary Sinn Féin member, mentioned this in a letter to RTÉ Director of News Joe Mulhollend on 30 October 1990, after O'Toole was banned by RTÉ as spokesperson for striking bakery workers. O'Toole then challenged the RTE ban in the High Court.<ref> See letter in 'RTE Staff Information Bulletin: opposing 1992 High Court ruling liberalising RTE's internal Section 31 censorship regime (Larry O'Toole case)', https://www.academia.edu/25202543/</ref> In 1992–93, in ''O'Toole vs RTÉ'', RTÉ was found by the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] and [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] to have illegally and unconstitutionally extended the censorship ban to Sinn Féin members who were not speaking on behalf of Sinn Féin. The RTÉ ban did not affect UK stations broadcasting in the Republic of Ireland as, until 1988 at least, viewers in the Republic were still able to hear the voices of Sinn Féin representatives.

===21st century===
In 2004, RTÉ and the [[Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications|Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources]] agreed that in future, RTÉ would operate under a Public Service Broadcasting Charter.

On 29 June 2005 the Minister appointed the members of a new RTÉ Authority, replacing the previous one appointed in June 2000. Fintan Drury, chairman of Platinum sports management, and also chairman of [[Paddy Power]] plc, was appointed chairman of RTÉ. The other members of the Authority are Maria Killian, Patricia King, Ian Malcolm, Patrick Marron, Una Ní Chonaire, Emer Finnan, Stephen O'Byrnes and Joe O'Brien. The new Authority would hold office for not more than three years. On 11 January 2006, Fintan Drury resigned as chairman of RTÉ, citing a potential conflict of interest in his role as an advisor to the organisers of the [[Ryder Cup]] golf tournament and as chairman of a broadcaster involved in a row over broadcasting rights. This occurred after Irish government proposals to add the tournament to the list of sports events which must be broadcast on free-to-air terrestrial television, to which [[British Sky Broadcasting]], the rights holders, were objecting. On 22 February 2006, Mary Finan was appointed Chairperson<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0221/rte.html |title=Mary Finan new Chair of RTÉ Authority |publisher=RTÉ.ie |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=7 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311075831/http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0221/rte.html |archivedate=11 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> of the RTÉ Authority.

In September 2006, the Government published the proposed text of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061109062100/http://www.econsultation.ie/ Broadcasting Bill 2006]. It proposed that RTÉ and TG4 would become separate [[Company Limited by Guarantee|companies limited by guarantee]], with the Minister as sole member of both companies (CLGs do not have shareholders). RTÉ would be legally obliged to agree a charter every five years and publish a statement of commitments every year, and be under the jurisdiction of the proposed [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]]. The bill was delayed, but was finally introduced into Dáil Éireann on 14 April 2008. The Broadcasting Act 2009<ref>NO. 18 OF 2009 (Signed into law by the [[President of Ireland]] on: 12 July 2009)</ref> retains RTÉ as a statutory corporation, but renamed the RTÉ Authority as the RTÉ Board and made changes to the way it is appointed. It also renamed the corporation ''Raidió Teilifís Éireann''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2008/2908/b2908s.pdf |title=Broadcasting Bill 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104184034/http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2008/2908/b2908s.pdf |archivedate=4 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0720/1224250946463.html|title=RTÉ name change fixes spelling error that lasted 40 years|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224203726/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0720/1224250946463.html|archivedate=24 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> with the ''[[Irish Times]]'' noting that this thereby fixed a "spelling error that lasted 40 years". In the meantime, the ''Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007'' awarded RTÉ control of one multiplex for [[digital terrestrial television]] and giving it responsibilities in relation to broadcasting outside the state. In line with this, RTÉ and the government were currently in discussions with regard to a new channel proposed for to launch outside the Republic, which initially had the working titles of ''Diaspora TV'', and later [[RTÉ International]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcmnr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/Diaspora+TV+to+be+on+air+by+next+St.+Patricks+Day.htm |title=Diaspora TV to be on air by next St. Patrick's Day  |accessdate=7 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321205545/http://www.dcmnr.gov.ie/Press%2BReleases/Diaspora%2BTV%2Bto%2Bbe%2Bon%2Bair%2Bby%2Bnext%2BSt.%2BPatricks%2BDay.htm |archivedate=21 March 2008 }}</ref> In April 2007, [[TG4]] became an independent statutory corporation, having previously been a [[wholly owned subsidiary]] of RTÉ since its inception. RTÉ continues to contribute programmes to the channel, including [[Nuacht TG4]].

In July 2007, RTÉ began participating in a HD trial in Dublin, showing programmes such as [[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]] and [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] matches. RTÉ announced its plan to launch two further television channels; one general entertainment channel – ''[[RTÉ Three]]'' (working name) – and a timeshift service for [[RTÉ One]] – ''RTÉ One +1'' (working name).<ref>[https://www.businesspost.ie/legacy/rte-aims-to-launch-new-channel-2-85025 ''RTE aims to launch new channel''] ''Sunday Business Post''</ref>

On 24 February 2009 the Minister for Communications, Energy, and Natural Resources, appointed the members of a new RTÉ Authority, replacing the previous one appointed in June 2006. [[Tom Savage (Irish media figure)|Tom Savage]] of the Communications Clinic was appointed chairman of RTÉ. The other members of the Authority were Patricia Quinn, Karlin Lillington, Fergus Armstrong, [[Alan Gilsenan]], Seán O'Sullivan, Emer Finnan. Cathal Goan then Director General, RTÉ as an ex-officio member of the Authority. The new Authority held office for not more than six months, due to changes planned under the [[Broadcasting Act 2009]] which became law on 12 July 2009, dissolving the authority, and replacing it with an RTÉ Board. Under Section 179 (3) of the Act, any person who was a member of the Authority when the Act was signed into law continues as a member of the Board until the end of their term of office on 24 August 2009. Unlike the RTÉ Authority, the RTÉ Board has not the self-regulatory function over RTÉ, as this was transferred to a newly appointed Broadcasting Authority of Ireland that replaces the [[Broadcasting Commission of Ireland]] regulating commercial TV and radio. This helps assuage any concerns of the potential for bias that could be perceived under previous self-regulation by having a single regulator of public service and commercial Irish broadcasters into the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0224/114403-rteauthority/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117142821/https://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0224/114403-rteauthority/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 November 2019 |title= Minister announces new RTÉ Authority |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}</ref>

RTÉ receives income from two main sources:
* The television [[Television licensing in the Republic of Ireland|licence fee]]. Within the State, it is necessary to pay a fee of €160 ''per annum'' to legally possess any piece of equipment capable of receiving television signals (not necessarily those of RTÉ). This money is collected by [[An Post]] on behalf of the [[Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media]]. The state pays for TV Licence Inspectors who have the power to obtain and execute search warrants of private houses. Failure to possess a valid television licence can result in a fine and a criminal record.
* Commercial revenue including the sale of advertising and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]]. In the early 1990s Minister [[Ray Burke (Irish politician)|Ray Burke]] imposed commercial revenue quotas to limit the amount of revenue that RTÉ could procure through advertising, in view of the corporation's licence fee income. While such quotas were later removed RTÉ Radio and Television is still limited to 6 minutes of advertising per hour{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. The commercial division owned 0.086% of the [[Intelsat]] satellite firm, which it sold in 2005.

Even though commercial quotas have been removed, commercial revenue and the license fee each contribute roughly half of the organization's income. The licence fee does not fund [[RTÉ 2fm]], [[RTÉ Aertel]], ''[[RTÉ Guide]]'' or the website [[RTÉ.ie]],<ref name="RTÉ Annual Report 2009" />, however, each of these brands are indirectly funded by the licence fee through the use of content that is funded by the licence fee, such as News and Current Affairs.

===RTÉ personality salaries===
RTÉ's Director General in October 2009 said there was "no question that by today's standards" the salaries paid to its top presenters in 2008 "were excessive. I have to repeat that they were set at a different time in a different competitive reality where some of this talent might be up for poaching by other organisations and in RTÉ's view at the time, they delivered value for money ".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/1010/breaking7.htm |title=Sat, Oct&nbsp;10, 2009 – RTÉ pay 'excessive' by today's standards |work=The Irish Times  |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref> [[Fine Gael]] said the high salaries were "rubbing salt in the wounds" for people who had lost their jobs or taken significant pay cuts. Labour criticised RTÉ for not releasing the data sooner and said "This information should be easily available and there should be no question of concealing it or making it in any way inaccessible ".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/stations-golden-10-share-a-836445m-bonanza-1909991.html|title=Kenny tops the RTÉ richlist|publisher=Independent.ie|author=Clarke, Denise|date=10 October 2009}}</ref> Many of the highest-paid stars are not technically members of staff but are paid through separate companies, enabling them and the station to avoid paying tax on their salaries.<ref>{{cite news|author=Business year |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/tax-squeeze-on-highpaid-tv-stars-2052069.html |title=Tax squeeze on high-paid TV stars&nbsp;– National News, Frontpage |work=The Irish Independent |date= 7 February 2010|accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref>

In December 2018, RTÉ published the list of salaries paid to its top 10 personalities in 2016:

# [[Ryan Tubridy]]: €495,000
# [[Ray D'Arcy]]: €450,000
# [[Joe Duffy]]: €389,988

RTÉ Director-General, Dee Forbes, said: “The audited figures released today for 2016 sees RTÉ maintain our commitment to reduce these earnings by 30% as compared to 2008 levels, while continuing to value the significant contribution our presenters make, and to RTÉ’s ability to optimise commercial revenue to support Ireland’s public media.

"This will continue to be an area of focus for me. Within a challenging marketplace and in the absence of meaningful funding reform, we are making significant efforts to reduce costs across the organisation, in addition to the considerable reduction in operating costs implemented since 2008.”<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/here-are-the-latest-earnings-for-rtes-top-10-presenters-891635.html |title = Here are the latest earnings for RTE's top 10 presenters|date = 12 December 2018}}</ref>

==Organisation==
{{Main|RTÉ Authority|RTÉ Executive|Director-General of RTÉ}}

===RTÉ Board and Executive Board===
RTÉ is a statutory corporation. Under its original governance arrangements (under the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960) its board was known as the RTÉ Authority. The members of the RTÉ Authority were appointed by the Cabinet upon the recommendation of the [[Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications|Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources]]. The RTÉ Authority was both the legal owner of RTÉ (under the 1960 Act, it ''was'' RTÉ) and was also its regulator.

Under the [[Broadcasting Act 2009]], RTÉ's governance arrangements have changed. The statutory corporation form has been retained, but the new Act no longer refers to the board of RTÉ as an "Authority" and it is now simply known as the Board. Of the 12 members of the Board which replaced the RTÉ Authority, the Minister appoints six, the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Climate and Communications decides on four names to present to the Minister for appointment, one member is elected by the staff of RTÉ, and the Director General sits on the Board ''ex officio''. The final members of the RTÉ Authority were reappointed to the new Board in the interim.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/about/executiveboard.html |title=About RTÉ |publisher=RTÉ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917222907/http://www.rte.ie/about/executiveboard.html |archivedate=17 September 2009 }}</ref> The provisions of the Act relating to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland were commenced on 1 October 2009 (under [[Statutory Instrument]] 389 of 2009 of the [[Broadcasting Act 2009]]), RTÉ is externally regulated by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]].

The RTÉ organisation is divided into six integrated business divisions (termed "IBDs" within RTÉ): [[RTÉ Television]], [[RTÉ Radio]], [[RTÉ News and Current Affairs]], [[2RN (RTÉ Networks)|RTÉ Network]], [[RTÉ Digital]] and [[RTÉ Performing Groups|RTÉ Orchestras Quartet & Choirs]], together with Centrally Incurred Shared Services (Group Communications, Legal & Treasury, Central HR & IT Support, Group Insurance & Pension, Property and Site Facilities, ''RTÉ Guide'' Production, Publication & Advertising Sales) and a Corporate Headquarters. The Irish-language channel, [[TG4]], was operated as a subsidiary of RTÉ (Serbhisí Telefís na Gaeilge Teoranta) prior to its separation from RTÉ on 1 April 2007.

The RTÉ Board appoints the [[Director-General of RTÉ]] who in effect fulfils the dual role of chief executive and of Editor in Chief. The Director-General heads the Executive Board of RTÉ, which comprises the company's top management and includes the chief financial officer, the Director of Communications and the Managing Directors of the Television, Radio, and News divisions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Members of the RTÉ Executive Board |url=http://www.rte.ie/about/executiveboard.html |work=[[RTÉ.ie|RTÉ Press Centre]] |accessdate=13 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101104549/http://www.rte.ie/about/executiveboard.html |archivedate=1 November 2010 }}</ref>

==Broadcasting==

===Radio===
{{Main|RTÉ Radio}}
The first voice broadcast of [[2RN]], the original radio [[callsign]] for Radio 1, took place on 14 November 1925 when Seamus Clandillon, the 2RN station director said, 'Seo Raidió 2RN, Baile Átha Cliath ag tástáil', Irish for 'This is Radio 2RN, Dublin calling'. Regular Irish radio-broadcasting began on 1 January 1926. Unfortunately, most Irish people could not receive 2RN's (1.5 kilowatt) signal. When faced with numerous complaints from Cork regarding the writers' inability to tune to the signal, Clandillon remarked in ''The Irish Radio Review'', a magazine dedicated to the service, that they did not know how to operate their sets. 6CK was established in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1927; much of 6CK's output was simply a relay of the national service but it also had a significant input into the programmes of 2RN until it was closed down in the 1950s.

[[File:Montrose Studios Donnybrook.jpg|thumb|RTÉ links mast at [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]] campus]]
A high-power (initially 60&nbsp;kW) station was established in [[Athlone]], in 1932, to coincide with the staging of the [[Eucharistic Congress]]. 2RN, 6CK and Athlone became known as "Radio Athlone" ({{lang-ga|Raidió Áth Luain|links=no}}) and were receivable across virtually the entire country. Radio Athlone became known as "Radio Éireann" in 1938.

Radio Éireann tried to satisfy all tastes on a single channel (with very limited programming hours). However, this resulted in a rather conservative programming policy. It was barely tolerated by most Irish listeners, and usually trounced (particularly on the east coast and along the [[Northern Ireland]] border) by the [[BBC]] and later [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} This did not really change until Radio Éireann became free of direct government control in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gorham|first=Maurice|title=Forty Years of Irish Broadcasting|year=1967|publisher=Talbot Press|isbn=0854520279}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=December 2013}}<br />
In 1973 the radio service moved from the GPO in the centre of Dublin, where it had been housed since 1928, into a new purpose-built [[RTÉ Radio Centre|Radio Centre]] beside the existing [[RTÉ Television Centre|Television Centre]] on the Donnybrook campus.
[[File:RTÉ clock.jpg|thumb|Clock at RTÉ buildings, [[Cork (city)|Cork]]]]

Now, RTÉ has a nationwide communications network with an increasing emphasis on regional news-gathering and input. Broadcasting on [[RTÉ Radio 1|Radio 1]] provides comprehensive coverage of news, current affairs, music, drama and variety features, agriculture, education, religion and sport, mostly in English but also some Irish. [[RTÉ 2fm]] is a popular music and chat channel which commenced broadcasting as RTÉ Radio 2 on 31 May 1979, Brendan Balfe being the first voice to be heard on the station at midday when he introduced the first presenter, Larry Gogan. [[RTÉ lyric fm]] serves the interests of classical music and the arts, coming on air in May 1999, and replacing FM3 Classical Music, which had catered for the same target audience and time-shared with [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]], an exclusively Irish language service, which first began broadcasting on Easter Sunday, 2 April 1972.
Formerly RTÉ operated [[RTÉ Radio Cork]] (previously 'Cork 89FM' and 'RTÉ Cork Local Radio'), a local radio service in Cork, but this closed down in 2000.

A slightly adapted version of Radio 1 is broadcast as RTÉ Europe on [[Eurobird]]; the main difference between this and the main FM feed is the inclusion of several programmes taken from RTÉ Radio na Gaeltachta.

[[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] test broadcasts of RTÉ's four stations began on 1 January 2006, along the east coast of Ireland, also carrying the private [[Today FM]] and [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]], to which RTÉ is a contributing broadcaster. DAB was launched to the public in late 2006, and now contains six RTÉ digital-only stations&nbsp;– [[RTÉ 2XM]], [[RTÉ Chill]], [[RTÉ Gold]], [[RTÉ Junior]], [[RTÉ Pulse]] and [[RTÉ Radio 1 Extra]]&nbsp;– as well as the four terrestrial services. There were also two other DAB Services, [[RTÉ Digital Radio News]] and [[RTÉ Choice]], both of which have been shut down. RTÉ's radio stations are also carried on digital cable and satellite platforms in Ireland, as well as on [[digital terrestrial television]], and RTÉ Radio 1 has been carried on shortwave in [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] during specific events, including the [[All Ireland]] finals.

A survey carried out by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs showed that demand for an Irish-language radio station aimed at a younger audience than [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]] was high. This means that RTÉ might have plans to launch such a radio station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://u.tv/newsroom/indepth.asp?id=55609 |title=UTV News&nbsp;– ''Demand grows for second Irish language station'' |publisher=U.tv |accessdate=13 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303161330/http://u.tv/newsroom/indepth.asp?id=55609 |archivedate=3 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In August 2009, faced with falling audience listening figures, a media analyst, David Quinn, organiser of the religiously-motivated "Iona Institute" pressure group, advised that RTÉ has "alienated some of the audience it ought to be going after" and should "try to be more even-handed in its treatment of the issues of the day instead of pushing every PC cause going."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/rte-hasnt-got-a-prayer-of-attracting-young-listeners-1865936.html|title=RTÉ hasn't got a prayer of attracting young listeners|author=Quinn, David|work=The Irish Independent|date=21 August 2009}}</ref>

With the closure of Saor Raidió Chonamara ("Free Radio Connemara"), it showed the importance and it showed awareness for the Irish language. With this in mind, it forced RTÉ to agree to join with Raidió na Gaeltachta, which is still present today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.2rn.ie/|title=2rn {{!}}|website=www.2rn.ie|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125214510/http://www.2rn.ie/|archivedate=25 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Television===
{{Main|RTÉ Television}}
In the Republic of Ireland, [[RTÉ One]] and [[RTÉ2]] are RTÉ's flagship channels and are broadcast on [[Saorview]] (Ireland's digital television system) along with, [[RTÉ News Now]], [[RTÉjr]] and timeshift services, RTÉ One +1, and RTÉ2+1. RTÉ Television also offers two further services: RTÉ Live, where viewers can watch RTÉ as it broadcasts live on the internet, using programming from both RTÉ One and RTÉ2 and [[RTÉ Player]] an on-demand video service. Both of these services are available on a national and international basis.
* '''Timeline'''

;1920s:
Ireland was one of the first countries in Europe to embrace the medium of radio, but was a relative latecomer to television. Unlike its European counterparts, the Government of Ireland did not use the medium of television until 31 December 1961. Countries such as the United Kingdom (1929), France (1935) and Italy (1954) embraced television long before Ireland. Prior to the launch of the Republic of Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ, television services were available, though limited, from Northern Ireland through [[BBC Northern Ireland]] (1955) and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] (1959) . The development of the [[Divis transmitting station|Divis]] transmitter in Northern Ireland in July 1955 allowed overspill of these services into the Republic.

;1950s:
In the late 1950s, a ''Television Committee'' was formed; its goal was to set up an Irish television service with as little financial support from the government.<ref>{{cite book |author=Television Commission |title=Report |url=http://opac.oireachtas.ie/AWData/Library3/Library2/DL005698.pdf |date=May 1959 |publisher=[[Department of Posts and Telegraphs]] |location=Dublin |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808034052/http://opac.oireachtas.ie/AWData/Library3/Library2/DL005698.pdf |archivedate=8 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It initially recommended setting up a service along the lines of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], using five mountain tops as transmission sites, which were also equipped for [[FM radio]] transmission. However, since [[Éamon de Valera]] was somewhat wary of television, nothing more of consequence was done until [[Seán Lemass]] succeeded him as [[Taoiseach]] in 1959. A year later, Radio Éireann was converted from an arm of the [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs|Department of Posts and Telegraphs]] into a [[state-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland|semi-state body]] and given responsibility for television. [[Eamonn Andrews]] was appointed as the new chairman. A site for a new [[RTÉ Television Centre|Television Production Centre]] had been found in 1959, and its construction started in October 1960.

;1960s:
Telefís Éireann began broadcasting at 19:00 on New Year's Eve, 1961. The channel was launched with opening address by the then [[President of Ireland|President de Valera]]. There were other messages from [[John D'Alton|Cardinal d'Alton]] and Lemass; following this, a live concert was broadcast from the Gresham Hotel in [[Dublin]]. The show, which was a countdown to the New Year, was hosted by Andrews, with appearances by tenor Patrick O'Hagan (father of [[Johnny Logan (singer)|Johnny Logan]]), the [[Artane, Dublin#Artane Band|Artane Boys' Band]] and [[Michael O'Hehir]]. Television became an important force within Irish culture as it helped to explore topics often deemed controversial such as [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|abortion]] and contraception. The development of entertainment show ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'', began in July 1962 and is still broadcasting today. Such programming helped to influence in the changing social structure of Ireland. Telefís Éireann began to explore children's television at this point producing the groundbreaking show [[Wanderly Wagon]] which inspired a generation with characters like Judge and Mr Crow.

;1970s:
In 1978, the Government of Ireland approved the launch of a second public service channel to be operated by RTÉ. [[RTÉ Two|RTÉ2]] (later rebranded as Network 2 in 1988 and renamed RTÉ Two in 2004) had a public service remit providing Irish-language services, while also offering alternative services - mainly programming from the US and UK.

;1990s:
During the 1990s similar to other European broadcasters RTÉ began to expand its services to provide regional variations. RTÉ developed its only major studio complex outside Dublin in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. [[RTÉ Cork]], opened in 1995 and became a huge success. It also became a large contributor to network output on both Radio One and RTÉ One. Also in 1995, RTÉ opened a regional broadcasting studio in Limerick for broadcasts in the Limerick area. In 1996, an Irish-language television service was launched [[TG4]] (previously Teilifís na Gaeilge) was launched from [[Galway]]. While RTÉ provided Irish-language services such as news bulletins (''Nuacht'') and the long-running documentary series ''Léargas''.

;2000s:
RTÉ Television began to expand is output through the development of digital television. RTÉ Television services became widely available in [[Northern Ireland]] via terrestrial overspill or on [[cable TV|cable]] (coverage and inclusion on cable systems varies). Since 23 April 2002, (18 April 2005 in Northern Ireland) the channels have also been available via satellite on SKY; however, some sports programmes are blocked to Northern Ireland viewers due to rights issues which conflict with the UK.

In January 2007, RTÉ announced plans to launch a channel, with the working title of [[RTÉ International]], which would offer programmes from RTÉ One and Two as well as TG4.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Sunday Times|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2091-2546385,00.html|title=RTÉ to launch expat service|date=14 January 2007 | location=London | first=John | last=Burns | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> however as of 2017 this service has still to materialise.

;2010s:
On 26 May 2011, RTÉ television launched the public service Mux for digital terrestrial television known as [[Saorview]] and [[Saorsat]]. RTÉ also launched [[RTÉ Two]] HD, [[RTÉjr]], [[RTÉ One]]+1 and [[RTÉ News Now]] on Saorview on the same day.
<br />
For the 50th anniversary of the start of RTÉ television [[John Bowman (broadcaster)|John Bowman]] produced a history of RTÉ Television titled: ''Window and Mirror. RTÉ Television: 1961–2011'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowman|first=John|title=Window and Mirror RTÉ television: 1961–2011|year=2011|publisher=The Collins Press|location=Cork|isbn=978-18488-9135-7}}</ref> which was launched by [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] at the National Museum in Dublin on 23 November 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1124/bowmanbook.html|title=John Bowman's history of RTÉ book launched|date=24 November 2011|accessdate=24 November 2011|work=RTÉ News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128004941/http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1124/bowmanbook.html|archivedate=28 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
<br />
At 10:00&nbsp;am on 24 October 2012 all analogue television transmissions ended in Ireland,<ref>{{cite web|title=RTÉ One analogue switch-off 24/10/2012 (Spur Hill)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHiRmZELTIo|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=30 December 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716213729/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHiRmZELTIo|archivedate=16 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and RTÉ's television channels are now only available digitally on [[Saorview]], satellite, and cable. Also on 24 October 2012, for the first time RTÉ 1 and RTÉ 2 were broadcast from transmitters within Northern Ireland on the UK [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] system.

In December 2014, RTÉ made [[television advertising]] history by airing the first-ever native HD advert in the UK and Ireland. The commercial was part of the [[3 Mobile]] Christmas campaign. It was created by Dublin [[creative agency]] Boys & Girls and was delivered by global delivery specialists IMD.<ref name="RTÉ Score a First in HD Ad Delivery">{{cite web | title=RTÉ Score a First in HD Ad Delivery | publisher=AdWorld | url=http://www.adworld.ie/news/read/?id=c1e548e6-2621-4c67-b190-54c9ecdc9b0c | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209192946/http://www.adworld.ie/news/read/?id=c1e548e6-2621-4c67-b190-54c9ecdc9b0c | archivedate=9 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

It is, by far, the largest and most popular news source in Ireland&nbsp;– with 77% of the Irish public regarding it as their main source of both Irish and international news.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}<ref name="RTÉ News and Current Affairs">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/about/literature/news.pdf|title=RTÉ News and Current Affairs|publisher=RTÉ|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819213842/http://www.rte.ie/about/literature/news.pdf|archivedate=19 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It broadcasts in both the Irish and English languages, as well as [[Irish Sign Language]].

RTÉ News and Current Affairs provides a range of national and international news and current affairs programming in Ireland. The organisation is also a source of commentary on current affairs. RTÉ News is based at the RTÉ Television Complex at Montrose in [[Donnybrook, Dublin]], Ireland. However, the station also operates regional bureaux across Ireland and the world.

RTÉ News faces competition from within Ireland and abroad. Within Ireland, competition is provided by [[TV3 News|3News]] and [[Nuacht TG4]] in the television sector and [[Communicorp]] in the radio sector. [[BBC Newsline]] and [[UTV Live]] provide alternative news services from Northern Ireland, whilst global news channels are widely available, such as [[Euronews]], [[CNN International]], [[CNBC]], [[France 24]], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], [[BBC World News]] and [[Sky News]] among many others.

RTÉ News and Current Affairs produces over 1,000 hours of television programming and 2,000 hours of radio programming a year.<ref name="Hayes, Maurice">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/peeling-back-the-truth-about-the-stickies-1909920.html|title=Peeling back the truth about the stickies|author=Hayes, Maurice|work=The Irish Independent|date=10 October 2009}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Sinn Féin the Workers Party, (the political wing of the Official IRA), were said to have progressively infiltrated RTÉ's Current Affairs Department, through the Ned Stapleton Cumman, which was organised by [[Eoghan Harris]].<ref name="Hayes, Maurice"/>

RTÉ's gaffe in January 2009 over the need for IMF intervention in the Republic was picked up by news wires. Bloomberg noted how German stocks fell sharply, while Reuters reported that the euro dipped by a cent against the dollar before it stabilised following a strong denial.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0120/1232059661794.html|title=European journalists deliver the last rites to Celtic Tiger|work=The Irish Times|date=20 January 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825003803/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0120/1232059661794.html|archivedate=25 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

RTÉ's producers and researchers were accused by journalist [[Kevin Myers]] of imposing a liberal agenda, firstly on one another, and later on the airwaves, but without consciously intending to do so.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/kevin-myers/rte-canteen-is-most-important-place-in-setting-liberal-agenda-1688580.html|title=RTÉ canteen is most important place in setting liberal agenda|work=The Irish Independent|author=Myers, Kevin|date=27 March 2009}}</ref> RTÉ News has also been described by him as behaving like a press officer for public sector unions.<ref>{{cite news|author=independent.ie phone apps |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/eoghan-harris/rte-must-report-both-sides-on-public-sector-pay-1806556.html |title=RTÉ must report both sides on public sector pay&nbsp;– Eoghan Harris, Columnists |work=The Irish Independent |date= 5 July 2009|accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref>

===Sport===
{{Main|RTÉ Sport}}

RTÉ is a major broadcaster of sports programming in Ireland. [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], football and rugby are all broadcast live on radio and television and increasingly online. The broadcaster also transmits live golf, boxing, athletics, horse-racing and show-jumping and other minority sports, usually when there is a significant Irish participant(s), or the event is in Ireland. The broadcaster has secured many events, [[free-to-air]] which might otherwise become pay-per-view.

===Weather===
Weather forecasts are provided at the end of most news on radio and television. [[Met Éireann]] have been providing the forecasts since 1948 to Radio Éireann and from 1962 on television broadcasts.

====Saorview====
{{Main|Saorview}}
''Saorview'', founded by [[2RN (RTÉ Networks)|2RN]], is the name for the Irish FTA DTT.<ref>{{cite web |last=McCaughren |first=Samantha |url=http://www.sbpost.ie/news/ireland/rte-plans-for-saorview-digital-tv-service-46949.html |title=RTE plans for Saorview digital TV service |work=Daily Business Post |date=24 January 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210065224/http://www.sbpost.ie/news/ireland/rte-plans-for-saorview-digital-tv-service-46949.html |archivedate=10 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The service was launched as a trial service on 31 October 2010 to 90% of the population and it was officially launched on 26 May 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=DTT to be launched on 31&nbsp;October|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0601/dtt.html|accessdate=21 July 2010|newspaper=[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs|RTÉ News]]|date=1 June 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731162730/http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0601/dtt.html|archivedate=31 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Set-top boxes for the service are available<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0601/dtt.html |title=DTT to be launched on 31&nbsp;October&nbsp;– RTÉ News |publisher=RTÉ.ie |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222130522/http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0601/dtt.html |archivedate=22 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> By legislation it must be available nationwide by December 2011. The service is free although a MPEG-4 DVB-T box and a UHF aerial will be needed although some newer TV sets have MPEG-4 DVB-T decoders built into the TV set which do not need a separate box. 2RN can provide for commercial DTT capacity on its network for any [[Television in Ireland#Historical testing|pay TV service]] that can agree terms with it and the BAI. However that is likely until 2013 according to the BAI following on from a de-briefing exercise the BAI held with the three consortia involved in the 2008 failed license process. The BAI said "the Authority now considers that it will not be feasible to introduce commercial DTT as originally intended until after Analogue Switch Off (ASO) at the earliest. The position will be reviewed towards the end of 2011 and the Authority may seek expressions of interest in the provision of commercial DTT at that point. A competition could potentially be held during 2012 with a view to commercial DTT being operational in 2013." It continued "it is the considered view of the Authority that as part of the preparation for the successful launch of commercial DTT in the future, legislative change will be necessary to enable the Authority to have formal relationships with the applicants, as obtains at present, and with RTÉNL."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bai.ie/about_news_art023.html |title=BAI&nbsp;– Broadcasting Authority of Ireland&nbsp;– News |publisher=Bai.ie |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721122847/http://www.bai.ie/about_news_art023.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref><br />

=== Logo ===

In 1995, the logo dropped the Brigid's cross, and for the first time placed an accent ({{lang|ga|[[síneadh fada|fada]]}}) on the letter E. RTÉ also formal branded Network Two on screen as part of RTÉ until 1997, when the channel was once more re-branded on screen as N2. The three letters are a modern take on [[Celtic script]]ing. The Brigid's cross was seen on many RTÉ One television idents until 2003 and remains on the [[headed paper]] of RTÉ, while a variation of the 1966 cross is used by RTÉ's Graphic Design Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RTEGraphics|title=RTÉ Graphic Design (RTEGraphics) – Twitter|accessdate=17 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119075633/https://twitter.com/RTEGraphics|archivedate=19 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since 2004 all RTÉ service use the 1996 logo as part of their Identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thetvroom.com/irish/te-010-gen-010.html|title=TÉ General Prentation 1961 to 1978|publisher=The TV Room|accessdate=19 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120717031303/http://thetvroom.com/irish/te-010-gen-010.html|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/player/#!v=1126346|title=Mailbag|last=Murphy|first=Aurthur|date=19 March 1987|publisher=RTÉ|accessdate=19 January 2012|location=Dublin|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820094004/http://www.rte.ie/player/#!v=1126346|archivedate=20 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/utv-challenge-sparks-rte-makeover-29987622.html | work=Irish Independent | title=UTV challenge sparks RTE makeover | date=7 February 2014}}</ref>

In October 2011, RTÉ issued a public apology, stating that the allegations were baseless and should never have been broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1006/apology.html|title=Apology – Fr Kevin Reynolds|date=6 October 2011|work=RTÉ.ie|accessdate=17 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213115459/http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1006/apology.html|archivedate=13 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1007/1224305388890.html "RTÉ apologises to Fr Kevin Reynolds"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007163403/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1007/1224305388890.html |date=7 October 2011 }}.

As a consequence, managing director of news Ed Mulhall retired, current affairs editor Ken O'Shea was moved to another department, and reporter [[Aoife Kavanagh]] resigned. The affair was described as "one of the gravest editorial mistakes ever made" in RTÉ's history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/1123/1224308004000.html?via=mr|title=RTÉ shelves investigative series and concedes 'grave mistake'|first=Paul|last=Cullen|author2=McGreevy, Ronan|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=23 November 2011|date=23 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123152242/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/1123/1224308004000.html?via=mr|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Moral controversies===
''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' has been involved in a number of controversies since first being broadcast on TV in July 1962, particularly during [[Gay Byrne]]'s tenure, with the "Bishop and the Nightie Affair" in 1966 and a 1985 interview with a pair of lesbian former nuns which led to protesters picketing the studio with hymns and rosary beads after a [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] case during which there were calls for the chat show to be outlawed over fears it would "greatly undermine Christian moral values" and "the respect of the general public for nuns".<ref name=sex_factor/> Notorious incidents during [[Pat Kenny]]'s tenure included a satanic dance troupe performance and the tearing up of two tickets for ''[[The Late Late Toy Show]]'' live on air.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/rte-viewers-raise-hell-over-late-late-satanic-show-1550830.html|title=RTÉ viewers raise hell over Late Late 'Satanic' show|date=24 November 2008|accessdate=25 November 2008|work=Irish Independent|first=Jason|last=O'Brien}}</ref>

The first sex scandal on Irish TV surrounded a sketch-drawing advert for [[Bri-Nylon]] underwear, involving a "lewd and lascivious" cartoon of [[Mark Antony|Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]].<ref name=sex_factor/>

Wesley Burroughs received a dressing down from RTÉ authorities after it became apparent actress Biddy White Lennon, who portrayed the character Maggie Riordan, was becoming increasingly more pregnant looking every week on ''[[The Riordans]]'', an RTÉ soap opera he wrote for. Maggie Riordan was an unmarried woman. Burroughs was forced to consult medical texts to provide Maggie with an alternative illness.<ref name=sex_factor/>

The TV drama series ''[[The Spike (TV series)|The Spike]]'', broadcast on RTÉ in 1978, was involved in a sex scandal.<ref name=sex_factor>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/relationships/the-sex-factor-1491630.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011043645/http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/relationships/the-sex-factor-1491630.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 October 2008|title=The Sex Factor|date=7 October 2008|accessdate=16 November 2008|work=Irish Independent}}</ref>

In 1986, [[Mandy Smith]] was to be interviewed on TV's ''Saturday Live'' until RTÉ decided she should be downgraded to being a mere member of the audience. She was axed entirely when her manager disagreed, with RTÉ saying she was "not important enough" and that she might "give a bad example to young teenage girls". The story appeared in the international media.<ref name=sex_factor/>

===Political controversies===

In 2009, RTÉ apologised to the then [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] for its role in the [[Brian Cowen nude portraits controversy]]. Future Taoiseach [[Enda Kenny]]<ref name="Ceann Comhairle exasperated as Kenny fails to see the bigger picture">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0327/1224243552769.html|title=Ceann Comhairle exasperated as Kenny fails to see the bigger picture|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009|work=The Irish Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302231103/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/ceann-comhairle-exasperated-as-kenny-fails-to-see-the-bigger-picture-1.731374|archivedate=2 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Charles Flanagan]] called RTÉ's backtracking a restriction on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]],<ref name="Teacher questioned over Cowen paintings">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0325/cowenb.html|title=Teacher questioned over Cowen paintings|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009|work=[[RTÉ News]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328063518/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0325/cowenb.html|archivedate=28 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Opposition slams Govt over portrait pressure">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0326/cowenb.html|title=Opposition slams Govt over portrait pressure|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=28 March 2009|work=[[RTÉ News]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302231227/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0326/115596-cowenb/|archivedate=2 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Liz McManus]] of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] criticised RTÉ for "bow[ing] to political pressure".<ref name="Opposition slams Govt over portrait pressure"/>

In September 2010, RTÉ broadcast a controversial nine-minute radio interview with Taoiseach [[Brian Cowen]] from a [[Fianna Fáil]] think-in in [[Galway]]. The interview led to increased pressure for Cowen to resign in the days that followed after it was thought he had been drunk on the radio.<ref>{{cite news|author=McDonald, Henry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/20/irish-pm-brian-cowen-drunk-allegations|title=Irish PM Brian Cowen under pressure after 'drunk' radio interview|date=20 September 2010|accessdate=20 September 2010|work=The Guardian|location=London|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923124444/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/20/irish-pm-brian-cowen-drunk-allegations|archivedate=23 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 24 October 2011, three days before the [[2011 Irish presidential election]], RTÉ hosted the final presidential debate on [[Pat Kenny]]'s ''[[The Frontline (Irish TV programme)|The Frontline]]'', in which it controversially broadcast an unverified [[Twitter|tweet]] mid-debate which was widely seen as damaging to the frontrunner candidate [[Seán Gallagher|Sean Gallagher]].<ref name="patl">{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/how-se%C3%A1n-gallagher-nearly-became-president-of-ireland-in-2011-1.3611550|title=How Seán Gallagher nearly became president of Ireland in 2011|date=29 August 2018|author=Pat Leahy|newspaper=[[Irish Times]]}}</ref> Gallagher had been the frontrunner in an opinion poll at this point.<ref>McDonald, Henry.
