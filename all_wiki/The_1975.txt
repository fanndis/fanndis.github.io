"A Change of Heart" premiered on Radio 1 on 22 February, four days prior to the album's release.

''[[NME]]'', who had previously been highly critical of the band, praised the album for its scope and ambition, writing that "Any record that burrows as deep into your psyche as ‘I Like It…' should be considered essential. It's hugely clever and wryly funny, too." They later named it their Album of the Year for 2016. <ref>{{Cite web|last=Bartleet|first=Larry|date=27 November 2016|title=NME's Albums of the Year 2016|url=https://www.nme.com/list/nme-best-albums-2016-1869261|access-date=12 June 2020|website=NME}}</ref> Although music journalist [[Alexis Petridis]] noted that parts of the album were over-ambitious, he went on to claim that "incredibly, though, most of the time Healy gets away with it. That's sometimes because his observations are sharp – as a skewering of celebrity squad culture, 'you look famous, let's be friends / And portray we possess something important / And do the things we like' is pretty acute – but more usually because they come loaded with witty self-awareness and deprecation: the endless depictions of vacuous, coke-numbed girls he has met would get wearying were it not for the fact that he keeps turning the lyrical crosshair on himself." In a more mixed review, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' criticised tracks like 'Lostmyhead' and 'Please Be Naked' for being 'boring-melty' but praised songs such as 'Somebody Else', 'Loving Someone' and 'Love Me'.{{cn|date=March 2020}}

Public reaction to the band's music has been mixed, particularly on social media platforms like [[Twitter]], "perhaps the last public space for unfettered music criticism in an increasingly anti-critical landscape", according to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine's Larry Fitzmaurice in 2016. In an essay on the critical response, he said they have been "the Most Hated and Loved Band in the World" and described "as underrated ''and'' overhyped, although the needle has far more often swung towards the former direction".<ref name="Fitzmaurice">{{cite magazine|last=Fitzmaurice|first=Larry|date=9 March 2016|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/6vgny8/the-1975-i-like-it-when-you-sleep-for-you-are-so-beautiful-yet-so-unaware-of-it-essay|title=The Curious Case of The 1975, the Most Hated and Loved Band in the World|magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=3 January 2019}}</ref> In Fitzmaurice's opinion, the band's debut album was mainly a straightforward rock album recorded "with a soft-focus and especially British sensibility", while ''I Like It When You Sleep'' was only rock music in the loosest sense of the word. Overall, he said their music is pop "in the realm of Alternative", most comparable to [[INXS]].<ref name="Fitzmaurice"/>
