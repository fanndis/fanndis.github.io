"'''This Is What You Came For'''" is a song by [[Calvin Harris]] featuring vocals from [[Barbadians|Barbadian]] singer [[Rihanna]]. It was released on 29 April 2016, through [[Columbia Records]] and Westbury Road. The song was written by Harris and American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], who was initially credited with the [[pseudonym]] Nils Sjöberg. Rihanna and Harris had previously collaborated on her sixth studio album, ''[[Talk That Talk]]'', which included the international chart-topper "[[We Found Love]]" and US top five single "[[Where Have You Been]]", the former of which was written and produced by Harris. He played the final version for Rihanna at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|2016 Coachella Music Festival]]. It was also played at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final]] after the conclusion of the match.

The single debuted at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Rihanna's 21st top-five song and Harris's second; the song is currently Harris's highest peaking single as a lead artist. It became Rihanna's 25th and Harris's fourth chart-topper on the [[Dance Club Songs]] and also reached number one on the US [[Hot Dance/Electronic Songs]]; the single became the 12th number one for Rihanna and Harris's tenth on the sister chart [[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]]. It topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and the Republic of Ireland and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland.

"This Is What You Came For" received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the catchiness while others regarded it boring and found Rihanna's vocals to be overprocessed. A music video for the song premiered on 17 June 2016 and features Rihanna in an open cube with images projected on the inside walls.

[[Calvin Harris]] presented the final recording to Rihanna, two weeks prior to its release. During his performance at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], Harris shared the song with Rihanna and her manager in her trailer. Harris stated that he was "nervous" to play her the song because he had "changed so many bits from when she first heard it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/760855/rihanna-and-calvin-harris-debut-new-song-admits-he-was-nervous-about-it|title=Calvin Harris Debuts New Song This Is What You Came For With Rihanna, Admits He Was Nervous About It|publisher=[[E!

{{Quote|text=I think, when a pseudonym comes in is when you still have a love for making the work and you don’t want the work to become overshadowed by this thing that’s been built around you, based on what people know about you. And that's when it's really fun to create fake names and write under them. I wrote under the name Nils Sjöberg because those are two of the most popular names of Swedish males.

Harris and Nils Sjöberg were credited as the songwriters and producers. On 13 July 2016, [[TMZ]] reported that the track was written by American singer-songwriter and Harris's then-girlfriend [[Taylor Swift]], who used the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg because they did not want their relationship to overshadow the song.<ref name="tmz">{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2016/07/13/taylor-swift-calvin-harris-this-is-what-you-came-for-wrote-song-rihanna/|title=Taylor Swift Secretly Wrote 'This is What You Came For' and Calvin 'Disrespected' Her|publisher=[[TMZ]]|date=13 July 2016|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/taylor-swift-wrote-calvin-harris-this-is-what-you-came-for|title=Taylor Swift Wrote Ex Calvin Harris and Rihanna's Hit 'This Is What You Came For,' Her Rep Confirms|accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref> The track became a point of contention upon its release, when Harris—in response to being asked about the possibility of collaborating with Swift during an interview with [[Ryan Seacrest]]—said that he "can't see it happening."<ref name="tmz"/> Harris also took to his Twitter account to confirm that Swift wrote the lyrics and contributed some vocals, while he "wrote the music, produced the song, arranged it and cut the vocals", and also confirming her previous request for secrecy as co-writer.<ref name="Nils">{{cite web |last=Strauss |first=Matthew |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/66776-taylor-swift-secretly-co-wrote-calvin-harris-and-rihannas-this-is-what-you-came-for/ |title=Taylor Swift Secretly Co-Wrote Calvin Harris and Rihanna's "This Is What You Came For" |publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=13 July 2016 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref> The credit has since been officially changed to "Taylor Swift" in [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]]'s and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]'s entry for the song.<ref name="bmi">{{cite web |url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=22013302&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID |title=BMI Repertoire: This Is What You Came For |publisher=[[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] |accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="ASCAP">{{cite web |url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/workID/891676165 |title=ACE Repertory: This Is What You Came For |publisher=[[American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] |accessdate=5 October 2016}}</ref>

==Composition==
"This Is What You Came For" is an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] song.<ref name="billboard.com"/> Gil Kaufman of ''Billboard'' stated that the song is "a chilled-out, joyful club track that nods to classic [[Chicago house]] from the late 1980s and early 1990s, but with a modern, poppier flavor."<ref name="billboard.com"/> The song is written in the key of [[C major]] with a [[tempo]] of 124 beats per minute. The song follows a chord progression of Am–F<small>maj7</small>–G–C, and Rihanna's vocals span from G<sub>3</sub> to E<sub>5</sub>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0163562|title=Calvin Harris feat.

==Music video==
The official music video for the song directed by [[Emil Nava]] with Director of Photography Martin Coppen and edited by Ellie Johnson, was released to [[YouTube]] on 16 June 2016. In it, a giant white box is shown sitting in a variety of places, such as a misty field and a forest. The scene then cuts to Rihanna, dressed in a sparkly blue jumpsuit, singing while standing and dancing inside the box. While she performs, graphics are projected onto all 5 sides around her. Lasers were the only other effects used with the video projections, and were provided by Dynamic FX. These include a variety of video effects and designs, footage of a crowd partying and running horses, and a drawing of a mountain with lightning over it. The video technology used for projections blended all angles of the backing video, so it would be displayed without skewing the image and allowing it to play back in a 3D environment. This new technology was being used for the first time on this video. This video also had many scenes and different cube designs cut from it, as the filming was cut short due to time constrains. Calvin Harris makes a brief cameo appearance in the video, driving a sports car ([[Lamborghini Aventador]]).<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOkQ4T5WO9E|title=Calvin Harris – This Is What You Came For (Official Video) ft.

Two months after its release, the video reached 500 million views, and on 29 November 2016, the video reached one billion views. As of June 2020, it has reached 2.3 billion views, and is [[List of most-viewed YouTube videos|the site's 35th most viewed video]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 1000 Most Viewed YouTube Videos of All Time|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11E57E1166929B60 |publisher=YouTube|accessdate=February 24, 2020}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
"This Is What You Came For" received mixed reviews. Lary Barleet from ''[[NME]]'' stated that "As it builds to a climax, he pulls it right back, eschewing the [[EDM drop]] in favour of voguish and mellow [[tropical house]]. It will definitely be a hit, however by manipulating her voice so much he's stripped away the personality that made "[[We Found Love]]" such a standout, and her latest album ''[[Anti (album)|Anti]]'' so compelling. The result is surprisingly soulless."<ref name= "nme.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/calvin-harris-rihannas-this-is-what-you-came-for-track-review|title=Track Review: Calvin Harris & Rihanna's 'This Is What You Came For' Is No 'We Found Love'|work=NME}}</ref> Robbie Daw from the [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] gave the song a positive review, stating, "The song is pretty decent Euro-centric dance floor fodder. It's just a bit subdued-which might have been the correct decision; why attempt to top a pop classic and fail when you can zig left, aiming for other territory altogether?"<ref name= "idolator.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7631772/pop-perspective-calvin-harris-rihanna-this-is-what-you-came-for-review|title=Pop Perspective: Calvin Harris & Rihanna's "This Is What You Came For" Rated And Reviewed|work=Idolator}}</ref>
