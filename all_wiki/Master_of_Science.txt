A '''Master of Science''' ({{lang-la|Magister Scientiae}}; abbreviated '''MS''', '''M.S.''', '''MSc''', '''M.Sc.''', '''SM''', '''S.M.''', '''ScM''' or '''Sc.M.''') is a [[master's degree]] in the field of science awarded by [[University|universities]] in many countries or a person holding such a degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/master_of_science|title=Master of Science|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries}}</ref> In contrast to the [[Master of Arts]] degree, the Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences, engineering and medicine and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences. While it ultimately depends upon the specific program, earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a [[thesis]].

==Algeria==
Algeria follows the [[Bologna Process]].

==Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Colombia, Panamá, Perú, Uruguay and Venezuela==
In [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Panamá]], [[Perú]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]], the Master of Science or Magister is a postgraduate degree of two to four years of duration.<ref>{{cite web

  }}</ref> The admission to a Master's program (Spanish: ''[[Maestría]]''; Portuguese: ''Mestrado'') requires the full completion of a four to five years long [[undergraduate degree]], [[bachelor's degree]], [[Engineer's degree]] or a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]]'s degree of the same length. Defense of a research thesis is required. All master's degrees qualify for a doctorate program.

==Australia==
Australian universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 1–2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Bangladesh==
All [[Bangladeshi]] private and public universities have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degree. These include most of the major [[State ownership|state-owned]] colleges. A number of private colleges also do offer MS degrees. After passing [[Bachelor of Science]], any student becomes eligible to study in this discipline.

==Canada==
In Canada, Master of Science (MSc) degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a mixture. Master's programs typically take one to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required. Admission to a master's program is contingent upon holding a four-year university bachelor's degree. Some universities require a master's degree in order to progress to a doctoral program (PhD).

===Quebec===
In the province of Quebec, the Master of Science follows the same principles as in the rest of Canada. There is one exception, however, regarding admission to a master's program. Since Québécois students complete two to three years of [[College education in Quebec|college]] before entering university, they have the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Some undergraduate degrees such as the [[Bachelor of Education]] and the [[Bachelor of Engineering]] requires four years of study. Following the obtention of their bachelor's degree, students can be admitted into a graduate program to eventually obtain a [[master's degree]].

While some students complete their master's program, others use it as a bridge to doctoral research programs. After one year of study and research in the master's program, many students become eligible to apply to a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) program directly, without obtaining the Master of Science degree in the first place.

==Chile==
Commonly the Chilean universities have used "Magíster" for a [[master degree]], but other than that is similar to the rest of South America.

==Cyprus, Republic of==
Like all EU member states, the Republic of Cyprus follow the Bologna Process. Universities in Cyprus have used either "Magíster Scientiae or Artium" or Master of Art/Science for a master's degree with 90 to 120 ECTS and duration of studies between 1, 2 and 5 years.

==Czech Republic, Slovakia==
Like all EU member states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia follow the Bologna Process. The Czech Republic and Slovakia are using two master's degree systems. Both award a title of ''Mgr.'' or ''Ing.'' to be used before the name.
The older system requires a 5-year program. The new system takes only 2 years but requires a previously completed 3-year bachelor program (a ''Bc.'' title). It is required to write a thesis (in both master and bachelor program) and also to pass final exams. It is mostly the case that the final exams cover the main study areas of the whole study program, i.e. a student is required to prove his/her knowledge in many subjects he attended during the 2 resp. 3 years.

==Egypt==
The Master of Science (M.Sc.) is an academic degree for a post-graduate candidates or researchers, it usually takes from 4 to 7 years after passing the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree. Master programs are awarded in many sciences in the [[Egyptian Universities]]. A completion of the degree requires finishing a [[pre-master]] studies followed by a scientific [[thesis]] or [[research]]. All M.Sc. degree holders are allowable to take a step forward in the academic track to get the [[PhD]] degree.

==Finland==
Like all EU member states, Finland follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree usually follows the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) studies which typically last five years. For the completion of both the bachelor and the master studies the student must accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Germany==
Like all EU member states, Germany follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) in neuroscience in [[University of Bonn]],  academic degree replaces the once common ''[[Diplom]]'' or ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' programs that typically lasted four to five years. It is awarded in science related studies with a high percentage of mathematics. For the completion the student must accumulate 300 ECTS Credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Southeastern Europe==
In Slavic countries in European southeast (particularly former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] republics), the education system was largely based on the German university system (largely due to the presence and influence of the [[Austria-Hungary Empire]]<ref name=":0" /> in the region). Prior to the implementation of the [[Bologna Process]], academic university studies comprised a 4-5 year long graduate ''[[Diplom]]'' program, which could have been followed by a 2-4 year long ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' program and then later with 2-4 year long ''[[Doctoral studies]]''.

After the Bologna Process implementation, again based on the German implementation, ''Diplom'' titles and programs were replaced by the M.Sc. and M.A. programs (depending on the field of study). The studies are structured such that a ''Master'' program lasts long enough for the student to accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, so its duration would depend on a number of credits acquired during the Bachelor studies. Pre-Bologna ''Magister'' programs were abandoned - after earning an M.Sc/M.A. degree and satisfying other academic requirements a student could proceed to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree directly.

==Guyana==
In Guyana, all universities, including [[University of Guyana]], [[Texila American University]], [[American International School of Medicine]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. Students who have completed undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree are eligible to study in this discipline.

==India==
In India, universities offer MS programs usually in sciences discipline. Generally, post-graduate scientific courses lead to MS degree while post-graduate engineering courses lead to ME or MTech degree. For example, a master's in automotive engineering would normally be an ME or MTech, while a master's in physics would be an MS. A few top universities also offer undergraduate programs leading to a master's degree which is known as integrated masters.

A Master of Science in Engineering (MS.Engg.) degree is also offered in India. It is usually structured as an engineering research degree, lesser than [[PhD]] and considered to be parallel to [[M.Phil.]] degree in humanities and science. Some institutes such as [[IITs]] offer an MS degree for postgraduate engineering courses. This degree is considered a research-oriented degree whereas MTech or ME degree is usually not a research degree in India. MS degree is also awarded by various [[IISER]]s which are one of the top institutes in India.

==Iran==
In Iran, similar to Canada, Master of Science (MSc) or in Iranian form ''Karshenasi-arshad'' degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or most commonly a mixture. Master's programs typically take two to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required.

==Ireland==
Like all EU member states, Ireland follows the Bologna Process. In Ireland, Master of Science (MSc) may be course-based with a research component or entirely research based. The program is most commonly a one-year program and a thesis is required for both course-based and research based degrees.

==Israel==
In Israel, Master of Science (MSc) may be entirely course-based or include research. The program is most commonly a two-year program and a thesis is required only for research based degrees.

==Italy==
Like all EU member states, Italy follows the Bologna Process. The degree ''Master of Science'' is awarded in the Italian form, ''[[Laurea Magistrale]]'' (formerly ''Laurea specialistica''; before the introduction of the ''Laurea'' the corresponding degree was ''[[Laurea]] quinquennale'' or ''Vecchio Ordinamento'').

==Nepal==
In Nepal, universities offer the master of science degree usually in science and engineering areas. [[Tribhuvan University]] offers MSc degree for all the science and engineering courses. [[Pokhara University]] offers ME for engineering and MSc for science. [[Kathmandu University]] offers MS by Research and ME degrees for science and engineering.

==Netherlands==
Like all EU member states, the Netherlands follows the Bologna Process. However, a graduate who is awarded the title Master of Science (abbreviated as MSc) may only use the previously awarded Dutch titles if the degree is awarded by a research university, noticeably excluding the HBO Master<ref>https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/vraag-en-antwoord/welke-titel-mag-ik-voeren-als-ik-ben-afgestudeerd-of-gepromoveerd</ref>. 
* ''ingenieur'' (abbreviated as ir.)(for graduates who followed a technical or agricultural program)
* ''meester'' (abbreviated as mr.) (for graduates who followed an LLM law program)
* ''doctorandus'' (abbreviated as drs.)(in all other cases).

==New Zealand==
New Zealand universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Norway==
Norway follows the Bologna Process. For engineering, the Master of Science academic degree has been recently introduced and has replaced the previous award forms "[[Sivilingeniør]]" (engineer, a.k.a. engineering master) and "Hovedfag" (academic master). Both were awarded after 5 years of university-level studies and required the completion of a scientific thesis.

"Siv.ing", is a protected title exclusively awarded to engineering students who completed a five-year education at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology ({{lang-no|Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet}}, NTNU) or other universities. Historically there was no bachelor's degree involved and today's program is a five years master's degree education. The "Siv.ing" title is in the process of being phased out, replaced by (for now, complemented by) the "M.Sc." title. By and large, "Siv.ing" is a title tightly being held on to for the sake of tradition. In academia, the new program offers separate three-year bachelor and two-year master programs. It is awarded in the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science fields. The completion of a scientific thesis is required. All master's degrees are designed to certify a level of education and qualify for a doctorate program.

Master of Science in Business is the English title for those taking a higher business degree, "Siviløkonom" in Norwegian. In addition, there is, for example, the 'Master of Business Administration' (MBA), a practically oriented master's degree in business, but with less mathematics and econometrics, due to its less specific entry requirements and smaller focus on research.

==Pakistan==
Pakistan inherited its conventions pertaining to higher education from [[United Kingdom]] after [[Partition of India|independence in 1947]]. Master of Science degree is typically abbreviated as M.Sc. (as in the United Kingdom) and which is awarded after 16 years of education (equivalent with a bachelor's degree in the US and many other countries). Recently, in pursuance to some of the reforms by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (the regulatory body of higher education in Pakistan), the traditional 2-year Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree has been replaced by the 4-year Bachelor of Science degree, which is abbreviated as B.S. to enable the Pakistani degrees with the rest of the world.{{Clarify|reason=What is meant here by enable the Pakistani degrees with the rest of the world? To put on par with? To make it more relatable in terms of experience? The word choice makes it unclear|date=November 2019}} Subsequently, students who pass a 4-year B.S. degree that is awarded after 16 years of education are then eligible to apply for M.S. degree, which is considered at par with Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) degree.{{Clarify|reason=Is the comparison being drawn to a general, worldwide concept of M.Phil or one particular to Pakistan? It is unclear|date=November 2019}}

==Poland==
Like all EU member states, Poland follows the Bologna Process. The Polish equivalent of Master of Science is "magister" (abbreviated "mgr", written pre-nominally much like "Dr"). Starting in 2001, the MSc programs typically lasting 5 years began to be replaced as below:
* 3-year associates programs, ([[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate degree]] termed "licencjat" in Polish. No abbreviated pre-nominal or title.)
* 3.5-year engineer programs (termed "inżynier", utilizing the pre-nominal abbreviation "inż.")
* 2-year master programs open to both "licencjat" and "inż." graduates.
* 1.5-year master programs open only to "inż." graduates.
The degree is awarded predominantly in the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, economics, as well as in the arts and other disciplines. Those who graduate from an engineering program prior to being awarded a master's degree are allowed to use the "mgr inż." pre-nominal ("master engineer"). This is most common in engineering and agricultural fields of study. Defense of a research [[thesis]] is required. All master's degrees in Poland qualify for a [[doctorate]] program.

==Russia==
The title of "master" was introduced by Alexander I at 24 January 1803. The Master had an intermediate position between the candidate and doctor according to the decree "About colleges structure". The master's degree was abolished from 1917 to 1934. Russia follows the [[Bologna Process]] for higher education in Europe since 2011.

==Spain==
Like all EU member states, Spain follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (MSc) degree is a program officially recognized by the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Education]]. It usually involves 1 or 2 years of full-time study. It is targeted at pre-experience candidates who have recently finished their undergraduate studies. An MSc degree can be awarded in every field of study. An MSc degree is required in order to progress to a PhD. MSci, MPhil and DEA are equivalent in Spain.

==Sweden==
Like all EU member states, Sweden follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science academic degree has, like in Germany, recently been introduced in Sweden. Students studying Master of Science in Engineering programs are rewarded both the English Master of Science Degree, but also the Swedish equivalent "Teknologisk masterexamen". Whilst "Civilingenjör" is an at least five year long education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kth.se/utbildning/civilingenjor/datateknik|title=Datateknik, civilingenjör 300 hp|publisher=[[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]]|language=sv}}</ref>

==Syria==
The Master of Science is a degree that can be studied only in public universities. The program is usually 2 years, but it can be extended to 3 or 4 years. The student is required to pass a specific bachelor's degree to attend a specific master of science degree program. The master of science is mostly a research degree, except for some types of programs held with cooperation of foreign universities. The student typically attends courses in the first year of the program and should then prepare a research thesis. Publishing two research papers is recommended and will increase the final evaluation grade.{{According to whom|date=November 2019}}

==United Kingdom==
The Master of Science (MSc) is typically a taught postgraduate degree, involving lectures, examinations and a project dissertation (normally taking up a third of the program). Master's programs usually involve a minimum of 1 year of full-time study (180 UK credits, of which 150 must be at master's level) and sometimes up to 2 years of full-time study (or the equivalent period part-time).<ref name="QAA master's">{{cite web|title=Master's Degree Characteristics Statement |publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2977#.WK59n38WI2g|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=September 2015}}</ref> Taught master's degrees are normally classified into Pass, Merit and Distinction (although some universities do not give Merit).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/msc_degree_classification/|title=MSc Classification|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> Some universities also offer MSc by research programs, where a longer project or set of projects is undertaken full-time; master's degrees by research are normally pass/fail, although some universities may offer a distinction.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|title=Masters Degree Grades|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-research-mathematics?wssl=1|title=MSc by Research in Mathematics|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>

The more recent Master ''in'' Science (MSci or M.Sci.) degree (Master of Natural Science at the [[University of Cambridge]]), is an undergraduate (UG) level integrated master's degree offered by UK institutions since the 1990s. It is offered as a first degree with the first three (four in Scotland) years similar to a BSc course and a final year (120 UK credits) at master's level, including a dissertation.<ref name="QAA master's"/><ref name="FHEQ">{{cite web|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2843#.WK5-J38WI2g|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013061809/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2843#.WK5-J38WI2g|archive-date=13 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The final MSci qualification is thus at the same level as a traditional MSc.

==United States==
The ''Master of Science'' (''Magister Scientiæ'') degree is normally a full-time two-year degree often abbreviated "MS" or "M.S." It is the primary type in most subjects and may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a combination of the two. The combination often involves writing and defending a thesis or completing a research project which represents the culmination of the material learned.

Admission to a master's program is normally contingent upon holding a [[bachelor's degree]] and progressing to a [[doctorate|doctoral]] program may require a master's degree. In some fields or graduate programs, work on a doctorate can begin immediately after the bachelor's degree. Some programs provide for a joint bachelor's and master's degree after about five years. Some universities use the Latin degree names and due to the flexibility of [[Latin grammar|word order in Latin]], ''Artium Magister'' (A.M.) or ''Scientiæ Magister'' (S.M. or Sc.M.) may be used in some institutions.
