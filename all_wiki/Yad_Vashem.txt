'''Yad Vashem''' ({{lang-he-n|יָד וַשֵׁם}}; literally, "a monument and a name") is [[Israel]]'s official memorial to the victims of the [[Holocaust]]. It is dedicated to preserving the memory of the dead; honoring Jews who fought against their [[Nazi]] oppressors and [[Gentile]]s who selflessly aided Jews in need; and researching the phenomenon of the Holocaust in particular and [[genocide]] in general, with the aim of avoiding such events in the future.

Established in 1953, Yad Vashem is on the western slope of [[Mount Herzl]], also known as the Mount of Remembrance, a height in western [[Jerusalem]], {{convert|804|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and adjacent to the [[Jerusalem Forest]]. The memorial consists of a {{convert |180|dunam|ha acre|adj=on|sigfig= 3}} complex containing two types of facilities: some dedicated to the scientific study of the Holocaust and genocide in general, and memorials and museums catering to the needs of the larger public. Among the former there are a research institute with archives, a library, a publishing house, and an educational center, and the International School/Institute for Holocaust Studies; among the latter, the Holocaust History Museum, memorial sites such as the [[Monument to the children in Yad Vashem|Children's Memorial]] and the Hall of Remembrance, the Museum of Holocaust Art, sculptures, outdoor commemorative sites such as the Valley of the Communities, and a synagogue.

A core goal of Yad Vashem's founders was to recognize non-Jews who, at personal risk and without a financial or evangelistic motive, chose to save Jews from the ongoing genocide during the Holocaust. Those recognized by Israel as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] are honored in a section of Yad Vashem known as the [[Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations]].

Yad Vashem is the second-most-visited Israeli tourist site, after the [[Western Wall]], with approximately one million visitors each year. It charges no admission fee.

==Etymology==
The name "Yad Vashem" is taken from a verse in the [[Book of Isaiah]]:
"[To] them will I give in my house and within my walls a [place] and a [name], better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting [name], that shall not be cut off [from memory]."
<ref>{{cite book |title=The Holy Scriptures: A New Translation |date=1917 |publisher=Jewish Publication Society |url=https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.56.5?ven=The_Holy_Scriptures:_A_New_Translation_(JPS_1917)&lang=bi.}}</ref><ref>Emendations based on Ibn Ezra and Metzudat David, as quoted by sefaria.org.</ref> {{lang-he|וְנָתַתִּי לָהֶם בְּבֵיתִי וּבְחוֹמֹתַי '''יָד וָשֵׁם''', טוֹב מִבָּנִים וּמִבָּנוֹת; שֵׁם עוֹלָם אֶתֶּן לוֹ, אֲשֶׁר לֹא יִכָּרֵת.}}). Naming the Holocaust memorial "yad vashem" ({{lang-he|יָד וָשֵׁם}}, ''yād wā-šêm'', literally "a memorial and a name") conveys the idea of establishing a national depository for the names of Jewish victims who have no one to carry their name after death. The original verse referred to [[eunuch]]s who, although they could not have children, could still live for eternity with the Lord.<ref name="The Ethics of Memory">{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=HHG5mRuVXN4C |page=22 }} |title=The Ethics of Memory |first=Avishai |last=Margalit |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2002 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:ISR-2015-Jerusalem-Yad Vashem-Wagon monument 01.jpg|thumb|The wagon (or ''[[Stock car (rail)|cattle car]]'') monument in memory of the [[Holocaust trains]]]]

The notion of establishing a memorial in the historical [[Jewish homeland]] for Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust was conceived during [[World War II]], as a response to reports of the mass murder of Jews in Nazi-occupied countries. Yad Vashem was first proposed in September 1942, at a board meeting of the [[Jewish National Fund]], by Mordecai Shenhavi, a member of Kibbutz [[Mishmar Ha'emek]].<ref name="The Ethics of Memory"/> In August 1945, the plan was discussed in greater detail at a [[Zionist]] meeting in London. A provisional board of Zionist leaders was established that included [[David Remez]] as chairman, [[Shlomo Zalman Shragai]], [[Baruch Zuckerman]], and Shenhavi. In February 1946, Yad Vashem opened an office in Jerusalem and a branch office in [[Tel Aviv]], and in June that year convened its first plenary session. In July 1947, the First Conference on Holocaust Research was held at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. However, the outbreak of the [[1947–1949 Palestine war]] brought operations to a standstill for two years.

On 19 August 1953, the [[Knesset]], Israel's Parliament, unanimously passed the Yad Vashem Law, establishing the Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority, the aim of which was "the commemoration in the Homeland of all those members of the Jewish people who gave their lives, or rose up and fought the Nazi enemy and its collaborators," and to set up "a memorial to them, and to the communities, organizations and institutions that were destroyed because they belonged to the Jewish people."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Martin |authorlink1= Martin Gilbert|title=Israel: A History |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Perennial |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-68812363-5|page=288|edition= rev. & upd.}}</ref>

On 29 July 1954, the cornerstone for the Yad Vashem building was laid on a hill in western Jerusalem, to be known as the Mount of Remembrance ({{lang-he|Har HaZikaron}}); the organization had already begun projects to [[Page of Testimony|collect the names of individuals killed in the Holocaust]]; acquire Holocaust documentation and personal testimonies of survivors for the Archives and Library; and develop research and publications.

The location of Yad Vashem on the western side of [[Mount Herzl]], an area devoid of weighty historical associations, was chosen to convey a symbolic message of "rebirth" after destruction, distinct from the [[Chamber of the Holocaust]], founded in 1948 on [[Mount Zion]].<ref>{{cite book|title=On Memory: An Interdisciplinary Approach |url= {{Google books |plainurl= yes |id= zBE_q09a5mgC |page= 43}} |first= Arye |last= Edrei|chapter=Holocaust Memorial|editor= Doron Mendels |page=43|isbn=978-3-03911-064-3 |date= 2007-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal= Shiur Times |date=May 6, 2008|pages=36–37 |url= https://issuu.com/shiurtimes/docs/may2008 |first= Yehudit |last= Singer|title=60 Years of Commemorating the Holocaust}}</ref> Thus, the latter museum, whose walls are lined with plaques memorializing over 2,000 Jewish communities destroyed during the Holocaust,<ref name= "sallyann">{{cite book |url= {{Google books |plainurl= yes |id=fG8WAQAAIAAJ }} |title=A guide to Jewish genealogical research in Israel |page= 67 |first= Sallyann |last= Amdur Sack | authorlink = Sallyann Amdur Sack |year=1995 |publisher=[[Avotaynu]] |isbn= 0-96263737-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl= yes |id=TRc9ea_CKOUC |page=371 }} |title= Israel and the Palestinian Territories: The Rough Guide |page= 371 |first1=Daniel |last1= Jacobs |first2= Shirley |last2= Eber |first3=Francesca |last3= Silvani |year= 1998 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=1-85828248-9}}</ref> portrays the Holocaust as a continuation of the "death and destruction" that plagued Jewish communities throughout Jewish history.<ref>{{cite book |url= {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=FOckAQAAMAAJ |page= 99}} |page= 99 |title=The Holocaust in Israeli Public Debate in the 1950s: Ideology and memory |year=2007 |publisher= Vallentine Mitchell |first=Roni |last=Stauber |isbn= 0-85303723-X}}</ref>

On 15 March 2005, a new Museum complex four times larger than the old one opened at Yad Vashem. It included the Holocaust History Museum with a new [[Hall of Names]], a Museum of Holocaust Art, an Exhibitions Pavilion, a Learning Center and a Visual Center.<ref>{{cite news |title= New Holocaust Museum Opens in Jerusalem |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/15/international/middleeast/new-holocaus-holocaust-museum-opens-in-jerusalem.html |accessdate=15 January 2018 |work= The New York Times|date= March 15, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= The new Holocaust History Museum at Yad Vashem – Facts & Figures|url= http://www.yadvashem.org/press-release/15-march-2005-12-04.html |publisher=Yad Vashem | type = press release |date= 15 March 2005}}</ref>

The institution's policy is that the Holocaust "cannot be compared to any other event".

''Yad Vashem Studies'' is a peer-reviewed semi-annual scholarly journal on the Holocaust.

Yad Vashem opened to the public in 1957. Its exhibits focused on Jewish resistance in the [[Warsaw ghetto]], the uprisings in [[Sobibor]] and [[Treblinka]] [[death camps]], and the struggle of survivors to reach Israel.<ref name="This is ours and ours alone">{{cite news|author=Chris McGreal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/mar/15/heritage.israelandthepalestinians |title='This is ours and ours alone' |newspaper=Guardian |date=2005-03-15 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}</ref>

In 1993, planning began for a larger, more technologically advanced museum to replace the old one. The new building, designed by Canadian-Israeli architect [[Moshe Safdie]], consists of a long corridor connected to 10 exhibition halls, each dedicated to a different chapter of the Holocaust. The museum combines the personal stories of 90 Holocaust victims and survivors, and presents approximately 2,500 personal items including artwork and letters donated by survivors and others. The old historical displays revolving around [[anti-Semitism]] and the rise of [[Nazism]] have been replaced by exhibits that focus on the personal stories of Jews killed in the Holocaust. According to Avner Shalev, the museum's curator and chairman, a visit to the new museum revolves around "looking into the eyes of the individuals. There weren't six million victims, there were six million individual murders."<ref name="This is ours and ours alone"/>

The new museum was dedicated on 15 March 2005 in the presence of leaders from 40 states and former [[Secretary General]] of the [[UN]] [[Kofi Annan]]. [[President of Israel]] [[Moshe Katzav]] said that Yad Vashem serves as "an important signpost to all of humankind, a signpost that warns how short the distance is between hatred and murder, between racism and genocide".<ref>Kofi Annan commented at the opening, "The number of Holocaust survivors who are still with us is dwindling fast. Our children are growing up just as rapidly. They are beginning to ask their first questions about injustice. What will we tell them? Will we say, 'That's just the way the world is'? Or will we say instead, 'We are trying to change things—to find a better way'? Let this museum stand as a testimony that we are striving for a better way. Let Yad Vashem inspire us to keep striving, as long as the darkest dark stalks the face of the earth."

The first architect involved in the design of Yad Vashem was [[Munio Weinraub]], who worked on the project from 1943 till the 1960s, together with his architectural partner Al Mansfield.<ref name="1942plan"/> He was approached for this purpose by [[Mordechai Shenhavi]], the initiator and first director of the institution.<ref name="1942plan"/> Weinraub's plans were not realised as a whole, but some of his ideas are visible in Yad Vashem today.<ref name="1942plan">{{cite news |author= Esther Zandberg |title= Holocaust Memorial Yad Vashem Was Already Being Planned in 1942 |date= 31 Jan 2014 |newspaper= Haaretz |url= https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/.premium-plan-for-yad-vashem-already-drafted-1942-1.5317288 |access-date=20 December 2019}}</ref>

The new Holocaust History Museum, designed by [[Moshe Safdie]], is shaped like a triangular concrete [[prism]] that cuts through the landscape, illuminated by a {{convert|200|m|ft|0|sp=us}}-long skylight. Visitors follow a preset route that takes them through underground galleries that branch off from the main hall.<ref name="highbeam.com"/> Safdie is also the architect behind the [[Monument to the children in Yad Vashem|Children's Memorial]] and the Deportees (cattle-car) Memorial.

The gates are the work of the sculptor [[David Palombo]] (1920–1966).

==Hall of Names==
{{main|Hall of Names}}
[[File:Hall of Names.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Names containing Pages of Testimony commemorating the millions of Jews who were murdered during the [[Holocaust]]]]

The Hall of Names is a memorial to the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust. The main hall is composed of two cones: one ten meters high, with a reciprocal well-like cone excavated into the underground rock, its base filled with water. On the upper cone is a display featuring 600 photographs of Holocaust victims and fragments of Pages of Testimony. These are reflected in the water at the bottom of the lower cone, commemorating those victims whose names remain unknown. Surrounding the platform is the circular repository, housing the approximately 2.2 million Pages of Testimony collected to date, with empty spaces for those yet to be submitted.

Since the 1950s, Yad Vashem has collected approximately 110,000 audio, video, and written testimonies by Holocaust survivors. As the survivors age, the program has expanded to visiting survivors in their homes, to tape interviews. Adjoining the hall is a study area with a computerized data bank where visitors can do online searches for the names of Holocaust victims.

==Archives==
The Archive is the oldest department of Yad Vashem. Before presenting an exhibition, Yad Vashem collects items. The best known of these are the historical photographs, as well as the Pages of Testimonies collected from survivors. The latter is a database of personal information about those who survived and those who perished in the Holocaust. Yad Vashem has also acquired access to the database of the [[International Tracing Service]] of Bad Arolsen of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], and these two databases complement each other for research purposes.

One of Yad Vashem's tasks is to honor non-Jews who risked their lives, liberty, or positions to save Jews during the Holocaust. To this end, a special independent commission, headed by a retired Supreme Court justice, was established. The commission members, including historians, public figures, lawyers, and Holocaust survivors, examine and evaluate each case according to a well-defined set of criteria and regulations. The Righteous receive a certificate of honor and a medal, and their names are commemorated in the [[Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gariwo.net/eng_new/foreste/yadvashem.php |title=Gardens of the Righteous Worldwide - The Yad Vashem Garden of the Righteous |publisher=Gariwo |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}</ref> on the Mount of Remembrance, Yad Vashem. This is an ongoing project that will continue for as long as there are valid requests, substantiated by testimonies or documentation. Five hundred and fifty-five individuals were recognized during 2011, and {{As of|2019|lc=y}}, more than 26,973 individuals have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations.<ref>[https://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/statistics.html Total of Righteous by country dd. 1st Jan. 2019] ''Yad Vashem''</ref>

Yad Vashem's declared policy is not to provide meaningful recognition, even in a possible new category, to Jews who rescued Jews, regardless of the number of people their activism saved. The stated reason is that Jews had an obligation to save fellow Jews and do not deserve recognition.<ref>https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Why-wont-Yad-Vashem-honor-Jewish-rescuers - by Dr. Mordecai Paldiel who directed the Yad Vashem ''Righteous'' department for decades</ref><ref>https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Yad-Vashem-and-Jewish-rescuers-of-Jews-472621 - by Dr. Mordecai Paldiel</ref>
