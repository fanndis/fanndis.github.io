"'''Back to Black'''" is a song by English singer and songwriter [[Amy Winehouse]] from her second and final studio album [[Back to Black|of the same name]] (2006). It was released by [[Island Records]] on 30 April 2007 as the album's third single. The song was written by Winehouse and [[Mark Ronson]], and produced by the latter. "Back to Black" was inspired by Winehouse's relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil, who had left her for an ex-girlfriend.

"Back to Black" received universal acclaim by [[music journalism|music critics]], who generally praised its throwback sound to [[girl group]]s from the 1960s. It was included on several compiled year and decade-end lists of the best in music and was further considered to be one of Winehouse's [[signature song]]s. The single peaked at number eight on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the United Kingdom and is Winehouse's third best-selling single in that country. Many cover versions by various artists were recorded for the song; most notably, [[Beyoncé]] and [[André 3000]] covered it for the [[The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film|soundtrack]] of the [[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|2013 film adaptation]] of the novel ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925).

A [[documentary film]] based on the life and death of Winehouse, ''[[Amy (2015 film)|Amy]]'' (2015) features a videoed tape of Winehouse recording the song with [[Mark Ronson]], in March 2006 and an a cappella melody was featured on the [[Amy (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack]].

==Background and composition==
"Back to Black" was written by [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Mark Ronson]] with the latter also serving as its [[record producer|producer]]. The track was recorded in three studios&nbsp;– [[Chung King Studios]] and Daptone Studios located in New York City and Metropolis Studios in London.<ref name="AV">{{cite AV media notes|title=Back to Black|others=[[Amy Winehouse]]|year=2007|publisher=[[Island Records]]}}</ref> "Back to Black" was inspired by her relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil. He had left Winehouse for an ex-girlfriend, leaving her going to "black," which to the listener may appear to refer to [[Alcoholism|drinking]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  However, the "black" to which she refers is more likely heroin, to which she was openly addicted; "black" is the second most common street name for heroin in Los Angeles.<ref>{{harvnb|Winehouse|2012|pp=68–69}}</ref>

"Back to Black" was covered by American singer [[Beyoncé]] and American rapper [[André 3000]] for the [[The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film|soundtrack]] of the 2013 film ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]''. The song premiered in April 2013 after several snippets of it appeared online and it was used in the trailer for the film. [[Jay Z]], who served as an [[executive producer]] for the soundtrack, suggested the song to its producer [[Baz Luhrmann]]. It was the final song recorded for the album and was included after the producers wanted a darker moment on ''The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film''. [[Amy Winehouse]]'s father Mitchell Winehouse reported that Beyoncé had not informed him about covering the song and requested that the income coming from it should be included in his [[Amy Winehouse Foundation]]. When the song was released, Winehouse criticized André 3000's singing saying that it should have been covered only by Beyoncé. However, [[Mark Ronson]], the original producer of the song revealed that he was flattered and honored by the cover version.
 
Beyoncé and André 3000's cover is a slower version than the original with several lyrical modifications. It features a darker production with heavier instrumentation complete with a guitar and synthesizers, [[chopped and screwed]] elements and [[Electronic music|electronic]] beats. Upon its release, the song received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]] who noted that the original version was already perfect to be further reworked; several critics praised its reworked arrangement while others criticized the singers' vocal performance calling it the most controversial song on the soundtrack.

===Background and development===
On 1 April 2013 it was announced by [[E! Online]] that American singer [[Beyoncé]] would cover the song with [[André 3000]] for ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'' [[The Great Gatsby (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], set to be released on 7 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Malkin|first=Marc|title=Beyoncé Covering Amy Winehouse for The Great Gatsby|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/403523/beyonc-covering-amy-winehouse-for-the-great-gatsby|publisher=E! News|date=1 April 2013|accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref> [[Baz Luhrmann]], the director of the film, revealed that "Back to Black" was the final song to be included on the album. The inclusion of the song on the soundtrack was suggested by Beyoncé's husband and rapper [[Jay Z]], who also served as its [[executive producer]]. "We were looking for, 'How do we have a darker moment?' and he said have a listen to this and he played it", commented Luhrmann who, after a few spins, confirmed it should appear on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1706513/beyonce-back-to-black-great-gatsby-soundtrack.jhtml|title=Beyonce's 'Back To Black' Helps Make 'The Great Gatsby' A Bit 'Darker'|publisher=MTV News|first1=Jocelyn|last1=Vena|first2=Josh|last2=Horowitz|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref> Anton Monsted who served as a producer for the soundtrack, also talked about the placement of the cover of "Back to Black" on the track listing during an interview with ''The Hollywood Reporter'':
<blockquote>
We have to thank Jay Z for bringing this into the overall thinking. He worked with us on the second party in the movie. The first party is a gaudy, rich, Venus flytrap of a celebration designed to attract Daisy's interest by physically bringing the entire city of New York to Long Island. The second party is one that Daisy does attend, but at this point in the story, we were looking for a musical direction that alluded to darker things beneath the surface. We were looking for a song that would speak to the almost '[[Sid and Nancy]]' addictive love that Gatsby and Daisy have found themselves re-engaging in. Everybody knows the Amy Winehouse version of this song, and I think this is a very interesting interpretation. It plunges you further into this particular kind of lovesickness. I think it works very well in the film, where it blends between a jazz recording that [[The Bryan Ferry Orchestra]] did and the version on the album with Beyoncé and André 3000. That combination helps to deepen the resonance of what the song is telling us.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/great-gatsby-soundtrack-track-by-track-521092|title=From Flappers to Rappers: 'The Great Gatsby' Music Supervisor Breaks Down the Film's Soundtrack|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Roy|last=Trakin|date=11 May 2013|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>

On 2 April 2013, Amy Winehouse's father Mitchell Winehouse used his [[Twitter]] profile to reveal that Beyoncé had not informed him of her plans to cover the song and that he wanted income from the song to go to his [[Amy Winehouse Foundation]]. He wrote, "I don't know about this but what if Beyoncé gave £100,000 to the foundation? Do you know how many kids that would help?

===Critical reception===
Upon its release, the collaboration of "Back to Black" received mixed reviews by music critics. Critics discussed that the song was already "perfect" to be further reworked.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10057018/Bryan-Ferry-is-the-backbone-of-The-Great-Gatsby-soundtrack.html|title=Bryan Ferry is the backbone of The Great Gatsby soundtrack|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first= Alice|last=Vincent|date=15 May 2013|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref> A writer of the website [[Consequence of Sound]] commented that the cover was "an intriguing take on the sultry number, featuring a soft pulse of dub underneath the syrupy sing-talk of André and breathy croon a la [[Marilyn Monroe]]/[[Betty Boop]] from Queen B."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/04/listen-to-beyonce-and-andre-3000-cover-amy-winehouses-back-to-black/|title=Listen to Beyoncé and André 3000 cover Amy Winehouse's "Back to Black"|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=26 April 2013}}</ref> Paula Mejía of the same website listed the song as a highlight on the album, adding that the singers "take an unsettling postmortem stab": "Oozing womps from the latter [Beyoncé] trickle into the ear slowly, mimicking that feeling when you're walking alone at night and have the suspicion you're being followed, but you're too freaked-out and cool to look behind you."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/05/album-review-music-from-baz-luhrmanns-film-the-great-gatsby/|title=Album Review: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film The Great Gatsby|magazine=Consequence of Sound|first=Paula|last=Mejia|date=9 May 2013|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> Christina Lee of the website [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] wrote in her review of the song that it was "a gloomier take on Southern hip-hop's codeine effect", comparing it with [[OutKast]]'s album ''[[Aquemini]]'' (1998) reinterpreted for contemporary times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/7455128/beyonce-andre-3000-amy-winehouse-back-to-black-cover|title=Beyonce & Andre 3000's "Back To Black": Hear The Full Track|website=Idolator|first=Christina|last=Lee|date=27 April 2013|accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref> Charley Rogulewski of ''Vibe'' magazine commented that the cover was "a drugged-out slow burner in comparison to the doo-wop original, which boasted Winehouse's robust vocals".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/new-music-beyonce-andre-3000-back-black|title=New Music: Beyonce, Andre 3000 -- "Back to Black"|work=Vibe|first=Charley|last=Rogulewski|date=27 April 2013|accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref> C.

In a more mixed review, [[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries called the song an "icy cold reading" of the original.<ref name="allmusicrev">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-great-gatsby-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0002541283|title=The Great Gatsby (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|accessdate=8 August 2013|website=AllMusic|first=David|last=Jeffries}}</ref> Nothing that it had a "lavish-yet-empty feeling", Aisha Harris from ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine wrote in her review: "The song has the feel of a blurry stupor—fitting... for the dark undertones of ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', but not terribly satisfying outside that context. Winehouse's vocals had a visceral, emotional punch, whereas here, there's little connection between the sound of the voices and the meaning of the lyrics. 'Life is like a pipe/ And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside' doesn't feel as meaningful coming from Beyoncé as it did from Winehouse."<ref name="slate" /> Thomas Conner from the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that Beyoncé surprises by downshifting into "indie-chanteuse mode" for the cover which he noted that was sung "with a sad sexual tension that approaches torch song but never ignites it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2013/05/review_the_great_gatsby_soundtrack_jay-z_beyonce.html |title=Review: 'The Great Gatsby' soundtrack |first=Thomas |last=Corner |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=5 May 2013 |accessdate=8 August 2013 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119074618/http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2013/05/review_the_great_gatsby_soundtrack_jay-z_beyonce.html |archivedate=19 January 2016 }}</ref> Newman from the website [[HitFix]] wrote in her review that the original version was stronger than the cover and added that it felt like it was a song by André 3000 featuring Beyoncé as the song mainly featured his vocals.

Mark Beech from [[Bloomberg L.P.]] gave a negative review towards the cover, writing that Beyoncé and André 3000 "murdered" the original version and noted that [[F.
