===1919–1945: Early years===

AIG was founded December 19, 1919<ref name=loc/> when American [[Cornelius Vander Starr]] (1892-1968) established a general insurance agency, American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), in Shanghai, China.<ref name="Laing">{{cite news|last=Laing|first=Jonathan R.|title=Are the Glory Years Over? – Much Slower Growth Seems in the Offing for AIG|newspaper=Barron's|date=July 8, 1991}}</ref>  Business grew rapidly, and two years later, Starr formed a life insurance operation.<ref name="BloomberBusinsssWeek">{{cite news|last=Tracer|first=Zachary|title=Benmosche Exits Greenberg Jewel Linked to AIG Founding.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-22/aig-divests-greenberg-s-asian-jewel-that-thiam-failed-to-acquire-timeline|accessdate=February 21, 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=December 18, 2012}}</ref>  By the late 1920s, AAU had branches throughout [[China]] and Southeast Asia, including the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Malaysia]].<ref name="AIG Europe – History">{{cite news|title=AIG Europe – History|newspaper=Marketline|date=February 18, 2004}}</ref>  In 1926, Starr opened his first office in the United States, American International Underwriters Corporation (AIU).<ref>{{cite news|last=Bandler|first=James|title=Hank's Last Stand|url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/26/magazines/fortune/bandler_greenberg.fortune/index.htm.|accessdate=February 21, 2013|newspaper=Fortune|date=October 7, 2008}}</ref>  He also focused on opportunities in [[Latin America]] and, in the late 1930s, AIU entered [[Havana]], Cuba.<ref>{{cite news | title=American International Group Inc (New York Stock Exchange) | url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=AIG.N | publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] | work=Company profile | location=New York| accessdate=March 18, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220123409/https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=AIG.N| archive-date=February 20, 2009 | url-status=live}}</ref> The steady growth of the Latin American agencies proved significant as it would offset the decline in business from Asia due to the impending World War II.<ref name="Laing"/> In 1939, Starr moved his headquarters from Shanghai, China, to New York City.<ref>{{cite news | title=AIG: What does this US giant do? | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7621574.stm | date=September 17, 2008 |work=BBC News | accessdate=March 18, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320013252/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7621574.stm| archive-date=March 20, 2009 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign Office Files for China, 1949–1976 |url=http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/fo_china_part_1/Publishers-Note.aspx |publisher=Adam Matthew Publications |work=Part 1: Complete Files for 1949: Publisher's Note |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013085518/http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/fo_china_part_1/Publishers-Note.aspx |archive-date=October 13, 2008 }}</ref>

===1945–1959: International and domestic expansion===

After World War II, American International Underwriters (AIU) entered Japan<ref name="Laing"/> and Germany,<ref>{{cite news|title=80 Years of Growth and Diversification; the AIG Story|newspaper=Business Insurance|date=April 12, 1999}}</ref> to provide insurance for American military personnel.

Starr's general and life insurance organization included an extensive network of agents and offices in over 75 countries.<ref name="Fallen Giant" />

===1959–1979: Reorganization and specialization===

In 1960, C.V. Starr hired [[Maurice R. Greenberg]], known as Hank, to develop an international accident and health business.<ref>{{cite news|title=Greenberg Joining C.V. Starr & Co. in Development Capacity|newspaper=Insurance Advocate|date=December 17, 1960}}</ref> Two years later, Greenberg reorganized one of C.V.

Using brokers, AIU could price insurance according to its potential return even if it suffered decreased sales of certain products for great lengths of time with very little extra expense. In 1967, American International Group, Inc. (AIG) was incorporated as a unifying umbrella organization for most of C.V. Starr's general and life insurance businesses.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bowers|first=Barbara|title=Building a Global Platform|newspaper=Best's Review/Life-Health Edition|date=August 1998}}</ref>  In 1968, Starr named Greenberg his successor.

The 1970s presented many challenges for AIG as operations in the Middle East and Southeast Asia were curtailed or ceased altogether due to the changing political landscape. However, AIG continued to expand its markets by introducing specialized energy, transportation, and shipping products to serve the needs of niche industries.<ref name="The AIG Story">{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Lawrence A|title=The AIG Story|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-1-118-34587-0|pages=14–15}}</ref>

===1979–2000: New opportunities and directions===

During the 1980s, AIG continued expanding its market distribution and worldwide network by offering a wide range of specialized products, including pollution liability<ref name="The AIG Story" /> and political risk.<ref name="The AIG Story" />  In 1984, AIG listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).<ref>{{cite news|last=Barreto|first=Elzio|title=AIG marks end of era with $6.45 billion AIA stake sale|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/18/us-aia-aig-idUSBRE8BG01020121218|accessdate=March 7, 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=December 16, 2012}}</ref>  Throughout the 1990s, AIG developed new sources of income through diverse investments, including the acquisition of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), a provider of leased aircraft to the airline industry.<ref name="Laing"/>  In 1992, AIG received the first foreign insurance license granted in over 40 years by the Chinese government. Within the U.S., AIG acquired SunAmerica Inc. a retirement savings company managed by [[Eli Broad]], in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title=Insurers Set $17.8 Billion Stock Deal|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 21, 1998|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/21/business/insurers-set-17.8-billion-stock-deal.html|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref>

===2000–2012: Further expansion and decline===

[[File:Los Angeles Valley, Warner Center, AIG Towers.jpg|thumb|right|The AIG Towers of [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]].]]

====Growth====

The early 2000s saw a marked period of growth as AIG acquired American General Corporation, a leading domestic life insurance and annuities provider,<ref>{{cite news|title=AIG Closes American General Acquisition|newspaper=National Underwriter Life & Health|date=August 30, 2001}}</ref> and AIG entered new markets including India.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tata-AIG to Kick off with IT Products|newspaper=Business Line Internet Edition |url=http://www.hindu.com/businessline/2001/02/12/stories/14124102.htm|date=February 11, 2001}}</ref> In February 2000, AIG created a strategic advisory venture team with the [[Blackstone Group]] and [[Kissinger Associates]] "to provide financial advisory services to corporations seeking high level independent strategic advice".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ir.aigcorporate.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=76115&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=231037&highlight |title=AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC., THE BLACKSTONE GROUP L.P.

In the early 2000s, AIG made significant investments in Russia as the country recovered from its [[1998 Russian financial crisis|financial crisis]]. In July 2003, Maurice Greenberg met with Putin to discuss AIG's investments and improving U.S.-Russia economic ties, in anticipation of Putin's meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush later that year."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Semenenko |first1=Igor |title=AIG, Interros Set Up $500M Funds |url=http://old.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/tmt/236859.html |accessdate=13 February 2019 |agency=The Moscow Times |date=30 July 2003}}</ref>

In November 2004, AIG reached a $126&nbsp;million settlement with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] partly resolving a number of regulatory matters, and the company needed to continue to cooperate with investigators continuing to probe the sale of a non-traditional insurance product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2004/11/24/47993.htm |title=AIG Forks Up $126 million to SEC on PNC Deals |date=November 24, 2004 |publisher=Insurance Journal |accessdate=September 18, 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829181256/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2004/11/24/47993.htm| archive-date=August 29, 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>

====Accounting scandal====

In 2005, AIG became embroiled in a series of fraud investigations conducted by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]], [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]], and [[New York State Attorney General]]'s Office. Greenberg was ousted amid an accounting scandal in February 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14704060 |title=NBC News |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Zuill |first=Lilla |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE5222EV20090303 |title=Reuters |accessdate=July 11, 2011 |date=March 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10898446/greenberg-found-liable-for-aig-fraud.html |title=The Street.com}}</ref> The New York Attorney General's investigation led to a $1.6&nbsp;billion fine for AIG and criminal charges for some of its executives.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2008676239_apgenreaigtrial.html | title = AIG executive sentenced to 4 years in prison | publisher = The Seattle Times | accessdate = May 22, 2014}}</ref>

On May 1, 2005, investigations conducted by outside counsel at the request of AIG's Audit Committee and the consultation with AIG's independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP resulted in AIG's decision to restate its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004 and 2003 and the quarter ended December 31, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/5272/000095012305005362/y08505exv99w1.txt |title= AIG Nears Completion of Internal Review; Will Restate Results Provides Update on Internal Review and Timing}}</ref>
On November 9, 2005, the company was said to have delayed its third-quarter earnings report because it had to restate earlier financial results, to correct accounting errors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-115058504.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105225406/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-115058504.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-11-05 |title= AIG to Again Restates Previous Results }}</ref>

====Expansion to the credit default insurance market====

[[Martin J. Sullivan]] became CEO of the company in 2005. He began his career at AIG as a clerk in its London office in 1970.<ref name="NYT-Andrews-2008-09-16">{{cite news|first1=Edmund L. |last1=Andrews |first2=Michael J. |last2=de la Merced |first3=Mary |last3=Williams Walsh |title=Fed's $85 billion Loan Rescues Insurer |date=September 16, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/17insure.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 17, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430061807/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/17insure.html |archive-date=April 30, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> AIG then took on tens of billions of dollars of risk associated with mortgages. It insured tens of billions of dollars of derivatives against default, but did not purchase reinsurance to hedge that risk. Secondly, it used collateral on deposit to buy mortgage-backed securities. When losses hit the mortgage market in 2007–2008, AIG had to pay out insurance claims and also replace the losses in its collateral accounts.<ref>Maurice R. Greenberg and Lawrence A. Cunningham, ''The AIG Story'' (2013)</ref>

On June 11, 2008, three stockholders, collectively owning 4% of the outstanding stock of AIG, delivered a letter to the Board of Directors of AIG seeking to oust CEO Martin Sullivan and make certain other management and Board of Directors changes. This letter was the latest volley in what ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called a "public spat" between the company's board and management on one hand, and its key stockholders and former CEO Maurice Greenberg on the other hand.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=asOzAMceAsiY |title=AIG Investors Seek Ouster of Chief Executive Sullivan |date=June 11, 2008 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=July 21, 2008}}</ref>
