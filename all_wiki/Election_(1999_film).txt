'''''Election''''' is a 1999 American [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Alexander Payne]] from a screenplay by Payne and [[Jim Taylor (writer)|Jim Taylor]], based on [[Tom Perrotta]]'s 1998 [[Election (1998 novel)|novel of the same name]]. The plot revolves around a [[Student governments in the United States|student body]] election and satirizes politics and high school life. The film stars [[Matthew Broderick]] as Jim McAllister, a popular high school social studies teacher, and [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Tracy Flick]], an overachieving student whom he dislikes. When Tracy runs for student government president, Jim sabotages her candidacy by backing a rival candidate and tampering with the ballot count. Although a [[box office bomb]], ''Election'' received critical acclaim. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for Witherspoon for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress]], and the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film]] in 1999.

==Plot==
Jim McAllister is a beloved [[civics]] teacher at an [[Omaha, Nebraska]], high school. One of his students, [[Tracy Flick]], is an overachieving senior whom he resents. Dave Novotny, Jim's best friend and fellow teacher, lost his job and his wife after Tracy's mother discovered that her daughter was having a sexual relationship with him. While Jim thinks Dave deserved punishment for having sex with a minor, he is bitter that Tracy's mother intervened to protect Tracy from further harm.

Tracy announces that she is running for [[Student Government President|student body president]] and informs Jim that they will be spending time together, since he oversees student government. Appalled by this and the fact that Tracy is running unopposed, Jim encourages Paul Metzler, a popular football player, to enter the race. Sidelined because of a broken leg, Paul finds his candidacy gives him new purpose; it also infuriates Tracy, who resents Paul's effortless popularity and [[Social class|privileged upbringing]].

Paul's younger sister Tammy is dumped by her girlfriend, Lisa Flanagan, who becomes Paul's girlfriend and [[campaign manager]]. Deeply hurt, Tammy exacts revenge by running for president on a nihilistic platform that student government is a sham.

The three candidates make their campaign speeches to the student body at an assembly. Tracy draws polite applause while Paul receives a warm reception, despite giving a halting and lackluster speech. Tammy delivers a defiant address in which she denounces the election and vows to dissolve student government if she wins. Tammy's speech rallies the students to a rowdy [[standing ovation]], but it also gets her suspended from school.

While working on a yearbook project during the weekend, Tracy sees that one of her campaign posters has come untaped from the wall. She tries to secure it but accidentally rips the poster apart. In a fit of rage, she destroys the other candidates' campaign posters and discards them in a [[dumpster]], unaware that Tammy sees this. When Jim confronts Tracy the next day with his suspicion that she removed the posters, Tracy feigns innocence and threatens to sue the school. In a ploy to get permanently expelled, Tammy falsely claims ''she'' [[Vandalism|vandalized]] the posters and produces them as proof, having retrieved them from the dumpster. Tammy is expelled, her name is struck from the ballot, and her parents enroll her in a private [[Catholic school]] for girls—much to her delight.

The day before the election, Jim visits Linda Novotny, Dave's ex-wife, who initiates sex by kissing him. Linda asks Jim to rent a motel room for an after-school rendezvous, but she fails to show. When Jim drives to Linda's house to find her, he is [[Bee sting|stung by a bee]], causing a [[Insect sting allergy|severe allergic reaction]] on his right eyelid. He returns home to find Linda and his wife talking. Knowing his encounter with Linda has been exposed, he spends the night in his car.

During the next day's election, Jim oversees the tally of the [[ballots]], despite being sleep-deprived and disfigured from the bee sting. After the ballots are counted, Tracy wins by a single vote—cast by Paul, who votes for her because he thinks it dishonorable to vote for himself. During the ballot-counting, Jim spots Tracy dancing gleefully in the hall after a student counting votes surreptitiously signals that she won. Jim secretly disposes of two of Tracy's ballots and declares Paul the winner. When a janitor discovers the two discarded ballots in the trash and shows them to the principal, Tracy becomes president and Jim is forced to resign. Jim's wife refuses to forgive him for his tryst with Linda and throws him out of their house.

Divorced and humiliated, Jim leaves Nebraska and fulfills a longtime dream of moving to New York City, where he becomes a tour guide at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and begins dating a new woman. Tracy attends [[Georgetown University]], while Paul enrolls at the [[University of Nebraska]]. Tammy finds a new girlfriend at her all-girls school.

Jim encounters Tracy one last time during a trip to Washington, D.C., when he sees her getting into a limousine with a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]]. Disgusted at Tracy's success, Jim impulsively hurls a cup of soda at the limo as it drives away. Jim later speaks to a group of elementary school students at the museum, refusing to respond to the raised hand of a bright girl who reminds him of Tracy.

==Production==
Director Alexander Payne had become a fan of the novel by Tom Perrotta on which the film is based; the novel's rights were sold to Payne in January 1997. The novel was inspired by two key events. The first was the [[1992 United States presidential election]], in which [[Ross Perot]] entered as a third party candidate (a move echoed by Tammy Metzler). The second was a 1992 incident at [[Memorial High School (Eau Claire, Wisconsin)|Memorial High School]] in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], in which a pregnant student was elected homecoming queen, but staff announced a different winner and burned the ballots to cover it up.<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D71538F937A25753C1A964958260 | title=Officials Deny Pregnant Girl School Crown | work=The New York Times | date=October 14, 1992 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/21/tom-perrotta-interview | title=A life in writing: Tom Perrotta | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Crace | date=February 21, 2009 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

The film uses a number of stylized techniques in its storytelling, particularly through the use of freeze frames, flashbacks and voiceovers, which allow sections of the narrative to be delivered from the points of view of the four main characters.<ref name="variety-review" />

The film was primarily shot on location around the [[Omaha–Council Bluffs metropolitan area|Omaha metro area]] in the fall of 1998, most notably in [[Papillion, Nebraska|Papillion]], [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]] and the [[Dundee–Happy Hollow Historic District|Dundee neighborhood]]. [[Papillion-La Vista Senior High School]] portrayed the fictitious Carver High School with many of the background extras being actual enrolled students at the time. Minor scenes were filmed at [[Younkers]] in [[Westroads Mall]], the [[Old Market (Omaha, Nebraska)|Old Market]] and the [[Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium]].

===Alternate ending===
The film's original ending was not known until a rough workprint of it was found in a box of VHS tapes at a yard sale in 2011. The alternate ending is faithful to the book: Jim stays in Omaha and is hired as a used car salesman by one of his former students instead of moving to New York. Tracy encounters Jim while looking to buy a car and the two settle their differences before she has him sign her yearbook.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.salon.com/2011/05/17/election_original_ending_payne/ |title=The original ending to Alexander Payne's "Election" |first=Drew |last=Grant |magazine=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] |date=May 17, 2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/10/elections-alternate-ending/504230/ |title=Election's Alternate Ending |first=Megan |last=Garber |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |date=October 14, 2016 |access-date=July 1, 2019}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half stars out of four, praising Witherspoon and Payne, and saying, "...here is a movie that is not simply about an obnoxious student, but also about an imperfect teacher, a lockstep administration, and a student body that is mostly just marking time until it can go out into the world and occupy valuable space".<ref>{{cite web | date=April 30, 1999 | last= Ebert | first= Roger | author-link= Roger Ebert | url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/election-1999 | title=Election Movie Review (1999) | work=RogerEbert.com | access-date= November 27, 2016}}</ref>
[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''Variety magazine'' wrote: "Brandishes the sort of intelligent wit and bracing nastiness that will make it more appealing to discerning adults than to teens who just want to have fun."<ref name="variety-review">{{cite news | date=April 19, 1999 | author = Todd McCarthy | title= Election |work= Variety | url= https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117492039 }}</ref>

''Election'' is ranked #61 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] "100 Funniest Movies" and #9 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s list of the "50 Best High School Movies", while Witherspoon's performance was ranked at #45 on the list of the "100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time" by ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]''. According to Payne, it is also President [[Barack Obama]]'s favorite political film.<ref name="huff-oral">{{cite news|quote=Barack Obama has told me twice that it’s his favorite political film.|last=Jacobs|first=Matthew|title=Pick Flick: An Oral History Of 'Election,' 15 Years Later|date=7 May 2014|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/07/election-oral-history_n_5248953.html|access-date=26 October 2015}}</ref>
