==Career==
===Music===
[[File:Rick Springfield 2004 Free.jpg|thumb|left|Springfield during the [[Shock/Denial/Anger/Acceptance|shock/denial/anger/acceptance]] tour in 2004]]
Springfield was 13 when he learned guitar. He joined various bands in England, where his father was stationed from 1958 to 1963, and several more after returning to Australia.<ref name="BIO1" /> In 1968, he was approached by bass guitarist Pete Watson to join his group Rockhouse.<ref name="MilesMPD"/> Later that year, Watson changed the band's name to MPD Ltd and, in October when Springfield was 19 years old, they toured [[Vietnam|South Vietnam]] to entertain Australian troops. Another member of MPD Ltd was Danny Finley (drummer). Upon returning to Australia, they formed Wickedy Wak.<ref name="MilesMPD"/> They were joined by Phil Blackmore on keyboards and Dick Howard.<ref name="MilesMPD"/> ''[[Go-Set]]'' journalist [[Molly Meldrum|Ian "Molly" Meldrum]] produced Wickedy Wak's single, "Billie's Bikie Boys", with [[Beeb Birtles]] of pop rock group [[Zoot (band)|Zoot]] as a backing vocalist.<ref name="MilesZ"/>

In September 1969, Springfield replaced Roger Hicks as lead guitarist and vocalist in Zoot, with Birtles on bass guitar and vocals, [[Darryl Cotton]] on lead vocals and guitar, and Rick Brewer on drums.<ref name="McF"/> Upon joining Zoot, Springfield adopted the "Think Pink{{spaced ndash}}Think Zoot" theme that had the band members dressed head to toe in pink satin.<ref name="MilesZ"/><ref name="McFZ"/> The publicity gimmick brought attention to the group and attracted numerous teenage girl fans; however it caused problems in establishing their credibility as serious rock musicians.<ref name="MilesZ"/><ref name="McFZ"/> Zoot's fifth single, "Hey Pinky", was written by Springfield.<ref name="APRA HeyPinky"/> The group attempted to shake off their teeny-bopper image.<ref name="MilesZ"/><ref name="McFZ"/> They followed with a hard rock cover version of [[The Beatles]]' hit "[[Eleanor Rigby]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on ''Go-Set'''s Top&nbsp;40 in March 1971.<ref name="GoSetEleanor"/> Despite another hit single with "Freak" in April,<ref name="GoSetFreak"/> which was written by Springfield,<ref name="APRA Freak"/> the band broke up in May.<ref name="McFZ"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rickspringfield.com/timeline|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412123736/http://www.rickspringfield.com/timeline.php|archive-date=12 April 2010 |title=Official Web Site |publisher=Rick Springfield |access-date=6 April 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birtles.com/zoot.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909152211/http://www.birtles.com/zoot.html|archive-date=9 September 2010 |title=Zoot |publisher=Birtles.com |date=7 June 2002 |access-date=6 April 2010}}</ref>

Springfield signed with [[Sparmac Records]] and issued his debut solo single, "Speak to the Sky", in October, which peaked at No.&nbsp;5 on the ''Go-Set'' singles chart.<ref name="GoSetSpeak"/> Sparmac label owner, [[Robie Porter]], was also producer and manager for Springfield.<ref name="MilesZ"/> After recording his debut album, ''Beginnings'', in London, Springfield moved to the United States in mid-1972.<ref name="McFZ"/> Springfield provided all the songwriting, lead vocals, guitar, keyboard and banjo for the album.<ref name="McF"/> In August 1972 "Speak to the Sky" was issued in the U.S. by [[Capitol Records]] and peaked at No.&nbsp;14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in September.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="BillboardSingles"/> ''Beginnings'' was the first of seven top&nbsp;40 Springfield albums on the related [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="AllmusicAlbums"/> However, follow-up success was hampered by rumours that Capitol Records paid people to purchase Springfield's albums, which led to some radio stations boycotting his music.<ref>According to the 2005 [[A&E Network|A&E]] documentary ''Rick Springfield: Behind The Image''.</ref>

[[File:Rick Springfield in Boston 2011.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Springfield in September 2011 before a performance in Boston]]
In 1973, Springfield signed to [[Columbia Records]] and recorded his second album, ''Comic Book Heroes'', which was also produced by Porter.<ref name="McF"/> In Australia, released on Porter's new label, Wizard Records, the album and its two singles failed to chart.<ref name="McF"/> Springfield was promoted as a teeny pop idol similar to [[David Cassidy]] and [[Donny Osmond]].<ref name="McF"/> Springfield spoke of the [[teenybopper]] image in ''[[Circus Magazine]]''<ref name=CircusMag_spring>"Rick Springfield – A Comic Book Hero No More" by Hugh Slafia, p. 27, ''[[Circus Magazine]]'', No 36 – Vol 8, No 3, 1973 – Circus Enterprises Organisation K47453.</ref> in 1973. He said he was not sure how it happened. "Someone saw my photo and that was it."<ref name=CircusMag_spring /> He went on to say that someone asked to take a photo of him in a white suit and thought that it was "a bit dull", so he took some crayons and "scrawled an R with a lightning bolt going through it ... which became my [[emblem]]."<ref name=CircusMag_spring /> From September 1972 to September 1973, Springfield starred as "himself" in the ABC-TV Saturday morning cartoon series ''[[Mission: Magic!]]'', for which he usually wrote and performed an original song in each episode. In 1974, he issued an Australia-only album, ''Mission: Magic!'', which was "full of infectious bubblegum pop songs".<ref name="McF"/> His single, "Take a Hand", reached the U.S. top&nbsp;50 in 1976. The single was taken from the album ''[[Wait for Night]]'', which was issued by his new label, Chelsea Records. Soon after its release, the record company folded.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="BillboardSingles"/> During the late 1970s, he concentrated more on his acting career, guest-starring in several primetime TV dramas.<ref name="BIO1" /><ref name="McF"/>

Springfield continued to write and record and, in 1981, released his next album, ''[[Working Class Dog]]''. The album spawned the single "[[Jessie's Girl]]", a worldwide hit which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 for two weeks in the U.S. on the Hot 100 and the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] singles chart.<ref name="BillboardSingles"/><ref name="Kent"/> Springfield won the 1981 [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]].<ref name="AllmusicAwards"/><ref name="GrammyAwards"/> ''Working Class Dog'' reached No.7 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="AllmusicAlbums"/> Another top&nbsp;10 single from the album was the [[Sammy Hagar]]-penned "[[I've Done Everything for You]]".<ref name="McF"/><ref name="BillboardSingles"/> He had further success with the follow-up albums ''[[Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet]]'' (1982) and ''[[Living in Oz]]'' (1983). Springfield was frustrated with people in interviews mistaking him for [[Bruce Springsteen]], expressed in the track "Bruce" on the album ''Beautiful Feelings'' (1984). In 1984, Springfield starred in his own movie, ''[[Hard to Hold (film)|Hard to Hold]]'', and recorded the majority of the material on the [[Hard to Hold|accompanying soundtrack]]. The soundtrack included a top-ten hit, "Love Somebody", as well as several moderately successful follow-up singles. However, the movie itself was not successful, and the soundtrack's success (though higher than that of the movie) paled in comparison to previous Springfield albums. Nonetheless, Springfield released his next album ''[[Tao (album)|Tao]]'' in 1985, scoring several modest hits from this release, including "[[State of the Heart (song)|State of the Heart]]" and "Celebrate Youth". That same year, Springfield was one of several performers who participated in the [[Live Aid]] charity concert.<ref name="TSMR1">{{cite news|title='Global jukebox' makes plea for Africa |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FbUfAAAAIBAJ&pg=2157,898536&dq=rick+springfield+live+aid&hl=en|access-date=25 June 2010|newspaper=The Southeast Missourian |date=14 July 1985|last=Linder|first=Lee|agency=Associated Press|page=6}}</ref> Around this time, he took a brief hiatus from recording.

Springfield returned in 2020 via a one-off featured performance in the [[Coheed and Cambria]] single "Jessie's Girl 2,"<ref>https://www.spin.com/2020/08/coheed-and-cambria-share-jessies-girl-2-video-featuring-rick-springfield/</ref> a sequel to the 1981 Springfield single "[[Jessie's Girl]]."

===Acting===
{{main|Noah Drake|Eli Love}}
Springfield made his acting debut on ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' on 30 October 1977, in an episode entitled "Rollback". In December, he appeared on ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', portraying Ned Nickerson. On 20 January 1978, Springfield guest-starred on an episode of ''Wonder Woman'' entitled "Screaming Javelin." The character he portrayed was Tom, the concerned fiancé of an Olympic gymnast who had been kidnapped by a megalomaniac. Later in 1978, Springfield played the character of [[Zac (Battlestar Galactica)|Zac]] in ''[[Saga of a Star World]]'', which was, with some differences, the pilot episode of the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original ''Battlestar Galactica'' TV series]]. He also co-starred as Keith Stewart in episode 17 of season 4 ("Dwarf in a Helium Hat") on ''[[The Rockford Files]]''  and as Tommy Archer in episode 4 ("Murder on the Flip Side") of ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'' in 1978. In 1979, he guest-starred on an episode of "The Incredible Hulk" entitled "The Disciple" as Michael Roark, a police officer who must decide whether to avenge the death of his father who was also a police officer, or simply provide justice and capture the alleged criminal.  In 1981, he became a soap opera star on ''[[General Hospital]]''. He had signed a contract with [[RCA Records]] and already recorded the album ''[[Working Class Dog]]'', which neither he nor his agent had expected would do very well, which is why Springfield took the soap role. But the song "Jessie's Girl" went to No. 1 and Springfield ended up both playing the role of [[Noah Drake|Dr. Noah Drake]] from 1981 to 1983, while simultaneously going on tour with his band. The success of the song boosted the ratings of the show which, according to Springfield, "became the biggest show on TV for that summer". The fame from the show also boosted the sale of the song.<ref name=soap>''Soapography'', "Rick Springfield and [[Kimberly McCullough]]", aired 16 June 2007 on [[SOAPnet]]</ref> 
In 1984, Springfield made a full-length feature film titled ''[[Hard to Hold (film)|Hard to Hold]]''. In 1998, he played in the film ''[[Legion (1998 film)|Legion]]''.

The song makes references to "Dr. Noah Drake" as well as to "Jessie's Girl".
