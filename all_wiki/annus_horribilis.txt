'''''{{lang|la|Annus horribilis}}''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase, meaning "horrible year". It is complementary to ''{{lang|la|[[annus mirabilis]]}}'', which means "wonderful year".

==Origin of phrase==
The phrase ''annus horribilis'' was used in 1891 in an Anglican publication to describe 1870, the year in which the Roman Catholic church defined the dogma of [[papal infallibility]].<ref>{{cite book|title=London Quarterly and Holborn Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NpxJAQAAMAAJ|volume=75|year=1891|publisher=E.C.

== Elizabeth II ==
