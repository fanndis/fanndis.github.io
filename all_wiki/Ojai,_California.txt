'''Ojai''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|h|aɪ}} {{respell|OH|hy}}) is a city in [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. Located in the Ojai Valley, it is northwest of [[Los Angeles]] and east of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. The valley is part of the east–west trending Western Transverse Ranges and is about {{convert|10|mi|km}} long by {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} wide and divided into a lower and an upper valley, each of similar size, surrounded by hills and mountains. The population was 7,461 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], down from 7,862 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].

Ojai is a tourism destination known for its boutique hotels, recreation opportunities, hiking, and farmers' market of local organic agriculture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-tr-522-escape-ojai-20160513-snap-story.html |title=Rustic Ojai transports the eyes and the taste buds to a spiritual plane |date= May 19, 2016|first=Rosemary |last=McClure |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=10 June 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It has small businesses specializing in local and ecologically friendly art, design, and home improvement. Chain stores are prohibited by city ordinance to encourage local small business development and keep the town unique.

The name Ojai is derived from the Ventureño Chumash word 'Awha'y, meaning moon.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">Tumamait-Stenslie, Julie.

==History==

=== Chumash ===
The Chumash are a Native American people who inhabited the central and southern coastal regions of California, in portions of what are now Morro Bay in the north to Malibu in the south and the Channel Islands. [[Chumash people|Chumash]] Indians were the early inhabitants of the Ojai Valley. The name Ojai is derived from the Ventureño Chumash word ʼawha'y meaning "moon."<ref name=":0">Harrington, John Peabody. ''The Papers of John Peabody Harrington in the Smithsonian Institution 1907-1957''. Kraus International Publications, 1981, 3.89.66-73</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /> A 1905 book on place names in the United States records the name Ojai as being derived from an Indigenous word meaning "nest", though the specific Indigenous nation is not identified.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | last=Gannett |first=Henry | year=1905 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n229 230]}}</ref>

=== Rancho Ojai ===
{{main|Rancho Ojai}}
In 1837, Fernando Tico, a Santa Barbara businessman, received the 17,716-acre Rancho Ojai Mexican land grant, which included both the lower and upper Ojai valleys. Tico operated a cattle ranch on the land and moved his large family to an adobe in the lower valley. Tico sold the entire Rancho Ojai in 1853.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''. Ojai Valley Museum. 2017. pp. 16-18</ref> The rancho changed hands several more times before it was purchased in 1864 by [[Thomas A. Scott]], a Pennsylvania oil and railroad baron. The petroleum exploration of the Ojai Basin was the result of a report of [[petroleum seep|oil seeps]] (oil springs) along the Sulphur Mountain area. In 1866, Scott's nephew [[Thomas Bard]] used a steam-powered cable-tool [[drilling rig]] on the north side of Sulphur Mountain. On May 29, 1867, Ojai No. 6 produced an [[oil gusher]], at a depth of 550 feet, and the Ojai Field eventually produced 10-20 [[barrels of oil]] a day.  Also in 1866, [[Leland Stanford]]'s brother Josiah dug oil tunnels on the south side of Sulphur Mountain, producing 20 barrels a day for the Stanford Brothers refinery in San Francisco. For economic reasons, falling oil prices at the end of the Civil War and cheaper imports from the east, Scott and Stanford ceased oil exploration in the valley area.  Thomas Bard then began selling the surface rights to parcels of Rancho Ojai in late 1867. As the president of [[Unocal]], Bard would return in the 1890s to dig about 50 oil tunnels into Sulphur Mountain, which produced until 1998.<ref>Sheridan, Solomon Neill.

=== Nordhoff ===
The town was laid out in 1874<ref>[http://gis.ventura.org/RecordMaps/mr/001/001mr225.pdf "MAP of the town of NORDHOFF"] 1 MR 225. ''Ventura County Recorder'' Retrieved December 3, 2013 from [http://gis.ventura.org/CountyView/ CountyView GIS].</ref> by San Buenaventura businessman [[R. G. Surdam|R.G. Surdam]] and named Nordhoff in honor of the writer [[Charles Nordhoff (journalist)|Charles Nordhoff]] who had written a book about California titled, ''California for Health, Pleasure and Residence: A Book for Travelers and Settlers''. Most early settlers to the valley had one or more family members who were ill, particularly with respiratory illnesses, and the Ojai Valley developed a reputation for having healthy air quality. Many did get well after moving to the valley. Charles Nordhoff had not visited the Ojai Valley when his book came out in 1873, but made several visits to his namesake town in the early 1880s, and he mentioned the Ojai Valley in the revised 1882 version of his popular book.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''. Ojai Valley Museum. 2017. pp. 30-31</ref> The discovery of hot springs in Matilija Canyon and subsequent development of hot springs resorts in the late 1800s contributed to the valley's healing mystique.

The public high school in Ojai is still named [[Nordhoff High School]]. The public junior high school, named "Matilija", formerly served as Nordhoff Union High School and still features large tiles with the initials "NUHS" on the steps of the athletic field.

=== Railroad ===
The [[Ventura and Ojai Valley Railroad]] connected Ojai to the [[Coast Line (UP)|national rail network]] near [[Ventura station]] in 1898.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ojaihistory.com/the-iron-horse-came-to-the-valley-in-98/ |title=The "iron horse" came to the valley in '98 |last=Wenig |first=Ed |website=Ojai History |publisher=Ojai Valley Museam |accessdate=25 January 2019 |date=2017-10-06 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Southern Pacific Railroad acquired all the capital stock in the Ventura and Ojai Valley Railroad in April 1898.<ref>Myrick, David F., "The Railroad Comes to Nordhoff in the Ojai Valley," Ventura County Railroads, A Centennial History, Vol. II, ''The Ventura County Historical Society Quarterly, Vol. 33, Nos. 2 & 3'', 1988, 19-20</ref> A nine-day [[Pineapple Express]] with rainfall intensity reaching {{convert|6.2|inch|cm}} per day caused floods destroying the rail line in January 1969.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pyle |first=Russ |title =The Great Flood: Ventura County |publisher =Dan Poush |date =1969 }}</ref> The former rail line was converted to the Ojai Valley Trail in 1989.<ref>{{cite book |last =Salcedo-Chourré |first =Tracy |title =Rails-to-Trails: California |publisher =The Globe Pequot Press |date =2001 |location =[[Guilford, Connecticut]] |page =[https://archive.org/details/railstotrailscal00trac/page/165 165] |isbn =978-0-7627-0448-4 |url =https://archive.org/details/railstotrailscal00trac/page/165 }}</ref>

=== Libbey ===
Nordhoff became a popular wintering spot for wealthy Easterners and Midwesterners. The elite Foothills Hotel, which catered to them, was built on a mountain overlooking the town in 1903. Visitors enjoyed dining, music concerts, horseback riding, and hunting and fishing trips into the back country. Some of these businessmen built homes in the valley and contributed to the community's development. Among these winter visitors were Edward Drummond Libbey and his wife Florence. Their first winter in Ojai was in 1907. Libbey was the owner of the Libbey Glass Company of Toledo, Ohio. He fell in love with the valley, bought property in the Foothills tract in 1909, and built a Craftsman-style house designed by Myron Hunt and Elmer Grey.<ref>Walker, Craig. ''Ojai by Design: Fine Architecture of the Ojai Valley''. Arts Commission of the City of Ojai. 2017. p.12</ref>

Steeped in [[City Beautiful]] ideals, Libbey began thinking about what could be done to beautify the existing rustic town. He bought up all the properties on the south side of Ojai Avenue (where Libbey Park is today) and most of the buildings there were demolished. In 1916, he hired the architectural firm of Frank Mead and Richard Requa of San Diego to transform Nordhoff into the Spanish-style town center seen today. The project included a Mission-style arcade along the main street, a bell-tower reminiscent of the famous campanile of the Cathedral of the Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Havana, Cuba (also known as the Havana Cathedral), and a pergola with two arches opposite the arcade. In March 1917, just after completion of the renovation project, the name of the town was changed to Ojai. The valley had always been known as "The Ojai" and it made sense with the town's new image to change its name as well.<ref>Lewis, Mark. "Inventing Ojai," ''Ojai Quarterly'', Winter 2016-17, pp.120-126</ref>

Leading up to and during World War I, American sentiment became increasingly [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]]. Across the United States, German and German-sounding place names were changed. Some Ojai writers in the past have speculated that anti-German sentiment contributed to the name change of Nordhoff to Ojai in 1917.<ref>{{cite news|title=Looking for Charles Nordhoff|last=Meltzer|first=Betty Kikumi|date=2005-08-21|work=Redlands Daily Facts|location=Redlands, Calif.|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rediscovering the Lost Horizon: Shangri-la Does Exist - It's in California and It's Idyllic, says Angela Wigglesworth|last=Wigglesworth|first=Angela|date=1998-08-29|work=Financial Times|location=London (UK)|page=18|df=mdy-all}}</ref> There is no clear evidence that this was the case for the name change in Ojai.

To thank Libbey for his gifts to the town, the citizens proposed a celebration in the new Civic Center Park (later changed to Libbey Park) that they wished to call "Libbey Day," but Libbey suggested "Ojai Day" instead. The first Ojai Day took place April 7, 1917.<ref>"Idealized Ojai Receives Recognition As Does Also Its Benefactor," ''The Ojai'', April 13, 1917, 1</ref> Ojai Day was celebrated each year until 1928. Local schoolteacher Craig Walker revived Ojai Day in 1991 and it has been celebrated since.<ref name=":2">Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt, and Craig Walker. ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History.'' Ojai Valley Museum Edition. 2017. Ojai, California. p.225, pp. 333-334</ref> The Ojai Day celebration takes place in October.

In 1917 two fires struck the community. The first started in Matilija Canyon on June 16 and burned 60 buildings in its path, including many homes and the Foothills Hotel. The newly Spanish-style structures in the downtown were not affected. On November 28, 1917, a fire started in a gasoline stove in a store in the Arcade and the stores in the western half of the Arcade burned down. Part of the Arcade suffered smoke damage but did not burn down.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''. Ojai Valley Museum. 2017. pp.188-189</ref> A new Spanish-style Foothills Hotel was built in 1919–1920 to replace the one that burned down.

The Taormina neighborhood was established as the first historic district in the city in 2016. The housing development was built in the style of French [[architecture of Normandy]] in the 1960s and 1970s by members of the [[Theosophical Society in America|Theosophy movement]] adjacent to the [[Krotona Institute of Theosophy]]. Taormina's founder, theosophist Ruth Wilson, envisioned the development as a [[retirement community]] for fellow theosophists but in the early 1980s a court ruling required the community to be open to residents of all faiths and backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/communities/ojai/2016/08/31/ojai-names-taormina-its-first-historic-district/89496504/ |title=Ojai names Taormina its first historic district |first=Claudia |last=Boyd-Barrett |date=31 August 2016 |newspaper=[[Ventura County Star]] |access-date=2 September 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Geography==
Ojai is situated in a small east–west eponymous valley, north of [[Ventura, California|Ventura]] and east of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].<ref name="NYT 2020/03/03">{{Cite news|last=Kamin|first=Debra|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/realestate/ojai-calif-a-valley-of-wellness-but-no-chain-stores-in-ventura-county.html|title=Ojai, Calif.: A Valley of Wellness (but No Chain Stores) in Ventura County|date=2020-03-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The city is approximately {{convert|745|ft|m}} above sea level and borders the [[Los Padres National Forest]] to the north.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} inland from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Ojai Valley lies within the [[Topa Topa Mountains]] on the north and south and is actively shaped by a web of earthquake faults.{{r|NYT 2020/03/03}} The Santa Ynez Mountains lie to the north, while Sulphur Mountain and the lower Black Mountain lie to the south. The mountains to the west of the Ojai Valley are drained by the Coyote, Matilija and Santa Ana creeks. These empty into the Ventura River. The Matilija Dam, Casitas Dam and Lake Casitas Reservoir alter the historic drainage of these creeks and the river. The creeks that drain the mountains directly north of Ojai empty into San Antonio Creek, as does Lion Canyon Creek that lies between Black Mountain and Sulphur Mountain. San Antonio Creek drains into the Ventura River just north of Casitas Springs. The [[Ventura River]] flows through the Ventura River Valley and empties into the Pacific Ocean at the city of Ventura.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''. Ojai Valley Museum. 2017. pp. xvi-xvii</ref> The Ventura River was once known for its steelhead fishing before [[Matilija Dam]] and [[Lake Casitas]] were constructed, eliminating habitat for this trout species.

The eastern part of the Upper Ojai Valley is drained by the Sisar and Santa Paula creeks. These creeks flow into the Santa Clara River at Santa Paula. The high mountains above the Ojai Valley and further east are drained by Sespe Creek, which empties into the Santa Clara River at Fillmore. In 1991, 31.5 miles of the 55-mile-long Sespe Creek was given federal Wild & Scenic River status.<ref>Keep the Sespe Wild Committee. http://www.sespewild.org/</ref>

Sulphur Mountain creates the southern ranges bounding the Ojai Valley, a little under {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in elevation.

===Climate===
The climate of Ojai is [[mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], characterized by hot, dry summers, at times exceeding {{convert|100|F|C|1|disp=or}}, and mild, rainy winters, with lows at night falling below freezing at times. During dry spells with continental air, morning temperatures, due to Ojai's valley location, can drop well below most of Southern California, with the record being {{convert|13|F|C|1}} on January 6 and 7 of 1913. In contrast, Ojai is far enough from the sea to minimize marine cooling, and very hot days can occur during summer, with the record being {{convert|119|F|C|1}} on June 16, 1917 – when it fell as low as {{convert|65|F|C|1}} in the morning due to clear skies and dry air.

As is typical for much of coastal southern California, most precipitation falls in the form of rain between the months of October and April, with intervening dry summers. As with all of Southern California, rain falls on few days, but when it does rain it is often extremely heavy: the record being {{convert|9.05|in|mm|1}} on February 24, 1913, followed by {{convert|8.15|in|mm|1}} on January 26, 1914. During the wettest month on record of January 1969, {{convert|25.76|in|mm|1|disp=or}} fell, with a whopping {{convert|23.46|in|mm|1}} in eight days from January 19 to January 26. In contrast, the median annual rainfall for all years in Ojai is only around {{convert|18.1|in|mm|0|disp=or}} and in the driest "rain year" from July 2006 to June 2007, just {{convert|6.87|in|mm|1|disp=or}} fell in twelve months. The wettest "rain year" was from July 1997 to June 1998 with {{convert|48.29|in|mm|1}}.

[[File:Ojai Valley Museum.jpg|thumb|Ojai Valley Museum, 2009]]
The town of Ojai and its surrounding area is home to many recreational activities. [[Los Padres National Forest]] borders the town on the north, and many back country areas within the forest are accessible from [[California State Route 33|Highway 33]], the major north–south highway through town. Matilija Creek is a spot to enjoy splashing under waterfalls and backpacking. To the west, the [[Lake Casitas Recreation Area]] offers camping, picnicking, hiking, boating, fishing, and has a water park. No swimming or body contact is allowed in Lake Casitas.

The valley has several public tennis courts in downtown Libbey Park. There are also two major golf courses: the Soule Park Golf Course, and the noted Ojai Valley Inn Golf Course. The town completed a new park, [[Cluff Vista Park]], in 2002, which contains several small themed regions of [[List of California native plants|California native plants]], two water features, and three public art works. The park is located on a small hill which has a great view of the mountains surrounding the town.

Sarzotti Park is a {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=mid}} city park that is home to the City of Ojai Recreation Center. The center was formerly the Boyd Clubhouse which was built in 1903 and located on the south side of Ojai Avenue east of Libbey Park. The Boyd Club was a men's athletic and activity club. The Boyd clubhouse was moved to Sarzotti Park in 1957. the city's recreational program offers soccer, softball, football, basketball, tennis, volleyball, exercise programs, and many other classes. The [https://www.ojairec.com/ Ojai Recreation Department] publishes an activity guide several times a year.

In April, the [[Ojai Tennis Tournament]] is held. It is the oldest tennis tournament west of the [[Mississippi River]] (founded in 1896) and has been an early competition for many players who went on to earn one or more [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles. The Wall of Fame in Libbey Park honors players who competed in "The Ojai" and went on to win at least one Grand Slam.<ref>[http://www.ojaitourney.org/history/ "History"] ''The Ojai Tennis Tournament'' official Website Accessed 28 February 2014</ref> The tournament holds amateur competitions for boys and girls and Pacific-10 (now Pac-12) competitions. William Thacher (brother of Sherman Thacher) founded the Ojai Valley Tennis Club in 1895 and this group has been organizing "The Ojai" tennis tournament ever since. The group began sponsoring tennis competitions in 1896 and they use this date as the beginning of "The Ojai." There were five years when the tournament was not held: 1924 because of a hoof-and-mouth epidemic and from 1943 to 1946 during and just after World War II.<ref>Thacher, Tony.

==Media==
The ''[[Ojai Valley News]]'' is a weekly, community-oriented newspaper that has been published since Oct. 27, 1891. The newspaper was called ''The Ojai'' until 1958. A newspaper called ''The Ojai Valley News'' was founded in competition to ''The Ojai'' in 1949. In 1958, J. Frank Knebel bought ''The Ojai'', ''The Ojai Valley News'' and another small paper called ''The Oaks Gazette''. He called this combined paper the ''Ojai Valley News and Oaks Gazette.''  A competition newspaper called ''The Ojai Press'' was founded in 1959 and another called ''The Oaks Sentinel'' came out the following year. When both of these papers floundered a group of over 100 people called "Voice of the Valley" pitched in to take over these papers and began publishing the ''Press Sentinel''. Members of the Voice of the Valley group felt strongly that there needed to be an alternative viewpoint in the valley from the views expressed in Knebel's paper. The ''Press Sentinel'' was published for two years. When Fred Volz purchased ''The Ojai Valley News and Oaks Gazette'' in 1962, changing the name to ''Ojai Valley News,'' the ''Press Sentinel'' ceased publication.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''.

In these series, a sign on the highway entering Ojai reads "Welcome to Ojai, home of American astronaut Steven Austin."<ref>[[The Six Million Dollar Man]], season two, episode 19.</ref> In ''The Bionic Woman'', Jaime Sommers makes her home in Ojai and thus many episodes of that series, in whole or in part, take place there. Sommers works as a schoolteacher at the fictional Ventura Air Force Base, which is depicted as being close to Ojai.

In the 1990 movie ''[[Hard to Kill]]'', Mason Storm, played by Steven Seagal, was brought to Ojai to flee his enemies, and track 8 on the soundtrack from David Michael Frank is called Escape From Ojai.

Ojai is also the city in which the character of Jake Hanson (played by [[Grant Show]]) buys a restaurant and relocates to after leaving Los Angeles in the final season of the TV series ''[[Melrose Place]]''.
