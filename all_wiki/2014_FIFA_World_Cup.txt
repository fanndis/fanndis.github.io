===FIFA Fan Fests===
For a third consecutive World Cup tournament, FIFA staged [[FIFA Fan Fest]]s in each of the 12 host cities throughout the competition. Prominent examples were the [[Copacabana Beach]] in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and [[São Paulo]]'s Vale do Anhangabaú.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldcupfancamp.com/viewtopic.php?f=118&t=10273 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203025331/http://worldcupfancamp.com/viewtopic.php?f=118&t=10273 |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 February 2014 |title=World Cup 2014 FanCamps and FanFests |accessdate=8 August 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1614471/ |title=FIFA Fan Fest locations confirmed |accessdate=20 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201164228/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1614471/ |archive-date=1 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first official event took place on [[Praia de Iracema|Iracema Beach]], in [[Fortaleza]], on 8 June 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=6/news=ronaldo-kicks-off-fifa-fan-fest-2360141.html|title=Ronaldo kicks off FIFA Fan Fest|date=9 June 2014|access-date=13 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625151457/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=6/news=ronaldo-kicks-off-fifa-fan-fest-2360141.html|archive-date=25 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Brazil and Colombia match at the FIFA World Cup 2014-07-04 (15) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Adidas Brazuca]]
To avoid [[ghost goal]]s the 2014 World Cup introduced [[goal-line technology]] following successful trials at among others [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013 Confederations Cup]]. The chosen [[GoalControl|Goal Control system]] featured 14 high speed cameras, 7 directed to each of the goals. Data were sent to the central image-processing centre, where a virtual representation of the ball was output on a widescreen to confirm the goal. The referee was equipped with a watch which vibrated and displayed a signal upon a goal.<ref name=DW>{{cite web|title=Behind the Scenes with GoalControl |url=http://www.dw.de/behind-the-scenes-with-goalcontrol/av-17711403 |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |accessdate=14 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714183652/http://www.dw.de/behind-the-scenes-with-goalcontrol/av-17711403 |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref><ref name=Yah>{{cite web|title=World Cup 2014: Goal Control goal-line technology to be used in Brazil|url=https://news.yahoo.com/video/world-cup-2014-goal-control-051750367.html|website=Yahoo!

Following successful trials,{{refn|group=nb|The spray was trialled at the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup]], [[2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] and [[2013 FIFA Club World Cup]]}} FIFA approved the use of [[vanishing spray]] by the referees for the first time at a World Cup Finals. The water-based spray, which disappears within minutes of application, can be used to mark a ten-yard line for the defending team during a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free kick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.eurosport.com/football/world-cup/2014/vanishing-spray-set-for-world-cup_sto4056067/story.shtml|title=Vanishing spray set for World Cup|work=eurosport.com|date=21 November 2013|access-date=21 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224101932/http://au.eurosport.com/football/world-cup/2014/vanishing-spray-set-for-world-cup_sto4056067/story.shtml|archive-date=24 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

The number of panels was reduced to six, with the panels being thermally bonded. This created a ball with increased consistency and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet the approval of football professionals.

===Cooling breaks===
Because of the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks for the players were introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/fifa/13379-fifa-approves-extra-breaks-to-help-players-keep-their-cool |title=FIFA approves extra breaks to help players keep their cool |publisher=Inside World Football |date=7 October 2013 |accessdate=18 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708072148/http://www.insideworldfootball.com/fifa/13379-fifa-approves-extra-breaks-to-help-players-keep-their-cool |archive-date=8 July 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Breaks could take place at the referee's discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the [[Wet Bulb Globe Temperature]] exceeded {{convert|32|C}}.

==Format==
{{anchor|Tie-breaking_criteria}}
The first round, or group stage, was a competition between the 32 teams divided among eight groups of four, where each group engaged in a [[round-robin tournament]] within itself. The two highest ranked teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage.<ref name="regulations"/> Teams were awarded three points for a win and one for a draw. When comparing teams in a group over-all result came before head-to-head.
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
|-
! Tie-breaking criteria for group play
|-
|The ranking of teams in each group was based on the following criteria:
# Number of points
# [[Goal difference]] 
# Number of goals scored 
# Number of points obtained in matches between tied teams
# Goal difference in matches between tied teams 
# Number of goals scored in matches between tied teams
# Drawing of lots
|}
In the [[single-elimination tournament|knockout stage]] there were four rounds (round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final), with each eliminating the losers. The two semi-final losers competed in a third place play-off. For any match in the knockout stage, a draw after 90 minutes of regulation time was followed by two 15 minute periods of [[Overtime (association football)|extra time]] to determine a winner. If the teams were still tied, a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] was held to determine a winner.<ref name="regulations"/>

On 12 June 2014, the 20th edition of the [[FIFA World Cup]] began with the opening ceremony at [[Arena Corinthians|Arena de São Paulo]], [[São Paulo]], Brazil. The event saw 660 dancers take to the stadium and perform in a ceremony which celebrated the nature of the country and its love of football.

She was later joined by Cuban-American rapper [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], and American singer [[Jennifer Lopez]] to perform the tournament's official song "[[We Are One (Ole Ola)]]" which had been released as an official single on 8 April 2014.

==Group stage==
The group stage of the cup took place in [[Brazil]] from 12 June 2014 to 26 June 2014: each team played three games. The group stage was notable for a scarcity of draws and a large number of goals. The first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25285113</ref> The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Group stage goal glut brightens World Cup|url=http://www.dw.de/group-stage-goal-glut-brightens-world-cup/a-17740469|date=26 June 2014|publisher=Deutsche Welle|access-date=27 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627050633/http://www.dw.de/group-stage-goal-glut-brightens-world-cup/a-17740469|archive-date=27 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28043070 |title=World Cup 2014: Statistical XI versus your tournament XI |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=27 June 2014 |access-date=13 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125232505/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28043070 |archive-date=25 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the largest average in a group stage since 1958.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistically the greatest World Cup?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28054653|date=27 June 2014|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=22 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619192628/https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28054653|archive-date=19 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy's from the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 tournament]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2014/06/21/spain-aims-to-avoid-worst-ever-world-cup-defense/11207503/ | work=USA Today | title=Spain aims to avoid worst ever World Cup defense | date=21 June 2014 | access-date=23 August 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710075319/https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2014/06/21/spain-aims-to-avoid-worst-ever-world-cup-defense/11207503/ | archive-date=10 July 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup/world-cup-2014-spain-and-the-world-cup-holders-who-crashed-out-at-the-group-stage-9547351.html |accessdate=18 April 2015 |newspaper=The Independent |date=18 June 2014 |last=Krishnan |first=Joe |title=World Cup 2014: Spain and the World Cup holders who crashed out at the group stage |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624060542/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup/world-cup-2014-spain-and-the-world-cup-holders-who-crashed-out-at-the-group-stage-9547351.html |archive-date=24 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Netherlands defeated Brazil 3–0 to secure third place, the first for the Dutch team in their history. Overall, Brazil conceded 14 goals in the tournament; this was the most by a team at any single World Cup since 1986, and the most by a host nation in history, although their fourth-place finish still represented Brazil's best result in a World Cup since their last win in 2002.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/fifa-world-cup-2014/world-cup-match-report/world-cup-2014-netherlands-pile-more-misery-on-brazil-in-third-place-playoff-20140713-zt5so.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | agency=Agence France-Presse | date=13 July 2014 | title=World Cup 2014: Netherlands pile more misery on Brazil in third place play-off | access-date=13 July 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715042216/http://www.smh.com.au/fifa-world-cup-2014/world-cup-match-report/world-cup-2014-netherlands-pile-more-misery-on-brazil-in-third-place-playoff-20140713-zt5so.html | archive-date=15 July 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>

===Head injuries===

First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender [[Álvaro Pereira]] received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/fifa-world-cup-2014/world-cup-news-2014/alvaro-pereira-knocked-out-then-raring-to-go-20140620-zsfqt.html|title=Alvaro Pereira, knocked out then raring to go|date=20 June 2014|first=Tom|last=Decent|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=1 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809121053/http://www.smh.com.au/fifa-world-cup-2014/world-cup-news-2014/alvaro-pereira-knocked-out-then-raring-to-go-20140620-zsfqt.html|archive-date=9 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2014/07/13/ap-soc-wcup-final-concussion |title=Kramer head injury revives concussion concern |date=13 July 2014 |work=Sports Illustrated |access-date=6 January 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919115452/https://www.si.com/soccer/2014/07/13/ap-soc-wcup-final-concussion |archive-date=19 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Second, in the Final, German midfielder [[Christoph Kramer]] received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute.
