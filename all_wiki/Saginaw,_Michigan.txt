==Etymology==

The name Saginaw is widely believed to mean "where the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] were" in [[Ojibwe]], from ''Sace-nong'' or ''Sak-e-nong'' (Sauk Town), due to the belief that the Sauk once lived there. But it is more likely that the name means "place of the outlet", from the Ojibwe ''sag'' (opening) and ''ong'' (place of).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clarke.cmich.edu/localhistory/Saginaw.htm|title=Clarke Home—entral Michigan University|work=cmich.edu}}</ref><ref>[http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-54463_54466_20829-54126--,00.html Michigan Counties.] DNR. Retrieved 2012-11-05.</ref>

When Natives told [[Samuel de Champlain]] that the Sauk nation was on the western shore of [[Lake Michigan]], Champlain mistakenly placed them on the western shore of [[Lake Huron]]. This mistake was copied on subsequent maps, and future references identified this as the place of the Sauks. Champlain himself never visited what is now Michigan.<ref>Saginaw's Changeable Past, by Jeremy W. Kilar, G. Bradley, St. Louis, MO, 1994, p. 15</ref>

==History==

{{Main|History of Saginaw, Michigan}}

===19th century===
====Early history====

The site of what later became the city of Saginaw was originally inhabited by the [[Anishinaabe|Anishnabeg]]. French missionaries and traders first appeared in the area during the late 17th century and encountered the [[Ojibwe|Ojibwe (Chippewa)]] living in the area. The first permanent settlement by those other than Native Americans was in 1816 when [[Louis Campau]] established a trading post on the west bank of the Saginaw River.<ref name=wses>{{cite news|last1=Manning|first1=Nancy Sajdak|title=West Side, East Side|url=http://www.greatlakesbaymag.com/2014/06/west-side-east-side/|access-date=January 22, 2015|work=Great Lakes Bay Magazine|issue=June 2014|publisher=Great Lakes Publishing}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the [[United States]] established Fort Saginaw. Campau's trading post was also inhabited by Metis.

During Michigan's territorial period, a county and township government were organized at Saginaw. Growth of the settlement was fueled rapidly during the 19th century by the lumber industry. Saginaw was the site of numerous sawmills and served as a port for Great Lakes vessels. What is now the city of Saginaw resulted from the consolidation of the cities of East Saginaw and Saginaw City (West Side) in 1889.

====Fort Saginaw====

In 1819, [[Lewis Cass]], in the [[Treaty of Saginaw]], negotiated the prerogative for the [[United States]] to own and settle the area with the leaders of the [[Ojibwe]]. In 1820, Campau attempted to expand across to the east bank of the river but was rejected by the Chippewas. In 1822, the [[United States Army]] established a [[fort]] on the west bank of the [[Saginaw River]] and named it Fort Saginaw. Two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] were stationed at the fort. A group of investors purchased some land near the fort and had it [[plat]]ted under the name, Town of Sagana. Due to the extremely harsh seasons and illnesses, Fort Saginaw was abandoned by 1824.<ref name=wses/>

By the late 1820s, the [[American Fur Company]] was operating a post at Saginaw.

Few plots were sold and after the U.S. Army pulled out, the town languished for most of the following decade. The town was re-platted in December 1830, comprising riverfront from Cass Street, on the south, to Harrison Street, and north to Jefferson. These plots sold slowly. By 1835, only 24 plots had been sold and the remainder were transferred to a new owner, who made another plat in February 1837. However, the financial crisis of the [[Panic of 1837]] dampened interest in purchasing properties. After selling only 58 of the 407 plots, the remainder was sold again in 1841.<ref name="leeson">{{cite book |last=Leeson |first=Michael A. |title=History of Saginaw county, Michigan |orig-year=1881 |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/bad1164.0001.001 |access-date=2007-04-11 |year=2005 |publisher=University of Michigan Library |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |pages=596+}}</ref>

====Native Americans====

Saginaw was the location of the annual government payment to the Ojibwe and Ottawa of the area, starting in the 1830s. This also attracted many French-Canadian and Euro-American merchants, primarily involved in selling watered down whiskey.<ref>''History of Saginaw County, Michigan'' (Chicago: Charles A. Chapman, 1881) p. 122–123</ref>

====Lumber boom====

[[File:Eddy Lumber Docks 1888.jpg|thumb|Eddy Lumber Docks]]

The main cause for the founding and subsequent development of Saginaw was the large demand for lumber as the [[United States]] expanded westward. A virgin growth forest principally consisting of white pine trees covered most of Michigan. The convenient access to transportation provided by the [[Saginaw River]] and its numerous tributaries fueled a massive expansion in population and economic activity. As the trees were being cut down in the region, logs were floated down the rivers to sawmills located in Saginaw, destined to be loaded onto ships and later railroad cars.

[[File:Lumber Docks in Old Saginaw City at Mackinaw Street 1888.jpg|thumb|Lumber Docks in Saginaw City at Mackinaw Street 1888]]

Multiple settlements comprise present-day Saginaw. On the west side of the river the first settlement around what had been Fort Saginaw developed into Saginaw, which was incorporated as a city in 1857, containing the seat of the Saginaw County government. On the east side of the river a parallel settlement, East Saginaw, developed which was incorporated first as a village in 1855, and then as a city in 1859. Also south of East Saginaw, on the east bank of the river, the village of Salina formed. Salina's name relates to the [[brine]] that led to a growing industry of salt production in the area. Both Saginaw and East Saginaw quickly became a hub for railroad transportation in addition to ships on the Saginaw River.

[[File:Pere Marquette Railroad Station on Potter Street 1888.jpg|thumb|Pere Marquette Railroad Station (Potter Street Station) 1888]]

Lumber production peaked by the early 1870s, but had virtually disappeared by the end of the 19th century. In addition to salt production, which experienced an eventual decline as well, growing industries, such as those supporting the area's agriculture and manufacturing, developed.

====Consolidation====

[[File:City Hall built 1890.jpg|thumb|Saginaw City Hall]]

On June 28, 1889, the [[Michigan]] state legislature passed Act 455 to consolidate the cities of Saginaw and [[East Saginaw, Michigan|East Saginaw]] into a single city.<ref name="minutes">{{cite web |url=http://www.saginaw-mi.com/Government/Departments/CityCouncil/Minutes/2005/06-27-05%20Council%20Meeting-NA.doc |title=Minutes of City Council Meeting—June 27, 2005 |access-date=2007-11-29}}</ref><ref name="charter">{{cite web |url=http://www.saginaw-mi.com/Government/charter/preface.php |title=City Charter Preface |access-date=2007-11-29}}</ref> Prior to this consolidation, the nearby village of Salina had already become part of East Saginaw. The consolidation of Saginaw became effective with the election of officers on March 12, 1890.<ref name="charter" />
[[File:Hoyt Public Library in Saginaw.png|thumb|left|The [[Hoyt Library|Hoyt Public Library]], pictured here in June 2006, was built in 1887 by [[Henry Van Brunt#Van Brunt & Howe|Van Brunt & Howe]] of Boston.]]

The provisions of the [[city charter]] were established by the same act of the legislature that provided for the consolidation. Saginaw was to be governed by a [[city council]] consisting of two [[aldermen]] elected from 21 wards and a mainly ceremonial executive [[mayor]] who was to have fairly weak powers. This was to be, as numerous other elected officials, along with elected or appointed boards, controlled much of the administrative and executive functions of government. The efficient and cohesive functioning of the Saginaw city government also was constrained by remaining rivalries between residents, business owners, and politicians from the former two cities. The distinctions and rivalries between Saginaw's east side and west side persisted into the 20th century in various forms, and continues to influence Saginaw's social, political, economic landscape, even into the 2010s.<ref name="rev-150th">{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=Mike |date=June 2007 |title=Saginaw Celebrates its 150th Birthday! |journal=Review Magazine |volume=29 |issue=641 |url=http://review-mag.com/archive/640-649/641/Saginaw150.htm |access-date=2007-11-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022004509/http://www.review-mag.com/archive/640-649/641/Saginaw150.htm |archive-date=2007-10-22 }}</ref>

===20th century===

====Industrialization====

[[File:Saginaw City from Courthouse 1888.jpg|thumb|Saginaw City, looking east from the courthouse towards the river, 1888]]

In the early 20th century, [[automobile]] production proliferated throughout Michigan, but most notably in [[Detroit]]. Other Michigan cities became suppliers to Detroit factories, sometimes with factories of their own. In Saginaw, the Jackson-Church-Wilcox Company began as a partnership in 1906 for producing [[steering]] gear under the "Jacox" brand. Jackson-Church-Wilcox was acquired by [[Buick]] in 1909, and as part of [[General Motors]] became the Jackson, Church and Wilcox Division, the first GM division devoted to parts production. In 1919 the Jacox division was merged with Saginaw Malleable Iron and Central Foundry into GM's Saginaw Products Company. This formed the basis for the Saginaw Steering Gear Division, created in 1928. General Motors and other manufacturers established [[foundries]] and other automobile-related manufacturing facilities in Saginaw, for the production of chemicals and plate glass, as well as metal fabrication. This early development of a symbiotic relationship with the auto industry set the course for the future of the city.<ref name="steering">{{cite web |url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Saginaw_Steering_Division|title=Saginaw Steering Division—Generations of GM|access-date=2012-06-23}}</ref>
[[File:Panorama of downtown Saginaw in 1912.jpg|thumb|Panorama of downtown Saginaw, 1912]]

====New governance====

In 1908, a new [[Michigan Constitution|Michigan state constitution]] was adopted. The new Michigan state constitution mandated increased [[home rule]] powers for local units of government, and the Michigan state legislature enacted the [[Home Rule Cities Act (Michigan)|Home Rule Cities Act]] in 1909. Under this [[statute]], cities were permitted to frame and adopt their own city charters and were given great flexibility in structuring their local governments. The government, under the 1889 charter, had continued to be inefficient and provided for much political infighting. In 1913, a new city charter was adopted with voter approval and which followed a [[City commission government|commission form of city government]] that had gained in popular interest among various cities across the United States in the early 20th century. The new government consisted of five commissioners, each elected separately [[at-large]], who served both as the city council and as the executive heads of various city government departments. One of the commissioners served as the mayor, which was a mostly ceremonial role.
[[File:Downtown Saginaw 1915.jpg|thumb|Downtown Saginaw about 1915]]

The 1913 city charter was followed for little more than two decades when the voters of the city again adopted another new city charter in 1935 following the [[Council-manager government|council-manager form of government]]. The government under the 1913 city charter retained some of the independent boards that were given authority independent of the elected city commissioners. This caused some inefficiency and political friction. The economic consequences of the [[Great Depression]] during the 1930s provided the final catalyst for municipal government reform.

In contrast to the previous government structures, the 1935 charter, having taken effect in 1936, provided for all administration of city government to be headed directly by a single officer, the [[city manager]], who was appointed by, and accountable to a city council of nine members elected as a group by the entire city at-large. The system was designed to address two principal issues with Saginaw's history of municipal government, the inefficiency and politics associated with having executive and administrative authority spread among many different officers and boards, and political rivalries and friction between various geographic areas of the city, mainly the east side and the west side.

====Expansion and growth====

[[File:Aerial View of Downtown Saginaw 1930.jpg|thumb|Aerial View of Downtown Saginaw in 1930]]

During much of the 20th century, Saginaw's economy was dominated by manufacturing related to the automotive industry; most notably, manual transmission assemblies, steering gear boxes and power steering pumps. At the height of manufacturing in the 1960s and 1970s, the city and neighboring Buena Vista Township hosted 12 [[General Motors]] plants, an [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton Manufacturing]] plant (demolished 2008) where 5,000 people produced auto parts,<ref name=White-Shirouzo-Nexteer-2012>{{cite news|last=White|first=Joseph B.|title=In the Heart of the Rust Belt, Chinese Funds Provide the Grease|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203735304577163741272699930|access-date=13 May 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=11 February 2012}}</ref> and numerous smaller concerns.

Before the United States entered [[Allies of World War II|World War II]], Saginaw's industrial complex became directed towards military production. Turning its efforts to the production of [[munitions]], [[weapons|ordnance]] and components for military vehicles made Saginaw a significant contributor to the Allies' victory. Saginaw was home to a production facility that produced [[M1919 Browning machine gun|.30 caliber machine guns]] more quickly and at lower cost than the Army thought possible, armor-piercing shells for anti-tank use,<ref name=Saginaw-WWIIproduction-MBC>{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Dave|title=Why Did U.S. Win WW II?

Migration from across the country, particularly from the [[Southern United States]], drastically increased Saginaw's population during the war years and through the 1950s. This population growth included the expanded presence of African Americans and Latinos in Saginaw. Even before the end of the war, the needs of Saginaw's growth became clear, and were met by significant investment in the city's infrastructure. In 1947, Saginaw and the nearby city of [[Midland, Michigan|Midland]] constructed a {{convert|65|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[water supply]] pipeline drawing water from Whitestone Point in [[Lake Huron]] to meet the anticipated needs of the communities. In addition, the cities of Midland and [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]] joined with Saginaw to develop and operate an airport on the site of a former POW camp in nearby [[Tittabawassee Township]], which eventually became [[MBS International Airport]].

====Post World War II====

In the years following [[World War II]], the Michigan state legislature enacted laws making it increasingly difficult for incorporated cities to expand by annexing territory from neighboring townships. Townships, which had historically served an agrarian, smaller population than that of larger cities, were given the ability to provide nearly all the same services an incorporated city could. Although Midland pursued (and continues to pursue) a policy of "No annexation, no water,"<ref name=MidlandMUGAhistory>{{cite web|title=The Midland Urban Growth Area (MUGA)|url=http://www.midland-mi.org/government/departments/planning/planning/muga.htm|publisher=City of Midland Planning Department|access-date=13 May 2013}}</ref> Saginaw chose to sell water to neighboring communities under long-term contracts. This allowed the townships to further develop at the expense of the city, the limits of which changed little after consolidation in 1989–90. The unintended consequence of this choice was that Saginaw's population stopped growing, new housing development focused on the suburban townships, and businesses eventually followed.

===21st century===

====Population decline====

Manufacturing in Saginaw declined in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to high unemployment in the city. As a result, the city's population diminished dramatically. From 2000 to 2010, the population of Saginaw proper decreased by nearly 10,000. Michigan's population during that period decreased by 0.6% percent, the only U.S. state to lose population during the decade of the 2000s. In addition, Saginaw has faced increasing social problems relating to poverty as a result of its high rate of unemployment. The crime rate has been a major area of concern for the community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census 2010 News U.S. Census Bureau Releases Data on Population Distribution and Change in the U.S. Based on Analysis of 2010|url=http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn124.html|access-date=23 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016002430/http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn124.html|archive-date=16 October 2011}}</ref>

====Unemployment and crime====

Saginaw's economic conditions, compounded by the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]], are a significant area of concern for the city's residents. The decline of manufacturing jobs has resulted in higher than average rates of unemployment. Property values in the city have declined, decreasing the amount the city government collects in property taxes. Unemployment in Saginaw peaked in July 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, standing at 23.5%. The unemployment rate dropped to 9.0% as of April 2015; crime has decreased as unemployment has decreased.

====Combating blight====

Unemployment and population loss in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to [[urban decay|urban blight]], specifically a rise in abandoned homes that provided locations for criminal activity. In recent years, city officials, law enforcement, and neighborhood watch associations have made progress in preventing this activity by heavily patrolling target areas and offering rewards for reporting illegal or suspicious activities.

Efforts to reduce blight in Saginaw increased greatly in 2013, with the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] approving a grant to demolish vacant and abandoned properties via the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. The $100 million grant contained $11.2 million set aside for Saginaw, with Detroit receiving $52.3 million, Flint $20.1 million, [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] $3.7 million, and the final $2.5 million going to [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]].<ref name="Oosting">{{cite web |last=Oosting |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/detroit_to_get_bulk_of_federal.html |title=Detroit, Flint and Saginaw get bulk of federal funds awarded to fight blight in 5 Michigan cities |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2013-08-20 |access-date=2014-01-01}}</ref>

[[Michigan Governor]] [[Rick Snyder]] praised the initiative, saying, "With these federal funds, we'll be able to launch large-scale demolition programs that strike at the blight that is weakening too many neighborhoods in these cities." He added, "This aggressive anti-blight effort will help stabilize neighborhoods that have been struggling for years. As the abandoned properties come down, property values will go up, and crime will go down. That will encourage the people who live in these neighborhoods to stay in their homes and be part of the revitalization of their communities."<ref name="Oosting" />

The Saginaw city government can legally tear down only publicly owned properties, a number that stands above 400. The federal grant provides funds to demolish nearly 950 structures. After the grant's approval, Saginaw city officials announced a program to purchase unwanted, abandoned structures from their owners, which would be then added to the list of homes to tear down. Officials estimate that there are nearly 1,200 privately owned homes within the city limits that are worthy of demolition.<ref name="Tower">{{cite web |last=Tower |first=Mark |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2013/11/sell_your_run-down_house_for_c.html |title=Sell your run-down house in Saginaw for cash: Owners given chance to unload properties |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2013-11-21 |access-date=2014-01-01}}</ref>

Efforts to revitalize downtown increased in 2013. CBS television executive and Saginaw native David Strouse announced an investment plan in late 2013 that would save nearly an entire block of buildings slated for demolition at the intersection of Washington and Genesee, the core of downtown Saginaw. The plan called for the renovation and redevelopment of four buildings, creating market-rate apartments on the upper floors and retail space at ground level. In 2012 a similar deal was made for the Bancroft and Eddy apartments at the same intersection. Once [[Section 8 (housing)|Section{{nbsp}}8]] housing, these buildings are being transformed into market-rate apartments and retail space.<ref name="Tower2">{{cite web |last=Tower |first=Mark |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2013/09/cbs_television_executives_to_d.html |title=CBS Television executive confirms multimillion-dollar plans for historic block in downtown Saginaw |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2013-09-24 |access-date=2014-01-01}}</ref>

====Recent economic development====

Economic development in the region is focused on comparative advantages in innovation, clean energy, and continued manufacturing exports. Compared to other mid-sized communities, Saginaw has a high number of patent applications per job, and more than 81 times the average US share of jobs in photovoltaic technology research and production. The city continues to have a higher proportion of manufacturing jobs than the US average.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/0223_michigan_mid_metros.pdf |title=Info |website=www.brookings.edu }}</ref>

The present Charter was adopted in 1935 and took effect on January 6, 1936. Pursuant to the City Charter, Saginaw is governed by a nine-member elected [[at-large]] Council. The term of office for a member of the [[City Council]] is four years commencing with the first meeting following a regular municipal election. The terms are staggered so the entire Council is not subject to re-election at the same time—either four or five members are elected in each odd-numbered year. The city levies an income tax of 1.5 percent on residents and 0.75 percent on nonresidents.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibbons|first1=Lauren|title=Michigan State University, city of East Lansing at odds over proposed income tax|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/michigan_state_university_city.html |access-date=August 16, 2017 |work=MLive Lansing |publisher=Mlive Media Group |date=August 16, 2017}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

[[File:Saginaw Water Treatment.png|thumb|The Saginaw water treatment facility, pictured here in June 2006, was constructed in 1929.]]

===Utilities===

The City of Saginaw gets its electricity and natural gas from [[Consumers Energy]].

====Municipal water supply====

In 1929, the city opened its consolidated water works plant which replaced two separate plants that were on each side of the Saginaw river. This plant treated water brought in from the Saginaw river and piped it out to the residents as well as corner pumps for people that did not have direct connections to the system.<ref name="saginaw-water2001">{{cite web |url=http://www.saginaw-mi.com/Government/Departments/PublicServices/waterReport2001.pdf |title=Saginaw 2001 Water Report |access-date=2007-11-27}}</ref> Currently, the City of Saginaw jointly owns with the City of Midland the Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation. Incorporated in 1946, this [[water treatment]] system has supplied drinking and industrial water to both cities and many surrounding areas within the county.<ref name="midland-muga">{{cite web |url=http://www.midland-mi.org/government/departments/planning/Planning/muga.htm |title=Planning & Community Development |access-date=2007-11-27}}</ref> Due to brackish water in the aquifers below both cities, a {{convert|65|mi|km|0|adj=mid|-long}} pipeline was constructed in 1948 to supply water from [[Lake Huron]] at White Stone Point, north of [[Au Gres, Michigan|Au Gres]] to water treatment plants in Saginaw and Midland<ref name="saginaw-water2001" /> with a second pipe added by 1996. This system has played a role in the decline of the city. The City of Saginaw, in order to obtain new sources of revenue, sold water to areas outside of the city (especially to the [[Saginaw Charter Township]]). This caused numerous businesses inside the city to leave for the surrounding areas and development in the city to stagnate.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The City of Midland, however, adopted a policy of "No Annexation, No Water" which has led to the growth of the city as well as the surrounding areas.<ref name="midland-muga" />

==Transportation==

Historically, ships were able to move along the length of the river inside the city, but fixed bridges built over the river closed access south of the northern docks.

Saginaw was a railroad hub to the [[Pere Marquette Railway]]. Freight and passenger routes radiated to [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]] to the north, [[Port Huron]] to the east, [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] to the south, [[Grand Rapids]] and [[Chicago]] to the southwest and [[Ludington, Michigan|Ludington]] to the west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.r2parks.net/pmmap.JPG|title=System route map|access-date=23 August 2017}}</ref><ref>Michigan Department of Transportation official rail map http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_Official_Rail_130897_7.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railfanguides.us/mi/saginaw/index.htm|title=Saginaw MI Railfan Guide}}</ref> [[Grand Trunk Railroad]] ran trains from Bay City through Saginaw to Durand, for connections to Chicago, Detroit, Port Huron and Toronto.<ref>''Official Guide of the Railways,'' 1949, Canadian National/Grand Trunk timetables, Tables 95, 146</ref> Most passenger routes were discontinued during the 1950s. The last route to [[Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad East Saginaw Depot|Potter Street Station]] was in 1950. The station was designated a historic site in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://potterstreetstation.com/history/|title=Potter Street Station—This Place Matters—Saginaw Depot Preservation Corporation » History}}</ref> The last [[New York Central Railroad]] train (formerly [[Michigan Central Railroad]]) departed the Genesee Street Station bound for Detroit in 1964. Today, Saginaw hosts the headquarters of the Lake State Railway who continues to operate trains out of the massive former Pere Marquette Saginaw Yard to destinations that include Midland, Bay City and Plymouth. The Huron and Eastern Railroad operates the former GTW mainline through the city, which intersects with Lake State's Midland Line at Mershon Junction. HESR also operates several lines east into the thumb region towards Vassar and Reese. The Mid-Michigan Railroad plays a bit part in the region as well, interchanging with Lake State at Paines, west of the city. The Saginaw Railroad Museum, located on the west side of the city, continues to work towards preservation of the Saginaw Bay area's railroading history.z{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}
