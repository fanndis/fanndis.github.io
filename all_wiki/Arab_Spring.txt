The '''Arab Spring''' ({{lang-ar|الربيع العربي}}) was a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. It began in response to oppressive regimes and a low [[standard of living]], starting with protests in [[Tunisia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/19/uk-tunisia-protests-bouaziziidUKTRE70I7TV20110119|title=Peddler's martyrdom launched Tunisia's revolution|date=19 January 2011|work=Reuters}}{{dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/11/feb/1080.html|title=Uprisings in the region and ignored indicators |website=Payvand}}</ref> From Tunisia, the protests then spread to five other countries: [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], [[Yemen]], [[Syria]], and [[Bahrain]], where either the ruler was deposed ([[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Hosni Mubarak]], and [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]]) or major uprisings and social violence occurred including riots, civil wars, or insurgencies.

A power struggle continued after the immediate response to the Arab Spring. While leadership changed and regimes were held accountable, [[power vacuum]]s opened across the Arab world.

== Etymology ==
The term ''Arab Spring'' is an allusion to the [[Revolutions of 1848]], which are sometimes referred to as the "Springtime of Nations", and the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968. In the aftermath of the [[Iraq War]], it was used by various commentators and bloggers who anticipated a major Arab movement towards [[democratization]].<ref>Krauthammer, Charles (21 March 2005): [http://seattletimes.com/html/opinion/2002214060_krauthammer21.html "The Arab Spring of 2005"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910040039/http://seattletimes.com/html/opinion/2002214060_krauthammer21.html|date=10 September 2013}}.

{{Main|Social media and the Arab Spring}}
In the wake of the Arab Spring protests, a considerable amount of attention focused on the role of social media and digital technologies in allowing citizens within areas affected by "the Arab Uprisings" as a means for collective activism to circumvent state-operated media channels.<ref>{{cite web|title=CNN at SXSW: Social media in Arab Spring|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bSj4f9f8Eg&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1bSj4f9f8Eg|publisher=[[YouTube]]|format=Online video clip|date=12 March 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113000730/http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1bSj4f9f8Eg&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1bSj4f9f8Eg|archivedate=13 January 2015}}</ref> The influence of social media on political activism during the Arab Spring has, however, been much debated.<ref name="ASPO-H-01" /><ref name="ASPO-H-02" /><ref name="Social Media in the Middle East" /> Protests took place both in states with a very high level of Internet usage (such as [[Bahrain]] with 88% of its population online in 2011) and in states with some of the lowest Internet penetration ([[Yemen]] and [[Libya]]).<ref name=Stepanova>{{cite web|last1=Stepanova|first1=Ekaterina|title=The Role of Information Communication Technologies in the "Arab Spring"|url=http://pircenter.org/kosdata/page_doc/p2594_2.pdf|website=Pircenter.org/|access-date=17 May 2015|date=May 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101038/http://pircenter.org/kosdata/page_doc/p2594_2.pdf|archivedate=18 May 2015}}</ref>

The use of social media platforms more than doubled in Arab countries during the protests, with the exception of Libya.<ref name="Salem, Fadi, Mourtada" /> Some researchers have shown how [[collective intelligence]], [[Crowd psychology|dynamics of the crowd]] in [[Participatory design#In software development|participatory systems]] such as social media, has immense power to support a collective action—such as foment a political change.<ref name="ASPO-H-03" /><ref name="ASPO-H-04" /> {{As of|2011|04|05}}, the number of Facebook users in the Arab world surpassed 27.7 million people.<ref name="Salem, Fadi, Mourtada" /> Some critics have argued that digital technologies and other forms of communication—videos, cellular phones, blogs, photos, emails, and text messages—have brought about the concept of a "digital democracy" in parts of North Africa affected by the uprisings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wellman|first1=Barry|last2=Rainie|first2=Lee|title=Networked|date=2014|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Boston, MA|page=207}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2011/social_medias/EN/index.htm|title=Archived copy|access-date=2 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610184900/http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2011/social_medias/EN/index.htm|archivedate=10 June 2016}}</ref>

Social media sites were a platform for different movements formed by many frustrated citizens, including the 2008 "April 6 Youth Movement" organized by Ahmed Mahed, which set out to organize and promote a nationwide labor strike and which inspired the later creation of the "Progressive Youth of Tunisia".<ref name="Networked">{{cite book|last1=Wellman|first1=Barry|last2=Rainie|first2=Lee|title=Networked|date=2014|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Boston, MA|page=208}}</ref>

During the Arab Spring, people created [[List of Facebook features|pages]] on Facebook to raise awareness about alleged crimes against humanity, such as police brutality in the Egyptian Revolution (see [[Wael Ghonim]] and [[Death of Khaled Mohamed Saeed]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellen|first=Roger|date=2013|title=Modern Arab Uprisings and Social Media: An Historical Perspective on Media and Revolution|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology}}</ref> Whether the project of raising awareness was primarily pursued by Arabs themselves or simply advertised by Western social media users is a matter of debate. Jared Keller, a journalist for [[The Atlantic]], claims that most activists and protesters used Facebook (among other social media) to organize; however, what influenced Iran was "good old-fashioned word of mouth". Jared Keller argued that the sudden and anomalous social media output was caused from Westerners witnessing the situation(s), and then broadcasting them. The Middle East and North Africa used texting, emailing, and blogging only to organize and communicate information about internal local protests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/06/evaluating-irans-twitter-revolution/58337/|title=Evaluating Iran's Twitter Revolution|last=Keller|first=Jared|date=18 June 2010|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=4 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117195744/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/06/evaluating-irans-twitter-revolution/58337/|archivedate=17 January 2016}}</ref>

A study by [[Zeynep Tufekci]] of the University of North Carolina and Christopher Wilson of the United Nations Development Program concluded that "social media in general, and Facebook in particular, provided new sources of information the regime could not easily control and were crucial in shaping how citizens made individual decisions about participating in protests, the logistics of protest, and the likelihood of success."<ref name="Arab Spring 2013">"Debate flares on 'Twitter revolutions,' Arab Spring."

In the months leading up to events in Tunisia, [[Department of Homeland Security]], [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]], Communications Program Manager Jonathan Stevens predicted the use of "collaborative Internet utilities" to effect governmental change. In his thesis, [http://sdsu-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.10/608/Stevens_Jonathan.pdf Webeaucracy: The Collaborative Revolution], Stevens put forth that unlike writing, printing, and telecommunications, "collaborative Internet utilities" denote a sea-change in the ability of crowds to effect social change. People and collaborative Internet utilities can be described as actor-networks; the [[subitizing]] limit (and history) suggests people left to their own devices cannot fully harness the mental power of crowds. [[Metcalfe's law]] suggests that as the number of nodes increases, the value of collaborative actor-networks increases exponentially; collaborative Internet utilities effectively increase the subitizing limit, and, at some macro scale, these interactive collaborative actor-networks can be described by the same rules that govern [[Parallel Distributed Processing]], resulting in crowd sourcing that acts as a type of distributed collective consciousness. The Internet assumes the role of totemic religious figurehead uniting the members of society through mechanical solidarity forming a collective consciousness. Through many-to-many collaborative Internet utilities, the [[Webeaucracy]] is empowered as never before.<ref name="Webeaucracy: The Collaborative Revolution">{{cite web|url=http://sdsu-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.10/608/Stevens_Jonathan.pdf |work=Thesis at San Diego State University |last=Stevens |first=Jonathan |date=20 October 2010 |title=Webeaucracy: The Collaborative Revolution}}</ref>

Social networks were not the only instrument for rebels to coordinate their efforts and communicate. In the countries with the lowest Internet penetration and the limited role of social networks, such as [[Yemen]] and [[Libya]], the role of mainstream electronic media devices—cellular phones, emails, and video clips (e.g., [[YouTube]])—was very important to cast the light on the situation in the country and spread the word about the protests in the outside world.<ref name=Stepanova /> In [[Egypt]], in [[Cairo]] particularly, [[mosque]]s were one of the main platforms to coordinate the protest actions and raise awareness to the masses.<ref name=Demidov>{{cite journal|last1=Demidov|first1=Oleg|title=Social Networks in International and National Security|journal=Security Index|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=22–36|doi=10.1080/19934270.2012.634122|issn=1993-4270}}<!--|accessdate=17 May 2015--></ref>

Conversely, scholarship literature on the Middle East, political scientist Gregory Gause has found, had failed to predict the events of the Arab uprisings. Commenting on an early article by Gause whose review of a decade of Middle Eastern studies led him to conclude that almost no scholar foresaw what was coming, Chair of Ottoman and Turkish Studies at Tel Aviv University Ehud R. Toledano writes that Gause's finding is "a strong and sincere ''mea culpa''" and that his criticism of Middle East experts for "underestimating the hidden forces driving change ... while they worked instead to explain the unshakable stability of repressive authoritarian regimes" is well-placed. Toledano then quotes Gause saying, "As they wipe the egg off their faces," those experts "need to reconsider long-held assumptions about the Arab world."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dayan.org/file-download/download/public/11620|title=Middle East Historians and the Arab Spring: Early-Days Assessment|year=2011|publisher=Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies (MDC)|access-date=2 April 2019}}</ref>

== Timeline ==
{{Main|Timeline of the Arab Spring}}

== Events leading up to the Arab Spring ==
[[Tunisia]] experienced a series of conflicts during the three years leading up to the Arab Spring, the most notable occurring in the mining area of [[Gafsa]] in 2008, where protests continued for many months. These protests included rallies, sit-ins, and strikes, during which there were two fatalities, an unspecified number of wounded, and dozens of arrests.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name="Tunisian government faces growing dissent in mining region" />

In [[Egypt]], the labor movement had been strong for years, with more than 3,000 labor actions since 2004, and provided an important venue for organizing protests and collective action.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> One important demonstration was an attempted workers' strike on 6 April 2008 at the state-run textile factories of [[El Mahalla El Kubra|al-Mahalla al-Kubra]], just outside [[Cairo]]. The idea for this type of demonstration spread throughout the country, promoted by computer-literate working-class youths and their supporters among middle-class college students.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> A Facebook page, set up to promote the strike, attracted tens of thousands of followers and provided the platform for sustained political action in pursuit of the "long revolution".<ref name="Digital Dissidence Political Change: Cyberactivism and Citizen Journalism in Egypt" /> The government mobilized to break the strike through infiltration and riot police, and while the regime was somewhat successful in forestalling a strike, dissidents formed the "6 April Committee" of youths and labor activists, which became one of the major forces calling for the anti-[[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] demonstration on 25 January in [[Tahrir Square]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />

In [[Algeria]], discontent had been building for years over a number of issues. In February 2008, US Ambassador Robert Ford wrote in a leaked diplomatic cable that [[Algeria]] is "unhappy" with long-standing political alienation; that social discontent persisted throughout the country, with food strikes occurring almost every week; that there were demonstrations every day somewhere in the country; and that the Algerian government was corrupt and fragile.<ref name="07ALGIERS1806" /> Some claimed that during 2010 there were as many as "9,700 riots and unrests" throughout the country.<ref name="army_should_quit" /> Many protests focused on issues such as education and health care, while others cited rampant corruption.<ref name="Political Crises but Few Alternatives in Algeria" />

In Western Sahara, the [[Gdeim Izik protest camp]] was erected {{convert|12|km|mi}} southeast of [[Laayoune|El Aaiún]] by a group of young [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawis]] on 9 October 2010. Their intention was to demonstrate against labor discrimination, unemployment, looting of resources, and human rights abuses.<ref name="Ref-1" /> The camp contained between 12,000 and 20,000 inhabitants, but on 8 November 2010 it was destroyed and its inhabitants evicted by Moroccan security forces. The security forces faced strong opposition from some young Sahrawi civilians, and rioting soon spread to El Aaiún and other towns within the territory, resulting in an unknown number of injuries and deaths. Violence against Sahrawis in the aftermath of the protests was cited as a reason for [[2011 Western Saharan protests|renewed protests]] months later, after the start of the Arab Spring.<ref name="Saharawi protests, violence and blackmail Moroccan" />

The catalyst for the escalation of protests was the self-immolation of Tunisian [[Mohamed Bouazizi]]. Unable to find work and selling fruit at a roadside stand, Bouazizi had his wares confiscated by a municipal inspector on 17 December 2010. An hour later he doused himself with gasoline and set himself afire. His death on 4 January 2011<ref name="Tunisia suicide protester Mohammed Bouazizi dies" /> brought together various groups dissatisfied with the existing system, including many unemployed persons, political and human rights activists, labor and trade unionists, students, professors, lawyers, and others to begin the [[Tunisian Revolution]].<ref name="autogenerated2" />

== The Arab Spring ==
The series of protests and demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa that commenced in 2010 became known as the "Arab Spring",<ref name="Egypt protests: an Arab spring as old order crumbles" /><ref name="The Arab spring requires a defiantly European reply" /><ref name="Arab Spring – Who lost Egypt?" /> and sometimes as the "Arab Spring and Winter",<ref name="What Is Palestine's Next Move in the New Middle East?" /> "Arab Awakening",<ref name="The Arab awakening – Spotlight" /><ref name="Arab Awakening?" /><ref name="The Arab awakening reaches Syria" /> or "Arab Uprisings",<ref name="Arab Uprisings: What the 20 February Protests Tell Us About Morocco" /><ref name="Democracy's hard spring" /> even though not all the participants in the protests were [[Arabs|Arab]]. It was sparked by the first protests that occurred in [[Tunisia]] on 18 December 2010 in Sidi Bouzid, following [[Mohamed Bouazizi]]'s [[self-immolation]] in protest of police corruption and ill treatment.<ref name="Slap to a Man's Pride Set Off Tumult in Tunisia" /><ref name="Peddler's martyrdom launched Tunisia's revolution" /> With the success of the protests in Tunisia, a [[revolutionary wave|wave of unrest]] sparked by the [[Mohamed Bouazizi|Tunisian "Burning Man"]] struck [[Algeria]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], and [[Yemen]],<ref name="Inspired by Tunisia and Egypt, Yemenis join in anti-government protests" /> then spread to other countries. The largest, most organized demonstrations often occurred on a "day of rage", usually Friday afternoon prayers.<ref name="arabnews" /><ref name="Police in south Yemen disperse 'day of rage' protests" /><ref name="Bahrain moves to foil anti-government rallies" /> The protests also triggered similar unrest [[Impact of the Arab Spring|outside the region]]. Contrary to expectations the revolutions were not led by Islamists:

{{quote|Even though the Islamists were certainly present during the uprisings, they never determined the directions of these movements—after all, there was hardly any central leadership in any of the uprisings. Some Islamist groups initially were even reluctant to join in the protests, and the major religious groups in Egypt—Salafis, al-Azhar, and the Coptic Church—initially opposed the revolution. The mufti of Egypt, Ali Gomaa, proclaimed that rising against a lawful ruler—President Mubarak—was ''haram'', not permissible. And the Muslim Brotherhood's old guard joined in the protests reluctantly only after being pushed by the group's young people.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QQmDwAAQBAJ&q=rachid%20al-ghannouchi%20rebellion%20against%20the%20ruler&pg=PT189|title=Revolution without Revolutionaries: Making Sense of the Arab Spring|last=Bayat|first=Asef|date=2017|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-1-5036-0258-8|language=en-US}}</ref>}}

Tunisian President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] fled to Saudi Arabia on 14 January 2011 following the [[Tunisian Revolution]] protests. Egyptian [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] resigned on 11 February 2011 after 18 days of massive protests, ending his 30-year presidency. The [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was overthrown on 23 August 2011, after the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) took control of [[Bab al-Azizia]]. He was killed on 20 October 2011 in his hometown of [[Sirte]] after the NTC took control of the city. Yemeni President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] signed the GCC power-transfer deal in which a presidential election was held, resulting in his successor [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]] formally replacing him as president on 27 February 2012 in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

During this period, several leaders announced their intentions to step down at the end of their current terms. [[Sudan]]ese President [[Omar al-Bashir]] announced that he would not seek reelection in 2015 (he ultimately retracted his announcement and ran anyway),<ref name="Party: Bashir is not standing for re-election" /> as did [[Iraq]]i Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]], whose term was to end in 2014,<ref name="Iraq PM plans no re-election" /> although there were violent demonstrations demanding his immediate resignation in 2011.<ref name="Iraq angered protesters call for Maliki resignation" /> Protests in [[Jordan]] also caused the sacking of four successive governments<ref name="Jordanians stage anti-gov't sit-in in Amman" /><ref name="aljazeera2" /> by [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah]].<ref name="Jordan king appoints new PM, government quits" /> The popular unrest in [[Kuwait]] also resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister [[Nasser Al-Sabah]]'s cabinet.<ref name="Kuwait's prime minister resigns after protests" />

Inspired by the uprising in Tunisia and prior to his entry as a central figure in Egyptian politics, potential [[2011 Egyptian presidential election|presidential candidate]] [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] warned of a "Tunisia-style explosion" in Egypt.<ref name="Warning Egypt could follow Tunisia" />

Protests in Egypt began on 25 January 2011 and ran for 18 days. Beginning around midnight on 28 January, the Egyptian government attempted, somewhat successfully, to eliminate the nation's Internet access,<ref name="Analysis of Egyptian and Libyan outages" /> in order to inhibit the protesters' ability to use [[media activism]] to organize through [[social media]].<ref name="Egypt: AP Confirms Government has Disrupted Internet Service" /> Later that day, as tens of thousands protested on the streets of Egypt's major cities, President [[Hosni Mubarak]] dismissed his government, later appointing a new cabinet.

=== Libya (2011) ===
{{Main|Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Crisis (2011–present)}}
[[File:Demonstration in Al Bayda (Libya, 2011-07-22).jpg|thumb|Thousands of demonstrators gather in [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]].]]
Anti-government protests began in Libya on 15 February 2011. By 18 February, the opposition controlled most of [[Benghazi]], the country's second-largest city. The government dispatched elite troops and militia in an attempt to recapture it, but they were repelled. By 20 February, protests had spread to the capital [[Tripoli]], leading to a television address by [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], who warned the protestors that their country could descend into civil war. The rising death toll, numbering in the thousands, drew international condemnation and resulted in the resignation of several Libyan diplomats, along with calls for the government's dismantlement.<ref name="HIGHLIGHTS – Libyan TV address by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi" />

Amidst ongoing efforts by demonstrators and rebel forces to wrest control of Tripoli from the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Jamahiriya]], the opposition set up an [[National Transitional Council|interim government]] in Benghazi to oppose Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s rule.<ref name="Ex Libyan minister forms interim govt-report" /> However, despite initial opposition success, government forces subsequently took back much of the Mediterranean coast.

On 17 March, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] was adopted, authorising a [[no-fly zone]] over Libya, and "all necessary measures" to protect civilians. Two days later, France, the United States and the United Kingdom [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened in Libya]] with a bombing campaign against pro-Gaddafi forces. A coalition of 27 states from Europe and the Middle East soon joined the intervention. The forces were driven back from the outskirts of Benghazi, and the rebels [[First Gulf of Sidra offensive|mounted an offensive]], capturing scores of towns across the coast of Libya. The offensive stalled however, and a counter-offensive by the government retook most of the towns, until a [[Battle of Brega–Ajdabiya road|stalemate]] was formed between [[Brega]] and [[Ajdabiya]], the former being held by the government and the latter in the hands of the rebels. Focus then shifted to the west of the country, where bitter fighting continued. After a [[Battle of Misrata|three-month-long battle]], a loyalist siege of rebel-held [[Misrata]], the third largest city in Libya, was broken in large part due to coalition air strikes. The four major fronts of combat were generally considered to be the [[Nafusa Mountains]], the [[Tripolitania]]n coast, the [[Gulf of Sirte|Gulf of Sidra]],<ref name="Rebels wage a secret night-time war on the streets of Tripoli" /> and the southern [[Libyan Desert]].<ref name="Rebels Move Toward Gadhafi Stronghold" />

In late August, anti-Gaddafi fighters [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|captured]] [[Tripoli]], scattering Gaddafi's government and marking the end of his 42 years of power. Many institutions of the government, including Gaddafi and several top government officials, regrouped in [[Sirte]], which Gaddafi declared to be Libya's new capital.<ref name="From voice said to be Gadhafi, a defiant message to his foes" /> Others fled to [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], [[Bani Walid]], and remote reaches of the [[Libyan Desert]], or to surrounding countries.<ref name="Gaddafi loyalists flee Sebha to Niger" /><ref name="Rebels to seek return of Gaddafi family from Algeria" /> However, Sabha [[Battle of Sabha|fell]] in late September,<ref name="hurriyetdailynews" /> Bani Walid was captured after a [[Battle of Bani Walid|grueling siege]] weeks later,<ref name="Libya conflict: NTC forces claim Bani Walid victory" /> and on 20 October, fighters under the aegis of the [[National Transitional Council]] [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|seized]] Sirte, [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|killing Gaddafi]] in the process.<ref name="Qaddafi dead after Sirte battle, PM confirms" /> However, after Gaddafi was killed, the [[Libyan Crisis (2011–present)|Civil War]] continued.

Protests in Syria started on 26 January 2011, when a police officer assaulted a man in public at "Al-Hareeka Street" in old Damascus. The man was arrested right after the assault. As a result, protesters called for the freedom of the arrested man.

Thousands of protesters gathered in [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[al-Hasakah]], [[Daraa]], [[Deir ez-Zor]], and [[Hama]] on 15 March,<ref name="alarabiya" /><ref name="sawtbeirut" /> with recently released politician [[Suheir Atassi|Suhair Atassi]] becoming an unofficial spokesperson for the "Syrian revolution".<ref name="bbc5" /> The next day there were reports of approximately 3000 arrests and a few casualties, but there are no official figures on the number of deaths.<ref name="sawtbeirut6" /> On 18 April 2011, approximately 100,000 protesters sat in the central Square of Homs calling for the resignation of President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Protests continued through July 2011, the government responding with harsh security clampdowns and military operations in several districts, especially in the north.<ref name="In Syria, Opposition Stages Massive Protests" />

On 31 July, Syrian army tanks stormed several cities, including Hama, Deir Ez-Zour, [[Abu Kamal]], and [[al-Hirak, Syria|Herak]] near Daraa. At least 136 people were killed, the highest death toll in any day since the start of the uprising.<ref name="Syria's Ramadan massacre" /> On 5 August 2011, an anti-government demonstration took place in Syria called "God is with us", during which the Syrian security forces shot the protesters from inside the ambulances, killing 11 people consequently.<ref name="alarabiya7" />

Following the self-immolation of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] in [[Sidi Bouzid]], a series of increasingly violent street demonstrations through December 2010 ultimately led to the ousting of longtime [[President of Tunisia|President]] [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] on 14 January 2011. The demonstrations were preceded by high unemployment, [[food]] [[inflation]], corruption,<ref name="Tunisia riots: Reform or be overthrown, US tells Arab states amid fresh riots" /> lack of [[freedom of speech]] and other forms of [[political freedom]],<ref name="Tunisia's bitter cyberwar" /> and poor [[Habitability|living conditions]]. The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades<ref name="protestwave" /><ref name="Tunisian president vows to punish rioters after worst unrest in a decade" /> and resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators. Ben Ali fled into exile in [[Saudi Arabia]], ending his 23 years in power.<ref name="autogenerated4" /><ref name="Uprising in Tunisia: People Power topples Ben Ali regime" />

A [[state of emergency]] was declared and a caretaker coalition government was created following Ben Ali's departure, which included members of Ben Ali's party, the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally|Constitutional Democratic Rally]] (RCD), as well as opposition figures from other ministries. The five newly appointed non-RCD ministers resigned almost immediately.<ref name="threeministers" /><ref name="aljaz_protests_21jan" /> As a result of continued daily protests, on 27 January Prime Minister [[Mohamed Ghannouchi]] reshuffled the government, removing all former RCD members other than himself, and on 6 February the former ruling party was suspended;<ref name="Tunisian minister suspends ex-ruling party" /> later, on 9 March, it was dissolved.<ref name="dissolution" /> Following further public protests, Ghannouchi himself resigned on 27 February, and [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] became Prime Minister.

Although the long-term effects of the Arab Spring have yet to be shown, its short-term consequences varied greatly across the Middle East and North Africa. In Tunisia and Egypt, where the existing regimes were ousted and replaced through a process of free and fair election, the revolutions were considered short-term successes.<ref name="Demystifying the Arab Spring">{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Lisa|title=Demystifying the Arab Spring: Parsing the Differences Between Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=May 2011|volume=90|issue=3|pages=2–7}}</ref><ref name="The Arab Spring Revisited">{{cite journal|last1=Haseeb|first1=Khair El-Din|title=The Arab Spring Revisited|journal=Contemporary Arab Affairs|date=13 March 2012|volume=5|issue=2|pages=185–197|doi=10.1080/17550912.2012.673384}}</ref><ref name="What Explains Successful Protest Cascades?">{{cite journal|last1=Hussain|first1=Muzammil M|last2=Howard|first2=Philip N|title=What Explains Successful Protest Cascades?

Elsewhere, most notably in the monarchies of Morocco and the [[Persian Gulf]], existing regimes co-opted the Arab Spring movement and managed to maintain order without significant social change.<ref name="Reconsidering the Robustness of Authoritarianism in the Middle East">{{cite journal|last1=Bellin|first1=Eva|title=Reconsidering the Robustness of Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Lessons from the Arab Spring|journal=Comparative Politics|date=January 2012|volume=44|issue=2|pages=127–149|jstor=23211807|doi=10.5129/001041512798838021}}</ref><ref name="Morocco: Smart Authoritarianism Refined">{{cite book|last1=Kausch|first1=Kristina|editor1-last=Emerson|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Youngs|editor2-first=Richard|title=Democracy's Plight in the European Neighbourhood: Struggling Transitions and Proliferating Dynasties|date=2009|publisher=Centre for European Policy Studies|location=Brussels|isbn=9789290799269|pages=140–147|chapter=Morocco: Smart Authoritarianism Refined}}</ref> In other countries, particularly Syria and Libya, the apparent result of Arab Spring protests was a complete [[societal collapse]].<ref name="Demystifying the Arab Spring" />

Social scientists have endeavored to understand the circumstances that led to this variation in outcome. A variety of causal factors have been highlighted, most of which hinge on the relationship between the strength of the state and the strength of civil society. Countries with stronger civil society networks in various forms underwent more successful reforms during the Arab Spring; these findings are also consistent with more general social science theories such as those espoused by [[Robert D. Putnam]] and [[Joel S. Migdal]].<ref name="Strong Societies and Weak States">{{cite book|last1=Migdal|first1=Joel S|title=Strong Societies and Weak States: State-Society Relations and State Capabilities in the Third World|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-01073-1}}</ref><ref name="Bowling Alone">{{cite book|last1=Putnam|first1=Robert D|title=Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community|date=2001|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7432-0304-3}}</ref>

One of the primary influences that have been highlighted in the analysis of the Arab Spring is the relative strength or weakness of a society's formal and informal [[institution]]s prior to the revolts. When the Arab Spring began, Tunisia had an established infrastructure and a lower level of petty corruption than did other states, such as Libya.<ref name="Demystifying the Arab Spring" /> This meant that, following the overthrow of the existing regime, there was less work to be done in reforming Tunisian institutions than elsewhere, and consequently it was less difficult to transition to and consolidate a democratic system of government.<ref name="Reconsidering the Robustness of Authoritarianism in the Middle East" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=North|first1=Douglass C|title=Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance|date=1992|publisher=ICS Press|location=San Francisco|page=13}}</ref>

Also crucial was the degree of state censorship over print, broadcast, and social media in different countries. Television coverage by channels like [[Al Jazeera]] and [[BBC News]] provided worldwide exposure and prevented mass violence by the Egyptian government in Tahrir Square, contributing to the success of the Egyptian Revolution. In other countries, such as Libya, Bahrain, and Syria, such international press coverage was not present to the same degree, and the governments of these countries were able to act more freely in suppressing the protests.<ref>Hearns-Branaman, Jesse Owen (2012), 'The Egyptian Revolution did not take place: On live television coverage by Al Jazeera English', ''[[International Journal of Baudrillard Studies]]'' Vol 9, no 1 {{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-9_1/v9-1-branaman.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=17 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321094852/http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-9_1/v9-1-branaman.html|archivedate=21 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="YEAR IN PICTURES: Arab Spring" /> Strong authoritarian regimes with high degrees of censorship in their national broadcast media were able to block communication and prevent the domestic spread of information necessary for successful protests.

The support, even if tacit, of national military forces during protests has also been correlated to the success of the Arab Spring movement in different countries.<ref name="The Arab Spring Revisited" /><ref name="Reconsidering the Robustness of Authoritarianism in the Middle East" /> In Egypt and Tunisia, the military actively participated in ousting the incumbent regime and in facilitating the transition to democratic elections. Countries like Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, exhibited a strong mobilization of military force against protesters, effectively ending the revolts in their territories; others, including Libya and Syria, failed to stop the protests entirely and instead ended up in civil war.<ref name="The Arab Spring Revisited" /> The support of the military in Arab Spring protests has also been linked to the degree of ethnic homogeneity in different societies. In Saudi Arabia and Syria, where the ruling elite was closely linked with ethnic or religious subdivisions of society, the military sided with the existing regime and took on the ostensible role of protector to minority populations.<ref name="Why Middle East Studies Missed the Arab Spring">{{cite journal|last1=Gause III|first1=F.

Some trends in political Islam resulting from the Arab Spring noted by observers (Quinn Mecham and Tarek Osman) include:
*[[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt#After the July 2013 overthrow of Mohamed Morsi|Repression]] of the Muslim Brotherhood, not only in Egypt by the military and courts following the forcible removal of [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|Morsi from office in 2013]]; but also by Saudi Arabia and a number of Gulf countries (not Qatar).<ref name=Mecham>{{cite news|last1=Mecham|first1=Quinn|title=The evolution of Islamism since the Arab uprisings|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/24/the-evolution-of-islamism-since-the-arab-uprisings/|access-date=28 October 2015|agency=Washington Post|date=24 October 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012165755/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/24/the-evolution-of-islamism-since-the-arab-uprisings/|archivedate=12 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=brookings>{{cite web|title=Rethinking Political Islam |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports2/2015/08/rethinking-political-islam|website=brookings.edu|publisher=Brookings|access-date=29 October 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028184139/http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports2/2015/08/rethinking-political-islam|archivedate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref name="Islam Hassan">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12696782|title=GCC's 2014 Crisis: Causes, Issues and Solutions|journal=Gulf Cooperation Council's Challenges and Prospects|author=Islam Hassan|date=31 March 2015|publisher=Al Jazeera Research Center|access-date=4 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904020157/http://www.academia.edu/12696782/GCCs_2014_Crisis_Causes_Issues_and_Solutions|archivedate=4 September 2015}}</ref> The ambassadors crisis also seriously threatened the GCC's activities, adversely affected its functioning and could arguably even have led to its dissolution.<ref name="Islam Hassan" />
*Rise of Islamist "[[state-building]]" where "state failure" has taken place—most prominently in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. Islamists have found it easier than competing non-Islamists trying to fill the void of state failure, by securing external funding, weaponry and fighters – "many of which have come from abroad and have rallied around a pan-Islamic identity". The norms of governance in these Islamist areas are militia-based, and the governed submit to their authority out of fear, loyalty, other reasons, or some combination.<ref name=Mecham /> The "most expansive" of these new "models" is the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]].<ref name=Mecham />
*Increasing sectarianism (primarily Sunni-Shia) at least in part from [[proxy war]]s and the escalation of the [[Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict]]. Islamists are fighting Islamists across sectarian lines in Lebanon (Sunni militants targeting [[Hezbollah]] positions), Yemen (between mainstream Sunni Islamists of [[Al-Islah (Yemen)|al-Islah]] and the Shiite [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi]] [[Houthis|Houthi]] movement), in Iraq (Islamic State and Iraqi Shiite militias)<ref name=Mecham />
*Increased caution and political learning in countries such as Algeria and Jordan where Islamists have chosen not to lead a major challenge against their governments. In Yemen, [[Al-Islah (Yemen)|al-Islah]] "has sought to frame its ideology in a way that will avoid charges of militancy".<ref name=Mecham />
*In countries where Islamists did choose to lead a major challenge and did not succeed in transforming society (particularly Egypt), a disinterest in "soul-searching" about what went wrong, in favor of "antagonism and fiery anger" and a thirst for revenge. Partisans of political Islam (although this does not include some prominent leaders such as [[Rached Ghannouchi]] but is particularly true in Egypt) see themselves as victims of an injustice whose perpetrators are not just "individual conspirators but entire social groups".<ref name="osman-2016-244">{{cite book|last1=Osman|first1=Tarek|title=Islamism: What It Means for the Middle East and the World|date=2016|publisher=Yale University Press|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vKZ5CwAAQBAJ&q=islamism+osman|access-date=18 October 2016|isbn=978-0-300-19772-3}}</ref>

Contrary to the common discourse, Hussein Agha and Robert Malley from [[The New Yorker]] argue that the divide in the post-Arab Spring in the Middle East is not sectarianism:

{{quote|The bloodiest, most vicious, and most pertinent struggles occur squarely inside the Sunni world. Sectarianism is a politically expedient fable, conveniently used to cover up old-fashioned power struggles, maltreatment of minorities, and cruel totalitarian practices.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Agha|first1=Hussein|last2=Malley|first2=Robert|title=''The Middle East's Great Divide is not Sectarianism''|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-middle-easts-great-divide-is-not-sectarianism/amp|access-date=31 March 2019|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=11 March 2019}}</ref>}}

Agha and Malley point out that even in Syria there has been a misrepresentation of the conflict, that the [[Assad regime]] relied on an alliance that included middle class Sunnis along with other religious minorities. Prior to the uprising, the Syrian regime enjoyed some financial and political support from Sunni [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]]. The "select rich urban bourgeoisie, the Sunni Damascene in particular", according to Tokyo University researcher Housam Darwisheh, "now has a direct interest in preserving stability and their relations with the regime as long as their businesses prosper."<ref>{{cite web|last=Darwisheh|first=Housam|url=https://ir.ide.go.jp/index.php?action=pages_view_main&active_action=repository_action_common_download&item_id=37785&item_no=1&attribute_id=22&file_no=1&page_id=39&block_id=158|title=''From Authoritarianism to Upheaval: the Political Economy of the Syrian Uprising and Regime Persistence|year=2013|publisher=Institute of Developing Economics, Japan|access-date=31 March 2019}}</ref> In the view of the Arab sociologist [[Halim Barakat]], "the persistence of communal cleavages complicates rather than nullifies social class consciousness and struggles."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/eBooks/MidEast/BOOKS/The%20Arab%20World%20Barakat.pdf |last=Barakat|first=Halim|title=''The Arab World: Society, Culture and State''|publisher=Berkeley, University of California Press|year=1993|page=19}}</ref>

== Arab Spring: Revolution or reform ==
Very few analysts of the Arab societies foresaw a mass movement on such a scale that might threaten the existing order. In his 1993 sociological study of the Arab societies, culture and state, Barakat stated confidently that "one should expect the first Arab popular revolution to take place in Egypt or Tunisia. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that revolutions may occur in more pluralistic societies as well."{{sfn|Barakat|1993|pages=15–17}} What was prevalent, according to the Syrian writer and political dissident [[Yassin al-Haj Saleh]] was three 'springs' that ensured the status quo. One of which was a "spring of despotic states that receive assistance and legitimacy from a world system centered around stability".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yassinhs.com/2016/02/19/syria-and-the-world-reactionarism-is-back-and-progressing|last=al-Haj Saleh|first=Yassin|date=19 February 2016|access-date=15 April 2019|title=Syria and the World: Reactionarism is Back, and Progressing}}</ref> Most democracy protests do not result in reforms.<ref>Dawn Brancati. 2016.

Two months into the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings, ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine in a leader article spoke about a new generation of young people, idealists, "inspired by democracy" made revolutions. Those revolutions, the article stated, "are going the right way, with a hopeful new mood prevailing and free elections in the offing".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2011/03/31/islam-and-the-arab-revolutions|title=Islam and the Arab revolutions|date=31 March 2011|magazine=The Economist|accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> For those on the streets of Egypt the predominant slogan was "bread, freedom and social justice".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediterraneanaffairs.com/bread-freedom-and-social-justice|title=Bread, freedom and social justice|publisher=Mediterranean Affairs|date=5 February 2015|access-date=16 April 2019}}</ref>

Some observers, however, have questioned the revolutionary nature of the 'Arab Spring'. A social theorist specialising in social movements and social change in the Middle East, [[Asef Bayat]], has provided an analysis based on his decades-long of research as "a participant-observer" (his own words). In his appraisal of the Arab revolutions, Bayat discerns a remarkable difference between these revolutions and the revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s in countries like Yemen, [[Nicaragua]] and Iran. The Arab revolutions, argues Bayat, "lacked any associated intellectual anchor" and the predominant voices, "secular and Islamists alike, took free market, property relations, and neoliberal rationality for granted" and uncritically.<ref name="Bayat">{{Cite book|title=Revolution without Revolutionaries: Making Sense of the Arab Spring|last=Bayat|first=Asef|date=2017|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-1-5036-0258-8|language=en-US|pages=11}}</ref> New social movements' define themselves as horizontal networks with aversion to the state and central authority.

According to Cambridge sociologist Hazem Kandil, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] did not aim at taking power during the events leading up to the toppling of Mubarak. The biggest and most organised organisation in Egypt in fact negotiated with the regime in "infamous talks between [[Morsi]] and the then vice-president [[Omar Suleiman]]", and "an informal deal was reached: withdraw your members from Tahrir Square, and we allow you to form a political party." Then the Brotherhood wavered whether to file a presidential candidate and did not push for a new constitution, choosing to work with the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] (SCAF):

{{quote|The Brotherhood and the Salafists went all-out to keep the existing constitution—originating under Sadat— with a few amendments. The result was irrelevant, because the military scrapped the old constitution anyway. But the Brothers managed to persuade over 70 per cent of the voters, so it became clear to the military that they had far more sway on the street than the secular revolutionaries who had brought down Mubarak, yet seemed incapable of much organization once they had done so. For SCAF, the priority was to bring the street under control, so it decided to start working with the Brotherhood to stabilize the country.<ref>{{cite journal|last=kandil|first=Hazem|url=https://newleftreview.org/issues/II102/articles/hazem-kandil-sisi-s-egypt.pdf|title=Sisi's Egypt|journal=New Left Review |date=November–December 2016|issue=102|pages=29–30}}</ref>}}

George Lawson from the [[London School of Economics]] places the Arab uprisings within the post-Cold War world. He characterises the uprisings as "largely unsuccessful revolution" and that they "bare a family resemblance to the 'negotiated revolutions'... Negotiated revolutions ... seek to transform political and symbolic fields of action, but without a concomitant commitment to a program of economic transformation."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/63156/1/Lawson_Revolution%2C%20non-violence.pdf|last=Lawson|first=George|title=''Revolution, non-violence, and the Arab Uprisings''|journal=Mobilization: An International Quarterly |year=2015|issn=1086-671X|page=24|access-date=6 April 2019}}</ref> In this 'negotiated revolution', comments Bayat, "revolutionaries had in effect little part in the 'negotiations'."{{sfn|Bayat|2017|p=161}} What has been treated by some analysts as intellectual weakness of the revolutionary movement is partly due to the pre-2011 stifling cultural environment under repressive regimes. Although Egyptian intellectualls enjoyed a bigger margin of freedom than their counterparts in Tunisia, cultural figures sought protection from political players, and instead of leading criticism, they complied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mafhoum.com/press/53C33.htm|last=Mehrez|first=Samia|title=Take Them Out of the Ball Game|publisher=Middle East Report 219|date=Summer 2001|access-date=6 April 2019}}</ref>

The post-Cold War era saw the emergence of the idea and practice of gradual reform and liberal agenda. It saw an influx of humanitarian projects, [[NGOs]] and charity work, liberal [[think tanks]] and emphasis on [[civil society]] work. This new juncture seemed to have made the idea and prospect of revolution an outdated project. The focus instead shifted to individual freedoms and [[free market]]. The new idea of [[civil society]] was different from the kind of civil society [[Antonio Gramsci]], for instance, envisaged: 'a revolution before the revolution'.

In her field study in Yemen, anthropologist Bogumila Hall depicts the effects of what she terms as "the marketization of civil society and its heavy reliance on donors", which "led to a largely depoliticized form of activism that by passed, rather than confronted, the state". Hall, with her focus on the ''muhammashīn'' (the marginalized) in Yemen, described how in the 1990s and 2000s international NGOs established charity projects and workshops "to teach slum dwellers new skills and behaviours". But, besides the "modest changes" brought by the NGOs, concludes Hall, "delegating the problem of the ''muhammashīn'' to the realm of development and poverty alleviation, without addressing the structural causes underlying their marginalisation, had a depoliticising effect. It led to a widely held assumption, also shared by the ''muhammashīn'', that ending marginalisation was a matter for experts and administrative measures, not politics."<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://journals.openedition.org/cy/3427?lang=en#text|access-date=8 April 2019|last=Hall|first=Bogumila|date=2017|title=This is our homeland": Yemen's marginalized and the quest for rights and recognition|journal=Arabian Humanities |issue=9|doi=10.4000/cy.3427|doi-access=free}}</ref>

When Arab regimes viewed NGOs' leaders and other similar organisations with suspicion, accusing Western governments of providing funding and training to 'illegal organisations' and fomenting revolution, diplomatic cables reported "how American officials frequently assured skeptical governments that the training was aimed at reform, not promoting revolutions".<ref>{{cite news|last=Nixon|first=Ron|title=U.S. Groups Helped Nurture Arab Uprisings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/world/15aid.html|access-date=10 April 2019|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 April 2011}}</ref> And when the Egyptian uprising was gaining its momentum, the American president Barack Obama "did not suggest that the 82-year-old leader step aside or transfer power... the argument was that he really needed to do the reforms, and do them fast.

Early 2019 witnessed two uprisings: one in Algeria and another in Sudan. In Algeria under pressure of weeks of protests, the head of the army forced the ailing twenty-year-serving president, [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], to abdicate. In Sudan, after four months of protests, the Sudani defense minister ousted longtime President [[Omar al-Bashir]] in a coup.<ref>{{cite news|title=Omar al-Bashir ousted: How Sudan got there|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47892742|access-date=13 April 2019|website=BBC |date=11 April 2019}}</ref> Writing about what he calls "a rebirth of Tahrir Square", the prominent Lebanese novelist and critic [[Elias Khoury]], averred that "perhaps the secret of the Arab Spring lies not in its victories or defeats, but in its ability to liberate people from fear." Despite the "faded spirit of Tahrir Square" and an outcome that Khoury describes as a "monarchy that abrogates legal standards", a renaissance of resistance is unstoppable:

{{quote|The defeat of the Arab Spring has seemed likely to extinguish this glimmer of hope, to return the Arab world to the tyrannical duopoly of military and oil and to crush the will of the people in the struggle between Sunni and Shia, between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The combination has thrown the region into Israelʹs lap. But the defeat cannot and will not stop the renaissance. If the Arab world has reached rock bottom, it canʹt go any lower and it canʹt last forever.<ref>{{cite web|last=Khoury|first=Elias|url=https://en.qantara.de/content/elias-khoury-on-the-arab-spring-2019-the-re-birth-of-tahrir-square?nopaging=1|title=The Rebirth of Tahrir Square|year=2019|publisher=Qantara.de |access-date=12 April 2019}}</ref>}}

There was a need, suggested Khoury, to turn "the uprisings of the Arab Spring into an intellectual, political and moral project that gives meaning to the goals of freedom, democracy and social justice". From the outset the 2011 Arab uprisings raised the banner of 'social justice'. The concept, what it means and how to achieve it has been a major subject of discussion and contention since then.

=== Social justice ===
In its economic and social manifesto, the Tunisian [[Ennahda Movement]] states that the movement "adopts the social and solidarised market economy within a national approach based on free economic activity, freedom of ownership, production and administration on the one hand, and social justice and equal opportunities on the other hand" and that "national capital has to be the axis in the development process."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ennahdha.tn/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%91%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9|title=اللائحة الاقتصادية الاجتمعاية|publisher= ennahda.tn|language=Arabic|access-date=17 April 2019}}</ref> The [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt]] mainly focuses on "reform of existing political systems in the Arab world. It embraces the idea of political activism and social responsibility, organising charitable works and social support programmes as part of its outreach to its core support base of lower-income populations."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/06/muslim-brotherhood-explained-170608091709865.html|title=What is the Muslim Brotherhood?|publisher=aljazeera.com|access-date=17 April 2019}}</ref>

On its part the [[International Centre for Transitional Justice]] has set nine 'concrete and tangible' goals with focus on "accountability for serious violations of human rights, access to justice, facilitating peace processes, advancing the cause of reconciliation and reforming the state and social institutions".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ictj.org/about|title=About us|publisher=International Centre for Transitional Justice|access-date=20 April 2019|date=15 February 2011}}</ref> One of those goals was taken up by [[Truth and Dignity Commission (Tunisia)]] that recorded and submitted to the relevant court the human rights abuses which had been committed by the Tunisian regime. A new climate of freedom of speech, freedom of organisation and elections characterised the political environment of post-Ben Ali Tunisia.

Some observers and social analysts remarked, however, that the issue of [[social justice]] remained a rhetoric or was marginalised. In the context of revolution. According to Fathi Al-Shamikhi, an expert in debt issues and founder of the Tunisian association [[RAID]], different social forces played a crucial role in matters related to social demands and achieving social justice. "This role varies between those who advocate these demands and those who reject them, according two the social nature of each of these forces."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialjusticeportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Social-Justice-Concept-and-Policies-after-the-Arab-Revolutions-E.pdf|title=Social Justice in the Light of the Revolutionary Process in Tunisia in ''Social Justice Concept and Policies After the Arab Revolutions''|publisher=Arab Forum for Alternative Studies, Rosa Luxemburg Foundation|date=2014|access-date=20 April 2019|page=93}}</ref>
"Bread, freedom and social justice" were the main slogans of the Arab revolutions. But although social and economic demands were raised, argued researcher and former editor in chief of the Egyptian [[Al-Shorouq]] Newspaper, Wael Gamal, "they were pushed aside in the political arena, and more attention was given to issues such as the transfer of power arrangements, the constitution first, the elections first, democratic transformation and the religious-secular conflict."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialjusticeportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Social-Justice-Concept-and-Policies-after-the-Arab-Revolutions-E.pdf|title=Social Justice and the Arab Revolutions: The Complexities of the Concept and Policies in ''Social Justice Concept and Policies After the Arab Revolutions''|publisher=Arab Forum for Alternative Studies, Rosa Luxemburg Foundation|date=2014|access-date=20 April 2019|page=15}}</ref>

=== Counter-revolution and civil wars ===
Reflecting on what happened first in Tunisia, Egypt and Bahrain and then in Libya, Yemen and Syria, Middle East correspondent and author [[Patrick Cockburn]] observed that, eight years later, the protesters in Sudan and Algeria had learned some lessons from the defeats. "Some of the powerful forces determined to stop revolutionary change in the Arab world," stated Cockburn, "are the same in 2019 as they were in 2011. The Arab Spring was a curious mix of revolution and [[counter-revolution]] to a degree seldom appreciated in the west."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/23/what-revolutionaries-in-the-middle-east-have-learned-since-the-arab-spring|last=Cockburn|first=Patrick|title=What Revolutionaries in the Middle East Have Learnt Since the Arab Spring|date=23 April 2019|magazine=CounterPunch|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>

But with the survival of the regime in Egypt and the rolling back of what was gained in the short period after the overthrow of [[Mubarak]], the persistence, or even the worsening, of the socio-economic conditions that led to the Tunisian uprising, a [[Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain]] assisted the defeat of the uprising in the country, and especially the descent of other uprisings into brutal 'civil' wars in Syria, Libya and Yemen, with acute humanitarian crises, there are
{{quote|many in capitals around the world who find it convenient to insist that a strongman is needed to deal with the peoples of this region. It is a racist, bigoted argument and should be called out as such, but many political leaders of the region are quite comfortable promoting it. Indeed, many of the counterrevolutionary moves in the region happened precisely because they agree with that argument.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/opinion/article-until-the-arab-world-enjoys-fundamental-rights-there-will-be-many|last=Hellyer|first=H.

Writing in April 2019, amidst an offensive to take Libya's capital [[Tripoli]] by [[Khalifa Haftar]] who gained the backing of the U.S. president Donald Trump, Marwan Kabalan argued that "counter-revolutionary forces are seeking to resurrect the military dictatorship model the Arab Spring dismantled." Kapalan contended that "regional and world powers have sponsored the return of military dictatorships to the region, with the hope that they would clean up the Arab Spring 'mess' and restore order." He also referred to Western powers' history of backing [[Military dictatorship|military rule]] in the region, and how American interests in the Middle East clashed with French but mainly with British ones, citing the American supported coups in Syria and Egypt, but generally how, as former US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] admitted, the United States "pursued stability at the expense of democracy... and achieved neither". Kabalan concluded:
{{quote|There seems to be a concerted effort to establish a crescent of military-ruled countries from Sudan in northeast Africa to Algeria in the northwest through Egypt and Libya to ward off popular upheaval and keep "Islamist" forces in check.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/indepth/opinion/middle-east-military-crescent-making-190429115639893.html|last=Kabalan|first=Marwan|title=In the Middle East, a new military crescent is in the making|date=29 April 2019|publisher=al-Jazeera.com|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>}}

Analyst [[H. A. Hellyer]] atrributes the persistence of [[autocracy]] and [[dictatorship]], as well as counter-revolution, to structures that go back to [[colonialism]]. But also to the forms the states in the [[MENA]] region took in the postcolonial era and the social pacts that were established in the process. What we are seeing today since 2011, argues Hellyer, is a clash between those "inherited structures" and the new "demographic realities" of the populations of the region.{{snf|Hellyer|2019|Globe and Mail}}

Compromise and dialogue with the entrenched regimes, followed by elections in [[Tunisia]] and Egypt have produced either limited change or counter-revolution. In the first quarter of 2019 protests and mass mobilisation in Sudan and Algeria succeeded in toppling the head of states, but it seems there is a dilemma, argues scholar and fellow at [[Woodrow Wilson Center]] [[Marina Ottaway]]. The demands of the genuine grassroots movements are unlikely, unfortunately, "to be attained through a peaceful process – one without violence and the violation of the human rights of many". Ottaway points out to the experiences of Algeria and Egypt when in the former the regime annulled the results of the elections in the early 1990s and in the latter when the military carried out a bloody repression of the Muslim Brotherhood government during the 2013 coup.
{{quote|Attempts to bring about radical changes, by punishing and excluding a large part of the old elite, are not possible by democratic means, because such efforts elicit a strong reaction – a counterrevolution – leading to violence and repression.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/algeria-and-sudan-revolutionary-dilemma|last=Ottaway|first=Marina|title=Algeria and Sudan: The revolutionary dilemma|date=1 May 2019|publisher= Middle East Eye|access-date=3 May 2019}}</ref>}}

== Space and the city in the Arab uprisings ==

For contemporary activists, protesting in Tahrir Square in the last decade always meant "a battle to control the space, especially under an authoritarian regime and heavy police state".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Atef Said|title=We ought to be here: Historizing space and mobilization in Tahrir Square|date=2015|publisher=SAGE Publication|journal=International Sociology|language=en|volume=30|issue=4|pages=348–366|doi=10.1177/0268580914551306|s2cid=145354846}}</ref> In an environment where people distrust formal politics, they find the streets almost the only space available to them to express their grievances, discontent and solidarity. As sociologist Bayat puts it, urban streets are not only a physical place for "street politics", but they also "signify a different but crucial symbolic utterance, one that transcends the physicality of street, to convey collective sentiments of a nation or a community".<ref>{{cite book|title=''Life as Politics: How Ordinary People Change the Middle East''|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeaspoliticsho00baya_487|url-access=limited|last=Bayat|first=Asef|date=2010|publisher=Stanford University Press, US|language=en|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeaspoliticsho00baya_487/page/n225 212]}}</ref> Researcher Atef Said makes a connection between previous events that took place in Tahrir and the 2011 occupation of the Square. "Spaces," writes Said, "carry meanings that are constructed over time, redeployed and reconfigured in the present, and carried forward as inspiration for the future."{{sfn|Said|2015|title=We ought to be here: Historizing space and mobilization in Tahrir Square}}

In a survey conducted by the National Center for Social and Criminological Research in Egypt, and its results published by the daily al-Masry al-Youm, just a week before the beginning of the uprising, the sample of 2,956 people expressed that achieving justice and political stability, lowering prices, having access to clean drinking water, and providing comfortable transportation topped the list of changes they desired for their country.<ref>{{cite news|author=Riham al-Iraqi|url=https://to.almasryalyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=285113|title=استطلاع رسمي يرصد أحلام المصريين|newspaper=al-Masry al-Youm|access-date=31 March 2019}}</ref>
