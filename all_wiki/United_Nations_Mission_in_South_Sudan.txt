<blockquote>
The members of the Security Council expressed their outrage at the recent attacks by armed groups in South Sudan that have purposefully targeted civilians as well as UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) sites and personnel, in particular 17 April attack against the UNMISS compound in Bor that resulted in scores of dead and injured, including those seeking the shelter and protection of the United Nations, and 14 April attacks in Bentiu and [[Unity State]].

The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms these acts and underscored that attacks on civilians and UN peacekeepers may constitute a war crime.

As part of its mandate to conduct human rights reporting, UNMISS released a report in mid-2015 on an alleged campaign of violence by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and associated armed groups in [[Unity State]].

UNMISS continued to struggle to cope with the large populations of internally displaced people living within the 'Protection of Civilians' (PoC) sites in 2015.

Ban Ki-moon requested an independent investigation of the deployment be made following reports that on 11 July South Sudanese troops rampaged through the capital, killing and raping civilians and foreign aid workers. The event had occurred following three days of fighting between troops loyal to President [[Salva Kiir]] and soldiers aligned with former Vice President [[Riek Machar]] that resulted in the deaths of 300 civilians and two UN peacekeepers. Led by [[Patrick Cammaert]], the investigation found that the force suffered from disorganization and a lack of leadership.

In 2017, the United Kingdom began [[Operation Trenton]], a deployment of over 300 personnel to support UNMISS. It concluded in 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=UK’s largest UN mission draws to a close after four successful years |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uks-largest-un-mission-draws-to-a-close-after-four-successful-years |website=GOV.UK |accessdate=19 March 2020}}</ref>

==Criticism and Alternative International Interventions==

As stated, the UNMISS is present in the country since its independence in 2011. However, as demonstrated throughout the mission's [[United Nations Mission in South Sudan#History|history]], there were numerous incidents that point towards an inability of the peacekeeping forces to protect civilians. In general, scholars such as Weinstein question the effectiveness of peacekeeping missions,<ref name="auto1">{{cite journal|last1=Weinstein|first1=Jeremy M.|title=Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective|date=2005|url=https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/2731_file_WP57.pdf}}</ref> and it is not difficult to find a peacekeeping "fiasco"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fearon and Laitin|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States|journal=International Security|date=2004|volume=28|issue=4 |pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}</ref> among the numerous peacekeeping missions undertaken within the history of the United Nations. While it is impossible to establish a counterfactual for the assessment and evaluation of peacekeeping missions and their effectiveness,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fortna|first1=Virginia Page|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War.|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}</ref> – i.e. we do not know how the situation in South Sudan would look like, if the UN would not have deployed peacekeeping forces, – an article published in the New York Times has called for an alternative international intervention for South Sudan.<ref name="Quandary in South Sudan">{{cite web|last1=Gettleman|first1=Jeffrey|title=Quandary in South Sudan: Should It Lose Its Hard-Won Independence?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/world/africa/quandary-in-south-sudan-should-it-lose-its-hard-won-independence.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> Thereby, the alternatives for international interventions are numerous. The article mentions trusteeship as a potential solution to the violent chaos in South Sudan.<ref name="Quandary in South Sudan"/> This form of international intervention was prominently discussed by Fearon and Laitin.<ref name="auto2">{{cite journal|last1=Fearon and Laitin|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States|journal=International Security|date=2004|volume=28|issue=4|pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}</ref>

The authors thereby suggest a system of neo-trusteeship, in which peacekeeping efforts should be oriented towards state building under the coordination of a leading (outside) state.<ref name="auto2"/> This state building should encompass the establishment of institutions that are necessary for increasing South Sudan's capability for collecting taxes, which could increase the governance capacity of the country.<ref name="auto2"/> To avoid that South Sudan breaks into war again, according to Fearon and Laitin's neo-trusteeship approach, a continuous international monitoring and support system might be required.<ref name="auto2"/> However, the New York Times article mentions that some South Sudanese would not tolerate such an international trusteeship and might see it as an intrusion into their hard-won independence.<ref name="Quandary in South Sudan"/>

Furthermore, as pointed out by Weinstein, neo-trusteeship is a post-conflict international intervention.<ref name="auto1"/> As South Sudan is still in the midst of a bloody conflict, Weinstein would suggest refraining from any kind of international intervention and leaving the South Sudanese to solve their conflict autonomously ("autonomous recovery"<ref name="auto1"/>), usually through the victory of one of the conflict parties over the other.<ref name="auto1"/>
