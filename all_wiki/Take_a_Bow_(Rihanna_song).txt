"'''Take a Bow'''" is a song recorded by [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] singer [[Rihanna]] for ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded]]'' (2008), the re-release of her third studio album ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]'' (2007). The song was written and produced by Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel Eriksen, and Shaffer Smith under their stage names [[Stargate (production team)|StarGate]] and [[Ne-Yo]]. "Take a Bow" was released as the first single on April 15, 2008 from the re-release and the fifth single overall from the two releases. It is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song that contains elements of [[dance-pop]]. Critical reception of "Take a Bow" was mixed, with some critics praising the song's lyrics and powerful balladry, while others criticized StarGate's production as unoriginal.

In the US, the song peaked at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and became Rihanna's third song to do so. "Take a Bow" also peaked at number one on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart and US [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] chart, and has been certified quadruple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The song reached number one in Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom, and attained top five positions in Australia, New Zealand, and Norway. Its accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Anthony Mandler]] and presents Rihanna as the female protagonist who leaves her boyfriend because of his infidelity. Rihanna performed "Take a Bow" on "[[AOL]] Music Sessions" and was included on the [[set list]]s of the [[Good Girl Gone Bad Tour]] (2008–09), [[Last Girl on Earth]] (2010–11), [[Loud Tour]] (2011) and [[Diamonds World Tour]] (2013).

==Critical reception==
"Take a Bow" received mixed reviews from music critics. Upon the song's release as an official single, Nick Levine of [[Digital Spy]] commented its choice for the promotion of ''Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded'', writing that the singer could have chosen "Breakin' Dishes" which served as a promotional single for ''Good Girl Gone Bad'' and charted at number four on the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart in February 2008<ref name="BreakinDishesDance">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2008-02-09/dance-club-play-songs|title=Week of February 9, 2008|work=Billboard|date=February 9, 2008|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}</ref>—but had opted for "Take a Bow" due to it being new and more likely to find a receptive audience.<ref name="Levine1">{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Nick|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a95327/rihanna-take-a-bow.html|title=Rihanna: 'Take A Bow'|date=May 19, 2008|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}</ref> Levine continued in his review to write that although the ballad succeeds in its mission of telling of a failed relationship, he noted that the song was not at the same level as the singer's previous single, "[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]" (2007). Levine cited that his reason for this was that "'Take a Bow' does what it sets out to do very well, but it's an underwhelming follow-up to the dancefloor rush of 'Don't Stop The Music{{'}}".<ref name="Levine1"/> Levine also commented on the song with regard to the other new songs included on the re-release, "[[Disturbia (song)|Disturbia]]" and "[[If I Never See Your Face Again]]" (a collaboration with [[Maroon 5]]), as part of his review of ''Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded'', writing that "Take a Bow" is inferior to the former, but superior to the latter.<ref name="Levine2">{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Nick|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/albumreviews/a98660/rihanna-good-girl-gone-bad-reloaded.html|title=Rihanna: 'Good Girl Gone Bad Reloaded'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]].

As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics "''Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not''", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets up and walks over to the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.

Erika Brooks Adickman of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] commented that Rihanna had once again changed her hair style and was wearing a red jacket which looked similar to the one [[Michael Jackson]]{{'}}s video "[[Beat It]]".<ref name="Adickman">{{cite web|last=Brooks Adickman|first=Erika|url=http://idolator.com/5775551/pop-upgraded-rihannas-music-video-style-evolution-photos/rihanna-take-a-bow-rihanna|title=Pop.
