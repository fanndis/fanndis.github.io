== Origins ==
The Save the Children Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by [[Eglantyne Jebb]] and her sister [[Dorothy Buxton]] as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] during the Allied [[blockade of Germany]] of [[World War I]] which continued after the [[Armistice]].<ref name="Yates 2011">{{cite web|url=https://www.leader-values.com/leader.php?lid=1|title=Eglantyne Jebb|last=Yates|first=Mick|work=LeaderValues|access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref>

At the end of [[World War I]], images of malnourished and sick children ran throughout Europe. The Fight the Famine Council was initially started earlier in 1919 to put political pressure on the British government to end the blockade, the first meeting having been held at the home of [[Catherine Courtney, Baroness Courtney of Penwith|Catherine Courtney]], at [[15 Cheyne Walk]]. However, on 15 April 1919, the sisters succeeded in separating itself from the politics of the council and creating a separate "Save the Children Fund".<ref name="Yates 2011"/>

In May 1919, the Fund was publicly established at a meeting in London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] to "provide relief to children suffering the effects of war" and raise money for emergency aid to children suffering from the wartime shortages of food and supplies.<ref>Nault, pg. 6 2003</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.royalalberthall.com/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Performance&id=Olomootoxidiot&pos=1|title=CalmView: Overview|website=catalogue.royalalberthall.com|access-date=27 June 2017}}</ref>

Jebb and her sister worked to gain public sympathy to elicit support aid.<ref>Hyder, pg. 2 2005</ref> In December 1919, [[Pope Benedict XV]] publicly announced his support for Save the Children, and declared 28 December '[[Innocents Day]]' to collect donations.<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/about_us/history.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315193829/http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/about_us/history.html |date=15 March 2005 }}. Save the Children.</ref>

The first branch was opened in Fife, Scotland in 1919. A counterpart, [[Rädda Barnen]] (which means "Save the Children"), was founded later that year in Sweden with [[Anna Kleman]] on the board.<ref name=Blekinge>[https://kulturlandskapetblekinge.wordpress.com/2015/04/16/anna-kleman-unik-i-systerduo/ " Anna Kleman – med engagemang i kvinnofrågor och fredsarbete"]. Läst 15 januari 2018.</ref> Along with a number of other organisations, they founded the [[International Save the Children Union]] in Geneva on 6 January 1920. Jebb built up excellent relationships with other Geneva-based organisations, including the [[Red Cross]] who supported Save's International foundation.<ref name="Yates 2011"/>

Jebb used many ground-breaking fund-raising techniques, making Save the Children the first charity in the United Kingdom to use page-length advertisements in newspapers. Jebb contracted doctors, lawyers and other professionals to devise mass advertisement campaigns. In 1920, Save the Children started individual child sponsorship as a way to engage more donors. By the end of the year, Save the Children raised the equivalent to about £8,000,000 in today's money.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

=== Russian famine ===
By August 1921, the UK Save the Children had raised over £1,000,000, and conditions for children in Central Europe were improving due to their efforts. However, the [[Russian famine of 1921]] made Jebb realise that Save the Children must be a permanent organisation and that children's rights constantly need to be protected.<ref>Nault, pg. 7 2003</ref> Their mission was thus changed to "an international effort to preserve child life wherever it is menaced by conditions of economic hardship and distress".<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

From 1921 to 1923, Save the Children created press campaigns, propaganda movies and feeding centres in Russia and in Turkey to feed and educate thousands of refugees. They began to work with several other organisations such as the Russian [[Famine]] Relief Fund and Nansen which resulted in recognition by the [[League of Nations]]. Although Russia was largely closed off to international relief and aid, Save the Children persuaded Soviet authorities to let them have a ground presence.<ref name="Yates 2011"/>

At home, the ''[[Daily Express]]'' criticised the Fund's work, denying the severity of the situation and arguing they should be helping their own people before helping Russia. The charity responded with increased publicity about the famine, showing images of starving children and mass graves. The campaign gained national appeal, eventually allowing the organisation to charter the SS ''Torcello'' to Russia with 600 tons' worth of relief supplies. Over 157 million rations were given out, saving nearly 300,000 children. Improved conditions meant Save the Children's Russian feeding program was able to be closed in the summer of 1923, after having won international acclaim.<ref name="Yates 2011"/><ref>Breen, Rodney (1994). "Saving Enemy Children: Save the Children's Russian Relief Organisation, 1921–1923". Disasters 18 (3), 221–237.</ref>

=== Second World War ===
Save the Children staff were among the first into the liberated areas after [[World War II]], working with refugee children and displaced persons in former occupied Europe, including survivors of [[Nazi concentration camps]]. At the same time, work in the United Kingdom focused on improving conditions for children growing up in cities devastated by bombing and facing huge disruptions in family life.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

=== Continuing crises ===
The 1950s saw a continuation of this type of crisis-driven work, with additional demands for help following the [[Korean War]] and the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], but also the opening of new work in Africa, Asia and the Middle East in response to the decline of the British empire.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Like other [[aid agency|aid agencies]], Save the Children was active in the major disasters of the era—especially the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Biafra]] secession in Nigeria. The latter brought shocking images of child starvation onto the television screens of the West for the first time in a major way. The sort of mass-marketing campaigns first used by Save the Children in the 1920s was repeated, with great success in fundraising.

Disasters in Ethiopia, Sudan, and many other world hotspots led to appeals which brought public donations on a huge scale, and a consequent expansion of the organisation's work. However, the children's [[rights-based approach to development]] originated by Jebb continues to be an important factor. It was used in a major campaign in the late 1990s against the use of [[child soldier]]s in Africa.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

During the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|2014 Ebola outbreak]] in Sierra Leone, new cases outnumbered the available hospital beds in the country. Save the Children worked with the UK government's Department for International Development and Ministry of Defence to build and run a 100-bed treatment centre in Sierra Leone, as well as support an Interim Care Center in [[Kailahun]] for children who had lost their families to Ebola.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Uenuma|first1=Francine|title=Desperate Demand for Ebola Treatment in Sierra Leone; Five People Infected Every Hour|url=http://www.savethechildren.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=8rKLIXMGIpI4E&b=8943305&ct=14223797&notoc=1|website=savethechildren.org|access-date=1 October 2014}}</ref>

== Declaration of the Rights of the Child ==
In 1923, Jebb wrote: "I believe we should claim certain rights for the children and labour for their universal recognition, so that everybody—not merely the small number of people who are in a position to contribute to relief funds, but everybody who in any way comes into contact with children, that is to say the vast majority of mankind—may be in a position to help forward the movement."<ref>Hyder, pg. 3 2005</ref>

Jebb created an initial draft for what would become the UN [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]] in 1923. It contained the following five criteria:

# The child must be given the means requisite for its normal development, both materially and spiritually.
# The child that is hungry must be fed, the child that is sick must be nursed, the child that is backward must be helped, the delinquent child must be reclaimed, and the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succored.
# The child must be the first to receive relief in times of distress.
# The child must not be put in a position to earn a livelihood and must be protected against every form of exploitation.
# The child must be brought up in the consciousness that its talents must be devoted to the service of its fellow men.<ref name="Yates 2011"/>

These five points were adopted by the [[League of Nations]] in 1924 and were thus known as the [[Declaration of Geneva]]. This was the first important assertion of the rights of children as separate from adults and began the process that would lead to the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], adopted by the United Nations in 1989.<ref name="Yates 2011"/>

=== Convention on the Rights of the Child ===
Following the atrocities of World War II, the United Nations adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. However, many felt the rights of children needed to be addressed in further detail with a separate document.

In November 1959, the UN General Assembly altered Jebb's initial criteria to produce the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]]. This consisted of ten non-binding principles for states to follow to work in the best interests of the child. However, this 1959 declaration was not legally binding and was only a statement of general principles and intent.<ref name="UNICEF 2008">UNICEF 2008</ref>
In 1989, however, it was adopted by the [[UN General Assembly]]. On 2 September 1990 it became international law.<ref name="UNICEF 2008"/>

The Convention consists of 54 articles that address the basic human rights that all children are entitled to: the right to survival; development to the fullest; protection from harmful influences, abuse and exploitation; and full participation in family, cultural and social life.<ref name="UNICEF 2008"/> The four core principles of the convention are non-discrimination; devotion to the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival, and development; and respect for the views of the child.

Today, the Convention serves as the basis for all of Save the Children's work. It has been ratified in every country around the world, with the exception of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/theres-only-one-country-hasnt-ratified-convention-childrens-rights-us|title=There's Only One Country That Hasn't Ratified the Convention on Children's Rights: US|access-date=16 August 2016}}</ref>

== Campaigns ==
=== Rewrite the Future ===
Rewrite the Future is Save the Children's first global campaign involving all 28 members of the Save the Children Alliance. Beginning in 2006, the campaign focuses on obtaining equal and quality education for children who are unable to attend school due to conflict or war. The campaign is focused in 28 states where armed conflict is particularly relevant including Afghanistan, Angola, Colombia, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Indonesia, Liberia, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, and Uganda.<ref>[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/what_we_do/rewritethefuture/index.html Rewrite the Future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520124934/http://savethechildren.net/alliance/what_we_do/rewritethefuture/index.html |date=20 May 2011 }}. Save the Children.</ref>
In 2008, Save the Children surpassed its goal of improving educational standards for eight million children by reaching over 10 million.

=== Every One Campaign ===
The Every One Campaign was started in October 2009 as a result of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] created in 2000. The fourth goal aims to reduce the child mortality rate by two-thirds by 2015. Save the Children is working to achieve this goal through their Every One Campaign and their seven step program stating:<ref>[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/what_we_do/every_one/index.html Every One] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520125000/http://savethechildren.net/alliance/what_we_do/every_one/index.html |date=20 May 2011 }}.

In developing countries, frontline health workers are often the only link to health care for children who live beyond the reach of hospitals and clinics. They can provide a range of proven, lifesaving services including maternal and newborn care, child health, and management of chronic and communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, AIDS and diabetes. Yet according to the World Health Organization, there is a global shortage of at least one million frontline health workers.<ref>http://frontlinehealthworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/FHWC_Issue_Brieffinal.pdf</ref>

== Structure and accountability ==
Save the Children is an international umbrella organisation, with 29 national member organisations serving over 120 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.savethechildren.net/where-we-work|title=Where we work|work=Save the Children International|access-date=11 June 2015}}</ref> Members lead on activities within their home territory and work with donors to develop programmes abroad, which are coordinated and delivered by a central body - [https://www.savethechildren.net/ Save the Children International] - via teams on the ground in each country. Save the Children International also oversees humanitarian responses.

All members of the association are bound by the International Save the Children Alliance Bylaws which includes The Child Protection Protocol and Code of Conduct. These set a standard for common values, principles, and beliefs.<ref name="ReferenceB">[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/about_us/structure/index.html Our Structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520124615/http://savethechildren.net/alliance/about_us/structure/index.html |date=20 May 2011 }}. Save the Children.</ref>

The Save the Children International website states that the member organisations work towards achieving four key initiatives:

# Secure quality education for 8 million children affected by armed conflict.
# Expand and improve their presence in countries of strategic importance.
# Create a stronger voice for children where more than one member has programmes by integrating country operations.
# Become the emergency response agency for children worldwide by improving disaster preparedness and response capacity so that they can best deliver immediate and lasting improvements to children.

=== Connections with other organisations ===
Save the Children helps to fund, and is aided with funds raised by, the British will-making scheme [[Will Aid]], in which participating solicitors waive their usual fee to write a basic will and in exchange invite the client to donate to charity.<ref name="Will Aid">[http://www.willaid.org.uk/charities Will Aid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420062003/http://www.willaid.org.uk/charities |date=20 April 2009 }}</ref> Save the Children collaborates with other NGOs in [[Family Tracing and Reunification]].<ref name=icrc2004>{{cite web|title=Inter-agency Guiding Principles on UNACCOMPANIED and SEPARATED CHILDREN|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc_002_1011.pdf|date=January 2004|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross}}</ref>

Pakistani investigators said in a July 2012 report that Dr. [[Shakil Afridi]] met 25 times with "foreign secret agents, received instructions and provided sensitive information to them."<ref name="wapo20120726">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistan-recounts-how-convicted-spy-helped-us-in-bin-laden-operation/2012/07/26/gJQAGyL1BX_story.html | title=Pakistan recounts in new report how doctor helped U.S. in bin Laden operation | work=The Washington Post | date=26 July 2012 | access-date=27 July 2012 | author=Leiby, Richard}}</ref> According to an early draft of a Pakistan Government report, which has not been publicly released, Afridi told investigators that the charity Save the Children helped facilitate his meeting with US intelligence agents although the charity denies the charge. The report alleges that Save the Children's Pakistan director at the time of the incident introduced Afridi to a western woman in [[Islamabad]] and that Afridi and the woman met regularly afterwards.<ref name="guardian20120905">{{cite news | url=http://gu.com/p/3a8ct | title=Pakistan orders Save the Children foreign workers to leave |newspaper=The Guardian | date=5 September 2012 | access-date=6 September 2012 | author=Boone, Jon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/pakistan-orders-expulsion-save-children-staff-105312846.html|title=Save the Children foreign staff told to leave Pakistan|access-date=27 June 2017}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19500103|title=Save the Children foreign staff ordered out of Pakistan|work=BBC News}}</ref>

The claim that the Save the Children Country Director had introduced Afridi to the woman is not credible, as the Country Director concerned had left Pakistan permanently well before the alleged meeting took place. The allegation does not appear in subsequent drafts of the report, although the document has still not been publicly released.

On 11 June 2015, Pakistani authorities ordered all Save the Children workers to leave Pakistan within 15 days, and the organisation's office in Islamabad was closed and padlocked.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Boone|first1=Jon|title=Pakistan shuts down Save the Children offices in Islamabad|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/12/pakistan-shuts-down-save-the-children-offices-in-islamabad|access-date=12 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 June 2015|location=Islamabad}}</ref>

On 5 March 2020, the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]] published an investigation report that found there had been serious weaknesses in the charity's workplace culture and "mismanagement in the administration of the charity". There were 5 complaints of sexual harassment and 13 of bullying between 2016 and June 2018. The charity trustees had not been sent copies of an external report on corporate culture.
