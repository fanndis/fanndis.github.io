==History==
===Early years===
[[German Americans|German]] immigrant [[Oscar F. Mayer]] (1859–1955), born in [[Neresheim|Kösingen]], [[Germany]], began working at a meat market in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], and later in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. In 1883, Mayer and his brother Gottfried leased the Kolling Meat Market on the near-northside of Chicago. The Mayer brothers sold [[bratwurst]], [[liverwurst]], and [[weißwurst]], which were popular in the predominantly German neighborhoods around their Chicago meat market.<ref>{{cite web | title=Oscar Mayer Company History | url=http://brands.kraftfoods.com/oscarmayer/pdf/OM_Company_History.pdf | accessdate=2009-04-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202192900/http://brands.kraftfoods.com/oscarmayer/pdf/om_company_history.pdf|archivedate=February 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oscarmayerbacon.co.uk/history.htm | title=The 124 YEAR History of "Oscar Mayer" Foods | publisher=Oscar Mayer Bacon UK | accessdate=July 10, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014184546/http://www.oscarmayerbacon.co.uk/history.htm | archive-date=October 14, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdghw0cKYEgC&q=oscar+mayer+founded+1883&pg=PA55|title=Cutting Into the Meatpacking Line|work=google.com|isbn=9780807846957|last1=Fink|first1=Deborah|year=1998}}</ref>

As the meat market's popularity grew, it expanded its storefront and participated in sponsoring local events including the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lukas |first=Paul |url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/05/01/343392/ |title=Bringing Home the Bacon A German made America's first national meat. And that's no baloney. |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher=Cable News Network. A Time Warner Company. |date=2003-05-01 |accessdate=2017-08-03 }}</ref> By 1900, the company had 43 employees and Chicago-wide delivery service. In 1904, Oscar Mayer began branding its meats to capitalize on their popularity, beginning an industry-wide trend. Early company specialties were "Old World" sausages and [[Westphalian ham]]s, soon followed by bacon and wieners. In 1906, Oscar Mayer & Co. was among the first to volunteer to join the newly created federal [[meat inspection]] program. In 1919, the company made its first major expansion, with the purchase of a processing plant in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. The plant quickly proved to be a profitable, efficient operation, and in 1957 Madison became the corporate headquarters.

===Kraft ownership===
For nearly a century, Oscar Mayer remained an independent company owned primarily by descendants of the Mayer brothers who started it. In 1981, Oscar Mayer stockholders elected to sell the company to [[General Foods]]. Four years later, [[Altria|Philip Morris]] acquired General Foods, and in 1989 merged General Foods with the newly acquired [[Kraft Foods]] transforming it into Kraft General foods. Shares of Kraft Foods were first offered to the public via an initial public offering in 2001. [[Altria Group]] (formerly Philip Morris) spun off remaining shares of Kraft Foods to Altria shareholders in 2007.

On November 4, 2015, owner Kraft Heinz announced it would move the Oscar Mayer headquarters and the company's U.S. meats business from Madison to Chicago. The company also announced plans to consolidate its production facilities during the two following years, resulting in the shutdown of seven North American manufacturing facilities: [[Fullerton, California]], [[San Leandro, California]], [[Federalsburg, Maryland]], [[St. Marys, Ontario]], [[Campbell, New York]], [[Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania]]; and Madison.

In August 2017,'' [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' reported that the company planned to spend $10 million to reinvent the hot dog for a more health-conscious consumer. According to company research, this new [[Strategic management|strategy]] could increase sales of their hot dogs by 6%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruley |first1=Bryan |last2=Giammona |first2=Craig |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-08-02/why-the-hatchet-men-of-3g-spent-10-million-on-a-better-oscar-mayer-weiner |title=Why the Hatchet Men of 3G Spent $10 Million on a Better Oscar Mayer Wiener |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=2017-08-02 |accessdate=2017-08-03 }}</ref>

Oscar Mayer had several [[advertisements]] on TV involving young children, including the Oscar Mayer Wiener ad in 1963. The [[Television advertisement|commercial]] shows a young girl leading a group of children, singing about what they would get if they "were an Oscar Mayer wiener". It was written by [[Richard D. Trentlage]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/us/richard-d-trentlage-oscar-mayer-wiener-song-author-dies.html Richard D. Trentlage, 87, Who Wrote 'The Oscar Mayer Wiener Song,' Dies] ''The New York Times'', September 29, 2016</ref>

A 1974 TV commercial featured 4-year-old Andy Lambros holding a fishing rod and sandwich while singing, "My bologna has a first name, it's 'O-S-C-A-R'...".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmPRHJd3uHI | title=Oscar Mayer Commercial – 1973 | accessdate=July 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tvacres.com/food_meats_oscarmeyer.htm | title=Oscar Mayer Bologny Kid | accessdate=January 25, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  It became one of the longest-running TV commercials in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wihist.org/1T30J0U | title=Oscar Mayer Wiener Song | publisher=Dictionary of Wisconsin History | accessdate=June 10, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

A very early commercial jingle, possibly limited to radio, went something like this: "Acquire / the desire / to buy Oscar Mayer. / Famous for quality since 1883. / Look for the famous yellow band. / All meat sausage, / flavor's grand. / Be a wise and happy buyer, / and buy Oscar Mayer."  The actual words of the jingle may be slightly different..

Oscar Mayer is known for its [[Wienermobile]], which has toured the United States for over 70 years. The first Wienermobile was created in 1936.<ref>{{cite web|last= Koran| first= Mario| url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/28/oscar-mayer-wienermobile-police-stop-wisconsin| title= World's wurst driver: Oscar Mayer Wienermobile gets frank warning from officer| date= 29 January 2020| website= [[The Guardian]]| accessdate= 29 January 2020}}</ref>
