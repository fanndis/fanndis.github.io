Philip was born into the [[Greek royal family|Greek]] and [[Danish royal family|Danish royal families]]. He was born in Greece, but his family was exiled from the country when he was an infant. After being educated in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, he joined the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1939, aged 18. From July 1939, he began corresponding with the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth, whom he had first met in 1934. During the [[Second World War]] he served with distinction in the [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean]] and [[British Pacific Fleet|Pacific]] Fleets. After the war, Philip was granted permission by [[George VI]] to marry Elizabeth. Before the official announcement of their engagement in July 1947, he abandoned his Greek and Danish titles and styles, became a naturalised [[British subject]], and adopted his maternal grandparents' surname [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]]. He [[Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten|married Elizabeth]] on 20 November 1947. Just before the wedding, he was granted the style ''His Royal Highness'' and created [[Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Earl of Merioneth]] and [[Baron Greenwich]] by King George VI. Philip left active military service when Elizabeth became queen in 1952, having reached the rank of [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]], and was formally made a [[British prince]] in 1957.

Philip and Elizabeth have four children: [[Prince Charles]], [[Princess Anne]], [[Prince Andrew]], and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]]. Through a British [[Order in Council]] issued in 1960, descendants of the couple not bearing royal styles and titles can use the surname [[Mountbatten-Windsor]], which has also been used by some members of the royal family who do hold titles, such as Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward.

A keen sports enthusiast, Philip helped develop the equestrian event of [[carriage driving]]. He is a patron, president, or member of over 780 organisations, and he serves as chairman of [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award]], a self improvement program for young people aged 14 to 24.<ref>{{cite web |title=Do your DofE – The Duke of Edinburgh's Award |url=https://www.dofe.org/do-your-dofe/ |website=dofe.org |accessdate=29 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129181534/https://www.dofe.org/do-your-dofe/ |archive-date=29 January 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is the longest-serving consort of a reigning British monarch and the oldest ever male member of the [[British royal family]]. Philip retired from his royal duties on 2 August 2017, aged 96, having completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952.

==Early life==
[[File:Corfu Mon Repos R01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mon Repos, Corfu|Mon Repos]], Philip's birthplace]]
Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in [[Mon Repos, Corfu|Mon Repos]] on the Greek island of [[Corfu]] on 10 June 1921, the only son and fifth and final child of [[Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark]] and [[Princess Alice of Battenberg]].<ref>Brandreth, p. 56</ref> A member of the [[House of Glücksburg]], the [[Monarchy of Denmark|ruling house of Denmark]], he was a prince of both Greece and Denmark by virtue of his patrilineal descent from [[George I of Greece]] and [[Christian IX of Denmark]], and he was from birth in the line of succession to both thrones.{{#tag:ref|The Danish [[Act of Succession (Denmark)|Act of Succession 1953]] removed the succession rights of his branch of the family in Denmark.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tågholt |first=Knud |year=1963 |title=Det glücksburgske kongehus, fra Christian IX til prinsesse Margrethe: Den danske kongeslægt gennem hundrede år, 1863–1963 |publisher=Aros |page=6}}</ref>|group=fn}} Philip's four elder sisters were [[Princess Margarita of Greece and Denmark|Margarita]], [[Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark (1906–1969)|Theodora]], [[Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark|Cecilie]], and [[Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark|Sophie]]. He was baptised in the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] rite at [[Old Fortress, Corfu|St. George's Church in the Old Fortress]] in Corfu.

Shortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]], then known as Louis Mountbatten, [[Marquess of Milford Haven]], died in London. Louis was a naturalised [[British subject]] who, after a career in the [[Royal Navy]], had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]]—an Anglicised version of [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]]—during the [[World War I|First World War]], owing to [[Anti-German sentiment#First World War|anti-German sentiment]] in Britain. After visiting London for his grandfather's memorial service, Philip and his mother returned to Greece, where Prince Andrew had remained to command a Greek Army division embroiled in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]].<ref>Brandreth, pp. 58–59</ref>

The war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains. Philip's uncle and high commander of the Greek expeditionary force, [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]], was blamed for the defeat and was [[11 September 1922 Revolution|forced to abdicate]] on 27 September 1922. The new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others. The commanding officer of the army, General [[Georgios Hatzianestis]], and five senior politicians, were arrested, tried, and executed in the [[Trial of the Six]]. Prince Andrew's life was also believed to be in danger, and Princess Alice was under surveillance. Finally in December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece, for life.<ref>{{cite journal|title=News in Brief: Prince Andrew's Departure|journal=The Times|date=5 December 1922|page=12}}</ref> The British naval vessel [[HMS Calypso (D61)|HMS ''Calypso'']] evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box. Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of [[Saint-Cloud]] in a house lent to them by his wealthy aunt, [[Princess George of Greece and Denmark]].<ref>Alexandra, pp. 35–37; Heald, p. 31; Vickers, pp. 176–178</ref>

Because Philip left Greece as a baby, he does not speak Greek. In 1992, he said that he "could understand a certain amount".<ref name="independent">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/a-strange-life-profile-of-prince-philip-1563268.html |work=The Independent |location=London |title=A strange life: Profile of Prince Philip |first=Fiammetta |last=Rocco |date=13 December 1992 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> Philip has stated that he thought of himself as Danish, and his family spoke English, French, and German.<ref name=independent /> Philip, who in his youth was known for his charm, was linked to a number of women, including [[Osla Benning]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/romances-young-prince-philip/ |title=The romances of young Prince Philip |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |first=Philip |last=Eade |date=5 May 2017 |access-date=10 August 2018}}</ref>

Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35664|date=11 August 1942 |page=3510 |supp=|nolink=y}}</ref> In October of the same year, he became first lieutenant of HMS ''Wallace'', at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy.

==Marriage==
{{further|Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten}}
[[File:Royal Monogram of Prince Philip of Great Britain.svg|thumb|upright|Philip's monogram]]
In 1939, [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] toured the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]]. During the visit, the Queen and [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] asked Philip to escort the King's two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]], who were Philip's [[Royal descendants of Queen Victoria and King Christian IX#Monarchs descended from Queen Victoria|third cousins]] through [[Queen Victoria]], and [[Royal descendants of Queen Victoria and King Christian IX#Monarchs descended from King Christian IX|second cousins once removed]] through [[King Christian IX of Denmark]].<ref>[[Alexandra of Yugoslavia|Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia]] quoted in Heald, p. 57</ref> Elizabeth fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters when she was 13.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 132–136, 166–168</ref>

Eventually, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage. The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's 21st birthday the following April.<ref>Brandreth, p. 183</ref> By March 1947, Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, had adopted the surname [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]] from his mother's family, and had become a naturalised British subject. The engagement was announced to the public on 10 July 1947.<ref>Heald, p. 77</ref>

Though Philip appeared "always to have regarded himself as an Anglican",<ref>''The Times'', 10 July 1947, p. 4</ref> and he had attended Anglican services with his classmates and relations in England and throughout his Royal Navy days, he had been baptised in the Greek Orthodox Church. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Geoffrey Fisher]], wanted to "regularise" Philip's position by officially receiving him into the Church of England,<ref>{{cite book |author=Boothroyd, Basil |author-link=Basil Boothroyd |year=1971 |title=Prince Philip: An Informal Biography |publisher=McCall |isbn=0841501165 |pages=45–47}}</ref> which he did in October 1947.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1947/10/04/archives/elizabeths-fiance-now-an-anglican.html "Elizabeth's Fiance Now an Anglican"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 4 October 1947</ref>

The day before the wedding, King George VI bestowed the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] of ''[[Royal Highness]]'' on Philip and, on the morning of the wedding, 20 November 1947, he was made the [[Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Earl of Merioneth]], and [[Baron Greenwich]] of Greenwich in the County of London.<ref name="LG 21 Nov 1947">{{London Gazette |issue=38128 |pages=5495–5496 |date=21 November 1947}}</ref> Consequently, being already a [[Knight of the Garter]], between 19 and 20 November 1947 he bore the unusual style His Royal Highness Sir Philip Mountbatten, and is so described in the [[Letters Patent]] of 20 November 1947.<ref name="LG 21 Nov 1947"/>

Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at [[Westminster Abbey]], recorded and broadcast by [[BBC]] radio to 200&nbsp;million people around the world.<ref>Heald, p. 86</ref> In post-war Britain it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters, all of whom had married German princes. After their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at [[Clarence House]]. Their first two children were born before Elizabeth succeeded her father as monarch in 1952:  [[Prince Charles]] in 1948 and [[Princess Anne]] in 1950. Their marriage is now the longest of any British monarch.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7101094.stm |title=Queen celebrates diamond wedding |date=19 November 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2017 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/9689130/Queen-and-Duke-of-Edinburgh-celebrate-65th-wedding-anniversary.html |title=Queen and Duke of Edinburgh celebrate 65th wedding anniversary |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 November 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2017 |first=Gordon |last=Rayner}}</ref>

With the King in ill health, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of [[Canada]]. At the end of January 1952, Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. On 6 February 1952, they were in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] when Elizabeth's father died and she became queen. It was Philip who broke the news to Elizabeth at [[Sagana Lodge]], and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 245–247</ref>

==Consort of the Queen==
===Royal house===

[[File:Elizabeth and Philip 1953.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Coronation of Elizabeth II|Coronation]] portrait of Elizabeth II with the Duke of Edinburgh, June 1953]]
The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the [[royal house]], as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name upon marriage. The Duke's uncle, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name ''House of Mountbatten''.

On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill as prime minister, the Queen issued an [[Order in Council]] declaring that [[Mountbatten-Windsor]] would be the surname of her and her husband's male-line descendants who are not styled as Royal Highness or titled as prince or princess.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/41948/supplement/1003 |work=[[The London Gazette]] |title=Supplement to The London Gazette of Friday, 5th February 1960 |date=8 February 1960}}</ref> While it seems the Queen had "absolutely set her heart" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only 11 days before the birth of [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] (19 February), and only after three months of protracted correspondence between constitutional expert [[Edward Iwi]] (who averred that, without such a change, the royal child would be born with "the Badge of Bastardy") and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] who had attempted to rebuff Iwi.<ref>Travis, Alan (18 February 1999).

After her accession to the throne, the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have "place, pre-eminence and precedence" next to her "on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by [[Act of Parliament]]". This meant the Duke took precedence over his son, the [[Prince of Wales]], except, officially, in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]]. In fact, however, he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual [[State Opening of Parliament]], where he walks and sits beside her.<ref>British-Japanese Parliamentary Group.

As consort to the Queen, Philip supported his wife in her new duties as sovereign, accompanying her to ceremonies such as the [[State Opening of Parliament]] in various countries, state dinners, and tours abroad. As chairman of the [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation]] Commission, he was the first member of the royal family to fly in a helicopter, visiting the troops that were to take part in the ceremony.<ref>Brandreth, p. 259</ref> Philip was not crowned in the service, but knelt before Elizabeth, with her hands enclosing his, and swore to be her "liege man of life and limb".<ref>Brandreth, p. 263</ref>
[[File:Prince Philip and Elizabeth II, 1954.jpg|left|thumb|In Queensland, Australia, 1954]]
In the early 1950s, his sister-in-law, [[Princess Margaret]], considered marrying a divorced older man, [[Peter Townsend (RAF officer)|Peter Townsend]]. The press accused Philip of being hostile to the match, to which he replied "I haven't done anything." Philip had not interfered, preferring to stay out of other people's love lives.<ref>Brandreth, p. 270</ref> Eventually, Margaret and Townsend parted. For six months, over 1953–54, Philip and Elizabeth toured the Commonwealth; as with previous tours the children were left in Britain.<ref>Brandreth, p. 278</ref>

In 1956, the Duke, with [[Kurt Hahn]], founded [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award]] in order to give young people "a sense of responsibility to themselves and their communities". In the same year, he also established the [[Commonwealth Study Conference]]s. From 1956 to 1957, Philip travelled around the world aboard the newly commissioned [[HMY Britannia|HMY ''Britannia'']], during which he opened the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in Melbourne and visited the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]], becoming the first royal to cross the [[Antarctic Circle]].<ref name="royanikkhah">{{cite web|last1=Nikkhah|first1=Roya|title=Prince Philip: The Duke you don't know|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8273569/Prince-Philip-the-Duke-you-dont-know.html|website=The Telegraph (UK)|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> The Queen and the children remained in the UK. On the return leg of the journey, Philip's private secretary, [[Michael Parker (courtier)|Mike Parker]], was sued for divorce by his wife. As with Townsend, the press still portrayed divorce as a scandal and eventually Parker resigned. He later said that the Duke was very supportive and "the Queen was wonderful throughout. She regarded divorce as a sadness, not a hanging offence."<ref>Quoted in Brandreth, p. 287</ref> In a public show of support, the Queen created Parker a Commander of the [[Royal Victorian Order]].<ref>Brandreth, pp. 287, 289</ref>

Further press reports claimed that the Queen and the Duke were drifting apart, which enraged the Duke and dismayed the Queen, who issued a strongly worded denial.<ref>Brandreth, p. 288</ref> On 22 February 1957, she granted her husband the style and title of a Prince of the United Kingdom by [[Letters Patent]], and it was gazetted that he was to be known as "His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh".<ref name="prince">{{London Gazette |issue=41009 |date=22 February 1957 |page=1209}}</ref> Philip was appointed to the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] on 14 October 1957, taking his [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]] before the Queen in person at her Canadian residence, [[Rideau Hall]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bousfield |first=Arthur |author2=Toffoli, Gary |title=Fifty Years the Queen |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=2002 |location=Toronto |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w8l5reK7NjoC&printsec=frontcover&q= |isbn=1-55002-360-8}}</ref> Remarks he made two years later to the [[Canadian Medical Association]] on the subject of youth and sport were taken as a suggestion that Canadian children were out of shape.

{{Quote|It is a complete misconception to imagine that the monarchy exists in the interests of the monarch. It doesn't. It exists in the interests of the people. If at any time any nation decides that the system is unacceptable, then it is up to them to change it.<ref>Brandreth, p. 50</ref>}}

Philip is [[Patronage|patron]] of some 800 organisations, particularly focused on the environment, industry, sport, and education.

====Charles and Diana====
[[File:Duke of Edinburgh 33 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip in 1992]]

At the beginning of 1981, Philip wrote to his eldest son, Charles, counselling him to make up his mind to either propose to [[Lady Diana Spencer]] or break off their courtship.<ref>Brandreth, p. 344; Lacey, p. 276</ref> Charles felt pressured by his father to make a decision and did so, proposing to Diana in February.<ref>Brandreth, p. 346; Lacey, pp. 277–278</ref> [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer|They married]] five months later. By 1992, the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales had broken down. The Queen and Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana, trying to effect a reconciliation, but without success.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 348–349</ref> Philip wrote to Diana, expressing his disappointment at both Charles's and her extra-marital affairs, and asking her to examine both his and her behaviour from the other's point of view.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 349–351</ref> She found the letters hard to take, but nevertheless appreciated that he was acting with good intent.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 351–353</ref> Charles and Diana separated and later divorced.

A year after the divorce, [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana was killed in a car crash]] in Paris on 31 August 1997. At the time, the Duke was on holiday at Balmoral with the extended royal family. In their grief, Diana's two sons, Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry|Harry]], wanted to attend church and so their grandparents took them that morning.<ref name=brandreth1>Brandreth, p. 358</ref> For five days, the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the ensuing press interest by keeping them at Balmoral, where they could grieve in private.<ref name="brandreth1" /> The royal family's seclusion caused public dismay,<ref name="brandreth1" /> but the public mood changed after a live broadcast made by the Queen on 5&nbsp;September.<ref name="brandreth2">Brandreth, p. 359</ref> Uncertain as to whether they should walk behind her coffin during the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|funeral procession]], Diana's sons hesitated.<ref name="brandreth2" /> Philip told William, "If you don't walk, I think you'll regret it later. If I walk, will you walk with me?"<ref name="brandreth2" /> On the day of the funeral, Philip, William, Harry, Charles, and Diana's brother, [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]], walked through London behind her bier.

Over the next few years, [[Mohamed Fayed]], whose son [[Dodi Fayed]] was also killed in the crash, claimed that Prince Philip had ordered the death of Diana and that the accident was staged. The inquest into the Princess of Wales's death concluded in 2008 that there was no evidence of a conspiracy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7322204.stm |work=BBC News |title=Duke 'did not order Diana death' |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>

On 3 April 2018, Philip was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital for a planned [[hip replacement]], which took place the next day.

Philip and the Queen regularly attended [[Cowes Week]] in [[HMY Britannia|HMY ''Britannia'']]. His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours.<ref>Heald, pp. 148–149</ref> He was presented with [[Royal Air Force]] wings in 1953.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monarchy |first=British |url=https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/ArmedForces/TheRoyalAirForce.aspx |title=The Royal Air Force |website=Official website of the British Monarchy |accessdate=6 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617152205/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/ArmedForces/TheRoyalAirForce.aspx |archive-date=17 June 2013 }}</ref> In April 2014, it was reported that an old [[British Pathe]] newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of [[South America]].

[[File:Her Majesty the Queen at Breakfast.jpg|thumb|''Her Majesty the Queen at Breakfast'' painted by her husband in 1957. Biographer [[Robert Lacey]] described the painting as "a tender portrayal, impressionistic in style, with brushstrokes that are charmingly soft and fuzzy".<ref>Lacey, p. 368</ref>]]

He has painted with oils, and collected artworks, including contemporary [[cartoon]]s, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle. [[Hugh Casson]] described Philip's own artwork as "exactly what you'd expect&nbsp;... totally direct, no hanging about. Strong colours, vigorous brushstrokes."<ref>Heald, p. 253</ref>

Philip's down-to-earth manner was attested to by a White House butler who recalled that, on a visit in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation and poured them drinks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/18/obama-inauguration|location=London |newspaper=The Guardian| first=Christopher|last=Goodwin|title=I'm tickled to death.

The historian [[David Starkey]] described him as a kind of "HRH [[Victor Meldrew]]".<ref>Starkey, speaking on BBC News Radio Four, 10 June 2011</ref> For example, in May 1999, British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, "No wonder you are deaf listening to this row."<ref>Brandreth, p. 46</ref> Later Philip wrote, "The story is largely invention. It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing."<ref>Letter of 4 June 1999 quoted in Brandreth, p. 46</ref> When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing." Menary later said: "I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke.

During a state visit to China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from [[Xi'an]]'s [[Northwest University (China)|North West University]], Philip joked, "If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed<!--Prince Philip insists he said "slit-eyed" and not "slitty-eyed": see Heald, p. 245-->."<ref>Heald, pp. 244–245; Lacey, p. 303</ref> The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go "round-eyed".<ref>Lacey, p. 304; see also Heald, p. 245 for a Hong Kong version of the "round-eyed" joke.</ref> His comment had no effect on [[China–United Kingdom relations|Sino-British relations]], but it shaped his own reputation.<ref>Heald, p. 246; Lacey, p. 304</ref>

[[File:Prince Philip as Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Canadian Regiment.jpg|thumb|The Duke of Edinburgh, [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]], presenting the 3rd Battalion with their Regimental Colours in April 2013]]
Philip has held a number of titles throughout his life. Originally holding the title and style of a [[prince of Greece and Denmark]], Philip abandoned these royal titles prior to his marriage, and was thereafter created a British [[duke]], among other noble titles. The Queen formally issued letters patent in 1957 making Philip a [[British prince]].<ref name=prince />

When addressing the Duke of Edinburgh, as with any male member of the royal family except the monarch, the rules of etiquette are to address him the first time as ''Your Royal Highness'', and thereafter as ''Sir''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/etiquette/british-behaviour/r-to-s/royalty.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112125544/http://www.debretts.com/etiquette/british-behaviour/r-to-s/royalty.aspx|archive-date=12 November 2010|title=Royalty – Debrett's Guide to British Behaviour|date=12 November 2010|accessdate=23 May 2018}}</ref>

===Honours and honorary military appointments===
The Duke of Edinburgh was appointed by King George VI to the [[Order of the Garter]] on 19 November 1947, the eve of his wedding. Since then, Philip has received 17 different appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth, and 48 from foreign states. The inhabitants of some villages on the island of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna, Vanuatu]] [[Prince Philip Movement|worship Prince Philip as a god]]; the islanders possess portraits of the Duke and hold feasts on his birthday.<ref>{{cite web|last=Squires|first=Nick|title=Is Prince Philip an island god?|publisher=BBC News|date=10 June 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6734469.stm|accessdate=12 October 2008|location=London, UK}}</ref>

==Ancestry==
Both Philip and Queen Elizabeth II are great-great-grandchildren of [[Queen Victoria]], Elizabeth by descent from Victoria's eldest son, [[King Edward VII]], and Philip by descent from Victoria's second daughter, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]]. Both are also descended from [[King Christian IX of Denmark]].

Philip is also related to the [[House of Romanov]] through both of his parents. He is a direct descendant of Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia]] via his paternal grandmother Grand Duchess [[Olga Constantinovna of Russia]].<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Hugh Massingberd|last=Montgomery-Massingberd|first=Hugh (ed.)|year=1977|title=Burke's Royal Families of the World'', 1st edition''|location=London|publisher=Burke's Peerage|isbn=0-85011-023-8|pages=469–474}}</ref> and his maternal grandmother, [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]], was a sister of [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)]], wife of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II]].

In 1993, scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of the Romanov family, more than 70 years after their [[execution of the Romanov family|massacre in 1918]], by comparing their [[mitochondrial DNA]] to living [[matrilineal]] relatives, including Philip. Philip, Alexandra, and her children are all descended from [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], the daughter of [[Queen Victoria]], through a purely female line.<ref name=gill>{{cite journal |last1=Gill |first1=Peter |last2=Ivanov |first2=Pavel L. |last3=Kimpton |first3=Colin |last4=Piercy |first4=Romelle |last5=Benson |first5=Nicola |last6=Tully |first6=Gillian |last7=Evett |first7=Ian |last8=Hagelberg |first8=Erika|author-link8=Erika Hagelberg |last9=Sullivan |first9=Kevin |date=February 1994 |title=Identification of the remains of the Romanov family by DNA analysis |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=130–135 |doi=10.1038/ng0294-130 |pmid=8162066 }}</ref>
