The [[trait theory|traits]] of '''extraversion''' (or '''extroversion''') and '''introversion''' are a central dimension in some human [[personality psychology|personality]] theories. The terms ''introversion'' and ''extraversion'' were popularized by [[Carl Jung]],<ref name="Psychologist he">Jung, C. G. (1921) ''Psychologische Typen'', Rascher Verlag, Zurich&nbsp;– translation H.G. Baynes, 1923.</ref> although both the popular understanding and psychological usage differ from his original intent. Extraversion tends to be manifested in outgoing, talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in more reserved and solitary behavior.<ref name="Thompson">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2008.06.013 |title=Development and Validation of an International English Big-Five Mini-Markers |year=2008 |last1=Thompson |first1=Edmund R. |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=542–8}}</ref> Rather than focusing on interpersonal behavior, however, Jung defined introversion as an "attitude-type characterised by orientation in life through subjective psychic contents", and extraversion as "an attitude-type characterised by concentration of interest on the external object".<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections|last1=Jung|first1=Carl|publisher=Fontana Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-00-654027-4|location=London|pages=414–5}}</ref>

Extraversion and introversion are typically viewed as a single [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], so to be high in one necessitates being low in the other. Jung provides a different perspective and suggests that everyone has both an extraverted side and an introverted side, with one being more dominant than the other. Virtually all comprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms. Examples include the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model]], Jung's [[analytical psychology]], [[Hans Eysenck]]'s [[Hans Eysenck#Model of personality|three-factor model]], [[Raymond Cattell]]'s [[16 personality factors]], the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]], and the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]].

==Varieties==
William McDougall discussed Jung's conception, and reached this conclusion: "the introverts are those in whom reflective thought inhibits and postpones action and expression: the extroverts are those in whom the energies liberated upon the stirring of any propensity flow out freely in outward action and expression."<ref>McDougall, W. (1923/1932). ''The Energies of Men: a Study of the Fundamentals of Dynamic Psychology'', Methuen & Co. Ltd, London, p. 184.</ref>
===Extraversion===
Extraversion (also spelled as ''extroversion''<ref name="sp">{{cite web|title=Is it extraversion or extroversion?|url=https://www.predictiveindex.com/blog/is-it-extraversion-or-extroversion|website=The Predictive Index|date=2016-08-02}} Retrieved 2018-02-21.</ref>) is the state of primarily obtaining [[gratification]] from outside oneself.<ref name="mw">Merriam Webster Dictionary.</ref> Extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be [[enthusiastic]], [[talkative]], [[assertive]], and [[gregarious]]. Extraverts are energized and thrive off being around other people. They take pleasure in activities that involve large [[social]] gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and business or political groups. They also tend to work well in groups.<ref name="Extraversion or Introversion">{{cite web|title=Extraversion or Introversion|url=http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/extraversion-or-introversion.htm|website=The Myers & Briggs Foundation|access-date=April 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405122457/http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/extraversion-or-introversion.htm|archive-date=April 5, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves.

===Introversion===
Introversion is the state of being predominantly interested in one's own mental self.<ref name= "mw"/> Introverts are typically perceived as more [[wikt:reserved|reserved]] or [[wikt:reflective|reflective]].<ref name="Extraversion or Introversion"/> Some popular psychologists have characterized introverts as people whose [[Energy (psychological)|energy]] tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction.<ref>[[Laurie Helgoe|Helgoe, Laurie]] (2008). "Introvert Power: Why Your Inner Life is Your Hidden Strength". Naperville, Illinois: Sourcebooks, Inc.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> This is similar to Jung's view, although he focused on mental energy rather than physical energy. Few modern conceptions make this distinction. Introverts often take pleasure in [[wikt:solitary|solitary]] activities such as reading, writing, or meditating. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement, introversion having even been defined by some in terms of a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating external environment.<ref name="CainQuiet">Cain, Susan, ''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking]]'', Crown Publishing 2012: quoted by Szalavitz, Maia, [http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/27/mind-reading-qa-with-susan-cain-on-the-power-of-introverts/ "'Mind Reading': Q&A with Susan Cain on the Power of Introverts"] ([https://www.webcitation.org/66HhhW8xS?url=http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/27/mind-reading-qa-with-susan-cain-on-the-power-of-introverts/ WebCite archive]), ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' Healthland, January 27, 2012; and [[Gareth Cook|Cook, Gareth]], [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-power-of-introverts&print=true "The Power of Introverts: A Manifesto for Quiet Brilliance"] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120219210617/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-power-of-introverts WebCite archive]), ''[[Scientific American]],'' January 24, 2012.</ref> They prefer to concentrate on a single activity at a time and like to observe situations before they participate, especially observed in developing children and adolescents.<ref name=intro>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g2602/is_0003/ai_2602000328 Introversion] ''Gale Encyclopedia of Childhood & Adolescence''.

[[File:ExtrovertIntrovertSpectrum.png|thumb|''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking|Quiet: The Power of Introverts...]]'' author [[Susan Cain]] defines introversion and extraversion in terms of preferences for different levels of stimulation—distinguishing it from shyness (fear of social judgment and humiliation).<ref name=TimeHealthland20120127>Szalavitz, Maia, [http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/27/mind-reading-qa-with-susan-cain-on-the-power-of-introverts/ "‘Mind Reading’: Q&A with Susan Cain on the Power of Introverts"] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/66HhhW8xS?url=http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/27/mind-reading-qa-with-susan-cain-on-the-power-of-introverts/ |date=2012-03-19 }}) ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' Healthland, January 27, 2012.</ref>]]
Mistaking introversion for [[shyness]] is a common error. Introversion is a preference, while shyness stems from distress. Introverts prefer solitary to social activities, but do not necessarily fear social encounters like shy people do.<ref>[http://psychcentral.com/library/shyness.htm All About Shyness] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912041228/http://psychcentral.com/library/shyness.htm |date=September 12, 2016 }} Meredith Whitten, Psych Central, August 21, 2001; Accessed 2007-08-02</ref> [[Susan Cain]], author of the book ''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking]]'', argues that modern [[Western culture]] misjudges the capabilities of introverted people, leading to a waste of talent, energy, and happiness.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking|author=Susan Cain|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/quiet-the-power-of-introverts-in-a-world-that-cant-stop-talking-by-susan-cain/|website = www.cbsnews.com|access-date = 2015-10-05}}</ref> Cain describes how society is biased against introverts, and that, with people being taught from childhood that to be sociable is to be happy, introversion is now considered "somewhere between a disappointment and pathology".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Book Review: Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/Book-Review-Quiet-The-Power-of-Introverts-in-a-3861336.php|access-date = 2015-10-05|date = 2012-09-12}}</ref> In contrast, Cain says that introversion is not a "second-class" trait but that both introverts and extraverts enrich society, with examples including the introverts [[J.

===Ambiversion===
Although many people view being introverted or extraverted as [[Mutually Exclusive|mutually exclusive]], most contemporary [[Trait theory|trait theories]] measure levels of extraversion-introversion as part of a single, continuous dimension of personality, with some scores near one end, and others near the halfway mark.<ref>[http://allpsych.com/personalitysynopsis/trait_application.html The OCEAN of Personality] Personality Synopsis, Chapter 4: Trait Theory. AllPsych Online. Last updated March 23, 2004</ref> Ambiversion is falling more or less directly in the middle.<ref name= "mw"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4305_14 |title=Ambiversion: Characteristics of Midrange Responders on the Introversion-Extraversion Continuum |year=1979 |last1=Cohen |first1=Donald |last2=Schmidt |first2=James P. |journal=Journal of Personality Assessment |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=514–6 |pmid=16367029}}</ref> An ambivert is moderately comfortable with groups and social interaction, but also relishes time alone, away from a crowd.
In simpler words, an ambivert is a person whose behaviour changes according to the situation they are in. In the face of authority or in the presence of strangers, the person may be introverted. However, in the presence of family or close friends, the person may be highly energetic or extraverted.

===Relative prevalence===
Cain further reports that studies indicate that 33 to 50% of the American population are introverts.<ref name="Forbes20120126">Cain, Susan (2012), ''Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking'' at page 3 (Introduction) and page 280 (note 11). • Goudreau, Jenna, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/01/26/the-secret-power-of-introverts/print/ "The Secret Power Of Introverts"] ([https://www.webcitation.org/669Gfc27l?url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/01/26/the-secret-power-of-introverts/ WebCite archive]), ''[[Forbes]]'', January 26, 2012.</ref> Particular subpopulations have higher prevalence, with a 6,000-subject [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator|MBTI]]-based survey indicating that 60% of attorneys, and 90% of [[intellectual property]] attorneys, are introverts.<ref name=ABAjournal20160101>{{cite web |author=Gordon, Leslie A. |url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/most_lawyers_are_introverted_and_thats_not_necessarily_a_bad_thing/ |title=Most lawyers are introverted, and that's not necessarily a bad thing |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108193354/http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/most_lawyers_are_introverted_and_thats_not_necessarily_a_bad_thing/ |others=Archived at the [[Wayback Machine]] |work=[[ABA Journal]] |date=January 1, 2016 |archive-date=2016-01-08}}</ref>

==Measurement==
The extent of extraversion and introversion is most commonly assessed through self-report measures, although peer-reports and third-party observation can also be used. Self-report measures are either lexical<ref name="Thompson" /> or based on statements.<ref name="Goldbergetal">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2005.08.007 |title=The international personality item pool and the future of public-domain personality measures |year=2006 |last1=Goldberg |first1=Lewis R. |last2=Johnson |first2=John A. |last3=Eber |first3=Herbert W. |last4=Hogan |first4=Robert |last5=Ashton |first5=Michael C. |last6=Cloninger |first6=C. Robert |last7=Gough |first7=Harrison G. |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=84–96}}</ref> The type of measure is determined by an assessment of [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] properties, and the time and space constraints of the research being undertaken.

=== Lexical self-reporting ===
Lexical measures use individual adjectives that reflect extravert and introvert traits, such as outgoing, talkative, reserved and quiet. Words representing introversion are reverse-coded to create composite measures of extraversion-introversion running on a continuum. Goldberg (1992)<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1040-3590.4.1.26 |title=The development of markers for the Big-Five factor structure |year=1992 |last1=Goldberg |first1=Lewis R. |journal=Psychological Assessment |volume=4 |pages=26–42 |issue=1}}</ref> developed a 20-word measure as part of his 100-word [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] markers. Saucier (1994)<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa6303_8 |title=Mini-Markers: A Brief Version of Goldberg's Unipolar Big-Five Markers |year=1994 |last1=Saucier |first1=Gerard |journal=Journal of Personality Assessment |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=506–16 |pmid=7844738}}</ref> developed a briefer 8-word measure as part of his 40-word mini-markers. However, the psychometric properties of Saucier's original mini-markers have been found to be suboptimal with samples outside of North America.<ref name="Thompson" /> As a result, a systematically revised measure was developed to have better psychometric properties, the International English Mini-Markers.<ref name="Thompson" /> The International English Mini-Markers has good [[internal consistency]] reliabilities, and other [[Validity (statistics)|validity]], for assessing extraversion-introversion and other five-factor personality dimensions, both within and, especially, without American populations. Internal consistency reliability of the extraversion measure for native English-speakers is reported as a [[Cronbach's alpha]] (α) of 0.92, that for non-native English-speakers is α of 0.85.

=== Statement self-reporting ===
Statement measures tend to contain more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked the extent to which they, for example, "Talk to a lot of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others".<ref name="Goldbergetal" /> While some statement-based measures of extraversion-introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0022022197282001 |title=Cross-Cultural Generalizability of the Five-Factor Model of Personality: Development and Validation of the NEO PI-R for Koreans |year=1997 |last1=Piedmont |first1=R. L. |last2=Chae |first2=J.-H. |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=131–155|s2cid=145053137 }}</ref> For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited for use outside America. For instance, statements like "Keep in the background" and "Know how to captivate people" are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, except in a literal sense.

===Eysenck's theory===
[[Hans Eysenck]] described extraversion-introversion as the degree to which a person is outgoing and interactive with other people. These behavioral differences are presumed to be the result of underlying differences in brain physiology.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eysenck |first1=H. J. |year=1967 |title=The biological basis of personality |location=Springfield, IL |publisher=Thomas Publishing}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> Eysenck associated [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] inhibition and excitation with the [[ascending reticular activation system]] (ARAS), a pathway located in the [[brainstem]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bullock|first1=W. A.|last2=Gilliland|first2=K.|date=1993|title=Eysenck's arousal theory of introversion-extraversion: A converging measures investigation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=64|issue=1|pages=113–123|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.1.113|pmid=8421248}}</ref> Extraverts seek excitement and social activity in an effort to raise their naturally low arousal level, whereas introverts tend to avoid social situations in an effort to avoid raising their naturally high arousal level too far. Eysenck designated extraversion as one of three major traits in his P-E-N model of personality, which also includes [[psychoticism]] and [[neuroticism]].

Eysenck originally suggested that extraversion was a combination of two major tendencies, impulsiveness and sociability. He later added several other more specific traits, namely liveliness, activity level, and excitability. These traits are further linked in his personality hierarchy to even more specific habitual responses, such as partying on the weekend.

Eysenck compared this trait to the [[four temperaments]] of ancient medicine, with choleric and sanguine temperaments equating to extraversion, and melancholic and phlegmatic temperaments equating to introversion.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Laura |last1=Parish |date=November 1965 |title=The Eysenck Personality Inventory by H. J. Eysenck; S. G. B. Eysenck |journal=British Journal of Educational Studies |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=140 |jstor=3119050 |doi=10.2307/3119050}}</ref>

[[Image:Retos-twins.jpg|thumb|[[Twin studies]] indicate that extraversion-introversion has a [[Genetics|genetic]] component]]

===Biological factors===
The relative importance of [[nature versus nurture|nature versus environment]] in determining the level of extraversion is controversial and the focus of many studies. [[Twin studies]] have found a genetic component of 39% to 58%. In terms of the environmental component, the shared family environment appears to be far less important than individual environmental factors that are not shared between siblings.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1031 |title=Personality similarity in twins reared apart and together |year=1988 |last1=Tellegen |first1=Auke |last2=Lykken |first2=David T. |last3=Bouchard Jr |first3=Thomas J. |last4=Wilcox |first4=Kimerly J. |last5=Segal |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=1031–9 |pmid=3397862 |first5=NL |last6=Rich |first6=S|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.4777 }}</ref>

Eysenck proposed that extraversion was caused by variability in cortical arousal. He hypothesized that introverts are characterized by higher levels of activity than extraverts and so are chronically more cortically aroused than extraverts. That extraverts require more external stimulation than introverts has been interpreted as evidence for this hypothesis. Other evidence of the "stimulation" hypothesis is that introverts salivate more than extraverts in response to a drop of lemon juice. This is due to increased activity in their ARAS, which responds to stimuli like food or social contact.<ref name="ras">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/personalityandindividuality/lemons.shtml | title=Lemon juice experiment | work=BBC | access-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref>

Extraversion has been linked to higher sensitivity of the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic dopamine system]] to potentially rewarding stimuli.<ref name="pmid-11301519">{{cite journal |pmid=11301519 |year=1999 |last1=Depue |first1=RA |last2=Collins |first2=PF |title=Neurobiology of the structure of personality: Dopamine, facilitation of incentive motivation, and extraversion |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=491–517; discussion 518–69 |journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences |doi=10.1017/S0140525X99002046}}</ref> This in part explains the high levels of positive affect found in extraverts, since they will more intensely feel the excitement of a potential reward. One consequence of this is that extraverts can more easily learn the contingencies for [[positive reinforcement]], since the reward itself is experienced as greater.

One study found that introverts have more blood flow in the [[frontal lobe]]s of their brain and the anterior or frontal [[thalamus]], which are areas dealing with internal processing, such as planning and problem solving. Extraverts have more blood flow in the [[anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate gyrus]], [[temporal lobe]]s, and posterior thalamus, which are involved in sensory and emotional experience.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9989562 |year=1999 |last1=Johnson |first1=DL |last2=Wiebe |first2=JS |last3=Gold |first3=SM |last4=Andreasen |first4=NC |last5=Hichwa |first5=RD |last6=Watkins |first6=GL |last7=Boles Ponto |first7=LL |title=Cerebral blood flow and personality: A positron emission tomography study |volume=156 |issue=2 |pages=252–7 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |doi=10.1176/ajp.156.2.252|doi-broken-date=November 11, 2020|url=https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ajp.156.2.252 }}</ref> This study and other research indicate that introversion-extraversion is related to individual differences in brain function. A study on regional brain volume found a positive correlation between introversion and [[grey matter]] volume in the right [[prefrontal cortex]] and right [[temporoparietal junction]], as well as a positive correlation between introversion and total [[white matter]] volume.<ref name="Forsman, Lea J., et al. 2012">Forsman, L.

Extraversion has also been linked to physiological factors such as respiration, through its association with [[surgency]].<ref name="Shiner & Caspi">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00101 |title=Personality differences in childhood and adolescence: Measurement, development, and consequences |year=2003 |last1=Shiner |first1=Rebecca |last2=Caspi |first2=Avshalom |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=44 |pages=2–32 |pmid=12553411 |issue=1}}</ref>

==Behaviour==
Various differences in behavioural characteristics are attributed to extraverts and introverts. According to one study, extraverts tend to wear more decorative clothing, whereas introverts prefer practical, comfortable clothes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sharma |first1=R. S. |year=1980 |title=Clothing behaviour, personality, and values: A correlational study |journal=Psychological Studies |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=137–42}}</ref> Extraverts are more likely to prefer more upbeat, conventional, and energetic music than introverts.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.6.1236 |title=The do re mi's of everyday life: The structure and personality correlates of music preferences |year=2003 |last1=Rentfrow |first1=Peter J. |last2=Gosling |first2=Samuel D. |s2cid=16489081 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=1236–56 |pmid=12793587}}</ref> Personality also influences how people arrange their work areas. In general, extraverts decorate their offices more, keep their doors open, keep extra chairs nearby, and are more likely to put dishes of candy on their desks. These are attempts to invite co-workers and encourage interaction. Introverts, in contrast, decorate less and tend to arrange their workspace to discourage social interaction.<ref>Gosling, S. (2008). ''Snoop''. New York: Basic Books.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>

Despite these differences, a meta-analysis of 15 experience sampling studies has suggested that there is a great deal of overlap in the way that extraverts and introverts behave.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Fleeson, W.|author2=Gallagher, P.|title=The Implications of Big Five Standing for the Distribution of Trait Manifestation in Behavior: Fifteen Experience-Sampling Studies and a Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2009|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1097–1114|doi=10.1037/a0016786|pmid=19968421|pmc=2791901}}</ref> In these studies, participants used mobile devices to report how extraverted (e.g., bold, talkative, assertive, outgoing) they were acting at multiple times during their daily lives. Fleeson and Gallagher (2009) found that extraverts regularly behave in an introverted way, and introverts regularly behave in an extraverted way. Indeed, there was more within-person variability than between-person variability in extraverted behaviours. The key feature that distinguishes extraverts and introverts was that extraverts tend to act moderately extraverted about 5–10% more often than introverts. From this perspective, extraverts and introverts are not "fundamentally different". Rather, an "extravert" is just someone who acts more extraverted more often, suggesting that extraversion is more about what one "does" than what one "has".

Additionally, a study by Lippa (1978) found evidence for the extent to which individuals present themselves in a different way. This is called expressive behaviour, and it is dependent upon the individuals' motivation and ability to control that behaviour. Lippa (1978) examined 68 students who were asked to role-play by pretending to teach a math class. The students' level of extraversion and introversion were rated based on their external/expressive behaviours such as stride length, graphic expansiveness, the percentage of time they spent talking, the amount of time they spent making eye contact, and the total time of each teaching session. This study found that actual introverts were perceived and judged as having more extraverted-looking expressive behaviours because they were higher in terms of their self-monitoring.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lippa|first1=R.|date=1978|title=Expressive control, expressive consistency, and the correspondence between expressive behavior and personality|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=46|issue=3|pages=438–461|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1978.tb01011.x}}</ref> This means that the introverts consciously put more effort into presenting a more extraverted, and rather socially desirable, version of themselves. Thus, individuals are able to regulate and modify behaviour based on their environmental situations.

Humans are complex and unique, and because introversion-extraversion varies along a continuum, individuals may have a mixture of both orientations. A person who acts introverted in one situation may act extraverted in another, and people can learn to act in "counter dispositional" ways in certain situations. For example, Brian Little's free trait theory<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=B. R.|title=Free traits, personal projects and idio-tapes: Three tiers for personality research.|journal=Psychological Inquiry|date=1996|volume=8|issue=4|pages=340–344|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0704_6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=B. R.|title= Personal Projects and Free Traits: Personality and Motivation Reconsidered|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|date=2008|volume=2|issue=3|pages=1235–1254|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2008.00106.x}}</ref> suggests that people can take on "free traits", behaving in ways that may not be their "first nature", but can strategically advance projects that are important to them. Together, this presents an optimistic view of what extraversion is. Rather than being fixed and stable, individuals vary in their extraverted behaviours across different moments, and can choose to act extraverted to advance important personal projects or even increase their happiness, as mentioned above.

==Implications==
Acknowledging that introversion and extraversion are normal variants of behavior can help in self-acceptance and understanding of others. For example, an extravert can accept their introverted partner's need for solitude, while an introvert can acknowledge their extraverted partner's need for social interaction.

Researchers have found a correlation between extraversion and self-reported happiness. That is, more extraverted people tend to report higher levels of happiness than introverts.<ref>Myers, David G (1992).

This does not mean that introverts are unhappy. Extraverts simply report experiencing more positive emotions, whereas introverts tend to be closer to neutral. This may be because extraversion is socially preferable in contemporary Western culture and thus introversion feels less desirable. In addition to the research on happiness, other studies have found that extraverts tend to report higher levels of [[self-esteem]] than introverts.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00080-1 |title=Direct or indirect, that is the question: A re-evaluation of extraversion's influence on self-esteem |year=2004 |last1=Swickert |first1=Rhonda |last2=Hittner |first2=James B. |last3=Kitos |first3=Nicole |last4=Cox-Fuenzalida |first4=Luz-Eugenia |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=207–17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00078-8 |title=Personality, self-esteem, and demographic predictions of happiness and depression |year=2003 |last1=Cheng |first1=Helen |last2=Furnham |first2=Adrian |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=921–42}}</ref> Others suggest that such results reflect [[Cultural anthropology|socio-cultural]] bias in the survey itself.<ref name="Laney, Marti Olsen 2002"/> Dr. David Meyers has claimed that happiness is a matter of possessing three traits: self-esteem, [[optimism]], and extraversion. Meyers bases his conclusions on studies that report extraverts to be happier; these findings have been questioned in light of the fact that the "happiness" prompts given to the studies' subjects, such as "I like to be with others" and "I'm fun to be with," only measure happiness among extraverts.<ref name="Laney, Marti Olsen 2002"/> Also, according to Carl Jung, introverts acknowledge more readily their psychological needs and problems, whereas extraverts tend to be oblivious to them because they focus more on the outer world.<ref name="Psychologist he" />

Although extraversion is perceived as socially desirable in Western culture, it is not always an advantage. For example, extraverted youths are more likely to engage in antisocial or [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquent]] behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Extraversion, neurotiscism, psychoticism and self-reported delinquency: evidence from eight separate samples |year=1981 |last1=Rushton |first1= Philippe |last2=Chrisjohn |first2=Roland |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=11–20 |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(81)90047-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ryckman |first1=R. |year=2004 |title=Theories of Personality |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]]}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> In line with this, certain evidence suggest that the trait of extraversion may also be related to that of [[psychopathy]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Passive avoidance in syndromes of disinhibition: psychopathy and extraversion |year=1985 |last1=Newman |first1= Joseph |last2=Widom |first2=Cathy |last3=Nathan |first3=Stuart |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=1316–1327 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.48.5.1316}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Survey of the relationship between five factor model and psychopathic personality in a sample of male prisoners in Iran |year=2011 |last1=Ghaderi |first1= Davod |last2=Borjali |first2=Ahmad |last3=Bahrami |first3=Hadi |last4=Sohrabi |first4=Faramarz |journal=Annals of Biological Research |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=116–122}}</ref> Conversely, while introversion is perceived as less socially desirable, it is strongly associated with positive traits such as intelligence<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(97)00169-4 |title=Personality and intelligence |year=1998 |last1=Furnham |first1=Adrian |last2=Forde |first2=Liam |last3=Cotter |first3=Tim |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=187–92}}</ref> and "giftedness."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gallagher |first1=S.

Research shows that [[behavioral immune system]], the psychological processes that infer infection risk from perceptual cues and respond to these perceptual cues through the activation of aversive emotions,  may influence gregariousness. Although extraversion is associated with many positive outcomes like higher levels of happiness, those extraverted people are also more likely to be exposed to [[communicable diseases]], such as [[Airborne disease|airborne infections]], as they tend to have more contact with people. When individuals are more vulnerable to infection, the cost of being social will be relatively greater. Therefore, people tend to be less extraversive when they feel vulnerable and vice versa.<ref name="Schaller">{{cite journal |last1=Schaller |first1=Mark  |date= 31 October 2011 |title=The behavioural immune system and the psychology of human sociality|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B |volume=366 |issue=1583|pages=3418–3426|doi=10.1098/rstb.2011.0029|pmid=22042918  |pmc=3189350}}</ref>

Although neither introversion nor extraversion is pathological, [[psychotherapist]]s can take temperament into account when treating clients. Clients may respond better to different types of treatment depending on where they fall on the introversion-extraversion spectrum. Teachers can also consider temperament when dealing with their pupils, for example acknowledging that introverted children need more encouragement to speak in class while extraverted children may grow restless during long periods of quiet study.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Researchers have found that people who live on islands tend to be less extraverted (more introverted) than those living on the mainland, and that people whose ancestors had inhabited the island for twenty generations tend to be less extraverted than more recent arrivals.

===Instrumental view===
The instrumental view proposes that [[Trait theory|personality traits]] give rise to conditions and actions, which have affective consequences, and thus generate individual differences in emotionality.<ref name=Zelenski /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=D. |year=2000 |title=Mood and Temperament |location=New York, NY |publisher=Guilford Press}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>

====Personality trait as a cause of higher sociability====
According to the instrumental view, one explanation for greater [[subjective well-being]] among extraverts could be that extraversion helps in the creation of life circumstances, which promote high levels of [[Positive affectivity|positive affect]]. Specifically, the personality trait of extraversion is seen as a facilitator of more social interactions,<ref name=McCrae /><ref name=Zelenski /><ref name=Lucas>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2008.00490.x |title=Explaining the Extraversion/Positive Affect Relation: Sociability Cannot Account for Extraverts' Greater Happiness |year=2008 |last1=Lucas |first1=Richard E. |last2=Le |first2=Kimdy |last3=Dyrenforth |first3=Portia S. |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=385–414 |pmid=18399958}}</ref> since the low cortical arousal among extraverts results in them seeking more social situations in order to increase their arousal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eysenck |first1=H.

====Social activity hypothesis====
According to the social activity hypothesis, more frequent participation in social situations creates more frequent, and higher levels, of [[Positive affectivity|positive affect]]. Therefore, it is believed that since extraverts are characterized as more sociable than introverts, they also possess higher levels of [[Positive affectivity|positive affect]] brought on by social interactions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=A. |last2=Converse |first2=P. |last3=Rodgers |first3=W. |year=1976 |title=The quality of American life |url=https://archive.org/details/qualityofamerica0000camp |url-access=registration |location=New York, NY |publisher=Sage}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Eysenck |first1=H.

Also, in the study of [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Argyle]] and Lu (1990)<ref name=Argyle /> extraverts were found to be less likely to avoid participation in noisy social activities, and to be more likely to participate in social activities such as party games, jokes, or going to the cinema. Similar results were reported by [[Ed Diener|Diener]], [http://randy.larsen.socialpsychology.org/ Larsen], and Emmons (1984)<ref name=Diener2>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.3.580 |title=Person × Situation interactions: Choice of situations and congruence response models |year=1984 |last1=Diener |first1=Ed |last2=Larsen |first2=Randy J. |last3=Emmons |first3=Robert A. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=580–92 |pmid=6491870}}</ref> who found that extraverts seek social situations more often than introverts, especially when engaging in recreational activities.

However, a variety of findings contradict the claims of the social activity hypothesis. Firstly, it was found that extraverts were happier than introverts even when alone. Specifically, extraverts tend to be happier regardless of whether they live alone or with others, or whether they live in a vibrant city or quiet rural environment.<ref name=Pavot /> Similarly, a study by [[Ed Diener|Diener]], Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992)<ref name=Diener /> showed that although extraverts chose social jobs relatively more frequently (51%) than nonsocial jobs compared to introverts (38%), they were happier than introverts regardless of whether their occupations had social or nonsocial character. Secondly, it was found that extraverts only sometimes reported greater amounts of social activity than introverts,<ref name=Diener2 /> but in general extraverts and introverts do not differ in the quantity of their socialization.<ref name=Pavot /> Similar finding was reported by Srivastava, Angelo, and Vallereux (2008),<ref name=Srivastava>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2008.05.002 |title=Extraversion and positive affect: A day reconstruction study of person–environment transactions |year=2008 |last1=Srivastava |first1=Sanjay |last2=Angelo |first2=Kimberly M. |last3=Vallereux |first3=Shawn R. |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=1613–8}}</ref> who found that extraverts and introverts both enjoy participating in social interactions, but extraverts participate socially more. Thirdly, studies have shown that both extraverts and introverts participate in social relations, but that the quality of this participation differs. The more frequent social participation among extraverts could be explained by the fact that extraverts know more people, but those people are not necessarily their close friends, whereas introverts, when participating in social interactions, are more selective and have only few close friends with whom they have special relationships.<ref name=Hills />

====Social attention theory====
Yet another explanation of the high [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between extraversion and happiness comes from the study by Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen (2002).<ref name="Ashton, M. C. 2002">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.1.245 |title=What is the central feature of extraversion? Social attention versus reward sensitivity |year=2002 |last1=Ashton |first1=Michael C. |last2=Lee |first2=Kibeom |last3=Paunonen |first3=Sampo V. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=83 |pages=245–52 |pmid=12088129 |issue=1}}</ref> They suggested that the core element of extraversion is a tendency to behave in ways that attract, hold, and enjoy social attention, and not reward sensitivity. They claimed that one of the fundamental qualities of social attention is its potential of being rewarding. Therefore, if a person shows positive emotions of [[enthusiasm]], energy, and excitement, that person is seen favorably by others and he or she gains others' attention. This favorable reaction from others likely encourages extraverts to engage in further extraverted behavior.<ref name="Ashton, M. C. 2002"/> Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen's (2002)<ref name="Ashton, M. C. 2002"/> study showed that their measure of social attention, the Social Attention Scale, was much more highly [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with extraversion than were measures of reward sensitivity.

===Temperamental view===
[[Temperament]]al view is based on the notion that there is a direct link between people's [[Trait theory|personality traits]] and their sensitivity to positive and negative affects.<ref name=McCrae /><ref name=Larsen /><ref name=Zelenski />

====Affective reactivity model====
The affective reactivity model states that the strength of a person's reactions to affect-relevant events are caused by people's differences in [[Affect (psychology)|affect]].<ref name=Larsen /><ref name=Tellegen>{{cite book |last1=Tellegen |first1=A. |year=1985 |chapter=Structures of mood and personality and their relevance to assessing anxiety, with an emphasis on self-report |editor1-first=A. H. |editor1-last=Tuma |editor2-first=J. D. |editor2-last=Maser |title=Anxiety and the anxiety disorders |pages=681–706 |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum}}</ref> This model is based on the [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] by [[Jeffrey Alan Gray]], which states that people with stronger behavioral activation system ([[Reinforcement sensitivity theory|BAS]]) are high in reward responsiveness and are predisposed to the personality trait of extraversion, while people with a stronger behavioral inhibition system ([[Reinforcement sensitivity theory|BIS]]) are lower in reward responsiveness and are more predisposed to personality trait of [[neuroticism]] and introversion.<ref name=Gray>{{cite book |last1=Gray |first1=J. A. |year=1994 |chapter=Personality dimensions and emotion systems |editor1-first=P. |editor1-last=Ekman |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Davidson |title=The nature of emotions: Fundamental questions |url=https://archive.org/details/natureemotionfun00ekma |url-access=limited |pages=[https://archive.org/details/natureemotionfun00ekma/page/n323 329]–31 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Therefore, extraverts are seen as having a [[temperament]]al predisposition to [[Positive affectivity|positive affect]] since positive [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] induction has a greater effect on them than on introverts, thus extraverts are more prone to react to pleasant effects.<ref name="pmid-11301519"/><ref name=Larsen /><ref name=Tellegen /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0146167200268008 |title=Action, Emotion, and Personality: Emerging Conceptual Integration |year=2000 |last1=Carver |first1=C. S. |last2=Sutton |first2=S. K. |last3=Scheier |first3=M. F. |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=741–51|s2cid=144235545 }}</ref><ref name=Rusting /> For example, Gable, Reis, and Elliot (2000).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.6.1135 |title=Behavioral activation and inhibition in everyday life |year=2000 |last1=Gable |first1=Shelly L. |last2=Reis |first2=Harry T. |last3=Elliot |first3=Andrew J. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=1135–49 |pmid=10870914}}</ref> found in two consecutive studies that people with more sensitive [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory|BIS]] reported higher levels of average negative affect, while people with more sensitive [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory|BAS]] reported higher levels of positive affect. Also, Zelenski and Larsen (1999)<ref name=Zelenski /> found that people with more sensitive [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory|BAS]] reported more positive emotions during the positive mood induction, while people with more sensitive [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory|BIS]] reported more negative emotions during the negative mood induction.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Social reactivity theory====
The social reactivity theory alleges that all humans, whether they like it or not, are required to participate in social situations. Since extraverts prefer engaging in social interactions more than introverts, they also derive more [[Positive affectivity|positive affect]] from such situations than introverts do.<ref name=Pavot /><ref name=Argyle /><ref name=Diener2 /> The support for this theory comes from work of Brian R. Little, who popularized concept of "restorative niches". Little claimed that life often requires people to participate in social situations, and since acting social is out of character for introverts, it was shown to harm their well-being. Therefore, one way to preserve introverts' well-being is for them to recharge as often as possible in places where they can return to their true selves—places Little calls "restorative niches".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Little |first1=Brian R. |year=2000 |chapter=Free traits and personal contexts: Expending a social ecological model of well-being |editor1-first=W.

However, it was also found that extraverts did not respond stronger to social situations than introverts, nor did they report bigger boosts of positive affect during such interactions.<ref name=Lucas /><ref name=Srivastava />

====Affective regulation====
Another possible explanation for more happiness among extraverts comes from the fact that extraverts are able to better regulate their [[Affect (psychology)|affective states]]. This means that in ambiguous situations (situations where positive and negative moods are introduced and mixed in similar proportions) extraverts show a slower decrease of positive affect, and, as a result, they maintained a more positive affect balance than introverts.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00405.x |title=Why Extraverts Are Happier Than Introverts: The Role of Mood Regulation |year=2006 |last1=Lischetzke |first1=Tanja |last2=Eid |first2=Michael |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=1127–61 |pmid=16787431}}</ref> Extraverts may also choose activities that facilitate happiness (e.g., recalling pleasant vs. unpleasant memories) more than introverts when anticipating difficult tasks.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2008.00554.x |title=Differential Preferences for Happiness: Extraversion and Trait-Consistent Emotion Regulation |year=2009 |last1=Tamir |first1=Maya |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=447–70 |pmid=19220724}}</ref>

====The set-point model a.k.a. affect-level model====
According to the set-point model, levels of positive and negative affects are more or less fixed within each individual, hence, after a positive or negative event, people's moods tend to go back to the pre-set level. According to the set-point model, extraverts experience more happiness because their pre-set level of positive affect is set higher than the pre-set point of positive affect in introverts, therefore extraverts require less positive reinforcement in order to feel happy.<ref name=Rusting>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)00157-N |title=Moods as sources of stimulation: Relationships between personality and desired mood states |year=1995 |last1=Rusting |first1=Cheryl L. |last2=Larsen |first2=Randy J. |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=321–329}}</ref>

====Pleasure-arousal relation====
A study by [[Peter Kuppens]] (2008)<ref name=Kuppens>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2007.10.007 |title=Individual differences in the relationship between pleasure and arousal |year=2008 |last1=Kuppens |first1=Peter |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=1053–9}}</ref> showed that extraverts and introverts engage in different behaviors when feeling pleasant, which may explain underestimation of the frequency and intensity of happiness exhibited by introverts. Specifically, Kuppens (2008)<ref name="Kuppens"/> found that arousal and pleasantness are positively [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] for extraverts, which means that pleasant feelings are more likely to be accompanied by high arousal for extraverts. On the other hand, arousal and pleasantness are negatively [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] for introverts, resulting in introverts exhibiting low arousal when feeling pleasant. In other words, if everything is going well in an extravert's life, which is a source of pleasant feelings, extraverts see such a situation as an opportunity to engage in active behavior and goal pursuit, which brings about an active, aroused pleasant state. When everything is going well for introverts, they see it as an opportunity to let down their guard, resulting in them feeling relaxed and content.<ref name="Kuppens"/>

===Complications to the extraversion-happiness correlation===

Though extraversion has consistently been shown to have a strong correlation with happiness and well-being, these findings are complicated by the presence of other personality traits that act as strong indicators of happiness.

====Neuroticism and extraversion====
In multiple studies, neuroticism has been shown to have an equal, if not larger, impact on happiness and subjective well-being than extraversion. One study classified school children into four categories based on their scores in assessments of extraversion and emotional stability (neuroticism).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=R|last2=Bradley|first2=M.T.|title=Social withdrawal: self-efficacy, happiness, and popularity in introverted and extraverted adolescents.|journal=Canadian Journal of School Psychology|date=2008|volume=14|issue=1|pages=21–35|doi=10.1177/082957359801400103|s2cid=143483585}}</ref> The results showed no significant difference between the happiness levels of stable introverts and stable extraverts, while unstable extraverts and introverts both demonstrated significantly less happiness than their counterparts. In this study, neuroticism appeared to be the more salient factor for overall well-being.

Likewise, in later studies, researchers used assessment scales to test for categories such as self-esteem and life-goal orientation, which they had positively correlated with happiness. Participants' responses to these scales suggested that neuroticism actually had a larger impact than extraversion in measures of well-being.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hills|first1=P.|last2=Argyle|first2=M.|title=Happiness, introversion-extraversion and happy introverts|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2001|volume=30|issue=4|pages=595–608|doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(00)00058-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hills|first1=P|last2=Argyle|first2=M|title=Emotional stability as a major dimension of happiness|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1357–1364|doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(00)00229-4|year=2001}}</ref>

====Other Big 5 factors and extraversion====
Though extraversion and neuroticism seem to have the largest effect on personal happiness, other Big 5 personality factors have also been shown to correlate with happiness and subjective well-being. For example, one study showed that conscientiousness and agreeableness correlated about 0.20 with subjective well-being.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=DeNeve|first1=KM|last2=Cooper|first2=H|s2cid=13614077|title=The happy personality: A meta-analysis of 137 personality traits and subjective well-being.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1998|volume=124|issue=2|pages=197–229|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197|pmid=9747186}}</ref> While the effect of these traits was not as strong as extraversion or neuroticism, it is clear that they still have some impact on happiness outcomes.

Similarly, interactions between extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness have demonstrated significant impacts on subjective well-being. In one study, researchers used three scales to assess subjective well-being. They found that extraversion only served as a predictor for one assessment, in conjunction with neuroticism, while the other two assessment outcomes were better predicted by conscientiousness and neuroticism.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=N|last2=Joseph|first2=S|title=Big 5 correlates of three measures of subjective well-being|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=34|issue=4|pages=723–727|doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(02)00057-0|year=2003}}</ref> In addition to the importance of including other factors in happiness assessments, this study also demonstrates the manner in which an operational definition of well-being changes whether extraversion emerges as a salient predictive factor.

====Other contributing personality factors====
There is also evidence that other non-trait elements of personality may correlate with happiness. For instance, one study demonstrated that various features of one's goals, such as progress towards important goals or conflicts between them, can affect both emotional and cognitive well-being.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Emmons|first1=RA|title= Personal strivings: An approach to personality and subjective well-being|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1986|volume=51|issue=5|pages=1058–68|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.5.1058}}</ref> Several other researchers have also suggested that, at least in more individualistic cultures, having a coherent sense of one's personality (and acting in a way that conforms to that self-concept) is positively related to well-being.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cantor|first1=N|last2=Sanderson|first2=CA|title=Life task participation and well-being: the importance of taking part in daily life|journal=Well-Being: Foundations of Hedonic Psychology|date=1999|pages=230–243}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Higgins|first1=ET|last2=Grant|first2=H|last3=Shah|first3=J|title=Self regulation and quality of life: emotional and non-emotional life experiences|journal=Well-Being: Foundations of Hedonic Psychology|pages=244–266}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scheier|first1=MF|last2=Carver|first2=CS|title=On the power of positive thinking: the benefits of being optimistic|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=1993|volume=2|issue=1|pages=26–30|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770572|s2cid=145393172}}</ref> Thus, focusing solely on extraversion—or even extraversion and neuroticism—is likely to provide an incomplete picture of the relationship between happiness and personality.

====Culture====
In addition, one's culture may also influence happiness and overall subjective well-being. The overall level of happiness fluctuates from culture to culture, as does preferred expression of happiness. Comparing various international surveys across countries reveals that different nations, and different ethnic groups within nations, exhibit differences in average [[life satisfaction]].

For example, one researcher found that between 1958 and 1987, Japanese life satisfaction fluctuated around 6 on a 10-point scale, while Denmark's fluctuated around 8.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Veenhoven|first1=R|title=Happiness in Nations: Subjective Appreciation of Life in 56 Nations 1946–1992|date=1993|publisher=Erasmus University|location=Rotterdam, The Netherlands}}</ref> Comparing ethnic groups within the United States, another study found that European Americans reported being "significantly happier" with their lives than Asian Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Oishi|first1=S|title=Culture and memory for emotional experiences: on-line vs. retrospective judgments of subjective well-being.|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering|date=2001|volume=61}}</ref>

Researchers have hypothesized a number of factors that could be responsible for these differences between countries, including national differences in overall income levels, self-serving biases and self-enhancement, and approach and avoidance orientations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Diener|first1=E|last2=Oishi|first2=S|last3=Lucas|first3=R|title=Personality, Culture, and Subjective Well-Being: Emotional and Cognitive Evaluations Of Life|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=2003|volume=54|pages=403–425|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145056|pmid=12172000}}</ref> Taken together, these findings suggest that while extraversion-introversion does have a strong correlation with happiness, it does not stand alone as a sole predictor of subjective well-being, and that other factors must be accounted for when trying to determine the correlates of happiness.
