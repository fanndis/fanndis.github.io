The '''second May ministry''' was formed on 11 June 2017 after [[Queen Elizabeth II]] invited [[Theresa May]] to form a government following the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017 snap general election]]. The election resulted in a [[hung parliament]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] losing its majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. On 9 June 2017, May announced her intention to form a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[minority government]], reliant on the [[confidence and supply]] of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]]; a finalised agreement between the two parties was signed and published on 26 June 2017.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40219030 |title=May to form 'government of certainty' with DUP backing |work=BBC News |accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40403434 |title=Conservatives agree pact with DUP to support May government |date=26 June 2017 |work=BBC News |access-date=26 June 2017 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

==History==
{{Further|Premiership of Theresa May|2017 United Kingdom general election}}
The [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 snap election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]], with the Conservative Party holding the most seats in the House of Commons, but without an overall majority. The DUP had suggested it would be able to provide a coalition or [[confidence and supply]] arrangement depending on negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/suddenly-become-important-democratic-unionist-party-could-hold/|title=Who are the DUP and will they demand a soft Brexit to prop up the Tories?|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> [[Theresa May]], incumbent Conservative prime minister, announced her intention on 9 June 2017 to form a new [[minority government]] with support from the DUP.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2017/general-election-2017-result-live-we-will-work-with-dup-friends-and-allies-in-interests-of-all-uk-says-theresa-may-35806871.html|title=General Election 2017 result live: We will work with DUP friends and allies in interests of all UK, says Theresa May|date=9 June 2017|work=The Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> Both parties have signalled that this support will be in the form of a confidence and supply agreement, rather than a formal coalition. There has been a formal legal challenge, claiming the agreement between the Tories and the DUP contravenes the [[Good Friday Agreement]] and the [[Bribery Act 2010|Bribery Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-40547775|title=Tory-DUP deal: Legal challenge launched|website=BBC News}}</ref>

On 11 June 2017, former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] described May as a "dead woman walking".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40237819 |title=Theresa May is a dead woman walking, says Osborne |work=BBC News |date=6 November 2017 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref> [[David Lidington]] disagrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40547731|title=Theresa May 'quit' stories blamed on 'warm prosecco'|website=BBC News}}</ref> Senior [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politicians stated that they plan to challenge the Conservative minority government early and to put forward alternative policies in the reply to the [[Queen's Speech]]. [[Jeremy Corbyn]] said he believed there is a majority in parliament for many issues on which Labour "is sympathetic", giving as examples the repeal of the [[Under-occupancy penalty]] ('bedroom tax'), and maintaining the triple lock on pensions and the winter fuel allowance. In an interview conducted on 11 June, Corbyn stated that he expected another election to be held within a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/11/jeremy-corbyn-labour-will-call-on-other-parties-to-defeat-government |title=Jeremy Corbyn: Labour will call on other parties to defeat government |work=The Guardian |date=11 June 2017 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40237813|title=Jeremy Corbyn: 'I can still be prime minister'|website=BBC News}}</ref>

The reshuffle saw prominent [[Brexiteer]] MPs, such as [[Boris Johnson]] and [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], retain their roles, but also resulted in the promotion of [[Damian Green]] and [[David Gauke]], politicians who had supported the remain side during the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU referendum]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/theresa-may/news/86608/damian-green-promoted-theresa|title=Damian Green promoted in Theresa May's reshuffle in hint her Brexit stance will be softened|first=Emilio|last=Casalicchio|date=11 June 2017|work=Politics Home|accessdate=11 June 2017}}</ref> Junior ministerial roles were allocated the following day, with a full list of new ministerial and government appointments confirmed on 12 June.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/election-2017-ministerial-appointments|title=Full list of new ministerial and government appointments: June 2017|date=12 June 2017|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>

On 3 July 2017, polls suggested May's popularity had dropped drastically since the election on 8 June. 60% of voters viewed May less favourable than they did during the election, and 20% more disapproved than approved of May: 31% approved her leadership, while 51% disapproved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/01/over-60-of-voters-view-theresa-may-as-pm-negatively-poll|title=Theresa May's ratings slump in wake of general election – poll|website=The Guardian}}</ref> By 7 July, [[YouGov]] gave Labour an eight-point lead over the Conservatives (46% to 38%).

Amidst the thrice rejection by parliament of [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|the agreement]] she negotiated to leave the European Union, May announced on 24 May 2019 that she would resign as leader of the Conservative Party on 7 June, though she continued to serve as a [[Caretaker government|caretaker]] until [[Boris Johnson]] was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected leader]] and asked to form [[First Johnson ministry|a new government]] on 24 July 2019.<ref name=bbc24m/>
