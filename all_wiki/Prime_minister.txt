[[File:The Prime Ministers of the Nordic Council in October 2014 - 09.jpg|thumb|Prime ministers of the Nordic and Baltic countries in 2014. From left: [[Erna Solberg]], Norway; [[Algirdas Butkevičius]], Lithuania; [[Laimdota Straujuma]], Latvia; [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]], Iceland; [[Alexander Stubb]], Finland; [[Anne Sulling]], Estonia (trade minister); [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], Denmark; [[Stefan Löfven]], Sweden.]]

A '''prime minister''' is the head of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and the leader of the [[Minister (government)|ministers]] in the [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch of [[government]], often in a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] or [[semi-presidential system]]. Under those systems, a prime minister is not the [[head of state]] of their respective state nor a monarch; rather the prime minister is the [[head of government]], serving typically under a [[monarch]] in a [[parliamentary system|hybrid of aristocratic and democratic]] government forms or a [[President (government title)|president]] in a [[Republic|republican]] form of [[government]].

In parliamentary systems fashioned after the [[Westminster system]], the prime minister is the presiding and actual [[head of government]] and head of the executive branch. In such systems, the [[head of state]] or their official representative (e.g., monarch, president, governor-general) usually holds a largely ceremonial position, although often with [[reserve power]]s.

Under some [[presidential system]]s, such as [[South Korea]] and [[Peru]], the prime minister is not the head of government; rather, he or she is only the leader or most senior member of the cabinet.

In many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and [[chairman]] of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in [[semi-presidential system]]s of government, a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the [[civil service]] and execute the directives of the [[head of state]].
{{Executive}}

The prime minister is often, but not always, a member of the Legislature or the Lower House thereof and is expected with other ministers to ensure the passage of bills through the [[legislature]]. In some [[monarchy|monarchies]] the monarch may also exercise executive powers (known as the [[royal prerogative]]) that are constitutionally vested in the crown and may be exercised without the approval of parliament.

As well as being head of government, being prime minister may require holding other roles or posts—the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], for example, is also [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]].{{notetag | Contrary to popular perception, the two posts are separate and need not be held by the one person. The last prime minister not to be First Lord of the Treasury was Lord Salisbury at the turn of the 20th century. [[10 Downing Street]] is actually the First Lord's residence, not the Prime Minister's. As Salisbury was not First Lord, he had to live elsewhere as prime minister.}} In some cases, prime ministers may choose to hold additional ministerial posts (e.g. when its portfolio is critical to that government’s mandate at the time):  during the Second World War, [[Winston Churchill]] was also [[Minister of Defence]] (although there was then no [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] at the time). Another example is the [[Thirty-fourth government of Israel]] {{as of|2019|alt=(2015-2019)}}, when [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] at one point served as the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] and those [[Ministry of Communications (Israel)|of Communications]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Foreign Affairs]], [[Regional Cooperation Minister of Israel|Regional Cooperation]], [[Ministry of Economy (Israel)|Economy]], [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Defense]] and [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Interior]].

==Etymology==
The term ''prime minister'' in its French form, ''premier ministre'', is attested in 17th Century sources referring to [[Cardinal Richelieu]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rnlnJbC2yRsC |title=Testament Politique du Cardinal Duc de Richelieu, Premier Ministre de France sous le Règne de Louïs XIII |year=1709 |access-date=16 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808195158/https://books.google.fi/books?id=rnlnJbC2yRsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=8 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> after he was named to head the royal council in 1624. The title was however informal and used alongside the equally informal ''[[Chief minister of France|principal ministre d'État]]'' ("chief minister of the state") more as a job description. After 1661, [[Louis XIV]] and his descendants refused to allow one of their ministers to be more important than the others, so the term was not in use.<ref>[http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/divers/Ancien_Régime/105343 Ancien Régime] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031044903/https://larousse.fr/encyclopedie/divers/Ancien_R%c3%a9gime/105343 |date=31 October 2018 }} in Encyclopédie Larousse ("Après 1661, Louis XIV impose une nouvelle formule, qui joue à la fois sur les ministres et sur les conseils, sans accepter la primauté d'un ministre.")</ref>

The term ''prime minister'' in the current sense originated in the 18th century in the United Kingdom when members of parliament disparagingly used the title in reference to [[Sir Robert Walpole]] (whose official title was [[First Lord of the Treasury]]). During the whole of the 18th Century, Britain was involved in a prolonged conflict with France, periodically bursting into all-out war, and Britons took outspoken pride in their "Liberty" as contrasted to the "Tyranny" of French Absolute Monarchy; therefore, being implicitly compared with Richelieu was no compliment to Walpole. Over time, however, the title became honorific and remains so in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/151304?rskey=fPLQIK&result=2&isAdvanced=false#eid|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|History of Parliamentarism}}

===Origins===
{{see|Chief Minister of England|Chief minister of France}}
The monarchs of England and the United Kingdom had ministers in whom they placed special trust and who were regarded as the head of the government. Examples were [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]; [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil, Lord Burghley]] under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]; [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]] under [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. These ministers held a variety of formal posts, but were commonly known as "the minister", the "chief minister", the "first minister" and finally the "prime minister".

The power of these ministers depended entirely on the personal favour of the monarch. Although managing the parliament was among the necessary skills of holding high office, they did not depend on a parliamentary majority for their power. Although there was a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], it was appointed entirely by the monarch, and the monarch usually presided over its meetings.

When the monarch grew tired of a first minister, he or she could be dismissed, or worse: Cromwell was executed and Clarendon driven into exile when they lost favour. Kings sometimes divided power equally between two or more ministers to prevent one minister from becoming too powerful. Late in Anne's reign, for example, the [[Tory]] ministers [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harley]] and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] shared power.

===Development===
[[File:CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The prime ministers of five members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] at the 1944 [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]].]]
In the mid 17th century, after the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651), Parliament strengthened its position relative to the monarch then gained more power through the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] in 1689.<ref>{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown.... The Bill of Rights (1689) then settled the primacy of Parliament over the monarch’s prerogatives, providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208232341/http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The monarch could no longer establish any law or impose any tax without its permission and thus the House of Commons became a part of the government. It is at this point that a modern style of prime minister begins to emerge.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Institution of Prime Minister|url=https://history.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/01/the-institution-of-prime-minister/|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom: History of Government Blog|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=1 January 2012|author=Dr Andrew Blick and Professor George Jones — No 10 guest historian series, Prime Ministers and No. 10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310152512/https://history.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/01/the-institution-of-prime-minister/|archive-date=10 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Byrum E.|title=Office of the Prime Minister|date=2015|origyear=1955|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400878260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ez7WCgAAQBAJ|chapter=The Historical Development of the Office of Prime Minister|access-date=15 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601045620/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ez7WCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|archive-date=1 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

A tipping point in the evolution of the prime ministership came with the death of Anne in 1714 and the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] to the throne. George spoke no English, spent much of his time at his home in [[Hanover]], and had neither knowledge of, nor interest in, the details of English government. In these circumstances it was inevitable that the king's first minister would become the de facto head of the government.

From 1721 this was the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] politician [[Robert Walpole]], who held office for twenty-one years. Walpole chaired cabinet meetings, appointed all the other ministers, dispensed the royal patronage and packed the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] with his supporters. Under Walpole, the doctrine of cabinet solidarity developed. Walpole required that no minister other than himself have private dealings with the king, and also that when the cabinet had agreed on a policy, all ministers must defend it in public, or resign. As a later prime minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], said, "It matters not what we say, gentlemen, so long as we all say the same thing."

Walpole always denied that he was "prime minister", and throughout the 18th century parliamentarians and legal scholars continued to deny that any such position was known to the Constitution. [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] made strenuous efforts to reclaim the personal power of the monarch, but the increasing complexity and expense of government meant that a minister who could command the loyalty of the Commons was increasingly necessary. The long tenure of the wartime prime minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1783–1801), combined with the mental illness of George III, consolidated the power of the post. The title was first referred to on government documents during the administration of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] but did not appear in the formal British [[Order of precedence]] until 1905.

The prestige of British institutions in the 19th century and the growth of the [[British Empire]] saw the British model of cabinet government, headed by a prime minister, widely copied, both in other European countries and in British colonial territories as they developed self-government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seidle|first1=F.

By the late 20th century,<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Arjomand|editor1-first=Saïd Amir|title=Constitutionalism and political reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004151741|pages=92–94|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYmmnYKEvE0C&pg=PA94|author1=Julian Go|chapter=A Globalizing Constitutionalism?, Views from the Postcolony, 1945-2000|access-date=27 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306121536/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kYmmnYKEvE0C&lpg=PA93&ots=nOUN11pmfK&pg=PA94#v=onepage&q&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=6 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How the Westminster Parliamentary System was exported around the World|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/how-the-westminster-parliamentary-system-was-exported-around-the-world|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=16 December 2013|date=2 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216190945/http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/how-the-westminster-parliamentary-system-was-exported-around-the-world|archive-date=16 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> the majority of the world's countries had a prime minister or equivalent minister, holding office under either a [[constitutional monarchy]] or a ceremonial president. The main exceptions to this system have been the United States and the presidential republics in Latin America modelled on the U.S. system, in which the president directly exercises executive authority.

[[Bahrain]]'s former prime minister, [[Sheikh]] [[Khalifah bin Sulman Al Khalifah]] occupied the post from 1970 to November 2020, making him the longest serving non-elected prime minister.

==Overview of the Office==

=== In monarchies and in republics ===
The post of prime minister may be encountered both in constitutional [[monarch]]ies (such as [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japan]], [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Prime Minister of Norway|Norway]], [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Prime Minister of Morocco|Morocco]], [[Prime Minister of Spain|Spain]],{{notetag | Although the roles of the Spanish head of government coincide with the definition of a 'prime minister', in Spain the position is in fact referred to as 'the Presidency of the Government'.}} [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Thailand]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canada]], [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australia]], [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|New Zealand]], and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]) and in [[parliamentary republic]]s, in which the head of state is an elected official (such as [[Prime Minister of Finland|Finland]], the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[Prime Minister of France|France]], [[Prime Minister of Greece|Greece]], [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Prime Minister of India|India]], [[Prime Minister of Indonesia|Indonesia (1945–1959)]], [[Taoiseach|Ireland]], [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Prime Minister of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Prime Minister of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romania]], [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Turkey (1923–2018)]]) and [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italy]]). See also "[[First Minister]]", "[[Premier]]", "[[Chief Minister]]", "[[Chancellor]]", "[[Taoiseach]]", "Minister of State (''Statsminister'')", "President of the Government", "President of the Council of Minister" and "[[Secretary of State]]": alternative titles usually equivalent in meaning to, or translated as, "prime minister".

This contrasts with the [[presidential system]], in which the [[President (government title)|president]] (or equivalent) is both the head of state and the head of the government. In some [[Presidential system|presidential]] and all [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] systems, such as those of [[Politics of France|France]], [[Politics of Russia|Russia]] or [[Politics of South Korea|South Korea]], the prime minister is an official generally appointed by the president but usually approved by the legislature and responsible for carrying out the directives of the president and managing the civil service. The head of government of the [[People's Republic of China]] is referred to as the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council]] and the premier of the [[Politics of the Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] is also appointed by the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], but requires no approval by the legislature.

Appointment of the prime minister of France requires no approval by the parliament either, but the parliament may force the resignation of the government. In these systems, it is possible for the president and the prime minister to be from different political parties if the legislature is controlled by a party different from that of the president. When it arises, such a state of affairs is usually referred to as (political) [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]].

===Entry into office===
In parliamentary systems a prime minister may enter into office by several means.

* '''The head of state appoints a prime minister, of their personal choice:''' Example: [[France]], where the President has the power to appoint the Prime Minister of their choice, though the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] can force a government to resign, they cannot nominate or appoint a new candidate.
:While in practice most prime ministers under the [[Westminster system]] (including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, [[Malaysia]], India and the United Kingdom) are the leaders of the largest party or [[Political alliance|coalition]] in parliament, technically the appointment of the prime minister is a prerogative exercised by the head of state. 
* '''The head of state appoints a prime minister who has a set timescale within which they must gain a vote of confidence:''' Example: [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Thailand]]
* '''The head of state appoints a prime minister from among the members of Parliament, who then has a set timescale within which they must form a cabinet, and receive the confidence of Parliament after presenting the Cabinet Composition and Legislative Program to Parliament:''' Example: Israel
* '''The head of state appoints the leader of the political party with the majority of the seats in the Parliament as Prime Minister.  If no party has a majority, then the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an ''exploratory mandate'' to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days.  If this is not possible, then the leader of the party with the second highest seat number is given the exploratory mandate.  If this fails, then the leader of the third largest party is given it and so on:''' Example: Greece, see [[Prime Minister of Greece]]
* '''The head of state ''nominates'' a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment as prime minister:''' Example: Spain, where the King sends a nomination to parliament for approval. Also Germany where under the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] (constitution) the [[Bundestag]] votes on a candidate nominated by the federal president. In the Philippines under the 1973 Constitution as amended after martial law, the Prime Minister was elected by the [[Batasang Pambansâ]] (Legislature) upon nomination by the President. In these cases, parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state (or, in the case of the Philippines, outright elect that candidate). 
* '''Parliament ''nominates'' a candidate who the head of state is then constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister:''' Example: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], where the [[President of Ireland|President]] appoints the [[Taoiseach]] on the nomination of [[Dáil Éireann]]. Also [[Japan]].
* '''Election by the Legislature:''' Example: [[The Philippines]] under the unamended 1973 Constitution, where the prime minister was supposed to be elected by the Batasang Pambansâ; these provisions were never used because the Philippines was under martial law at the time. Also [[Vanuatu]].
* '''Direct election by popular vote:''' Example: [[Israel]], 1996–2001, where the prime minister was elected in a general election, with no regard to political affiliation.
* '''Nomination by a state office holder other than the head of state or his/her representative:''' Example: Under the modern Swedish [[Constitution of Sweden|Instrument of Government]], the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the [[Monarch of Sweden|monarch]] to the Speaker of Parliament and the parliament itself. The speaker nominates a candidate, who is then elected to prime minister (''statsminister'') by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote no (i.e. he can be elected even if more MP:s vote ''no'' than ''yes'').

===Exit from office===
Most prime ministers in [[parliament]]ary systems are not appointed for a specific term in office and in effect may remain in power through a number of [[election]]s and parliaments. For example, [[Margaret Thatcher]] was only ever appointed prime minister on ''one'' occasion, in 1979. She remained ''continuously'' in power until 1990, though she used the assembly of each [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] after a [[general election]] to [[Cabinet reshuffle|reshuffle her cabinet]].

Some states, however, do have a term of office of the prime minister linked to the period in office of the parliament. Hence the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Taoiseach]] is formally '[[renominated]]' after every general election. (Some [[constitution]]al experts have questioned whether this process is actually in keeping with the provisions of the Irish constitution, which ''appear'' to suggest that a [[taoiseach]] should remain in office, without the requirement of a [[renomination]], unless s/he has clearly lost the general election.) The position of prime minister is normally chosen from the political party that commands majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.

In parliamentary systems, [[government]]s are generally required to have the confidence of the [[lower house|lower house of parliament]] (though a small minority of parliaments, by giving a right to block [[Loss of Supply|supply]] to [[upper house]]s, in effect make the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] responsible to both houses, though in reality upper houses, even when they have the power, rarely exercise it). Where they lose a ''[[vote of confidence]]'', have a ''[[motion of no confidence]]'' passed against them, or where they lose supply, most [[constitution]]al systems require either:

{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
 |a letter of resignation or
 |a request for parliamentary dissolution.
}}

The latter in effect allows the government to appeal the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] of parliament to the [[Constituency|electorate]]. However, in many [[jurisdiction]]s a head of state ''may'' refuse a parliamentary dissolution, requiring the resignation of the prime minister and his or her government. In most modern parliamentary systems, the prime minister is the person who decides when to request a parliamentary dissolution.

Older constitutions often vest this power in the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. In the United Kingdom, for example, the tradition whereby it is the prime minister who requests a dissolution of parliament dates back to 1918. Prior to then, it was the ''entire'' government that made the request. Similarly, though the modern 1937 Irish constitution grants to the Taoiseach the right to make the request, the earlier 1922 [[Irish Free State Constitution]] vested the power in the ''[[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]]'' (the then name for the Irish cabinet).

In [[Australia]], the Prime Minister is expected to step down if they loses the majority support of their party under a [[spill motion]] as have many such as [[Tony Abbott]], [[Julia Gillard]], [[Kevin Rudd]] and [[Malcolm Turnbull]].

===Organisational structure===
{{Main|Cabinet department}}
The Prime Minister's executive office is usually called the Office of the Prime Minister or [[Cabinet Office]]. The U.K.’s [[Cabinet Office]] includes the Prime Minister’s Office. Conversely, some Prime Minister's Offices incorporate the role of Cabinet, while Australia’s Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet joins them at par. In Israel, the Prime Minister's executive office is officially titled the "Prime Minister's Office" in English, but the original Hebrew term can also be translated as the Prime Minister's Ministry.  The Prime Minister's Department is also used, as is Cabinet Department.

===Description of the role===
[[Wilfried Martens]], who served as Prime Minister of Belgium, described his role as follows:

:First of all the Prime Minister must listen a lot, and when deep disagreements occur, he must suggest a solution to the matter. This can be done in different ways. Sometimes during the discussion, I note the elements of the problem and think of a proposal I can formulate to the Council (cabinet), the Secretary taking notes. The Ministers then insist on changing game ages. The Prime Minister can also make a proposal which leaves enough room for amendments in order to keep the current discussion on the right tracks. When a solution must be found in order to reach a consensus, he can force one or two Ministers to join or resign.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Cross-country comparative details==

===Titles===
In [[Constitution of Russia|the Russian constitution]] the prime minister is actually titled ''Chairman of the government'' while the Irish prime minister is called the {{lang|ga|[[Taoiseach]]}} (which is rendered into English as ''prime minister''), and in [[Israel]] he is ''Rosh HaMemshalah,'' meaning "head of the government". In many cases, though commonly used, "prime minister" is not the official title of the office-holder; the Spanish prime minister is the [[Prime Minister of Spain|President of the Government]] ({{lang|es|Presidente del Gobierno}}).

Other common forms include [[president of the council of ministers]] (for example in Italy, {{lang|it|Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri}}), [[Minister-President|President of the Executive Council]], or [[Minister-President]]. In the Nordic countries the prime minister is called ''Statsminister'', meaning "Minister of State". In [[federation]]s, the head of government of [[Federated state|a federated entity]] (e.g., [[Provinces and territories of Canada|a Canadian province]], [[States of Brazil|a Brazilian state]], etc.) is most commonly known as the [[premier]], [[chief minister]], [[governor]] or [[minister-president]].

The convention in the English language is to call nearly all national heads of government "prime minister" (sometimes the equivalent term "premier") except in the cases where the head of state and head of government are fused into one position, usually a presidency, regardless of the correct title of the head of government as applied in his or her respective country. The few exceptions to the rule are Germany and Austria, whose heads of government titles are almost always translated as Chancellor; Monaco, whose head of government is referred to as the Minister of State; and Vatican City, for which the head of government is titled the Secretary of State. In the case of Ireland, the head of government is occasionally referred to as the Taoiseach by English speakers. A stand-out case is the President of Iran, who is not actually a head of state, but the head of the government of Iran. He is referred to as "president" in both the [[Persian language|Persian]] and English languages.

In non-Commonwealth countries the prime minister may be entitled to the style of [[Excellency]] like a president. In some Commonwealth countries prime ministers and former prime ministers are styled [[Right Honourable]] due to their position (the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], for example). In the United Kingdom the prime minister and former prime ministers may appear to also be styled [[Right Honourable]], however this is not due to their position as head of government but as a [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] of being current members of [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council#Rights and privileges of members|Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]].<ref name=PCpage25>{{cite web |url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page25.asp |title=Privy Council Members |publisher=The Privy Council Office |accessdate=19 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925163150/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page25.asp |archivedate=25 September 2009 }}</ref>

In the UK, where devolved government is in place, the leaders of the [[Scottish Government|Scottish]], [[Northern Ireland Executive|Northern Irish]] and [[Welsh Assembly Government|Welsh]] Governments are styled [[First Minister]]. Between 1921 and 1972, when Northern Ireland was a Majority Rule Parliament the head of government would be known as the [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]]. In India, the Prime Minister is called ''Pradhān Mantrī'', literally meaning the Head of ministers or Prime Minister. In Pakistan, the prime minister is referred to as ''Wazir-e-Azam'', meaning "Grand Vizier".

The position, power and status of prime ministers differ depending on the age of the constitution.

'''Australia's''' [[Constitution of Australia|constitution]] makes no mention of a [[Prime Minister of Australia]] and the office only exists by convention, based on the British model.

'''Bangladesh's''' [[Constitution of Bangladesh|constitution]] clearly outlines the functions and powers of the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]], and also details the process of his/her appointment and dismissal.

The '''People's Republic of China''' [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] set a [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier]] just one place below the [[National People's Congress]] in China. Premier read as ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]]: 总理; [[pinyin]]: Zŏnglĭ) in Chinese.

'''Canada''' has a 'mixed' or hybrid [[Constitution of Canada|constitution]], partly formally codified and partly uncodified. The codified part originally made no reference whatsoever to a prime minister<ref>''[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-1.html Constitution Act, 1867]'' (U.K.), 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3.

Instead, her or his powers, duties, appointment and termination follow uncodified conventions. The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' only establishes the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Queen’s Privy Council for Canada]], to which all federal ministers (among others) are appointed and with Members{{Efn|Which Members, though, are left to uncodified convention.

'''India's''' [[Constitution of India|constitution]] (1950) lists the powers, functions and duties of the [[Prime Minister of India]]. In India, prime ministerial candidates must be a member of parliament, i.e. of either the Lok Sabha (Lower House) or Rajya Sabha (Upper House). No parliamentary vote takes place on who forms a government.

'''Ireland's''' [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]] (1937), provides for the office of [[Taoiseach]] in detail, listing powers, functions and duties.

'''Italy's''' [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]] (1948) lists the powers, functions and duties of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]].

'''Pakistan's''' [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]] (1973) lists the powers, functions and duties of the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]].

'''Spain's''' [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|constitution]] (1978) regulates the appointment, dismissal, powers, functions and duties of the [[Prime Minister of Spain|President of the Government]].

'''Thailand's''' [[Constitution of Thailand|constitution]] (1932) lists the powers, functions and duties of the [[Prime Minister of Thailand]].

'''Taiwan's''' [[Constitution of the Republic of China|constitution]] (1946) lists the powers, functions and duties of the [[President of the Executive Yuan]].

The '''United Kingdom's''' [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution]], being [[uncodified constitution|uncodified]] and largely unwritten, makes no mention of a [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]. Though it had ''[[de facto]]'' existed for centuries, its first mention in official state documents did not occur until the first decade of the twentieth century. Accordingly, it is often said "not to exist"; indeed there are several instances of parliament declaring this to be the case. The prime minister sits in the cabinet solely by virtue of occupying another office, either [[First Lord of the Treasury]] (office in commission) or more rarely [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (the last of whom was [[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]] in 1905). 

:In such systems unwritten (and unenforceable) constitutional conventions often outline the order in which people are asked to form a government. If the prime minister resigns after a general election, the monarch usually asks the leader of the opposition to form a government. Where however a resignation occurs during a parliament session (unless the government has itself collapsed) the monarch will ask another member of the government to form a government. While previously the monarch had some leeway in whom to ask, all British political parties now elect their leaders (until 1965 the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]s chose their leader by informal consultation). The last time the monarch had a choice over the appointment occurred in 1963 when the [[Alec Douglas-Home|Earl of Home]] was asked to become Prime Minister ahead of [[Rab Butler]].
During the period between the time it is clear that the incumbent government has been defeated at a general election, and the actual swearing-in of the new prime minister by the monarch, governor-general, or president, that person is referred to as the "prime minister-elect" or "prime minister-designate". Neither term is strictly correct from a constitutional point of view, but they have wide acceptance. In a situation in which a ruling party elects or appoints a new leader, the incoming leader will usually be referred as "prime minister-in-waiting". An example or this situation was in 2016 in the United Kingdom when [[Theresa May]] was elected leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] while [[David Cameron]] was still prime minister.

'''Ukraine's''' [[Constitution of Ukraine|constitution]] (1996) lists the powers, functions and duties of the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]].
