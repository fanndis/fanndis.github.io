He hosted the tabloid talk show ''[[Geraldo (talk show)|Geraldo]]'' from 1987 to 1998. He gained popularity with the live TV special ''[[The Mystery of Al Capone's Vaults]]''. Rivera hosted the [[news magazine]] program ''[[Geraldo at Large]]'', hosts the occasional broadcast of ''Geraldo Rivera Reports'' (in lieu of hosting ''At Large''), and appears regularly on [[Fox News]] programs such as ''[[The Five (talk show)|The Five]]''.

==Early life==
Rivera was born at [[Mount Sinai Beth Israel|Beth Israel Medical Center]] in New York City, New York, the son of Lillian (née Friedman; October 16, 1924 &ndash; June 3, 2018) and Cruz "Allen" Rivera (October 1, 1915 – November 1987), a restaurant worker and cab driver respectively.<ref name="abcexcerpt">{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/WaterCooler/story?id=4339477&page=1 |title=Excerpt: 'His Panic'|work= ABC News |date=February 26, 2008 |accessdate=September 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/59/Geraldo-Rivera.html |title=Geraldo Rivera Biography (1943-) |website=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref> Rivera is a [[Stateside Puerto Ricans|Stateside Puerto Rican]]; his father was a [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/WaterCooler/story?id=4339477&page=1 |title=Excerpt: 'His Panic' |work=ABC News |date=February 26, 2008 |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref> and his mother was of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]] descent.

Rivera's family was sometimes subjected to prejudice and racism, and his mother took to spelling their surname as "Riviera" to avoid having bigotry directed at them (and only his sister Sharon did not have her surname misspelled).<ref>{{cite book |last= Wood  |first=Jamie Martinez |date=2007 |title=Latino Writers and Journalists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIlaa0cLu2AC&q=%22geraldo+rivera%22+%22riviera%22&pg=PA195 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Facts on File, Inc. |page=195 |isbn=978-0-8160-6422-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Snopes.com|title=Fact Check: Geraldo Rivera|url=http://www.snopes.com/fact-check/geraldo-rivera/}}</ref>

<blockquote>When I was born, my mother filled in my birth certificate with the name Gerald Riviera, adding an extra "i" to my father's surname. She did the same thing for my sister Irene. Later, she would drop the pretense for my sister Sharon, only to pick it up again with the birth of my baby brother Craig. Whenever we asked about the inconsistencies, she would shrug shyly and joke her way out of it. "I just forgot how to spell it", she would say, and leave it at that. Underneath, I came to realize, she was deeply embarrassed over what was a clumsy attempt at an ethnic cover-up.</blockquote>

From 1961 to 1963, he attended the [[State University of New York Maritime College]], where he was a member of the rowing team.<ref>{{cite web|website=Geraldo.com|title=Sailing Book (continues)|url=http://www.geraldo.com/v5/Biographical/Sailing-Book-continues.gr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327103644/http://www.geraldo.com/v5/Biographical/Sailing-Book-continues.gr|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 27, 2007|date=March 27, 2007 |access-date= December 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Fort Schuyler Maritime Alumni Association|url=http://www.fsmaa.org/NFFS/1998/nf980924.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818170027/http://www.fsmaa.org/NFFS/1998/nf980924.cfm|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 18, 2007|date=August 18, 2007 |title=September 24, 1998|access-date= December 17, 2011}}</ref> Afterwards, he transferred to the [[University of Arizona]], where he continued his involvement in athletics as a goalie on the [[lacrosse]] team and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[business administration]].

Following a series of jobs ranging from clothing salesman to short-order cook, Rivera enrolled at [[Brooklyn Law School]] in 1966. As a law student, he held internships with the [[New York County District Attorney]] under legendary crime-fighter [[Frank Hogan]] and Harlem Assertion of Rights (a community-based provider of legal services) before receiving his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] near the top of his class in 1969. He then held a Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship in poverty law at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]] in the summer of 1969 before being admitted to the New York State Bar later that year.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLPrMMKmynwC&q=geraldo+rivera+smith+fellow&pg=PA364|title=Notable Caribbeans and Caribbean Americans: A Biographical Dictionary|first1=Serafín Mendez|last1=Mendez|first2=Gail|last2=Cueto|first3=Neysa Rodríguez|last3=Deynes|date=February 26, 2018|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313314438|via=Google Books}}</ref>

After working with such organizations as the lower Manhattan-based Community Action for Legal Services and the National Lawyers Guild, Rivera became a frequent attorney for the Puerto Rican activist group, the [[Young Lords]], eventually precipitating his entry into private practice.<ref name="google.com">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLPrMMKmynwC&q=geraldo+rivera+smith+fellow&pg=PA364|title=Notable Caribbeans and Caribbean Americans|work=google.com|isbn=9780313314438|accessdate=September 9, 2015|last1=Méndez-Méndez|first1=Serafin|last2=Mendez|first2=Serafín Mendez|last3=Cueto|first3=Gail|last4=Deynes|first4=Neysa Rodríguez|last5=Rodríguez-Deynes|first5=Neysa|year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Black against Empire|title-link=Black Against Empire |last1=Bloom |first1=Joshua |last2=Martin |first2=Waldo E., Jr.|publisher=[[University of California Press]] |page=295 |date=January 2013 |isbn= 978-0-520-27185-2 }}<!--|accessdate=June 26, 2013--></ref> This work attracted the attention of [[WABC-TV]] news director [[Al Primo]] when Rivera was interviewed about the group's occupation of an [[East Harlem]] church in 1969.

==Career==

===Early stages===
Rivera was hired by WABC-TV in 1970 as a reporter for ''[[Eyewitness News]]''. In 1972, he garnered national attention and won a [[Peabody Award]]<ref name="Powers185">{{cite book |last1=Powers |first1=Ron |authorlink1=Ron Powers |title=The Newscasters: The News Business as Show Business |url=https://archive.org/details/newscasters00ronp |url-access=registration |isbn=0312572085| year=1977 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/newscasters00ronp/page/185 185]}}</ref><ref>See also [[List of Peabody Award winners (1970–79)#1972]]</ref> for his report on the neglect and abuse of patients with [[intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]] at [[Staten Island]]'s [[Willowbrook State School]], and he began to appear on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] national programs such as ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'' and ''[[Nightline]]'' upon their launches in 1978 and 1979 respectively. After [[John Lennon]] watched Rivera's report on the patients at Willowbrook, he and Rivera put on a benefit concert called "One to One" on August 30, 1972, at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City (which [[Yoko Ono]] released posthumously in 1986, as ''[[Live in New York City (John Lennon album)|Live in New York City]]'').

[[File:Geraldo Rivera circa 1970s.JPG|thumb|180px|left|Rivera in the mid-1970s]]

In July 1973, Rivera taped the pilot episode of ''Good Night America,'' a late-night newsmagazine that he hosted (and executive produced).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://index.geraldo.com/folio/good-night-america|title=Geraldo Rivera: Good Night America|website=index.geraldo.com}}</ref>  It began its semi-regular airing from April 1974 to June 1977 as part of the ''[[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]]'' program block. The show featured the famous refrain from [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s hit "[[City of New Orleans (song)|City of New Orleans]]" (written by [[Steve Goodman]]) as the theme. ''Good Night America'' tackled controversial topics of the era, including marijuana usage and the status of [[Vietnam War]] [[Draft evasion|draft dodgers]]. A 1975 episode of the program, featuring [[Dick Gregory]] and [[Robert J. Groden]], showed the first national telecast of the historic [[Zapruder film]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/What-Does-the-Zapruder-Film-Really-Tell-Us-224928822.html?c=y&page=1 |title=What Does the Zapruder Film Really Tell Us? |author=Ron Rosenbaum |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |date=September 2013 |accessdate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref>  All 33 episodes of ''Good Night America'' may be viewed and downloaded [http://index.geraldo.com/folio/good-night-america here]

On May 19, 1983, Rivera broadcast the first U.S. [[Television network|network television]] mention of [[HIV/AIDS|"AIDS"]] by this name. (Other names had been used in the previous two years, as the disease was poorly understood at the time.)  He interviewed on ''20/20'' New York City lighting designer [[Ken Ramsauer]]. Ramsauer died aged 27, four days later;<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I31ODAAAQBAJ&q=Ramsauer |title=How to Survive a Plague: The Story of How Activists and Scientists Tamed AIDS |author=[[David France (writer)|David France]] |publisher=Pan Macmillan |date=December 1, 2016 |isbn=978-1-5098-3941-4 }}</ref> Rivera delivered a eulogy at Ramsauer's Central Park memorial service.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/14/nyregion/1500-attend-central-park-memorial-service-for-aids-victim.html |title=1,500 attend Central Park memorial service for AIDS victim |author=Lindsey Gruson |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 14, 1983 |accessdate=January 29, 2017 }}</ref>

In October 1985, ABC's [[Roone Arledge]] refused to air a report done by Sylvia Chase for ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'' on the relationship between [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[John F. Kennedy|John]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]].<ref>Rothenberg, Fred. "RIVERA QUITTING ABC, CITES NETWORK FRICTION." Wichita Eagle, The (KS), CITY EDITION ed., sec. LIFESTYLE, 23 Oct. 1985, p. 10C.

During a Fox News interview with [[Megyn Kelly]] aired May 15, 2015, Rivera stated the official reason given for the firing was that he violated ABC policy when he donated $200 to a non-partisan mayoral race candidate.{{vague|A single candidate is -- by definition -- partisan.|date=May 2015}}

On April 21, 1986, Rivera hosted ''[[The Mystery of Al Capone's Vaults]]''. The special broadcast was billed as the unearthing of Capone's secret vaults located under the old Lexington Hotel in Chicago. Millions of people watched the 2-hour show, but all that they uncovered was dirt. In a 2016 interview with the ''Chicago Tribune'', Rivera commented, "It was an amazingly high profile program — maybe the highest profile program I've ever been associated with." <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-al-capone-vault-geraldo-rivera-htmlstory.html |title=For its 30th anniversary, we watched ''Al Capone's Vaults'' with Geraldo Rivera so you didn't have to |author=Rumore, Kori |date=April 22, 2016 |accessdate=October 14, 2016 }}</ref>

===Talk shows, specials, and guest appearances===
In 1987, Rivera began producing and hosting the daytime talk show ''[[Geraldo (talk show)|Geraldo]]'', which ran for 11 years. The show featured controversial guests and theatricality, which led to the characterization of his show as "[[Tabloid talk show|Trash TV]]" by ''[[Newsweek]]'' and two [[United States Senate|United States senators]].<ref>{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = TWO DEMOCRATIC SENATORS JOIN BENNETT'S CRUSADE AGAINST 'TRASH TV' | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/20671503.html?dids=20671503:20671503&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT | format = newspaper | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | page = 26 | date = December 8, 1995 | accessdate = March 2, 2009 | quote = Two Democratic senators are joining Friday with William Bennett ... to criticize advertisers who support what critics call 'trash TV' talk shows ...

From 1994 to 2001, Rivera hosted ''Rivera Live'', a [[CNBC]] evening news and interview show which aired on weeknights.<ref>{{cite news |last=Beatty |first=Sally |date=November 2, 2001 |title=Geraldo Rivera to Leave CNBC For Fox and, Then, to Cover War |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1004655866590763080 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=New York, NY}}</ref>

In 2009, Rivera lent his voice to [[Phineas and Ferb]] in an episode entitled [[Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!]] playing newscaster Morty Williams.

===''Fox News'' to present===
[[File:GeraldoCHCI.jpg|thumb|right|Rivera after delivering the keynote at the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute]]'s 2008 Public Policy Conference]]

Rivera left CNBC in November 2001 — two months after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] — to become a [[Fox News]] war correspondent. Rivera's brother Craig accompanied him as a cameraman on assignments in Afghanistan.

In 2001, during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], Rivera was derided for a report in which he claimed to be at the scene of a [[friendly fire]] incident; it was later revealed he was actually 300 miles away. Rivera blamed a minor misunderstanding for the discrepancy.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1365910/Gun-toting-Geraldo-under-fire-for-the-story-that-never-was.html "Gun-toting Geraldo under fire for the story that never was"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', December 20, 2001</ref>

Controversy arose in early 2003, while Rivera was traveling with the [[101st Airborne Division]] in Iraq. During a Fox News broadcast, Rivera began to disclose an upcoming operation, even going so far as to draw a map in the sand for his audience. The military immediately issued a firm denunciation of his actions, saying it put the operation at risk; Rivera was expelled from Iraq.<ref name="cnn-irq">{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/31/sprj.irq.geraldo/ | title=Military kicks Geraldo out of Iraq | first=Chris | last=Plante | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=March 31, 2003 | accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5DD1039F932A35757C0A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=A NATION AT WAR: COVERAGE; Pentagon Says Geraldo Rivera Will Be Removed From Iraq | first=David | last=Carr | date=April 1, 2003 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> Two days later, he announced that he would be reporting on the [[Iraq War|Iraq conflict]] from [[Kuwait]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/features/20030406-2027-war-riveraapologizes.html |title=Geraldo Rivera apologizes for breaking reporting rules in Iraq |publisher=Legacy.utsandiego.com |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222040915/http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/features/20030406-2027-war-riveraapologizes.html |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2005, Rivera engaged in a feud with ''[[The New York Times]]'' over their allegations that he pushed aside a member of a rescue team in order to be filmed "assisting" a woman in a wheelchair down some steps in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In the ensuing controversy, Rivera appeared on television and demanded a retraction from the ''Times''. He further threatened to sue the paper if one was not provided.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2005/09/07/geraldo-rivera-might-sue-the-new-york-times/ |date=September 7, 2005|title=Geraldo Rivera might sue ''The New York Times''|journal= TV Squad| accessdate= December 17, 2011}}</ref> {{clarify|so what happened then?|date=April 2017}}

In 2007, Rivera was involved in a dispute with fellow Fox colleague [[Michelle Malkin]]. Malkin announced that she would not return to The ''O'Reilly Factor'', claiming that Fox News had mishandled a dispute over derogatory statements Rivera had made about her in a ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' interview. Rivera, while objecting to her views on immigration, said, "Michelle Malkin is the most vile, hateful commentator I've ever met in my life. She actually believes that neighbors should start snitching out neighbors, and we should be deporting people." He added, "It's good she's in D.C., and I'm in New York. I'd spit on her if I saw her." Rivera later apologized for his comments.<ref>Shanahan, Mark.
