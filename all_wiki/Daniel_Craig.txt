In 2005, Craig was contacted by [[Eon Productions]] to portray James Bond. Initially, he was unsure about the role when first offered it and was resistant to the producers' overtures.

====Opinions on Bond====
Craig has described his portrayal of Bond as an [[anti-hero]]: "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy who works for the good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing by the end of the film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is."<ref>{{cite news| author-link=Kevin Sessums| last=Sessums| first=Kevin |title=The Man Who Loves Being Bad| work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]| date=26 October 2008|url=http://www.parade.com/celebrity/2008/10/daniel-craig|access-date=27 October 2008}}</ref> Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is [[Sean Connery]], but says, "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me."
