==History and Organisation==
Organised by the [[British Fashion Council]] (BFC) for the [[London Development Agency]] with help from the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]], London Fashion Week first took place in October 1983.<ref name="Johnson, David"/> It currently ranks alongside New York, Paris and Milan as one of the 'Big Four' [[fashion week]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishfashioncouncil.com/content.aspx?CategoryID=420|title=British Fashion Council website|accessdate=10 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708094732/http://www.britishfashioncouncil.com/content.aspx?CategoryID=420|archive-date=8 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> It presents itself to funders<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/london_fashion_week_biannual_upd#comment-7716|title=Agreement for Funding Relative to Creative Sector Support – Designer Fashion.

It states that it is attended by over 5,000 press and buyers, and has estimated orders of over £100&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/uploads/documents/doc_1747.pdf|title=London Fashion Week factsheet|accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref> A retail-focused event, London Fashion Week Festival, takes place immediately afterwards at the same venue and is open to the general public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonfashionweekend.co.uk/|publisher=London Fashion Weekend|title=London Fashion Weekend website| accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref>

On-schedule events used to take place either at the [[British Fashion Council]]'s own show space, 180 Strand, or at external locations around [[central London]]. 

During SS16 (shown September 2015) and AW16 (shown February 2016), [[British Fashion Council]] made the decision to host the designers' showrooms to the 'Vinyl Factory', situated at the active car park in Soho, off Brewer Street. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/london-fashion-week-lessons-not-learned/ | title= Ikon London Magazine London Fashion Week coverage | publisher= Ikon London Magazine | date=22 February 2016 | accessdate= 3 March 2018}}</ref>

Following increasing numbers of anti-fur protesters, the London Fashion Week held in September 2018 was the first major fashion week to be fur-free.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/07/london-fashion-week-vows-to-be-fur-free|title=London fashion week vows to be fur-free |last=Conlon |first=Scarlett |date=2018-09-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref>
