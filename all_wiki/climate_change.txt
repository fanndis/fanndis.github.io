Although record-breaking years attract considerable media attention, individual years are less significant than the longer global temperature trend.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sévellec|Drijfhout|2018|p=}}.</ref> An example of a shorter episode is the slower rate of surface temperature increase from 1998 to 2012, which was labeled the "[[global warming hiatus]]".<ref>{{Harvnb|England|McGregor|Spence|Meehl|2014|p=}}; {{Harvnb|Knight|Kenney|Folland|Harris|2009|p=}}.</ref> Throughout this period, ocean heat storage continued to progress steadily upwards, and in subsequent years, surface temperatures have spiked upwards.

=== Regional variation ===

{{see also|Climate variability and change#Variability between regions}}
Global warming refers to global averages, with the amount of warming varying by region. Patterns of warming are independent of the locations of greenhouse gas emissions, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet; however, localized black carbon deposits on snow and ice do contribute to Arctic warming.<ref>{{harvnb|United States Environmental Protection Agency|2016|p=5|ps =: "Black carbon that is deposited on snow and ice darkens those surfaces and decreases their reflectivity (albedo). This is known as the snow/ice albedo effect. This effect results in the increased absorption of radiation that accelerates melting."}}</ref>

Since the pre-industrial period, global average land temperatures have increased almost twice as fast as global average surface temperatures.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SRCCL Summary for Policymakers|2019|p=7}}.</ref> This is because of the larger [[heat capacity]] of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by [[evaporation]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sutton|Dong|Gregory|2007}}.</ref> Over 90% of the additional energy in the climate system over the last 50 years has been stored in the ocean, warming it.<ref name="ocean heat absorption">

The Northern Hemisphere and North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more snow area and sea ice, because of how the land masses are arranged around the [[Arctic Ocean]]. As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start [[albedo|absorbing more heat]]. The Southern Hemisphere already had little [[sea ice]] in summer before it started warming.<ref>{{harvnb|NOAA, 10 July|2011}}.</ref> [[Arctic]] temperatures have increased and are predicted to continue to increase during this century at over [[polar amplification|twice the rate of the rest of the world]].<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1 Ch12|2013|p=1062}}; {{harvnb|Cohen|Screen|Furtado|Barlow|2014}}.</ref> Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened [[Gulf Stream]], causing increased warming in some areas.<ref>{{harvnb|NASA, 12 September|2018|p=}}.</ref>

{{Main|Attribution of recent climate change}}

By itself, the [[climate system]] experiences [[climate variability|various cycles]] which can last for years (such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation#On global warming|El Niño–Southern Oscillation]]) to decades or centuries.<ref>{{harvnb|Delworth|Zeng|2012|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Franzke|Barbosa|Blender|Fredriksen|2020}}.</ref> Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is "external" to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth.<ref>{{Harvnb|National Research Council|2012|p=9}}.</ref> Examples of [[Climate system#External climate forcing|external forcings]] include changes in the composition of the atmosphere (e.g. increased concentrations of [[greenhouse gas]]es), [[solar luminosity]], [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions, and [[orbital forcing|variations in the Earth's orbit]] around the Sun.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1 Ch10|2013|p=916}}.</ref>

Attribution of climate change is the effort to scientifically show which mechanisms are responsible for observed changes in Earth's climate. To determine anthropogenic attribution, known internal [[climate variability]] and natural external forcings need to be ruled out. Therefore, a key approach is to use computer modelling of the climate system to determine unique "fingerprints" for all potential causes. By comparing these fingerprints with observed patterns and evolution of climate change, and the observed history of the forcings, the causes of the observed changes can be determined.<ref>{{harvnb|Knutson|2017|p=443}}; {{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1 Ch10|2013|pp=875–876}}.</ref> For example, solar forcing can be ruled out as major cause because its fingerprint is warming in the entire atmosphere, and only the lower atmosphere has warmed, which is what is expected from greenhouse gases (which trap heat energy radiating from the surface).<ref name=":1" /> [[Attribution of recent climate change]] shows that the primary cause is greenhouse gases, and secondarily land-use changes, and aerosols and soot.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1 Summary for Policymakers|2013|pp=13–14}}.</ref>

The Earth absorbs [[sunlight]], then [[Radiative cooling|radiates it as heat]]. Some of this [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and because they re-emit it in all directions part of the heat is trapped on Earth instead of escaping into space.<ref>{{Cite web

From a consumption standpoint, the dominant sources of global 2010 emissions were: food and human waste (34%), thermal comfort, washing, and lighting (26%); [[Freight transport|freight]], travel, commuting, and communication (25%); and building construction (15%). These emissions take into account the [[Embodied energy|embodied fossil fuel energy]] in manufacturing materials including metals (e.g. steel, [[Aluminum smelting|aluminum]]), [[concrete]], glass, and [[plastic]], which are largely used in buildings, [[infrastructure]], and transportation.<ref>{{harvnb|Bajzelj|Allwood|Cullen|2013}}.</ref> From a [[Greenhouse gas emissions accounting#Measuring GHG emissions|production standpoint]], the primary sources of global greenhouse gas emissions are estimated as: electricity and heat (25%), agriculture and forestry (24%), industry and manufacturing (21%), transport (14%), and buildings (6%).<ref name=":2" />

Despite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant [[carbon sink]] for {{CO2}}. Natural processes, such as [[carbon fixation]] in the soil and photosynthesis, more than offset the greenhouse gas contributions from deforestation. The land-surface sink is estimated to remove about 11&nbsp;billion tonnes of {{CO2}} annually from the atmosphere, or about 29% of global {{CO2}} emissions.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SRCCL Summary for Policymakers|2019|p=10}}.</ref> The ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process. First, {{CO2}} dissolves in the surface water. Afterwards, the ocean's [[Thermohaline circulation|overturning circulation]] distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the [[carbon cycle]] ([[ocean acidification|changing the ocean's chemistry]]). Over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted {{CO2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SROCC Ch5|2019|p=450}}.</ref> The strength of both the land and ocean sinks increases as {{CO2}} levels in the atmosphere rise. In this respect they act as [[suppressing feedback]]s in global warming.<ref>{{harvnb|Friedlingstein|Jones|O'Sullivan|Andrew|2019|p=1803}}.</ref>

=== Land surface change ===
[[File:Operação Hymenaea, Julho-2016 (29399454651).jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation in Brazil]] in 2016]]
Humans change the Earth's surface mainly to create more [[agricultural land]]. Today, agriculture takes up 34% of Earth's land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.).<ref>{{harvnb|Ritchie|Roser|2018}}</ref> The amount of forested land continues to decrease, largely due to conversion to cropland in the tropics.<ref>{{harvnb|The Sustainability Consortium, 13 September|2018}}; {{harvnb|UN FAO|2016|p=18}}.</ref> This [[deforestation]] is the most significant aspect of land surface change affecting global warming. The main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce forestry/forest products (26%), short term [[shifting cultivation]] (24%), and wildfires (23%).<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Slay|Harris|Tyukavina|2018}}.</ref>

In addition to affecting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety of other chemical and physical mechanisms. Changing the type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature, by changing how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (''[[albedo]]''), and how much [[evaporative cooling|heat is lost by evaporation]]. For instance, the change from a dark [[forest]] to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of aerosols and other chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns (when the land surface presents different obstructions to wind).<ref name="Seymour 2019">{{harvnb|World Resources Institute, 8 December|2019}}.</ref> In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce a significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to an overall cooling effect.<ref name="Seymour 2019" /> Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.<ref name="IPCC Special Report: Climate change and Land p2-54">{{Harvnb|IPCC SRCCL Ch2|2019|pp=|ps=: "The global biophysical cooling alone has been estimated by a larger range of climate models and is −0.10 ± 0.14°C; it ranges from −0.57°C to +0.06°C&nbsp;... This cooling is essentially dominated by increases in surface albedo: historical land cover changes have generally led to a dominant brightening of land"|p=172}}.</ref>

=== Aerosols and clouds ===
[[File:ShipTracks MODIS 2005may11.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|[[Ship tracks]] can be seen as lines in these clouds over the Atlantic Ocean on the [[East Coast of the United States]] as [[Twomey effect|an effect of aerosols]].]] [[Air pollution]], in the form of [[aerosol]]s, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also [[Particulates#Climate effects|affects the climate]] on a large scale.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haywood|2016|p=456}}; {{harvnb|McNeill|2017}}; {{harvnb|Samset|Sand|Smith|Bauer|2018}}.</ref> From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of [[irradiance|sunlight reaching the Earth's surface]] was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as ''[[global dimming]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1 Ch2|2013|p=183}}.</ref> typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning.<ref>{{harvnb|He|Wang|Zhou|Wild|2018}}; {{Harvnb|Storelvmo|Phillips|Lohmann|Leirvik|2016}}.</ref> [[Wet deposition|Aerosol removal by precipitation]] gives tropospheric aerosols an [[atmospheric lifetime]] of only about a week, while [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] aerosols can remain in the atmosphere for a few years.<ref name="RamCarm2008">{{harvnb|Ramanathan|Carmichael|2008}}.</ref> Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning that they no longer mask global warming as much.<ref>{{harvnb|Wild|Gilgen|Roesch|Ohmura|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Storelvmo|Phillips|Lohmann|Leirvik|2016}}; {{harvnb|Samset|Sand|Smith|Bauer|2018}}.</ref>
 
In addition to their direct effects (scattering and absorbing solar radiation), aerosols have indirect effects on the [[Earth's energy budget|Earth's radiation budget]]. Sulfate aerosols act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets.<ref>{{harvnb|Twomey|1977}}.</ref> This effect also causes droplets to be more uniform in size, which reduces the [[Cloud physics#Collision-coalescence|growth of raindrops]] and makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight.<ref>{{harvnb|Albrecht|1989}}.</ref> Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.<ref>{{Harvnb|USGCRP Chapter 2|2017|p=78}}.</ref>

While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, [[black carbon]] in [[soot]] that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming. Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramanathan|Carmichael|2008}}; {{harvnb|RIVM|2016}}.</ref> Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by {{convert|0.2|C-change}} by 2050.<ref>{{harvnb|Sand|Berntsen|von Salzen|Flanner|2015}}.</ref>

== Responses ==
The two conventional responses are mitigation (preventing as much additional warming as possible by reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (adjusting society to compensate for unavoidable warming). Many of the countries that have contributed least to global greenhouse gas emissions are among the most vulnerable to climate change, which raises questions about justice and fairness with regard to mitigation and adaptation.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 SYR Summary for Policymakers|2014|loc=Section 3|p=17}}.</ref> A third option is [[climate engineering]], which refers to direct interventions in the Earth's climate system.<ref name="Gordijn 2012">{{harvnb|Gordijn|ten Have|2012}}</ref>

To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios.

==== Policies and measures ====
[[File:Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Economic Sector.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Economic sectors with more greenhouse gas contributions have a greater stake in climate change policies.]]
A wide range of [[Policy|policies]], [[regulation]]s and [[law]]s are being used to reduce greenhouse gases. Carbon pricing mechanisms include [[carbon tax]]es and [[Emissions trading|emissions trading systems]].<ref>{{harvnb|Union of Concerned Scientists, 8 January|2017}}; {{harvnb|Hagmann|Ho|Loewenstein|2019}}.</ref> As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>{{harvnb|World Bank, June|2019|p=12|loc=Box 1}}.</ref> [[Renewable portfolio standard]]s have been enacted in several countries requiring utilities to increase the percentage of electricity they generate from renewable sources.<ref>{{harvnb|National Conference of State Legislators, 17 April|2020}}; {{harvnb|European Parliament, February|2020}}.</ref> Phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, currently estimated at $300 billion globally (about twice the level of renewable energy subsidies),<ref>{{harvnb|REN21|2019|p=34}}.</ref> could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6%.<ref>{{harvnb|Global Subsidies Initiative|2019|p=iv}}</ref> Subsidies could also be redirected to support the [[Renewable energy transition|transition to clean energy]].<ref>{{harvnb|International Institute for Sustainable Development|2019|p=iv}}.</ref> More prescriptive methods that can reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry.<ref>{{harvnb|ICCT|2019|p=iv}}; {{harvnb| Natural Resources Defense Council, 29 September|2017}}.</ref>

Reducing [[air pollution]] from the burning of fossil fuels will have significant co-benefits in terms of human health.<ref>{{harvnb|Watts|Amann|Arnell|Ayeb-Karlsson|2019|pp=1856–1858}}; {{harvnb|WHO|2018|p=27}}</ref> For instance, the WHO estimates that ambient air pollution currently causes 4.2 million deaths per year due to stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases.{{Sfn|WHO|2018|p=16–17}} Meeting Paris Agreement goals could save about a million of those lives per year worldwide from reduced pollution by 2050.{{Sfn|WHO|2018|p=27}}<ref>{{harvnb|Nat Commun, 22 November|2018}}</ref>

As the use of fossil fuels is reduced, there are [[Just Transition]] considerations involving the social and economic challenges that arise. An example is the employment of workers in the affected industries, along with the well-being of the broader communities involved.<ref>{{harvnb|Carbon Brief, 4 Jan|2017}}.</ref> [[Climate justice]] considerations, such as those facing [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]] in the Arctic,<ref>{{harvnb|Pacific Environment, 3 October|2018}}; {{harvnb|Ristroph|2019}}.</ref> are another important aspect of mitigation policies.<ref>{{harvnb|UNCTAD|2009}}.</ref>

=== Adaptation ===
{{main|Climate change adaptation}}
Adaptation is "the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects". As climate change effects vary across regions, so do adaptation strategies.{{sfn|IPCC SR15 Ch4|2018|pp=396–397}} While some adaptation responses call for trade-offs, others bring synergies and co-benefits.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 SYR|2014}}, p. 112.</ref> Increased use of [[air conditioning]] allows people to better cope with heat, but also increases energy demand.{{Sfn|IPCC SR15 Ch5|2018|p=457}} Other examples of adaptation include improved coastline protection, better disaster management, and the development of more resistant crops.<ref>

The [[geopolitics]] of climate change is complex and has often been framed as a [[free-rider problem]], in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from investing in a transition to a low-carbon economy themselves. However, net [[import]]ers of fossil fuels win economically from transitioning, causing net exporters to face [[stranded assets]]: fossil fuels they cannot sell, if they choose not to transition.<ref>{{harvnb|Mercure|Pollitt|Viñuales|Edwards|2018}}.</ref> Furthermore, the benefits in terms of public health and local environmental improvements of [[coal phase out]] exceed the costs in almost all regions, potentially further eliminating the free-rider problem.<ref name="Rauner 2020">{{harvnb|Rauner|Bauer|Dirnaichner|Van Dingenen|2020}}.</ref> The geopolitics are further complicated by the [[supply chain]] of [[rare earth metals]]  necessary to produce many clean technologies.{{sfn|O'Sullivan|Overland|Sandalow|2017|pp=11–12}}

==== United Nations Framework Convention ====
{{Further|United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change}}
Nearly all countries in the world are parties to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC).<ref>{{harvnb|UNFCCC, "What is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change?"}}</ref> The objective of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.<ref>{{harvnb|UNFCCC|1992|loc=Article 2}}.</ref> As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where [[Climate change and ecosystems|ecosystems]] can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and [[Economics of climate change|economic development]] can be sustained.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG3 Ch1|2007}}, [http://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch1s1-es.html Executive summary].</ref> Global emissions have risen since signing of the UNFCCC, as it does not actually restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do.<ref name=":2">{{harvnb|EPA|2019}}.</ref> [[United Nations Climate Change conference|Its yearly conferences]] are the stage of global negotiations.<ref>{{harvnb|UNFCCC, "What are United Nations Climate Change Conferences?"}}.</ref>

The importance of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is underlined by the [[Sustainable Development Goal 13]] which is to "Take urgent [[Climate action|action to combat climate change]] and its impacts". It is one of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)]] to be achieved by 2030.<ref name=":32">Ritchie, Roser, Mispy, Ortiz-Ospina (2018) [https://sdg-tracker.org/climate-change "Measuring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals."

Other climate change treaties include the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]], which extended UNFCCC and in which most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions,<ref>{{harvnb|Kyoto Protocol|1997}}; {{harvnb|Liverman|2009|p=290}}.</ref> and the 2009 [[Copenhagen Accord]].<ref>{{harvnb|Müller|2010}}; {{harvnb|The New York Times, 25 May|2015}}; {{harvnb|UNFCCC: Copenhagen|2009}}.</ref> During Kyoto Protocol negotiations, the [[Group of 77|G77]] (representing [[Developing country|developing countries]]) pushed for a mandate requiring [[Developed country|developed countries]] to "[take] the lead" in reducing their emissions,<ref>{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Grubb|2003}}.</ref> since developed countries contributed most to the [[Greenhouse gas#Cumulative and historical emissions|accumulation]] of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and since [[Greenhouse gas#Annual emissions|per-capita emissions]] were still relatively low in developing countries.

While ozone depletion and global warming are considered separate problems, the solution to the former has significantly mitigated global warming.

[[File:Tyndalls setup for measuring radiant heat absorption by gases annotated.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Tyndall's sensitive [[Spectrophotometry|ratio spectrophotometer]] (drawing published in 1861) measured the extent to which infrared radiation was absorbed and emitted by various gases filling its central tube.]]

In 1824 [[Joseph Fourier]] proposed a version of the [[greenhouse effect]]; transparent atmosphere lets through visible light, which warms the surface. The warmed surface emits infrared radiation, but the atmosphere is relatively opaque to infrared and slows the emission of energy, warming the planet.<ref>{{harvnb|Archer|Pierrehumbert|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPY9HOfnuS0C&pg=PA10 10–14]}}.</ref> Starting in 1859,<ref>{{harvnb|Tyndall|1861}}.</ref> John Tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen (99% of dry air) are transparent to infrared, but water vapour and traces of some gases (significantly methane and carbon dioxide) both absorb infrared and, when warmed, emit infrared radiation. Changing concentrations of these gases could have caused "all the mutations of climate which the researches of geologists reveal" including [[ice age]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Archer|Pierrehumbert|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPY9HOfnuS0C&pg=PA39 39–42]}}; {{harvnb | Fleming | 2008|loc=[http://nsdl.library.cornell.edu/websites/wiki/index.php/PALE_ClassicArticles/GlobalWarming/Article3.html Tyndall]}}. In 1856 [[Eunice Newton Foote]] experimented using glass cylinders filled with different gases heated by sunlight, but her apparatus could not distinguish the infrared greenhouse effect. She found moist air warmed more than dry air, and {{co2}} warmed most, so she concluded higher levels of this in the past would have increased temperatures: {{harvnb|Huddleston|2019}}.</ref>

[[Svante Arrhenius]] noted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but carbon dioxide ({{co2}}) was determined by long term geological processes. At the end of an ice age, warming from increased {{co2}} would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying its effect in a feedback process. In 1896, he published the first climate model of its kind, showing that halving of {{co2}} could have produced the drop in temperature initiating the ice age. Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling {{co2}} to be around {{convert|5-6|C-change}}.{{snf|Lapenis|1998}} Other scientists were initially sceptical and believed the greenhouse effect to be saturated so that adding more {{co2}} would make no difference.

Early calculations treated the atmosphere as a single layer but in the 1950s, [[Gilbert Plass]] used digital computers to model the different layers and found added {{co2}} would cause warming. In the same decade [[Hans Suess]] found evidence {{co2}} levels had been rising, [[Roger Revelle]] showed the oceans would not absorb the increase, and together they helped [[Charles David Keeling|Charles Keeling]] to begin a record of continued increase, the [[Keeling Curve]].<ref name="Weart The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect" /> Scientists alerted the public,<ref>{{harvnb|Weart "Suspicions of a Human-Caused Greenhouse (1956–1969)"}}.</ref> and the dangers were highlighted at [[James Hansen]]'s 1988 Congressional testimony.<ref name="history.aip.org">{{harvnb|Weart "The Public and Climate Change: The Summer of 1988"}}, [http://history.aip.org/climate/public2.htm#L_0575 "News reporters gave only a little attention&nbsp;..."].</ref> The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary research]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weart|2013|p=3567}}.</ref>

== Terminology ==
Before the 1980s, when it was unclear whether warming by greenhouse gases would dominate aerosol-induced cooling, scientists often used the term ''inadvertent climate modification'' to refer to humankind's impact on the climate. In the 1980s, the terms ''global warming'' and ''climate change'' were introduced, the former referring only to increased surface warming, while the latter describes the full effect of greenhouse gases on the climate.<ref name="Conway 2008">{{harvnb|NASA, 5 December|2008}}.</ref> Global warming became the most popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S. Senate.<ref name="history.aip.org"/> In the 2000s, the term ''climate change'' increased in popularity.<ref>{{harvnb|Joo|Kim|Do|Lineman|2015}}.</ref> In lay usage, global warming usually refers to human-induced warming of the Earth system, whereas climate change can refer to natural as well as anthropogenic change.<ref>{{harvnb|NOAA, 17 June|2015}}: "when scientists or public leaders talk about global warming these days, they almost always mean human-caused warming"; {{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 SYR Glossary|2014|p=120}}: "Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use."</ref> The two terms are often used interchangeably.<ref>{{harvnb|NASA, 7 July|2020}}; {{Harvnb|Shaftel|2016|p=}}: "{{thinsp}}'Climate change' and 'global warming' are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings.&nbsp;... Global warming refers to the upward temperature trend across the entire Earth since the early 20th century&nbsp;... Climate change refers to a broad range of global phenomena&nbsp;...[which] include the increased temperature trends described by global warming."; {{harvnb|Associated Press, 22 September|2015}}: "The terms global warming and climate change can be used interchangeably. Climate change is more accurate scientifically to describe the various effects of greenhouse gases on the world because it includes extreme weather, storms and changes in rainfall patterns, ocean acidification and sea level.".</ref>
 
Various scientists, politicians and media figures have adopted the terms ''[[climate crisis]]'' or ''climate emergency'' to talk about climate change, while using ''global heating'' instead of global warming.<ref>{{harvnb|Hodder|Martin|2009}}; {{harvnb|BBC Science Focus Magazine, 3 February|2020}}.</ref> The policy editor-in-chief of ''[[The Guardian]]'' explained that they included this language in their editorial guidelines "to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue".<ref>{{harvnb|The Guardian, 17 May|2019}}; {{harvnb|BBC Science Focus Magazine, 3 February|2020}}.</ref> [[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford Dictionary]] chose ''climate emergency'' as its word of the year in 2019 and defines the term as "a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it".<ref>{{harvnb|USA Today, 21 November|2019}}.</ref>
