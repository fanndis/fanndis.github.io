Born in 1966 in [[Agia Paraskevi, Lesbos]], Vaxevanis began his journalistic career in ''[[Rizospastis]]'' in 1988. He later worked with other newspapers, including ''[[Eleftherotypia]]'', ''[[Kathimerini]]'', ''[[To Pontiki]]'' and ''[[To Vima]]''.

In 1991, he began doing stories on the television channels [[New Hellenic Television|NET]] and [[Mega Channel|MEGA]], being a reporter in war zones such as Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, Palestine, Albania and Kosovo.

==''Hot Doc''==
In April 2012, Vaxevanis began the publication of the fortnightly magazine ''[[Hot Doc]]''.

On 28 October 2012, he was arrested over the magazine's publication of a document claimed to be the [[Lagarde list]], a list of 1,991 names of Greek customers with accounts at the Swiss branch of [[HSBC]], suggesting that they could be tax evaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20116548|title=Greece arrests journalist over 'Lagarde List' banks leak|date=28 October 2012|accessdate=28 October 2012 |publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Greek magazine editor in court for naming alleged tax evaders |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/28/greek-editor-court-tax-evaders |publisher=The Guardian| accessdate=29 October 2012 |first=Julian |last=Borger |date=28 October 2012}}</ref> He was charged with "interfering with sensitive personal data".<ref name=NYT2910>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/world/europe/greece-moves-quickly-to-put-editor-on-trial.html?ref=global-home&_r=0 |title=Greece Moves Quickly to Put Editor on Trial |first=Rachel | last= Donadio |date=29 October 2012 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> The published list had names of customers of the Geneva branch of [[HSBC]] and, according to the magazine, "matched a list of 2,059 people" on the Lagarde list. Vaxevanis was released from Athens police headquarters a few hours after his arrest.<ref name=NYT2810>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/world/europe/greek-editor-arrested-after-publishing-list-of-swiss-bank-accounts.html?ref=world&_r=0  |title=Greek Editor Is Arrested After Publishing a List of Swiss Bank Accounts |author=Alderman, Liz |date=28 October 2012 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> On leaving the building, he told a reporter: "The prosecutor's office wants to protect tax evaders. I'm just doing my duty. Instead of arresting the tax evaders and the ministers who had the list in their hands, they're trying to arrest the truth and freedom of the press."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/on-the-trail-of-lost-taxes-in-greece/a-16340982 |title=On the Trail of Lost Taxes in Greece |date=29 October 2012 |publisher=Deutsche Welle |archivedate=31 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Boy6R0h6?url=http://www.dw.de/on-the-trail-of-lost-taxes-in-greece/a-16340982 |accessdate=30 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 29 October, he was given a "fast-track trial date" by prosecutors. Government critics contrasted the speed of the case against Vaxevanis with the slow arrest of [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] MP [[Ilias Kasidiaris]] and the government's slow investigation of the Lagarde list itself.<ref name=NYT2910 /> Following his arrest, Vaxevanis wrote an article for the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' describing his view of the circumstances behind the publication of the list.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vaxevanis|first=Kostas|title=Greece gave birth to democracy.

The retrial ended in November 2013 with another acquittal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Helena|title=Greek court acquits editor who leaked 'Lagarde list' of suspected tax evaders|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/27/greek-court-acquits-kostas-vaxevanis-leaked-lagarde-list-tax-evaders-privacy|accessdate=27 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 November 2013}}</ref>

In October 2019 he stated that the new Prime Minister [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] is trying to struggle economically the ''Documento''. He claims that the reason is his reportages about Mitsotakis' financing, his personal loans for ''Kyrix Chanion'' newspaper, his family's [[Offshore company|offshores]], such as his general politics.<ref>[https://www.koutipandoras.gr/article/kyriako-mitsotaki-esy-xereis-giati-fobasai-akomi-kai-den-xeroyme-emeis ''koutipandoras.gr'']</ref> [[David Sassoli]], president of the European Parliament, stated in a letter to the journalist that "there is worry about the situation of the Press in Greece and that they observe his case".<ref>[https://www.koutipandoras.gr/article/proedros-toy-eyrokoinoboylioy-gia-tin-kataggelia-baxebani-parakoloythoyme-stena-tin Πρόεδρος Ευρωκοινοβουλίου]</ref>

The media of Vaxevanis were excluded by the Greek government regarding the state financial aid to various Greek media for the promotion against the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] ("Petsas list").<ref>[https://www.efsyn.gr/politiki/kybernisi/247180_mehri-kai-se-anyparktes-istoselides-moirase-lefta-o-petsas Λίστα Πέτσα]</ref><ref>[https://www.avgi.gr/arheio/359968_i-kybernisi-dimosieyse-tin-polyanamenomeni-lista-petsa%3famp Η κυβέρνηση δημοσίευσε τη λίστα Πέτσα]</ref>
