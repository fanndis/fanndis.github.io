==History==
===1989–1991: Pre-launch as The Comedy Channel===
On November 15, 1989, [[Time-Life]], owners of [[HBO]], launched [[The Comedy Channel (United States)|The Comedy Channel]] as the first [[cable channel]] devoted exclusively to comedy-based programming. On April 1, 1990, [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]] (who owned [[MTV]], [[VH1]], and [[Nickelodeon]]) launched a rival channel called [[Ha! (TV channel)|Ha!]]<ref name="latimes">{{Cite news |last=Hall |first=Jane |date=November 15, 1989 |title=Cable Comedy—Will HBO Have the Last Laugh? : Television: The 24-hour Comedy Channel premieres tonight, but Viacom has plans to launch its own comedy channel, HA!, in the spring |work=Los Angeles Times |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-15/entertainment/ca-1886_1_comedy-channel |url-status=live |access-date=December 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222102117/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-15/entertainment/ca-1886_1_comedy-channel |archive-date=December 22, 2014}}</ref> that featured reruns of [[sitcom|situation comedies]] and some original [[sketch comedy]].

The Comedy Channel's programs were broadcast from the HBO Downtown Studios at 120 East 23rd Street in Manhattan. The format prior to the merger with Ha! included several original and unconventional programs such as ''Onion World'' with [[Rich Hall]] and ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', as well as laid-back variety/talk shows hosted by comedians, including ''The Sweet Life'' with [[Rachel Sweet]], ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]'', ''[[Sports Monster]]'', and ''[[The Higgins Boys and Gruber]]'', the latter of whom performed sketches in between showings of vintage television series like ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', and ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]''.

The standard format for The Comedy Channel's shows usually involved the various hosts introducing clips culled from the acts of stand-up comedians as well as classic comedies of the 1970s and 1980s, such as ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', presented in a style similar to music videos. In the early days, certain hours of the day when clips were shown without "host segments" were dubbed ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]''. In 1990, hosts under this title, [[Jon Stewart]] and [[Patty Rosborough]], were introduced. Comedian [[Marc Maron]] also hosted the series.

While The Comedy Channel broadcast mostly low-budget original programming,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Boone, Brian |date=January 12, 2012 |title=The Origin and Early Programs of Comedy Central |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/01/the-origin-and-early-programs-of-comedy-central |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315124954/http://splitsider.com/2012/01/the-origin-and-early-programs-of-comedy-central |archive-date=March 15, 2012 |access-date=March 29, 2012 |website=Splitsider}}</ref> Ha!'s schedule featured sitcom and sketch comedy reruns (many of which had been previously licensed for sister network [[Nick at Nite]]) as well as complete 90-minute reruns of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from the sixth through 16th seasons.

After two years of limited distribution, the two channels merged into one, relaunching on [[April Fools' Day|April 1]], 1991 as CTV: The Comedy Network; it later changed its name to Comedy Central on June 1, 1991<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vidani |first=Peter |title=The naming of Comedy Central. |url=http://fredalan.org/post/48928291883/the-naming-of-comedy-central |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125085338/http://fredalan.org/post/48928291883/the-naming-of-comedy-central |archive-date=January 25, 2016 |access-date=January 28, 2016}}</ref> to prevent issues with the [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] broadcast television network [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], which would eventually be its Canadian content partner through [[The Comedy Network]] when that channel started operations six years later.

===1991–2000===
[[File:Comedy Central logo (1990s).svg|150px|thumb|left|Comedy Central logo used from 1997 to 2000.]]
From the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, much of the [[broadcast programming|programming]] on Comedy Central and its predecessors consisted of [[comedy film]]s, sitcom reruns, half-hour specials, and clip shows featuring comedians. Except for the cult favorite ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', the channel had a relatively small viewership. A notable early success was ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' with [[Bill Maher]], which after showing promise on Comedy Central was quickly snapped up by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Additionally, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' had got its start with original host [[Craig Kilborn]], although it would take a few more years for the show to reach high popularity (and a shift toward a focus on political humor) with the introduction of [[Jon Stewart]] (who was former co-host of ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' from 1991). The channel was first launched as a joint venture between [[Time Warner]] and [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]], while [[Warner Home Video]] distributed the home media rights to the network's shows until 2003.

''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'' was also a notable original program from this era, as well as the game show ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]''. Successful non-original programming included Canadian comedy group ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' and British shows such as the UK edition of ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' (the predecessor of the U.S. version, featuring much of the same American cast as would later be seen in the U.S.) and the sitcom ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''. Some later seasons of ''AbFab'', as it was informally known, were partially financed by Comedy Central. Comedy Central also had the national rights to broadcast reruns of Seattle's ''[[Almost Live!]]'' between 1992 and 1993.

The channel made a breakthrough when ''[[South Park]]'' premiered in 1997. Being one of the first major basic cable shows to carry the [[TV Parental Guidelines|TV-MA]] rating for mature audiences, the show was considered too controversial to be picked up by any mainstream network;<ref name="nytsp">{{Cite news |last=Carter |first=Bill |date=November 10, 1997 |title=MEDIA: BROADCASTING; Comedy Central makes the most of an irreverent, and profitable, new cartoon hit |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/10/business/media-broadcasting-comedy-central-makes-most-irreverent-profitable-new-cartoon.html |url-status=live |access-date=December 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104130401/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/10/business/media-broadcasting-comedy-central-makes-most-irreverent-profitable-new-cartoon.html |archive-date=November 4, 2014}}</ref> the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] (known for ''[[The Simpsons]]'') for example refused to pick up the series due to the over-the-top offensive content at the time. As [[word of mouth]] spread, the number of people who requested that Comedy Central should be added to their cable providers increased, and the channel became available in over 50% of American homes by 1998. But, by 1999, with the cancellation of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', the channel was hemorrhaging viewers.

===2000–2010===
[[File:2000-2010Comedy Central logo.svg|thumb|150px|Comedy Central logo used from 2000 to 2010.]]
On November 13, 2000, Comedy Central introduced a modernized version of its globe logo, by straightening the buildings and removing the transmitter and marquee. The management of the network said that the transmitter of the 1992 and 1997 logos was said to "communicate the 1950s broadcast era". It also began to use a "seriously" styled-[[Baby Einstein]] graphics, and a new slogan "This is Comedy Central!". In 2002, [[Comedy Central Records]] was formed as a means of releasing albums by comedians that have appeared on the network.<ref name="presscentral">{{Cite web |title=Home |url=http://press.cc.com/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217144244/http://press.cc.com/ |archive-date=December 17, 2014 |access-date=December 3, 2014 |publisher=Press Central}}</ref>

By 2003, [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]] gained full ownership of Comedy Central, and since 2003, Comedy Central has created a [[Comedy Central Roast|tradition]] of roasting comedians in the style of the [[New York Friars' Club]] roasts. During these roasts, friends of the roastee, along with other comedians, take turns making fun of the roastee, the other roasters, and occasionally audience members. So far, the roastees have included [[Denis Leary]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Official site |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/leary_roast/index.jhtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123121809/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/leary_roast/index.jhtml |archive-date=November 23, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> [[Jeff Foxworthy]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comedy Central Roast of Jeff Foxworthy |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_foxworthy/index.jhtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102011758/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_foxworthy/index.jhtml |archive-date=November 2, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> [[Pamela Anderson]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_anderson/index.jhtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116122131/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_anderson/index.jhtml |archive-date=November 16, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> [[William Shatner]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Roast of Shatner |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_shatner/index.jhtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122143054/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_shatner/index.jhtml |archive-date=November 22, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> [[Flavor Flav]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav official site |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_flavor_flav/index.jhtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123123148/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_flavor_flav/index.jhtml |archive-date=November 23, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> [[Bob Saget]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Donald Trump]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[James Franco]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Bruce Willis]], and [[Alec Baldwin]].

The success of ''South Park'', despite its mature content, encouraged the network to continue to push the limits on adult language. Every Saturday and Sunday at 1&nbsp;am. ET, a movie, comedy special, or animated program is shown unedited for language as part of a block called the ''Secret Stash''. It premiered on July 4, 2003, with the unedited cable television debut of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. Though no language is censored on the Secret Stash, most nudity in the programs is still edited out, except for limited nudity allowed in animated programs such as ''[[Drawn Together]]'', and [[Buttocks|rear nudity]].

In late 2004, it was reported that the four highest-rated shows on Comedy Central were, in descending order, ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[Reno 911!]]''. Shortly thereafter, [[Dave Chappelle]] backed out of the much-anticipated third season of ''Chappelle's Show''.<ref>[https://www.today.com/popculture/comedy-central-air-chappelles-remainders-wbna10337064 Comedy Central to air Chappelle remainders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221133551/https://www.today.com/popculture/comedy-central-air-chappelles-remainders-wbna10337064 |date=February 21, 2020 }}, [[MSNBC]], December 12, 2005.</ref> Meanwhile, ''The Daily Show'' continued to climb in the ratings. In October 2005, on the occasion of a new three-year contract for ''South Park'' and the launch of ''Daily Show'' spin-off ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', it was reported that ''South Park'' and ''The Daily Show'' were the two highest-[[Nielsen ratings|rated]] shows on Comedy Central. Comedy Central chief [[Doug Herzog]] was reported as saying that he hoped to continue to air new seasons of ''South Park'' forever, and that ''The Colbert Report'' fulfilled a long-held plan to extend the ''Daily Show'' brand.

On April 5, 2006, in a controversial two-part episode arc titled "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]" and "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]", ''South Park'' touched the issue of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|recent protest]] over the Danish cartoon drawings depicting the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]]. The image of Muhammad did not appear in the episode. The episode also mocked fellow cartoon ''[[Family Guy]]''. On April 13, 2006, Comedy Central issued a statement<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 13, 2006 |title='South Park' Creators Skewer Own Network |url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/04/13/165631-south-park-creators-skewer-own-network |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112000549/http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/04/13/165631-south-park-creators-skewer-own-network |archive-date=January 12, 2012 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |publisher=Newsvine}}</ref> which appears to confirm that the network prohibited the show's creators from airing an image of Muhammad. The statement reads, ''"In light of recent world events, we feel we made the right decision."'' An anonymous source close to the show indicated{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} that ''South Park'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] were informed of the policy several weeks earlier and wrote this story arc in protest. This was a change of policy for Comedy Central, having allowed ''South Park'' to portray an image of Muhammad in an earlier episode, "[[Super Best Friends]]". Oddly enough, an image of Muhammad was still briefly visible in the opening credits of the "Cartoon Wars" episodes (the image had been there as a call-back to "Super Best Friends").

On January 15, 2007, MTV Networks International launched Comedy Central in Germany which is available for free throughout Europe. The channel airs 33 shows either dubbed in German or subtitled while also airing locally produced shows.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tzortzis |first=Andreas |date=February 18, 2007 |title=Comedy Central plays to a German sense of humor |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/18/business/comedy.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627050159/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/18/business/comedy.php |archive-date=June 27, 2007 |access-date=August 3, 2007 |website=International Herald Tribune}}</ref> On April 30, Dutch channel [[The Box Comedy|The Box]] was relaunched as the Dutch version of Comedy Central during the [[prime time|primetime]] and overnight hours timesharing with [[Nickelodeon (Netherlands)|Nickelodeon]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 23, 2007 |title=Dutch launch for Comedy Central |url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/today/?p=573 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205072153/http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/today/?p=573 |archive-date=February 5, 2008 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |publisher=Broadbandtvnews.com}}</ref> On May 1, 2007, Comedy Central expanded to Italy, replacing Paramount Comedy.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930174413/http://www.broadcastclub.co.uk/sateuropa_forum/upload/viewtopic.php?pid=318]</ref>

The network also played a role in the revival of the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'', which [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] had canceled in 2003. New episodes began airing on Comedy Central in 2010. But in May 2013, Comedy Central released a statement saying that the contract between Futurama and Comedy Central would not be renewed and that the summer of 2013 would be Futurama's final season on the air.

In 2009, Comedy Central introduced an Internet viral video reaction show hosted by comedian [[Daniel Tosh]] called [[Tosh.0]]. During its second year in the summer of 2010, it was the most viewed show, overtaking the Daily Show and The Colbert Report for male audiences aged 18–49. Many of the segments in Tosh.0's past seasons have received more views on Comedy Central's [[YouTube]] channel than any other show.

''[[South Park]]'' episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" aired in April 2010, revisiting the issue of the Islamic religious figure [[Muhammad]]'s perceived immunity to parody, for fear of violent retaliation. The Super Best Friends returned, but Muhammad was entirely covered by a black bar reading "CENSORED" through all of his screen time. By the second episode of the two-parter, Comedy Central decided to censor every instance of his name, as well as three entire monologues, from the end of the show. The monologues dealt with the subjects of censorship and intimidation but did not use Muhammad's name. Parker and Stone have since issued a statement to the press, confirming that the "bleeps" were added weeks after the show was finished and that Comedy Central has refused to let them post the original version of [[South Park Studios|South Park]], in addition to retroactively removing the original "Super Best Friends" episode. Parker threatened to quit the show after this incident.<ref>[[201 (South Park)#cite note-NYT Arts Blog-2]]</ref>

On November 5, 2007, an open letter<ref>{{Cite web |title=VideoSifts open letter to Comedy Central and Viacom |url=http://www.videosift.com/talk/An-Open-Letter-to-Comedy-Central-and-Viacom |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930161556/http://videosift.com/talk/An-Open-Letter-to-Comedy-Central-and-Viacom |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |publisher=Videosift.com}}</ref> was written by [[VideoSift]] to protest the blocking of Comedy Central's embedded video content for non-U.S.-based viewers.

On April 21, 2010, Comedy Central [[201 (South Park)#Censorship|censored]] the ''[[South Park]]'' episode, "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", in response to a [[death threat]] issued by users of a [[Revolution Muslim|radical Muslim website]] over the episode's planned depiction of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], which led several newspaper columnists to condemn the network's actions as tantamount to abetting terrorism. As a result, "201" and [[200 (South Park)|the episode that preceded it]] were heavily edited and not shown in repeats.
