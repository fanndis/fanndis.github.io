==Types and zygosity==
The vast majority of twins are either dizygotic (fraternal) or monozygotic (identical). Less common variants are discussed further down the article.

Fraternal twins can be any of the following:
* Female–female twins: Sometimes called sororal twins (25%).
* Male–male twins: Sometimes called fraternal twins (25%).
* Female-male twins: This is the most common pairing (50%), simply by virtue of it encompassing both "female-male" (25%) and "male-female" (25%) twins.

Among non-twin births, male singletons are slightly (about five percent) more common than female singletons. The rates for singletons vary slightly by country. For example, the sex ratio of birth in the US is 1.05 males/female,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html#People |title=United States: People |access-date=2008-10-02 |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date=2008-09-04}}</ref> while it is 1.07 males/female in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/it.html#People |title=Italy: People |access-date=2008-10-02 |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date=2008-09-04}}</ref> However, males are also more susceptible than females to die ''in utero'', and since the death rate ''in utero'' is higher for twins, it leads to female twins being more common than male twins.<ref name="WSTR">{{cite web|url=https://wstwinregistry.org/2015/10/01/are-there-more-male-twins-or-female-twins/|title=Are there more male twins or female twins?|publisher=Washington State Twin Registry|access-date=24 July 2018}}</ref>

[[Zygosity]] is the degree of identity in the [[genome]] of twins.

=== {{anchor|Fraternal|Fraternal twins|Dizygotic|Fraternal (dizygotic) twins}}Dizygotic (fraternal) twins===
[[File:Red-haired Siblings.jpg|thumb|right|Adult fraternal twins]]

'''Dizygotic''' ('''DZ''') or '''fraternal''' '''twins''' (also referred to as "non-identical twins", "dissimilar twins", "biovular twins", and, informally in the case of females, "sororal twins") usually occur when two [[fertilization|fertilized]] eggs are implanted in the uterus wall at the same time. When two eggs are independently fertilized by two different [[sperm]] cells, fraternal twins result. The two eggs, or ''ova'', form two [[zygote]]s, hence the terms ''dizygotic'' and ''biovular''. Fraternal twins are, essentially, two ordinary [[siblings]] who happen to be born at the same time, since they arise from two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm, just like ordinary siblings.

This is the most common type of twin.<ref name=multi>{{cite web|url=http://multiples.about.com/cs/funfacts/a/twinzygosity.htm |title=Identical and Fraternal Twins – Determining Zygosity in Twins |publisher=Multiples.about.com |date=2013-07-16 |access-date=2013-09-16}}</ref>

Dizygotic twins, like any other siblings, will practically always have different sequences on each chromosome, due to [[chromosomal crossover]] during [[meiosis]]. Dizygotic twins share only 50 percent of each other's genes, which resemble amongst siblings that are conceived and born at different times. Like any other [[sibling]]s, dizygotic twins may look similar, particularly given that they are the same age. However, dizygotic twins may also look very different from each other (for example, be of opposite sexes).

Studies show that there is a genetic proclivity for dizygotic twinning. However, it is only the mother who has any effect on the chances of having such twins; there is no known mechanism for a father to cause the release of more than one [[ovum]]. Dizygotic twinning ranges from six per thousand births in Japan (similar to the rate of monozygotic twins) to 14 and more per thousand in some African countries.<ref>{{Cite book

[[File:Identical-fraternal-sperm-egg.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of zygote development in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. In the uterus, a majority of monozygotic twins (60–70%) share the same [[placenta]] but have separate [[amniotic sac]]s. In 18–30% of monozygotic twins each fetus has a separate placenta and a separate amniotic sac. A small number (1–2%) of monozygotic twins share the same placenta and amniotic sac.

'''Monozygotic''' ('''MZ''') or '''identical''' '''twins''' occur when a single [[ovum|egg]] is fertilized to form one [[zygote]] (hence, "monozygotic") which then divides into two separate [[embryo]]s.

====Mechanism====
Regarding spontaneous or ''natural'' monozygotic twinning, a recent theory proposes that monozygotic twins are probably formed when a [[blastocyst]] contains two inner cell masses (ICM), each of which will lead to a separate fetus, rather than by the embryo splitting while hatching from the [[zona pellucida]] (the gelatinous protective coating around the blastocyst).<ref>{{Cite news|title=Study: Time-lapse recordings reveal why IVF embryos are more likely to develop into twins |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-07/esfh-trr070107.php |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |date=2007-07-02 |access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>

Monozygotic twins may also be created artificially by embryo splitting. It can be used as an expansion of [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to increase the number of available embryos for [[embryo transfer]].<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 93|issue= 2|pages= 423–7|date=February 2009 |pmid=19217091 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.098 }}</ref>

====Incidence====
Monozygotic twinning occurs in birthing at a rate of about 3 in every 1000 deliveries worldwide (about 0.3% of the world population).<ref name=wonderquest>{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderquest.com/TwinsTrigger.htm |title=What triggers twinning? |author=April Holladay |date=2001-05-09 |publisher=WonderQuest |access-date=2007-03-22}}</ref>

The likelihood of a single fertilization resulting in monozygotic twins is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world.<ref name="Bortolus" /> This is in marked contrast to dizygotic twinning, which ranges from about six per thousand births in Japan (almost similar to the rate of identical twins, which is around 4–5) to 15 and more per thousand in some parts of India<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jaroslaw J. |last=Oleszczuk |author2=Donald M. Keith |author3=Louis G. Keith |author4=William F. Rayburn |title=Projections of population-based twinning rates through the year 2100 |journal=The Journal of Reproductive Medicine |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=913–921 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10589400 |url=http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=13594 |access-date=2008-10-02}}</ref> and up to over 20 in some Central African countries.<ref name="Smits"/> The exact cause for the splitting of a zygote or embryo is unknown.

IVF techniques are more likely to create dizygotic twins. For IVF deliveries, there are nearly 21 pairs of twins for every 1,000.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Time-lapse recordings reveal why IVF embryos are more likely to develop into twins. Researchers believe the laboratory culture could be the cause |publisher=[[European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology]] |date=2007-07-02 |url=http://www.eshre.com/emc.asp?pageId=939 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921094734/http://www.eshre.com/emc.asp?pageId=939 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-21 |access-date=2008-09-30 }}</ref>

====Genetic and epigenetic similarity====
Monozygotic twins are genetically nearly identical and they are always the same sex unless there has been a mutation during development. The children of monozygotic twins test genetically as half-siblings (or full siblings, if a pair of monozygotic twins reproduces with another pair or with the same person), rather than first cousins. Identical twins do not have the same [[fingerprint]]s however, because even within the confines of the womb, the fetuses touch different parts of their environment, giving rise to small variations in their corresponding prints and thus making them unique.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Patwari|first=P|author2=Lee, RT |title=Mechanical control of tissue morphogenesis.|journal=Circulation Research|date=2008-08-01|volume=103|issue=3|pages=234–43|pmid=18669930|doi=10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.175331|pmc=2586810}}</ref>

Monozygotic twins always have the same [[genotype]]. Normally due to an environmental factor or the deactivation of different X chromosomes in female monozygotic twins, and in some extremely rare cases, due to [[aneuploidy]], twins may express different sexual [[phenotypes]], normally from an XXY [[Klinefelter syndrome]] zygote splitting unevenly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Edwards |first=JH |author2=T Dent |author3=J Kahn |title=Monozygotic twins of different sex |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=117–123 |date=June 1966 |pmid=6007033 |pmc=1012913 |doi= 10.1136/jmg.3.2.117}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Machin |first=GA |title=Some causes of genotypic and phenotypic discordance in monozygotic twin pairs |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=216–228 |date=January 1996 |pmid=8741866 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19960122)61:3<216::AID-AJMG5>3.0.CO;2-S }}</ref><ref name="Schmid2000">{{cite journal|pmid=11113914 | volume=20 | issue=12 | title=Prenatal diagnosis of heterokaryotypic mosaic twins discordant for fetal sex. | date=Dec 2000 | journal=Prenat Diagn | pages=999–1003 | doi=10.1002/1097-0223(200012)20:12<999::aid-pd948>3.0.co;2-e | last1 = Schmid | first1 = O | last2 = Trautmann | first2 = U | last3 = Ashour | first3 = H | last4 = Ulmer | first4 = R | last5 = Pfeiffer | first5 = RA | last6 = Beinder | first6 = E}}</ref>

Monozygotic twins, although genetically very similar, are not genetically exactly the same. The DNA in white blood cells of 66 pairs of monozygotic twins was analyzed for 506,786 [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s known to occur in human populations. Polymorphisms appeared in 2 of the 33 million comparisons, leading the researchers to extrapolate that the blood cells of monozygotic twins may have on the order of one DNA-sequence difference for every 12&nbsp;million nucleotides, which would imply hundreds of differences across the entire genome.<ref name="pmid24123875">{{cite journal | vauthors = Li R, Montpetit A, Rousseau M, Wu SY, Greenwood CM, Spector TD, Pollak M, Polychronakos C, Richards JB | title = Somatic point mutations occurring early in development: a monozygotic twin study | journal = J.

If they occur early in fetal development, they will be present in a very large proportion of body cells.

Another cause of difference between monozygotic twins is [[Epigenetics|epigenetic modification]], caused by differing environmental influences throughout their lives. Epigenetics refers to the level of activity of any particular gene. A gene may become switched on, switched off, or could become partially switched on or off in an individual. This epigenetic modification is triggered by environmental events. Monozygotic twins can have markedly different epigenetic profiles. A study of 80 pairs of monozygotic twins ranging in age from three to 74 showed that the youngest twins have relatively few [[epigenetic]] differences. The number of epigenetic differences increases with age. Fifty-year-old twins had over three times the epigenetic difference of three-year-old twins. Twins who had spent their lives apart (such as those adopted by two different sets of parents at birth) had the greatest difference.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Fraga |first1=Mario F. |last2=Ballestar |first2=Esteban |last3=Paz |first3=Maria F. |last4=Ropero |first4=Santiago |last5=Setien |first5=Fernando |last6=Ballestar |first6=Maria L. |last7=Heine-Suñer |first7=Damia  |last8=Cigudosa |first8=Juan C. |last9=Urioste |first9=Miguel |last10=Benitez |first10=Javier |last11=Boix-Chornet |first11=Manuel |last12=Sanchez-Aguilera |first12=Abel |last13=Ling |first13=Charlotte |last14=Carlsson |first14=Emma |last15=Poulsen |first15=Pernille |last16=Vaag |first16=Allan |last17=Stephan |first17=Zarko |last18=Spector |first18=Tim D. |last19=Wu |first19=Yue-Zhong |last20=Plass |first20=Christoph |last21=Esteller |first21=Manel |display-authors=5 |title=Epigenetic differences arise during the lifetime of monozygotic twins |journal=Proc.

==Degree of separation==
{{anchor|Chorionicity}}
[[File:Placentation.svg|thumb|Various types of chorionicity and amniosity (how the baby's sac looks) in monozygotic (one egg/identical) twins as a result of when the fertilized egg divides]]

The degree of separation of the twins in utero depends on if and when they split into two zygotes.  Dizygotic twins were always two zygotes.  Monozygotic twins split into two zygotes at some time very early in the pregnancy.  The timing of this separation determines the chorionicity (the number of placentae) and amniocity (the number of sacs) of the pregnancy.  Dichorionic twins either never divided (i.e.: were dizygotic) or they divided within the first 4 days. Monoamnionic twins divide after the first week.

In very rare cases, twins become [[conjoined twins]]. Non-conjoined monozygotic twins form up to day 14 of embryonic development, but when twinning occurs after 14 days, the twins will likely be conjoined.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hall JG | title=Twinning | journal=[[The Lancet]] | volume=362 | issue=9385 | year=2003 | pages=735–43 | url=http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/7/8/D/%7B78DF6E68-11E3-47D4-A34F-9A086F1E9B1C%7Dhall2003.pdf | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(03)14237-7 | pmid=12957099 | access-date=2016-05-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603021434/http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/7/8/D/%7B78DF6E68-11E3-47D4-A34F-9A086F1E9B1C%7Dhall2003.pdf | archive-date=2016-06-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Furthermore, there can be various degrees of shared environment of twins in the womb, potentially leading to [[pregnancy complication]]s.

It is a common misconception that two [[placenta]]s means twins are dizygotic.  But if monozygotic twins separate early enough, the arrangement of sacs and placentas in utero is indistinguishable from dizygotic twins.

Monoamniotic twins, as with diamniotic monochorionic twins, have a risk of [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]]. Also, the two umbilical cords have an increased chance of being tangled around the babies. Because of this, there is an increased chance that the newborns may be miscarried or suffer from [[cerebral palsy]] due to lack of oxygen.

| [[Conjoined twins]]
|
When the division of the developing [[zygote]] into 2 embryos occurs, 99% of the time it is within 8 days of fertilization.

Mortality is highest for conjoined twins due to the many complications resulting from shared organs.
| If the division of the zygote occurs later than the 12 days then [[conjoined twins]] are usually the result.

==Demographics==
A 2006 study has found that [[insulin-like growth factor]] present in dairy products may increase the chance of dizygotic twinning. Specifically, the study found that [[Veganism|vegan]] mothers (who exclude dairy from their diets) are one-fifth as likely to have twins as vegetarian or omnivore mothers, and concluded that "Genotypes favoring elevated IGF and diets including dairy products, especially in areas where [[growth hormone]] is given to cattle, appear to enhance the chances of multiple pregnancies due to ovarian stimulation."<ref name="vegan">{{Cite journal|last=Steinman |first=Gary |title=Mechanisms of twinning: VII.

The widespread use of fertility drugs causing hyperovulation (stimulated release of multiple eggs by the mother) has caused what some call an "epidemic of [[multiple birth]]s". In 2001, for the first time ever in the [[United States|US]], the twinning rate exceeded 3% of all births. Nevertheless, the rate of ''monozygotic'' twins remains at about 1 in 333 across the globe.

In a study on the maternity records of 5750 [[Hausa people|Hausa]] women living in the Savannah zone of [[Nigeria]], there were 40 twins and 2 triplets per 1000 births. Twenty-six percent of twins were monozygotic. The incidence of multiple births, which was about five times higher than that observed in any western population, was significantly lower than that of other ethnic groups, who live in the hot and humid climate of the southern part of the country. The incidence of multiple births was related to maternal age but did not bear any association to the climate or prevalence of [[malaria]].<ref name="hausa">{{Cite journal|last=Rehan |first=N |author2=DS Tafida  |title=Multiple births in Hausa women |journal=Br J Obstet Gynaecol |volume=87 |issue=11 |pages=997–1004 |date=November 1980 |pmid=7437372 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1980.tb04464.x }}</ref><ref>[http://www.randafricanart.com/Yoruba_Customs_and_Beliefs_Pertaining_to_Twins.html Yoruba Customs and Beliefs Pertaining to Twins].

Twins are more common in African Americans.<ref>https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=85&contentid=P08019</ref>

===Predisposing factors===
The predisposing factors of monozygotic twinning are unknown.

Dizygotic twin pregnancies are slightly more likely when the following factors are present in the woman:
*She is of [[West Africa]]n descent (especially [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]])
*She is between the age of 30 and 40 years
*She is greater than average height and weight
*She has had several previous pregnancies.

Women undergoing certain fertility treatments may have a greater chance of dizygotic multiple births. In the United States it has been estimated that by 2011 36% of twin births resulted from conception by [[assisted reproductive technology]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kulkarni | first1 = A.

The risk of twin birth can vary depending on what types of fertility treatments are used. With [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF), this is primarily due to the insertion of multiple embryos into the uterus. [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|Ovarian hyperstimulation]] without IVF has a very high risk of multiple birth. Reversal of [[anovulation]] with [[clomifene]] (trade names including ''Clomid'') has a relatively less but yet significant risk of multiple pregnancy.

The excluded twin pregnancies were in cases of (1) delivery before 34 weeks of gestation; (2) when the first twin was delivered by [[caesarean section]]; (3) when either of the twins had died in the womb before the onset of labor; and (4) when the pregnancy had been complicated by fetal malformations or [[Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]].</ref> The delivery interval between the twins was measured as follows:

:*Within 15 minutes: 75.8%
:*16–30 minutes: 16.4%
:*31–45 minutes: 4.3%
:*46–60 minutes: 1.7%
:*Over 60 minutes: 1.8% (72 instances)

The study stated that the occurrence of complications "was found to be more likely with increasing twin-to-twin delivery time interval" and suggested that the interval be kept short, though it noted that the study did not examine causes of complications and did not control for factors such as the level of experience of the obstetrician, the wish of the women giving birth, or the "management strategies" of the procedure of delivering the second twin.

There have also been cases in which twins are born a number of days apart. Possibly the worldwide record for the duration of the time gap between the first and the second delivery was the birth of twins 97 days apart in Cologne, Germany, the first of which was born on November 17, 2018.<ref>https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/i-ll-do-it-my-way-twin-is-born-three-months-after-her-sister-f3jkjp72q</ref>

==Complications during pregnancy==

===Vanishing twins===
{{Main|Vanishing twin}}

Researchers suspect that as many as 1 in 8 pregnancies start out as multiples, but only a single fetus is brought to full term, because the other fetus has died very early in the pregnancy and has not been detected or recorded.<ref name="Keith-2">{{Cite book

}}</ref> Early [[obstetric ultrasonography]] exams sometimes reveal an "extra" fetus, which fails to develop and instead disintegrates and vanishes in the uterus. There are several reasons for the "vanishing" fetus, including it being embodied or absorbed by the other fetus, placenta or the mother. This is known as [[vanishing twin]] syndrome. Also, in an unknown proportion of cases, two zygotes may fuse soon after fertilization, resulting in a single [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] embryo, and, later, fetus.

[[File:Chang-eng-bunker-PD.png|thumb|upright|[[Chang and Eng Bunker]], born in Siam (now [[Thailand]]) in 1811, were the origin of the term "Siamese twins".]]

===Conjoined twins===
{{Main|Conjoined twins}}

Conjoined twins (or the once-commonly used term "siamese") are monozygotic twins whose bodies are joined together during pregnancy. This occurs when the zygote starts to split after day 12<ref name="Shulman"/> following fertilization and fails to separate completely. This condition occurs in about 1 in 50,000 human pregnancies.
Most conjoined twins are now evaluated for surgery to attempt to separate them into separate functional bodies. The degree of difficulty rises if a vital organ or structure is shared between twins, such as the [[brain]], [[heart]] or [[liver]].

===Chimerism===
{{Main|Chimera (genetics)}}
A chimera is an ordinary person or animal except that some of their parts actually came from their twin or from the mother. A chimera may arise either from monozygotic twin fetuses (where it would be impossible to detect), or from dizygotic fetuses, which can be identified by chromosomal comparisons from various parts of the body. The number of cells derived from each fetus can vary from one part of the body to another, and often leads to characteristic [[mosaicism]] skin coloration in human chimeras. A chimera may be [[intersex]], composed of cells from a male twin and a female twin. In one case [[DNA test]]s determined that a woman, mystifyingly, was not the mother of two of her three children; she was found to be a chimera, and the two children were conceived from eggs derived from cells of their mother's twin.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18024215.100-the-stranger-within.html?full=true |work = New scientist|title = The stranger within|date = 15 November 2003|last = Ainsworth|first = Chris|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

===Parasitic twins===
{{Main|Parasitic twin}}

Sometimes one twin fetus will fail to develop completely and continue to cause problems for its surviving twin. One fetus acts as a [[parasite]] towards the other.
Sometimes the parasitic twin becomes an almost indistinguishable part of the other, and sometimes this needs to be treated medically.

===Partial molar twins===
A very rare type of parasitic twinning is one where a single viable twin is endangered when the other zygote becomes cancerous, or "molar". This means that the molar zygote's cellular division continues unchecked, resulting in a cancerous growth that overtakes the viable fetus. Typically, this results when one twin has either [[triploidy]] or complete paternal [[uniparental disomy]], resulting in little or no fetus and a cancerous, overgrown placenta, resembling a bunch of grapes.

===Miscarried twin===
Occasionally, a woman will suffer a [[miscarriage]] early in pregnancy, yet the pregnancy will continue; one twin was miscarried but the other was able to be carried to term. This occurrence is similar to the [[vanishing twin]] syndrome, but typically occurs later, as the twin is not reabsorbed.

===Low birth weight===
It is very common for twins to be born at a low [[birth weight]]. More than half of twins are born weighing less than {{convert|5.5|lb}}, while the average birth weight of a healthy baby should be around {{convert|6|-|8|lb|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|title = Risks Linked With Twin Births|url = http://www.webmd.com/baby/risks-linked-with-twin-births|website = WebMD|access-date = 2015-10-23}}</ref> This is largely due to the fact that twins are typically born [[Premature labour|premature]]. Premature birth and low birth weights, especially when under {{convert|3.5|lb}}, can increase the risk of several health-related issues, such as vision and hearing loss, mental disabilities, and [[cerebral palsy]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Very Low Birthweight - Online Medical Encyclopedia - University of Rochester Medical Center|url = https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=90&ContentID=P02424|website = www.urmc.rochester.edu|access-date = 2015-10-23}}</ref> There is an increased possibility of potential complications as the birth weight of the baby decreases.

===Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome===
{{Main|Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome}}
Monozygotic twins who share a placenta can develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This condition means that blood from one twin is being diverted into the other twin. One twin, the 'donor' twin, is small and [[anemic]], the other, the 'recipient' twin, is large and [[polycythemic]]. The lives of both twins are endangered by this condition.

=== Stillbirths ===
[[Stillbirth]]s occurs when a fetus dies after 20 weeks of gestation. There are two types of stillbirth, including intrauterine death and intrapartum death. Intrauterine death occurs when a baby dies during late pregnancy. Intrapartum death, which is more common, occurs when a baby dies while the mother is giving birth. The cause of stillbirth is often unknown, but the rate of babies who are stillborn is higher in twins and multiple births. Caesareans or inductions are advised after 38 weeks of pregnancy for twins, because the risk of stillbirth increases after this time.<ref>{{cite web|title = Pregnant with twins: potential complications|url = http://www.babycentre.co.uk/a3584/pregnant-with-twins-potential-complications|website = BabyCentre|access-date = 2015-10-26}}</ref>

=== [[Heterotopic pregnancy]] ===
[[Heterotopic pregnancy]] is an exceedingly rare type of dizygotic twinning in which one twin implants in the uterus as normal and the other remains in the fallopian tube as an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. Ectopic pregnancies must be resolved because they can be life-threatening to the mother. However, in most cases, the intrauterine pregnancy can be salvaged.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Human twin studies==
{{Main|Twin study}}

Twin studies are utilized in an attempt to determine how much of a particular trait is attributable to either genetics or environmental influence. These studies compare monozygotic and dizygotic twins for [[medical]], [[genetics|genetic]], or [[psychology|psychological]] characteristics to try to isolate genetic influence from epigenetic and [[natural environment|environment]]al influence. Twins that have been separated early in life and raised in separate households are especially sought-after for these studies, which have been used widely in the exploration of [[human nature]].  Classical twin studies are now being supplemented with molecular genetic studies which identify individual genes.

==Unusual twinnings==
===Bi-paternal twins===
This phenomenon is known as heteropaternal superfecundation. One 1992 study estimates that the frequency of heteropaternal superfecundation among dizygotic twins, whose parents were involved in paternity suits, was approximately 2.4%; see the references section, below, for more details. {{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Dizygotic twins from [[biracial]] couples can sometimes be [[mixed twins]], which exhibit differing ethnic and racial features. One such pairing was born in [[London]] in 1993 to a white mother and Caribbean father.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Black and white twins|first=Joanna |last=Moorhead |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-09-24 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/24/twins-black-white?INTCMP=SRCH |access-date=2012-04-07}}</ref>

===Monozygotic twins of different sexes===
Among monozygotic twins, in extremely rare cases, twins have been born with different sexes (one male, one female).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=R |last=Schmidt |author2=EH Sobel |author3=HM Nitowsky |author4=H Dar |author5=FH Allen Jr |title=Monozygotic twins discordant for sex |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=64–68 |date=February 1976 |pmid=944787 |pmc=1013354 |doi= 10.1136/jmg.13.1.64|url=http://jmg.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/1/64 |access-date=2008-09-29}}</ref> When monozygotic twins are born with different sexes it is because of chromosomal defects.  The probability of this is so small that multiples having different sexes is universally accepted as a sound basis for ''in utero'' clinical determination that the multiples are not monozygotic.

Another abnormality that can result in monozygotic twins of different sexes is if the egg is fertilized by a male sperm but during cell division only the X chromosome is duplicated. This results in one normal male (XY) and one female with [[Turner syndrome]] (45,X).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twinsmagazine.com/images/zygosityMA03.pdf |title=The Zygosity Puzzle |access-date=2015-04-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081204/http://www.twinsmagazine.com/images/zygosityMA03.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>  In these cases, although the twins did form from the same fertilized egg, it is incorrect to refer to them as genetically identical, since they have different [[karyotype]]s.

==={{anchor|Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|Half-identical twins}}Semi-identical twins===
[[Monozygotic]] twins can develop differently, due to their genes being differently activated.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Scott F. |last=Gilbert |title=Developmental biology |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-87893-250-4 |chapter=Non-identical Monozygotic Twins |chapter-url=http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?id=111 |access-date=2008-09-30 |oclc=172964621 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106171619/http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?id=111 |archive-date=2009-01-06 }}</ref> More unusual are "semi-identical twins", also known as "sesquizygotic". {{As of|2019}}, only two cases have been reported.<ref name="NEJM" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Rare new kind of twins: boy and girl are semi-identical |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/semi-identical-twins-1.5036783 |website=CBC News |publisher=Thomson Reuters |access-date=28 February 2019 |date=28 February 2019}}</ref> These "half-identical twins" are hypothesized to occur when an unfertilized egg cleaves into two identical attached ova, both of which are viable for fertilization. Both ova are then fertilized, each by a different sperm, and the coalesced zygotes undergo further cell duplications developing as a chimeric [[blastomere]]. If this blastomere then undergoes a twinning event, two embryos will be formed, with different paternal genetic information and identical maternal genetic information.

This results in a set of twins with identical gene sequence from the mother's side, but different sequences from the father's side. Cells in each fetus carry chromosomes from either sperm, resulting in [[chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s. This form had been speculated until only recently being recorded in Western medicine. <ref name="pmid17165045">{{cite journal | vauthors = Souter VL, Parisi MA, Nyholt DR, Kapur RP, Henders AK, Opheim KE, Gunther DF, Mitchell ME, Glass IA, Montgomery GW | title = A case of true hermaphroditism reveals an unusual mechanism of twinning | journal = Hum.

In 2007, a study reported a case of a pair of living twins, which shared an identical set of maternal chromosomes, while each having a distinct set of paternal chromosomes, albeit from the same man, and thus they most likely share half of their father's genetic makeup. The twins were both found to be [[chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s. One was an [[intersex]] XX, and one a [[phenotypical|XY]] male. The exact mechanism of fertilization could not be determined but the study stated that it was unlikely to be a case of polar body twinning.<ref name="pmid17165045"/><ref name="Reuters">{{cite web |last1=Dunham |first1=Will |title=Study describes new type of "semi-identical" twins |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twins-identical-idUSN2640130120070326 |website=Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters Trust |access-date=28 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228142954/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twins-identical-idUSN2640130120070326 |archive-date=28 February 2019 |language=en |date=26 March 2007}}</ref>

===Mirror image twins===
Mirror image twins result when a fertilized egg splits later in the embryonic stage than normal timing, around day 9–12. This type of twinning could exhibit characteristics with reversed asymmetry, such as opposite dominant handedness, dental structure, or even organs ([[situs inversus]]).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gedda L, Sciacca A, Brenci G, etal |title=Situs viscerum specularis in monozygotic twins |journal=Acta Genet Med Gemellol (Roma) |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=81–5 |year=1984 |pmid=6540028|doi=10.1017/S0001566000007546 }}</ref> If the split occurs later than this time period, the twins risk being conjoined. There is no DNA-based zygosity test that can determine if twins are indeed mirror image.<ref>[http://www.proactivegenetics.com/faq-twins-genetics.html#55 Twins genetics, details of environmental impacts]. Proactivegenetics.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-10.</ref> The term "mirror image" is used because the twins, when facing each other, appear as matching reflections.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wstwinregistry.org/2015/10/01/what-are-mirror-image-twins/|title=What are mirror image twins? {{!}} Washington State Twin Registry {{!}} Washington State University|date=2015-10-01|work=Washington State Twin Registry|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Language development==
There have been many studies highlighting the [[Language development|development of language]] in twins compared to single-born children. These studies have converged on the notion that there is a greater rate of delay in language development in twins compared to their single-born counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thorpe|first=K|title=Twin children's language development|journal=[[Early Human Development]]|date=June 2006|volume=82|issue=6|pages=387–395|doi=10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2006.03.012|pmid=16690234}}</ref>  The reasons for this phenomenon are still in question; however, [[cryptophasia]] was thought to be the major cause.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Usher|first=L|title=Idioglossia|journal=Times Literary Supplement|date=13 October 2000|page=24}}</ref>  [[Idioglossia]] is defined as a private language that is usually invented by young children, specifically twins. Another term to describe what some people call "twin talk" is cryptophasia where a language is developed by twins that only they can understand.  The increased focused communication between two twins may isolate them from the social environment surrounding them.  Idioglossia has been found to be a rare occurrence and the attention of scientists has shifted away from this idea.  However, there are researchers and scientists that say cryptophasia or idioglossia is not a rare phenomenon. Current research is looking into the impacts of a richer social environment for these twins to stimulate their development of language.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hayashi|first=C|title=Relationship between Twin Language, Twins' Bond, and Social Competence|journal=Twin Research and Human Genetics|year=2007}}</ref>

==Animals==
Twins are common in many mammal species, including [[cat]]s, [[sheep]], [[ferret]]s, [[giant panda]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[dog]]s, [[deer]], [[marmoset]]s, [[tamarin]]s, and [[elephants]]. The incidence of twinning among [[cattle]] is about 1–4%, and research is underway to improve the odds of twinning, which can be more profitable for the breeder if complications can be sidestepped or managed. A female calf that is the twin of a bull becomes partially masculinized and is known as a [[freemartin]].
