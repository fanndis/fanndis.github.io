{{Redirect|MBA||MBA (disambiguation)}}
The '''Master of Business Administration''' ('''MBA''';  also '''Master's in Business Administration''') degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought [[scientific management]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: A school is "a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside": Toward the reinvention of the business school | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}</ref> The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of [[business administration]] such as [[accounting]], [[applied statistics]], [[human resources]], [[business communication]], [[business ethics]], [[business law]], [[Strategy|business strategy]], [[finance]], [[managerial economics]], [[management]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[marketing]], [[supply-chain management]], and [[operations management]] in a manner most relevant to management [[analysis]] and strategy.

Most programs also include [[elective course]]s and concentrations for further study in a particular area, for example, accounting, finance, and marketing. MBA programs in the United States typically require completing about forty to sixty [[Course credit|credits]] (sixty to ninety in a [[Academic quarter (year division)|quarter system]]), much higher than the thirty credits (thirty-six to forty-five in a quarter system) typically required for degrees that cover some of the same material such as the [[Master of Economics]], [[Master of Finance]], [[Master of Accountancy]], [[Master of Science in Marketing]] and [[Master of Science in Management]].

The MBA is a [[terminal degree]] and a [[Professional school|professional degree]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/getting-your-masters-degree.aspx |title=Getting Your Master's Degree |publisher=Peterson's |date=6 December 2013 |access-date=6 October 2014 |quote=A master's degree comes in only two options: a professional, or "terminal" master's degree or an academic master's degree, or an academic master's degree.&nbsp;... A terminal degree is a means to an end; it will prepare you for entrance into a specific type or group of jobs. A terminal degree implies there is no need for any further education, thus the word "terminal." Degrees from professional master's programs are usually marked by specific initials that denote their area of specialties, such as a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A) {{sic}} or Master of Library Science (M.L.S.) degree.&nbsp;... Conversely, an academic degree centers on research and scholarly studies in a specific area. These degrees are more likely to lead to continued education at the doctoral level where you can specialize in a very specific area of that field&nbsp;... |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010113105/http://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/getting-your-masters-degree.aspx |archive-date=10 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Maier| first = Christopher| title = Complete Book of Graduate Programs in the Arts and Sciences| url = https://archive.org/details/completebookofgr00prin| url-access = registration| publisher = Random House| location = New York| date = 2005| page = [https://archive.org/details/completebookofgr00prin/page/4 4]| isbn = 0-375-76432-1|quote="PhD" and "terminal degree" are not synonymous.  A number of master's degrees lead students directly to, well, the end of the formal educational line.  One such example is the MFA, which is earned by practicing artists in fields such as creative writing, visual arts, and theater.  In the world of business administration degrees, an MBA is terminal.  Although a little research might turn up a handful of Ph.D. options in the creative arts or business, these are different monsters; they don't take away from the fact the person with the MFA or the MBA has a terminal degree.}}</ref> [[School accreditation|Accreditation]] bodies specifically for MBA programs ensure consistency and quality of education. Business schools in many countries offer programs tailored to full-time, part-time, [[corporate title|executive]] (abridged coursework typically occurring on nights or weekends) and [[distance learning]] students, many with specialized concentrations.

==History==
The first school of business in the [[United States]] was [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|The Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] established in 1881 through a donation from [[Joseph Wharton]]<sup>[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|[4]]]</sup>. In 1900, the [[Tuck School of Business]] was founded at [[Dartmouth College]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/history/|title=Tuck School of Business History|work=Tuck.dartmouth.edu|access-date=26 July 2013}}</ref> conferring the first [[advanced degree]] in business, specifically, a Master of Science in Commerce, the predecessor to the MBA.<ref name="Stabile2007">{{cite book|author=Donald Stabile|title=Economics, Competition and Academia: An Intellectual History of Sophism Versus Virtue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQNI7BUvYs4C&pg=PA101|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-716-6|pages=101–}}</ref>

The [[Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration]] established the first MBA program in 1908, with 15 faculty members, 33 regular students and 47 special students.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kaplan | first1 = Andreas | year = 2014 | title = European management and European business schools: Insights from the history of business schools | journal = European Management Journal | volume =  32| pages =  529–534| doi = 10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/about/history.html|title=History – About Us – Harvard Business School|work=Hbs.edu|access-date=26 July 2013}}</ref> Its first-year curriculum was based on [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]’s scientific management.

==Accreditation==

===United States===
[[Business school]] or MBA program accreditation by external agencies provides students and employers with an independent view of the school or program's quality, as well as whether the curriculum meets specific quality standards. The three major accrediting bodies in the United States are:
* [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB), 
* [[Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs]] (ACBSP), and
* [[International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education]] (IACBE).<ref>{{Cite journal | ssrn=2144954 | first1 = Kyle E. | last1 = Brink | first2 = Clair | last2 = Smith | title = A Comparison of AACSB, ACBSP, and IACBE Accredited U.S. Business Programs: An Institutional Resource Perspective | journal = Business Education & Accreditation | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages=1–15 | date = 2012 }}</ref>

All of these groups also accredit schools outside the US. The [[ACBSP]] and the [[IACBE]] are themselves recognized in the United States by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chea.org/programmatic-accrediting-organizations|title=CHEA Directory of Programmatic Accrediting Organizations}} Retrieved 23 July 2018</ref> MBA programs with specializations for students pursuing careers in healthcare management also eligible for accreditation by the [[Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education]] (CAHME).

US MBA programs may also be accredited at the institutional level. Bodies that accredit institutions as a whole include:
* [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] (MSA),
* [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] (NEASC),
* [[Higher Learning Commission]] (HLC),
* [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]] (NWCCU),
* [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS), and
* [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC).<ref>{{cite web

===Other countries===
Accreditation agencies outside the United States include the [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA), a UK-based organization that accredits MBA, DBA, and MBM programs worldwide, government accreditation bodies such as the [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE), which accredits MBA and Postgraduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) programs across India. Some of the leading bodies in India that certify MBA institutions and their programs are the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the University Grants Commission (UGC). A distance MBA program needs to be accredited by the Distance Education Council (DEC) in India. The Council on Higher Education (CHE) in South Africa, the [[European Foundation for Management Development]] operates the [[European Quality Improvement System]] (EQUIS) for mostly European, Australian, New Zealand and Asian schools, the [[Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation]] (FIBAA), and [[Central and East European Management Development Association]] (CEEMAN) in Europe.

==Programs==
Full-time MBA programs normally take place over two academic years (i.e. approximately 18 months of term time). For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, they often begin in late August or early September of year one and continue until May or June of year two, with a three to four-month summer break in between years one and two. Students enter with a reasonable amount of prior real-world work experience and take classes during weekdays like other university students. A typical full-time, accelerated, part-time, or modular MBA requires 60 credits (600 class hours) of graduate work.

Accelerated MBA programs are a variation of the two-year programs. They involve a higher course load with more intense class and examination schedules and are usually condensed into one year. They usually have less downtime during the program and between semesters. For example, there is no three to four-month summer break, and between semesters there might be seven to ten days off rather than three to five weeks vacation. Accelerated programs typically have a lower cost than full-time two-year programs.

Part-time MBA programs normally hold classes on weekday evenings after normal working hours, or on weekends. Part-time programs normally last three years or more. The students in these programs typically consist of working professionals, who take a light course load for a longer period of time until the graduation requirements are met.

Evening (second shift) MBA programs are full-time programs that normally hold classes on weekday evenings, after normal working hours, or on weekends for a duration of two years. The students in these programs typically consist of working professionals, who can not leave their work to pursue a full-time regular shift MBA. Most second shift programs are offered at universities in India.

Modular MBA programs are similar to part-time programs, although typically employing a lock-step curriculum with classes packaged together in blocks lasting from one to three weeks.

{{Anchor|Executive MBA (EMBA)}}Executive (part-time) MBA (EMBA) programs developed to meet the educational needs of managers and executives, allowing students to earn an MBA (or another business-related graduate degree) in two years or less while working full-time. Participants come from every type and size of organization – profit, nonprofit, government – representing a variety of industries. EMBA students typically have a higher level of work experience, often 10 years or more, compared to other MBA students. In response to the increasing number of EMBA programs offered, The Executive MBA Council was formed in 1981 to advance executive education.

Full-time executive MBA programs are a new category of full-time 1 year MBA programs aimed at professionals with approx. 5 years or more. They are primarily offered in countries like India where the 2-year MBA program is targeted at fresh graduates with no experience or minimal experience. These full-time executive MBA programs are similar to 1 year MBA programs offered by schools like Insead and IMD.

[[Distance learning]] MBA programs hold classes off-campus. These programs can be offered in a number of different formats: [[correspondence course]]s by [[postal mail]] or email, non-interactive [[broadcast video]], pre-recorded video, live [[teleconference]] or [[videoconference]], offline or online computer courses. Many schools offer these programs.

[[Blended learning]] programs combine distance learning with face-to-face instruction.<ref>{{cite web|author=de l'Etraz, Paris |title=What Can an Online Program Do for You? |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/34-39%20F-Online%20Program.pdf |date=1 November 2009 |publisher=BizEd Magazine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924040945/http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/34-39%20F-Online%20Program.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2014 }}</ref> These programs typically target working professionals who are unable to attend traditional part-time programs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Karen Hebert-Maccaro | title=Blended MBA Programs: An Optimized Form of Learning | url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/business/info/learning/images/pedagogy.pdf | date=8 September 2011 | publisher=Worcester Polytechnic Institute}}</ref>

MBA dual degree programs combine an MBA with others (such as an MS, MA, [[Master of Engineering|MEng]], or a [[Juris Doctor|JD]], etc.) to let students cut costs (dual programs usually cost less than pursuing 2 degrees separately), save time on education and to tailor the business education courses to their needs. This is generally achieved by allowing core courses of one program to count as electives in the other. Some business schools offer programs in which students can earn both a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business administration]] and an MBA in five years.

[[Mini-MBA]] is a term used by many non-profit and [[for-profit]] institutions to describe a [[training]] regimen focused on the fundamentals of business. In the past, Mini-MBA programs have typically been offered as non-credit bearing courses that require less than 100 hours of total learning. However, due to the criticisms of these certificates, many schools have now shifted their programs to offer courses for full credit so that they may be applied towards a complete traditional MBA degree. This is to allow students to verify business-related coursework for employment purposes and still allow the option to complete a full-time MBA degree program at a later period if they elect to do so.

==Admissions criteria==
Many programs base their admission decisions on a combination of undergraduate grade point average, academic transcripts, entrance exam scores, a résumé containing significant work experience, essays, letters of recommendation, group discussions, and personal interviews. Some schools are also interested in extracurricular activities, community service activities, or volunteer work and how the student can improve the school's diversity and contribute to the student body as a whole.

The [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT) is the most prominently used entrance exam for admissions into MBA programs. The [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) is also accepted by almost all MBA programs in order to fulfill any entrance exam requirement they may have.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Kitroeff, Natalie |title=Almost All Business Schools Now Accept the GRE|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-20/gre-at-business-school-most-mba-programs-now-accept-the-gre-too |date=20 October 2014|magazine=Bloomberg Business}}</ref> Some schools do not weigh entrance exam scores as heavily as other criteria, and some programs do not require entrance exam scores for admission. In order to achieve a diverse class, business schools also consider the target male-female ratio and local-international student ratios. In rare cases, some MBA degrees do not require students to have an undergraduate degree and will accept significant management experience in lieu of an undergraduate degree. In the UK, for example, an HND (Higher National Diploma) or even HNC (Higher National Certificate) is acceptable in some programs.

Depending on the program, type and duration of work experience can be a critical admissions component for many MBA programs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why You Should Work Before Pursuing an MBA|url=http://www.bangalorean.co.in/2013/06/why-you-should-work-before-pursuing-mba.html|work=Bangalorean|access-date=19 June 2013}}</ref> Many top-tier programs require five or more years of work experience for admission.<ref>{{cite web|author=MBAapplicant.com |title=Number 5 – YOUR WORK EXPERIENCE:  |url=http://www.mbaapplicant.com/5_experience.htm |date=31 July 2009 |publisher=MBA Applicant.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=SMU Cox|title=Part Time MBA Programs – Side By Side Comparison |url=http://www.cox.smu.edu/web/guest/side-by-side-comparison |date=19 January 2010 |publisher=SMU Cox School of Business}}</ref>

MBA admissions consulting services exist to counsel MBA applicants to improve their chances of getting admission to their desired Business Schools. These services range from evaluating a candidate's profile, GMAT preparation, suggesting the schools to which they can apply, writing and editing essays, conducting mock interviews as preparation for MBA admission interviews, as well as post-MBA career counseling.

==Content==
In general, MBA programs are structured around core courses (an essentially standard curriculum<ref name="Core Courses"/><ref name="MFT-MBA Test Description"/>) and elective courses that (may) allow for a subject specialty or concentration.<ref>[[Graduate Management Admission Council|GMAC's]] [http://www.mba.com/schools-and-programs/evaluating-schools/curriculum-and-course-selection.aspx Curriculum and Course Selection].</ref> Thus, 
in the program's first year (or part), students acquire both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills required for these, while in the second year (part), students pursue elective courses, which may count towards a specialization.  (Topics in [[business ethics]] may be included at the generalist or specialist level.) After the first year, many full-time students seek [[internship]]s. The degree culminates with coursework in [[business strategy]], the program capstone. A [[dissertation]] or [[Project#School and university|major project]] is usually a degree requirement after the completion of coursework.  Many MBA programs end with a comprehensive exit examination; see below.

For Executive MBA programs, the core curriculum is generally similar, but may seek to leverage the strengths associated with the more seasoned and professional profile of the student body, emphasizing leadership, and drawing more from the specific experience of the individual students.<ref>[http://www.rutgers.edu.sg/emba-program/executive-mba-emba-vs-traditional-mba-full-timepart-time Executive MBA (EMBA) vs. Traditional MBA], rutgers.edu.sg</ref><ref>[https://www.insead.edu/m-programmes/MBA-vs-EMBA EXECUTIVE MBA VS MBA: THE DIFFERENCE], insead.edu</ref>

Programs are designed such that students gain exposure to theory and practice alike.<ref>See for example: [http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx "The HBS case-method", hbs.edu]; [http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/chicago-approach "The Chicago Approach", chicagobooth.edu]; [http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mba/learning/practical-learning/ "Practical Learning", jbs.cam.ac.uk]; [http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/academic-experience "Academic Experience", gsb.stanford.edu].</ref> Courses include lectures, case studies, and team projects; the mix though, will differ by school<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronaldyeaple/2012/07/09/is-the-mba-case-method-passe/|title=Is the MBA Case Method Passé?|first=Ronald|last=Yeaple}}</ref> and [[#Programs|by format]]. Theory is covered in the classroom setting by [[professor|academic faculty]], and is reinforced through the [[case method]], placing the student in the role of the decision maker. Similar to real world business situations, cases include both constraints and incomplete information. Practical learning (field immersion) often comprises [[management consulting|consulting projects]] with real clients, and is generally undertaken in teams (or "syndicates").<ref>{{cite web |title=MBA Consulting Projects |url=https://www.darden.virginia.edu/mba/academics/experiential-learning/consulting/ |website=Darden School of Business UVA |access-date=15 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheffin |first1=Joseph |title=Sustainable Global Enterprise – An Experience in Combining Perspectives |url=https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/Programs/Full-Time-MBA/Two-Year-MBA/Curriculum/Immersion-Learning/Immersion-Article/ArticleId/43788/Sustainable-Global-Enterprise-An-Experience-in-Combining-Perspectives |website=Cornell SC Johnson College of Business |access-date=15 December 2018}}</ref> The practical elements (as well as the case studies) often involve [[Clinical professor|external practitioners]]—sometimes business executives—supporting the teaching from academic faculty.

As above, courses begin with underlying topics<ref name="Core Courses">See: [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB's]] [http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/business/standards/aol/standard15.asp Standard 15: Management of Curricula]; [[Association of MBAs|AMBA's]] [http://www.mbaworld.com/accreditationcriteria New Accreditation Criteria]; [[Educational Testing Service|ETS's]] [http://www.ets.org/mft/about/content/mba Major Field Test for the MBA].</ref> and then progress to more advanced functional topics where these are applied; see aside.

The analytic skills required for management are usually covered initially.  
The accounting course(s) may treat [[financial accounting|financial]] and [[management accounting]] separately or in one hybrid course.  Financial accounting deals mainly in the preparation of financial statements while management accounting deals mainly in the analysis of internal results. 
The economics course covers [[managerial economics]], a technical course that mainly focuses on product pricing as influenced by microeconomic theory, and aggregate-or [[macroeconomics]], which deals with topics like the banking system, the money supply, and inflation. 
[[Operations Research]] and statistics are sometimes combined as "Managerial Decision-Making" or "[[Business mathematics#Postgraduate|Quantitative Decision-Making]]"; 
organizational behavior and human resource management may similarly be combined. 
In many programs, applicants with appropriate background may be exempt from various analytical courses.

As regards the functional courses, some programs treat the curricula here in two parts: the first course provides an overview, while the second revisits the subject in-depth (perhaps as specializations); alternatively, the first addresses short-term, tactical problems, while the second addresses long-term, strategic problems (e.g., "Financial Management I" might cover [[working capital management]], while part II covers [[Corporate finance#Investment and project valuation|capital investment decisions]]).  An [[Information systems]] / [[Information technology|technology]] course is increasingly included as a core functional course rather than an elective. Ethics training is often delivered with coursework in corporate social responsibility and corporate governance. Note that courses here, although technical in the content are, ultimately, oriented toward corporate management. (For example, the principal finance course may cover the technicalities of financial instrument valuation and [[Capital market|capital raising]], but is in fact focused on [[managerial finance]] and [[financial management]].)  Technically-oriented courses, if offered, will be via a specialization.

Programs may also include (coursework-based) training in the skills needed at senior levels of management: [[soft skills]], such as (general) leadership and negotiation; hard skills, such as [[spreadsheets]] and project management; [[Outline of thought#Creative processes|thinking skills]] such as [[innovation]] and creativity. Training in areas such as [[multiculturalism]] and corporate social responsibility is similarly included. Company visits (including overseas travel), and guest lectures or seminars with CEOs and [[Business guru|management personalities]] may also be included. These, with the core subjects, provide the graduate with breadth, while the specialty courses provide depth.

For the business strategy component, the degree capstone, the focus is on finding [[competitive advantage]] and the long-term positioning and management of the entity as a whole.  Here, the key functional areas are thus synthesized or integrated into an overall view and the strategy course depicts how the various sub-disciplines integrate to tell one continuous story with each discipline complementing the others.  Corresponding training in [[entrepreneurial leadership|business leadership]] may also be scheduled and participation in a [[business simulation]] or [[business game|game]] is also a common degree requirement. "Strategy" may be offered as a sequence of courses, beginning in the first part (planning) and culminating in the second (execution), or as a single intensive course, offered during the second part. Some programs offer a specialization in "strategy", others in management consulting which substantially addresses the same issues.

The MBA dissertation (or thesis in some universities) will, in general, comprise the following in some combination:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kangis | first1 = Peter | last2 = Carman | first2 = Robert | title = Research, Knowledge and Method: the purpose and role of MBA dissertation | url = http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/bmaf/documents/publications/ijme/vol1no2/kangis_purpose_of_mba_dissert.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The International Journal of Management Education | volume = 1 | issue = 2 }}</ref> a [[literature review|discussion of the literature]], providing a critical review and structuring of what is known on a given topic, to address a specific problem; a [[case study]] that goes beyond simple description, containing the analysis of hitherto unpublished material; a test of the application or limitations of some known principle or technique in a particular situation, and/or suggested modifications. As an alternative to the dissertation, some programs instead allow for a major project.<ref name="degree.net"/> Here (part-time) students will address a problem current in their organization; particularly in programs with an [[action learning]] orientation, these may be practically oriented.<ref name="degree.net">[http://www.degree.net/resources/degree-level/mba-degree-guide_201002182375.html MBA degree-guide], degree.net</ref> Most MBA programs require additional course work in research methodology, preceding the dissertation or project. Some programs allow that the research component as a whole may be substituted with additional elective coursework.

===Exit examination===
Many MBA programs culminate in a [[Comprehensive examination|comprehensive exit examination]]. The national [[standardized exam]] known as the [[Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration|Major Field Test for MBAs]] (MFT-MBA) has been administered in the MBA programs of over 300 U.S. universities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |title=2013 Major Field Test Comparative Data Guide: Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MBA) |publisher=Educational Testing Service |access-date=20 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194137/http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |archive-date=22 January 2014 }}</ref> The MFT-MBA aims to assess skills, knowledge, and reasoning ability within the domain of standard MBA curriculum.<ref name="MFT-MBA Test Description">{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/mft_mba_flyer.pdf |title=MFT-MBA Test Description |publisher=Educational Testing Service |access-date=20 July 2014}}</ref> It is administered by [[Educational Testing Service]]. Another prominent option for comprehensive exit exams is the Common Professional Component Comprehensive Exam for MBAs (CPC COMP Exam for MBAs) owned by Peregrine Academic Services.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.peregrineacademics.com/media.ashx/exam-summary-business-compgraduatefinal29oct2014.pdf |title=Business Administration CPC-Based COMP Exam Summary: Masters Level |publisher=Peregrine Academic Services |access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref> Many programs choose to administer their own in-house exam rather than a standardized test.

== Europe ==
{{main|List of business schools in Europe}}

===History===
In 1957, [[INSEAD]] (French name "Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires", or European Institute of Business Administration) became the first European university offering the MBA degree,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Kaplan A.: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools, European Management Journal, 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}</ref> followed by [[EDHEC]] Business School in 1959 and [[ICADE]] in 1960 (who had started offering in 1956 a "Technical Seminary for Business Administration"),<ref>[http://www.icade.es/presentacion/pres_hist.aspx?nivel=3&id=90 Historia de la Universidad Pontificia Comillas].

Vlerick.com. Retrieved on 26 July 2013.</ref> and in 1969 by the [[HEC School of Management]] (in French, the École des Hautes Études Commerciales) and the [[Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]]. In 1972, Swiss business school [[IMEDE]] (now [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]]) began offering a full-time MBA program, followed by [[IE Business School]] (in Spanish, Instituto de Empresas) in 1973, and AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, Poland in 1974. In 1991, [[IEDC-Bled School of Management]] became the first school in the ex-socialist bloc of the Central and Eastern to offer an MBA degree.

===Bologna Accord===
In Europe, the recent [[Bologna Accord]] established uniformity in three levels of higher education: Bachelor (three or four years), Masters (one or two years, in addition to three or four years for a Bachelor), and Doctorate (an additional three or four years after a Master). Students can acquire professional experience after their initial bachelor's degree at any European institution and later complete their masters in any other European institution via the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]].

===Accreditation standards===
Accreditation standards are not uniform in Europe. Some countries have legal requirements for accreditation (e.g. most German states), in some, there is a legal requirement only for universities of a certain type (e.g. Austria), and others have no accreditation law at all. Even where there is no legal requirement, many business schools are [[School accreditation|accredited]] by independent bodies voluntarily to ensure quality standards.

===Austria===
<!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS -->
In Austria, MBA programs of [[private university|private universities]] have to be accredited by the Austrian Accreditation Council (''Österreichischer Akkreditierungsrat''). State-run universities have no accreditation requirements, however, some of them voluntarily undergo accreditation procedures by independent bodies. There are also MBA programs of non-academic business schools, who are entitled by the Austrian government to offer these programs until the end of 2012 (''Lehrgang universitären Charakters''). Some non-academic institutions cooperate with state-run universities to ensure the legality of their degrees.

===Czech Republic===
<!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS -->
January 1999 saw the first meeting of the Association of the Czech MBA Schools (CAMBAS). The association is housed within the Centre for Doctoral and Managerial Studies of UEP, Prague. All of the founding members of the association to have their MBA programs accredited by partner institutions in the United Kingdom or the United States of America.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The university of Finance and administration Prague|url=http://www.shortcoursesportal.eu/universities/1176/the-university-of-finance-and-administration-prague.html#tab:about|journal=Shortcoursesportal.eu}}</ref>

===France and French-speaking countries===
<!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS -->
In France and the [[Francophone]] countries such as Switzerland, Monaco, Belgium, and Canada, the MBA degree programs at the public accredited schools are similar to those offered in the [[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] countries. Most French Business Schools are accredited by the [[Conférence des grandes écoles (CGE)|Conférence des Grandes Écoles]], which is an association of higher educational establishments outside the mainstream framework of the public education system.

===Germany===
<!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS -->
Germany was one of the last Western countries to adopt an MBA degree. In 1998, the ''Hochschulrahmengesetz'' (Higher Education Framework Act), a German federal law regulating higher education including the types of degrees offered, was modified to permit German universities to offer master's degrees. The traditional German degree in business administration was the [[Diplom]] in ''Betriebswirtschaft'' (Diplom-Kaufmann) but since 1999, bachelor's and master's degrees have gradually replaced the traditional degrees due to the [[Bologna process]]. Today most German business schools offer an MBA. Most [[States of Germany|German states]] require that MBA degrees have to be accredited by one of the six agencies officially recognized by the German ''Akkreditierungsrat''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akkreditierungsrat.de/index.php?id=44&L=1|work=Akkreditierungsrat.de|title=Accreditation Council}}</ref> (accreditation council), the German counterpart to the American [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation|CHEA]]. The busiest of these six agencies (with respect to MBA degrees) is the Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation (FIBAA). All universities themselves have to be institutionally accredited by the state (''staatlich anerkannt'').

===Italy===

For example, 2/3 of all case studies are based on real conditions of Ukrainian companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbastrategy.ua/content/view/1078/312/lang,Eng/|title=MBA in Ukraine - MBA, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS,  бизнес-школы, Pre-MBA, бизнес образование.|website=www.mbastrategy.ua}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
<!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS -->
The UK-based [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA) was established in 1967 and is an active advocate for MBA degrees.

==Asia-Pacific==
{{main|List of business schools in Asia}}
International MBA programs are acquiring brand value in Asia. For example, while a foreign MBA is still preferred in the Philippines, many students are now studying at one of many "Global MBA" English language programs being offered. English-only MBA programs are also offered in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. For international students who want a different experience, many Asian programs offer scholarships and discounted tuition to encourage an international environment in the classroom.

Rankings have been published for Asia Pacific schools by the magazine [[Asia Inc.]] which is a regional business magazine with distribution worldwide. The importance of MBA education in China has risen, too.<ref>Alon, Ilan and John R. McIntyre, eds.

===Bangladesh===
<!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS -->
There are now more than 50 business schools in Bangladesh offering the MBA, predominantly targeting graduates without any work experience. Most MBAs are two years full-time. Sensibly there is little use of GMAT. The Business Schools conduct their own admission tests instead although the rationale for this instead of providing introductory courses and certifications is unclear. Classes are taught in English.

===Japan===
<!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS -->

In Japan, 2 business schools offer an accredited MBA degree (AACSB, AMBA, or EQUIS). The concept of an MBA is still not considered mainstream as traditional companies still perceive that knowledge and learning with respect to business and management can only be effectively gained through experience and not within a classroom. In fact, some companies have been known to place recent MBA recipients in unrelated fields, or try to re-acclimate their Japanese employees who have spent years overseas earning the degree. As a consequence, academic institutions in Japan are attempting to reinvent the perception of the MBA degree, by taking into account the local corporate culture.<ref>{{cite news|author=The New York Times | title=M.B.A.s in Japan Struggle for Respect

* The [[Aspen Institute]] publishes the ''Beyond Grey Pinstripes'' rankings which are based on the integration of social and environmental stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. Rankings from a small sample of well-known schools are calculated on the amount of [[sustainability]] coursework made available to students (20%), amount of student exposure to relevant material (25%), amount of coursework focused on stewardship by for-profit corporations (30%), and relevant faculty research (25%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|title=Methodology|access-date=18 June 2011|publisher=Beyond Grey Pinstripes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718165449/http://beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|archive-date=18 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The 2011 survey and ranking include data from 150 universities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Judy|title=The Business of Education: Why change-minded MBA candidates turn to the Institute before they pick a business school|journal=The Aspen Idea|date=Summer 2011|pages=66–67|url=http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|access-date=18 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712011811/http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|archive-date=12 July 2011}}</ref>

* ''Forbes'' considers only the return of investment five years after graduation. MBA alumni are asked about their salary, the tuition fees of their MBA program, and other direct costs as well as opportunity costs involved. Based on this data, a final "5-year gain" is calculated and determines the MBA ranking position.<ref name="Forbes 'The Best Business Schools'">{{cite news|title=Forbes 'The Best Business Schools'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2011/08/03/the-best-business-schools/|access-date=3 August 2011|date=3 August 2011}}</ref>

The ranking of MBA programs has been discussed in articles and on academic websites.<ref>{{cite web |title=Caution and Controversy |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] |url=http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm |access-date=6 September 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081654/http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm |archive-date=26 October 2007 }}</ref> Critics of ranking methodologies maintain that any published rankings should be viewed with caution for the following reasons:<ref name="MRN">
{{cite journal|last=Schatz |first=Martin |title=What's Wrong with MBA Ranking Surveys? |journal=Management Research News |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=15–18 |year=1993 |url=http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |doi=10.1108/eb028322 |last2=Crummer |first2=Roy E. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110850/http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |archive-date=12 April 2013}}</ref>
* Rankings exhibit intentional selection bias as they limit the surveyed population to a small number of MBA programs and ignore the majority of schools, many with excellent offerings.
* Ranking methods may be subject to personal biases and statistically flawed methodologies (especially methods relying on subjective interviews of hiring managers, students, or faculty).
* Rankings use no objective measures of program quality.
* The same list of schools appears in each ranking with some variation in ranks, so a school ranked as number 1 in one list may be number 17 in another list.
* Rankings tend to concentrate on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).
* A high rank in a national publication tends to become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].
* Some leading business schools including Harvard, INSEAD, Wharton and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan]] provide limited cooperation with certain ranking publications due to their perception that rankings are misused.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hemel |first=Daniel J |title=HBS Blocks Media Access to Students |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=12 April 2004 |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=358753 |access-date=29 January 2008}}</ref>

One study found that ranking MBA programs by a combination of graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can approximately duplicate the top 20 list of the national publications, and concluded that a truly objective ranking would use objective measures of program quality and be individualized to the needs of each prospective student.<ref name="MRN" /> National publications have recognized the value of rankings against different criteria and now offer lists ranked different ways: by salary, GMAT score of students, selectivity, and so forth. While useful, these rankings have yet to meet the critique that rankings are not tailored to individual needs, that they use an incomplete population of schools, may fail to distinguish between the different MBA program types offered by each school, or rely on subjective interviews.

==Criticism==
The media raised questions about the value and content of business school programs after the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. In general, graduates had reportedly tended to go into finance after receiving their degrees.<ref name="retrain">{{cite news|author=Holland, Kelley | title=Is It Time to Retrain B-Schools? | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/y15/business/15school.html | date=14 March 2009 | newspaper=The New York Times}}{{Dead Link|date=August 2020}}</ref> As financial professionals are widely seen as responsible for the global economic meltdown, anecdotal evidence suggests new graduates are choosing different career paths.<ref>{{cite news|author=Stossel, John | title=The New Normal | publisher=ABC News | newspaper=20/20 | date=19 June 2009}}</ref>

Deans at top business schools have acknowledged that media and public perception of the MBA degree shifted as a result of the financial crisis.<ref name="overhaul">{{cite news | author=Bradshaw, Della | title=Deans fight crisis fires with MBA overhaul | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a2353870-53c4-11de-be08-00144feabdc0.html | date=18 June 2009 |newspaper=Financial Times}}</ref> Articles have been written about public perceptions of the crisis, ranging from schools' acknowledgment of issues with the training students receive<ref name="retrain"/><ref name="overhaul"/> to criticisms of the MBA's role in society.<ref>{{cite magazine | author=Stewart, Matthew | title=RIP, MBA | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/29895258 | date=25 March 2009 | magazine=Slate}}</ref>

The MBA title has acquired a mixed reputation in that the MBA curriculum tends to educate students in the "[[greed]] is good" direction based on various simplistic assumptions about human behavior.<ref name="Parker 2018">{{cite web | last=Parker | first=Martin | title=Why we should bulldoze the business school | website=the Guardian | date=27 April 2018 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/27/bulldoze-the-business-school | access-date=24 May 2018|quote=There are 13,000 business schools on Earth.
