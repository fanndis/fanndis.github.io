'''Alpha Condé''' (born 4 March 1938) is a [[Guinea]]n politician who has been [[President of Guinea]] since December 2010. He spent decades in opposition to a succession of regimes in Guinea, unsuccessfully running against President [[Lansana Conté]] in the 1993 and 1998 presidential elections and leading the [[Rally of the Guinean People]] (RPG), an opposition party. Standing again in the [[2010 Guinean presidential election|2010 presidential election]], Condé was elected president in a second round of voting. When he took office that December, he became the first freely elected president in the country's history. Condé was [[2015 Guinean presidential election|reelected in 2015]] with about 58% of the vote.<ref name="ceni-results-2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceniguinee.org/attachments/article/137/ceni_recapitulatif_general_election_presidentielle_resultat_synthese.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2015|title=SYNTHESE DES RESULTATS PROVISOIRES Election Présidentielle du 11 Octobre 2015|language=French|publisher=Commission Electorale Nationale Indépendante|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023070051/http://www.ceniguinee.org/attachments/article/137/ceni_recapitulatif_general_election_presidentielle_resultat_synthese.pdf|archive-date=23 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Early life==
Condé was born on 4 March 1938 in [[Boké|Boke]] in [[Maritime Guinea|Lower Guinea]]. His parents were from [[Baro, Guinea|Baro]], a small town in [[Kouroussa Prefecture]] in the [[Kankan Region]] of Upper Guinea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environnement-guinee.info/Single-News.408.0.html?&cHash=774db962b8&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=406&tx_ttnews%5BpS%5D=1301784087&tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=84&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=6324 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323134226/http://www.environnement-guinee.info/Single-News.408.0.html?&cHash=774db962b8&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=406&tx_ttnews%5BpS%5D=1301784087&tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=84&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=6324 |archivedate=23 March 2014}}.</ref>

Condé left for France at the age of 15. He was active in the National Union of Higher Education (SNESUP), the Association of Guinean students in France (AEGF), and the Federation of Black African Students in France (FEANF), of which he was the Executive Coordinator of African National Groups (NG) from 1967 to 1975, overseeing the activities of the Directorate of FEANF.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Condé wrote a master's thesis in political science, ''Le P.D.G. et le peuple de Guinée'', in 1965.<ref name="worldcatlepdgetlepeupledeguinee">{{cite book|title=Le P.D.G. et le peuple de Guinée.|oclc=26537950}}</ref>

==Political career==
[[File:Alpha Conde - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012.jpg|thumb|200px|Conde during the [[World Economic Forum|WEF]] 2012]]
Condé won 19.6 percent of the vote in [[1993 Guinean presidential election|Guinea's first multiparty presidential election]], held on 19 December 1993. [[Lansana Conté]], who had been president since a bloodless 1984 ''[[coup d'etat]]'', won that election with 51.7 percent of the vote. Condé's supporters alleged fraud in this election after the [[Supreme Court of Guinea|Supreme Court]] nullified results in the [[Kankan]] and [[Siguiri]] prefectures, where Condé had received more than 90 percent of the vote.<ref name="englebert2006">Englebert, Pierre. (2006) Guinea: recent history. In ''Africa south of the Sahara 2006'', 35th ed. London: Routledge.</ref> In the [[1998 Guinean presidential election|1998 presidential election]], Condé ran again and received 17.6 percent of the vote, placing third behind Conté (56.1 percent) and [[Mamadou Boye Bâ]] (24.6 percent). On 16 December, two days after the poll, Condé was arrested and charged with trying to leave the country illegally; he was also charged with attempting to recruit forces to destabilize the government.<ref name="englebert2006"/>

Controversy during his detention focused on whether he could be represented by foreign as well as domestic lawyers, and whether defense lawyers were being given full access to him in jail. Condé's trial, initially scheduled to begin in September 1999, did not begin until April 2000. Condé, along with 47 co-defendants, was charged with hiring mercenaries, planning to assassinate President Conté, and upsetting the state's security. Defense lawyers began by calling for the judge to immediately release their clients, then quit, saying that under the circumstances they could not properly make a defense. The trial was thus delayed several times, during which time Condé refused to speak in court, and his co-defendants denied all of the charges. The trial finally continued in August, and in mid-September Condé was sentenced to jail for five years.<ref name="englebert2006"/>

However, Condé was released in May 2001 when he was pardoned by President Conté, with the condition that he was prohibited from engaging in political activities.<ref name="englebert2006"/> Following his release, he left Guinea for France, returning in July 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=55250 |title=Guinea: Opposition leader returns as food tensions mount |work=[[The New Humanitarian|IRIN]] |date=4 July 2005}}</ref> Upon his return, some reports indicated that he intended to organize the RPG for the municipal elections held in late 2005, but later stated his intention to boycott them.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=55525 |title=Guinea: Opposition split over whether to take part in municipal elections |work=[[The New Humanitarian|IRIN]] |date=20 July 2005}}</ref>

Following Conté's death and the [[2008 Guinean coup d'etat|23 December 2008 military coup]], Condé met with [[Moussa Dadis Camara]], the President of the [[National Council for Democracy and Development]] (CNDD), on 27 December 2008. After the meeting, Condé said that the members of the CNDD junta were "patriots".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLR178986 |title=Guinea coup leader gets Senegal's backing |work=[[Reuters]] |date=27 December 2008}}</ref> Later, however, he opposed the junta{{Why?|date=July 2011}} and was criticised by Camara.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gu5-PDqaGyy9lFOPMuu6NtgydAGw |title=Guinea junta chief 'holed up in Burkina villa' |work=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=20 February 2010}}</ref>

===2010 election===
{{POV section|date=July 2020}}
Condé stood again in the [[2010 Guinean presidential election|June&ndash;November 2010 presidential election]]. During the first round, he received 18 percent of the votes, while [[Cellou Dalein Diallo]] placed first with over 40 percent. On 15 November 2010 Condé was declared the winner of the second round with 52.5 percent.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Samb|first1=Saliou|title=Alpha Conde wins Guinea vote|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/16/us-guinea-election-idUSTRE6AE20P20101116|accessdate=31 July 2015|agency=Reuters|date=15 November 2010}}</ref> Observers of the election noted that his win was surprising given his poor results in the first round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/3599319/asset-management-hedge-funds-and-alternatives/dan-ochs-african-nightmare.html?ArticleId=3599319&single=true#.WQW3KGnyvJQ|title=Dan Och's African Nightmare|website=www.institutionalinvestor.com|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref> A report prepared by the [[Carter Center]] noted several irregularities in voter registration, vote counting and the loss of nearly 1 million voters from the final count. The Carter Center criticized the decision by the Supreme Court of Guinea to proceed to a second round of voting. Despite claims of election corruption, Alpha Condé was sworn in on 21 December 2010.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 2011, Palladino Capital 2, an investment company run by South African billionaire [[Walter Hennig]], lent Guinea $25 million allegedly in order to fund the establishment of a state mine.  But it soon became evident that the money was not used as intended and the terms were detrimental to Guinea. Furthermore, according to former Guinean Minister of Mines Mahmoud Thiam, the deal included a commitment to support Condé's political campaign.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2012-06-28-tokyo-linked-company-in-guinea-row/|title=Tokyo-linked company in Guinea row|last=Wood|first=Craig McKune, Stefaans Brummer & James|work=The M&G Online|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en}}</ref> In 2012, after extensive public criticism the loan was returned and the deal was cancelled.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/african-deal-for-mines-is-scrapped-as-valuation-fears-mount-7876674.html|title=African deal for mines is scrapped as valuation fears mount|date=2012-06-23|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en-GB}}</ref>

After he was elected, Condé seemingly attempted to improve the mining law in Guinea, in order to reduce corruption in the sector and increase the country's benefit.<ref name="Smith"/> However, as revealed in 2016<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/business/dealbook/bribery-arrest-may-expose-african-mining-rights-scandal-tied-to-och-ziff.html|title=Bribery Arrest May Expose African Mining Rights Scandal Tied to Och-Ziff|last=Stevenson|first=Alexandra|date=2016-08-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Samuel Mebiame]], who had been involved in bribing high-level government officials in return for mining rights in the country, was also involved in rewriting the mining law in a manner that benefited the companies with which he was working.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-18/u-s-case-into-fixer-for-och-ziff-venture-gets-support-in-guinea|title=U.S. Case into Fixer for Och-Ziff Venture Gets Support in Guinea|date=2016-08-18|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref>

According to various documents that were leaked to the international NGO [[Global Witness]], mining company Sable Mining was involved in helping Condé win the 2010 election in return for mining rights in the country. Global Witness reported that Sable Supported Condé's election campaign, organized logistics and strategic meetings, offered to loan him a helicopter, and paid bribe money to his son, Alpha Mohammed Condé,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/sable-mining-liberia-guinea-idUSL5N18G5AL|title=Guinea says to work with Global Witness over corruption allegations|date=20 May 2016|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref> in order to secure mining permits in a number of areas, including Mount Nimba. In an email sent from Alpha Mohammed Condé to Sable in August 2010, he said that backing his father's campaign "will make my dad all the more comfortable to support our business partnerships".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalwitness.org/thedeceivers/|title=The Deceivers|last=Witness|first=Global|access-date=2017-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220020410/https://www.globalwitness.org/thedeceivers/|archive-date=20 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Assassination attempt===
On 19 July 2011, the presidential residence was shelled, resulting in the death of a presidential guard and the injuries of two others; Condé, however, survived the assassination attempt.<ref name="aljaz">[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/07/201172245517512476.html "Guinea arrests troops after assassination bid"], Al Jazeera, 22 July 2011.</ref> A former army chief and a member of the presidential guard were arrested hours after the two attacks on his house. The President later spoke to the country saying that "My house was attacked last night, but I congratulate the presidential guard who fought heroically from 3:10 until 5:00 before backup arrived." He also added that his plans for reform would not fail.<ref>{{cite news|title=Post-attack, Guinea tells investors country is under control |url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/post-attack-guinea-tells-investors-country-is-under-control/ |agency=Associated Press |date=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606153853/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/post-attack-guinea-tells-investors-country-is-under-control/ |archivedate=6 June 2012 }}</ref>

Three days later at least 41 soldiers were arrested for the assassination attempt. A government official said that many of those arrested had ties to the country's previous military rulers.

The United Nations reacted by saying that there was a greater need for military reforms in Guinea. The UN Special Representative for West Africa, [[Said Djinnit]], said that the assault showed "weaknesses remain in Guinea's defence and security systems [and] reinforces the UN's determination to support the country's military reforms. I saw the damage...[the attack] clearly intended to kill the president."<ref name="aljaz"/>

===2013 pre-election violence===
{{See also|2013 Guinea clashes}}
Condé received criticism during week-long protests and violence in late February and early March 2013, after opposition supporters took to the streets of [[Conakry]] to protest against his alleged attempts to rig the [[2013 Guinean legislative election|2013 parliamentary election]]. The opposition coalition withdrew from the electoral process in mid-February, mainly due to Condé's insistence on using a South African firm, [[Waymark Infotech]] [https://mg.co.za/article/2014-09-11-sa-spooks-fixed-guinea-poll] , to draw up the registered voter list.

[[File:Vladimir Putin and Alpha Condé (2017-09-28) 1.jpg|thumb|Condé with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], 2017]]
The ensuing violence resulted in at least nine deaths and hundreds injured, many from the alleged brutality of the security forces who reportedly used live ammunition to disperse some of the crowds.<ref>{{cite web| title= Security forces break up Guinea opposition funeral march| publisher= Reuters| url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/03/08/uk-guinea-clashes-idUKBRE92714Z20130308 |  date= 8 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=SAL>{{cite web| title=Guinea electoral body appoints South African firm | author=Salon| work=Salon| url=http://www.salon.com/2013/02/15/guinea_electoral_body_appoints_south_african_firm/|  date=15 February 2013}}</ref>

Voting finally took place on 28 September but local and international observers claimed the process was significantly flawed, they observed ballot stuffing, voter intimidation, and minors casting votes. These organizational problems and irregularities led to a three-week delay in the announcement of the election results, which in turn led to further tension. At this point regional UN and EU representatives intervened<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/guinea|title=World Report 2014: Guinea|date=2014-01-08|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en}}</ref> and strongly recommended that the situation be addressed peacefully via the legal system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/guinea-elections-alpha-conde-diallo|title=Guinean opposition disputes election|last=Bensimon|first=Cyril|date=2013-10-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

===2016 corruption allegations===
In 2016, French news organization [[FRANCE 24]] released audio recordings that appear to prove that the mining company [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] paid Guinean government official and close acquaintance of the president {{ILL|François de Combret|fr}} a sum of $10.5 million for mining rights in the [[Simandou mine]]. President Condé says that de Combret acted alone. Audio recordings do not implicate the president as there is no indication in it that he was not simply demanding down payment on the $700 million contract on behalf of the government with no payoff involved. Rio Tinto admitted to the payment in November 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20161201-exclusive-audio-recordings-guinea-president-conde-simandou-mine-bribery-rio-tinto|title=Audio recordings drag Guinea president into mine bribery scandal - France 24|date=2016-12-01|work=France 24|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en-US}}</ref>
