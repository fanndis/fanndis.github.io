Indiana Asbury University was founded in 1837 in Greencastle, Indiana, and was named after [[Francis Asbury]], the first American bishop of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. The people of Greencastle raised $25,000, equivalent to around $500,000 in 2007 terms, to entice the Methodists to found the college in Greencastle, which was little more than a village at the time.  It was originally established as an all men's school, but began admitting women in 1867.{{citation needed | date= October 2015}}

In 1884 Indiana Asbury University changed its name to DePauw University in honor of [[Washington C. DePauw]], who made a sequence of substantial donations throughout the 1870s, which culminated in his largest single donation that established the [[Music school|School of Music]] during 1884.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://my.depauw.edu/library/archives/ehistory/chapter2/wdepauw.html|title= Washington C. DePauw
|publisher= DePauw University|accessdate= October 4, 2012}}</ref> Before his death in 1887, DePauw donated over $600,000 to Indiana Asbury, equal to around $13&nbsp;million in 2007. In 2002, the school received the largest-ever gift to a liberal arts college, $128&nbsp;million by the Holton family.

Sigma Delta Chi, known today as the [[Society of Professional Journalists]], was founded at the university in 1909 by a group of student journalists, including [[Eugene C. Pulliam]]. The world's first Greek-letter sorority, [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], was also founded at DePauw in 1870. DePauw is home to the two longest continually running fraternity chapters in the world: the Delta chapter of [[Beta Theta Pi]] and the Lambda chapter of [[Phi Gamma Delta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/studentlife/greek/councilschapters/depauwchapters/|title=DePauw Chapters|work=DePauw University|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}</ref> DePauw is home to {{citation needed span|text=Indiana's first chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].|date=October 2015}}

===Academic calendar and winter term===
DePauw University's schedule is divided into a 4–1–4-1 calendar: besides the 15-week Autumn and Spring Semesters, there is also a 4-week Winter Term as well as a May Term. Students take one course during these terms, which is either used as a period for students to explore a subject of interest on campus or participate in off-campus domestic or international [[internship]] programs, service trips, or international trips and field studies.  One survey of DePauw students found that over 80% of DePauw graduates studied abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opendoors.iienetwork.org/?p=113744|title=IIENETWORK.ORG|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}</ref> Past internships for Winter Term include ABC News, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Riley Hospital for Children, and Eli Lilly and Company.

The School of Music grants degrees in music performance, music education, and musical arts. The latter allows students to add an emphasis in music business or administration. DePauw music students can also double major in another field outside of music in the typical four year period, or can study a Bachelor's of Music and a Bachelor's of Arts in a five year course. The DePauw Symphony Orchestra is an audition ensemble for both music and non-music majors. In 2019, the orchestra toured Japan. The DePauw University Choir is an ensemble open to both music and nonmusic majors, while the DePauw Chamber Choir is much smaller and more selective. The symphony and both choirs make an international tour every other year during Winter Term.

===Honors and Fellows Programs===
DePauw students can apply for entry to five Programs of Distinction. There are the Honor Scholars and Information Technology Associates programs as well as three fellowships in Management, Media, and Science Research.

The '''Honor Scholar Program''' is an interdisciplinary journey for talented students who want the highest level of intellectual rigor.  The program includes 5 interdisciplinary seminars and an 80–120-page honor thesis in the student's senior year.

'''Management Fellows''' are the top students interested in business and economics. The program includes special seminars, speakers and a paid, semester-long internship during the junior year.

===Greek organizations===
{{main|DePauw University Greek organizations}}

DePauw's Greek system began just eight years after the founding of Indiana Asbury College in 1837. The Delta chapter of [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity was established here in 1845, [[Phi Gamma Delta]] (commonly known as Fiji) in 1856, [[Sigma Chi]] in 1859, [[Phi Kappa Psi]] in 1865, [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] in 1866, [[Phi Delta Theta]] in 1868, [[Delta Tau Delta]] in 1871, [[Delta Upsilon]] in 1887, [[Sigma Nu]] in 1890, and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] in 1949.

Women were first admitted to Indiana Asbury in 1867. The first Greek letter fraternity for women soon followed. In January 1870, [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] was founded at DePauw as the world's first Greek letter fraternity known among women. [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] established a chapter at DePauw in 1875. Notably, [[Alpha Chi Omega]] became the second Alpha Chapter established at DePauw, after Theta, when it was founded here in 1885.

Just under 70 percent of students at DePauw are affiliated with a Greek-letter organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.depauw.edu/studentacademiclife/greek/gogreek/|title=Go Greek|website=DePauw University}}</ref>

===Greek life===
For 2014, DePauw University was again ranked #1 in Greek Life by the ''[[Princeton Review]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/09/colleges-biggest-greek-life-2013-14_n_3731846.html|title=Colleges Biggest on Greek Life According To Princeton Review 2013–14 Ranking |publisher=huffingtonpost.com |date= August 9, 2013|accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranked DePauw #3 in the nation for highest percentage of male students belonging to fraternities and #4 in the nation for highest percentage of female students in sororities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/2013/12/31/10-universities-with-the-most-students-in-fraternities |title=10 Universities With the Most Students in Fraternities  |publisher=usnews.com |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/most-sororities |title=Most Students in Sororities |publisher=usnews.com |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>

The Greek community consists of fourteen national social fraternities (eleven of which have houses on campus) and ten sororities (six of which have houses on campus).  DePauw has an extensive and substantial Greek history, with both [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], the first Greek-letter organization for women, and [[Alpha Chi Omega]] being founded at the school. The Lambda Chapter is the longest continuing chapter of [[Phi Gamma Delta]].

Formal IFC ([[North American Interfraternity Conference]]) recruitment for men and Panhel ([[National Panhellenic Conference]]) recruitment for women is held early second semester. Membership intake for [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] organizations (historically black Greek-lettered organizations) and Multicultural Greek organizations usually occurs in the fall and/or the spring.  First-year students are not permitted onto fraternity or sorority property for a period of time at the beginning of each school year.

Greek-letter organizations that formerly maintained chapters on DePauw's campus include the fraternities [[Delta Chi]], [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]], and [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], and the sororities [[Delta Zeta]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Alpha Omicron Pi]] and [[Alpha Gamma Delta]].

===Controversy===
{{main|DePauw University Delta Zeta controversy}}
In 2006, the national organization of the [[Delta Zeta]] sorority reorganized the DePauw chapter, reducing twenty-three of its thirty-five current members (including the chapter president) to alumna status and giving them six weeks to vacate the [[Fraternity and sorority houses|sorority house]]. Of the twelve remaining members, six chose to take alumna status. The Delta Zeta national organization explained that its decisions were based on member commitment, but the evicted members said that they were forced to take alumna status because the chapter members were perceived as physically unattractive and "brainy".<ref>{{cite news

Subsequently, on Monday, March 12, 2007, DePauw President Robert G. Bottoms announced that the university would sever its ties with Delta Zeta's national organization, effective at the end of the 2006–2007 academic year. President Bottoms was quoted as saying, "I came to the conclusion that our approaches to these issues are just incompatible."<ref>{{cite news

Every year since 1890, DePauw University has competed in [[American football]] against its rival [[Wabash College]] in what has become the [[Monon Bell]] Classic.  The traveling trophy, a 300-pound train bell from the [[Monon Railroad]], made its debut in the rivalry in 1932.  The DePauw-Wabash series is one of the nation's oldest [[college football]] rivalries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.wabash.edu/sports/2011/7/25/FB_0725114739.aspx|title=The Monon Bell Rivalry|website=Wabash College|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}</ref>

In 1933, head coach [[Ray Neal|Ray "Gaumey" Neal]] led the DePauw Tigers football team to an unbeaten, untied, and unscored opening season. The Tigers compiled a 7–0–0 record and outscored their opponents 136–0. Neal nearly duplicated this feat in 1943, but DePauw, 5–0–1, finished the season with one scoreless tie and six points allowed in a different game. The only points surrendered that season were in a 39–6 victory over [[Indiana State Sycamores football|Indiana State]] and the only non-win was a 0–0 tie against Oberlin. The Tigers outscored their opponents, 206–6.

DePauw had been a member of the [[Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference]] from 1997 to 2011, and won numerous conference championships, most notably in women's basketball, where the school is a Division III power.  DePauw's program had also won the conference's overall "President's Trophy" seven times in that span, including six consecutive President's Trophies from 2005 to 2006 to 2010–11.<ref name=Results>DEPAUW EXITS SCAC WITH SIXTH CONSECUTIVE PRESIDENTS TROPHY VICTORY, [http://www.scacsports.com/awardsHonors/presidents_trophy "DEPAUW EXITS SCAC WITH SIXTH CONSECUTIVE PRESIDENTS TROPHY VICTORY"], SCAC, retrieved October 14, 2008.</ref> In 2007, the Tigers defeated [[Washington University Bears#Women's Basketball|Washington University in St. Louis]] to win the Division III title in women's basketball.  The women's softball team won the regional title, advancing to the Division III College World Series for the first time in school history.

In 2012–2013, the women's basketball team won its second Division III National Championship with a 69 to 51 victory over the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater, in the title game in Holland, Michigan. The Tigers finished 34–0 on the season, which was the best basketball season at the Division III level for men's or women's basketball.

Over the years, DePauw has sent several players to the [[National Football League|NFL]], including Dave Finzer (1982), a punter for the [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Seattle Seahawks]], and Greg Werner (1989), a [[tight end]] for the [[New York Jets]].

==Traditions==

===Music===

The DePauw University School of Music presents regular recitals by students and faculty and concerts by visiting artists, most of which are free and open to the public.

DePauw students also organize concerts for the campus community.  Performers in recent years have included [[Dave Matthews]], [[Train (band)|Train]], [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Ben Folds]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Guster]].  Past guests have included [[Billy Joel]], [[Smokey Robinson and the Miracles]], [[The Carpenters]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], and [[Harry Chapin]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Society of Professional Journalists===
On May 6, 1909, Sigma Delta Chi was founded by a group of DePauw University student journalists.  The organization officially changed its name to the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] in 1988. Today it is the nation's most broad-based journalism organization, encouraging the free practice of journalism and stimulating high standards of ethical behavior. SPJ promotes the free flow of information vital to a well-informed citizenry; works to inspire and educate the next generation of journalists; and protects [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] guarantees of [[freedom of speech]] and press. In 2012, SPJ returned to the DePauw campus with the assistance of Eugene S. Pulliam Distinguished Visiting Professor of Journalism [[Mark Tatge]] "<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spjnetwork.org/president/tag/mark-tatge/|title=Freedom of the Prez " Mark Tatge – A Society of Professional Journalists Blog|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}</ref>

===Rector Scholarships===
Since 1919, the Rector Scholar Program has recognized DePauw students of exceptional scholarship and character. To be named a Rector Scholar is to join a prestigious tradition more than 4,000 graduates strong. Rector Scholarships are offered to the top academic applicants offered admission to DePauw. A limited number of full tuition Presidential Rector Scholarships are available.

===Ubben Lecture series===
Endowed by a gift from Timothy H. and Sharon (Williams) Ubben, both 1958 graduates of DePauw, the speakers' series "brings the world to Greencastle". Begun in 1986 and presented free of charge and open to all, Ubben Lecturers have included [[Malala Yousafzai]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[Benazir Bhutto]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Jane Goodall]], [[Tony Blair]], TV's [[Jimmy Kimmel]], [[Elie Wiesel]], [[Colin Powell]], [[Indianapolis Colts]] quarterback [[Andrew Luck]], [[Spike Lee]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

[[Brad Stevens]], head coach of the [[Boston Celtics]] and 1999 DePauw graduate, will speak on March 9, 2020. [[Condoleezza Rice]] visited campus October 8, 2019.

The Ubben Series has hosted 114 events in its 33-year history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/about/history-traditions/ubben-lecture-series/archives/|title=Past Ubben Lecturers - DePauw University}}</ref>

===Monon Bell Classic===
{{See also|Monon Bell#Monon Bell Classic|l1=Monon Bell Classic}}
Voted "Indiana's Best [[College athletics|College Sports]] Rivalry" by viewers of [[ESPN]] in 2005, DePauw University and [[Wabash College]] play each November—in the last regular season football game of the year for both teams—for the right to keep or reclaim the [[Monon Bell]].{{citation needed|date= October 2015}} The two teams first met in 1890.  In 1932, the Monon Railroad donated its approximately 300-pound locomotive bell to be offered as the prize to the winning team each year. Wabash leads the all-time series, 62–54–9; since the Monon Bell was introduced, Wabash leads 43–38–6.  The game routinely sells out (up to 11,000 seats, depending upon the venue and seating arrangement) and has been televised by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[ESPN2]], [[AXS TV]], and [[Fox Sports]] (where it has appeared for the past two years).  Each year, alumni from both schools gather at more than 60 locations around the United States for telecast parties, and a commemorative DVD (including historic clips known as "Monon Memories") is produced (there are discs of the 1977, 1984, 1993, 1994 and 2000–2018 games).

===Boulder Run===
[[File:Columbia Boulder, DePauw University.jpg|thumb|right|Boulder next to East College]]The Boulder Run has become a tradition at DePauw University. Students, [[streaking]] from their respective residences, run to and from the Columbia Boulder, located in the center of the campus near the East College building.  Students today perform the Boulder Run for a variety of reasons, though it was originally performed on the day or night of the first snowfall on campus by Phi Kappa Psi, the Greek house nearest the boulder. This tradition was mentioned in ''[[Playboy magazine]]'s'' September 1972 issue. The DePauw police are usually tolerant of the tradition, but students have been arrested when caught.{{citation needed | date= October 2015}}

===Campus Golf===
It is not unusual to see students playing a game of [[Campus Golf]] when the weather is nice.  The game of campus golf requires a [[golf club (equipment)|golf club]] and a [[tennis ball]].  Players attempt to hit their [[tennis ball]] against various targets on campus within a number of strokes. The game is similar to [[frisbee golf]], where players attempt to hit targets ranging from trees to buildings with a frisbee.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], DePauw University was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name="depauw-v-12">{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/library/archives/dpuinventories/Navy_V12.htm |title=Archives of DePauw University |publisher=[[Greencastle, Indiana]]: DePauw University |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916104814/http://www.depauw.edu/library/archives/dpuinventories/Navy_V12.htm |archive-date=September 16, 2006 }}</ref>
