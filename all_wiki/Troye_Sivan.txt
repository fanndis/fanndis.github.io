=== Music videos ===
Sivan's music videos frequently feature LGBTQ relationships between the characters. ''[[Blue Neighbourhood]]''{{'}}s trilogy followed the narrative of two gay teenagers in a secret relationship while "Youth" featured Sivan with another male love interest. His music video for "Heaven ft. Betty Who" features footage of historical LGBTQ movements and couples, as well as sensual shots with him and an anonymous man with the running tagline "Without losing a piece of me, how do I get to Heaven?" and "If I'm losing a piece of me, maybe I don't want Heaven". The singer says these portrayals are important to him, especially when he considers his younger life when he remembers "such vivid memories of the few times I saw any type of LGBTQ relationship on TV or in music videos".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kitchenerpost.ca/whatson-story/6955732-q-a-troye-sivan-on-coming-out-canadian-popstars/ |title=Q&A: Troye Sivan on coming out, Canadian popstars |last=Friend |first=David |date=9 November 2016 |work=Kitchener Post |accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref> On 16 July 2020, Sivan released a music video for his second song, "[[Easy (Troye Sivan song)|Easy]]", from his EP ''[[In a Dream (EP)|In a Dream]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Legaspi|first=Althea|last2=Legaspi|first2=Althea|date=17 July 2020|title=Troye Sivan's Heartbreak is Set Aflame in New 'Easy' Video|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/troye-sivan-easy-video-1030149/|access-date=17 July 2020|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> The video was directed by Sivan himself.{{citation needed|date = November 2020}}
