'''David Howell Evans''' (born 8 August 1961), better known by his stage name '''the Edge''' (or simply '''Edge'''),<ref name="m21">McCormick (2006), pp. 21, 23–24</ref> is a musician and songwriter best known as the lead guitarist, keyboardist, and backing vocalist of the [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. A member of the group since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with them as well as one solo record. The Edge's understated style of guitar playing, a signature of U2's music, is distinguished by chiming [[timbre]]s, use of rhythmic [[delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[drone (music)|drone]] notes, [[String harmonic|harmonics]], and an extensive use of [[effects unit]]s.

The Edge was born in England to a Welsh family, and was raised in Ireland after the Evans family moved there. In 1976, at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] he formed a band with his fellow students and elder brother [[Dik Evans|Dik]] that would evolve into U2. Inspired by the ethos of [[punk rock]] and its basic arrangements, the group began to write its own material. They eventually became one of the most successful acts in [[popular music]], with albums such as 1987's ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and 1991's ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. Over the years, the Edge has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his own style, including [[American roots music]], [[industrial music]], and [[alternative rock]]. With U2, the Edge has also played keyboards, co-produced their 1993 record ''[[Zooropa]]'', and occasionally served as co-lyricist. The Edge met his second wife [[Morleigh Steinberg]] through her collaborations with the band.

As a member of U2 and as an individual, the Edge has campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes. He co-founded [[Music Rising]], a charity to support musicians affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate [[Bono]] on several projects, including songs for [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Tina Turner]], and the soundtracks to the musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s London stage adaptation of ''[[A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music|A Clockwork Orange]]''. As a member of U2, the Edge has won 22 [[Grammy Award]]s and has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Several music publications have ranked the Edge among the greatest guitarists of all time.

==Early life==
David Howell Evans was born at the [[Barking, London|Barking]] Maternity Hospital,<ref>Dunphy (1988), p. 70</ref> in the county of [[Essex]] in [[England]], on 8 August 1961. He is the second child of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] parents Garvin and Gwenda Evans,<ref name="m21" /> both of whom originated from [[Llanelli]], a coastal town in [[South Wales]]. Garvin was an engineer who worked for the local electricity board, and subsequently worked for the electronics company [[Plessey]].<ref name="m21" /> The Edge has an elder brother [[Dik Evans|Richard]] (often called Dik) and a younger sister called Gillian.<ref name="m21" /> The Evanses initially lived in [[Chadwell Heath]], Essex. Around 1962, Garvin was offered a promotion and a transfer at his job, and the family subsequently moved to [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for him to take it.<ref name="m21" />

During his childhood in Dublin he possessed two differing [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s to converse in, [[Welsh English|Welsh]] and [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]], the former being used when he was in the family home and the latter when he was outside; as he later explained: "The reason for this dual identity was mainly to be understood by my peers but also to be accepted."<ref name="m21" />

He received his initial formal education at St. Andrew's National School, in [[Malahide]]. As a child, he also received piano and guitar lessons, and practised music with Dik. The Edge received his first guitar at the age of seven when his mother bought him a Spanish guitar. He did not know how to properly tune it or hold it and referred to it as "little more than a toy", but he was fascinated by how cool it was. At the age of nine, the "first proper guitar" came to the Evans household when the Edge's mother purchased an old acoustic guitar at a [[jumble sale]] for a pound. He and Dik both experimented with this instrument, replacing the rusty wire strings with nylon ones and learning to properly play it.<ref name="m21" /> The Edge said in 1982 of this early experimentation, "me and my elder brother Dik both played it, plonking away, all very rudimentary stuff, open chords and all that."<ref name="u2mag-1982">{{cite magazine|title=On the Edge of Success |magazine=U2 Magazine|first=Tom|last=Nolan |issue=3 |date=May 1982}}</ref>

==Musical career==
===U2===
{{Main|U2}}
[[File:The Edge in Belfast, Nov 19 2015.jpg|thumb|The Edge performing at a [[U2]] concert in Belfast in 2015]]
While the Evans brothers were at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] in Dublin in 1976, they went along to a meeting in response to an advert posted by another pupil, [[Larry Mullen Jr.]], on the school's noticeboard seeking musicians to form a new band with him. Among the several other pupils who also responded to the note were [[Bono|Paul "Bono" Hewson]] and [[Adam Clayton]].<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 27–30</ref> The band went through a number of reformations before becoming known as [[U2]] in March 1978 (Richard Evans having left before this to join another band, leaving his younger brother as the lead guitarist).<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 46–48</ref>

Early in the band's career, Evans was given the nickname "the Edge" by members of the Lypton Village surrealist [[street gang]] to which Bono belonged. The nickname is commonly believed to be derived from the angular shape of Evans' head.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 68</ref><ref>McGee (2008), p. 9</ref> However, the origin of the name is disputed and other theories include a description of his guitar playing and his preference for not becoming fully involved and therefore remaining on the edge of things.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.threechordsandthetruth.net/u2bios/u2edgebio.php|title=Biography of U2's guitarist, The Edge| website= threechordsandthetruth.net|access-date= 2018-03-24}}</ref>

U2 began its public performance life in small venues in Dublin in 1977, occasionally playing at other venues elsewhere in Ireland. In December 1979, they performed their first concerts outside Ireland, in [[London]], and in 1980 began extensive touring across the [[British Isles]], developing a following. Their debut album ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'' was released in 1980.

In 1981, leading up to the [[October Tour]], Evans came very close to leaving U2 for religious reasons, but he decided to stay.<ref name="m117">McCormick (2006), pp. 117–120</ref> During this period he became involved with a group called Shalom Tigers, in which bandmates [[Bono]] and Larry Mullen Jr. were also involved.<ref name="edge-bio">{{cite web |url= http://www.atu2.com/band/edge/ |title=The Edge biography (@U2) |accessdate=9 September 2007}}</ref> Shortly after deciding to remain with the band, he wrote a piece of music that later became "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]".<ref name="m117" />

===Other musical pursuits===
[[File:The Edge 360 Tour Foxboro 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|The Edge performing in 2009]]
In addition to his regular role within U2, the Edge has also recorded with such artists as [[Johnny Cash]], [[B. B. King]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Jah Wobble]], [[Holger Czukay]], [[Jay-Z]], and [[Rihanna]]. The Edge connected with [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] collaborator [[Michael Brook]] (the creator of the [[infinite guitar]], which he regularly uses), working with him on the [[Captive (soundtrack)|score to the film ''Captive'']] (1986). From this soundtrack the song "Heroine", the vocal of which was sung by a young [[Sinéad O'Connor]] was released as a single.

He also created the theme song for season one and two of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. He and fellow U2 member Bono wrote the theme of the 1995 [[James Bond]] film ''[[GoldenEye]]''. The Edge, along with Bono, composed a [[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark|musical adaptation]] of [[Spider-Man]]. On 25 May 2011, a single titled "[[Rise Above 1]]" by Reeve Carney featuring Bono and the Edge was released digitally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/rise-above-1-20110526|title=Rise Above 1 by Reeve Carney feat.

In 2008, the Edge participated in the [[Davis Guggenheim]]-directed documentary film ''[[It Might Get Loud]]''. The film examines the history of the electric guitar, focusing on the careers and styles of the Edge, [[Jimmy Page]], and [[Jack White]]. The film premiered on 5 September 2008 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]

On 29 April 2016, the Edge performed in the [[Sistine Chapel]] as part of a conference for the Angiogenesis Foundation, making him the first rock artist to stage a concert at the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/the-edge-becomes-first-rock-star-to-play-the-sistine-chapel-a7011056.html|title=The Edge becomes first rock star to play the Sistine Chapel|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Jess|last=Denham|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>

{{Quote box
 | quote  = "Notes actually ''do'' mean something. They have power. I think of notes as being expensive. You don't just throw them around. I find the ones that do the best job and that's what I use. I suppose I'm a minimalist instinctively. I don't like to be inefficient if I can get away with it. Like on the end of '[[With or Without You]]'. My instinct was to go with something very simple. Everyone else said, "Nah, you can't do that." I won the argument and I still think it's sort of brave, because the end of 'With or Without You' could have been so much bigger, so much more of a climax, but there's this power to it which I think is even more potent because it's held back... ultimately I'm interested in music. I'm a musician. I'm not a gunslinger. That's the difference between what I do and what a lot of ''guitar heroes'' do."

He said by focusing "on one area of the [[Fingerboard|fretboard]] [he] was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way".<ref name="u2mag-1982"/> Other equipment choices contribute to the Edge's unique sound. His 1964 [[Vox AC30]] "Top Boost" amplifier (housed in a 1970s cabinet) is favoured for its "sparkle" tone, and is the basis for his sound both in the studio and live.<ref name="musicradar-360"/> The Edge has also used [[Guitar pick|plectrums]] manufactured by the German company Herdim that he turns sideways or upside down so the dimpled grip strums against the strings, resulting in a "rasping top end" to his guitar tone.<ref name="edgeofu2"/>

About his playing style, the Edge said in 1982:
{{quote|"I like a nice ringing sound on guitar, and most of my chords I find two strings and make them ring the same note, so it's almost like a 12-string sound. So for E I might play a B, E, E and B and make it ring. It works very well with the Gibson Explorer.}}

=== Vocals ===
[[File:U2 in Sydney (49121288753).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|The Edge singing backing vocals into a headset microphone in 2019]]
The Edge provides the backing vocals for U2. Their 1983 live album and video release, ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' and ''[[U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' are good reference points for his singing (as are the live DVDs from the [[Elevation Tour]], ''[[U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle]]'' and ''[[Elevation 2001: Live from Boston]]''). For example, he sings the chorus to "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]" (Bono harmonises on the final 'Sunday'). U2 used this tradeoff technique later in "[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]" as well. His backing vocals are sometimes in the form of a repeated cry; examples of songs that use this approach include "[[Beautiful Day (song)|Beautiful Day]]", "[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]" and "[[Stay (Faraway, So Close!)]]". Another technique he uses in his backing vocals is the falsetto, in songs such as "[[Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of]]", "[[Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own]]", "A Man and a Woman", "The Wanderer", live versions of "[[The Fly (song)|The Fly]]", and "[[Window in the Skies]]".

The Edge sings the lead vocal on "[[Van Diemen's Land (song)|Van Diemen's Land]]" and "[[Numb (U2 song)|Numb]]", the first half of the song "Seconds", dual vocals with Bono in "Discotheque", and the bridge in the song "[[Miracle Drug]]".<ref name="edge-bio"/> He also sings the occasional lead vocal in live renditions of other songs (such as "Sunday Bloody Sunday" during the [[PopMart Tour]] and "Party Girl" during the Rotterdam Zoo TV show when it was Bono's birthday),<ref>[http://www.u2-vertigo-tour.com/show355.html] {{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref> and has sung the second verse of the "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]" cover on a few shows. A solo acoustic version of the song "[[Love is Blindness]]", that is featured in the documentary film ''[[From the Sky Down]]'', is sung by him as well.

=== Other instruments ===
He has played keyboards on many of the band's songs, including "I Fall Down", "[[October (song)|October]]", "[[So Cruel]]", "[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]", "[[Running to Stand Still]]", "[[Miss Sarajevo]]", "The Hands that Built America", and "[[Original of the Species]]" and others. In live versions of "New Year's Day", "[[The Unforgettable Fire (song)|The Unforgettable Fire]]", "[[Your Blue Room]]", "[[Moment of Surrender]]" and "Raised By Wolves", he plays both the piano and guitar parts alternately. In most live versions of "Original of the Species," piano is the only instrument played during the song. Although the Edge is the band's lead guitarist, he occasionally plays bass guitar, including the live performances of the song [[40 (song)|"40"]] where the Edge and bassist [[Adam Clayton]] switch instruments.

===Equipment===

==Personal life==
Evans was brought up as a [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]],<ref>{{Cite news|date=7 May 2016|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/u2s-the-edge-being-protestant-in-an-ostensibly-catholic-country-it-felt-strange-34692060.html|title=U2's The Edge: 'Being Protestant in an ostensibly Catholic country... it felt strange'|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]}}</ref> and was, along with fellow band members Bono and Mullen, involved with non-denominational Christian group the Shalom Fellowship as an adult.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/church-u2|title=The Church of U2|first=Joshua|last=Rothman|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=14 November 2020}}</ref>

Evans married his secondary school girlfriend Aislinn O'Sullivan on 12 July 1983.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 144</ref> They have three daughters: Hollie (born in 1984), Arran (in 1985) and 'Blue Angel' (in 1989).<ref name="edge-bio" /> The couple separated in 1990, but were unable to get legally divorced because of Irish laws regarding marriage [[annulment]] at the time; divorce was [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|legalised in 1995]], and the couple legally divided in 1996.<ref name="edge-bio" />

In 1993, he began dating [[Morleigh Steinberg]], an American professional dancer who was employed by the band as a choreographer and on-stage [[belly dancer]] during the [[Zoo TV Tour]]. They have a daughter, Sian (born 1997), and a son, Levi (born 25 October 1999). The couple were married in 2002.<ref name="edge-bio" />

Evans has been criticised for his efforts to build five luxury mansions on a 156-acre (63.13-hectare) plot of land in [[Malibu, California]].<ref name="u2-plans">{{Cite news |date=18 June 2011

The [[Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy]] agreed to remain neutral on the issue following a US$1 million donation from Evans and a commitment to designate 100 acres of the land as open space for public footpaths.<ref name="u2-plans"/>

===Philanthropy===
[[File:The Edge with Steve Censky and Dr William W Li at USDA HQ 6-19-2018.jpeg|thumb|The Edge with [[United States Deputy Secretary of Agriculture|US Deputy Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Stephen Censky]] and Angiogenesis Foundation co-founder Dr. William W. Li]]
The Edge, [[Bob Ezrin]] and [[Henry Juszkiewicz]] co-founded [[Music Rising]] in 2005, a charity that helped provide replacement instruments for those that were lost in [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The instruments were originally only replaced for professional musicians but they soon realised the community churches and schools needed instruments as well. The charity's slogan is "Rebuilding the Gulf Region note by note" and has so far helped over a hundred musicians who were affected by Hurricane Katrina. The Edge also serves on the board of [[the Angiogenesis Foundation]], a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organisation dedicated to improving global health by advancing [[angiogenesis]]-based medicine, diets, and lifestyle.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Angiogenesis Foundation: People |url=http://www.angio.org/about-people-bod.php |accessdate=7 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226070613/http://www.angio.org/about-people-bod.php |archivedate=26 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/06/20/u2s-the-edge-talks-up-food-as-an-anti-cancer-weapon/|title=U2's The Edge talks up food as an anti-cancer weapon|work=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Laurie|last=McGinley|date=20 June 2017|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>
