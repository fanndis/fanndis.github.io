The discovery of [[Siniša Mali plagiarism scandal|plagiarism]] in Mali's doctoral dissertation was one of the triggers for the [[Serbian protests (2018–present)|anti-government protests]] leading to the 12-day students' blockade of the university's main building and the decision of the [[University of Belgrade]] to revoke his doctorate.

==Early life and education==
Siniša Mali was born on 25 August 1972, in [[Belgrade]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.istinomer.rs/akter/3/Sinisa-Mali?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgdix9uDB4gIV1uR3Ch0FEgqpEAAYASAAEgJfA_D_BwE|title=Siniša Mali|website=istinomer.rs|access-date=9 July 2019}}</ref> He graduated from the primary and secondary school – the 5th Belgrade Grammar School.

==Business career==
Prior to his political career, Mali was a [[financial adviser]] in the [[private sector]]. He worked in several private companies that were engaged in advising in the field of [[financial services]]. Between 1995 and 1997, Mali worked for [[Deloitte]] &Touche in [[Belgrade]], and in its [[Prague]] office from 1999 to 2001. During his stay in the United States, he worked at [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] in the Mergers & Acquisitions Group in New York City.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web|url=https://www.srbija.gov.rs/biografija/en/33966/sinisa-mali.php|title=Sinisa Mali|last=srbija.gov.rs|website=srbija.gov.rs|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref>

In 2001, he was appointed as the Assistant Minister of Privatisation in the Ministry of Economy and Privatisation. During his tenure, Mali was in charge of the execution of the [[Privatization|privatisation]] process in the Republic of Serbia and preparation of the various laws in this field. At the end of that year, he moved to the Privatisation Agency, where he was the director of the Centre for Tender Privatisation. He remained in that position until the end of 2003.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

From 2005 to 2008, Mali was the chairman of the real estate company "NCA Investment Group Doo Beograd".<ref name="A.V.M">{{Cite web|url=https://www.blic.rs/vesti/beograd/ko-je-sinisa-mali-od-najboljeg-studenta-do-gradonacelnika/vylzmz6|title=Ko je Siniša Mali: Od najboljeg studenta do gradonačelnika|last=A.V.M|website=Blic.rs|language=sr|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref>

Mali's private business was being investigated by the Serbian Administration for the Prevention of Money Laundering (APML) in 2016. Earlier, during 2015, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Serbian investigative journalism outlet KRIK discovered that Mali controls 42 bank accounts, registered under himself, his wife, and his three underage children. These accounts were holding sums of money far exceeding his official salary. In addition, OCCRP/KRIK discovered and reported his purchase of 24 apartments on Bulgarian Black Sea coast in 2012 and 2013. APML suspected Mali's accounts and apartment purchases as a money-laundering scheme and reported it to the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office in Belgrade. The prosecutors dismissed the case, as they did not find evidence of criminal activity and therefore rejected to launch an investigation.<ref>[https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/7694-the-mayor-of-belgrade-s-multiplying-bank-accounts The Mayor of Belgrade’s Multiplying Bank Accounts by S.
