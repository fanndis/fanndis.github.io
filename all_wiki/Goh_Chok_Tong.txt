'''Goh Chok Tong''' (born 20 May 1941) is a former Singaporean politician who served as the 2nd [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] from 28 November 1990 to 12 August 2004. 

Goh was appointed as the next [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] after [[Lee Kuan Yew]] stepped down from position which Lee had held from 5 June 1959 to 28 November 1990 for 31 years. He is the only living former [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] and holds the [[Title of honor|honorary title]] of "Emeritus Senior Minister".

He served as the 2nd [[Secretary-General of the People's Action Party]] from November 1992 to December 2004 after 1st Secretary-General [[Lee Kuan Yew]] stepped down from position. He subsequently served as [[Senior Minister]] and Chairman of the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]] (MAS) from 2004 to 2011.<ref name="monetaryauthoritychairmen">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mas.gov.sg/who-we-are/Our-History|title=Our History|website=www.mas.gov.sg|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=14 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200914180420/https://www.mas.gov.sg/who-we-are/Our-History|url-status=live}}</ref> On 25 June 2020, it was announced that Goh would retire from politics and step down as the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) after 44 years. He will not contest in the [[2020 Singaporean general election]], signalling the renewal of the leadership of the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/ge2020-goh-chok-tong-retire-politics-after-44-years-mp|title=GE2020: Goh Chok Tong to retire from politics after 44 years as MP|first=Joyce|last=Lim|date=25 June 2020|access-date=25 June 2020|archive-date=26 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200626105141/https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/ge2020-goh-chok-tong-retire-politics-after-44-years-mp|url-status=live}}</ref> He was a [[Member of Parliament]] for 44 years, representing [[Marine Parade Single Member Constituency|Marine Parade SMC]] for 12 years and another 32 years after it was absorbed into [[Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency|Marine Parade GRC]].

==Early life==
Goh was born in Singapore on 20 May 1941 to Goh Kah Choon and Quah Kwee Hwa, who hailed from the [[Minnan region]] of [[Fujian|Fujian province]] in China. He has Chinese [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] ancestry.<ref>[http://www.fjdx.gov.cn/fjnj/contents/Y1998/qwgz.hrst.htm 闽籍华侨华人社团] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222080405/http://www.fjdx.gov.cn/fjnj/contents/Y1998/qwgz.hrst.htm |date=22 December 2015 }}</ref> Goh studied at [[Raffles Institution]] from 1955 to 1960. He was a very competitive swimmer in his younger days and was given the nickname "Bold".

Goh earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] with first class honours in [[economics]] from the [[National University of Singapore|University of Singapore]] and a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[development economics]] from [[Williams College]] in 1967. After his studies, Goh returned to Singapore to work in the government.<ref name="Mauzy">Mauzy, Diane K. and R.S. Milne (2002). ''Singapore Politics Under the People's Action Party''. Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-24653-9}}</ref> Goh's dream of getting a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] was disrupted as the government would not transfer his bursary bond to the university, where he had signed on as a research fellow after graduation. In 2015, Goh was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]] by his [[alma mater]], the National University of Singapore, for his contributions to the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/nus-confers-honorary-degrees-on-esm-goh-prof-saw-and-sir-richard-sykes|title=NUS confers honorary degrees on ESM Goh, Prof Saw and Sir Richard Sykes|last=hermesauto|date=6 July 2015|website=The Straits Times|access-date=2 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706103851/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/nus-confers-honorary-degrees-on-esm-goh-prof-saw-and-sir-richard-sykes|archive-date=6 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Career at Neptune Orient Lines, 1969–1977 ==
In 1969, Goh was seconded to the national shipping company [[Neptune Orient Lines]] (NOL) as the company's Planning and Projects Manager. His career advanced quickly and by 1973 he was the Managing Director. At NOL, Goh worked under the company's founder, [[Muhammad Jalaluddin Sayeed]], with whom he maintained close ties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/weekly/cowas/20050925.htm|title=Sayeed of Singapore, By Ardeshir Cowasjee, Dawn newspaper, 25 September 2005|access-date=7 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305110515/http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/weekly/cowas/20050925.htm|archive-date=5 March 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Early political career==
In the [[1976 Singapore general election|1976 general election]], Goh, then 35, was elected as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Marine Parade Single Member Constituency]] as a [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) candidate. He was appointed as a [[Minister of State|Senior Minister of State]] for Finance. In 1981, he was promoted to [[Minister for Trade and Industry (Singapore)|Minister for Trade and Industry]] and later served in other appointments including [[Minister for Health (Singapore)|Minister for Health]] and [[Minister for Defence (Singapore)|Minister for Defence]].<ref>[http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/smgoh.htm Goh Chok Tong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222193426/http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/smgoh.htm |date=22 December 2005 }}, Cabinet of Singapore</ref>

In 1985, Goh became the first [[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]] and began to assume the responsibility of the government in a carefully managed leadership transition. According to [[Lee Kuan Yew]], his preferred successor was [[Tony Tan Keng Yam|Tony Tan]]. However, Goh was selected by the second generation of PAP leaders that included Tony Tan, [[Suppiah Dhanabalan]] and [[Ong Teng Cheong]]; Lee accepted their decision.<ref name="Mauzy"/>

== Prime Minister, 1990–2004 ==
[[File:SingaporeUS FreeTrade.jpg|thumb|208px|Goh and U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] signing the [[US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement]] in the [[White House]], 6 May 2003.]]  
On 28 November 1990, Goh succeeded [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and became the second Prime Minister of Singapore. Lee remained an influential member of Goh's [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]], holding the post of [[Senior Minister]]. The 1991 general elections, the first electoral test for Goh, led to the party winning 61% of the popular vote. In 1992, Lee handed over the post of Secretary-General of the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) to Goh, successfully completing the leadership transition.

As Prime Minister, Goh promised a more open-minded and consultative style of leadership than that of his predecessor. This greater openness extended also to the socio-economic spheres of life, for instance, in his support for the rise of "little bohemias" in Singapore, enclaves where more creativity and entrepreneurship could thrive.<ref>Quoted in "Singapore can become an entrepreneurial society" by Eugene Low, The Business Times, 19 August 2002, and analysed in ''Brand Singapore: How Nation Branding Built Asia's Leading Global City'' by [[Koh Buck Song]], Marshall Cavendish 2011, page 160.</ref>

Goh's administration introduced several major policies and policy institutions, including:

* [[Central Provident Fund|Medisave]]
* [[Non-Constituency Member of Parliament|Non-Constituency Members of Parliament]]
* [[Government Parliamentary Committees]]
* [[Group representation constituency]]
* [[Nominated Member of Parliament|Nominated Members of Parliament]]
* [[Certificate of Entitlement|Vehicle Quota Scheme]]
* [[Presidential elections in Singapore|Elected President]]
* [[Singapore 21]]

During the period under Goh's administration, Singapore experienced several crises, such as the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], threats of terrorism including the 2001 [[Singapore embassies attack plot]] by [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], the 2001–2003 economic recession, and the [[Timeline of the SARS outbreak|2003 SARS outbreak]].

As Secretary-General, Goh led the PAP to three general election victories in 1991, 1997, and 2001, in which the party won 61%, 65% and 75% of the votes respectively. After the [[2001 Singapore general election|2001 general election]], Goh indicated that he would step down as Prime Minister after leading the country out of the recession.<ref name="Mauzy"/>

During an interview with [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] in July 2003, Goh surprised Singaporeans by announcing that his government was openly employing homosexuals, even in sensitive jobs, despite homosexual acts remaining illegal under [[Section 377A of the Penal Code (Singapore)|Section 377A of the Penal Code]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Singapore letting gays halfway out of the closet - smh.com.au|url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/04/1057179159336.html?oneclick=true|website = www.smh.com.au|accessdate = 2015-12-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090210200338/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/04/1057179159336.html?oneclick=true|archive-date = 10 February 2009|url-status = live|date = 5 July 2003}}</ref> Although his announcement drew a strong backlash from conservatives, it nevertheless reinforced his image as an open-minded leader.

The banner behind him shows the campaign manifesto of the [[People's Action Party]], "Staying Together, Moving Ahead".]]

On 12 August 2004, Goh stepped down as Prime Minister and held a new position as [[Senior Minister]] in the [[First Lee Hsien Loong Cabinet|Cabinet]] of his successor, [[Lee Hsien Loong]]. On 20 August 2004, Goh assumed the position of Chairman of the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]].<ref name="heritage.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/InternationalOrganizations/wm1177.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026175331/http://www.heritage.org/Research/InternationalOrganizations/wm1177.cfm |archivedate=26 October 2006}}</ref> After a number of threats of terrorism in Singapore,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Goh met local Islamic religious leaders in 2004 and made a visit to Iran, where he met Iranian president [[Mohammad Khatami]] and visited local mosques.

Goh subsequently visited other Middle Eastern countries as Senior Minister, with a view to improving diplomatic relationships and thus gaining wider opportunities for Singaporean businesses, especially in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On 1 February 2005, Goh was appointed an honorary Companion of the [[Order of Australia]], Australia's highest civilian honour, "for eminent service to Australia-Singapore relations".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-21592|title=Transcript 21592 - PM Transcripts|website=pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au|access-date=2 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411054906/http://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-21592|archive-date=11 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 19 May 2005, Goh signed a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement with Israel's Finance Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] on a visit to Israel, superseding the agreement signed in 1971. Improvements in the agreement include enhancements to the withholding tax rate on interest income, which was reduced from 15% to 7%. This would benefit Singaporean businessmen with investments in Israel and vice versa, by ensuring they are not taxed twice.

Goh is a patron for the [[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|Institute of Policy Studies]], a government [[think tank]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In the [[2006 Singaporean general election|2006 general election]], Goh was tasked to help the PAP win back the two opposition wards of [[Hougang Single Member Constituency|Hougang]] and [[Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency|Potong Pasir]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/198700/1/.html | title=SM Goh to help PAP candidates win back Hougang, Potong Pasir seats  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321235428/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/198700/1/.html | archivedate=21 March 2006}}</ref> However, he was unsuccessful in this task, as [[Low Thia Khiang]] and [[Chiam See Tong]] retained their respective wards.

In 2006, Goh was briefly considered for the job of [[United Nations Secretary-General]]<ref name="unsg-candidates">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/candidates.html|title=''Candidates for UN Secretary General''|publisher=UNSG.org|access-date=2007-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211051217/http://www.unsg.org/candidates.html|archive-date=2007-12-11|url-status=live}}</ref> but he lost out and the job eventually went to [[Ban Ki-moon]].<ref name="heritage.org"/>

In 2008, Goh was invited to join the [[InterAction Council of Former Heads of State and Government]], an independent international organisation of former world leaders.

On 24 January 2011, Goh announced that he would continue to seek re-election to Parliament at the [[2011 Singaporean general election|2011 general election]]. Over the following months, he progressively released snippets prior to the election on the importance of grooming a successor who could be part of the fourth generation PAP leadership to helm Marine Parade GRC in the long run.

== Emeritus Senior Minister ==
After the [[2011 Singaporean general election|2011 general election]] in which the opposition made unprecedented gains by winning a [[Group representation constituency|group representative constituency]] in ([[Aljunied Group Representative Constituency|Aljunied]]), Goh and [[Lee Kuan Yew]] announced that they were retiring from the [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]] in order to give Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and the rest of his team a clean slate from which they can make a fresh start in the new parliamentary term.<ref>{{Cite news|title=SM Goh, MM Lee to leave Cabinet|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1128878/1/.html|newspaper=Channel NewsAsia|location=Singapore|date =14 May 2011|access-date=14 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515061344/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1128878/1/.html|archive-date=15 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 18 May 2011, Lee Hsien Loong announced that Goh was to be appointed a senior adviser to the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]], and would be given the honorary title of "Emeritus Senior Minister".<ref>{{Cite news|title= PM Lee announces sweeping changes to Cabinet|url= http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1129632/1/.html|newspaper= Channel NewsAsia|location= Singapore|date= 18 May 2011|access-date= 28 May 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110528113127/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1129632/1/.html|archive-date= 28 May 2011|url-status= live}}</ref>

On 24 June 2011, Goh was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] by the Japanese government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Goh Chok Tong to receive award from Japanese emperor|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1135932/1/.html|publisher=ChannelNewsAsia|accessdate=19 June 2011|archive-date=23 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023021527/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1135932/1/.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 4 May 2012, Goh was appointed as Patron for Advancement of the [[Singapore University of Technology and Design]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ESM Goh appointed Patron for Advancement of SUTD|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1199294/1/.html|publisher=ChannelNewsAsia|accessdate=19 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505154442/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1199294/1/.html|archive-date=5 May 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 2014, the [[Madame Tussauds]] Singapore museum unveiled a wax figure of Goh. At its opening, Goh posed for pictures with his statue.<ref>{{cite news|title=PM Lee, ESM Goh to have wax figures at Madame Tussauds Singapore|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/pm-lee-esm-goh-have-wax-figures-madame-tussauds-singapor#sthash.Y1tdrffE.dpuf|accessdate=27 October 2014|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=22 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027065010/http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/pm-lee-esm-goh-have-wax-figures-madame-tussauds-singapor#sthash.Y1tdrffE.dpuf#sthash.Y1tdrffE.dpuf|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 2 August 2018, Goh stated that ministerial pay is not enough and it will adversely impact the ability to attract competent people to join the government in the future. He also dismissed the idea of reducing the minister's salary as a populist move, a move that sparked controversy and public disapproval.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/esm-goh-ministers-not-paid-enough-harder-to-attract-people-to-government-in-the-future|title=ESM Goh: Ministers not paid enough; harder to attract people to government in the future|last=hermesauto|date=7 August 2018|website=The Straits Times|access-date=8 August 2018|archive-date=8 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808073355/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/esm-goh-ministers-not-paid-enough-harder-to-attract-people-to-government-in-the-future|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/goh-chok-tong-salary-not-starting-point-in-looking-for-ministers-10597576|title='Salaries is not our starting point in looking for ministers': Goh Chok Tong responds to criticism of comments on pay|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809090848/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/goh-chok-tong-salary-not-starting-point-in-looking-for-ministers-10597576|archive-date=9 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In an interview in 2019, Goh stated that he believed a 75% to 80% majority in Parliament, in the future, would constitute a 'strong mandate' for the Singapore government. In the same interview, he noted that he does not believe the electoral system needed any further tweaking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-must-have-strong-ruling-party-with-clear-majority-esm-goh|title=Singapore must have strong ruling party with clear majority: Goh Chok Tong|last=hermes|date=2019-05-27|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-date=28 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528120100/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-must-have-strong-ruling-party-with-clear-majority-esm-goh|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 4 August 2019, Goh made a [[Facebook]] post stating that he felt saddened by how his long-time friend, former PAP politician [[Tan Cheng Bock]], had "lost his way" by forming a new political party, [[Progress Singapore Party]] (PSP), to contest in the next general election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/it-saddens-me-to-see-how-tan-cheng-bock-has-lost-his-way-esm-goh-11780298|title='It saddens me to see how Tan Cheng Bock has lost his way': ESM Goh|date=4 August 2019|accessdate=5 August 2019|agency=Channel Newsasia|archive-date=4 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190804165223/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/it-saddens-me-to-see-how-tan-cheng-bock-has-lost-his-way-esm-goh-11780298|url-status=live}}</ref>
