'''Aberdeen City Council''' represents the [[Aberdeen City]] [[Council areas of Scotland|council area]] of [[Scotland]].

The [[council area]] was created in 1996, under the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]]. However, a sense of Aberdeen as a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], with its own city council, can be traced back to 1900, when the [[Counties of Scotland|county of the city]] of Aberdeen was created.

In 1975, under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], counties of cities were abolished. The area of the former county of a city was combined with [[Bucksburn]], [[Dyce]], Newhills, Old Machar, [[Peterculter]] and the Stoneywood areas of the [[county of Aberdeen]], and the [[Nigg, Aberdeen|Nigg]] area of the [[county of Kincardine]], (including [[Cove Bay]]) to form the Aberdeen district of the [[Grampian]] [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]]. This district became the now existing [[unitary council area]] in 1996.

On 9 May 1995, by resolution under section 23 of the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], the City of Aberdeen Council changed the name of the local government area of "City of Aberdeen" to "Aberdeen City".<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2011/443/pdfs/ssi_20110443_en.pdf#3 Scottish Statutory Instrument 2011 No. 443]</ref>

==Composition==
[[File:Aberdeen City Council Chamber 2015 1.JPG|thumb|Aberdeen City Council Chamber]]
Between 2003 and 2007, the council was under the control of a [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] and [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party|Conservative]] coalition, holding 23 of the 43 seats on the council. Prior to the 2003 election, the council had been considered a [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] stronghold.<ref>{{cite news|first=Scott|last=David|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1443312002|title=Labour is set to lose council strongholds in elections|work=The Scotsman|date=2002-12-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109233442/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1443312002|archivedate=9 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Following the [[2007 Aberdeen City Council election|May 2007 election]], contested for the first time using a system of [[proportional representation]], the Liberal Democrats and [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) formed a coalition to run the council, holding 27 of the 43 seats (following an SNP by election gain from the Conservatives on 16 August 2007, the coalition held 28 of the 43 seats). Two Liberal Democrat councillors became [[Independent (politics)|independents]] during this period due to personal controversies, while the Conservative group split in August 2010, with two councillors forming the Independent Alliance Group.

After the [[2012 Aberdeen City Council election|May 2012 election]], the control of the council shifted back to the Labour Party, supported in a coalition by three Conservative and three Independent councillors, giving the administration 23 seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-18003121|title=Labour-Conservative administration to run Aberdeen City Council|work=BBC News|date=2012-05-09}}</ref>

The Labour/Conservative/Independent coalition continued after the [[2017 Aberdeen City Council election|2017 election]], but with a change in the balance of power within the coalition. Labour were reduced to nine councillors (subsequently suspended from membership by the Scottish Labour Party for forming a coalition with the Conservatives), whilst the Conservatives had eleven councillors elected.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-39940006|title=Labour councillors in Aberdeen suspended over Tory coalition|date=2017-05-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-GB}}</ref> These Conservative and suspended "Aberdeen Labour" councillors were joined in coalition by three Independent councillors, one of who had left the Liberal Democrats just days after the council election.

Aberdeen City Council comprises 45 councillors, who represent the city's [[ward (politics)|wards]], and is headed by the [[List of Provosts and Lord Provosts of Aberdeen|Lord Provost]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-39959841|title=Aberdeen Provost says Labour coalition row will be resolved|date=2017-05-18|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-GB}}</ref> The Council has Co-Leaders as a result of the coalition agreement. Douglas Lumsden and Jenny Laing are the current Co-Leaders.<ref name=":0" />

==Council Structure==
Before May 2007, councillors represented 43 single-member wards election on a [[first-past-the-post]] basis.

On 5 May 2007, the [[single transferable vote]] system was used for the first time and multi-member [[ward (politics)|ward]]s were introduced, each ward electing three or four councillors. The [[Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland]] completed its final recommendations for new wards for all the [[council areas of Scotland]].

Aberdeen is divided into 13 multi-member wards, electing a total of 45 councillors. This system was introduced as a result of the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], and is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/your-area/scotelections2007.cfm |title=Scottish elections 2007 |publisher=The Electoral Commission |accessdate=2007-02-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127122545/http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/your-area/scotelections2007.cfm |archivedate=27 January 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>
