Powell served as the 16th [[United States National Security Advisor]] from 1987 to 1989 and as the 12th [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] from 1989 to 1993.

Powell was born in [[New York City]] in 1937 and was raised in the [[South Bronx]]. His parents, Luther and Maud Powell, immigrated to the United States from [[Jamaica]]. Powell was educated in the New York City public schools, graduating from the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), where he earned a bachelor's degree in geology. He also participated in [[ROTC]] at CCNY and received a commission as an Army second lieutenant upon graduation in June 1958. Powell was a professional soldier for 35 years, during which time he held many command and staff positions and rose to the rank of four-star general. He was Commander of the [[United States Army Forces Command|U.S. Army Forces Command]] in 1989.

His last assignment, from October 1989 to September 1993, was as the 12th Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the highest military position in the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. During this time, he oversaw 28 crises, including the invasion of Panama in 1989 and [[Operation Desert Storm]] in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] against Iraq in 1990–1991.  He formulated the [[Powell Doctrine]] which limits American military action unless it satisfies criteria regarding American national security interests, overwhelming force, and widespread public support.<ref>LaFeber, 2009.</ref> He was the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States#Secretaries of State|65th]] [[United States Secretary of State]], serving under Republican President [[Presidency of George W.

''Political Science Quarterly'' 124.1 (2009) p. 71.</ref>

In retirement, Powell wrote his autobiography, ''My American Journey''. He pursued a career as a public speaker, addressing audiences across the country and abroad. Prior to his appointment as Secretary of State, Powell was the chairman of [[Americas Promise|America's Promise]] – The Alliance for Youth, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to mobilizing people from every sector of American life to build the character and competence of young people. Powell is the recipient of numerous U.S. and foreign military awards and decorations. Powell's civilian awards include the [[Presidential Medals of Freedom|Presidential Medal of Freedom]] (twice), the President's [[Citizens Medal]], the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], the [[Secretary's Distinguished Service Award|Secretary of State Distinguished Service Medal]], and the Secretary of Energy Distinguished Service Medal. Several schools and other institutions have been named in his honor and he holds honorary degrees from universities and colleges across the country. {{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} In 2016, while not a candidate for [[2016 United States presidential election|that year's election]], Powell [[Faithless electors in the United States presidential election, 2016|received three electoral votes]] for the office of [[President of the United States]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/21/colin-powell-places-third-presidential-race-electo/|title=Colin Powell places third in presidential race at Electoral College|last=Richardson|first=Valerie|date=December 21, 2016|website=Washington Times}}</ref>

==Military career==
Powell was a professional soldier for 35 years, holding a variety of command and staff positions and rising to the rank of [[General (United States)|general]].<ref name=BiographyChannel>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9445708&page=print|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070807232535/http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9445708&page=print|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 7, 2007|accessdate=May 31, 2007|title=Colin (Luther) Powell Biography (1937– )|work=The Biography Channel|publisher=A&E Television Networks|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Training===
Powell described joining the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) during college as one of the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had "found himself." According to Powell: <blockquote>It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on.<ref>{{cite web|title= Colin Powell Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/general-colin-l-powell/#interview}}</ref> </blockquote>[[Officer cadet|Cadet]] Powell joined the [[Pershing Rifles]], the ROTC fraternal organization and [[Military Drill Team|drill team]] begun by General [[John Pershing]]. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.

Upon graduation, he received a commission as an [[United States Army|Army]] [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|second lieutenant]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Secretary of State Colin L.

===Vietnam War===
In his autobiography, Powell said he is haunted by the nightmare of the [[Vietnam War]] and felt that the leadership was very ineffective.

[[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] Powell served a tour in Vietnam as a [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese Army]] (ARVN) advisor from 1962 to 1963. While on patrol in a [[Viet Cong]]-held area, he was wounded by stepping on a [[punji stake]].<ref name=Kearny_p179>{{Cite book|author-link=Cresson Kearny|author=Kearny, Cresson H.|title=Jungle Snafus...And Remedies|publisher=Oregon Institute of Science & Medicine |location=Cave Junction, Oregon|year=1996 |isbn=978-1-884067-10-5 |oclc=41447083|page= 179}}</ref> The large infection made it difficult for him to walk, and caused his foot to swell for a short time, shortening his first tour.

Powell returned to Vietnam as a [[Major (United States)|major]] in 1968, serving as assistant [[Chief of staff (military)|chief of staff]] of operations for the [[23rd Infantry Division (United States)|23rd (Americal) Infantry Division]]. During the second tour in Vietnam he was decorated with the [[Soldier's Medal]] for bravery after he survived a helicopter crash and single-handedly rescued three others, including division commander Major General [[Charles M. Gettys]], from the burning wreckage.<ref name="CNN1996" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Finlayson |first=Reggie |title=Colin Powell |series=Biography (A & E) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaYOC27mmhAC&q=Charles+M.+Gettys+colin+powell&pg=PA55 |accessdate=7 December 2012 |year=2003 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |isbn=9780822549666 |page=55 }}</ref>

Powell was charged with investigating a detailed letter by [[11th Light Infantry Brigade]] soldier Tom Glen, which backed up rumored allegations of the [[My Lai Massacre]]. He wrote: "In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between American soldiers and the [[Vietnamese people]] are excellent." Later, Powell's assessment would be described as [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewashing]] the news of the massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public. In May 2004, Powell said to television and radio host [[Larry King]], "I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. I got there after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored."<ref>{{cite web  |title = Interview on CNN's Larry King Live  |publisher=U.S. Department of State |location=New York  |date=May 4, 2004  |url = https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/32160.htm  |accessdate =February 3, 2007 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> }}</ref>

===After the Vietnam War===
[[File:Nixon Contact Sheet WHPO-E0416 Colin Powell.jpg|thumb|left|Richard Nixon and Powell, 1973]]
Powell served a [[White House Fellows]]hip under President [[Richard Nixon]] from 1972 to 1973. During 1975–1976 he attended the [[National War College]], Washington, D.C.<ref name=BrownWagner>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Warren|last2=Wagner|first2=Heather Lehr|title=Colin Powell: Soldier and Statesman|date=1 Jan 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=41,43}}</ref>

In his autobiography, ''My American Journey'', Powell named several officers he served under who inspired and mentored him. As a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] serving in South Korea, Powell was very close to General [[Henry "Gunfighter" Emerson]]. Powell said he regarded Emerson as one of the most caring officers he ever met. Emerson insisted his troops train at night to fight a possible North Korean attack, and made them repeatedly watch the television film ''[[Brian's Song]]'' to promote racial harmony. Powell always professed that what set Emerson apart was his great love of his soldiers and concern for their welfare. After a [[race riot]] occurred, in which [[African American]] soldiers almost killed a white officer, Powell was charged by Emerson to crack down on [[Black Power|black militants]]; Powell's efforts led to the discharge of one soldier, and other efforts to reduce racial tensions.<ref name="CNN1996" /> During 1976–1977 he commanded the 2nd Brigade of the [[101st Airborne Division]].<ref name="CNN staff"/>

===A "political general"===
In the early 1980s, Powell served at [[Fort Carson, Colorado]]. After he left Fort Carson, Powell became senior military assistant to Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]], whom he assisted during the [[Invasion of Grenada|1983 invasion of Grenada]] and the [[1986 Bombing of Libya|1986 airstrike on Libya]].

[[File:President Ronald Reagan and Colin Powell.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Ronald Reagan]] and National Security Advisor Powell in 1988]]
In 1986, Powell took over the command of [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] in Frankfurt, Germany, from [[Robert Lewis "Sam" Wetzel]]. The next year, he served as [[United States Deputy National Security Advisor]], under [[Frank Carlucci]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bamford |first=James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/18/magazine/carlucci-and-the-nsc.html |title=Carlucci and the N.S.C. |date=January 18, 1987 |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 25, 2020 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Following the [[Iran–Contra affair|Iran–Contra]] scandal, Powell became, at the age of 49, [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], serving from 1987 to 1989 while retaining his Army commission as a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]].

In April 1989, after his tenure with the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], Powell was promoted to four-star [[General (United States)|general]] under President [[George H. W. Bush]] and briefly served as the [[Commanding General, United States Army Forces Command|Commander in Chief]], [[United States Army Forces Command|Forces Command]] (FORSCOM), headquartered at [[Fort McPherson, Georgia]], overseeing all Army, Army Reserve, and [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] units in the Continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and [[Puerto Rico]]. He became the third general since World War II to reach four-star rank without ever serving as a division commander, joining [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Alexander Haig]].

Later that year, President George H. W. Bush selected him as Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/inauguration/transition/powell.html |title=Online NewsHour: Colin Powell |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

===Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===
[[File:GEN Colin Powell.JPG|thumb|upright|Powell in November 1989, in his official Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff portrait.]]

Powell's last military assignment, from October 1, 1989, to September 30, 1993, was as the 12th [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the highest military position in the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. At age 52, he became the youngest officer, and first [[Afro-Caribbean American]], to serve in this position. Powell was also the first JCS Chair who received his commission through [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]].<ref>{{Cite news  | title = The 14 Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  | agency=American Forces Press Service|publisher=Joint History Office, U.S. Department of Defense  | date = August 10, 1999  | url = http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=43048  |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}</ref>

During this time, he oversaw responses to 28 crises, including the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] in 1989 to remove General [[Manuel Noriega]] from power and [[Operation Desert Storm]] in the 1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. During these events, Powell earned his nickname, "the reluctant warrior." He rarely advocated military intervention as the first solution to an [[international crisis]], and instead usually prescribed diplomacy and [[containment]].

As a [[military strategist]], Powell advocated an approach to military conflicts that maximizes the potential for success and minimizes casualties. A component of this approach is the use of overwhelming force, which he applied to Operation Desert Storm in 1991. His approach has been dubbed the "[[Powell Doctrine]]." Powell continued as chairman of the JCS into the [[Clinton Administration|Clinton presidency]] but as a dedicated "[[Realism in international relations|realist]]" he considered himself a bad fit for an administration largely made up of [[Liberal internationalism|liberal internationalists]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Colin Powell: A Political Biography | last = O'Sullivan | first = Christopher | author-link = Christopher D O'Sullivan | publisher = Rowman & Littlefield Publishers | year = 2010 | page = [https://archive.org/details/colinpowellpolit0000osul/page/100 100] | isbn = 978-0-7425-5187-9 | location = Lanham, Maryland | url = https://archive.org/details/colinpowellpolit0000osul/page/100 }}</ref> He clashed with then-[[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|U.S. ambassador to the United Nations]] [[Madeleine Albright]] over the [[Bosnian war|Bosnian crisis]], as he opposed any military interventions that didn't involve US interests.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/30/usa.afghanistan "Reluctant warrior"], ''[[The Observer]]'', September 30, 2001.</ref>

# It ain't as bad as you think.
# Get mad, then get over it.
# Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.
# It can be done.
# Be careful what you choose. You may get it.
# Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.
# You can't make someone else's choices.
# Check small things.
# Share credit.
# Remain calm. Be kind.
# Have a vision.
# Don't take counsel of your fears or naysayers.
# Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.

Powell's experience in military matters made him a very popular figure with both American political parties. Many [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] admired his moderate stance on military matters, while many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past Republican administrations.

In 1997, Powell founded [[America's Promise]] with the objective of helping children from all [[socioeconomic]] sectors. That same year saw the establishment of The Colin L. Powell Center for Leadership and Service.  The mission of the Center is to "prepare new generations of publicly engaged leaders from populations previously underrepresented in public service and policy circles, to build a strong culture of civic engagement at City College, and to mobilize campus resources to meet pressing community needs and serve the public good." <ref>{{cite web|title=Colin L.

Powell was mentioned as a potential candidate in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 U.S. presidential election]], but again decided against running.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/how-mccain-does-it-156687?tid=relatedcl|title=How Mccain Does It|date=2000-03-06|access-date=2016-08-12}}</ref> Once Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]] secured the Republican nomination, Powell endorsed him for president and spoke at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]]. Bush won the general election and appointed Powell as Secretary of State.

In the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] vote count of [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Powell received three votes for President from [[faithless elector]]s from [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

==Secretary of State (2001–2005)==

[[File:Condoleezza Rice Colin Powell George W. Bush Donald Rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|Powell, National Security Advisor [[Condoleezza Rice]] and Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] listen to President [[George W. Bush]] speak.]]
As [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in the Bush administration, Powell was perceived as moderate. Powell was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate]]. Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S. Secretary of State in 30 years.
<ref name=WashingtonPost_Kessler_20040714 >{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48010-2004Jul13.html|title=Powell Flies in the Face of Tradition; The Secretary of State Is Least Traveled in 30 Years |author=Kessler, Glenn|date=July 14, 2004| page=A01|work=Washington Post}}</ref>

On September 11, 2001, Powell was in [[Lima]], Peru, meeting with President [[Alejandro Toledo]] and [[US Ambassador]] John Hamilton, and attending the special session of the [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|OAS General Assembly]] that subsequently adopted the [[Inter-American Democratic Charter]]. After the [[September 11 attacks]], Powell's job became of critical importance in managing America's relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the [[War on Terrorism]].

Powell came under fire for his role in [[Rationale for the Iraq War|building the case]] for the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. In a press statement on February 24, 2001, he had said that [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against Iraq had prevented the development of any [[weapons of mass destruction]] by [[Saddam Hussein]]. As was the case in the days leading up to the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of Saddam, preferring to continue a policy of containment. However, Powell eventually agreed to go along with the Bush administration's determination to remove Saddam. He had often clashed with others in the administration, who were reportedly planning an Iraq invasion even before the September 11 attacks, an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] in front of the [[9/11 Commission]]. The main concession Powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the Iraq War was the involvement of the international community in the invasion, as opposed to a [[Unilateralism|unilateral approach]]. He was also successful in persuading Bush to take the case of Iraq to the United Nations, and in moderating other initiatives. Powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign.

[[File:Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg|thumb|Powell holding a [[2001 anthrax attack|model vial of anthrax]] while giving a presentation to the [[United Nations Security Council]] in February 2003.]]

Powell's chief role was to [[The UN Security Council and the Iraq war|garner international support]] for a multi-national [[coalition]] to mount the invasion. To this end, Powell [[United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War#Colin Powell's presentation|addressed a plenary session]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] on February 5, 2003, to argue in favor of military action. Citing numerous anonymous Iraqi defectors, Powell asserted that "there can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more." Powell also stated that there was "no doubt in my mind" that Saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons.<ref name=UNSC_Powell_20030205>{{cite web  |title = Remarks to the United Nations Security Council  |publisher=U.S. Department of State  |first=Secretary Colin L. |last=Powell  |location=New York City  |date=February 5, 2003  |url = https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2003/17300.htm  |accessdate =February 3, 2007  <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> }}</ref>

Most observers praised Powell's oratorical skills. However, Britain's ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' reported soon afterwards that a [[Iraq Dossier|UK intelligence dossier]] that Powell had referred to as a "fine paper" during his presentation had been based on old material and [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] an essay by American graduate student [[Ibrahim al-Marashi]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/529|title=U.S. Scholar Uncredited in Iraq Report|last=Lawless|first=Jill|date=February 7, 2003|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}</ref><ref name=CNN_20030207>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/07/sprj.irq.uk.dossier/index.html|publisher=CNN|title= UK accused of lifting dossier text|date=February 7, 2003}}</ref>
A 2004 report by the [[Iraq Survey Group]] concluded that the evidence that Powell offered to support the allegation that the Iraqi government possessed [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) was inaccurate.

In an interview with Charlie Rose, Powell contended that prior to his UN presentation, he had merely four days to review the data concerning WMD in Iraq.<ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/654,11/17/2005 Charlie Rose]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. charlierose.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.</ref>

A Senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in Powell's speech. State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the [[yellowcake forgery]].<ref name=LAT_Miller_20040715>{{Cite news  |last = Miller  |first = Greg  |title = Flaws Cited in Powell's U.N.

Powell later recounted how Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, "You've got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points." Powell's longtime [[aide-de-camp]] and Chief of Staff from 1989–2003, Colonel [[Lawrence Wilkerson]], later characterized Cheney's view of Powell's mission as to "go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two. Fall on your damn sword and kill yourself, and I'll be happy, too."<ref name=DeYoung2006>{{Cite news  |last = DeYoung  |first = Karen  |title = Falling on His Sword: Colin Powell's most significant moment turned out to be his lowest  |work=Washington Post  |date = October 1, 2006  |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700106.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref>

In September 2005, Powell was asked about the speech during an interview with [[Barbara Walters]] and responded that it was a "blot" on his record. He went on to say, "It will always be a part of my record. It was painful. It's painful now."<ref name=ABC_20050908>{{Cite news  |title = Colin Powell on Iraq, Race, and Hurricane Relief  |work=ABC News: 20/20  |date = September 8, 2005  |url = https://abcnews.go.com/2020/Politics/story?id=1105979&page=1  |accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref>

Wilkerson said that he inadvertently participated in a hoax on the American people in preparing Powell's erroneous testimony before the United Nations Security Council.<ref name=PBS_Brancaccio_20060203>{{Cite news  |last = Brancaccio  |first = David  |title = Iraq Pre-War Intelligence  |work=[[NOW (PBS)|NOW]]  |publisher=PBS  |date = February 3, 2006  |url = https://www.pbs.org/now/politics/wilkerson.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref>

Because Powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration, he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion, such as [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]]. At times, infighting among the Powell-led State Department, the Rumsfeld-led Defense Department, and Cheney's office had the effect of polarizing the administration on crucial issues, such as what actions to take regarding [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].

After [[Saddam Hussein]] had been deposed, Powell's new role was to once again establish a working international coalition, this time to assist in the rebuilding of post-war Iraq. On September 13, 2004, Powell testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,<ref name=WashingtonPost_Pincus_20040914>{{Cite news  |last = Pincus  |first = Walter  |title = Support for Intelligence Plan  |work=Washington Post  |date = February 14, 2004  |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18890-2004Sep13.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref> acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his February 2003 UN presentation were "wrong" and that it was "unlikely" that any stockpiles of WMDs would be found. Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, Powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community, including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that "what one person knew, everyone else knew."

Additionally, Powell has been critical of other aspects of [[U.S. foreign policy]] in the past, such as its support for the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]]. From two separate interviews in 2003, Powell stated in one about the 1973 event "I can't justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time. It was a different time. There was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world. Communism was a threat to the [[democracy|democracies]] in this part of the world. It was a threat to the United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/news/2003/02/dos022003.html |title=Remarks at the 2003 Groundhog Job Shadow Day Program, Secretary Colin L.

In November the president "forced Powell to resign," says [[Walter LaFeber]].<ref>Walter LaFeber, "The rise and fall of Colin Powell and the Powell Doctrine." ''Political Science Quarterly'' 124.1 (2009) p. 71.</ref> Powell announced his resignation as Secretary of State on November 15, 2004. shortly after Bush was reelected. He had been asked to resign by the president's chief of staff, [[Andrew Card]].<ref name=DeYoung2006/> Powell announced that he would stay on until the end of Bush's first term or until his replacement's confirmation by Congress. The following day, Bush nominated National Security Advisor [[Condoleezza Rice]] as Powell's successor. News of Powell's expulsion spurred mixed reactions from politicians around the world&nbsp;— some upset at the loss of a statesman seen as a moderating factor within the Bush administration, but others hoping for Powell's successor to wield more influence within the cabinet.

In mid-November, Powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that [[Iran]] was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system.<ref name=NYT_Sciolino_20041118>{{Cite news  |last = Sciolino  |first = Elaine  |title = Exiles Add to Claims on Iran Nuclear Arms  |work = New York Times  |date = November 18, 2004  |url = http://www.nci.org/04nci/11/pbs/ExilesAdd.htm  |accessdate = February 8, 2007  |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070102013832/http://www.nci.org/04nci/11/pbs/ExilesAdd.htm  |archive-date = January 2, 2007  |url-status = dead  |df = mdy-all  }}</ref> The accusation came at the same time as the settlement of an agreement between Iran, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], and the European Union.

On December 31, 2004, Powell rang in the New Year by pressing a button in [[Times Square]] with [[New York City Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] to initiate the [[Times Square Ball|ball drop]] and 60 second countdown, ushering in the year 2005. He appeared on the networks that were broadcasting New Year's Eve specials and talked about this honor, as well as being a native of New York City.<ref name=CNN_Anderson_20041231>{{Cite news  |last = Anderson  |first = Cooper  |title = Transcripts: ''New Year's Eve Special''  |publisher=CNN  |date = December 31, 2004  |url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0412/31/se.01.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref>

Although biographer Jeffrey J. Matthews is highly critical of how Powell misled the United Nations Security Council regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, he credits Powell with a series of achievements at the State Department. These include restoration of morale to a psychologically demoralized professional diplomats, leadership of the international HIV/AIDs initiative, resolving a crisis with China, and blocking efforts to tie Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the United States.<ref>Jeffrey J. Matthews, ''Colin Powell: Imperfect Patriot'' (U of Notre Dame Press, 2019) pp. 321, 379-85.</ref>

==Life after diplomatic service==
After retiring from the role of Secretary of State, Powell returned to private life. In April 2005, he was privately telephoned by Republican senators [[Lincoln Chafee]] and [[Chuck Hagel]],<ref name=WashingtonPost_VandeHei_20050422>{{Cite news|author1=VandeHei, Jim  |author2=Robin Wright|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7420-2005Apr21.html|title=Powell Playing Quiet Role in Bolton Battle|work=Washington Post|date=April 22, 2005}}</ref> at which time Powell expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of [[John R. Bolton]] as ambassador to the United Nations, but refrained from advising the senators to oppose Bolton (Powell had clashed with Bolton during Bush's first term).<ref name=Guardian_Borger_20050423>{{Cite news  |last = Borger  |first = Julian  |title = Powell's remarks harm Bolton's chances of UN job  |work=The Guardian |location=London  |date = April 23, 2005  |url = https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1468438,00.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref> The decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to Bolton's chances of confirmation. Bolton was put into the position via a [[recess appointment]] because of the strong opposition in the Senate.

[[File:Ki-moon Powell.jpg|thumb|left|Powell with [[Ban Ki-moon]], 2004.]]
On April 28, 2005, an opinion piece in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by [[Sidney Blumenthal]] (a former top aide to President [[Bill Clinton]]) claimed that Powell was in fact "conducting a campaign" against Bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together, which among other things had resulted in Powell cutting Bolton out of talks with Iran and [[Libya]] after complaints about Bolton's involvement from the British. Blumenthal added that "The foreign relations committee has discovered that Bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to 10 intercepts by the [[National Security Agency]]. Staff members on the committee believe that Bolton was probably spying on Powell, his senior advisors and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that Bolton opposed."<ref name=Guardian_Blumenthal_20050428>{{Cite news  |last = Blumenthal  |first = Sidney  |title = The good soldier's revenge  |work=The Guardian |location=London |date = April 28, 2005  |url = https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1471879,00.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref>

In July 2005, Powell joined [[Kleiner Perkins]], a well-known [[Silicon Valley]] [[venture capital]] firm, with the title of "strategic limited partner."

In September 2005, Powell criticized the response to [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=BBC_20050909>{{Cite news  |title = Powell criticises storm response  |work=BBC News  |date = September 9, 2005  |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4229238.stm  }}</ref> Powell said that thousands of people were not properly protected, but because they were poor rather than because they were black.

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the [[White House]] of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. In September 2006, Powell sided with more moderate Senate Republicans in supporting more rights for detainees and opposing President Bush's terrorism bill. He backed Senators [[John Warner]], [[John McCain]] and [[Lindsey Graham]] in their statement that U.S. military and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the U.S. in the name of fighting terrorism. Powell stated that "The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of [America's] fight against terrorism."<ref name=BBC_20060915>{{Cite news  |title = Senators defy Bush on tribunals  |work=BBC News  |date = September 15, 2006  |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5347564.stm  |accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref>

Also in 2006, Powell began appearing as a speaker at a series of motivational events called ''Get Motivated'', along with former New York Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]]. In his speeches for the tour, he openly criticized the Bush Administration on a number of issues. Powell has been the recipient of mild criticism for his role with ''Get Motivated'' which has been called a "get-rich-quick-without-much-effort, feel-good schemology."<ref name=AmericanSatellite_Wilken_20080907>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansatellite.org/2008/08/down-rabbit-hole.html|accessdate=October 10, 2008|title=Down the Rabbit Hole|author=Wilken, Dennis|date=September 7, 2008|work=American Satellite Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031200227/http://www.americansatellite.org/2008/08/down-rabbit-hole.html|archive-date=October 31, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2008, Powell encouraged young people to continue to use new technologies to their advantage in the future. In a speech at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] to a room of young professionals, he said, "That's your generation...a generation that is hard-wired digital, a generation that understands the power of the information revolution and how it is transforming the world. A generation that you represent, and you're coming together to share; to debate; to decide; to connect with each other."<ref name=CSIS_20080708>{{cite web|accessdate=October 20, 2008|url=http://www.csis.org/component/option,com_csis_events/task,view/id,1721/|work=CSIS Launch of Next America|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|title=Keynote Address&nbsp;– A New Vision for America's Future: Young Leaders Shaping an International Agenda|author=Powell, General Colin L, USA (Ret.)|date=July 8, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731221202/http://www.csis.org/component/option%2Ccom_csis_events/task%2Cview/id%2C1721/|archive-date=July 31, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> At this event, he encouraged the next generation to involve themselves politically on the upcoming Next America Project, which uses online debate to provide policy recommendations for the upcoming administration.

In 2008, Powell served as a spokesperson for [[National Mentoring Month]], a campaign held each January to recruit volunteer mentors for at-risk youth.<ref name=mentor2008>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/chc/wmy2008/Celebrities/colin_powell.html|title=Who Mentored Colin Powell?|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|year=2008}}</ref>

Soon after [[Barack Obama]]'s [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], Powell began being mentioned as a possible [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]] member.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2008/11/11/al-gore-colin-powell-caroline-kennedy-in-obamas-administration.html |title=Al Gore, Colin Powell, Caroline Kennedy in Obama's Administration? – Washington Whispers |publisher=usnews.com |date=November 11, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> He was not nominated.

Powell was also instrumental in the 1993 implementation of the military's [[don't ask, don't tell]] policy,<ref name="issues"/> though he later supported its repeal as proposed by [[Robert Gates]] and Admiral [[Mike Mullen]] in January 2010, saying "circumstances had changed."<ref>{{cite news |title=Colin Powell shifts stance on 'don't ask, don't tell' policy |author=DeYoung, Karen |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2010 |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/03/AR2010020302292.html}}</ref>

The Vietnam War had a profound effect on Powell's views of the proper use of military force. These views are described in detail in the autobiography ''My American Journey''. The [[Powell Doctrine]], as the views became known, was a central component of U.S. policy in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] (the first U.S. war in Iraq) and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] (the overthrow of the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Afghanistan]] following the [[September 11 attacks]]). The hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation, and the use of overwhelming military force.

Powell gained attention in 2004 when, in a conversation with [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]], he reportedly referred to [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] within the Bush administration as "fucking crazies."<ref name=Guardian_Blumenthal_20041118>{{Cite news  |last = Blumenthal  |first = Sidney  |title = Colin and the crazies  |work=The Guardian |location=London |date = November 18, 2004  |url = https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1353796,00.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007}}</ref> In addition to being reported in the press (although the expletive was generally censored in the U.S. press), the quotation was used by British journalist [[James Naughtie]] in his book, ''The Accidental American: Tony Blair and the Presidency'', and by former Hong Kong governor [[Chris Patten]] in his book, ''Cousins and Strangers: America, Britain, and Europe in a New Century''.

In a September 2006 letter to Sen. [[John McCain]], General Powell expressed opposition to President Bush's push for [[Guantanamo military commission|military tribunals]] of those formerly and currently classified as [[enemy combatants]]. Specifically, he objected to the effort in Congress to "redefine Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention." He also asserted: "The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism."<ref>"Sen. McCain Releases Letter from Gen. Colin Powell", ''Washington Post'' (September 14, 2006). https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/09/14/GR2006091400728.html</ref>

===Justifying the Iraq War===
While Powell was wary of a military solution, he supported the decision to invade Iraq after the Bush administration concluded that diplomatic efforts had failed. After his departure from the State Department, Powell repeatedly emphasized his continued support for American involvement in the [[Iraq War]].

At the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado,<ref>See [http://www.aifestival.org/ Official website: Aspen Ideas Festival ]</ref> Powell revealed that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to President Bush "the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers." During this discussion, he insisted that the U.S. appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: "I also had to say to him that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aifestival.org/library/transcript/Powell-Lehrer_transcript.pdf|title=Conversation with Colin Powell|publisher=Aspen Ideas Festival|date=July 2007|accessdate=February 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227081751/http://www.aifestival.org/library/transcript/Powell-Lehrer_transcript.pdf|archive-date=February 27, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In a 2008 interview on [[CNN]], Powell reiterated his support for the 2003 decision to [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invade Iraq]] in the context of his endorsement of [[Barack Obama]], stating: "My role has been very, very straightforward. I wanted to avoid a war. The president [Bush] agreed with me. We tried to do that. We couldn't get it through the U.N. and when the president made the decision, I supported that decision. And I've never blinked from that. I've never said I didn't support a decision to go to war."<ref name="edition.cnn.com">"Powell: Support for Obama doesn't mean Iraq war wrong", CNN (October 19, 2008). http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/19/powell.transcript/</ref>

Powell's position on the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] has been less consistent. In December 2006, he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the U.S. military had enough troops to carry it out successfully. He stated: "I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work."<ref>James M. Klatell, "Powell: We Are Losing In Iraq", CBS (December 17, 2006). http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/17/ftn/main2274583.shtml</ref> Following his endorsement of Barack Obama in October 2008, however, Powell praised [[David Petraeus|General David Petraeus]] and U.S. troops, as well as the Iraqi government, concluding that "it's starting to turn around."<ref name="edition.cnn.com"/> By mid-2009, he had concluded a surge of U.S. forces in Iraq should have come sooner, perhaps in late 2003.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2009420450_apuspowell.html "Powell says Iraq surge should have come earlier"], ''Seattle Times'' (July 5, 2009)</ref> Throughout this period, Powell consistently argued that Iraqi political progress was essential, not just military force.

===Role in presidential election of 2008===
Powell donated the maximum allowable amount to [[John McCain]]'s campaign in the summer of 2007<ref name=CNN_Henry_20070809>{{Cite news  |last = Henry  |first = Ed |title = Powell donates to McCain  |publisher=CNN  |date = August 9, 2007  |url = http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/08/09/powell-donates-to-mccain/  |accessdate=August 9, 2007}}</ref> and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible [[running mate]] for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 U.S. presidential election]].<ref name=Reuters_Holland_20080305>{{cite news |accessdate=April 14, 2008

McCain won the Republican presidential nomination, but the Democrats nominated the first black candidate, Senator [[Barack Obama]] of Illinois. On October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Obama during a ''[[Meet the Press]]'' interview, citing "his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities", in addition to his "style and substance." He additionally referred to Obama as a "[[transformational figure]]."<ref name=obamaendorse/><ref name=transcript/> Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing [[Sarah Palin]] as the vice presidential candidate, stating that despite the fact that she is admired, "now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president." He said that Obama's choice for vice-president, [[Joe Biden]], was ready to be president. He also added that he was "troubled" by the "false intimations that Obama was Muslim." Powell stated that "[Obama] is a Christian—he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America." Powell then mentioned [[Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan]], a [[List of North American Muslims|Muslim American]] soldier in the [[U.S. Army]] who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, "Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me."<ref name=obamaendorse>{{Cite news  |title = Powell endorses Obama for president; Republican ex-Secretary of State calls Democrat 'transformational figure'  |work=Meet the Press  |publisher=NBC News and NBC News  |date = October 19, 2008  |url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27265369  |accessdate=October 19, 2008}}</ref><ref name=transcript>{{Cite news  |title =Meet the Press' transcript for October&nbsp;19, 2008  |publisher=NBC News  |date = October 19, 2008  |url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27266223  |accessdate =October 19, 2008}}</ref> Powell concluded his [[Sunday morning talk show]] comments, "It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen.

When asked why he is still a Republican on ''Meet the Press'' he said, "I'm still a Republican. And I think the Republican Party needs me more than the Democratic Party needs me. And you can be a Republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration, and improving our education system, and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country. I don't think there's anything inconsistent with this." <ref>{{cite web

===Views on the Obama administration===
In a July 2009 [[CNN]] interview with [[John King (journalist)|John King]], Powell expressed concern over President Obama growing the size of the federal government and the size of the federal budget deficit.<ref name=WashTimes>{{cite news | title = Powell airs doubts on Obama agenda | date = July 3, 2009 | accessdate =September 17, 2010 |work=The Washington Times | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/03/powell-airs-doubts-on-obama-agenda/}}</ref> In September 2010, he criticized the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] for not focusing "like a razor blade" on the economy and job creation. Powell reiterated that Obama was a "transformational figure."<ref>Carrie Budoff Brown, "Colin Powell critical of President Obama", ''Politico'' (September 19, 2010). http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42381.html</ref> In a video that aired on CNN.com in November 2011, Colin Powell said in reference to Barack Obama, "many of his decisions have been quite sound.

On October 25, 2012, 12 days before the [[2012 United States presidential election|presidential election]], he gave his endorsement to President Obama for re-election during a broadcast of ''[[CBS This Morning]]''. He cited success and forward progress in foreign and domestic policy arenas under the Obama administration. As additional reason for his endorsement, Powell cited the changing positions and perceived lack of thoughtfulness of [[Mitt Romney]] on foreign affairs, and a concern for the validity of Romney's economic plans.<ref name="endorses Obama 2012">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama-for-president/|title=Colin Powell endorses Barack Obama for president|publisher=CBS News|date=October 25, 2012|accessdate=August 18, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027201908/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57539893/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama-for-president/|archive-date=October 27, 2012}}</ref>

In an interview with ABC's [[Diane Sawyer]] and [[George Stephanopoulos]] during ABC's coverage of President Obama's second inauguration, Powell criticized members of the Republican Party who "demonize[d] the president." He called on GOP leaders to publicly denounce such talk.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC News|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/01/colin-powell-slams-idiot-presentations-by-some-republicans-urges-gop-leaders-to-speak-out-2/|accessdate=2013-01-22}}</ref>

===2016 presidential election===
Powell has been very vocal on the state of the Republican Party. Speaking at a Washington Ideas forum in early October 2015, he warned the audience that the Republican Party had begun a move to the fringe right, lessening the chances of a Republican White House in the future. He also remarked on Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]]'s statements regarding immigrants, noting that there were many immigrants working in Trump hotels.<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/news/colin-powell-slams-donald-trumps-immigration-plan-163454530.html.

In March 2016, Powell denounced the "nastiness" of the [[2016 Republican primaries]] during an interview on CBS ''This Morning''. He compared the race to [[reality television]], and stated that the campaign had gone "into the mud."<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colin-powell-gop-race_us_56dda980e4b0000de405301a Colin Powell: The GOP Race Has 'Gone Into The Mud'.

In August 2016, Powell accused the [[Hillary Clinton]] campaign of trying to pin her [[Hillary Clinton's email controversy|email controversy]] on him. Speaking to [[People (magazine)|''People'']] magazine, Powell said, "The truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did."<ref>http://www.people.com/article/colin-powell-hillary-clinton-pinning-email-scandal-on-him Colin Powell Says Hillary Clinton's 'People Have Been Trying to Pin' Email Scandal on Him. People Magazine. August 21, 2016. Retrieved September 14, 2016.</ref>

On September 13, 2016, emails were obtained that revealed Powell's private communications regarding both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Powell privately reiterated his comments regarding Clinton's email scandal, writing, "I have told Hillary's minions repeatedly that they are making a mistake trying to drag me in, yet they still try," and complaining that "Hillary's mafia keeps trying to suck me into it" in another email.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/09/13/colin-powell-hacked-emails/90341788/|title=Colin Powell calls Trump 'national disgrace' in hacked emails}}</ref> In another email discussing Clinton's controversy, Powell said she should have told everyone what she did "two years ago", and said that she has not "been covering herself with glory." Writing on the [[2012 Benghazi attack]] controversy surrounding Clinton, Powell said to then U.S. Ambassador [[Susan Rice]], "Benghazi is a stupid witch hunt." Commenting on Clinton in a general sense, Powell mused that "Everything [Clinton] touches she kind of screws up with hubris", and in another email stated "I would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colin-powell-hillary-clinton_us_57d96524e4b09d7a6880bf1c|title=Colin Powell Attacked Hillary Clinton's 'Hubris' In Leaked Emails|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=September 14, 2016|first=Paul|last=Blumenthal}}</ref>

Powell referred to Donald Trump as a "national disgrace", with "no sense of shame." He wrote of Trump's role in the [[birther]] movement, which he referred to as "racist." Powell suggested that the media ignore Trump, saying, "To go on and call him an idiot just emboldens him." The emails were obtained by the media as the result of a hack.<ref>{{cite news|last=Blake|first=Aaron|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/14/here-are-the-juiciest-colin-powell-comments-about-trump-and-clinton-from-his-leaked-emails/|title=Here are the juiciest Colin Powell comments about Trump and Clinton from his hacked emails|work=The Washington Post|date=September 14, 2016|access-date=June 7, 2020}}</ref>

===Views on the Trump administration===
In an interview in October 2019, Powell warned that the GOP needed to “get a grip" and put the country before their party, standing up to President Trump rather than worrying about political fallout. “When they see things that are not right, they need to say something about it because our foreign policy is in shambles right now, in my humble judgment, and I see things happening that are hard to understand,” Powell said.<ref>Yahoo News, "Colin Powell: Republicans Terrified Of Speaking Out Need To 'Get A Grip'", October 6, 2019 [https://www.yahoo.com/news/colin-powell-republicans-terrified-of-speaking-out-need-to-get-a-grip-195747765.html]</ref> On June 7, 2020, Powell announced he would be voting for former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] in the 2020 presidential election.<ref name="CNN20200607">{{cite news|last=Cole|first=Devan|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/07/politics/colin-powell-biden-trump-2020-cnntv/index.html|title=Colin Powell says he will vote for Joe Biden for president|work=CNN|date=June 7, 2020|access-date=June 7, 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Coat of Arms of Colin Powell.svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms]]
* The coat of arms of Colin Powell was granted by the [[Lord Lyon]] in Edinburgh on February 4, 2004. Technically the grant was to Powell's father (a British subject) to be passed on by descent. Scotland's [[King of Arms]] is traditionally responsible for granting arms to Commonwealth citizens of Scottish descent. Blazoned as

<blockquote>Azure, two swords in saltire points downwards between four mullets Argent, on a chief of the Second a lion passant Gules. On a wreath of the Liveries is set for Crest the head of an American bald-headed eagle erased Proper. And in an escrol over the same this motto, "DEVOTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE."</blockquote>

The swords and stars refer to the former general's career, as does the crest, which is the badge of the 101st Airborne (which he served as a brigade commander in the mid-1970s). The lion may be an allusion to Scotland. The shield can be shown surrounded by the insignia of an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Honorable [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB), an award the General received after the first Gulf War.
* In 2005, Powell received the [[Bishop John T. Walker Distinguished Humanitarian Service Award]] for his contributions to Africa.
