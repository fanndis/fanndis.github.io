==History==
Although often confused with the [[American Bankers Association]] or other industry trade groups, ''American Banker'' is an independent newspaper and is unaffiliated with any portion of the banking industry.  The newspaper was founded as "Thompson's Bank Note Reporter" in 1836 by American financier [[John Thompson (banker)|John Thompson]]. In 1885, the renamed "Thomson's Bank-Note and Commercial Reporter" was purchased by [[Anthony Stumpf]] (1856-1927)<ref>"Anthony Stumpf Dies Suddenly," ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 18, 1927</ref> and [[Charles David Steurer]] (1859-1933),<ref>http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-no2012139960/</ref> master printers who renamed the weekly publication ''The American Banker''.<ref>Men of the Century, an Historical Work: Giving Portraits and Sketches of Eminent Citizens of the United States, Charles Morris, January 1, 1896,
I. R. Hamersly & Company</ref> The article "the" was dropped from the title decades later. ''American Banker'' became a daily newspaper in 1899.<ref>American Banker 150th Anniversary, 1836 to 1986, a Commemorative Edition, Library of Congress catalog number HG2461 A4B3 1986</ref>

===The Otis years, ca. 1910-1983===
Members of the [[Otis family]] of Boston purchased the newspaper and its sister publication, ''[[Bond Buyer]]'', around 1910, and for several decades it remained a family-owned enterprise. [[Charles Otis (businessman)|Charles Otis]], a former president of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and its parent company, [[Dow Jones & Company]], became president and publisher in 1913 and remained in that role until his death in 1944. In 1936, Charles Otis announced the newspaper was marking 100 years of continuous publication by producing a century edition.<ref>"Banking Paper 100 Years Old," ''The New York Times'', March 31, 1936, page 35</ref> In 1976, the newspaper's management was overhauled. Willard S. Rappleye Jr., a former ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine editor was dismissed after 13 years at the helm. ''American Banker''{{'}}s president, Edward F. McDougal, resigned in protest, and financial editor Ben Weberman also resigned. William S.Shanks, president and minority owner of ''Bond Buyer'', was named president of ''American Banker''.<ref>"American Banker Shifts Top Management," ''The New York Times'', January 8, 1976</ref> A year later, Shanks was dismissed from both posts by Derick Otis Steinmann (1943-2002),{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} an Otis family descendant.<ref>"Bond Buyer Makes Management Shifts," ''The New York Times'', March 16, 1977</ref>
 
Steinmann was Chairman and CEO of ''American Banker'' and ''Bond Buyer'' from 1976 to the mid-1980s.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/17/classified/paid-notice-deaths-steinmann-derick-otis.html</ref> Steinmann transitioned the newspapers to the computer era, and facilitated their sale in 1983 to [[International Thomson]], from the estate of Charles Otis.<ref>"Thomson to Buy American Banker," ''The New York Times'', February 15, 1983</ref>

===Subsequent ownership===
[[Thomson Corporation]] began selling its North American newspapers in 2000 and announced its intention to put ''American Banker'' and ''Bond Buyer'' on the market in 2001.<ref>"Bond Buyer and American Banker to Be Sold," ''The New York Times'', February 28, 2001</ref> In 2004, ''American Banker'' and ''Bond Buyer'' were sold to Investcorp,<ref>"Investcorp Pays $350 Million for Thomson's Media Group," ''The New York Times'', October 9, 2004</ref> which operated it as part of its [[SourceMedia]] business.<ref>https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E7DA123BF93AA35753C1A9629C8B63&scp=1&sq=Investcorp%20American%20Banker&st=cse</ref> In 2014, Investcorp sold SourceMedia to Observer Capital, a private equity firm founded by Joseph Meyer, the publisher of ''[[The New York Observer]]''.<ref>Corporate press release: "SourceMedia Announces Acquisition by Observer Capital," August 7, 2014</ref>
