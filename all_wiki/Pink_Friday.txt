'''''Pink Friday''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by Trinidadian-American rapper [[Nicki Minaj]]. It was released on November 22, 2010 by [[Young Money Entertainment|Young Money]], [[Cash Money Records|Cash Money]] and [[Universal Motown]]. After signing a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment in 2009, Minaj began planning the album that same year and work continued into 2010. Minaj enlisted a variety of producers whose efforts resulted in a primarily [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] record, which sees additional influences from [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[pop music]]. The album features guest vocals from [[Eminem]], [[Rihanna]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], [[will.i.am]], [[Kanye West]] and [[Natasha Bedingfield]].

The album was promoted with eight [[single (music)|singles]], including the internationally successful single "[[Super Bass]]", and US ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]] top 40 singles "[[Your Love (Nicki Minaj song)|Your Love]]", "[[Check It Out (will.i.am and Nicki Minaj song)|Check It Out]]", "[[Right Thru Me]]", "[[Moment 4 Life]]", and "[[Fly (Nicki Minaj song)|Fly]]". Minaj also supported the album with a five-date promotional concert tour during October 2010.

After a much anticipated release as the result of Minaj's extensive featured appearances on the singles of other artists, ''Pink Friday'' debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 375,000 copies in its first week.<ref name="BB200">{{cite web|first=Keith|last=Caulfield|title=Kanye West, Nicki Minaj Score Big Debuts on Billboard 200|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/950035/kanye-west-nicki-minaj-score-big-debuts-on-billboard-200|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=December 1, 2010}}</ref> It ultimately reached number one on the chart and also charted within the top 20 in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pink Friday – Nicki Minaj|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=nicki minaj|chart=Billboard 200}}|work=Billboard|access-date=November 19, 2012}}</ref> As of February 2018, the album has sold two million traditional copies in the United States.<ref name="US_Sales">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8207018/rewinding-the-charts-in-2011-nicki-minajs-pink-friday-was-red|title=Rewinding the Charts: In 2011, Nicki Minaj's 'Pink Friday' Was Red-Hot|work=Billboard|access-date=February 20, 2018}}</ref> The album has been certified 3× platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for combined album sales, track sales, and song streams equivalent of three million album-sale units.

==Background==
After a major record label bidding war, [[Young Money Entertainment]] announced on August 31, 2009 that Minaj had been released from a [[360 deal]] with the label in which she retains and owns all of her 360 rights – including merchandising, sponsorships, endorsements, touring and publishing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=56127 |title=XXcLusive: Nicki Minaj Signs With Young Money/Universal |publisher=XXLmag.com |access-date=August 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126015354/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=56127 |archive-date=January 26, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Sessions for the album began in 2009 with a tentative release set for the second quarter of 2010. Minaj stated in an MTV interview that "Married in the Club" was set to be the lead single from the album and was slated for a November 2009 release.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1623931/20091015/minaj__nicki.jhtml |title=Nicki Minaj Says Her Debut Single Will Drop Next Month – News Story &#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=October 15, 2009 |access-date=August 5, 2010}}</ref> Plans for the single were cancelled and Minaj explained in a February 2010 interview with MTV that she had scrapped the previous material and began recording again from scratch. Minaj explained, "I have songs that where I am now, they aren't a great representation of me to where I'm at musically. I wanna start from scratch but I do have my single and it'll be out."

Nicki Minaj spoke about the great importance of the album to her and all females in hip-hop in an interview with ''V103's Greg Street'', stating; "They won't look to sign other female rappers because they'll say, 'Her buzz was so crazy and if she couldn't do it, then no one can do it.' And I don't want that to happen, so I'm doing this as well for all the girls. I hope that with the success of the album—because I know it will be successful, I believe it will be successful—I hope that this opens doors for all of the girls everywhere. Even as far as I've come right now, it's a testament in my mind," she said. "So I hope the female rappers will understand how big it is, just for our culture, that the album does well."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/09/01/nicki-minaj-says-pink-friday-is-crucial-for-female-raps-future/ |title=Nicki Minaj Says 'Pink Friday' Is Crucial for Female Rap's Future |publisher=Rap-Up.com |access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' Minaj stated that she would be toning down her sex appeal for the album, stating: "I made a conscious decision to try to tone down the sexiness, I want people—especially young girls—to know that in life, nothing is going to be based on sex appeal.

"[[Massive Attack (song)|Massive Attack]]" was released on April 13, 2010 through digital distribution. The song was a distinct change from Minaj's previous work on mixtapes and features, thus receiving mixed to positive reviews from critics, commending lyrical content and distinctiveness, but critiquing that it did not fit her "Barbie" persona well. The song bubbled under the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at number 22, and peaked at number 65 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart.
