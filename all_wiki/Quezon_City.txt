It is the largest city in terms of population and land area in [[Metro Manila]], the National Capital Region of the Philippines. Quezon City is not located in, and should not be confused with the [[Quezon|province of Quezon]], which was also named after the president.

Quezon City hosts a number of government offices, the most important of which are the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]] (the seat of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], the [[lower chamber]] of the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]]), and the [[Quezon City Reception House]] (the current seat of the [[Vice President of the Philippines]]).<ref name="qcpubliclibrary.org" /> Quezon City also serves as home to the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]]—the national university—and [[Ateneo de Manila University]].

Also located in Quezon City is the [[Quezon Memorial Circle]], a [[national park]]. The park is an ellipse bounded by [[Elliptical Road]]. Its main feature is the [[Quezon Memorial Shrine]], a 66-meter-tall [[mausoleum]] containing the remains of President Quezon and his wife, [[First Spouse of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Aurora Quezon]]. The shrine is considered Quezon City's foremost landmark and is depicted in its city seal.

== History ==
[[File:Manuel L. Quezon (November 1942).jpg|thumb|180px|left|Commonwealth President [[Manuel L. Quezon]].]]

Before Quezon City was created, its land was settled by the small individual towns of [[Quezon City#San Francisco del Monte|San Francisco del Monte]], [[Quezon City#Novaliches|Novaliches]], and Balintawak. On August 23, 1896, the [[Katipunan]], led by its ''Supremo'' [[Andrés Bonifacio]], [[Cry of Pugad Lawin|launched]] the [[Philippine Revolution]] against the [[Spanish Empire]] at the house of [[Melchora Aquino]] in Pugad Lawin (now known as Balintawak).

In the early 20th century, President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] dreamt of a city that would become the future capital of the country to replace Manila. It is believed that his earlier trip in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] influenced his vision.<ref name="QC001">{{cite web|url=http://www.quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&id=319&Itemid=277|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426201638/http://www.quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&id=319&Itemid=277|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 26, 2014|title=Milestones in History|author=Web Admin|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name="QC002">{{cite web|url=http://info.philtravelcenter.com/qc-history.php|title=Quezon City Brief History, Philippines (Official Website of PhilTravelcenter.com – Quezon City Metro Manila, Philippines)|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref>

In 1938, President Quezon created the People's Homesite Corporation and purchased {{convert|15.29|km2|0|abbr=on}} from the vast [[Quezon City#Diliman|Diliman]] Estate of the Tuason family; this piece of land became known then as ''Barrio Obrero'' ("Workers' Village"). The [[National Assembly of the Philippines]] passed ''Commonwealth Act 502'', known as the Charter of Quezon City, originally proposed as "Balintawak City; Assemblymen [[Narciso Ramos]] and Ramon Mitra Sr. successfully lobbied the assembly to name the city after the incumbent president. President Quezon allowed the bill to lapse into law without his signature on October 12, 1939, thus establishing Quezon City.<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" />

When Quezon City was created in 1939, the following barrios or sitios: Balingasa, Balintawak, Galas, Kaingin, Kangkong, La Loma, Malamig, Masambong, Matalahib, San Isidro, San Jose, Santol, and Tatalon from [[Caloocan]]; Cubao, the western half of Diliman, Kamuning, New Manila, Roxas, and San Francisco del Monte from [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]; Balara, Barangka, the eastern half of Diliman, Jesus de la Peña and Krus na Ligas from [[Marikina]]; Libis, Santolan and Ugong Norte from [[Pasig]] and some barrios from [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]] and [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] were to be given to the new capital city. Instead of opposing them, the six towns willingly gave land to Quezon City in the belief that it would benefit the country's new capital. However, in 1941, the area within [[Wack Wack Golf and Country Club]] was reverted to [[Mandaluyong]], and Barangka and Jesus de la Peña to Marikina. In addition, the land of [[Camp Crame]] was originally part of San Juan. On January 1, 1942, President Quezon issued an executive order from the tunnel of [[Corregidor]] designating Jorge Vargas Mayor of [[City of Greater Manila|Greater Manila]], a new political entity comprising, aside from Manila proper, Quezon City, Caloocan, Pasay, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Parañaque.<ref name="GovPH-EO400">{{cite web |title=Executive Order No. 400, s. 1942 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1942/01/01/executive-order-no-400-s-1942/ |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=21 April 2020 |date=1 January 1942}}</ref> Greater Manila would later be expanded to include Las Piñas, Malabon, and Navotas.

[[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces occupied Quezon City in 1942 during [[World War II]]. In October of that year, the Japanese authorities organized the City of Greater Manila into twelve districts, two of which were formed by dividing Quezon City:  Balintawak which consisted of San Francisco del Monte, Galas, and La Loma; and Diliman which consisted of Diliman proper, Cubao, and the University District. In 1945, combined Filipino and American troops under the [[United States Army]], [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]], and [[Philippine Constabulary]], with help from recognized guerrilla units, liberated and recaptured Quezon City in a few months, expelling Imperial Japanese forces.  Heavy fighting occurred near Novaliches, which at that time was in Caloocan, and New Manila which was a [[strongpoint]].  Smaller actions were fought at Barrio Talipapa and the University District.  Toward the end of the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], Pres. [[Sergio Osmeña]] dissolved the Greater Manila Complex, which included the Japanese-created districts of Balintawak and Diliman which had been formed from the prewar Quezon City.

After the war, ''Republic Act No. 333'', which redefined the Caloocan–Quezon City boundary, was signed by President [[Elpidio Quirino]] on July 17, 1948, declaring Quezon City to be the national capital, and specifying the city's area to be {{convert|156.60|km²|0|abbr=on}}.

On October 1, 1975, Quezon City was the actual site of the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]" boxing fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]], which took place at the [[Araneta Coliseum]]. It was renamed as the "Philippine Coliseum" for the event.

On November 7, 1975, the promulgation of ''Presidential Decree No. 824'' of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] established Metro Manila.<ref name="GovPH-PD824">{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree No. 824, s. 1975 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1975/11/07/presidential-decree-no-824-s-1975/ |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=21 April 2020 |date=7 November 1975}}</ref><ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" /> Quezon City became one of Metro Manila's 17 cities and municipalities.

On February 23, 1998, ''Republic Act. No. 8535'' was signed by President [[Fidel Ramos]].<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" /> The Act provided for the creation of the City of Novaliches comprising the 15 northernmost barangays of Quezon City.<ref name="ChanRobles-RA8535">{{cite web |title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8535 |url=https://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/86_republicacts.php?id=8392 |website=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |accessdate=21 April 2020 |date=23 February 1998}}</ref> However, in the succeeding plebiscite on October 23, 1999, an overwhelming majority of Quezon City residents rejected the secession of Novaliches.

Quezon City is the first local government in the Philippines with a computerized real estate assessment and payment system. The city government developed a database system in 2015 that contains around 400,000 property units with capability to record payments.<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" />

The city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15, 2020 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].

In 1938, President Quezon made a decision to push for a new capital city. [[Manila]] was getting crowded, and his [[military advisor]]s (reportedly) told him that Manila, being by the bay, was an easy target for bombing by [[Naval artillery|naval guns]] in case of attack–a real possibility in the late 1930s. Military advisers, however, did not anticipate aerial bombardment.<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" />

Quezon supported the idea of a new city at least {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} away from [[Manila Bay]] (beyond the reach of naval guns). He contacted [[William E. Parsons]], American architect and planner, who had been the consulting architect for the islands early in the American colonial period. Parsons came over in the summer of 1939 and helped select the Diliman (Tuason) estate as the site for the new city. Unfortunately, he died later that year, leaving his partner Harry Frost to take over. Frost collaborated with [[Juan Arellano]], engineer A.D. Williams, and landscape architect and planner Louis Croft to craft a grand master plan for the new capital.<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" />

The plan was approved by the Philippine authorities in 1941. The core of the new city was to be a {{convert|400|ha|adj=on}} central green, about the size of [[New York City|New York's]] [[Central Park]], and defined by North, South (Timog), East and West Avenues. On one corner of the proposed Diliman Quadrangle was delineated a {{convert|25|ha|adj=on}} elliptical site. This was to contain a large capitol building to house the [[Philippine Legislature]] and ancillary structures for the offices of representatives.<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" />

On either side of the giant ellipse were supposed to have been the new [[Malacañan Palace]] on North Avenue (site of the present-day [[Veterans Memorial Medical Center|Veterans Memorial Hospital]]), and the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] Complex along [[East Avenue, Quezon City|East Avenue]] (now the site of [[East Avenue Medical Center]]). The three branches of government were to be finally and efficiently located in close proximity to each other.<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" />

== Geography ==
[[File:Quezon City Elevation Map.png|thumb|Elevation map of Quezon City. The drop in elevation along the eastern border of the city follows the length of the West Valley Fault.]]
The city lies on the Guadalupe Plateau, a relatively high plateau at the northeast of the metropolis situated between the lowlands of [[Manila]] to the southwest and the [[Marikina River]] Valley to the east. The southern portion is drained by the narrow [[San Juan River (Quezon City)|San Juan River]] and its tributaries to [[Pasig River]], while running in the northern portions of the city is the equally-narrow [[Tullahan River]]. The [[Marikina Valley Fault System|West Valley Fault]] traverses the eastern border of the city. 

Quezon City is bordered by [[Manila]] to the southwest, by [[Caloocan]] and [[Valenzuela City]] to the west and northwest. To the south lie [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[Mandaluyong]], while [[Marikina]] and Pasig border the city to the southeast. To the north across Marilao River lies [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]], while to the east lie [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]] and [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]], both in the province of [[Rizal]].

The city can be divided into a number of areas. The southern portion of the city is divided into a number of districts including Diliman, Commonwealth, the Project areas, Cubao, Kamias, Kamuning, New Manila, San Francisco del Monte, and Santa Mesa Heights. The northern half of the city is often called Novaliches and contains the areas of Fairview and Lagro. Most of these areas have no defined boundaries and are primarily residential in nature.

=== Climate ===
Quezon City features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] Am), with prominent [[dry season]] from December to April, in which in turn, divided into cool and warm dry seasons, and a prolonged [[wet season]] from May to November that brings heavy rains in some areas.

According to the 2015 Census, the population of the city was {{PH wikidata|population_total}}, making it by far the [[List of cities in the Philippines|most populous city]] in the Philippines. This figure is higher by more than 1.1&nbsp;million from [[Manila]], the country's second-most populous city.

The increase in the population of the city has been dramatic considering that it was only founded/consolidated (and sparsely populated) in 1939. Quezon City became the biggest city in terms of population in the Philippines in 1990 when it finally surpassed the number of inhabitants of the densely populated [[Manila|City of Manila]]. Quezon City's population continued to increase and went on to become the first Philippine city (and as of 2017 the only city) to reach 2 million people (in the late 1990s). The population is projected to reach 3&nbsp;million people between the 2015 and 2020 census years and 4&nbsp;million people between the 2025 and 2030 census years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/2015/09/19/1501296/philippine-cities-over-1m-population-nearly-triple-2025|title=Philippine cities with over 1M population to nearly triple by 2025|last=Mercurio|first=Richmond S.|date=September 19, 2015|work=The Philippine Star}}</ref>

The trend is also seen in the significant increase in the percentage share of Quezon City to the total population of what is now called Metro Manila. Its share comes from a low of less than 10% in the 1950s to 21.0%<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.makati.gov.ph/portal/uploads/staticmenu/docs/Human%20Resource.pdf|title=Profile of Makati City|website=Makati City Government}}</ref> in 1980 and then to 22.8% in 2015.

Quezon City is predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] with roughly 90% affiliation in the population; Novaliches Diocese had a 90% Roman Catholic adherence while the Diocese of Cubao had a Roman Catholic adherence of more than 88% (Catholic Diocese Hierarchy, 2003). In 2002, Quezon City was made an [[episcopal see]] for two new Catholic dioceses: ''[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao|Cubao]]'' and ''[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Novaliches|Novaliches]]'', as the very populous [[Archdiocese of Manila]] was carved up and five new dioceses created.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

A number of religious orders have set up convents and seminaries in the city. Various [[Protestantism|Protestant faiths]] have seen a significant increase in membership over recent decades<ref>{{cite web|last=Central Intelligence Agency |title=The World Factbook |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |work=Philippines – People and Society |accessdate=January 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111070218/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |archive-date=January 11, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Manila : Republic of the Philippines, Philippine Statistics Authority|title=The Philippines in figures|journal=WorldCat|year=2010}}</ref> and are well represented in Quezon City.

=== Railways ===
Two elevated light rail systems and one heavy rail system run through Quezon City:
[[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|Line 1]] – at EDSA (C-4) connecting [[North Avenue Grand Central Station|North Avenue]] and [[Baclaran station|Baclaran]] ([[Manila]]) [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]] – at [[Aurora Boulevard]] (R-6) connecting [[Santolan station (Line 2)|Santolan]] ([[Marikina]]) and [[Recto station|Recto]] (C-1 in [[Manila]]), and [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3|Line 3]] – at [[EDSA (road)|EDSA (C-4)]] from [[Taft Avenue MRT Station|Taft Avenue]] (R-2 in [[Pasay]]) to [[North Avenue MRT Station|North Avenue]].

An elevated rail transit system (original Line 4) that was supposed to follow the general alignment of Quezon and [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenues (R-7)]] was shelved. In its place, a 22 kilometer rail system will be built. The Line 7 project will commence at North Avenue, connecting the Line 3 at its northern terminus. It will then go through [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue]], then through [[Regalado Highway|Regalado]], [[Quirino Highway (Quezon City)|Quirino Highway]], ending in [[San Jose del Monte]], [[Bulacan]]. The system has a proposed spur line to connect itself to Line 2 in [[Katipunan Avenue|Katipunan]], passing through the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] and Katipunan Avenue.

An elevated [[Automated Guideway Transit]] system is currently under construction in [[UP Diliman]].

The following elevated railway stations in the city (Only 13 Stations):

== Government ==
[[File:Tomas Morato.jpg|thumb|[[Tomás Morató]], the first mayor of Quezon City.]]
Like other [[cities in the Philippines]], Quezon City is governed by a [[mayor]] and [[Deputy mayor|vice mayor]] elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the city's departments in executing the [[Local ordinance|city ordinances]] and improving public services. The vice mayor heads the [[City council|legislative council]] consisting of 24 members. These [[councilor]]s represent the six (6) [[Congressional district|legislative districts]] of the city. The council is in charge of formulating and enacting the city.

Quezon City, being a part of the Metro Manila region, has its mayor in the Metro Manila Council headed by the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA). This council formulates development plans that seek to solve the problems and improve the conditions in the [[metropolis]].

=== Mayors ===
{{Main|List of mayors of Quezon City}}
[[Manuel Quezon|President Manuel L. Quezon]] acted as mayor from October 12 to November 4, 1939, pending the resignation from another position of his intended appointee, [[Tomas Morato|Tomas B. Morato]]. Since a president can, under Philippine law, hold multiple portfolios inferior to his office, Quezon took the position of mayor in a concurrent capacity. However, it is erroneous to view him as the first mayor, as a president holding a concurrent position is not listed in the roster of incumbents for those offices.

=== Barangays ===
{{See also|Barangays of Quezon City}}
Quezon City is made up of 142 [[barangay]]s (the smallest local government units) which handle governance in a much smaller area. These barangays are grouped into the aforementioned legislative districts. Each district, in turn, is represented in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].

== Districts ==
[[File:Ph fil quezon city barangay.png|thumb|220px|Political map of Quezon City]]
Quezon City is divided into six legislative districts, in turn subdivided in a total of [[Barangays of Quezon City|142 barangays]]. Each district is represented by six City Councilors, six representatives/congressmen, one from each district are elected as members of the National Legislature. The number of barangays per district is: District I, 37; District II, 5; District III, 37; District IV, 38; District V, 14; and District VI, 11; Although District II has the fewest barangays, it is the biggest in land area, including the Novaliches Reservoir.

The [[La Mesa Watershed Reservation]] in Novaliches is the last forest of its size in the metropolis; the La Mesa Dam is an [[earth dam]] whose reservoir can hold up to 50.5&nbsp;million cubic meters and occupying an area of {{convert|27|km²|0|abbr=out}}, it is also part of the [[Angat Dam|Angat]]–[[Ipo Dam|Ipo]]–La Mesa water system which supplies most of the water supply of [[Metro Manila]].

=== Bagumbayan ===
Located at the southeastern corner of Quezon City, Bagumbayan is one of the newly developed commercial areas in Quezon City. The Eastwood City Business Center is situated here. It consists of several office and residential skyscrapers, including many local IT and consumer electronic firms. Numerous bars and restaurants have been put up since 2000 along [[Circumferential Road 5|E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5)]]. Many of which are open-air restaurants and coffee shops reminiscent of Paris boulevards, but with a modern architecture. With this, Bagumbayan is fast becoming one of the hippest areas for night entertainment, similar to the [[Malate, Manila|Malate]] and [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]] districts of Manila.

West of Bagumbayan are many high-end gated communities like the Acropolis, Blue Ridge, Greenmeadows, White Plains, Corinthian Hills, and Corinthian Gardens. Further west are Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame. Camp Aguinaldo is the general headquarters of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] while Camp Crame is the headquarters of the [[Philippine National Police]]. Bagumbayan also covers a sliver of [[Ortigas Center]] business district at the southeast corner of EDSA and Ortigas Avenue, where [[Robinsons Galleria]], the [[EDSA Shrine]], and Cyberpod Corinthian are located. It also houses the [[Circulo Verde]] mixed-use development.

'''Balintawak'''

Formerly a district of Caloocan, Balintawak is the location of the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin]], where the fight for independence against the Spaniards started. The area consist of the barangays of [[Balingasa|Balinsaga]] (Cloverleaf), Apolonio Samson, Pag- Ibig sa Nayon, Balong Bato, and Unang Sigaw. The area is located along EDSA (C-4) and [[North Luzon Expressway|NLEX (E-1)]].

=== Commonwealth Avenue ===
[[File:Batasan front qc.jpg|thumb|The [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], home to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]]]
North of Diliman lies the Commonwealth area, so named because of [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue (R-7)]] (formerly called Don Mariano Marcos Avenue) which runs through its center. Barangays in this area include [[Batasan Hills, Quezon City|Batasan Hills]], [[Barangay Commonwealth]], Holy Spirit and Old Balara. This is primarily a residential area home to many subdivisions ([[Homeowner association|residential associations]]), among these are Ferndale Villas, Don Antonio Royale, Don Antonio Heights, BF Homes QC, Ferndale Homes, Vista Real, Filinvest 1 and 2, New Capitol Estates and others. The government center in Quezon City was originally planned to be at what is now the location of the Quezon Memorial Circle,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qcpubliclibrary.org/qcmanuscript.php|title=Quezon City Public Library – Quezonian Newsletter|accessdate=September 14, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083509/http://www.qcpubliclibrary.org/qcmanuscript.php|archive-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref> but it was then moved further north to where Batasan hills is now. Resultantly, there are important government establishments nearby such as the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit of the Philippines]], the [[Sandiganbayan]], a special court with a rank equivalent to the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals]] and the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], which houses the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|lower house of the Philippine Congress]]. Schools within the Commonwealth area include the [[School of the Holy Spirit]], Our Lady of Mercy School, Diliman Preparatory School, The Seed Montessori, Mary the Queen College, Capitol Hills Christian School, and the Asian Institute of Computer Studies. Ironically, this is also an area of sheer contrasts and a display of the acute economic differences in [[Metro Manila]], with kilometers of [[shanty town|shanty houses]] aligning the avenue on both sides. Parts of these are often being demolished just to be re-occupied by informal settlers soon after.

Several of the streets in the surrounding area were named in honor of the 22 [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]] who died in a [[United Arab Airlines Flight 869 (1963)|plane crash]] ''en route'' to joining the [[11th World Scout Jamboree]]. A memorial stands in the center of a rotunda at the intersection of Timog and Tomas Morato Avenues, which accounts for the Timog area being called the 'Scout Area'. Near the scouting memorial is the location of the former Ozone disco, site of the [[Ozone Disco Club fire|worst fire in Philippine history]].

The Quezon City Hall, one of the tallest city halls in the country, is located along the Circle. Surrounding the city hall are spacious parks and open areas. The head offices of some national government agencies are located in Diliman. Near the Circle are many important health centers and institutions.

=== Galas-Santol ===
[[File:WTMP Redscale C-9 IMG 7199.JPG|thumbnail|[[SM City Santa Mesa]]]]
The Galas-Santol District of Quezon City is located in its southwest border with the City of [[Manila]]. Located in the Galas area is the elementary school named after Manuel L. Quezon's wife, Aurora A. Quezon. Carlos L. Albert High School is named after a former vice mayor of the city. The [[SM City Santa Mesa]] is located in the Galas-Santol District. It is the second of [[SM Supermall]] and the seventh SM branch developed and operated by [[SM Prime Holdings]] owned by [[Henry Sy]] Sr.. It has a land area of 3 hectares and has a gross floor area of an approximate 133,327 square meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://smprime.com/smprime/index.php?p=671&mall=13 |title=SM City Santa Mesa |work=[[SM Prime Holdings]] Mall List |publisher=[[SM Prime Holdings]] |accessdate=January 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708035317/http://www.smprime.com/smprime/index.php?p=671&mall=13 |archive-date=July 8, 2014 }}</ref> The mall opened to the public on September 28, 1990, and was the second SM Supermall to open after the largest [[SM Supermall]] in the Philippines at the time, [[SM City North EDSA]].

One of the vast areas in the Galas-Santol area is the Quezon Institute compound which was originally the site of Q.I. Hospital for tuberculosis-stricken patients. The hospital was established under the auspices of the Philippines Tuberculosis Society. {{As of|2015}}, a large portion of the compound have ceased to form part of the hospital which remained operational up until now facing E. Rodriguez Avenue between Banawe and [[Gregorio Araneta Avenue|G. Araneta Avenue]].

The main road traversing the area is Santol Road which stretch from the [[Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard]] near Stop and Shop and [[Victorino Mapa Street|V.

=== La Loma ===
La Loma is located on the southwest area of Quezon City. It is composed of five barangays along the vicinity of its main streets, N.S. Amoranto Avenue (Retiro) and A. Bonifacio Avenue. The district is famed as the birthplace of many popular Filipino culinary figures and establishments,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pinoytravelblog.com/travel-destinations/178/la-loma-lechon-quezon-city |title=La Loma Lechon, Quezon City. &#124; Philippine Travel Blog – The Travelers Guide to Philippine Destinations |publisher=Pinoytravelblog.com |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=May 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230083545/http://www.pinoytravelblog.com/travel-destinations/178/la-loma-lechon-quezon-city |archive-date=December 30, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> especially devoted to the [[lechon]].

=== Loyola Heights ===
[[File:Church of the gesu.jpg|thumb|The Church of the Gesù in the [[Ateneo de Manila University]]]]
Loyola Heights, to the southeast of Diliman is [[Marikina City]]'s gateway to Quezon City. The Aurora Boulevard (R-6) and Katipunan Avenue (C-5) provide easy access, but often experience traffic jams during rush hours. Also located in Loyola Heights is the [[Katipunan station]] of [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]] , which runs in an east–west direction, providing rapid access to the cities of [[Manila]], Quezon City, [[Marikina City|Marikina]] and [[Pasig City|Pasig]], and San Juan. Passengers can transfer to [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|Line 1]] at [[Recto station]] in Manila, or to the [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3|Line 3]] at [[Araneta Center–Cubao station (Line 2)|Araneta Center–Cubao station]].

The main campus of [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and Miriam College are located in Loyola Heights.

Loyola Heights also has numerous commercial study centers such as The Loyola Heights–Xavierville Kumon Center, Newton Study Center, LHSC, and others which offer after-school tutorial services.

Loyola Heights is an upper middle-class and rich residential area that caters to students of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], [[Ateneo de Manila University]], and Miriam College, members of the schools' faculty and staff, and their families. La Vista Subdivision, north of Miriam College, is an upscale [[gated community]] where some of the country's top politicians own residences, including former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], as well as many of the country's moneyed elite. Accessed through La Vista is Loyola Grand Villas, another upscale gated community. Across Katipunan, the main thoroughfare of the area, are Varsity Hills and Xavierville, both upper class and upper middle-class subdivisions. Near and even within these subdivisions, and right beside La Vista, are some [[slum|informal settlements]], making the Loyola Heights area a place of mixed socio-economic classes.

[[File:7975Balete Drive Quezon City Landmarks 34.jpg|thumb|Balete Drive]]
New Manila is located on west central portion of the city. The largely residential district takes its name from Quezon City's neighbour to the southwest, the City of Manila. The district was a former part of neighboring City of San Juan. The area was first settled after the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]] by affluent families who wished to escape the stress of living in the capital. As a result, many of the houses here stand on lots measuring 500 square meters and above.
Among its notable residents are the Hemady-Ysmael Family, the original landowner of New Manila; Dona [[Narcisa de Leon]], the Matriarch of LVN Studios had a Residence on 25. Broadway Avenue, Also Iglesia ni Cristo Central Office, is once Hosted at New Manila in 42. Broadway Avenue. It is also known as the Birthplace of Bro. [[Felix Manalo]]'s 5th Child which became his Successor, Bro. [[Erano Manalo]].<ref>https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/11/01/19/the-spirits-of-42-broadway-avenue</ref>

The main thoroughfares are Aurora Boulevard, [[Gilmore Avenue, Quezon City|Gilmore Avenue]], and Eulogio Rodriguez Sr. Avenue. Aurora Boulevard begins at the Quezon City – Manila border and reaches New Manila upon crossing EDSA. Gilmore crosses Ortigas Avenue, giving it access to [[Mandaluyong]], Pasig, and San Juan, Metro Manila. Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr. Avenue diverges from Aurora Boulevard a few meters from EDSA.

Aurora Boulevard is the site of [[Broadway Centrum]], where the first GMA Network entertainment shows and noontime show ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' were shot; Broadway Centrum was also given to [[TV5 (Philippines)|5]] for its TV shows until it is moved out in the site to [[TV5 Media Center]] at Mandaluyong City.<ref name="inquirer">{{cite news|url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20100930-295268/Complete-creative-freedom-in-TV5-shows |title=Complete creative freedom in TV5 shows|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=July 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306121032/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20100930-295268/Complete-creative-freedom-in-TV5-shows |archive-date=March 6, 2014 }}</ref> [[St. Paul University of Quezon City]] stands at the corner of Aurora Boulevard and Gilmore Avenue, across a row of shops specializing in computer equipment, and a branch of SYKES Asia.

Also located near New Manila is Quezon City's "Funeral Home Row", [[Gregorio Araneta Avenue|Araneta Avenue]]. This is attributed to the unusually high concentration of funeral homes in the area. Curiously, also located along [[Gregorio Araneta Avenue|Araneta Avenue]] is Sanctuarium, a multi-storey [[columbarium]] and funeral home. [[Balete Drive]], between Aurora Boulevard and Eulogio Rodriguez Sr. Avenue, is also the setting for many urban legends. The cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao]] is located along Lantana Street, near Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr. Avenue. The offices and studios of [[MOWELFUND]] are located a few blocks from the cathedral.

New Manila is also the site of the official residence and workplace of the [[Vice President of the Philippines]], [[Quezon City Reception House]].

=== Novaliches ===
{{redirect|Novaliches|the Spanish general|Manuel Pavía y Lacy}}
[[File:LaMesaDamEcopark1.jpg|thumb|[[La Mesa Watershed and Eco-Park]].]]
[[File:Ph=mm=quezon city=novaliches=quirino hwy.=sm city fairview - main bldg. -philippines--2015-0331--ls-.jpg|thumb|[[SM City Fairview]]]]
Novaliches was named after the Marquis of Novaliches, [[Manuel Pavía y Lacy]], born in [[Granada]], the general who protected Queen Isabella of Spain from her uncle Don Carlos who tried to usurp the Spanish crown, and supporter of her son, King Alfonso, upon the monarchy's restoration. He was made the first [[Marquis of Novaliches]] / [[Marqués de Novaliches]], a title bestowed with ''[[Grandeza]] de España'' ([[Grandee of Spain]]--- first class rank among the nobility), in the 1840s. Novaliches or ''New Liches'' came from an old district ( also known as ''pedania'') of [[Valencia]], Spain where general Pavia won a string of successful victories against the [[Carlist]] faction.  The title is perpetually attached to the minor title of [[Viscount of Rabosal]] / ([[Vizconde de Rabosal]]) after [[Sendero de Rabosal]], an arid mountainous trail long used by military squadrons into [[Jerica]] and [[Castellón de la Plana|Castellon]], in Valencia.

By marriage, he was the count-consort and second husband of the first [[Countess of Santa Isabel]], María del Carmen Álvarez de las Asturias Bohórquez y Giráldez, devoted nursemaid and babysitter / ''aya'' to Queen Isabella's daughters and a cousin of María Cristina Fernández de Córdoba y Álvarez de las Asturias- Bohórquez, the first to hold title to the [[Marquess of Griñón]] / ''[[Marquesado de Griñón]]'', now held by the half-[[Filipina]] [[Tamara Falco]], sister of the Spanish-Filipino singer [[Enrique Iglesias]] and daughter of [[Isabel Preysler]]-Perez de Tagle y Arrastia-Reinares of [[Lubao, Pampanga|Lubao]], [[Pampanga]] --- descendant of [[Pedro Sánchez de Tagle, 2nd Marquis of Altamira]] also known as the father of [[Tequila]], banker-financier to the ''[[Viceroy]] of [[Mexico]]'' as his daughter, the third ''Marquesa'' and her own husband moved to the Philippines to serve in the Spanish [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in the 1810s.  Thus, general Pavia is a great grand-uncle eight times removed to the now reigning Spanish Filipina marchioness of Griñón.  Meanwhile, her distant cousin, Santiago Matossian y Falcó now holds ''capitan general'' Pavia's wife's title as Count of Santa Isabel, since 2013.

By the early 1850s, Don Manuel reluctantly accepted the post of [[Governor General of the Philippines]]. He ruthlessly crushed the rebellion started by José Cuesta of [[Cavite]], a Spanish mestizo ---like [[Andres Bonifacio]] y de Castro of [[Trozo de Magdalena]], [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]], [[Manila]]--- who rounded ''carbineros'' and natives to fight the Spanish military government subservient to friar influence so unpopular that even many half-Spaniards began to wage arms.

''Calle Marques de Novaliches'', named in his honor, once existed in [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]], [[Manila]].  However, during the 1950s, it was renamed as [[Nicanor Padilla]] Street.

Novaliches is Quezon City's northernmost district and is primarily residential straddled by the [[La Mesa Watershed Reservation]], at its northeastern flank.  The [[La Mesa Dam]] supplies much of northern Metro Manila's water supply. Adjacent to the watershed is the [[La Mesa Watershed and Eco-Park]], Metro Manila's only forest.  This is the former location of President [[Elpidio Quirino]]'s simple retirement house and where he tended his little ''[[tumana]]'' or vegetable garden, being an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]].  Quirino was very fond of the morning fog amidst the trees of Novaliches, as well as hunting wild boars that used to roam the [[La Mesa Dam and Reservoir]].  It is also the site where the president died of a heart attack. Located in the park are convention centers, picnic areas, swimming pools, an [[Botanical garden|orchidarium]], and a large lagoon for boating activities. It was the site of the rowing and [[dragon boat]] events for the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games]].

Novaliches today is a center of commerce, owing to five large indoor malls: [[SM City Fairview]], [[Fairview Terraces]], [[Robinsons Novaliches]], [[SM City Novaliches]], and [[Novaliches Plaza Mall]].

Novaliches is the home of several educational institutions, notably St. John of Beverley, [[STI College]] Novaliches, both near SM City Novaliches, Maligaya Elementary School and Maligaya High School in Maligaya Park Subdivision, just near [[SM City Fairview]], the Metro Manila College (MMC), formerly known as Novaliches Academy (NA), [[Quezon City Polytechnic University]] at San Bartolome (The University's Main Campus), Bestlink College of the Philippines and Colegio de Santa Teresa de Avila in Kaligayahan, and Santo Niño de Novaliches School, [[Far Eastern University – Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation]], [[National College of Business and Arts]], [[Our Lady of Fatima University]] [[School of Saint Anthony]] (formerly known as St. Anthony Learning Center) in Lagro, [[Mater Carmeli School]], [[Good Shepherd Cathedral School]] in Fairview, The Lord of Grace Christian School in East Fairview, Divine Grace School in Maligaya Park Subdivision.

[[Novaliches Cathedral]] (Cathedral Shrine and Parish of the Good Shepherd), is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Novaliches]], and famed for its soaring stained glass windows and sloped modernist roofline.  The structure is made of block cement and precast cement tubes, and is somewhat reminiscent of the modernist [[Church of the Gesu]] within [[Ateneo de Manila University]], though unlike the latter the Novaliches Cathedral is more aligned with [[Brutalist]] [[Architecture]] design concepts.

Barangay Novaliches Proper, locally referred to as [[Bayan (political entity)|Bayan]] by residents of today and ''[[Poblacion]]'' during the American Commonwealth period before World War 2, has always been the economic powerhouse of the area and the gateway to [[Caloocan]] and further more to [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]].  It was a stop over point by revolutionaries for supplies in what was then a sparsely inhabited and densely forested Caloocan.  Today, it is a commercial hub of little alleys and small businesses dominated by the [[La Merced Church (Manila)|La Merced Church]] Church.  Villa Verde and Jordan Plains subdivisions are both located within walking distance to the church property.
[[File:Star Market Palengke in Novaliches.jpg|thumb|One of the many wet markets in Barangay Santa Monica, Novaliches.]]

Barangay Santa Monica (trasl:  ''Barrio of Saint Monique'') is mostly residential with smaller cuts of land.  The back portion of Geneva Gardens subdivision of the Neopolitan estate is the boundary marker between Barangay Santa Monica and Barangay North Fairview.  It is shaped by the [[Tullahan river]] at its lower elevation where excess water from the [[La Mesa Dam and Reservoir|La Mesa]] dam course through.  During the monsoon season, this area becomes prone to flooding.

Barangay Kaligayahan (transl: ''Barrio of Happiness'') is home to one of two subdivisions named after General Timoteo S Cruz / TS Cruzville (the other one is in nearby General Luis / Novaliches Bayan Proper) plus Hobart Subdivision, [[Puregold]] and Zabarte Subdivision.  Robinson's Mall Novaliches and Bloomfields Subdivision are also located here, where the expansive mango orchard of Don Roberto Villanueva (associated with [[Manila Tribune]]) and his wife the journalist and novelist Corazon Grau Villanueva used to be, and where, in their simple vacation house topped of thatched nipa leaves, the infamous [[Fernando Amorsolo]] painting of ''[[Princess Urduja]]'' used to hang. Unknown to locals, the unassuming Villanueva couple housed in their [[bahay kubo]] style home priceless Chinese antiques and Filipino paintings, now part of the legendary ''[[Roberto Villanueva Collection]]''.   Across the Villanueva property and separated by Maligaya Drive was what then the [[Manila Broadcasting Company]] estate owned by the senior members of the [[Elizalde (Filipino family)|Elizalde]] family (junior relatives of the [[Ynchausti]], [[Valentin Teus]], and [[Yrissary]] families who owned [[Ynchausti y Compañía]], [[YCO Paints]] and [[Tanduay Distillers]]) of [[Hagonoy, Bulacan|Hagonoy]] and [[San Miguel, Manila]], and whose matriarch was Doña Isabel González y Ferrer, viuda de Ynchausti, "Marquesa de Viademonte", another titled Spanish royal.  The property fronting Maligaya Park Subdivision was bordered with very tall ''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]'', commonly known as date or ''date palm'' trees found in the [[Middle East]].  The seeds were brought by the family while travelling from [[Spain]] to the Philippines via the [[Suez Canal]] aboard one of the many passenger ships owned by "[[La Compania Maritima]] de Filipinas".  None of these trees survive today.  The property is now the [[Fairview Terraces]] [[Ayala Malls|Ayala]].

Barangay Pasong Putik (transl: ''Barrio of Mud Clay for Pottery'')  is on the other side of Quirino Highway across from Barangay [[Kaligayahan]].  Teresa Heights Subdivision, New Haven Village and Rolling Halls Subdivision, together with the Brittany (and its clubhouse crowned with French mansard roofs) portion and the business park section of the Neopolitan estate, as well as [[SM Fairview]], are all located here.

Barangay [[Lagro]] and Greater Lagro is where the old Jacinto Steel Corporation factory used to stand, now the Redwood Terraces condominium complex of D.M. [[Consunji]] and the SMDC Trees Residences. Villa Vienna, a part of Neopolitan estate, is located here.  A portion of North Fairview Park subdivision falls within Barangay Greater Lagro as well.  Due to lack of funding to train priests and in order to support livelihood programs for the poor, the Jesuit priests ex appropriated much of their land, selling to developers who named it Sacred Heart Subdivision.  The Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus also operates a priesthood school, the historic yet severely simple [[Sacred Heart Novitiate]]| ''Noviciado del Sagrado Corazon'' (built before World War 2) within Barangay Greater Lagro.  There are gigantic ''[[balete tree|balete]]'' trees on this property much like the same balete trees in the Don Luis Maria Araneta property in ''Barrio [[Tungkung Mangga]]'', [[San Jose del Monte]], [[Bulacan]], past the Las Colinas Verdes luxury development, remnants of the virgin forest that once covered the entire Novaliches / Tala estate area.  The trees are so large that they drown out the noise of vehicles from Quirino Highway just outside.  Also, the simple burial grounds of Jesuit priests and headmasters of the [[Ateneo de Manila University]], together with bones retrieved from the Church of San Ignacio ruins of [[Intramuros]] bombardments, are found here.  Near the entrance of this sacred parcel, past the gargantuan trees, is an epitaph made of [[piedra china]] ([[ballast]] for the Spanish ships) dedicated to [[Pedro de Brito]], a captain and ''[[regidor]]'' of Spanish Manila, who made a fortune from the [[Manila galleon]] trade.  Brito and his wife Ana de Herrera donated the ''Hacienda de San Pedro Macati'' and the land where the [[San Pedro Macati Church]] stands on the encomienda's highest hill, ''Buenavista'', to the Jesuits. This church was previously administered by the [[Society of Jesus]] whose member, the friar Juan Delgado, SJ brought from [[Acapulco]] the ''Nuestra Señora Virgen de la Rosa'' (the icon has a secret receptacle in it which held a strand of the Virgin Mary's hair) in 1718.  (This is the same property that the [[Roxas (disambiguation)|Roxas]]<!--Intentional link to DAB page--> side of the [[Zobel de Ayala]] family inherited and which Joseph McMicking e [[Ynchausti]], married to Mercedes, master-planned to be the [[Makati]] skyline we know today). The [[Hiligaynon people|Ilonggo]] patriot Col. Joe McMicking, curiously, was directly related to the Elizaldes who owned the date-palm tree lined property which is now where the Ayala Fairview Terraces mall stands, now part of his wife's family's corporation.

Barangay [[North Fairview]] is considered part of Novaliches.  It is straddled by the end terminus of Regalado Highway and Commonwealth Avenue, and bordered by Mindanao Avenue.  The Casa Milan (with its grand neoclassical clubhouse), Sitio Seville, portions of Villa Vienna, and the entirety of Geneva Garden subdivisions of the Neopolitan estate are located here.  Many actors and actresses own residential lots or currently reside within these developments.  Mindanao Avenue is a favorite among stuntmen and film directors to stage movie scenes.

Novaliches used to be the home of [[5 (TV channel)|5]], one of the country's largest television networks, which moved to Mandaluyong in 2013. The transmitter located inside the Novaliches facility, however, is still used.<ref name="philstar.com" /><ref name="philstar">{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2014/01/06/1275435/tv5-new-year-new-home|title=TV5: New Year, New Home &#124; Entertainment, News, The Philippine Star &#124; philstar.com|work=The Philippine Star|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}</ref>

In 1999, a plebiscite was held among the voters of Quezon City to determine the cityhood of Novaliches. The proposed creation of "Novaliches City"<ref name="chanrobles">{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno8535.html|title=Philippine Laws, Statutes, and Codes – Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |author=Ronald Echalas Diaz|publisher=Chan Robles & Associates Law Firm|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}</ref> would have resulted in the secession of 15 [[barangays]] from Quezon City.

Novaliches is also home to the oldest church of the Diocese of Novaliches and the town itself, the Parish and Shrine of [[Virgin of Mercy|Our Lady of Mercy]] or the ''Nuestra Senora de la Merced''. The parish was founded on September 24, 1856 by Padre Andres Martin, O.S.A.

Nearby the Church of La Virgen de la Merced is a huge tree where [[Andres Bonifacio]] and [[Melchora Aquino|Tandang Sora]] held meetings to fight in the revolution against Spain. It is located in the grounds of Metro Manila College in Barangay Kaligayahan.

Novaliches is also the location of one of Manila's largest cemeteries, [[Holy Cross Memorial Park]] in Barangay Bagbag.  Also, it is the gateway to two other larger cemeteries, albeit located in Caloocan, [[Serenity Gardens Memorial Park]] in Barangay Deparo and [[Forest Memorial Park]] inside Banker's Village, directly within the border of [[Caloocan]] and [[Meycauayan]], [[Bulacan]] separated only by a tributary of the [[Marilao]] river.
