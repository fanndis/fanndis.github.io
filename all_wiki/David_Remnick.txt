In 2003, Remnick penned an editorial in ''The New Yorker'' in the lead-up to the Iraq War saying "the United States has been wrong, politically and morally, about Iraq more than once in the past... but... a return to a hollow pursuit of containment will be the most dangerous option of all."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/02/03/making-a-case|title=Making a Case|last=Remnick|first=David|date=February 3, 2003|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref> In the months leading up to the war, the magazine also published several articles connecting Saddam Hussein to al-Qaida, often relying on unnamed sources, or simply the claims of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, as evidence.
