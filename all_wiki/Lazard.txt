==History==
[[File:29 - New York - Octobre 2008.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Lazard's largest office is at [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]], [[New York City]], [[New York State|NY]]]]

===Early years===

On July 12, 1848, three brothers, Alexandre Lazard, Lazare Lazard, and [[Simon Lazard]], founded Lazard Frères & Co. as a [[dry goods]] merchant store in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. By 1851, Simon and two more brothers, Maurice and Elie, had all moved to [[San Francisco]], California, while Alexandre moved to New York. Lazard Frères began to serve miners engaged in the [[California Gold Rush]], and soon expanded into banking and [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]].<ref name="Rougemont, Lazard Frères 1939">Guy de Rougemont, Lazard Frères, Banquiers des Deux Mondes (1840-1939), Librairie Arthème Fayard, 2010</ref>

In 1854, Alexandre Lazard moved to [[Paris]], France, where he opened an office to complement the U.S. business. The firm began advising the French government on gold buying. In 1870, the firm continued to expand its international operations, opening an office in London as well.<ref name="Rougemont, Lazard Frères 1939" />

===The three houses of Lazard===
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the firm evolved into three “Houses of Lazard” in the United States, France, and England, separately managed but allied. The Lazard partners advised clients on financial matters and built a cross-border network of high-level relationships in business and government. Noted financial advisor [[George Blumenthal (banker)|George Blumenthal]] rose to prominence as the head of the U.S. branch of Lazard Frères and was a partner of Lazard Frères in France.<ref name="Rougemont, Lazard Frères 1939" />

In the economic boom following [[World War II]], the American operations of Lazard expanded significantly under the leadership of the financier [[André Meyer]]. Meyer and Lazard partner [[Felix Rohatyn]] have been credited with virtually inventing the modern [[mergers and acquisitions]] (M&A) market.<ref name="lazard.com">{{Cite web |title=Institutional Investor International Edition, November 2011 "The New House of Lazard" |url=http://www.lazard.com/media/16088/iimag_nov_2011_lazard.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509005542/http://www.lazard.com/media/16088/iimag_nov_2011_lazard.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2013 |access-date=July 29, 2013}}</ref>

In 1953, Lazard Investors Ltd began an asset management business in London, which is the origin of today's Lazard Asset Management.<ref name="Lazard website - About Lazard">{{Cite web |title=Lazard website - About Lazard |url=http://www.lazard.com/about-lazard/history |access-date=July 26, 2013}}</ref>

===A unified firm===
In 1977, as the health of Meyer began to deteriorate, the firm came to be controlled by [[Michel David-Weill]]. Under his leadership, the three houses of Lazard were formally united in 2000 as Lazard LLC.<ref name="Cohan, The Last Tycoons">William Cohan, ''Last Tycoons: The Secret History of Lazard Frères & Co'', Doubleday, 2007</ref>

In 2002, David-Weill hired [[Bruce Wasserstein]] to be CEO. Lazard became a public company, with nearly two-thirds of its shares owned by current and former employees in 2005. Wasserstein became its first Chairman and CEO. In connection with the [[initial public offering]] (IPO), Lazard spun off its broker-dealer business, Lazard Capital Markets.<ref name="lazard.com" />

Following Wasserstein's death in 2009, Lazard's Board of Directors elected [[Kenneth M. Jacobs]] Chairman and CEO.<ref>{{Cite news |date=November 17, 2009 |title=Lazard Names Kenneth Jacobs as Its New Chief |work=The New York Times |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/11/17/lazard-names-jacobs-as-chairman-and-ceo/}}</ref>
