The '''Goldene Kamera''' (English: ''Golden Camera'') is an annual German film and television award, awarded by the [[Funke Mediengruppe]]. The award show is usually held in early February in [[Hamburg]], but has also taken place in [[Berlin]] in the past.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The gold-plated silver award model was created by Berlin artist Wolfram Beck. It is {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} high and weighs around {{convert|900|g|lb}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenekamera.de/preisverleihung/chronik-fakten/ |title=Geschichte & Hintergründe  |publisher=Goldenekamera.de |accessdate=18 March 2015 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112053648/http://www.goldenekamera.de/preisverleihung/chronik-fakten/ |archivedate=12 January 2015 |df= }}</ref>

== History ==
The award was first presented in 1966 as a strictly German television award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenekamera.de/preisverleihung/chronik-fakten/|title=CHRONIK|publisher=Goldenekamera.de|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112034753/http://www.goldenekamera.de/preisverleihung/chronik-fakten/|archivedate=12 January 2015|url-status = dead|accessdate=18 March 2015|df=}}</ref> Since 1987, it has also been awarded to international stars. In 1995, the categories expanded to [[pop music|pop groups]] and to more public interests. In 2019, a 'Climate Action Award' was given to [[Greta Thunberg]].<ref name="Abendblatt final announcement">{{cite news |url=https://www.abendblatt.de/vermischtes/article227002771/Goldene-Kamera-2020-als-vorerst-letzte-TV-Show-geplant.html |title=Goldene Kamera 2020 als vorerst letzte Show geplant |language=German |work=[[Hamburger Abendblatt]] |agency=[[Funke Mediengruppe]] |date=5 September 2019 |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref>

In September 2019, Funke Mediengruppe announced the end of the traditional award for 2020. Due to a change in media consumption preferences of their audience in the course of [[digitization]], the manager of Funke's magazine division said that the group would instead focus on digital content like the "YouTube Goldene Kamera Digital Award".

The final 'Goldene Kamera' was planned to be awarded on 21 March 2020 with [[Thomas Gottschalk]] as presenter.<ref name="Abendblatt final announcement"/> Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the event in March was cancelled and rescheduled for 12 November 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenekamera.de/preisverleihung/article228607059/Die-GOLDENE-KAMERA-2020-wird-verschoben.html|title=Die Goldene Kamera 2020 wird verschoben|language=German|trans-title=Goldene Kamera 2020 will be postponed|date=6 March 2020|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>
