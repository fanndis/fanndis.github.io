The '''''Chicago Sun-Times''''' is a daily [[newspaper]] published in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States. It is the flagship paper of the [[Sun-Times Media Group]], and has the second largest circulation among Chicago newspapers, after the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. The modern paper grew out of the 1948 merger of the ''Chicago Sun'' and the ''[[Chicago Daily Times]]''. Journalists at the paper have received eight [[Pulitzer prize]]s, mostly in the 1970s; one recipient was [[film critic]] [[Roger Ebert]] (1975), who worked at the paper from 1967 until his death in 2013. Ownership of the paper has changed hands numerous times, including twice in the late 2010s.

==History==
The ''Chicago Sun-Times'' claims to be the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the city.  That claim is based on the 1844 founding of the ''[[Chicago Daily Journal]]'',<ref name="CHS">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/269.html |title=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]] |access-date=2007-03-01}}</ref> which was also the first newspaper to publish the rumor, now believed false, that a cow owned by [[Catherine O'Leary]] was responsible for the [[Great Chicago Fire|Chicago fire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thechicagofire.com/exoneration.php |title=Did the Cow Do It?

Canal was undamaged, gave the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' a temporary home until it could rebuild.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chicago.about.com/cs/history/a/05_great_fire.htm |title=Great Chicago Fire of 1871 |publisher=[[About.com]] |access-date=2007-03-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916101255/http://chicago.about.com/cs/history/a/05_great_fire.htm |archive-date=2007-09-16}}</ref> Though the assets of the ''Journal'' were sold to the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' in 1929, its last owner Samuel Emory Thomason also immediately launched the tabloid ''Chicago Daily Illustrated Times''.<ref name="CHS"/>

The modern paper grew out of the 1948 merger of the ''Chicago Sun'', founded by [[Marshall Field III]] on December 4, 1941, and the ''[[Chicago Daily Times]]'' (which had dropped the "Illustrated" from its title). The newspaper was owned by [[Field Enterprises]], controlled by the [[Marshall Field family]], which acquired the afternoon ''Chicago Daily News'' in 1959 and launched [[WFLD]] television in 1966. When the ''Daily News'' ended its run in 1978, much of its staff, including Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist [[Mike Royko]], were moved to the ''Sun-Times''. During the Field period, the newspaper had a populist, progressive character that leaned [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] but was independent of the city's Democratic establishment. Although the graphic style was urban tabloid, the paper was well regarded for journalistic quality and did not rely on sensational front-page stories. It typically ran articles from ''[[The Washington Post]]''/''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wire service.

=== The 1940s, 1950s and 1960s ===
Among the most prominent members of the newspaper's staff was cartoonist [[Jacob Burck]], who was hired by the ''Chicago Times'' in 1938, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1941 and continued with the paper after it became the ''Sun-Times'', drawing nearly 10,000 cartoons over a 44-year career.

The advice column "Ask Ann Landers" debuted in 1943. [[Ann Landers]] was the pseudonym of staff writer Ruth Crowley, who answered readers' letters until 1955. Eppie Lederer, sister of "[[Dear Abby]]" columnist Abigail van Buren, assumed the role thereafter as Ann Landers.

"Kup's Column", written by [[Irv Kupcinet]], also made its first appearance in 1943.

[[Jack Olsen]] joined the ''Sun-Times'' as editor-in-chief in 1954, before moving on to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazines and authoring true-crime books. Hired as literary editor in 1955 was [[Hoke Norris]], who also covered the civil-rights movement for the ''Sun-Times''.

[[Jerome Holtzman]] became a member of the ''Chicago Sun'' sports department after first being a copy boy for the ''Daily News'' in the 1940s. He and [[Edgar Munzel]], another longtime sportswriter for the paper, both would end up honored by the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]].

Famed for his World War II exploits, two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist [[Bill Mauldin]] made the ''Sun-Times'' his home base in 1962. The following year, Mauldin drew one of his most renowned illustrations, depicting a mourning statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]] after the November 1963 assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]].

Two years out of college, [[Roger Ebert]] became a staff writer in 1966, and a year later was named ''Sun-Times''{{'}}s film critic. He continued in this role for the remainder of his life.

=== The 1970s ===
In 1975, a new sports editor at the ''Sun-Times'', [[Lewis Grizzard]], spiked some columns written by sportswriter [[Lacy J. Banks]] and took away a column Banks had been writing, prompting Banks to tell a friend at the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' that Grizzard was a racist.<ref name="chicagoreader1">{{cite web |last=Joravsky |first=Ben |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/lacy-banks-sun-times-cancer-health-care/Content?oid=2318368 |title=Not Going Gently &#124; Media |publisher=Chicago Reader |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref> After the friend wrote a story about it, Grizzard fired Banks. With that, the editorial employees union intervened, a federal arbitrator ruled for Banks, and 13 months later he got his job back.<ref name="chicagoreader1"/>

A 25-part series on the [[Mirage Tavern]], a saloon on Wells Street bought and operated by the ''Sun-Times'' in 1977, exposed a pattern of civic corruption and bribery, as city officials were investigated and photographed without their knowledge. The articles received considerable publicity and acclaim, but a nomination for the Pulitzer Prize met resistance from some who believed the Mirage series represented a form of entrapment.
In March 1978, the venerable afternoon publication the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', sister paper of the ''Sun-Times'', went out of business. The two newspapers shared the same ownership and office building. [[James F. Hoge, Jr.]], editor and publisher of the Daily News, assumed the same positions at the ''Sun-Times'', which also retained a number of the ''Daily News''{{'}}s editorial personnel.

=== The 1980s ===
In 1980, the ''Sun-Times'' hired syndicated TV columnist Gary Deeb away from the rival ''Chicago Tribune''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Anderson |title=TV backers taking a pass, for now, on Gary Deeb on television  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=C10 |date=June 9, 1983}}</ref> Deeb then left the ''Sun-Times'' in the spring of 1983 to try his hand at TV.  He joined Chicago's [[WLS-TV]] in September 1983.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Anderson |title=Due soon at a handsome price: Bill Kurtis' good-looking new book  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=A7 |date=September 26, 1983}}</ref>

In July 1981, prominent ''Sun-Times'' investigative reporter [[Pam Zekman]], who had been part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team with the ''Chicago Tribune'' in 1976, announced she was leaving the ''Sun-Times'' to join [[WBBM-TV]] in Chicago in August 1981 as chief of its new investigative unit.  "Salary wasn't a factor," she told the ''Tribune''.  "The station showed a commitment to investigative journalism.  It was something I wanted to try."<ref>{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Plunkett |title=People  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=B1 |date=July 26, 1981}}</ref>

[[Pete Souza]] left the ''Sun-Times'' in 1983 to become official [[White House]] photographer for President [[Ronald Reagan]] until his second term's end in 1989. Souza returned to that position to be the official photographer for President [[Barack Obama]].

Baseball writer [[Jerome Holtzman]] defected from the ''Sun-Times'' to the ''Tribune'' in late 1981, while [[Mike Downey]] also left ''Sun-Times'' sports in September 1981 to be a columnist at the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''.

In January 1984, noted ''Sun-Times'' business reporter [[James Warren (journalist)|James Warren]] quit to join the rival ''Chicago Tribune''.  He became the ''Tribune''{{'}}s Washington bureau chief and later its managing editor for features.

In 1984, Field Enterprises co-owners, half-brothers [[Marshall Field V]] and [[Ted Field]], sold the paper to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]], and the paper's style changed abruptly to mirror that of its suitemate, the ''[[New York Post]]''. Its front pages tended more to the sensational, while its political stance shifted markedly to the right. This was in the era that the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' had begun softening its traditionally staunchly Republican editorial line, blurring the city's clear division between the two newspapers' politics. This shift was made all but official when Mike Royko defected to the ''Tribune''.

Roger Ebert later reflected on the incident with disdain, stating in his blog,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2011/07/the_dirty_digger.html |title=The Dirty Digger |author=Roger Ebert |date=12 July 2011 |work=Roger Ebert's Journal |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=13 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016194504/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2011/07/the_dirty_digger.html |archive-date=16 October 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> {{cquote|On the first day of Murdoch's ownership, he walked into the newsroom and we all gathered around and he recited the usual blather and rolled up his shirtsleeves and started to lay out a new front page. Well, he was a real newspaperman, give him that. He threw out every meticulous detail of the beautiful design, ordered up big, garish headlines, and gave big play to a story about a North Shore rabbi accused of holding a sex slave.
The story turned out to be fatally flawed, but so what? It sold papers. Well, actually, it didn't sell papers. There were hundreds of cancellations. Soon our precious page 3 was defaced by a daily Wingo girl, a pinup in a bikini promoting a cash giveaway. The ''Sun-Times'', which had been placing above the ''Tribune'' in lists of the 10 best U.S. newspapers, never took that great step it was poised for.|Roger Ebert}}

Murdoch sold the paper in 1986 (to buy its former sister television station [[WFLD]] to launch the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]) for $145 million in cash in a leveraged buyout to an investor group led by the paper's publisher, Robert E. Page, and the New York investment firm Adler & Shaykin.<ref>{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Storch |title=Sun-Times sold to publisher's group  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=July 1, 1986}}</ref>

In 1984, [[Roger Simon (journalist)|Roger Simon]], who had been a ''Sun-Times'' columnist for a decade, quit to join ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', where he worked until 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creators.com/opinion/roger-simon-about.html |title=About Roger Simon, opinion columnist from Creators Syndicate |publisher=Creators.com |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref><ref name="chicagomag1">{{cite web|last=Felsenthal |first=Carol |url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/October-2011/Roger-Simon-on-Twitter-Newspapers-Roger-Ebert-and-More/ |title=Roger Simon on Twitter, Newspapers, Roger Ebert, and More |publisher=Chicagomag.com |date=2011-10-10 |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref>  Simon quit the paper because of Murdoch's purchase of it.<ref name="chicagomag1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59405.html |title=The evil of Rupert Murdoch - Roger Simon |publisher=Politico.Com |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref>  Beginning in October 1984, Simon's columns from Baltimore began appearing in the rival ''Chicago Tribune''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Simon |title=Wife fights back -- and pays for it |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=5 |date=October 14, 1984}}</ref>

In December 1986, the ''Sun-Times'' hired high-profile gossip columnist [[Michael Sneed]] away from the rival ''Chicago Tribune'', where she had been co-authoring the ''Tribune''{{'}}s own "Inc." gossip column with Kathy O'Malley.  On December 3, 1986, O'Malley led off the ''Tribune''{{'}}s "Inc." column with the heading "The Last to Know Dept." and writing, "Dontcha just hate it when you write a gossip column and people think you know all the news about what's going on and your partner gets a new job and your column still has her name on it on the very same day that her new employer announces that she's going to work for him? Yeah, INC. just hates it when that happens."<ref>{{cite news |first=Kathy |last=O'Malley |title=Oooooooops...  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=24 |date=December 3, 1986}}</ref>

In February 1987, the popular syndicated advice column "[[Ask Ann Landers]]" (commonly known as the "Ann Landers" column and written at that point by [[Eppie Lederer]]) left the ''Sun-Times'' after 31 years to jump to the rival ''Chicago Tribune'', effective March 15, 1987.<ref>{{cite news |title=Popular advice columnist Ann Landers joins Tribune  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=4 |date=February 13, 1987}}</ref>  The move sparked a nationwide hunt for a new advice columnist for the ''Sun-Times''.  After more than 12,000 responses from people aged 4 to 85, the paper ultimately hired two: [[Jeffrey Zaslow]], then a 28-year-old ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter, and [[Diane Crowley]], a 47-year-old lawyer, teacher and daughter of Ruth Crowley, who had been the original Ann Landers columnist from 1943 until 1955.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick |last=Kogan|author-link=Rick Kogan|title=Landers family feuding reignites |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=June 27, 2002}}</ref> Crowley left to return to the practice of law in 1993 and the paper decided not to renew Zaslow's contract in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|last=Joravsky |first=Ben |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/runner-up-walks-away-with-the-batof-lambs-and-rbis/Content?oid=905049 |title=Runner-Up Walks Away With the Bat/Of lambs and RBIs &#124; Media |publisher=Chicago Reader |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref>

By the summer of 1988, Page and Adler & Shaykin managing partner Leonard P. Shaykin had developed a conflict, and in August 1988, Page resigned as publisher and president and sold his interest in the paper to his fellow investors.<ref>{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Storch |title=Sun-Times publisher Page quits, sells stake  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=August 5, 1988}}</ref>

=== The 1990s ===
In mid-1991, veteran crime reporter [[Art Petacque]], who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1974, left the paper.  Almost ten years later, [[Dennis Britton]], who had been the paper's editor at the time of Petacque's retirement, told the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' that Petacque's departure, which was described at the time as a retirement, was involuntary.  "I had problems with some of the ways Art pursued his job," Britton told the ''Reader''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Joravsky |first=Ben |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-truth-still-hurts/Content?oid=905852 |title=The Truth Still Hurts &#124; Media |publisher=Chicago Reader |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref>

In September 1992, [[Bill Zwecker]] joined the ''Sun-Times'' as a gossip columnist from the troubled Lerner Newspapers suburban weekly newspaper chain, where he had written the "VIPeople" column.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kathy |last=O'Malley |author2=Dorothy Collin |title=O'Malley & Collin INC.  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=5 |date=August 9, 1992}}</ref>

In September 1992, ''Sun-Times'' sports clerk Peter Anding was arrested in the ''Sun-Times''' newsroom and held without bond after confessing to using his position to set up sexual encounters for male high school athletes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-09-27/news/9203280084_1_sexual-assault-videotaped-encounter |title=Sun-times Worker Held In Porn Case |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=27 September 1992 |access-date=2013-08-29 |first=Teresa |last=Wiltz}}</ref>  Anding was charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault and possession of child pornography.  In September 1993, Anding pleaded guilty to arranging and videotaping sexual encounters with several teenage boys and fondling others.  He was sentenced to 40 years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-09-03/news/9309030258_1_fondling-sexual-assault-encounters |title=Sentence Is 40 Years For Sports Clerk - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1993-09-03 |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref>

In 1993, the ''Sun-Times'' fired photographer Bob Black without severance for dozens of unauthorized uses of the company's [[Federal Express]] account and outside photo lab, going back more than three years and costing the company more than $1,400.<ref>{{cite web|last=Joravsky |first=Ben |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/bob-blacks-pink-slip-a-color-thingpundits-on-the-plan/Content?oid=881582 |title=Bob Black's Pink Slip: A Color Thing?/Pundits on the Plan &#124; Media |publisher=Chicago Reader |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref>  In February 1994, however, Black rejoined the paper's payroll after an arbitrator agreed with the paper's union that dismissal was too severe a penalty.<ref>{{cite web|last=Joravsky |first=Ben |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/a-writers-storya-photographers-joblincicome-in-lillehammer/Content?oid=883815 |title=A Writer's Story/A Photographer's Job/Lincicome in Lillehammer &#124; Media |publisher=Chicago Reader |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref>  At the same time, the arbitrator declined to award Black back pay.

In 1993, longtime ''Sun-Times'' reporter [[Larry Weintraub]] retired after 35 years at the paper.<ref name="chicagotribune2001">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-06-01/news/0106010307_1_chicago-sun-times-mr-weintraub-reporter-and-columnist |title=Larry Weintraub, 69 - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2001-06-01 |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref>  Weintraub had been best known for his "Weintraub's World" column, in which he worked a job and wrote about the experience.<ref name="chicagotribune2001"/>  Weintraub died in 2001 at age 69.<ref name="chicagotribune2001"/>

In February 1994, the Adler & Shaykin investor group sold the ''Sun-Times'' to [[Hollinger Inc.]] for about $180 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chicago Sun-Times is sold to a Canadian media firm  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=February 28, 1994}}</ref>  Hollinger was controlled, indirectly, by Canadian-born businessman [[Conrad Black]]. After Black and his associate [[David Radler]] were indicted for skimming money from Hollinger International, through retaining noncompete payments from the sale of Hollinger newspapers, they were removed from the board, and Hollinger International was renamed the [[Sun-Times Media Group]].

In 1994, noted reporter [[M.W. Newman]] retired from the ''Sun-Times'' around the age of 77.<ref name="chicagotribune1">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-10-26/news/0110260176_1_stories-copy-editor-words |title=M.w.

On March 23, 1995, the ''Sun-Times'' announced that beginning April 2, 1995, veteran ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Rick Telander]] would join the paper and write four columns a week.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sports Illustrated's Telander Joins Sun-Times as Columnist  |work=Chicago Sun-Times |page=98 |date=March 23, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Judy |last=Hevrdejs |author2=Mike Conklin |title=Letterman's stint as Oscar host sure to test king of cool  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=20 |date=March 23, 1995}}</ref>

On March 24, 1995, the ''Sun-Times'' published an editorial by [[Mark Hornung]], then the ''Sun-Times''' editorial page editor, that plagiarized a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' editorial that had appeared in that paper the day before.<ref>{{cite web|last=Joravsky |first=Ben |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/taking-a-page-from-the-postthe-lost-decadenews-bites/Content?oid=886941 |title=Taking a Page From the Post/The Lost Decade/News Bites &#124; Media |publisher=Chicago Reader |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref>  Hornung attributed the plagiarism to writer's block, deadline pressures and the demands of other duties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Joravsky |first=Ben |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/hornung-not-gone-and-not-forgottenhollywood-bombs-defusednews-bites/Content?oid=887376 |title=Hornung: Not Gone and Not Forgotten/Hollywood Bombs Defused/News Bites &#124; Media |publisher=Chicago Reader |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref>  He resigned as editorial page editor, but remained with the paper, shifting to its business side and working first as director of distribution and then as vice president of circulation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sun-Times Names VP of Circulation  |work=Chicago Sun-Times |page=2 |date=January 17, 1996}}</ref>  In 2002, Hornung became president and publisher of Midwest Suburban Publishing, which was a company owned by then-''Sun Times'' parent company Hollinger International.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hastings new VP-circulation for Sun-Times  |work=Chicago Sun-Times |page=52 |date=January 18, 2002}}</ref>  In June 2004, Hollinger International placed Hornung on administrative leave just two weeks after Hollinger revealed that the paper's sales figures had been inflated for several years.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Herman |title=Sun-Times circulation chief, predecessor leave posts  |work=Chicago Sun-Times |page=52 |date=June 29, 2004}}</ref>  Hornung resigned from the company four days later.<ref>{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Ludwig |title=Daily Southtown names new president |work=[[Daily Southtown]] |date=August 18, 2004}}</ref>
