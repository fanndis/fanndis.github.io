Uber was originally seen as providing a cost-saving platform that matched car owners with empty seats to customers going to the same destination—true ride-sharing. The model then evolved, with dedicated drivers taking customers wherever they wanted.<ref name="Button2019">{{cite journal|last1=Button|first1=Kenneth|title=The 'Ubernomics' of ridesourcing: the myths and the reality|journal=Transport Reviews|volume=40|issue=1|year=2019|pages=76–94|issn=0144-1647|doi=10.1080/01441647.2019.1687605|s2cid=213703773}}</ref>

Like similar companies, Uber has been criticized for treatment of drivers as [[independent contractor]]s, disruption of the [[taxicab]] business, and an increase of [[traffic congestion]]. When it was under the leadership of former [[CEO]] [[Travis Kalanick]], the company was criticized for several unethical practices.

==Product overview==

Uber does not provide transportation services but, instead, determines the terms on which independent drivers are allocated to customers and the prices that will be charged to them, including the share earned by the driver.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://prospect.org/labor/uber-s-antitrust-problem/ | title=Uber's Antitrust Problem | last=Steinbaum | first=Marshall | work=The American Prospect | date=May 11, 2016}}</ref> To facilitate the scheme, Uber utilizes [[dynamic pricing]] model; prices vary according to [[supply and demand]] at the time of service. However, customers are quoted the fare or delivery fee in advance.<ref>{{cite web | title=UberEATS – How it Works | url=https://about.ubereats.com/en/ | publisher=Uber | access-date=April 7, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603011031/https://about.ubereats.com/en/ | archive-date=June 3, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://mashable.com/2017/11/14/uber-introduces-upfront-pricing/ | title=Uber finally shows upfront pricing, following in Lyft's footsteps | first=Monica | last=Chin | work=[[Mashable]] | date=November 14, 2017 | access-date=September 8, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908164557/https://mashable.com/2017/11/14/uber-introduces-upfront-pricing/ | archive-date=September 8, 2018 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Pricing options===

====Uber’s dynamic pricing technology====

According to Uber, “in the United States, upfront prices are based on the estimated length and duration of the trip. Estimates can vary based on demand patterns and real-world factors like traffic.” Uber holds absolute control over the pricing of all trips, as well as the distribution mechanism of the supply side.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.uber.com/be/en/ride/how-it-works/upfront-pricing/ | title=Uber's upfront pricing, explained | work=Uber Technologies | access-date=September 7, 2020 }}</ref>

====Multiples of Uber’s base rates====

In January of 2020, Uber has released new test feature in select California service areas to enable drivers at the Santa Barbara, Sacramento and Palm Springs airports to set a fare based on a multiple of Uber’s base, time and distance rates for UberX and UberXL trips.<ref>{{cite news | title=Uber Tests Feature Letting Some California Drivers Set Their Own Rates |first=Matt |last=McFarland |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/21/tech/uber-california-drivers-rates/index.html | work=CNN Business | date=January 21, 2020}}</ref>

====Price fixing implications====

As part of the measure to enable drivers set multiples of the Uber’s base rates in select areas in California, Uber states in its directives to drivers that "it is illegal under state and federal law for anyone, including rideshare drivers, to engage in price fixing. This includes agreeing or coordinating with other drivers (in airport staging lots or elsewhere) on pricing and surge pricing. The law requires that drivers must make decisions about pricing and surge pricing on their own."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/san-francisco/airports/san-francisco-international | title=Information for drivers – San Francisco International Airport (SFO) | work=Uber Technologies | access-date=September 7, 2020 }}</ref> The purpose of price fixing is to coordinate pricing for mutual benefit. Price fixing is an antitrust offense that is considered “per se” unreasonable restraints of trade. The courts have reasoned that price fixing has no legitimate justification and lack any redeeming competitive purpose and should, therefore, be considered unlawful without any further analysis of their reasonableness, economic justification, or other factors.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/antitrust-resource-manual-1-attorney-generals-policy-statement | title=Archived Antitrust Resource Manual | work=U.S. Department of Justice| access-date=September 7, 2020 }}</ref>

====Pricing control by California PUC====

In California, Uber is a [[public utility]], and operates under the jurisdiction of the [[California Public Utilities Commission]]. California Public Utilities Commission regulates public utilities within its jurisdiction, including by setting rates for transportation services provided by Uber’s “partner drivers.” Uber is considered a transportation network company under state law. The [[California Supreme Court]] has ruled that the state utilities commission has jurisdiction over its rates and has been studying the ride-hailing company’s rate-setting procedures for the past seven years, but has not acted to regulate those rates or announced any intention to do so.<ref> {{cite news | title=Uber can't be sued for undercutting taxi prices, California Supreme Court says | url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Uber-can-t-be-sued-for-undercutting-taxi-15443987.php | date=July 29, 2020}}</ref>

===Service options===
UberX, the basic level of service, includes a private ride in a standard car with driver for up to four passengers. Depending on the location, Uber offers various other levels of transportation service at different prices including: black [[luxury vehicle]]s, newer or premium level vehicles, cars with leather seats, [[sport utility vehicle]]s, [[minivan]], [[van]]s, [[Suzuki Alto]]s, [[hatchback]]s, [[electric car]]s, [[hybrid vehicle]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[auto rickshaw]]s, actual [[taxicab]]s, lower-cost [[shared transport]] with other passengers going in the same general direction (suspended during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]), [[child safety seat]]s, [[pet shipping]], guaranteed [[Spanish

====Use of data====
Like many large-scale technology companies, a vast amount of data on customer behaviour are available to Uber. Economist [[John A. List]], acting as chief economist for Uber in addition to his university career, analysed company data to see the effect of customer problems and company response on future customer orders. For example, a ride might be predicted to take 9 minutes, but actually take 23 minutes. Analysis found that people with a bad experience later spent up to 10% less with Uber, a very significant loss of revenue. List then experimented with the effect of different reactions by Uber on future use of Uber. A simple "sincere apology" was made to some customers; others added an admission that the company had failed the customer, or a commitment to "ensure that this will not happen again". It was found that all forms of apology were ineffective in retaining customer support. However, if a [[US$]]5 discount voucher was offered, there was a lot less loss of business; but if there were further bad experiences, customers did not return; further apologies seemed to alienate customers further.

Data analysis found that male drivers earnt about 7% more than women; this was pinned down to men driving on average 2.5% faster, enabling them to drive more customers. Women passengers gave tips averaging 4%, while men gave 5%; but women drivers received more tips—so long as they were aged below about 65.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The man who taught Uber how to say sorry |last=Edmonds |first=David |work=BBC News |date=24 October 2020 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-54613947}}</ref>

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of Uber}}
[[File:Travis Kalanick LeWeb.jpg|thumbnail|[[Travis Kalanick]], former CEO of Uber, in 2013]]

In 2009, Uber was founded as Ubercab by [[Garrett Camp]], a computer programmer and the co-founder of [[StumbleUpon]], and [[Travis Kalanick]], who sold his [[Red Swoosh]] startup for $19 million in 2007.<ref name=innovation>{{cite news | url=https://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/richest-people/2016-garrett-camp-uber/ | title=Co-founding Uber made Calgary-born Garrett Camp a billionaire | first=Alec | last=Scott | work=[[Canadian Business]] | date=November 19, 2015}}</ref>

After Camp and his friends spent $800 hiring a private driver, he wanted to find a way to reduce the cost of direct transportation. He realized that sharing the cost with people could make it affordable, and his idea morphed into Uber. Kalanick joined Camp and gives him "full credit for the idea" of Uber.<ref name=BI-2014/> The first prototype was built by Camp and his friends, Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan, with Kalanick as the "mega advisor" to the company.<ref name=BI-2014/>

===Antitrust price fixing allegations===
Uber has been a subject of several [[antitrust]] legal cases. Antitrust law generally holds that price setting activities are permissible within business firms, but bars them beyond firm boundaries. Uber does not actually provide services to consumers directly, instead, drivers are independent contractors and not employees. The antitrust law’s firm exemption strictly applies to entities that a platform have a direct control over, such as employees. The core of Uber’s business model is the coordination of consumer prices across drivers as means to deliver upfront fares calculated by an algorithm. Uber has managed to avoid directly litigating this antitrust problem by compelling a consumer (Meyer v. Uber Technologies, Inc.) lawsuit to be moved into arbitration.<ref>{{cite web | title =The Firm Exemption and the Hierarchy of Finance in the Gig Economy | url=https://ir.stthomas.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1457&context=ustlj | first=Sanjukta | last=Paul | date=October 19, 2019 | access-date=March 3, 2020}}</ref>

In the 1951 antitrust case United States v. Richfield Oil Co., the court ruled unequivocally for the government on the grounds that Richfield Oil Co. exercised de facto control over “independent business men,” in contravention of the antitrust laws, despite the fact that they were not employees of the company. This has become the basis for delineation between the realm of labor and antitrust: if subordinate entities are “independent business men” and not [[employee]]s, it is illegal to exercise control. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the same basic principle against coercion of non-employees by [[Vertical integration|vertical supply contract]] in the 1964 case Simpson v. Union Oil Co. of California.

Microlabor [[online marketplace]]s like Uber, [[Lyft]], [[Handy (company)|Handy]], Amazon Home Services, [[DoorDash]], and [[Instacart]] have perfected a process where workers deal bilaterally with gigs whose employers have none of the standard obligations of employers, while the platform operates the entire labor market to its own benefit – what some antitrust experts call a “for-profit hiring hall.”<ref>{{cite document | title=Antitrust, the Gig Economy, and Labor Market Power | first=Marshall | last=Steinbaum | date=June 18, 2019 | ssrn=3347949 }}</ref>

Uber drivers are not employees, and hence Uber setting the terms on which they transact with customers, including fixing the prices charged to customers, constitutes a violation of the ban on restraints of trade in the [[Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890]]. The issue whether Uber is a price-fixing conspiracy, and whether that price-fixing is horizontal has yet to be resolved at trial. Uber publicly stated that: “we believe the law is on our side and that’s why in four years no anti-trust agency has raised this as an issue and there has been no similar litigation like it in the U.S.”<ref>{{cite web | title=The Legal Argument That Could Destroy Uber Is About To Be Tested | url=https://jalopnik.com/the-legal-argument-that-could-destroy-uber-is-about-to-1838255672| first=Aaron | last=Gordon | date=September 19, 2019 | access-date=March 3, 2020}}</ref>

It is unclear if Uber is less or more safe than [[taxicab]]s, as major cities don't have much data on taxi-related incidents.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/are-taxis-safer-than-uber/386207/ | title=Are Taxis Safer Than Uber? | first1=Adrienne | last1=LaFrance | first2=Rose | last2=Eveleth | work=[[The Atlantic]] | date=March 3, 2015 | access-date=June 8, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405212944/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/are-taxis-safer-than-uber/386207/ | archive-date=April 5, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

====Inadequate background checks and vetting of drivers====
Violent crimes, including [[sexual abuse]] of passengers, have been committed by both Uber drivers<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/be935fdc-e4df-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da|title=Beirut killing reignites concerns about Uber safety |date=December 19, 2017|work= Financial Times|access-date= May 11, 2019}}</ref> or by individuals posing as Uber drivers who lure unsuspecting passengers to their vehicles by placing an Uber sticker on their dashboard or by claiming to be a passenger's expected driver.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/fake-uber-driver-assaults.html| title=They Thought It Was Their Uber.

The [[2016 Kalamazoo shootings]] in February 2016, which left six people dead in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], were committed by an Uber driver. Although Uber was criticized for its background check process, the driver did not have a [[criminal record]], and the background check did not cause alarm.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/uber-driver-screening-kalamazoo-1.3459572 | title=Uber defends driver screening in wake of Kalamazoo shootings | last1=Durbin | last2=Krisher | first1=Dee-Anne | first2=Tom | agency=[[CBC News]] | date=February 23, 2016 | access-date=September 8, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726053256/https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/uber-driver-screening-kalamazoo-1.3459572 | archive-date=July 26, 2018 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In November 2017, The [[Colorado Public Utilities Commission]] fined Uber $8.9 million after discovering that 57 drivers in the state had violations in their background checks, including a conviction felon that received permission to drive for Uber by using an alias. The fine amount equaled $2,500 per day that an unqualified driver worked.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/20/technology/uber-colorado-background-checks-fine/index.html | title=Uber fined $8.9 million in Colorado for problematic background checks | last=Yurieff | first=Kaya | work=[[CNN]] | date=November 20, 2017 | access-date=September 8, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908174657/https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/20/technology/uber-colorado-background-checks-fine/index.html | archive-date=September 8, 2018 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In September 2017, Uber's application for a new license in London was rejected by [[Transport for London]] (TfL) because of the company's approach and past conduct showed a lack of corporate responsibility related to driver background checks, obtaining medical certificates and reporting serious criminal offences.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Butler |first1=Sarah |last2=Topham |first2=Gwyn |title=Uber stripped of London licence due to lack of corporate responsibility |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/22/uber-licence-transport-for-london-tfl |access-date=28 November 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 September 2017}}</ref> In November 2019, [[Transport for London]] announced it would not renew Uber's license to operate in [[London]] on the grounds that Uber had failed to adequately address issues with checks on drivers, insurance, and safety.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/25/uber-loses-licence-london-tfl |title=Uber loses licence to operate in London| website=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/business/uber-london.html |title=Uber's License to Operate in London Isn't Extended |website=[[The New York Times]]| date=November 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Uber stripped of London operating licence, again |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uber-britain-decision/uber-stripped-of-london-operating-licence-again-idUKL9N26P018 |access-date=28 November 2019 |work=Reuters |date=25 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Part of TfL's rationale for removing Uber's licence was evidence that Uber driver accounts had been used by unauthorized drivers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/uber-drivers-using-fake-identities-isnt-just-a-london-problem/| title=Some Uber drivers aren't who you think they are|last=Kerr| first=Dara |website=[[CNET]] |language=en| access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2019/november/uber-london-limited-found-to-be-not-fit-and-proper-to-hold-a-private-hire-operator-licence |title=Uber London Limited found to be not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence |website=[[Transport for London]] |language=en|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>

==Controversies under former CEO Travis Kalanick==
===Principled confrontation===
When Uber was led by [[Travis Kalanick]], the company took an aggressive strategy in dealing with obstacles, including regulators. In 2014, Kalanick said "You have to have what I call principled confrontation." Uber's strategy was generally to commence operations in a city, then, if it faced regulatory opposition, Uber mobilized public support for its service and mounted a political campaign, supported by lobbyists, to change regulations.<ref>{{cite news | title=How Uber Took Over Portland | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-06-23/this-is-how-uber-takes-over-a-city | first=Karen | last=Weise | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=June 24, 2015 | access-date=March 12, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406180819/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-06-23/this-is-how-uber-takes-over-a-city | archive-date=April 6, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=The Uber-ization of Activism | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/opinion/the-uber-ization-of-activism.html | first=Edward T. | last=Walker | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 7, 2015 | url-access=subscription | access-date=February 28, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218022220/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/opinion/the-uber-ization-of-activism.html | archive-date=December 18, 2016 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=How Sharp-Elbowed Uber Is Trying to Make Nice | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/hard-driving-uber-gives-compromise-a-try-1422588782 | first1=Douglas | last1=MacMillan | first2=Lisa | last2=Fleisher | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=January 29, 2015 | url-access=subscription | access-date=March 12, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320052630/https://www.wsj.com/articles/hard-driving-uber-gives-compromise-a-try-1422588782 | archive-date=March 20, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1835111/uber-collision-course-chinas-taxi-drivers-and-cartels | title=Uber on a collision course with China's taxi drivers and cartels | first=Robert | last=Boxwell | work=[[South China Morning Post]] | date=July 9, 2015 | access-date=September 8, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908164533/https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1835111/uber-collision-course-chinas-taxi-drivers-and-cartels | archive-date=September 8, 2018 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> For example, in June 2014, Uber sent a notice to riders with the email address and phone number of a commissioner in Virginia who opposed the company, and told riders to [[Lobbying in the United States|lobby]] the official, who received hundreds of complaints.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2014/06/06/uber-mobilizes-its-users-to-fight-ban-in-virginia/ | title=Uber mobilizes its users to fight ban in Virginia | first=Lori | last=Aratani | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=June 6, 2014 | access-date=September 9, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909185557/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2014/06/06/uber-mobilizes-its-users-to-fight-ban-in-virginia/ | archive-date=September 9, 2018 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/uber-pressures-regulators-by-mobilizing-riders-and-hiring-vast-lobbying-network/2014/12/13/3f4395c6-7f2a-11e4-9f38-95a187e4c1f7_story.html | title=Uber pressures regulators by mobilizing riders and hiring vast lobbying network | first=Rosalind S. | last=Helderman | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=December 13, 2014 | access-date=September 8, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908170015/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/uber-pressures-regulators-by-mobilizing-riders-and-hiring-vast-lobbying-network/2014/12/13/3f4395c6-7f2a-11e4-9f38-95a187e4c1f7_story.html | archive-date=September 8, 2018 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> In November 2017, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi dropped the "win at all costs" strategy and implemented new values for the company, including "we do the right thing".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/07/technology/uber-do-the-right-thing/index.html | title=New from Uber: 'We do the right thing.

===Alleged cancellation of ride requests to disrupt competitors===
Uber issued an apology on January 24, 2014 after documents were leaked to [[Valleywag]] and [[TechCrunch]] saying that, earlier in the month, Uber employees in New York City deliberately ordered rides from [[Gett]], a competitor, only to cancel them later. The purpose of the fake orders was two-fold: wasting drivers' time to obstruct legitimate customers from securing a car, and offering drivers incentives{{snd}}including cash{{snd}}to join Uber.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/24/5342582/uber-employees-spammed-competing-car-service-with-fake-orders | title=Uber employees spammed competing car service with fake orders | first=Dante | last=D'Orazio | work=[[The Verge]] | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | date=January 24, 2014 | access-date=September 17, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210071528/https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/24/5342582/uber-employees-spammed-competing-car-service-with-fake-orders | archive-date=December 10, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

====SLOG plan to disrupt Lyft====
Following [[Lyft]]'s expansion into New York City in July 2014, Uber, with the assistance of TargetCW, sent emails offering a "huge commission opportunity" to several contractors based on the "personal hustle" of the participants. Those who responded to the solicitation were offered a meeting with Uber marketing managers who attempted to create a "street team" to gather intelligence about Lyft's launch plans in New York City and recruit their drivers to Uber. Recruits were given two Uber-branded [[iPhone]]s (one a backup in case the person was identified by Lyft) and a series of valid credit card numbers to create dummy Lyft accounts. Participants were also required to sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/26/6067663/this-is-ubers-playbook-for-sabotaging-lyft | title=This is Uber's playbook for sabotaging Lyft | first=Casey | last=Newton | work=[[The Verge]] | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | date=August 26, 2014 | access-date=September 17, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902140845/https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/26/6067663/this-is-ubers-playbook-for-sabotaging-lyft | archive-date=September 2, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/ubers-operation-slog-against-lyft-2014-8 | title=OperationSLOG: Uber's Aggressive Plan To Steal Lyft Drivers, Revealed | first=Alyson | last=Shontell | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=August 26, 2014 | access-date=September 9, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909184859/https://www.businessinsider.com/ubers-operation-slog-against-lyft-2014-8 | archive-date=September 9, 2018 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In August 2014, [[Lyft]] reported that 177 Uber employees had ordered and canceled approximately 5,560 Lyft rides since October 2013, and that it had found links to Uber recruiters by cross-referencing the phone numbers involved. The report identified one Lyft passenger who canceled 300 rides from May 26 to June 10, 2014, and who was identified as an Uber recruiter by seven different Lyft drivers. Uber did not apologize, but suggested that the recruitment attempts were possibly independent parties trying to make money.<ref>{{cite web | title=Uber's dirty tricks quantified: Rival counts 5,560 canceled rides | url=https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/11/technology/uber-fake-ride-requests-lyft/index.html | first=Erica | last=Fink | website=[[CNN Business]] | date=August 12, 2014 | access-date=September 8, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908164922/https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/11/technology/uber-fake-ride-requests-lyft/index.html | archive-date=September 8, 2018 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Uber accused of booking 5,560 fake Lyft rides | url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5994077/uber-cancellation-accusations | first=Cassandra | last=Khaw | work=[[The Verge]] | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | date=August 12, 2014 | access-date=September 17, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119072153/https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5994077/uber-cancellation-accusations | archive-date=November 19, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2017, lawyers for drivers filed a [[class action]] lawsuit that alleged that Uber did not provide drivers with the 80% of collections they were entitled to.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-uber-class-action-20180219-story.html | title=Uber class-action lawsuit over how drivers were paid gets green light from judge | first=Tracey| last=Lien | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 19, 2018 | url-access=subscription | access-date=January 13, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113232559/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-uber-class-action-20180219-story.html | archive-date=January 13, 2019 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In May 2017, after the New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) filed a class action lawsuit in federal court in New York, Uber admitted to underpaying New York City drivers tens of millions of dollars over 2.5 years by calculating driver commissions on a net amount. Uber agreed to pay the amounts owed plus interest.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/23/uber-underpaid-drivers-new-york-city | title=Uber admits underpaying New York City drivers by millions of dollars | first=Julia Carrie | last=Wong | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=May 23, 2017 | access-date=January 13, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109121055/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/23/uber-underpaid-drivers-new-york-city | archive-date=January 9, 2019 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Evasion of law enforcement operations===
====Greyball====
Starting in 2014, Uber used an internal software tool it developed called [[Greyball]], which uses data collected from the Uber mobile app and other means, to avoid giving rides to certain individuals. By showing "ghost cars" driven by fake drivers to the targeted individuals in the Uber mobile app, and by giving real drivers a means to cancel rides requested by those individuals, Uber was able to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service is illegal. [[Investigative journalism]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the resulting report, published on March 3, 2017, made public Uber's use of Greyball since 2014, describing it as a way to evade city code enforcement officials in [[Portland, Oregon]], Australia, South Korea, and China.<ref name=nyt_greyball>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html | first=Mike | last=Isaac | title=How Uber Deceives the Authorities Worldwide | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 3, 2017 | access-date=March 5, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305054555/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html | archive-date=March 5, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> At first, in response to the report, Uber stated that Greyball was designed to deny rides to users who violate Uber's [[terms of service]], including those involved in [[sting operation]]s.<ref name=nyt_greyball/><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/blue-sky/ct-uber-greyball-20170303-story.html | title=Uber's secret 'Greyball' program shows just how far it will go to get its way | first1=Craig | last1=Timberg | first2=Brian | last2=Fung | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=March 3, 2017 | url-access=subscription | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430185631/http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-uber-greyball-20170303-story.html | archive-date=April 30, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> According to Uber, Greyball can "hide the standard city app view for individual riders, enabling Uber to show that same rider a different version".

An announcement in November 2017 revealed that in 2016, a separate data breach had disclosed the personal information of 600,000 drivers and 57 million customers. This data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and drivers' license information. Hackers used employees' usernames and passwords that had been compromised in previous breaches (a "[[credential stuffing]]" method) to gained access to a private [[GitHub]] repository used by Uber's developers. The hackers located credentials for the company's [[Amazon Web Services]] datastore in the repository files, and were able to obtain access to the account records of users and drivers, as well as other data contained in over 100 [[Amazon S3]] buckets. Uber paid a $100,000 ransom to the hackers on the promise they would delete the stolen data.<ref>{{cite news | last=Lee | first=Dave | title=Uber concealed huge data breach | work=[[BBC News]] |
