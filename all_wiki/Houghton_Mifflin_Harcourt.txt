Houghton Mifflin. Archived from the original on December 13, 2007.</ref> '''HMH''') is a [[publisher]] of [[textbook]]s, instructional technology materials, assessments, [[reference work]]s, and fiction and non-fiction for both young readers and adults.

The company is based in [[Boston]]'s [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]]. It was formerly known as '''Houghton Mifflin Company''' and changed its name following the 2007 acquisition of [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Publishing]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=279374 |title=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company: Private Company Information – Businessweek|work=investing.businessweek.com|access-date=April 23, 2012}}</ref> Prior to March 2010, it was a subsidiary of [[EMPG|Education Media and Publishing Group]] Limited, an Irish-owned holding company registered in the [[Cayman Islands]] and formerly known as [[Riverdeep]].

==History==
[[File:Hmif.jpg|thumb|right|Houghton Mifflin Harcourt at 222 Berkeley Street, Boston, Massachusetts]]

In 1832, [[William Ticknor]] and John Allen purchased a bookselling business in Boston and began to involve themselves in publishing. [[James Thomas Fields]] joined as a partner in 1843, and with Ticknor gradually gathered an impressive list of writers, including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Winship  |first=Michael |date=1995 |title=American Literary Publishing in the Mid-Nineteenth Century: The Business of Ticknor and Fields |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=15–17, 20–21 |isbn=0521454697}}</ref> The duo formed a close relationship with Riverside Press, a [[Boston]] printing company owned by [[Henry Oscar Houghton]]. Houghton also founded his own publishing company with partner Melancthon Hurd in 1864, with George Mifflin joining the partnership in 1872.{{sfn|Ballou|1970|pp=55, 131}}

In 1878, [[Ticknor and Fields]], now under the leadership of [[James R. Osgood]], found itself in financial difficulties and merged its operations with Hurd and Houghton. The new partnership, named Houghton, Osgood and Company, held the rights to the [[literature|literary]] works of both publishers.{{sfn|Winship|1995|pp=22-23}} When Osgood left the firm two years later, the business reemerged as Houghton, Mifflin and Company. Despite a lucrative partnership with Lawson Valentine, Houghton, Mifflin and Company still had debt it had inherited from Ticknor and Fields, so it decided to add partners. In 1884, James D. Hurd, the son of Melancthon Hurd, became a partner. In 1888, three others became partners as well: James Murray Kay, Thurlow Weed Barnes, and Henry Oscar Houghton Jr.{{sfn|Ballou|1970|pp=276-278, 303-304}}

Shortly thereafter, the company established an Educational Department, and from 1891 to 1908, sales of educational materials increased by 500 percent. The firm incorporated in 1908, changing its name to Houghton Mifflin Company.{{sfn|Ballou|1970|pp=494-495}} Soon after 1916, Houghton Mifflin became involved in publishing [[standardized test]]s and testing materials, working closely with such test developers as E. F. Lindquist. By 1921, the company was the fourth-largest educational publisher in the United States.

In 1961, Houghton Mifflin famously passed on Julia Child's ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]'', giving it up to [[Alfred A. Knopf]] who published it in 1962. It became an overnight success and is considered by many to be the bible of French cooking. Houghton Mifflin's strategic error was depicted in the 2009 film ''[[Julie & Julia]]''.{{unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}

In 1967, Houghton Mifflin became a publicly traded company on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the stock symbol {{mono|HTN}}. In 1979, Houghton Mifflin acquired Clarion Books, the children's division of [[Seabury Press]].<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Lask| first = Thomas| title = A 'Memoir' of Gandhi By Shirer Due in 1980| work = The New York Times| access-date = 2019-04-02| date = 1979-06-14| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/14/archives/a-memoir-of-gandhi-by-shirer-due-in-1980-new-encyclopedia-houghton.html}}</ref>

In 1998, HMH announced a sub-brand called LOGAL Software, which was to release a new line of interactive science software called ''[[Science Gateways]]'', to support the United States curriculum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/logal-software-inc-to-debut-science-gateways-product-line-78061512.html|title=LOGAL Software, Inc. to Debut Science Gateways Product Line|last=Ltd.|first=LOGAL Educational Software &amp; Systems|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref> As of 2017, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is offering the "Logal Science" brand as a licensing opportunity on its website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmhco.com/at-home/featured-shops/the-learning-company/licensing-opportunities|title=Licensing Opportunities|website=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref>

In 2017, it was announced that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt would be getting involved in TV production with a planned 2019 Netflix series that will revive the [[Carmen Sandiego]] franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/carmen-sandiego-new-animated-series-coming-to-netflix-in-2019|title='Carmen Sandiego,' New Animated Series, Coming to Netflix in 2019|website=Netflix Media Center|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}</ref>

===Creation of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt===
[[Mergers and acquisitions]] (M&A) activities have had major effects on this company.

====Vivendi purchase====
In 2001, Houghton Mifflin was acquired by French media giant [[Vivendi Universal]] for $2.2 billion including assumed debt. Vivendi Universal already owned the British children's publisher Kingfisher, which became a Houghton Mifflin imprint.<ref>{{Cite web| title = HM Absorbs Kingfisher| work = PublishersWeekly.com| access-date = 2019-11-29| url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20011210/20910-hm-absorbs-kingfisher.html}}</ref> In 2002, facing mounting financial and legal pressures, Vivendi sold Houghton to [[private equity]] investors [[Thomas H. Lee Partners]], [[Bain Capital]], and [[Blackstone Group]] for $1.66 billion, including assumed debt (approximately 25% less than Vivendi had paid a year earlier).<ref>SUZANNE KAPNER AND ANDREW ROSS SORKIN.

[[New York Times]], January 1, 2003.</ref>

====Riverdeep merger with Houghton Mifflin====
On December 22, 2006, it was announced that [[Riverdeep|Riverdeep PLC]] had completed its acquisition of Houghton Mifflin. The new joint enterprise would be called the Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep Group. Riverdeep paid $1.75 billion in cash and assumed $1.61 billion in debt from the private investment firms Thomas H. Lee Partners, Bain Capital and Blackstone Group.<ref>[http://www.bookdownloading.com/article/detail/irish-company-completes-houghton-mifflin-acquisition/ "Irish company completes Houghton Mifflin acquisition"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909143218/http://www.bookdownloading.com/article/detail/irish-company-completes-houghton-mifflin-acquisition/ |date=September 9, 2015 }}, Bookdownloading.com, December 22, 2006.</ref> Tony Lucki, a former non-executive director of Riverdeep, remained in his position as the company's chief executive officer until April 2009.<ref>Edgecliffe-Johnson, Andrew and Peter Smith.

Houghton Mifflin sold its professional testing unit, Promissor, to [[Pearson plc]] in 2006. The company combined its remaining assessment products within Riverside Publishing, including San Francisco-based [[Edusoft]].

====Harcourt merger====
On July 16, 2007, Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire the [[Harcourt Education]], Harcourt Trade and Greenwood-Heinemann divisions of [[Reed Elsevier]] for $4 billion. The expanded company would become Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. McDougal Littell was merged with Harcourt's Holt, Rinehart & Winston to form [[Holt McDougal]].

In October 2007, Houghton Mifflin sold Kingfisher to [[Macmillan Publishers]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Macmillan Acquires Kingfisher| work = PublishersWeekly.com| access-date = 2019-11-29| url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/17526-macmillan-acquires-kingfisher.html}}</ref>

On December 3, 2007, [[Cengage Learning]] (formerly Thomson Learning) announced that it had agreed to acquire the assets of the Houghton Mifflin College Division for $750 million, pending regulatory approval.

On November 25, 2008, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced a temporary freeze on acquisition of new trade division titles, allegedly in response to the [[economic crisis of 2008]].<ref>Trachtenberg, Jeffrey A.

===Houghton Mifflin Harcourt restructuring===
On July 27, 2009, the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' newspaper reported that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's controlling shareholder [[EMPG]] was in the process of a re-structuring negotiations with its unsecured-debt holders that would lead to the conversion of the debt into equity. The news story reported that the unsecured debt holders would receive a 45% equity stake. As a result, the royal family of Dubai via their [[Istithmar World]] Capital investment vehicle became major stakeholders.<ref name="Dubai's royal family to buy up stake in EMPG">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/world/dubais-royal-family-to-buy-up-stake-in-empg-1843677.html |title=Dubai's royal family to buy up stake in EMPG |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=July 28, 2009 |access-date=2013-08-18}}</ref> Estimates were that EMPG would cut its debt from $7.3bn to $6.1bn. On August 15, 2009, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported in an interview with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's CEO at the time, Barry O'Callaghan, that the refinancing had received approval of more than 90% of lenders. The terms included the holding company debt converting into 45% of the fully diluted common equity, an effective 25 per cent relaxation of financial covenants, second lien lenders agreeing to convert their holdings into a PIK instrument, reducing annual interest costs by $100m, and a further $50m increase its working capital facility.<ref name="EMPG refinancing will cut $7.6bn debt">{{cite web|last=Edgecliffe |first=Andrew |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/defa4846-8933-11de-b50f-00144feabdc0.html |title=EMPG refinancing will cut $7.6bn debt |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=August 15, 2009 |access-date=2013-08-18}}</ref>

===Recapitalization in 2010===
On February 22, 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that EMPG and HMH had reached an agreement to restructure the finances of the company and recapitalize its balance sheet with a substantial fresh cash investment by institutional investors.<ref name="Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Secures New $650-Million Cash Investment and Recapitalizes Balance Sheet in Historic Restructuring">{{cite web |url=http://www.bookdownloading.com/article/detail/houghton-mifflin-harcourt-secures-new-650-million-cash-investment-and-recapitalizes-balance-sheet-in-historic-restructuring/ |title=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Secures New $650-Million Cash Investment and Recapitalizes Balance Sheet in Historic Restructuring |publisher=Bookdownloading.com |access-date=2015-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909151521/http://www.bookdownloading.com/article/detail/houghton-mifflin-harcourt-secures-new-650-million-cash-investment-and-recapitalizes-balance-sheet-in-historic-restructuring/ |archive-date=September 9, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The agreement, supported by 100% of HMH's creditors, highlighted a reduction in the senior debt to $3 billion from the current $5 billion, with new equity issued to the senior debt holders (including [[Paulson & Co.]] and [[Guggenheim Partners]]),<ref name="Houghton Owner Restructures Debt">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704454304575081652306551196 |title=Houghton Mifflin Parent Company Restructures Debt - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=February 23, 2010 |access-date=2013-08-18}}</ref> conversion of the $2 billion mezzanine debt into equity and warrant, receipt of $650m of new cash from the sale of new equity.
