The '''''Philippine Daily Inquirer''''', popularly known as the '''''Inquirer''''', is  an [[English language|English-language]] [[newspaper]] in the [[Philippines]]. Founded in 1985, it is often regarded as the Philippines' [[newspaper of record]].<ref name="manilatimes">{{cite web|title=Actor-politicians and understanding the vote of the poor|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/actor-politicians-and-understanding-the-vote-of-the-poor/109589/|website=[[The Manila Times]]|date=July 6, 2014|access-date=April 25, 2018}}</ref><ref name="claudio">{{cite web|last1=Claudio|first1=Leloy|title=Reform the country's 'paper of record|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/359984/opinion/reform-the-country-s-paper-of-record|website=[[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News]]|date=May 7, 2014|access-date=April 25, 2018}}</ref>

==History==
The ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'' was a daily newspaper founded on 9 December 1985 by publisher [[Eugenia Apóstol]], columnist [[Max Solivén]], together with [[Betty Go-Belmonte]] during the last days of the regime of the Philippine dictator, [[Ferdinand Marcos]], becoming one of the first private newspapers to be established under the [[Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos regime]].<ref name=PDI>{{cite news |url=http://inquirer.dqs.com.ph/index.php/about-us/history |title=History |newspaper=The Philippine Daily Inquirer  |access-date=6 May 2013}}</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PDI's 1st Day Issue.jpg|200px|thumb|left|First issue of ''Inquirer'', December 9, 1985]] -->
The ''Inquirer'' succeeded the weekly ''Philippine Inquirer'',<ref name=PDI/> created in 1985 by Apostol to cover the trial of 25 soldiers accused of complicity in the [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.|assassination]] of opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]] at the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|Manila International Airport]] on August 21, 1983. Apostol also published the ''Mr & Ms Special Edition'', a weekly tabloid opposed to the Marcos regime.<ref name=PDI/>

===Beltran years (1985–89)===
As the successor to the previous ''Mr. and Mrs. Special Edition'' and the weekly ''Philippine Inquirer'', it was founded on a budget of P1 million and enjoyed a daily circulation of 30,000 in its early days. The new daily was housed in the dilapidated one-story Star Building on 13th and Railroad streets in Port Area, [[Manila]]. It was put out by 40 editors, reporters, correspondents, photographers and other editorial employees working in a 100 square meter newsroom. Columnist [[Louie Beltran]] was named its [[editor-in-chief]].

The newspaper was instrumental then in documenting the campaign of [[Corazon Aquino]] during the [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986 presidential elections]] and, in turn, the [[People Power Revolution|1986 People Power Revolution]]. Its slogan, ''Balanced News, Fearless Views'', was incorporated to the newspaper in January 1986 after a slogan-making contest held during the first month of the ''Inquirer's'' existence.<ref name=PDI/> In this period, the newspaper reached a high circulation of 500,000 copies a day.

In July 1986, questions about finances and a divergence of priorities caused a rift among the founders which led Belmonte, Soliven, and Art Borjal's split from the Inquirer to establish ''[[The Philippine Star]]''.<ref name=Beginnings>{{cite news |url=http://www.philstar.com/supplements/710349/beginnings-philippine-star |title=The beginnings of The Philippine Star  |first=Doreen |last=Yu |newspaper=The Philippine Star |date=28 July 2011 |access-date=6 May 2014}}</ref> As Belmonte owned the Star Building where the Inquirer was headquartered, the newspaper amicably transferred to the Soliven-owned BF Condominium in Aduana Street, [[Intramuros]].<ref name="Beginnings"/>

===Pascual years (1989–91)===
In February 1987, Federico D. Pascual, former assistant managing editor of the ''Daily Express'', was named executive editor of Inquirer and was appointed [[editor-in-chief]] two years later.<ref name=PDI/> It was during his term in 1990 that the ''Inquirer'' took the lead from the ''[[Manila Bulletin]]'' to become the Philippines' largest newspaper in terms of circulation.

However, in July 1990, the Inquirer headquarters in Intramuros was damaged by the [[1990 Luzon earthquake]]. On January 5, 1991, the newspaper transferred to the YIC building along United Nations Avenue and Romualdez Street in Malate.

===Jimenez-Magsanoc years (1991–2015)===

[[File:Letty Jimenez Magsanoc.png|150px|thumb|[[Letty Jimenez Magsanoc]], ''Inquirer'''s [[editor-in-chief]] from 1991 until her death in 2015.]]
''Inquirer's'' longest-serving and first woman [[editor-in-chief]], the late Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheridanprasso.com/stars-Letty_Jimenez.htm |title=Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc: Stars of Asia-Opinion Shapers |publisher=Sheridan Prasso |date=3 July 2000 |access-date=18 May 2014}}</ref> was appointed on June 14, 1991. She was a former columnist and editor of the "Panorama" Sunday magazine of ''[[Bulletin Today]] (now Manila Bulletin)'' who was sacked for writing articles poking fun at Marcos. She edited ''[[Mr & Ms Special Edition]]'' until the fall of the Marcos regime. She is also the first editor in chief of Sunday Inquirer Magazine.<ref name="Nery">{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/750024/magsanoc-who-led-the-inquirer-for-24-years-writes-30|title=Magsanoc, who led the Inquirer for 24 years, writes 30|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|last=Nery|first=John|date=25 November 2015|access-date=25 December 2015}}</ref>

Under her term, in 1995, the ''Inquirer'' moved to its current headquarters in [[Makati]] after transferring headquarters four times.

During the administration of president [[Joseph Estrada]], he criticized the ''Inquirer'' for "bias, malice, and fabrication" against him—this charge to the newspaper was denied. In 1999, several government organizations, pro-Estrada businesses, and movie producers simultaneously pulled their advertisements from the ''Inquirer'' in a boycott that lasted for five months.<ref name=inquirer>{{cite news|first=Cynthia D.|last=Balana|title=Isagani Yambot: PDI grammar cop, pillar of free press, friend |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/155727/isagani-yambot-pdi-grammar-cop-pillar-of-free-press-friend |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2012-03-04 |access-date=2012-03-05}}</ref> [[Malacañang Palace]] was widely implicated in the advertising boycott, which was denounced by then publisher [[Isagani Yambot]] as an attack on the [[freedom of the press]].<ref name=inquirer/>

In 2007, according to the survey conducted by AGB Nielsen, the ''Inquirer'' was the most widely-read newspaper in the Philippines. ''[[The Manila Bulletin]]'' and ''The Philippine Star'' followed as the second and the third most widely read papers, respectively. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Magsanoc died on December 24, 2015 at [[St. Luke's Medical Center]] in [[Taguig]].<ref name="Nery"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/117033-inquirer-editor-chief-letty-jimenez-magsanoc-dead|title=Inquirer editor in chief Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc dies}}</ref> A month after her death, Jimenez-Magsanoc was recognized as the Filipino of the Year 2015 by the Inquirer.

===Nolasco years (2016–present)===
On February 2, 2016, the Inquirer appointed its managing editor Jose Ma. Nolasco as the executive editor, the new top position of the newspaper, replacing the traditional editor-in-chief position that used by Inquirer for more than three decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/760953/nolasco-appointed-pdi-executive-editor|title=Nolasco appointed PDI executive editor|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref>

Nolasco was the managing editor of the ''Inquirer'' for 24 years, and he is part of the first batch of reporters of the ''Inquirer'' when the paper started its publication in 1985.

On October 6, 2016, the Inquirer launched a "rethink" of its print and digital presence by overhauling its newspaper design and website, Inquirer.net and the launch of "My Inquirer" which converged the platforms of Inquirer in print, desktop, smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch. The redesign was done in collaboration with Dr. Mario Garcia of Garcia Media.

==Filipino of the Year==
The ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'' annually names a ''Filipino of the Year'', honoring a Filipino who has made the most positive impact on the life of the nation.<ref>''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', 28 January 2007, p. 1</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/565887/history-of-the-filipino-of-the-year-award|title=History of the Filipino of the Year award|date=19 January 2014|access-date=25 December 2015}}</ref>
