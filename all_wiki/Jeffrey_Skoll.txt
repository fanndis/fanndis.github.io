'''Jeffrey Stuart Skoll,''' [[Order of Canada|OC]] (born January 16, 1965)<ref name=":1"/> is a Canadian engineer, billionaire [[internet entrepreneur]] and [[film producer]]. He was the first employee and subsequently first president of [[eBay]], eventually using the wealth this gave him to become a philanthropist, particularly through the [[Skoll Foundation]], and his media company [[Participant Media]]. He founded an investment firm, Capricorn Investment Group, soon after and currently serves as its chairman. Born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], he graduated from [[University of Toronto]] in 1987 and left Canada to attend [[Stanford University]]'s [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|business school]] in 1993.

Shortly after graduating from business school, he began his career at eBay where he wrote the [[business plan]] that the company followed from its emergence as a start-up to a larger company. While at the company he began the eBay Foundation which was allocated pre-IPO stock now worth $32 million.  Once eBay's second largest stockholder, behind Omidyar, he subsequently cashed out a portion of his company holdings, yielding him around $2 billion.<ref name="telegraph" /><ref name=":0" /> With an estimated net worth of $US 4 billion (as of December 2016), Skoll was ranked by [[Forbes]] as the 7th wealthiest Canadian and 134th in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/jeffrey-skoll/|title=Jeffrey Skoll|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2016-12-28}}</ref>

Through his film production company, [[Participant Media]]–of which he is founder, owner, and chairman–he has produced numerous critically acclaimed films. His first films ''[[Syriana]]'' (2005), ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' (2005), and ''[[North Country (film)|North Country]]'' (2005), along with the documentary ''[[Murderball (film)|Murderball]]'' (2005), accounted for 11 Oscar nominations in 2006. His subsequent films have included ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' (2006), ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'' (2006), ''[[The World According to Sesame Street]]'' (2006),  ''[[Waiting for "Superman"]]'' (2010), ''[[Lincoln (2012 film)|Lincoln]]'' (2012), and his latest, ''[[Spotlight (film)|Spotlight]]'' (2015) won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2016.<ref name=":2">[http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/oscar-nominations-are-not-goal-participant-media-ceo "Oscar nominations are not the goal: Participant Media CEO"], ''[[Marketplace]]'', February 21, 2013.

== Early life ==
Jeff Skoll was born to a [[Canadian Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada.<ref>''[http://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3359295,00.html Calcalist.co.il]''</ref><ref>[http://www.thocp.net/biographies/skoll_jeff.htm Biography], ,The History of Computing Project</ref><ref>[https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-said-jews-run-hollywood/ Times of Israel: "Who said Jews run Hollywood? -Inaugural list of 100 prominent players in Tinseltown shows a lack of diversity -- and a whole lot of MOTs" by Lisa Klug] 23 June 2016</ref> His mother was a teacher<ref name=telegraph>"The thinking man's movie mogul", ''Telegraph Magazine'' 26 August 2006</ref> and his father was a chemical company owner who sold industrial chemicals.<ref>Cohen, Adam, [http://www.twbookmark.com/books/51/0316164933/chapter_excerpt16883.html ''The Perfect Store: Inside Ebay''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630123157/http://www.twbookmark.com/books/51/0316164933/chapter_excerpt16883.html |date=2006-06-30 }}, {{ISBN|0-316-16493-3}}</ref> The family settled in [[Toronto]] in the late seventies. When Skoll was fourteen, his father was diagnosed with [[cancer]] which prompted him to discuss with his son how much he regretted not having had the time to do everything he had planned in life. His first job was pumping gas at a York Mills gas station.

He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Applied Science|BASc]] with honours in 1987 from the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[electrical engineering]] program. While an undergraduate student, he co-edited the engineering students' satirical newspaper ''The Toike Oike.'' He paid his way through college by pumping gas in [[North York]], [[Ontario]]. After graduating he backpacked around the world for several months before returning and founding two businesses in Toronto: Skoll Engineering, an [[information technology]] consulting firm and Micros on the Move Ltd., a computer rental firm. He left Canada in 1993 to earn a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree at [[Stanford Business School]], graduating in 1995. After Stanford he went to work at [[Knight-Ridder]] where he was working on internet projects for the publishing company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://skoll.org/about/meet-jeff-skoll/|title=Skoll {{!}} Meet Jeff Skoll|website=skoll.org|access-date=2016-12-26}}</ref>

== Skoll's eBay era ==
{{Further|eBay}}
In 1996 Skoll met [[eBay]]'s founder [[Pierre Omidyar]], who hired him as the company's first president and first full-time employee. While eBay was already profitable at the time Skoll joined, he wrote the [[business plan]] that eBay followed from its emergence as a start-up to a great success. He remained President until the arrival of [[Meg Whitman]] in January 1998 when he became [[vice president]], Strategic Planning and Analysis until back problems necessitated his departure from full-time employment at the company. In 1998, he championed the creation of the eBay Foundation, which was allocated pre-IPO stock now worth $32 million.  Once eBay's second largest stockholder, behind Omidyar, he subsequently cashed out a portion of his company holdings, yielding him around $2 billion.<ref name="telegraph" /><ref name=":0">Malone, Michael S., [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.02/skoll.html "The indie movie mogul"], ''Wired'' magazine, February 2006.</ref>

In 2004, Skoll founded the company Participant to create films that increase public awareness of critical social issues and give audiences opportunities to get involved through education and social action campaigns.<ref>Chong, Rachael (September 23, 2013).

The film won the 2006 Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary. “<ref>{{Cite web|title='An Inconvenient Truth,' 10 Years Later: Al Gore, Jeff Skoll and More Dish in THR's Oral History {{!}} Hollywood Reporter|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/an-inconvenient-truth-10-years-894691|access-date=2020-11-19|website=www.hollywoodreporter.com}}</ref> I would never have predicted that a film like ''An Inconvenient Truth'' would impact so many people,” Skoll told Philanthropy Roundtable.<ref name=":3" />

The Financial Times reported in 2009 that Participant allows Skoll to "pursue social and political causes through a mass medium. From modest beginnings, the company (which Skoll chairs, supported by a team of executives) is now a serious player."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Subscribe to read {{!}} Financial Times|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9bdfb524-56dd-11de-9a1c-00144feabdc0|access-date=2020-11-19|website=www.ft.com}}</ref> Fortune wrote the next year that Skoll's films are not typical Hollywood fare, "they tackle weighty subjects such as eco-Armageddon, petro-terrorism, education reform, and women’s rights. In short they tend to reflect Skoll’s progressive, and ultimately optimistic, worldview that shining a light on the world’s problems will inspire people to band together to bring about change on a large scale.

According to [[The Hollywood Reporter]], in 2014 Skoll funded the creation of the Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, saying at the time: "I founded Participant Media in the belief that a story well told has the power to ignite positive social change.
