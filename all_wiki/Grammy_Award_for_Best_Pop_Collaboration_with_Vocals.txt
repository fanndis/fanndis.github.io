The '''Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals''' was an honor presented at the [[Grammy Awards]], a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards,<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref> to recording artists for quality [[Pop music|pop]] songs on which singers collaborate. Awards in several categories are distributed annually  by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency  and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position."<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|title=Overview|accessdate=March 16, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>

The award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals was first presented to [[Al Green]] and [[Lyle Lovett]] at the [[37th Grammy Awards]] (1995) for the song "Funny How Time Slips Away". According to the category description guide for the [[52nd Grammy Awards]], the award was presented to artists that performed "newly recorded collaborative pop performances" that "do not normally perform together."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/PDFs/Recording_Academy/52guide.pdf |title=52nd OEP Category Description Guide |accessdate=February 2, 2011 |page=3 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027172820/http://www.grammy.com/PDFs/Recording_Academy/52guide.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref>

In [[39th Grammy Awards|1997]], the father-daughter duo of [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Natalie Cole]] won the award for "[[When I Fall in Love]]", a "virtual duet" remake of one of his signature hits, using a recording of his vocals more than 30 years after his death in 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/natalie-cole-singer-who-performed-the-first-virtual-duets-with-her-late-father-nat-king-cole-a6794906.html|title=Natalie Cole, a singer who performed the first 'virtual duets' with her late father Nat 'King' Cole - obituary|date=2016-01-03|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>

There have been five instances in which an artist was nominated for more than one song in the same year, with different collaborators. In [[40th Grammy Awards|1998]], [[Barbra Streisand]] received nominations for the songs "[[I Finally Found Someone]]" (with [[Bryan Adams]]) and "[[Tell Him (Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion song)|Tell Him]]" (with [[Celine Dion]]). [[Santana (band)|Santana]] was nominated in [[42nd Grammy Awards|2000]] for the songs "Love of My Life" (with [[Dave Matthews]]) and "[[Smooth (Santana song)|Smooth]]" (with [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]]). In [[44th Grammy Awards|2002]], [[Christina Aguilera]] was nominated for the songs "[[Nobody Wants to Be Lonely]]" ([[Ricky Martin]]) and "[[Lady Marmalade]]" (with [[Lil' Kim]], [[Mýa]] and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]). In [[47th Grammy Awards|2005]], [[Ray Charles]] earned nominations for the songs "[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]]" (with [[Elton John]]) and "Here We Go Again" (with [[Norah Jones]]). In [[52nd Grammy Awards|2010]], [[Colbie Caillat]] was nominated for the songs "[[Breathe (Taylor Swift song)|Breathe]]" (with [[Taylor Swift]]) and "[[Lucky (Jason Mraz song)|Lucky]]" (with [[Jason Mraz]]). Four of the five won the award with one of their two nominations (Santana's "Smooth"; Aguilera's "Lady Marmalade"; Charles's "Here We Go Again"; and Caillat's "Lucky").

Two-time award recipients include [[Van Morrison]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], Santana, [[Alison Krauss]], and [[Robert Plant]]. Krauss and Plant are the only duo to win more than once, as well as the only consecutive winners. Christina Aguilera and [[Stevie Wonder]] share the record for the most nominations, with six each.

The award was discontinued in 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. At that point, all duo or group performances in the pop category were shifted to the newly formed [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] category. The 2011 award for a cover version of "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" was the last one to be awarded in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/files/pages/category_final.pdf|title=Awards Category Comparison Chart|accessdate=April 8, 2011|page=1|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences}}</ref>
