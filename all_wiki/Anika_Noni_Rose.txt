Rose's big Broadway break was getting cast as Emmie Thibodeaux in ''[[Caroline, or Change]]''. In 2004, she was awarded the Theatre World Award, the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Featured Actress, and the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical]] for ''Caroline, or Change''.

===''The Princess and the Frog''===
Anika Noni Rose is best known for her role in [[Disney]]'s 2009 animated feature ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', as the voice of the lead character [[Princess Tiana|Tiana]]; the character is Disney's first African-American princess. Rose also said at the time, “Not only is [Tiana] the first black princess, she’s the first American princess. So, the scope and the significance is larger than people even realize.”<ref>{{cite news|url=https://people.com/movies/meet-anika-noni-rose-disneys-first-animated-black-princess/|title=Meet Anika Noni Rose: Disney's First Animated Black Princess}}</ref> Rose added that she hoped her role in the film would help affirm young brown-skinned children by seeing someone who looks like them in a Disney film. The film being released in 2009, the same year that [[Barack Obama]] and [[Michelle Obama]] entered the White House was completely coincidental, according to the creators. But several commentators noted how the coincidence reinforced the positive portrayal of African-Americans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/dec/11/american-fairy-tale/|title= Disney Debuts African-American Princess Heroine}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121208302|title= NPR: Talking Race in Disney's Princess & The Frog}}</ref> 

Rose hosted a hometown screening of ''The Princess and the Frog'' for children from the Charter Oak Cultural Center, a non-profit multi-cultural arts center that provides free after-school programs in Hartford, Connecticut.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/12/06/anika_noni_rose_assumes_mantle_as_disneys_first_black_princess/ | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | first=Sarah | last=Rodman | title=Wearing the crown | date=December 6, 2009}}</ref>
Rose's performance in the film garnered one nomination for an [[NAACP Image Award]] and three nominations for the [[Black Reel Awards]]. She won the Black Reel Award for Best Outstanding Voice Performance.

Rose was named a [[Disney Legends|Disney Legend]] on August 19, 2011.<ref>[http://broadwayworld.com/article/Photo-Flash-Lea-Salonga-Anika-Noni-Rose-Paige-OHara-et-al-Honored-at-D23-Expo-20110820 "Photo Flash: Lea Salonga, Anika Noni Rose, Paige O'Hara et al. Honored at D23 Expo"] BroadwayWorld.com, August 20, 2011</ref> Rose said of the honor, "I always dreamed of being a voice in a Disney movie, but even in those dreams, I never once dreamed of being a princess... I feel like what an honor that this is and how the dream comes true, bigger and stronger than I had even imagined it."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://d23.com/walt-disney-legend/anika-noni-rose/|title=D23: Anika Noni Rose}}</ref>

====Upcoming ''Princess and the Frog'' ride====
In June 2020, Disney announced that they would be reworking their flume ride [[Splash Mountain]] with characters from ''The Princess and the Frog''. Anika Noni Rose said, "It's thrilling. People are amped and ready. I think it's awesome, particularly now, to be reinvigorating her story." Disney said the ride will take place immediately after the end of the film, and it will feature a [[Mardi Gras]] party. Rose also added that she would love for Disney to create a Tiana's Palace Restaurant at the theme parks. "I've been looking forward to a Tiana's Palace for years... I have dreams of them partnering with [[Café du Monde]] [a New Orleans based restaurant] on some real deal beignets, having some fantastic shrimp and grits and king cake during Mardi Gras season. And the occasional second line through the joint. Basically all the things I love!"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://people.com/travel/splash-mountain-princess-and-the-frog-anika-noni-rose-disney-world-disneyland/ |title=What to Expect From Disney's New Princess and the Frog Ride, According to Star Anika Noni Rose}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bet.com/celebrities/news/2020/06/26/princess-the-frog-disney-ride.html |title='The Princess And The Frog' Is Coming To Disney's Splash Mountain}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2551292/what-the-princess-and-the-frog-voice-actress-wants-to-see-in-splash-mountain-redesign-at-disneyland |title=What The Princess And The Frog Voice Actress Wants To See In Splash Mountain Redesign At Disneyland}}</ref>

I can give my voice to the ones who know it best, without anyone leaving home."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.broadway.com/buzz/198992/once-upon-a-time-tony-winner-anika-noni-rose-launches-bedtime-stories-for-the-littles/ |title=Once Upon a Time: Tony Winner Anika Noni Rose Launches Bedtime Stories for the Littles!}}</ref> She also said that she wanted to help children act silly, use their imaginations, and find a love of books that Rose said she had as a child. <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.fox10tv.com/video_magazines/people/anika-noni-rose-wants-to-help-children-find-their-love-of-books-like-she-had/video_88fdff94-eaf3-5f15-9449-8c106d984744.html |title=Anika Noni Rose Wants to Help Children Find Their Love of Books Like She Had as a Child}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://people.com/books/anika-noni-rose-on-why-she-decided-to-start-her-weekly-bedtime-stories-for-the-littles/ |title=Anika Noni Rose On Why She Decided to Start Her Weekly Bedtime Stories For the Littles!}}</ref>
