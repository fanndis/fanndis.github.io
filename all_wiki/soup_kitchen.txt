A '''soup kitchen''', '''meal center''', or '''food kitchen''' is a place where [[food]] is offered to the hungry usually for free or sometimes at a below-market [[price]]. Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods, soup kitchens are often staffed by [[Volunteering|volunteer]] organizations, such as [[Church body|church]] or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a [[food bank]] for free or at a low price, because they are considered a [[Charitable organization|charity]], which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services.

Many historical and typical modern soup kitchens serve only [[soup]] (hence its name), usually with some [[bread]]. But several establishments which refer to themselves as a "soup kitchen" also serve other types of food, so social scientists sometimes discuss them together with similar hunger relief agencies that provide more varied hot meals, like food kitchens and meal centers.

While societies have been using various methods to share food with the hungry for millennia, the first soup kitchens in the modern sense may have emerged in the late 18th century. By the late 19th century, they were located in several American and European cities. In the [[United States]] and elsewhere, they became more prominent in the 20th century, especially during the [[Great Depression]]. With the much improved economic conditions that immediately followed [[World War II]], soup kitchens became less widely used, at least in the advanced economies. In the United States, there was a resurgence in the use of soup kitchens following the cutbacks in welfare that were implemented in the early 1980s.

In the 21st century, the use of soup kitchens expanded in both the United States and Europe, following [[2007–08 world food price crisis|lasting global increases in the price of food]] which began in late 2006. Demand for their services grew as the [[Great Recession]] began to worsen economic conditions for those with lower incomes. In much of Europe, demand further increased after the introduction of [[austerity]]-based economic policies from 2010.

==History==
The earliest occurrences of soup kitchens are difficult to identify. Throughout history, societies have invariably recognized a [[moral obligation]] to feed the hungry. The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when one has resources to do so is the most obvious obligation of all. She also said that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], it was believed that people needed to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=[[The Need for Roots]]|page=6|year=2002 |orig-year=1942|isbn=0-415-27102-9|publisher=[[Routledge]]}}</ref> Soup has long been one of the most economical and simple ways to supply nutritious food to large numbers of people.<ref name ="allAboutSoup">

Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organisation in the 19th century, most human societies would generally either starve all together or not at all; because, communities would naturally share their food. As markets began to replace the older forms of resource allocation such as [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]], [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and [[autarky]], society's overall level of [[food security]] would typically rise. But food insecurity could become worse for the poorest section of society, and the need arose for more formal methods for providing them with food.<ref name ="GreatTransformation">{{Cite book|author=[[Karl Polanyi]]|title=[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]|year=2002 |orig-year=1942|chapter=chpt. 1-5|isbn=978-0-8070-5643-1|publisher=Beacon Press}}</ref> Christian churches traditionally provided food for the hungry since [[Late Antiquity]], with the nourishment mainly provided in the form of [[soup]].

===Emergence of the modern soup kitchen===
[[Image:Count Rumford.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Sir Benjamin Thompson, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], 1783]]The earliest modern soup kitchens were established by the inventor [[Benjamin Thompson|Sir Benjamin Thompson]], who was employed as an [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] in the 1790s. Thompson was an American loyalist refugee from New England and an inventor who was ennobled by Bavaria as Count Rumford. The Count was a prominent advocate of hunger relief, writing pamphlets that were widely read across Europe.<ref name="allAboutSoup2">{{cite book|author=Victoria R. Rumble|title=Soup Through the Ages|publisher=McFarland|year=2009|isbn=9780786439614|chapter=Chpt 29, ''Soup Kitchens''}}</ref>

His message was especially well received in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], where he had previously held a senior government position for several years and was known as "the Colonel". An urgent need had recently arisen in Britain for hunger relief, due to her leading role in driving the [[Industrial Revolution]]. While technological development and economic reforms were rapidly increasingly overall prosperity, conditions for the poorest were often made worse, as traditional ways of life were disrupted. In the closing years of the 18th century, soup kitchens run on the principles pioneered by Rumford were to be found throughout [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Scotland]], with about 60,000 people being fed by them daily in [[London]] alone.<ref name="allAboutSoup2" />

While soup kitchens were initially well regarded, they attracted criticism from some, for encouraging dependency, and sometimes on a local level for attracting vagrants to an area. In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], they were made illegal, along with other forms of aid apart from workhouses, by the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]].{{efn|Note that criticism of soup kitchens was only a minor driver of the 1834 law - the move was driven more by free market ideology and discontent with other forms of "outdoor" aid like the much more widely disliked Speemhanland system, see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom]].}}

During the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] of the 19th century, in which as many as one million people may have died, the [[British government]] passed the [[Temporary Relief Act]] (also known as the Soup Kitchen Act) in February 1847. The Act amended the restrictions on the provision of aid outside the workhouses for the duration of the famine and expressly allowed the establishment of soup kitchens in Ireland to relieve pressure from the overstretched [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]] system, which was proving to be totally inadequate in coping with the disaster.<ref name="Poverty2">{{cite book|author=Gwendolyn Mink and Alice O'Connor|title=Poverty in the United States|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-597-4|pages=321–323}}</ref>

Prohibition against soup kitchens was soon relaxed on mainland Britain too, though they never again became as prevalent as they had been in the early 19th century, partly as from the 1850s onwards, economic conditions generally began to improve even for the poorest. For the first few decades after the return of soup kitchens to mainland [[Great Britain|Britain]], they were at first heavily regulated, run by groups like the [[Charity Organization Society]]. Even in the early 20th century, campaigning journalists like [[Bart Kennedy]] would criticize them for their long queues, and for the degrading questions staff would ask the hungry before giving out any soup.<ref name="allAboutSoup2" />

===Spread to the United States===

The concept of soup kitchens spread to the [[United States]] from Ireland after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great famine]] and the concomitant wave of Irish emigration to the [[New World]].<ref name="Poverty">{{cite book|author=Gwendolyn Mink and Alice O'Connor|title=Poverty in the United States|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-597-4|pages=321–323}}</ref> The earliest ones were established in the 1870s. A sharp rise in the number of hungry people resulting from an industrial recession coincided with the success of the  [[Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor|AICP]], and the American branch of the ''Charity Organization Society'', in getting various forms of "outdoor relief"{{efn|In the main, this meant ending the practice where municipal officials would give out small sums of cash to the poor. Unlike in Britain a few decades earlier, the US did not pass nationwide laws restricting private individuals from giving food to the hungry.}} banned. This resulted in civil society establishing soup kitchens, to help feed those of the poor who did not wish to subject themselves to the regimented organisation of the [[Almshouses]] favored by the charitable societies.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Todd DePastino]]|title=Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America|page=[https://archive.org/details/citizenhobohowce00depa/page/22 22]|year=2005|isbn=0226143791|publisher=[[Chicago University Press]]|url=https://archive.org/details/citizenhobohowce00depa/page/22}}</ref>

It is believed the term “breadline” entered the popular lexicon in the 1880s. It was during those years that a noteworthy bakery in New York City’s Greenwich Village, “Fleischmann Model Viennese Bakery,” instituted a policy of distributing unsold baked goods to the poor at the end of their business day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wetsteon |first=Ross |title=Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village, the American Bohemia, 1910–1960 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2003 |at=preface |isbn=0-684-86996-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/republicofdreams00wetz }}</ref>

The concept of soup kitchens hit the mainstream of [[United States]] consciousness during the [[Great Depression]]. One soup kitchen in [[Chicago]] was even sponsored by [[United States|American]] mobster [[Al Capone]] in an effort to clean up his image.<ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/history/acoffee.html "Soup Kitchens"] ''Social Security Online History Page''.</ref>

With the improved economic conditions that followed the Second World War, there was less need for soup kitchens in advanced economies.<ref name = "sweet">{{cite book|author=Janet Poppendieck|title=Sweet Charity?: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement|chapter=Introduction, Chpt 1|year=1999|isbn=0140245561|publisher=Penguin}}</ref>  However, with the scaling back of welfare provision in the 1980s under [[Ronald Reagan|president Reagan]]'s administration, there was a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies such as soup kitchens. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks, about 80% of emergency kitchens, and all known food rescue organisations, were established in the US after 1981.<ref name= "sweet"/><ref name="walter"/> Presently, [[Catholic Charities USA]] of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], founded by [[Sisters of Loretto|The Sisters of Loretto]], provides food to upwards of 600-700 persons or more per day, and has been doing so since 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccharitiescc.org/what-we-do/marian-house/soup-kitchen/|title=Marian House Soup Kitchen|website=ccharitiescc.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>

==In the 21st century==
Use of soup kitchens has grown rapidly across the world, following the lasting global inflation in the cost of food that began in late 2006. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] further increased the demand for soup kitchens, as did the introduction of austerity policies that have become common in Europe since 2010. Modern soup kitchens are generally well regarded, though like their historical counterparts they are sometimes disliked by local residents for lowering the tone of a neighborhood.<ref name="walter">{{cite book|editor= William A Dando|author= Andrew Walter| title=Food and Famine in the 21st Century| pages=171–181|year=2012| isbn=978-1-59884-730-7| publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]

The institution of the [[Sikh]] langar, a community run free kitchen, was started by the first Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]]. It was designed to uphold the principle of equality between all people regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender, or social status. In addition to the ideals of equality, the tradition of langar expresses the ethics of sharing, community, inclusiveness, and oneness of humankind. Every Sikh [[Gurdwara|shrine]] has a [[Selfless service|religiously sanctioned moral and humanitarian obligation to serve]] and [[Langar (Sikhism)|provide hospitality, provisions, nourishments and meals]] to any man, regardless of race, creed, religious profession, identification, or affiliation.

=== Comparison with front line food banks and pantries===
[[File:US Navy 090806-N-6220J-004 Sailors and Navy Delayed Entry Program members serve breakfast to homeless men and women at Dorothy's Soup Kitchen in Salinas, Calif. during Salinas Navy Week community service event.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[United States Navy]] serve the homeless at Dorothy's Soup Kitchen, [[Salinas, California]] in 2009]]
In some countries such as [[UK|Great Britain]], increased demand from hungry people has largely been met by [[food bank]]s, operating on the "front line" model, where they give food out directly to the hungry. In the USA, such establishments are called "food pantries"; Americans generally reserve the term "food bank" for entities which perform a warehouse-like function, distributing food to front line agencies, but not directly to the hungry themselves. Instead of providing hot meals, front line food banks and pantries hand out packages of groceries so that recipients can cook themselves several meals at home. This is often more convenient for the end user. They can receive food for up to a dozen or so meals at once, whereas with a soup kitchen, they typically only receive a single meal with each visit.{{efn|Although some soup kitchens also like to give visitors a second "carry out" meal.}}

Food banks typically have procedures needed to prevent unscrupulous people taking advantage of them, unlike soup kitchens which will usually give a meal to whoever turns up with no questions asked. The soup kitchen's greater accessibility can make it more suitable for assisting people with long-term dependence on food aid. Soup kitchens can also provide warmth, companionship, and the shared communal experience of dining with others, which can be especially valued by people such as disabled, pensioners, widowers, homeless and ex-homeless. In some countries such as Greece, soup kitchens have become the most widely used form of food aid, with ''[[The Guardian]]'' reporting in 2012, that an estimated 400,000 Greeks visit a soup kitchen each day.<ref name = "Poverty"/><ref name = "walter"/><ref>{{cite news
