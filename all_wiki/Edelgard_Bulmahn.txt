==Political career==
Bulmahn joined the SPD in 1969 and was a member of the party executive committee from 1993 to 2011.

===Member of the German Bundestag, 1987-2017===
Bulmahn entered the German Bundestag following the [[1987 West German federal election|1987 federal elections]], representing the 42nd electoral district of [[Hannover]].

From 2005 to 2009, Bulmahn served as chairwoman of the Bundestag Committee for Economic Affairs and Technology. During that time, she was also the deputy chairwoman of the Parliamentary Friendship Group for Relations with Arabic-Speaking States in the Middle East, which is in charge of maintaining inter-parliamentary relations with [[Bahrain]], [[Irak]], [[Yemen]], [[Jordan]], [[Qatar]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and the [[Palestinian territories]].

===Federal Minister of Education and Research, 1998-2005===
Bulmahn’s tenure fell in a period of significant changes in Germany’s education system. In 2002, amid a heated debate surrounding the German parliament’s vote on allowing [[Embryonic stem cell|human embryo stem cells]] to be imported for medical research, she voiced her support for allowing the import of embryo stem cells under strict conditions.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1791365.stm Germany authorises stem cell imports] ''[[BBC News]]'', January 30, 2002.</ref> When Bulmahn first proposed in 2004 an initiative to foster an elite circle of universities with significant funds from the federal government, she drew heavy criticism; however, after lengthy negotiations with the state governments, a compromise was finally reached in June 2005.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v4/n11/full/nmat1521.html A new focus on excellence] ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Nature Materials 4, 795 (2005).</ref><ref>[http://www.dw.de/paving-the-way-for-academic-excellence/a-1627422 Paving the Way for Academic Excellence] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', June 24, 2005.</ref>

===Vice-President of the Bundestag, 2013-2017===

She also served as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs as well as of the Sub-Committee for Civilian Crisis Prevention.

In October 2016, Bulmahn announced that she would not stand in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal elections]] but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.<ref>Andreas Schinkel (October 6, 2016), [http://www.haz.de/Hannover/Aus-der-Stadt/Uebersicht/SPD-Abgeordnete-Edelgard-Bulmahn-aus-Hannover-will-nicht-mehr-in-den-Bundestag Bulmahn will nicht mehr in den Bundestag] ''[[Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.</ref>
