The company was founded by [[James Liang]], Neil Shen, Min Fan, and Qi Ji in June 1999.<ref name="Forbes">{{cite news | first=Russell | last=Flannery | url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/29/ctrip-china-lodging-markets-equities-ipo.html |title=Ctrip's Remarkable Journey: China travel boom fuels hotel chain IPO | work=[[Forbes]] | date=March 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Marketwatch">{{cite news | first=Luisa | last=Beltran | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ctripcom-soars-in-first-day-of-trade | title=Ctrip.com IPO soars in first day | work=[[MarketWatch]] | date=December 9, 2003}}</ref>

The company was listed on the [[NASDAQ]] in 2003 through a [[variable interest entity]] (VIE) based in the [[Cayman Islands]] in a [[Merrill Lynch]]-led offering, raising US$75 million from the sale of 4.2 million [[American depositary receipt]]s at $18 each. It appreciated 86% to close at $33.94 per ADR in its first day of trading. The stock traded at a peak of $37.35 on its first day of trading, making it the first company since the November 2000 IPO of [[Transmeta]] to double its price in the first day of trading.<ref name="Marketwatch"/>

In 2006, about 70% of the company's sales came from just four cities in China: [[Beijing]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Shenzhen]].<ref name="Bloomberg">{{cite news | last1=Liu | first1=John | first2=Damien | last2=Ryan | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aYibGavqCTL8&refer=asia | title=Ctrip May Buy Asian Companies as More Chinese Travel | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=May 29, 2006}}</ref>

In June 2020, Trip.com joined China Eastern to launch new airline in Hainan as plans to make the island a free trade hub promise greater air traffic.<ref>[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3089013/china-eastern-launch-new-airline-hainan-partners-including “China Eastern to launch new airline in Hainan with partners including Trip.com unit, as plans to make the island a free trade hub promise greater air traffic”]</ref>

==Telecommuting study==
The company is a proponent of [[scientific management]].<ref name="HBS">{{cite web | first=David | last=Garvin |url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41337|title=Ctrip: Scientifically Managing Travel Services | publisher=[[Harvard Business School]] | date=January 1, 2012}}.</ref>  One example of this is the [[randomized control trial]] Ctrip ran on [[telecommuting]], which has strong impact on company profits. Before making management decisions, Ctrip conducted an experiment on 242 employees, sponsored by professors at [[Stanford University]] and [[Peking University]]. The experiment found that employees randomly assigned to work at home for 9 months increased their output by 13.5% versus the office-based control group, and their turnover rates fell by almost 50%.  Ctrip subsequently implemented telecommuting across the company.<ref>Bloom, Nicholas, Liang, James, Roberts, John and Ying, Jenny [https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/wfh.pdf "Does working from home work?
