She graduated in Law from [[Sofia University]] in 1981, and in 1984 she became a Doctor of Law.{{citation needed|date=July 2018 |reason=date uncertain}} She worked as a journalist for the Law Programme of the [[Bulgarian National Radio]] while being an Assistant Professor at [[Sofia University]]. In 1990 she took a job as Senior Legal Advisor at the [[Council of Ministers of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] and held it until 2001. In the meantime Kuneva specialized in [[Foreign Affairs]] and [[Environmental Law]] at [[Georgetown University]] and the [[University of Oxford]].{{sfn|Lilov|2013|p=65}}

In June 2001 she was elected a ''deputy'' (Member of Bulgarian Parliament) as a founding member of the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] [[Simeon II National Movement]] (NDSV) party. In August 2001 Kuneva left her position in the Bulgarian parliament because she was appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chief Negotiator of the [[Republic of Bulgaria]] with the European Union. She represented the Bulgarian Government in the Convention on the Future of Europe (the [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Convention]]), which designed the [[EU Constitutional Treaty]] (the European Constitution).

In May 2002 she was appointed Bulgaria's first [[Ministry of European Intergation (Bulgaria)|Minister of European Affairs]] in the [[Sakskoburggotski Government|government]] of former [[List of Bulgarian rulers|Tsar]] [[Simeon Sakskoburggotski]]. She held that job even after the 2005 parliamentary elections, when NDSV became a junior partner in the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]-dominated [[coalition government]] of [[Sergey Stanishev]] – the only minister of the former cabinet to retain her post.

On 26 October 2006 Kuneva was nominated to be [[List of EU Commissioners by Nationality#Bulgarian Commissioners|Bulgaria's first member of the]] [[European Commission]]. European Commission President [[Jose Manuel Durao Barroso]] assigned her the [[Portfolio (government)|portfolio]] of [[Commissioner for Consumer Protection|Consumer Protection]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1485|title=President Barroso presents the Commissioner designate for Bulgaria|website=europa.eu}}</ref> Kuneva was decisively approved by the [[European Parliament]] on 12 December 2006 with 583 votes "in favour", 21 votes "against" and 28 votes "abstentions". She commenced her [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] as [[EU Commissioner]] on 1 January 2007, when Bulgaria officially joined the EU. On 22 January 2007 Meglena Kuneva took an Oath as a European Commissioner at the [[European Court of Justice|European Court]] in [[Luxembourg]]. One of her first acts as a European Commissioner was to criticize the [[iPod]] and its effects on the youth in Bulgaria.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

During her term in office, Kuneva was interested in online data collection (of personal data), [[profiling (information science)|profiling]] and [[behavioral targeting]], and in particular is looking for "enforcing existing regulation on the Internet and to regulate where adequate response to consumer concerns on the issue of data collection".<ref>[http://www.edri.org/edri-gram/number7.7/behavoural-target-eu-consumers Behavioural targeting at the European Consumer Summit], 8 April 2009</ref>
