'''Thanksgiving''' is a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday in the United States]], celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/11/21/165655925/how-did-thanksgiving-end-up-on-thursday|title=How Did Thanksgiving End Up On The Fourth Thursday?|website=NPR.org}}</ref> It is sometimes called '''American Thanksgiving''' (outside the United States) to distinguish it from [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|the Canadian holiday of the same name]]. It originated as a [[harvest festival]], and the centerpiece of Thanksgiving celebrations remains [[Thanksgiving dinner]]. The dinner traditionally consists of foods and dishes indigenous to [[the Americas]], namely [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[potatoes]] (usually [[Mashed potato|mashed]]), [[stuffing]], [[Winter squash|squash]], [[maize|corn]] (maize), [[green beans]], [[Cranberry|cranberries]] (typically in [[Cranberry sauce|sauce form]]), and [[pumpkin pie]]. Other Thanksgiving customs include charitable organizations offering Thanksgiving dinner for the poor, attending [[church service|religious services]], watching parades, and viewing [[American football|football games]].<ref name="Counihan2013"/> In American culture Thanksgiving is regarded as the beginning of the fall–winter [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]], which includes [[Christmas]] and the [[New Year]].

===Early thanksgiving observances===

[[File: Berkeley Plantation, Shrine marking 1st Thanksgiving in America.jpg|thumb|right|Shrine of the first U.S. Thanksgiving in 1619 at Berkeley Hundred in Charles City County, Virginia]]

Setting aside time to give thanks for one's blessings, along with holding feasts to celebrate a harvest, are both practices that long predate the European settlement of North America. The first documented thanksgiving services in territory currently belonging to the United States were conducted by Spaniards<ref name="forteachers"/><ref name=LOCTimeline/> and the French in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite news|last=Davis |first=Kenneth C. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/opinion/26davis.html?th&emc=th |title=A French Connection |work=The New York Times |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref>

Thanksgiving services were routine in what became the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] as early as 1607,<ref name=Ann2>Morill, Ann "Thanksgiving and Other Harvest Festivals" Infobase Publishing, {{ISBN|1-60413-096-2}} p.33</ref> with the first permanent settlement of [[Jamestown, Virginia]] holding a thanksgiving in 1610.<ref name="forteachers"/> In 1619, 38 English settlers arrived at [[Berkeley Hundred]] in Charles City County, Virginia.

===Harvest festival observed by the Pilgrims at Plymouth===

The most prominent historic thanksgiving event in American popular culture is the 1621 celebration at the [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth Plantation]], where the settlers held a harvest feast after a successful growing season. Autumn or early winter feasts continued sporadically in later years, first as an impromptu religious observance and later as a civil tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

The Plymouth settlers, known as [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]], had settled in land abandoned when all but one of the [[Patuxet tribe|Patuxet Indians]] died in a disease outbreak. After a harsh winter killed half of the Plymouth settlers, the last surviving Patuxet, [[Squanto|Tisquantum]], more commonly known by the diminutive variant Squanto (who had learned English and avoided the plague as a slave in Europe), came in at the request of [[Samoset]], the first Native American to encounter the Pilgrims. Squanto taught the Pilgrims how to catch eel and grow corn and served as an interpreter for them until he too succumbed to the disease a year later. The [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] leader [[Massasoit]] also gave food to the colonists during the first winter when supplies brought from England were insufficient.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

The Pilgrims celebrated at Plymouth for three days after their first harvest in 1621. The exact time is unknown, but James Baker, the [[Plimoth Plantation]] vice president of research, stated in 1996, "The event occurred between Sept. 21 and Nov. 11, 1621, with the most likely time being around [[Michaelmas]] (Sept. 29), the traditional time."<ref name=Julian>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-11-20-9611200300-story.html|title=HISTORY IS SERVED|first=Sheryl Julian, The Boston|last=Globe|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> Seventeenth-century accounts do not identify this as a Thanksgiving observance, rather it followed the harvest. It included 50 people who were on the Mayflower (all who remained of the 100 who had landed) and 90 Native Americans.<ref name=Julian/> The feast was cooked by the four adult Pilgrim women who survived their first winter in the New World (Eleanor Billington, Elizabeth Hopkins, [[Mary Brewster]], and [[Susanna White (Mayflower passenger)|Susanna White]]), along with young daughters and male and female servants.<ref name=Julian/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mayflowerhistory.com/women/|last=Johnson|first= Caleb|title=Women of Early Plymouth|publisher= MayflowerHistory.com|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref>

Two colonists gave personal accounts of the 1621 feast in Plymouth. The Pilgrims, most of whom were Separatists ([[English Dissenters]]), are not to be confused with [[Puritans]], who established their own [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] on the [[Shawmut Peninsula]] (current day [[Boston]]) in 1630.<ref name="history">{{cite web|last=Banner|first=David|title=Boston History—The History of Boston, Massachusetts|url=http://www.searchboston.com/articles/history.html|publisher=SearchBoston|accessdate=April 20, 2009|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315031352/http://www.searchboston.com/articles/history.html|archive-date=March 15, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=Lawrence W.|title=Planning the city upon a hill: Boston since 1630|pages=11–12|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-87023-923-6}}</ref> Both groups were strict [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], but differed in their views regarding the [[Church of England]].

All the summer there was no want; and now began to come in store of fowl, as winter approached, of which this place did abound when they can be used (but afterward decreased by degrees). And besides waterfowl, there was great store of wild turkeys, of which they took many, besides venison, etc. Besides, they had about a peck a meal a week to a person, or now since harvest, Indian corn to the proportion.

[[Edward Winslow]], in ''[[Mourt's Relation]]'' wrote:
{{quote|Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so we might after a special manner rejoice together after we had gathered the fruits of our labor. They four in one day killed as much fowl as, with a little help beside, served the company almost a week. At which time, amongst other recreations, we exercised our arms, many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among the rest their greatest king Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three days we entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five deer, which we brought to the plantation and bestowed on our governor, and upon the captain and others.

William DeLoss Love calculates that this thanksgiving was made on Wednesday, July 30, 1623, a day before the arrival of a supply ship with more colonists,<ref name="Love"/> but before the fall harvest. In Love's opinion this 1623 thanksgiving was significant because the order to recognize the event was from civil authority<ref>{{cite web|last=Winslow|first=Edward|title=Good Newes from New-England: or, A true relation of things very remarkable at the plantation of Plimoth in New-England—Together with a relation of such religious and civil laws and customers, as are in practice amongst the Indians|url=http://mayflowerhistory.com/s/Good-News-from-New-England.pdf|year=1624|work=MayflowerHistory.com|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}, original at [https://archive.org/stream/goodnewesfromnew00wins#page/n11/mode/2up]</ref> (Governor Bradford), and not from the church, making it likely the first civil recognition of Thanksgiving in [[New England]].<ref name="Love"/>

Referring to the 1623 harvest after the nearly catastrophic drought, Bradford wrote:
{{quote|And afterward the Lord sent them such seasonable showers, with the interchange of fair warm weather as, through His blessing, caused a fruitful and liberal harvest, to their no small comfort and rejoicing. For which mercy, in time convenient, they also set apart a day of thanksgiving{{nbsp}}... By this time harvest was come, and instead of famine now God gave them plenty{{nbsp}}... for which they blessed God. And the effect of their particular planting was well seen, for all had{{nbsp}}... pretty well{{nbsp}}... so as any general want or famine had not been amongst them since to this day.{{Sfn|Bradford|1952|p=132}}}}

These firsthand accounts do not appear to have contributed to the early development of the holiday. Bradford's "Of Plymouth Plantation" was not published until the 1850s. The booklet "Mourt's Relation" was summarized by other publications without the now-familiar thanksgiving story. By the eighteenth century, the original booklet appeared to be lost or forgotten; a copy was rediscovered in Philadelphia in 1820, with the first full reprinting in 1841. In a footnote the editor, Alexander Young, was the first person to identify the 1621 feast as the first Thanksgiving.<ref name="Baker"/>

Kennedy issued Proclamation 3560 on November 5, 1963: "Over three centuries ago, our forefathers in Virginia and in Massachusetts, far from home in a lonely wilderness, set aside a time of thanksgiving.

===The Revolutionary War===

The First National Proclamation of Thanksgiving was given by the [[Continental Congress]] in 1777 from its temporary location in [[York, Pennsylvania]], while the British occupied the national capital at Philadelphia. Delegate [[Samuel Adams]] created the first draft. Congress then adopted the final version:
{{quote|For as much as it is the indispensable Duty of all Men to adore the superintending Providence of Almighty God; to acknowledge with Gratitude their Obligation to him for Benefits received, and to implore such farther Blessings as they stand in Need of: And it had pleased him in his abundant Mercy, not only to continue to us the innumerable Bounties of his common Providence; but also to smile upon us in the Prosecution of a just and necessary war, for the Defense and Establishment of our unalienable Rights and Liberties; particularly in that he hath been pleased, in so great a Measure, to prosper the Means used for the Support of our Troops, and to crown our Arms with most signal success:

It is therefore recommended to the legislative or executive Powers of these United States to set apart Thursday, the eighteenth Day of December next, for Solemn Thanksgiving and Praise: That at one Time and with one Voice, the good People may express the grateful Feelings of their Hearts, and consecrate themselves to the Service of their Divine Benefactor; and that, together with their sincere Acknowledgments and Offerings, they may join the penitent Confession of their manifold Sins, whereby they had forfeited every Favor; and their humble and earnest Supplication that it may please God through the Merits of Jesus Christ, mercifully to forgive and blot them out of Remembrance; That it may please him graciously to afford his Blessing on the Governments of these States respectively, and prosper the public Council of the whole: To inspire our Commanders, both by Land and Sea, and all under them, with that Wisdom and Fortitude which may render them fit Instruments, under the Providence of Almighty God, to secure for these United States, the greatest of all human Blessings, Independence and Peace: That it may please him, to prosper the Trade and Manufactures of the People, and the Labor of the Husbandman, that our Land may yield its Increase: To take Schools and Seminaries of Education, so necessary for cultivating the Principles of true Liberty, Virtue and Piety, under his nurturing Hand; and to prosper the Means of Religion, for the promotion and enlargement of that Kingdom, which consisteth "in Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost.

And it is further recommended, That servile Labor, and such Recreation, as, though at other Times innocent, may be unbecoming the Purpose of this Appointment, be omitted on so solemn an Occasion.}}

[[George Washington]], leader of the revolutionary forces in the American Revolutionary War, proclaimed a Thanksgiving in December 1777 as a victory celebration honoring the defeat of the British at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/thanksgiving/|title=Thanksgiving|website=George Washington's Mount Vernon|access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>

<blockquote>
By the United States in Congress assembled,
PROCLAMATION.

It being the indispensable duty of all nations, not only to offer up their supplications to Almighty God, the giver of all good, for His gracious assistance in a time of distress, but also in a solemn and public manner, to give Him praise for His goodness in general, and especially for great and signal interpositions of His Providence in their behalf; therefore, the United States in Congress assembled, taking into their consideration the many instances of Divine goodness to these States in the course of the important conflict, in which they have been so long engaged; the present happy and promising state of public affairs, and the events of the war in the course of the year now drawing to a close; particularly the harmony of the public Councils which is so necessary to the success of the public cause; the perfect union and good understanding which has hitherto subsisted between them and their allies, notwithstanding the artful and unwearied attempts of the common enemy to divide them; the success of the arms of the United States and those of their allies; and the acknowledgment of their Independence by another European power, whose friendship and commerce must be of great and lasting advantage to these States; Do hereby recommend it to the inhabitants of these States in general, to observe and request the several states to interpose their authority, in appointing and commanding the observation of THURSDAY the TWENTY-EIGHTH DAY OF NOVEMBER next as a day of SOLEMN THANKSGIVING to GOD for all His mercies; and they do further recommend to all ranks to testify their gratitude to God for His goodness by a cheerful obedience to His laws and by promoting, each in his station, and by his influence, the practice of true and undefiled religion, which is the great foundation of public prosperity and national happiness.

Done in Congress at Philadelphia, the eleventh day of October, in the year of our LORD, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two, and of our Sovereignty and Independence, the seventh.

On Thursday, September 24, 1789, the first House of Representatives voted to recommend the First Amendment of the newly drafted Constitution to the states for ratification. The next day, Congressman Elias Boudinot from New Jersey proposed that the House and Senate jointly request of President Washington to proclaim a day of thanksgiving for "the many signal favors of Almighty God". Boudinot said he "could not think of letting the session pass over without offering an opportunity to all the citizens of the United States of joining, with one voice, in returning to Almighty God their sincere thanks for the many blessings he had poured down upon them."<ref>{{citation |title=The Annals of the Congress, The Debates and Proceedings in the Congress of the United States |author=compiled from authentic materials by Joseph Gales, Senior |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Gales and Seaton |year=1834 |volume=1 |pages=949–950}}</ref>

As President, on October 3, 1789, George Washington made the following proclamation and created the first Thanksgiving Day designated by the national government of the United States of America:
{{quote|Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor, and whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me "to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness."

Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be. That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks, for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country previous to their becoming a Nation, for the signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable interpositions of his providence, which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late war, for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty, which we have since enjoyed, for the peaceable and rational manner, in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national One now lately instituted, for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed; and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and in general for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us.

And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions, to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually, to render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed, to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shown kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord. To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and Us, and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.

On January 1, 1795, Washington proclaimed a Thanksgiving Day to be observed on Thursday, February 19.

President [[John Adams]] declared Thanksgivings in 1798 and 1799. As [[Thomas Jefferson]] was a [[deism|deist]] and a [[Religious views of Thomas Jefferson|skeptic of the idea of divine intervention]], he did not declare any thanksgiving days during his presidency. [[James Madison]] renewed the tradition in 1814, in response to resolutions of Congress, at the close of the War of 1812. Caleb Strong, Governor of the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]], declared the holiday in 1813, "for a day of public thanksgiving and prayer" for Thursday, November 25 of that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/1812/70475/data|title=The Weekly Messenger Newspaper—October 15, 1813|last=Strong|first=Caleb|date=October 15, 1813|website=1812 History|access-date=October 6, 2017}}</ref>

Madison also declared the holiday twice in 1815; however, neither of these was celebrated in autumn. In 1816, Governor Plumer of New Hampshire appointed Thursday, November 14 to be observed as a day of Public Thanksgiving and Governor Brooks of Massachusetts appointed Thursday, November 28 to be "observed throughout that State as a day of Thanksgiving".<ref name="test">[Zanesville Express, October 31, 1816.]</ref>

A thanksgiving day was annually appointed by the governor of New York, [[DeWitt Clinton|De Witt Clinton]], in 1817. In 1830, the [[New York State Legislature]] officially sanctioned thanksgiving as a holiday, making New York the first state outside of New England to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|title=N.Y.’s place in Thanksgiving lore: How Gotham is as central to our modern conception of the holiday as New England|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/andrew-smith-n-y-s-place-thanksgiving-lore-article-1.2445931|access-date=2020-11-26|website=nydailynews.com}}</ref> By 1858 proclamations appointing a day of thanksgiving were issued by the governors of 25 states and two territories.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the middle of the [[American Civil War]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]], prompted by a series of editorials written by [[Sarah Josepha Hale]],<ref name="NetINS Showcase-AB">{{cite web|url = http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/thanks.htm| title = Proclamation of Thanksgiving (October 3, 1863)|publisher =Abraham Lincoln Online|accessdate =November 24, 2010}}</ref> proclaimed a national Thanksgiving Day, to be celebrated on the 26th, the final Thursday of November 1863. The document, written by Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]], reads as follows:

{{quote|The year that is drawing towards its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, the order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship; the ax had enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. The population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years, with large increase of freedom.

No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Highest God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.

It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and voice by the whole American people. I do therefore invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to his tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility and Union.

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington, this third day of October, in the [[Anno Domini|year of our Lord]] [[1863|one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three]], and of the independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.

Since 1863, Thanksgiving has been observed annually in the United States. The holiday superseded [[Evacuation Day (New York)|Evacuation Day]], a ''de facto'' national holiday that had been held on November 25 each year prior to the Civil War and commemorated the British withdrawal from the United States after the American Revolution.<ref name="rodwan">{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2010-11-no-thanks|first=John G.|last=Rodwan, Jr.|title=No Thanks|work=Humanist Network News|date=November 20, 2010|accessdate=September 11, 2011|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807050729/http://www.americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2010-11-no-thanks|archive-date=August 7, 2011}}</ref>

===Post-Civil War era===

[[File:Thanksgiving 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Servicemen eating a Thanksgiving dinner after the end of [[World War I|World War{{nbsp}}I]] (1918)]]

On June 28, 1870, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed into law the ''Holidays Act'' that made Thanksgiving a yearly "appointed or remembered" federal holiday in Washington D.C. Three other holidays included in the law were [[New Years]], [[Christmas]], and July 4. The law did not extend outside of Washington D.C., while the date assigned for Thanksgiving was left to the discretion of the President.{{sfn|Statutes at Large 1871}}{{sfn|Stathis|1999|pages=6–7}}{{sfn|Belz|2017}} In January 1879, [[George Washington]]'s Birthday, February 22, was added by Congress to the federal holidays list.{{sfn|Straus|2014|pp=1–2}} On January 6, 1885, a Congressional act expanded the ''Holidays Act'' to apply to all federal departments and employees throughout the nation. Federal workers received pay for all the holidays, including Thanksgiving.{{sfn|Straus|2014|pp=1–2}}

During the second half of the 19th century, Thanksgiving traditions in America varied from region to region. A traditional New England Thanksgiving, for example, consisted of a raffle held on Thanksgiving Eve (in which the prizes were mainly geese or turkeys), a shooting match on Thanksgiving morning (in which turkeys and chickens were used as targets), church services—and then the traditional feast, which consisted of some familiar Thanksgiving staples such as turkey and pumpkin pie, and some not-so-familiar dishes such as [[pigeon pie]]. The earliest [[high school football]] rivalries took root in the late 19th century in Massachusetts, stemming from games played on Thanksgiving; professional football took root as a Thanksgiving staple during the sport's genesis in the 1890s, and the tradition of Thanksgiving football both at the high school and professional level continues to this day. The [[Southern United States]] had long resisted adopting the holiday before largely accepting it with the increased influence of football on the day.<ref name=mckenziesbook>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/11/22/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-thanksgiving/|title=The surprising story of the First Thanksgiving|author1=Katrina Trinko|author2=Daniel Davis|work=The Daily Signal|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|date=November 22, 2018|access-date=December 3, 2018}}</ref>

In New York City, people would dress up in fanciful masks and costumes and roam the streets in merry-making mobs. By the beginning of the 20th century, these mobs had morphed{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} into [[Ragamuffin parade]]s consisting mostly of children dressed as "ragamuffins" in costumes of old and mismatched adult clothes and with deliberately smudged faces, but by the late 1950s the tradition had diminished enough to only exist in its original form in a few communities around New York, with many of its traditions subsumed into the [[Halloween]] custom of [[trick-or-treating]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Nigro|first=Carmen|title=Thanksgiving Ragamuffin Parade|url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/11/23/thanksgiving-ragamuffin-parade|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}</ref>

===1939 to 1941===

Abraham Lincoln's successors as president followed his example of annually declaring the final Thursday in November to be Thanksgiving. But in 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] broke with this tradition.<ref name=TwoThanksgivings/> November had five Thursdays that year (instead of the more-common four), Roosevelt declared the fourth Thursday as Thanksgiving rather than the fifth one. Although many popular histories state otherwise, he made clear that his plan was to establish the holiday on the next-to-last Thursday in the month instead of the last one. With the country still in the midst of [[The Great Depression]], Roosevelt thought an earlier Thanksgiving would give merchants a longer period to sell goods before Christmas. Increasing profits and spending during this period, Roosevelt hoped, would help bring the country out of the Depression. At the time, advertising goods for Christmas before Thanksgiving was considered [[Christmas creep|inappropriate]]. [[Fred Lazarus, Jr.]], founder of the [[Federated Department Stores]] (later [[Macy's]]), is credited with convincing Roosevelt to push Thanksgiving to a week earlier to expand the shopping season, and within two years the change passed through Congress into law.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Role of Fred Lazarus Jr. in Giving Us Department Stores Like Macy's and Bloomingdale's|url=http://www.atouchofbusiness.com/business-topics/success-stories/fred-lazarus-jr-0080.html|work=ATouchofBusiness.com|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macysinc.com/about-us/macysinc-history/overview/default.aspx |title=Macy's, Inc.

Republicans decried the change, calling it an affront to the memory of Lincoln. People began referring to November 30 as the "Republican Thanksgiving" and November 23 as the "Democratic Thanksgiving" or "[[Franksgiving]]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Melanie|title=Happy Franksgiving |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704888404574548082613991744|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=November 26, 2010|date=November 24, 2009}}
</ref>
Regardless of the politics, many localities had made a tradition of celebrating on the last Thursday, and many football teams had a tradition of playing their final games of the season on Thanksgiving; with their schedules set well in advance, they could not change. Since a presidential declaration of Thanksgiving Day was not legally binding, Roosevelt's change was widely disregarded. Twenty-three states went along with Roosevelt's recommendation, 22 did not, and some, like [[Texas]], could not decide and took both days as government holidays.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 1940 and 1941, years in which November had four Thursdays, Roosevelt declared the third one as Thanksgiving. As in 1939, some states went along with the change while others retained the traditional last-Thursday date.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===1942 to present===

On October 6, 1941, both houses of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed a joint resolution fixing the traditional last-Thursday date for the holiday beginning in 1942. However, in December of that year the [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed an amendment to the resolution that split the difference by requiring that Thanksgiving be observed annually on the fourth Thursday of November, which was usually the last Thursday and sometimes (two years out of seven, on average) the penultimate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congress Establishes Thanksgiving |url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/thanksgiving/|work=The National Archives|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate=November 25, 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Stathis|1999|pp=6–7}} The amendment also passed the House, and on December 26, 1941, President Roosevelt signed this bill, for the first time making the date of Thanksgiving a matter of federal law and fixing the day as the fourth Thursday of November.<ref name=5USC87b>{{cite web|title=5 U.S.C. 87b.

For several years some states continued to observe the last-Thursday date in years with five November Thursdays (the next such year being 1944), with [[Texas]] doing so as late as 1956.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Thanksgiving was founded as a religious observance for all the members of the community to give thanks to God for a common purpose.

The float that traditionally ends the Macy's Parade is the [[Santa Claus]] float, the arrival of which is an unofficial sign of the beginning of the Christmas season. It is billed as the world's largest parade.<ref name=NYCThanksgivingParade>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/11/24/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-2016/|title=Millions of Revelers Marvel Over Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|publisher=CBS Broadcasting Inc|date=November 24, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>

The oldest Thanksgiving Day parade is the [[6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade|Philadelphia's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], which launched in 1920 and takes place in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania.

Several other parades have a loose association with Thanksgiving, thanks to [[CBS]]'s now-discontinued ''All-American Thanksgiving Day Parade'' coverage.

Since 1947, the [[National Turkey Federation]] has presented the President of the United States with one live turkey and two dressed turkeys, in a ceremony known as the [[National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation]]. [[John F. Kennedy]] was the first president reported to spare the turkey given to him (he said he did not plan to eat the bird), and [[Ronald Reagan]] was the first to grant the turkey a presidential [[pardon]], which he jokingly presented to his 1987 turkey. The turkey was then sent to a petting zoo.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

==Criticism and controversy==

Much like [[Columbus Day]], Thanksgiving is considered by some to be a "national day of mourning", as a celebration of the [[Native American genocide|genocide and conquest of Native Americans]] by colonists.<ref>McCray, Ashley Nicole; Ware, Lawrence (November 26, 2015). [http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/11/26/decolonizing-the-history-of-thanksgiving/ Decolonizing the History of Thanksgiving]. ''[[CounterPunch]]''.

''Los Angeles Times''. Thursday, November 26, 2015 :: latimes.com/California</ref> Professor Dan Brook of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] condemns the "cultural and political amnesia" of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving: "We do not have to feel guilty, but we do need to feel something."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2002/11/26/celebrating-genocide/ |title=Celebrating Genocide!|author= Brook, Dan |work=CounterPunch |date=November 26, 2002 |accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> Professor [[Robert W.

Those who sympathize with this view acknowledge it as a small minority view; author and humanist John G. Rodwan, who does not celebrate Thanksgiving, noted "If you put forth the interpretation (...) that touches on the dishonorable treatment of the native population that lived in what became the United States, then you are likely to be dismissed as some sort of crank(.)"<ref name="rodwan"/>

Since 1970, the [[United American Indians of New England]], a protest group led by Frank "Wamsutta" James has accused the United States and European settlers of fabricating the Thanksgiving story and of whitewashing a genocide and injustice against Native Americans, and it has led a [[National Day of Mourning (United States protest)|National Day of Mourning]] protest on Thanksgiving at [[Plymouth Rock]] in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] in the name of social equality and in honor of [[political prisoner]]s.<ref name="Occupy.com">{{cite web | url=http://www.occupy.com/article/thanksgiving-national-day-mourning-native-peoples-historic-massachusetts-town | title=Thanksgiving is National Day of Mourning for people in historic New England town | publisher=occupy.com | date=November 28, 2013 | accessdate=February 13, 2014 | author=Carter, Matt}}</ref>

On November 27, 1969, as another notable example of anti-Thanksgiving sentiment, hundreds of supporters traveled to [[Alcatraz]] on Thanksgiving Day to celebrate the [[Occupation of Alcatraz]] (which had started a week earlier and lasted until 1971) by [[Occupation of Alcatraz|Native Americans of All Tribes]]. The [[American Indian Movement]] and the [[Native American Church]] ([[peyote]] religion) both also hold a negative view of Thanksgiving; the AIM has used it as a platform for protest, most notably when they took over a ''[[Mayflower]]'' float in a Thanksgiving Day parade.<ref>{{cite web|author=DeShonda |url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/5950/American-Indian-Movement-AIM.html |title= American Indian Movement (AIM)—AIM'S BACKGROUND, EARLY AIM ACTIVISM, AIM AND ATHLETIC MASCOTS, EXPANDING THE AIM MISSION |publisher=Encyclopedia.jrank.org |date=May 9, 1973 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}</ref> Some Native Americans hold "[[Unthanksgiving Day]]" celebrations in which they mourn the deaths of their ancestors, fast, dance, and pray.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thanks, or no Thanksgiving|url=http://www.americanrivercurrent.com/2.7848/thanks-or-no-thanksgiving-1.1107614?pagereq=2|accessdate=November 14, 2017|publisher=American River Current|date=November 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707133425/http://www.americanrivercurrent.com/2.7848/thanks-or-no-thanksgiving-1.1107614?pagereq=2|archive-date=July 7, 2011}}</ref> This tradition has been taking place since 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/itvs/alcatrazisnotanisland/activism.html |title=Alcatraz Is Not An Island |publisher=PBS.org |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref>

The perception of Thanksgiving among Native Americans is not, however, universally negative. [[Tim Giago]], founder of the Native American Journalists Organization, seeks to reconcile Thanksgiving with Native American traditions. He compares Thanksgiving to "wopila", a thanks-giving celebration practiced by [[Great Plains Tribes|Native Americans of the Great Plains]]. He wrote in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'': "The idea of a day of Thanksgiving has been a part of the Native American landscape for centuries. The fact that it is also a national holiday for all Americans blends in perfectly with Native American traditions." He also shares personal anecdotes of Native American families coming together to celebrate Thanksgiving.<ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite news | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-giago/a-day-to-give-thanks-is-a_b_786399.html | title=A Day to Give Thanks is part of Native American Tradition | work=HuffPost | date=November 17, 2011 | accessdate=November 18, 2011 | last=Giago | first=Tim}}</ref>

In the early part of the twentieth century, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Atheism]] (4A) opposed the celebration of Thanksgiving Day, offering an alternative observance called Blamegiving Day, which was in their eyes, "a protest against Divine negligence, to be observed each year on Thanksgiving Day, on the assumption, for the day only, that God exists".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-hateful-history-of-blamegiving-day-the-most-bitter-godless-holiday-of-all-time|title=The Hateful History of Blamegiving Day, the Most Bitter, Godless Holiday of All Time|last=Cheadle|first=Harry|date=November 25, 2013|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref> Citing their view of the [[separation of church and state]], some [[atheist]]s in recent times have particularly criticized the annual recitation of Thanksgiving proclamations by the President of the United States, because these proclamations often revolve around the theme of giving thanks to God.<ref name=Separation>{{cite news|title=Thanksgiving: A Violation of the Separation of Church and State?|url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/susan_jacoby/2008/11/thanksgiving.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>

The move by retailers to begin holiday sales during Thanksgiving Day (as opposed to the traditional day after) has been criticized as forcing (under threat of being fired) low-end retail workers, who compose an increasing share of the nation's workforce, to work odd hours and to handle atypical, unruly crowds on a day reserved for rest.<ref name="gray2">{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec12/shopping_11-22.html |title=How 'Black Friday' Morphed Into 'Gray Thursday' |last=Sreenivasan |first=Hari |date=November 22, 2012 |accessdate=November 23, 2012 |work=PBS |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123124251/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec12/shopping_11-22.html |archive-date=November 23, 2012 }}</ref> In response to this controversy, [[Macy's]] and [[Best Buy]] (both of which planned to open on Thanksgiving, even earlier than they had the year before) stated in 2014 that most of their Thanksgiving Day shifts were filled voluntarily by employees who would rather have the day after Thanksgiving off instead of Thanksgiving itself.<ref>Gustafson, Krystina (October 14, 2014).

Journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]] and producer [[David Lowe (producer)|David Lowe]] deliberately chose Thanksgiving weekend 1960 to release Murrow's final story for [[CBS News]].

==Date==

Since being fixed on the fourth Thursday in November by law in 1941,<ref name=5USC87b /> the holiday in the United States can occur on any date from November 22 to 28. When it falls on November 22 or 23, it is not the last Thursday, but the penultimate Thursday in November. Regardless, it is the Thursday preceding the last Saturday of November.

Because Thanksgiving is a [[public holidays in the United States|federal holiday]], all United States government offices are closed and all employees are paid for that day. It is also a holiday for the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and most other financial markets and financial services companies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Holiday Schedule – Holiday Schedule – SIFMA|url=https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/holiday-schedule/|access-date=November 22, 2020|website=www.sifma.org}}</ref>

===Table of dates (1985–2029)===

The date of Thanksgiving Day follows a 28-year cycle, broken only by century years that are not also a multiple of 400 (2100, 2200, 2300, 2500{{nbsp}}...). The cycle break is an effect of the [[Leap year#Algorithm|leap year algorithm]], which dictates that such years are [[common year]]s as an adjustment for the calendar-season alignment that leap years provide. Past and future dates of celebration include:<ref name=dates>see e.g. {{cite web|title=TimeandDate.com|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/ }} and "[http://calendarhome.com/print-a-calendar/ CalendarHome.com]" retrieved December 1, 2014</ref>
