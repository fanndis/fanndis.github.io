'''Anuna De Wever''' (born 16 June 2001)<ref name="age"/> is a Belgian [[climate activist]] and was one of the leading figures in the [[School strike for the climate]] movement in Belgium.

== Early life and activism ==
De Wever was born in [[Mortsel]], Belgium. With [[Kyra Gantois]] and [[Adélaïde Charlier]], De Wever became one of the leading figures in the [[School strike for climate]] movement in Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belgium climate protests |website=[[BBC News]] |date=2019-01-31 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47070853 |access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref> As a result, from February to May 2019 they had a weekly column in the magazine ''[[HUMO]].''

In aftermath of the school strikes in Belgium centre-right [[Flemish Government|Flemish]] minister for the environment [[Joke Schauvliege]] was obliged to resign after falsely claiming that the [[State Security Service (Belgium)|Belgian State Security Service]] had information indicating that the climate strike was a political front organisation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/belgian-environment-minister-joke-schauvliege-claimed-children-climate-protests-a-set-up|title=Belgian minister resigns over school-strike conspiracy claims|author=Daniel Boffey|date=5 February 2019|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Belgian minister Schauvliege resigns over 'school protest plot' |website=[[BBC News]]|date=2019-02-06 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47141898 |access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref>

Personal differences led to a fissure within the Belgian Youth for Climate movement, with the departure of co-founder Kyra Gantois in August 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20190826_04575649|title=‘Het boterde al maanden niet meer tussen Anuna en mij’|author=Eline Bergmans|date=26 August 2019|newspaper=[[De Standaard]]}}</ref>

De Wever made an appearance at the 2019 [[Pukkelpop]] [[music festival]] attempting to engage the audience to call attention to the climate issues. This call angered some festival goers who harassed their group, hurled bottles of urine at them, and followed them back to their campsite, uttered death threats and destroyed their tent, forcing security to intervene.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/64152/anune-de-wever-harassed-and-threatened-to-death-at-pukkelpop/|title=Anuna De Wever harassed and threatened with death at Pukkelpop|date=16 August 2019|newspaper=[[The Brussels Times]]}}</ref> Because the attackers had been carrying a variant of the [[Flag of Flanders]] favoured by far-right elements of the [[Flemish Movement]], the organizers banned such flags from the event, confiscating 20.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pukkelpop onderzoekt incident op camping na klimaatactie met Anuna De Wever |author1=Amber Janssens |author2=Rik Arnoudt |date=16 August 2019 |website=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT Nieuws]] |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/08/16/muziekfestival-pukkelpop-onderzoekt-incident-op-de-camping-na-c/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Climate activist Anuna De Wever targeted in Pukkelpop incident, "black" Flemish lion flags seized|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2019/08/17/climate-activist-anuna-de-wever-targeted-in-pukkelpop-incident/|date=17 August 2019|author=Michaël Torfs|website=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT Nieuws]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/pukkelpop-verwijdert-vlaamse-vlaggen-nadat-anuna-de-wever-werd-belaagd/article-news-1498125.html|title=Pukkelpop verwijdert Vlaamse vlaggen nadat Anuna De Wever werd belaagd|date=16 August 2019|magazine=[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]]}}</ref>

In October 2019, De Wever was among the youngest climate activists to set sail on the ''[[Regina Maris (schooner)#Regina Maris: 1978|Regina Maris]]'' for a low-carbon trans-Atlantic journey to the [[2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Activists set sail across the Atlantic to Chile to demand curbs on flying|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/02/activists-set-sail-across-the-atlantic-to-chile-to-demand-curbs-on-flying|author=Jennifer Rankin|date=2 October 2019|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>
