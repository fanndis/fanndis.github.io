'''Reddit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|d|ɪ|t}}, stylized in its logo as '''reddit''') is an American [[social news]] [[news aggregator|aggregation]], web content [[rating site|rating]], and [[Internet forum#Discussion|discussion]] website.

Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called "subreddits", which cover a variety of topics such as news, politics, science, movies, video games, music, books, sports, fitness, cooking, pets, and image-sharing. Submissions with more up-votes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough up-votes, ultimately on the site's front page. Despite strict rules prohibiting harassment, Reddit's administrators spend considerable resources on moderating the site.<ref name=Ohlheiser/>

As of October 2020, Reddit ranks as the 17th-most-visited website in the world and 7th most-visited website in the US, according to [[Alexa Internet]], with 40.9% of its user base coming from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom at 10.0% and Canada at 5.2%.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com |title= Reddit Competitive Analysis, Marketing Mix and Traffic | publisher= [[Alexa Internet]] |accessdate=October 3, 2020}}</ref>

As a network of communities, Reddit's core content consists of posts from its users.<ref name="Nicol18"/><ref name="Franco17"/> Users can comment on others' posts to continue the conversation.<ref name="Nicol18"/> A key feature to Reddit is that users can cast positive or negative votes, called upvotes and downvotes respectively, for each post and comment on the site.<ref name="Nicol18"/> The number of upvotes or downvotes determines the posts' visibility on the site, so the most popular content is displayed to the most people.<ref name="Nicol18"/> Users can also earn "karma" for their posts and comments, a status that reflects their standing within the community and their contributions to Reddit.<ref name="Nicol18"/>

==== Internet privacy, neutrality and anonymity ====
Reddit users have been engaged in the defense of [[Internet privacy]], [[net neutrality]] and [[Internet anonymity]].

==== "Restoring Truthiness" campaign ====
As a response to [[Glenn Beck]]'s August 28, 2010, [[Restoring Honor rally]], in September 2010 Reddit users started a movement to persuade satirist [[Stephen Colbert]] to have a counter-rally in Washington, D.C.<ref name="Colbert Rally">{{cite news|last=Friedman |first=Megan |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/09/14/reddit-campaign-for-colbert-rally-breaks-charity-records/ |title=Reddit Campaign for Colbert Rally Breaks Donation Record |publisher=Time NewsFeed |date=September 14, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> The movement, which came to be called "Restoring Truthiness", was started by user mrsammercer, in a post where he described waking up from a dream in which Stephen Colbert was holding a satirical rally in D.C.<ref>{{cite web|author=mrsammercer |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/d7ntl/ive_had_a_vision_and_i_cant_shake_it_colbert/ |title=I've had a vision and I can't shake it: Colbert needs to hold a satirical rally in DC |website=Reddit |date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> Over $600,000 was raised for charity to gain the attention of Colbert.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} The campaign was mentioned on-air several times, and when the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] was held in Washington, D.C. on October 30, 2010, thousands of redditors made the journey.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schiraldi |first=Mike |url=https://redditblog.com/2010/11/buy-shirts-remember-rally-question.html |title=Buy Shirts, Remember the Rally, Question Colbert, and Smile |publisher=blog.reddit |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>

During a post-rally press conference, Reddit co-founder Ohanian asked, "What role did the Internet campaign play in convincing you to hold this rally?" [[Jon Stewart]] responded by saying that, though it was a very nice gesture, he and Colbert had already thought of the idea and the deposit for using the [[National Mall]] was already paid during the summer, so it acted mostly as a "validation of what we were thinking about attempting".<ref>[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-and-stephen-colbert-hold-post-rally-to-restore-sanity-press-conference/ Rally to Restore Sanity – Press Conference – Video] [[Mediaite]].

=== Community traditions ===
==== April Fools' Day ====
{{Main|The Button (Reddit)|Place (Reddit)}}
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2015, a [[social experiment]] subreddit called r/thebutton appeared. It displayed a button and a 60-second countdown timer. User accounts created before that day were eligible to participate. A user could only click the button once, or opt not to click it. If a user clicked the button the timer was globally reset to 60 seconds,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8383165/reddit-button-explained|title=The button: the fascinating social experiment driving Reddit crazy|first1=Timothy |last1=Lee |date=April 14, 2015 |website=Vox |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> and the user's "flair" (an icon next to the user's name) changed color. Colors were assigned based on a gradient from purple to red with purple signifying up to 60 seconds and red as low as 0 seconds. The countdown reached zero several times due to technical problems but eventually expired without further problems on June 5, 2015, after which the subreddit was archived.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redditblog.com/2015/06/the-button-has-ended.html|title=The button has ended|author=powerlanguage |date=June 8, 2015|website=Reddit}}</ref>

For April Fools' Day 2016, another experiment was launched involving the "Robin" chat widget. After clicking a titular button, an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]-like chat window was opened with one other user, and allowed a certain time to pick among three options: "Grow", "Stay" and "Leave".<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-robin-what-it-is-and-how-it-works-2016-4 "Reddit's 'Robin' is a brilliant social experiment that pits millions of internet users against each other"] ''Business Insider'' April 1, 2016</ref> "Grow" would join the chat with another group, "Stay" would close the group chat and create a subreddit with that group as moderators and "Leave" would close the group chat.

April Fools' Day 2017 featured a social experiment based on r/place. The subreddit contained a collaborative [[pixel]] art canvas, where a user could place a pixel every five minutes (the timer was temporarily ten and twenty minutes for a few hours on April 1).<ref>{{cite news|title=Reddit's new 'Place' is forcing millions of users to work together to make something great|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/reddit-place-april-fools-experiment-canvas-2017-3?r=US&IR=T|accessdate=April 1, 2017|website=Business Insider|language=en}}</ref> Many people worked together to create large graphics, such as flags or symbols. Often subreddits would come together as a group to add a graphic from that community to place. Place was closed on April 3, 2017, at 1:00 PM [[GMT]] having been active for a full three days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Place has ended|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/6382bb/place_has_ended/|website=Reddit|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref>

For April Fools' Day' 2018, an experiment launched on the subreddit r/circleoftrust.<ref>{{cite web |title=Looking back at r/CircleofTrust |url=https://redditblog.com/2018/05/22/looking-back-at-r-circleoftrust/ |website=Upvoted |publisher=Reddit |accessdate=July 22, 2018}}</ref> Upon clicking a button, each user was given one "circle" that they could entrust to others with the circle's password key to unlock and join the circle. While each user received one personal circle, they could join or betray any other user circles. Clicking the "join" button on another's circle would cause the owner's circle to grow bigger, while the "betray" button would cause the owner's circle to no longer function (having "betrayed" the owner's trust). On the r/circleoftrust subreddit, all users have a "flair" next to their username that displays the number of users who've joined their personal circle, followed by the number of other circles the user has joined. Those who had betrayed another user's circle have a [[null sign]] ("∅") next to their numbered flair. The experiment ended on April 6, 2018.

On April Fools' Day 2019, a social experiment subreddit called r/sequence was released. The experiment consisted of a community-driven sequencer that users interacted with by submitting GIFs or text slides to be compiled into a movie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/reddit-sequence-april-fools-day-1383519|title=Reddit Sequence is the latest April Fool's Day experiment from the social media forum|last=EDT|first=Steven Asarch On 4/2/19 at 11:50 AM|date=April 2, 2019|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=April 4, 2019}}</ref> The order of the GIFs and text slides were chosen by users through upvoting one GIF or text slide per scene. The most upvoted GIF or text slide was locked into the next available scene for every three minutes. At the end, once the entire sequence was filled, it was posted as a full story in an external page. The experiment ended at April 3, 2019, 11:08 PM GMT.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/sequence/comments/b95466/sequence_is_over/|title=Sequence is over|website=Reddit|date=April 3, 2019}}</ref>

During April Fools' Day 2020, r/imposter was released. Users were to identify a machine-generated response from a group of responses to the question "What makes you human?" (and, later, "What makes you an imposter?") and had an option to respond to the question after doing so. The experiment ended on April 3, 2020.
