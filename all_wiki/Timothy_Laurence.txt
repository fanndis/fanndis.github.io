==Marriage==
Laurence met [[Princess Anne]] when he served as an equerry to [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1986, at a time when it was widely rumoured that her first marriage to Captain [[Mark Phillips]] was breaking down. In 1989, the existence of private letters from Laurence to the Princess was revealed by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, though it did not name the sender. Buckingham Palace issued a statement: "The stolen letters were addressed to the Princess Royal by Commander Timothy Laurence, the Queen's Equerry. We have nothing to say about the contents of personal letters sent to Her Royal Highness by a friend which were stolen and which are the subject of a police investigation."<ref name="People-Romance">{{cite magazine|url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-a-crisis-rocks-a-royal-marriage-vol-31-no-16/|title=A Crisis Rocks a Royal Marriage|magazine=People|date=24 April 1989|accessdate=13 May 2018|first=Joanne|last=Kaufman|first2=Jonathan|last2=Cooper}}</ref>

Laurence and Princess Anne were married on 12 December 1992 in a [[Church of Scotland]] ceremony at [[Crathie Kirk|Crathie Parish Church]], [[Ballater]], near [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] (the Church of Scotland permits second marriages for divorced people). He received no [[peerage]] on marriage, but was made a [[personal aide-de-camp]] to the Queen in 2008 and invested in June 2011 as a [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission appoints new Commissioner|date=11 July 2011|url=http://nds.coi.gov.uk/Content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=420345&SubjectId=15&DepartmentMode=true|accessdate=30 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323143956/http://nds.coi.gov.uk/Content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=420345&SubjectId=15&DepartmentMode=true|archivedate=23 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Princess Anne kept her country estate, [[Gatcombe Park]] in [[Gloucestershire]], after her divorce from Mark Phillips. After they were married, she and Laurence leased, as their London residence, a [[apartment|flat]] in the [[Dolphin Square]] complex in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]]. They later returned to apartments in Buckingham Palace and now have an apartment at [[St James's Palace]].<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/Today.aspx The Royal Residences – St. James's Palace – Royal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309035640/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/Today.aspx |date=9 March 2009 }}</ref>
