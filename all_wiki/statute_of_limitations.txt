{{short description|Law which sets a maximum time for the initiation of legal proceedings}}
A '''statute of limitations''', known in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems as a '''prescriptive period''', is a law passed by a legislative body to set the maximum time after an event within which [[legal proceeding]]s may be initiated.<ref name=cal>{{cite web|title=Statute of Limitations|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/9618.htm|website=California Court Judicial Branch|publisher=Public Access Records|access-date=6 June 2014|ref=California Code of Civil Procedure sections 312–366}}</ref>

When the time specified in a statute of limitations passes, a claim might no longer be filed or, if filed, may be subject to dismissal if the defense against that claim is raised that the claim is time-barred as having been filed after the statutory limitations period. When a statute of limitations expires in a criminal case, the courts no longer have jurisdiction. Most crimes that have statutes of limitations are distinguished from serious crimes as these may be brought at any time.<ref name="hate crime acts"/>

In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, such provisions are typically part of their [[civil code|civil]] or [[criminal code]]s. The [[cause of action]] dictates the statute of limitations, which can be reduced (or extended) to ensure a fair trial.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Special Historic Session|title=Opening Remarks:HistoricSpecial section|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/compsum2.pdf|website=www.courts.ca.gov|publisher=Supreme Court Of California|access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref> The intention of these laws is to facilitate resolution within a "reasonable" length of time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=California Courts|first1=Judicial Council|title=Public Access Records|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-start.htm|website=California Courts|publisher=Rewriting Amendments|access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref> What amount of time is considered "reasonable" varies from country to country.<ref name=el>{{cite web|title=Statute of Limitations by State for Civil Cases|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/limitations_by_state/index.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|access-date=4 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=State Statutes of Limitations|url=http://statelaws.findlaw.com/statutes-of-limitations.html|website=FindLaw|publisher=Thomson Reuters|access-date=4 May 2017}}</ref> In the [[United States]], it may vary from state to state.<ref name="el" /> Within countries, the statute of limitations may vary from one civil or criminal action to another. Some countries have no statute of limitations whatsoever.

Analysis of a statute of limitations also requires the examination of any associated [[statute of repose]], tolling provisions, and exclusions.

==Applications==
Common law legal systems can include a statute specifying the length of time within which a claimant or prosecutor must file a case. In some civil jurisdictions (e.g., [[California]]),<ref name=cal/> a case cannot begin after the period specified, and courts have no jurisdiction over cases filed after the statute of limitations has expired. In some other jurisdictions (e.g., [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]), a claim can be filed which may prove to have been brought outside the limitations period, but the court will retain jurisdiction in order to determine that issue, and the onus is on the defendant to plead it as part of their defence, or else the claim will not be statute barred.

Once filed, cases do not need to be resolved within the period specified in the statute of limitations.

==Purpose==
The purpose and effect of statutes of limitations are to protect defendants. There are three reasons for their enactment:<ref>''Halsbury's Laws of England'', 4th edition</ref> 
* A plaintiff with a valid cause of action should pursue it with reasonable diligence.
* By the time a stale claim is litigated, a defendant might have lost evidence necessary to disprove the claim.
* Litigation of a long-dormant claim may result in more cruelty than justice.

In [[Classical Athens]], a five-year statute of limitations was established for all cases except [[homicide]] and the prosecution of non-constitutional laws (which had no limitation). [[Demosthenes]] wrote that these statutes of limitations were adopted to control "[[sycophant]]s" (professional accusers).<ref name="Allen2003">{{cite book|last=Allen |first=Danielle S. |title=The World of Prometheus: The Politics of Punishing in Democratic Athens |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKW3yiINadEC&pg=PA154 |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-09489-2 |page=154}}</ref>

The limitation period generally begins when the plaintiff's cause of action accrues, meaning the date upon which the plaintiff is first able to maintain the cause of action in court, or when the plaintiff first becomes aware of a previous injury (for example, [[occupational lung disease]]s such as [[asbestosis]]).

==Statute of repose==
{{Main|Statute of repose}}
A [[statute of repose]] limits the time within which an action may be brought based upon when a particular event occurred (such as the completion of construction of a building or the date of purchase of manufactured goods), and does not permit extensions. A statute of limitations is similar to a statute of repose, but may be extended for a variety of reasons (such as the [[age of majority|minority]] of the victim).

For example, most U.S. jurisdictions have passed statutes of repose for construction defects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statutes of Repose for Construction|url=http://www.sdvlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Statutes-of-Repose.pdf|website=SDVLaw.com|publisher=Saxe Doernberger & Vita, P.C.|access-date=4 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MCL 600.5839|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-600-5839|website=Michigan Legislature|publisher=State of Michigan|access-date=4 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cal.

After the statutory time period has passed, without regard to the nature or degree of the builder's negligence or misconduct, the statute of repose presents an absolute defense to the claim.

Statutes of repose are sometimes controversial; manufacturers contend that they are necessary to avoid unfair litigation and encourage consumers to maintain their property. Alternatively, consumer advocates argue that they reduce incentives to manufacture durable products and disproportionately affect the [[poverty|poor]], because manufacturers will have less incentive to ensure low-cost or "bargain" products are manufactured to exacting safety standards.

==Tolling and the discovery rule==
{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=August 2015}}
{{Further|Tolling (law)|discovery (law)}}
Many jurisdictions [[tolling (law)|toll]] or suspend the limitation period under certain circumstances such as if the aggrieved party (plaintiff) was a minor or filed a [[bankruptcy]] proceeding. In those instances, the running of limitations is tolled, or paused, until the condition ends. [[Equitable tolling]] may also be applied if an individual may intimidate a plaintiff into not reporting or has been promised a suspended period.

The statute of limitations may begin when the harmful event, such as fraud or injury, occurs or when it is discovered. The US Supreme Court has described the "standard rule" of when the time begins as "when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action." The rule has existed since the 1830s.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17933875001306187435&scilh=0 Gabelli v. Securities and Exchange Commission].</ref> A "discovery rule" applies in other cases (including [[medical malpractice]]), or a similar effect may be applied by tolling.

As discussed in ''Wolk v. Olson'', the discovery rule does not apply to mass media such as newspapers and the Internet; the statute of limitations begins to run at the date of publication. In 2013, the US Supreme Court of the United States unanimously ruled in ''[[Gabelli v. SEC]]'' that the discovery rule does not apply to [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]'s investment-advisor-fraud lawsuits since one of the purposes of the agency is to root out fraud.<ref>Macy J. (2013). [http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=160227 Opinion analysis: That which does not kill the SEC may make the agency stronger]. [[SCOTUSblog]].</ref>

In private civil matters, the limitation period may generally be shortened or lengthened by agreement of the parties. Under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], the parties to a contract for sale of goods may reduce the limitation period to one year but not extend it.

Limitation periods that are known as [[laches (equity)|laches]] may apply in situations of [[equity (law)|equity]]; a judge will not issue an [[injunction]] if the requesting party waited too long to ask for it. Such periods are subject to broad [[judicial discretion]].

For [[US military]] cases, the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) states that all charges except those facing [[court-martial]] on a [[capital punishment|capital charge]] have a five-year statute of limitations. If the charges are dropped in all UCMJ proceedings except those headed for general court-martial, they may be reinstated for six months after which the statute of limitations has run out.

==Prescription==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
{{Main|Extinctive prescription}}
In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, almost all lawsuits must be brought within a legally-determined period at the end of which the right of action is extinguished. This is known as liberative or extinctive prescription. Under Italian<ref>{{cite web|title=La prescrizione del reato dopo la ex-Cirielli|url=http://www.diritto-penale.it/la-prescrizione-del-reato.htm|work=Diritto Penale|access-date=5 June 2013}}</ref> and Romanian law,<ref>{{cite web|title=Codul Penal, Articolul 180 – Prescripția|url=http://legeaz.net/cod-penal-actualizat-2011/art-122-cpen|access-date=9 October 2013}}</ref> criminal trials must be ended within a time limit.

In criminal cases, the public prosecutor must lay charges within a time limit which varies by jurisdiction and varies based on the nature of the charge; in many jurisdictions, there is no statute of limitations for [[murder]].<ref name="hate crime acts"/> Over the last decade of the 20th century, many United States jurisdictions significantly lengthened the statute of limitations for sex offenses, particularly against children, as a response to research and popular belief that a variety of causes can delay the recognition and reporting of crimes of this nature.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Common triggers for suspending the prescription include a defendant's fugitive status or the commission of a new crime. In some jurisdictions, a criminal may be convicted [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ridley|first1=Yvonne|title=Bush Convicted of War Crimes in Absentia|url=http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2012/05/12/bush-convicted-of-war-crimes-in-absentia/|website=www.foreignpolicyjournal.com|publisher=Foreign Policy Journal|access-date=12 October 2014|date=2012-05-12}}</ref> Prescription should not be confused with the need to prosecute within "[[Laches (equity)|a reasonable delay]]" as obligated by the [[European Court of Human Rights]]{{cn|date=December 2019}}.

==Laws by region==

===International crimes===
Under [[international law]], [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]] are usually not subject to the statute of limitations as codified in a number of multilateral [[Treaty|treaties]].<ref>Kohout, David, ''Statutory Limitation of Crimes under International Law: Lessons Taken from the Prosecution of Nazi Criminals in Germany after 1945 and the New Demjanjuk Case Law'', International Comparative Jurisprudence, Vol. 3, Issue 1 (2017), pp. 37-54.</ref> States [[Ratification|ratifying]] the [[Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity]] agree to disallow limitations claims for these crimes. In Article 29 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes "shall not be subject to any statute of limitations".

===Germany===
In Germany, the statute of limitations on crimes varies by type of crime, with the highest being 30 years for voluntary manslaughter (Totschlag).  Murder, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crime of aggression have no statute of limitations.

Murder used to have 20 years' statute of limitations, which was then extended to 30 years in 1969. The limitations were abolished altogether in 1979, to prevent Nazi criminals from avoiding criminal liability.

For most other criminal offences, the statute of limitations is set by Section 78(3) of the Criminal Code ([[Strafgesetzbuch]]) as follows:

* 30 years for offences punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment for life;
* 20 years for offences punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of over 10 years but not by imprisonment for life;
* 10 years for offences punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of over 5 years but no more than 10 years;
* 5 years for offences punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of over 1 year but no more than 5 years;
* 3 years for all other offences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/index.html|title=GERMAN CRIMINAL CODE|website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}</ref>

In the civil code ([[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]), the regular statute of limitations is three years (plus the time until the end of the calendar year); however, different terms between two and thirty years may apply in specific situations. For example, the term is only two years for claims for alleged defects of purchased goods, but 30 years for claims resulting from a court judgement (such as awarded damages).

===India===
The statute of limitations in India is defined by the Limitations Act, 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comtax.up.nic.in/Miscellaneous%20Act/limitation-act-1963.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - LIMITATION ACT |access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>

The statute of limitations for criminal offences is governed by Sec. 468 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

===Ireland===

===Norway===
The statute of limitations on murder was abolished by a change in law on 1 July 2014, causing any murders committed after 1 July 1989 to have no statute of limitations. This led to the national police force implementing a new investigation group for old cases called the "Cold Case" group. The law was also changed to let cases involving domestic violence, forced marriage, human trafficking and genital mutilation to count from the day the defendant turns 18 years old. Cases where the statute of limitations has already passed can not be extended due to the constitution preventing it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/stortinget-fjerner-foreldelsesfristen-1.285858 |title=Stortinget fjerner foreldelsesfristen |language=no |publisher=Dagsavisen |date=2014-06-16 |access-date=2017-06-05}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Limitation periods in the UK|Limitation Act 1980}}
Unlike other European countries, the United Kingdom has no statute of limitations for any criminal offence, except for [[summary offences]] (offences tried in the magistrates’ court). In these cases, criminal proceedings must be brought within 6 months.

===United States===
In the United States, statutes of limitations apply to both civil lawsuits and criminal prosecutions.<ref name="hate crime acts">{{uscsub|18|249|d}} ("Statute of Limitations")</ref> Statutes of limitations vary significantly between U.S. jurisdictions.

====Retroactive extensions====
In ''[[Stogner v. California]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held by a 5–4 majority that [[California]]'s retroactive extension of the statute of limitations for [[sexual offense]]s committed against [[minor (law)|minor]]s was an unconstitutional [[ex post facto law]].<ref name=oyez>{{cite web |title=Stogner v.

====Civil statutes====
A civil statute of limitations applies to a non-criminal legal action, including a [[tort]] or [[contract]] case.<ref name=el/> If the statute of limitations expires before a lawsuit is filed, the defendant may raise the statute of limitations as an [[affirmative defense]] to seek dismissal of the charge. The exact time period depends on both the state and the type of claim (contract claim, personal injury, fraud etc.). Most fall in the range of one to ten years, with two to three years being most common.

====Criminal statutes====
A criminal statute of limitations defines a time period during which charges must be initiated for a criminal offense.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Doyle|first1=Charles|title=Statute of Limitation in Federal Criminal Cases: An Overview|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31253.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|access-date=18 March 2018|date=14 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="hate crime acts"/> If a charge is filed after the statute of limitations expires, the defendant may obtain dismissal of the charge.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Time Limits for Criminal Charges: What's the Statute of Limitations|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-statute-of-limitations|website=ExpertLaw|access-date=18 March 2018|date=27 February 2018}}</ref>

=====Initiation of charges=====
The statute of limitations in a criminal case only runs until a criminal charge is filed and a warrant issued, even if the defendant is a fugitive.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grossman|first1=Jonathan|title=Speedy Trial and the Statute of Limitations|url=http://www.sdap.org/downloads/research/criminal/jg14.pdf|website=Sixth District Appellate Program|access-date=6 December 2017|date=2014}}</ref>

When the identity of a defendant is not known, some jurisdictions provide mechanisms to initiate charges and thus stop the statute of limitations from running. For example, some states allow an indictment of a [[John Doe]] defendant based upon a DNA profile derived from evidence obtained through a criminal investigation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ullmer|first1=Frank B.|title=Using DNA Profiles to Obtain John Doe Arrest Warrants and Indictments|journal=Washington & Lee Law Review|date=2001|volume=58|page=1585|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/waslee58&div=52&id=&page=|access-date=6 December 2017}}</ref> Although rare, a [[grand jury]] can issue an [[indictment]] [[Trial in absentia|in absentia]] for high-profile crimes to get around an upcoming statute of limitations deadline. One example is the [[skyjacking]] of Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 by [[D.B. Cooper]] in 1971. The identity of D. B. Cooper remains unknown to this day, and he was indicted under the name "John Doe, aka Dan Cooper." <ref>Denson, Bryan (November 24, 1996). D.B. Cooper legend lives.

====Exceptions====
U.S. jurisdictions recognize exceptions to statutes of limitation that may allow for the prosecution of a crime or civil lawsuit even after the statute of limitations would otherwise have expired. Some states stop the clock for a suspect who is not residing within the state or is purposely hiding. Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina have no statutes of limitation for felonies, while Wyoming includes misdemeanors as well. However, the right to [[Speedy Trial Clause|speedy trial]] may derail any prosecution after many years have passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://resources.lawinfo.com/criminal-defense/criminal-statute-limitations-time-limits.html|title=Criminal Statutes of Limitations for All 50 States|website=resources.lawinfo.com}}</ref>

=====Fraud upon the court=====<!-- [[Fraud upon the court]] redirects to here -->
When an [[officer of the court]] is found to have fraudulently presented facts to impair the court's impartial performance of its legal task, the act (known as ''fraud upon the court'') is not subject to a statute of limitation.<ref>''Kenner v. C.I.R.'', [https://www.leagle.com/decision/19681076387f2d6891863 387 F.2d 689], 691 (7th Cir. 1968).</ref><ref name="Herring v.

Officer of the court in general includes any [[judge]], [[law clerk]], [[court clerk]], [[lawyer]], investigator, [[probation officer]], [[referee]], [[legal guardian]], parenting-time expeditor, mediator, evaluator, administrator, special appointee, and/or anyone else whose influence is part of the judicial mechanism.<ref name=DOJ>{{cite web|title=Deprivation Of Rights Under Color Of Law |url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/deprivation-rights-under-color-law |date=August 6, 2015 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) |access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref>

====={{anchor|Continuing violations doctrine}}Continuing-violations doctrine=====
In [[tort]] law, if any person or entity commits a series of illegal acts against another person or entity (or in criminal law if a defendant commits a continuing crime) the limitation period may begin to run from the last act in the series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Continuing Violation Doctrine Law and Legal Definition |url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/c/continuing-violation-doctrine/ |access-date=2019-01-24 |publisher=definitions.uslegal.com}} See also ''Egervary v.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] has explained that the continuing-violations doctrine "tolls the statute of limitations in situations where a continuing pattern forms due to discriminatory acts occurring over a period of time, as long as at least one incident of discrimination occurred within the limitations period."<ref>''Treanor v.
