'''Ebony Fashion Fair''' (also known as the '''Ebony Traveling Fashion Fair''') was an annual [[fashion]] event created by [[Eunice Johnson]], co–founder of the [[Chicago, Illinois]]–based [[Johnson Publishing Company]]. The show ran across the United States and other countries from 1958 until 2009. In addition to the fashion fair, the company also created a cosmetic line named '''Fashion Fair Cosmetics''', in 1973.  As of 2017, Fashion Fair Cosmetics are still available for purchase.
==History==
In 1956, [[John H. Johnson]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/john-h-johnson-020116|title=John H.

Reluctant to use the models featured in the magazines published by his company, Johnson instead offered to provide the clothing.  Johnson and Dent then came to an agreement: Johnson Publishing Company would supply the garments for the fundraiser, and, each ticket to enter the show would include a subscription to either ''Ebony''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/02/15/276987206/the-ebony-fashion-fair-changing-history-on-the-catwalk|title=The Ebony Fashion Fair: Changing History On The Catwalk|website=NPR.org|access-date=March 8, 2017|date=February 15, 2014}}</ref> or ''Jet Magazine—''both published by Johnson's company.

===Fashion Fair Cosmetics===
When Eunice Johnson noticed that the models at the Ebony Fashion Fair "were mixing foundations to create the right blend to match their hues", she initially approached existing cosmetics companies and asked them to develop make-up lines which would suit the specific needs of women of color. However, as she was met with resistance from the companies she approached, she and her husband, [[John H. Johnson]], created the Caspsule Collection: a small make-up compact in a mail-order package. Due to high-demand, the product led to the creation of a full cosmetic line named Fashion Fair Cosmetics, after the fashion show in 1973. According to [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], Fashion Fair Cosmetics was once the largest black-owned cosmetics company in the world.<ref name="Fortune Profile">{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Kristin |title=Can Fashion Fair Cosmetics Make a Comeback? |url=https://fortune.com/2019/09/17/can-fashion-fair-cosmetics-make-a-comeback/ |website=[[Fortune (magazine)| Fortune]] |accessdate=14 January 2020 |date=17 September 2019}}</ref> In April 2019, a United Kingdom creditor petitioned a judge to force the company to sell its Fashion Fair Cosmetics UK assets.<ref name=BAK>[https://chicagocrusader.com/johnson-publishing-files-for-bankruptcy/ Chicago Crusader (Johnson Publishing files for bankruptcy) April 11, 2019]</ref> In November 2019, the brand was acquired by Cheryl Mayberry McKissack and [[Desirée Rogers]].<ref name="Black Enterprise">{{cite web |last1=Clarke |first1=Caroline V. |title=Can the New Owners of Fashion Fair Give the Once-Iconic Brand a Business Makeover? |url=https://www.blackenterprise.com/new-owners-fashion-fair-iconic-brand-business-makeover/ |website=[[Black Enterprise]] |accessdate=14 January 2020 |date=14 November 2019}}</ref>
