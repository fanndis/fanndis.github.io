Andrews lived briefly with Ted Wells and her brother John<ref>GRO Register of Births: JUN 1938 2a 564 Surrey NW – John D. Wells, mmn = Morris</ref> in Surrey. In 1940, Ted Wells sent young Julia to live with her mother and stepfather, whom the elder Wells thought would be better able to provide for his talented daughter's artistic training. According to Julie Andrews' 2008 autobiography ''Home'', while Julie had been used to calling Ted Andrews "Uncle Ted", her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as "Pop", while her father remained "Dad" or "Daddy" to her. Julie disliked this change.

The Andrews family was "very poor" and they "lived in a bad [[slum]] area of London," Andrews recalled, adding, "That was a very black period in my life." According to Andrews, her stepfather was violent and an alcoholic.<ref name="Brockes2008-03-30" /> Ted Andrews twice, while drunk, tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door.<ref name="Brockes2008-03-30" /> As the stage career of Ted and Barbara Andrews improved, they were able to afford better surroundings, first to [[Beckenham]] and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews' hometown of [[Hersham]]. The Andrews family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (now demolished) where Andrews' maternal grandmother had served as a maid.<ref name="windeler20" />

Andrews' stepfather sponsored lessons for her, first at the independent arts educational school Cone-Ripman School (now known commonly as [[Arts Educational Schools, London|ArtsEd]]) in London, and thereafter with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame [[Lilian Stiles-Allen]]. "She had an enormous influence on me," Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, adding, "She was my third mother&nbsp;– I've got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world." In her memoir ''Julie Andrews – My Star Pupil'', Stiles-Allen records, "The range, accuracy and tone of Julie's voice amazed me ... she had possessed the rare gift of [[absolute pitch]]",<ref name= Stirling>{{cite book| last= Stirling| first= Richard| title= Julie Andrews: An Intimate Biography| publisher= Portrait| year= 2007 |isbn= 978-0-7499-5135-1}}</ref>{{rp|22}} though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography ''Home''.<ref name="spindle1" /><ref name="windeler22">Windeler (1970), pp. 22–23</ref> According to Andrews, "Madame was sure that I could do Mozart and Rossini, but, to be honest, I never was".<ref name= Stirling />{{rp|24}} Of her own voice, she says, "I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range – dogs would come from miles around."<ref name= Stirling />{{rp|24}} After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.<ref>{{cite book| first= Timothy| last= White | year= 1998| title= The Entertainers| page= 111| publisher= [[Billboard Books]]}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== Early career in Britain ===
Beginning in 1945, and for the next two years, Julie Andrews performed spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents. "Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening," Andrews explained. She would stand on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, sometimes a solo or as a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. "It must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right."<ref name="windeler23">Windeler (1970), pp 23–24</ref><ref>Spindle, p. 2, suggests that Andrews began a few years of stage work with her parents in 1946.</ref>

[[Petula Clark]] recalls touring round Britain by train to sing for the troops with Andrews, who was three years younger; they slept in the luggage racks. Clark said "It was fun—and not a lot of kids were having fun".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/31/petula-clark-elvis-angled-for-a-threesome-he-was-raring-to-go |title=Petula Clark: 'Elvis angled for a threesome – he was raring to go' |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Elle Hunt |date= 31 July 2019}}</ref>

Julie Andrews gained her big break when her stepfather introduced her to [[Val Parnell]], whose [[Moss Empires]] controlled prominent venues in London. At age 12, Andrews made her professional solo debut at the [[London Hippodrome]] singing the difficult aria "Je suis Titania" from ''[[Mignon]]'' as part of a musical revue called "Starlight Roof" on 22 October 1947. She played the Hippodrome for one year.<ref name="spindle1" /><ref>Windeler (1970), pp 24–26</ref> Of "Starlight Roof," Andrews recalled: "There was this wonderful American person and comedian, [[Wally Boag]], who made balloon animals. He would say, 'Is there any little girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these?' And I would rush up onstage and say, 'I'd like one, please.' And then he would chat to me and I'd tell him I sang... I was fortunate in that I absolutely stopped the show cold. I mean, the audience went crazy."<ref>Boag, Wally and Sands, Gene. ''Wally Boag, Clown Prince of Disneyland'', Disney Enterprises, Inc. 2009, p. 39</ref>

On 1 November 1948, Julie Andrews (aged 13) became the youngest solo performer ever to be seen in a [[Royal Variety Performance|Royal Command Variety Performance]] before [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] at the [[London Palladium]], where she performed along with [[Danny Kaye]], the [[Nicholas Brothers]], and the comedy team George and Bert Bernard.<ref>Windeler (1970), p. 26. "Julie, who was described in the official announcement 14 October as 'a 13-year-old coloratura soprano with the voice of an adult,' was the youngest solo performer ever chosen to perform before royalty at the Palladium. She sang the British National Anthem. She ran onto stage in front of Danny Kaye wearing a white A-frame dress and begins to sing, the audience join in. The evening was held in the presence of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (The Queen Mother). The show was presented by Val Parnell."</ref><ref name="spindle3">Spindle, p. 3</ref>

Julie Andrews followed her parents into radio and television.<ref name="windeler26">Windeler (1970), pp 26–27.</ref> She performed in musical interludes of the [[BBC Light Programme]] comedy show ''Up the Pole'' and later ''[[Educating Archie]]'', of which she was a cast member from 1950 to 1952.<ref name="spindle3" /> She reportedly made her television début on the BBC programme ''RadiOlympia Showtime'' on 8 October 1949.<ref>[http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Artists/Biography.aspx?ArtistGuid=3e58f21d-30b8-4e27-85f7-5b42cf61a03e Ruhlmann, William.

On 30 September 1954, on the eve of her 19th birthday, Julie Andrews made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut portraying Polly Browne in the already highly successful London musical ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]''.<ref name="BBC" /> To the critics, Andrews was the stand-out performer in the show.<ref name="spindle4">Spindle, pp. 4–5.</ref> Near the end of her ''Boy Friend'' contract, as a Londoner Andrews was asked to audition for the role of [[Cockney]] flower girl [[Eliza Doolittle]] in ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' on Broadway and got the part.<ref>{{Cite news|title=In Step With: Julie Andrews |work=Parade Magazine |date=17 October 2004 |url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2004/edition_10-17-2004/in_step_with_0 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In November 1955, Andrews was signed to appear with [[Bing Crosby]] in what one source calls the first [[television film|made-for-television film]], ''[[High Tor (play)|High Tor]]'', which aired on the ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'' in March 1956.<ref name="windeler41">Windeler, pp. 41–42.</ref>

Andrews auditioned for a part in the [[Richard Rodgers]] musical ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]''. Although Rodgers wanted her for ''Pipe Dream'', he advised her to take the part in the [[Frederick Loewe]] and [[Alan Jay Lerner]] musical ''My Fair Lady'' if it were offered to her. In 1956, she appeared on stage in ''My Fair Lady'' as Eliza Doolittle to [[Rex Harrison]]'s Henry Higgins. Rodgers was so impressed with Andrews' talent that concurrent with her run in ''My Fair Lady'' she was featured in the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] television musical, ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]''.<ref name="spindle4" />

In 1957, Andrews released her debut solo album, ''The Lass with the Delicate Air'', which harked back to her British music hall days.<ref name="Album">[http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-lass-with-the-delicate-air-mw0000583102 "The Lass with the Delicate Air"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515151620/http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-lass-with-the-delicate-air-mw0000583102 |date=15 May 2015 }}.

Between 1956 and 1962, Andrews guest-starred on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (15 July 1956), and also appeared on ''[[The Dinah Shore Chevy Show]]'', ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', ''[[The Bell Telephone Hour]]'' and ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. In June 1962, Andrews co-starred in ''[[Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall]]'', a CBS special with [[Carol Burnett]].

In 1960, Lerner and Loewe again cast her in a period musical as Queen [[Guinevere]] in ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', along with [[Richard Burton]] (as [[King Arthur]]) and newcomer [[Robert Goulet]]. However, because film studio head [[Jack L. Warner]] decided Andrews lacked sufficient name recognition for her casting in the film version of ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'', Eliza was instead played by the established film actress [[Audrey Hepburn]]. As Warner later recalled, the decision was easy, "In my business, I have to know who brings people and their money to a cinema box office. Audrey Hepburn had never made a financial flop."<ref>{{cite web | title=''My Fair Lady'' (1964) at Reel Classics | url=http://www.reelclassics.com/Musicals/Fairlady/fairlady.htm | accessdate=18 December 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220220233/http://www.reelclassics.com/Musicals/Fairlady/fairlady.htm | archive-date=20 December 2005 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Film stardom ===
[[File:Mary Poppins5.jpg|thumb|Andrews in ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964)]]
In 1963, Andrews began her work in the title role of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s musical film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''. [[Walt Disney]] had seen her performance as Queen Guinevere and thought she would be perfect for the role of the [[Mary Poppins (character)|British nanny]] who is "practically perfect in every way!" Andrews initially declined because of pregnancy, returning to London to give birth, but Disney firmly insisted, saying, "We'll wait for you."<ref name="MaryPoppinsDVD">''Mary Poppins'' 40th Anniversary Edition DVD.</ref>

''Mary Poppins'' became the biggest box-office draw in Disney history. Andrews won the 1964 [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] for her performance. She and her co-stars also won the 1965 [[Grammy Award for Best Album for Children]]. As a measure of "sweet revenge," as ''Poppins'' songwriter [[Sherman Brothers|Richard M.

Andrews continued working in television. In 1969, she shared the spotlight with singer [[Harry Belafonte]] for an NBC-TV special, ''An Evening with Julie Andrews and Harry Belafonte''. In 1971, she appeared as a guest for the Grand Opening Special of Walt Disney World, and that same year she and Carol Burnett headlined a CBS special, ''Julie and Carol At Lincoln Center''. In 1972–73, Andrews starred in her own television variety series, ''[[The Julie Andrews Hour]]'', on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network.

She made only two other films in the 1970s, ''[[The Tamarind Seed]]'' (1974) and ''[[10 (film)|10]]'' (1979), both successful at the box office and by critics reviews.

In February 1980, Andrews headlined "Because We Care", a CBS-TV special with 30 major stars raising funds for Cambodian Famine victims through Operation California (now Operation USA, on whose Board she serves). Later that year, she starred in ''[[Little Miss Marker (1980 film)|Little Miss Marker]]'' as "[[English rose (epithet)|English rose]]" Amanda Worthington (a label she had first been given in the 1960s).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pym |first1=John |title=Time Out Film Guide |date=1998 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=521}}</ref> In Blake Edwards' ''[[S.O.B.

[[File:Julie Andrews HWoF Star.jpg|thumb|Julie Andrews' star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
In December 1987, Andrews starred in an ABC Christmas special, ''Julie Andrews: The Sound Of Christmas'', which went on to win five Emmy Awards. Two years later, she was reunited for the third time with [[Carol Burnett]] for a variety special which aired on ABC in December 1989.

===Loss of singing voice===
Andrews was forced to quit the show towards the end of the Broadway run in 1997 when she developed hoarseness in her voice. She subsequently underwent surgery at New York's [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]], reportedly to remove non-cancerous [[Vocal fold nodule|nodules]] from her throat,<ref name="BBC" /> though she later stated the hoarseness was due to "a certain kind of muscular striation [that] happens on the vocal cords"—itself the result of a strain from ''Victor/Victoria'' (she added "I didn't have cancer, I didn't have nodules, I didn't have anything.")<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Sound of Music Reunion |series=[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] |date=28 October 2010 |season=25}}</ref> She emerged from the surgery with permanent damage that destroyed the purity of her singing and gave a rasp to her speaking voice. In 1999, she filed a malpractice suit against the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital, including Scott Kessler and Jeffrey Libin, who had operated on her throat. Originally, the doctors assured Andrews that she should regain her voice within six weeks, but Andrews' stepdaughter [[Jennifer Edwards]] said in 1999 "it's been two years, and it [her singing voice] still hasn't returned."<ref name="sue over lost voice">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/565852.stm ''Andrews sues over lost voice''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309045553/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/565852.stm |date=9 March 2008 }}.

Despite the loss of her singing voice, she kept busy with many projects. In 1998, she appeared in a stage production of ''Dr. Dolittle'' in London. As recounted on the Julie Andrews website, she performed the voice of Polynesia the parrot and "recorded some 700 sentences and sounds, which were placed on a computer chip that sat in the mechanical bird's mouth.

When a young Andrews was taken by her parents to be examined by a [[ENT specialist|throat specialist]], the doctor concluded that she had "an almost adult [[larynx]]."<ref name=":0" /> In spite of her voice teacher, English soprano [[Lilian Stiles-Allen]], having continually encouraged her to pursue opera, Andrews herself felt that her voice was unsuited for the genre and "too big a stretch". At the time, Andrews described her own voice as "extremely high and thin", feeling that it lacked "the necessary guts and weight for opera", preferring musical theatre instead. As she aged, so did her voice, which began to naturally deepen. Losing her vast upper register, her "top notes" became increasingly difficult to sing while "her middle register matured into the warm golden tone" for which she has become known, according to Tim Wong of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/timwong/100075040/julie-andrews-the-operatic-sensation-that-never-was/|title = Julie Andrews, the operatic sensation that never was|date = 26 May 2014|accessdate = 23 August 2014|website = The Daily Telegraphy|publisher = Telegraph Media Group Limited|last = Wong|first = Tim|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306122658/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/timwong/100075040/julie-andrews-the-operatic-sensation-that-never-was/|archive-date = 6 March 2016|url-status=dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Musically, Andrews had always preferred singing music that was "bright and sunny", choosing to avoid songs that were sad, depressing, upsetting, or written in a minor key, for fear of losing her voice "in a mess of emotion". She cited this as another reason for avoiding opera.<ref name=":0" />
