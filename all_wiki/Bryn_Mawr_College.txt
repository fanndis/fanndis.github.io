'''Bryn Mawr College''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|r|ɪ|n|ˈ|m|ɑː|r}} {{respell|brin|MAR|'}}; [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: {{IPA-cy|ˌbɾɨ̞nˈmau̯ɾ|}})<ref>Mackey & Mackey (1922) ''The Pronunciation of 10,000 Proper Names''; also example at [http://www.espeech.com/namepro.htm e-speech site]</ref> is a [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Founded as a [[Quaker]] institution in 1885, Bryn Mawr is one of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sister colleges]] and the [[Tri-College Consortium]]. The college has an enrollment of about 1,350 [[undergraduate student]]s and 450 [[graduate student]]s. It was the first women's college to offer graduate education through a PhD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brynmawr.edu/about/history|title=History {{!}} Bryn Mawr College|website=www.brynmawr.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref>

== History ==
Bryn Mawr College is a private women's liberal arts college founded in 1885. The phrase ''bryn mawr'' means "large hill" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]],<ref>Not "high hill", as is often mistakenly given as the translation; ''Bryn Uchel'' translates to "high hill"</ref> literally "hill (bryn) large (mawr)". The Graduate School is co-educational. It is named after the town of [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]], in which the campus is located, which had been renamed by a representative of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Bryn Mawr was the name of an area estate granted to [[Rowland Ellis]] by [[William Penn]] in the 1680s. Ellis's former home, also called Bryn Mawr, was a house near [[Dolgellau]], [[Merionethshire|Merioneth]], [[Gwynedd]], [[Wales]]. The College was largely founded through the bequest of [[Joseph W. Taylor]], and its first president was [[James Rhoads]]. Bryn Mawr was one of the first institutions of higher education in the United States to offer graduate degrees, including [[doctorate]]s, to women. The first class included 36 undergraduate women and eight graduate students. Bryn Mawr was originally affiliated with the [[Quakers]] (Religious Society of Friends), but by 1893 had become non-denominational.

In 1912, Bryn Mawr became the first college in the [[United States]] to offer doctorates in [[social work]], through the Department of Social Economy and Social Research. This department became the Graduate School of Social Work and Social Research in 1970. In 1931, Bryn Mawr began accepting men as graduate students, while remaining women-only at the undergraduate level.

From 1921 to 1938 the Bryn Mawr campus was home to the [[Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry]], which was founded as part of the labor education movement and the women's labor movement.  The school taught women workers political economy, science, and literature, as well as organizing many extracurricular activities.<ref>

A June 3, 2008, article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' discussed the move by [[women's colleges in the United States]] to promote their schools in the [[Middle East]]. The article noted that in doing so, the schools promote the work of alumnae of women's colleges such as [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Diane Sawyer]], [[Katharine Hepburn]] (Bryn Mawr Class of 1928) and [[Madeleine Albright]]. The Dean of Admissions of Bryn Mawr noted, "We still prepare a disproportionate number of women scientists [...] We’re really about the empowerment of women and enabling women to get a top-notch education." The article also contrasted the difference between women's colleges in the Middle East and "the American colleges [which] for all their white-glove history and academic prominence, are liberal strongholds where students fiercely debate political action, gender identity and issues like '[[heteronormativity]]', the marginalizing of standards that are other than heterosexual. Middle Eastern students who already attend these colleges tell of a transition that can be jarring."<ref>

== Campus ==
[[File:Entrance Bryn Mawr.JPG|thumb|Campus entrance]]
[[Image:Pembroke Hall at Bryn Mawr.jpg|right|thumb|Bryn Mawr's Pembroke Hall]]

The campus was designed in part by noted landscape designers [[Calvert Vaux]] and [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], and has subsequently been designated an [[arboretum]] (the [[Bryn Mawr Campus Arboretum]]). In 2011, [[Travel+Leisure]] named Bryn Mawr as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.<ref>[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/28 "America's most beautiful college campuses", ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)]</ref>

=== Student residences ===
The majority of Bryn Mawr students live on campus in residence halls. Many of the older residence halls were designed by [[Cope & Stewardson]] (same architects who designed a large part of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and [[Princeton University]]) and are known for their [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture, modeled after [[Cambridge University]]. Each is named after a [[county town]] in [[Wales]]: [[Brecon]], [[Denbigh]] (1891), Merion (1885), and [[New Radnor|Radnor]] (1887), and Pembroke East and West (1892). Rhoads North and South was named after the college's first president, James E. Rhoads; Rockefeller is named after its donor, [[John D. Rockefeller]]. Erdman was opened in 1965, designed by architect [[Louis Kahn]]. In addition, students may choose to live in Batten House (an environmentally friendly co-op). Perry House, which was originally established as the Spanish language house in 1962, was redefined as the Black Cultural Center in the 1970s. In 2015, Perry House was relaunched by the college in the former French tower of Haffner, which had undergone renovations and reconstruction the previous year.<ref name=BMCNow15>{{cite news |title=Saying Goodbye to Perry House While Looking Ahead to the "New Perry" |url=http://news.brynmawr.edu/2015/05/08/saying-goodbye-to-perry-house-while-looking-ahead-to-new-perry/ |work=Bryn Mawr Now |date=8 May 2015 |access-date=2 June 2015}}</ref> Along with Perry, now known as the [[Enid Cook de Rodaniche|Enid Cook]] '31 Center, a new residence hall was built where the old Haffner Language and Culture House once stood.

Glenmede (formerly graduate student housing) is an estate located about a half mile from the main campus which at one point was available housing for undergraduate students. In 2007, it was sold to a conservation buyer as the annual costs of upkeep were too great for the college.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120912180526/http://www.saveardmorecoalition.org/node/1694 Glenmede Saved From Destruction and Over-Development]. Save Ardmore Coalition (2005-10-13). Retrieved on 2011-06-18.</ref>

=== Libraries ===
Bryn Mawr's library holdings are housed in the Mariam Coffin Canaday Library (opened 1970), the Rhys Carpenter Library (opened 1997), and the Lois and Reginald Collier Science Library (opened 1993). TRIPOD, the online library catalog, automatically accesses holdings at [[Haverford College|Haverford]] and [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]].

=== Blanca Noel Taft Memorial Garden ===
In 1908, [[John C. Olmsted]] designed a private garden for [[M. Carey Thomas]] adjoining the [[Bryn Mawr College Deanery|Deanery]]. The garden was later modified and renamed as the Blanca Noel Taft Memorial Garden. In its current form, the garden is a small, serene enclosure with two wall fountains, one with a small basin and the other with a sunken reflecting pool. The decorative wall tiles above the smaller wall fountain and basin were purchased from [[Syria]].<ref>[http://www.brynmawr.edu/Library/exhibits/thomas/plan3.html Bryn Mawr College Campus Plan&nbsp;– John Olmsted].

=== Erdman Hall Dormitory ===
[[File:Erdman Bryn Mawr.JPG|thumb|Erdman Hall]]
In 1960, architect [[Louis I. Kahn]] and Bryn Mawr College president, [[Katharine Elizabeth McBride]], came together to create the Erdman Hall dormitory.<ref>{{cite journal |work=The Architecture Week's Great Building Collection |url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Erdman_Hall_Dormitories.html |title=Erdman Hall Dormitories}}</ref>

For over a year, Kahn and his assistants struggled to translate the college's design program of 130 student rooms and public spaces into a scheme (well documented by the letters written between McBride and Kahn).  The building comprises three geometrical square structures, connected at their corners. The outer walls are formed by interlocking student rooms around three inner public spaces: the entry hall, dining hall and living hall. These spaces receive light from towering light monitors.

=== Marjorie Walter Goodhart Theater ===
[[Image:Bryn Mawr Sunset.jpg|thumb|Sunset over Goodhart Hall]]
The Marjorie Walter Goodhart Theater houses a vaulted [[auditorium]] designed by [[Arthur Ingersoll Meigs]] of [[Mellor, Meigs & Howe]], two smaller spaces that are ideal for intimate performances by visiting artists, practice rooms for student musicians, and the Office for the Arts.  The building's towers and [[gable]]s, [[friezes]], carvings and ornamental ironwork, designed by [[Samuel Yellin]], were done in the [[gothic revival]] style.<ref>[http://www.brynmawr.edu/visit/guided_tour/goodhart.shtml Bryn Mawr College | Visiting Campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105230340/http://www.brynmawr.edu/visit/guided_tour/goodhart.shtml |date=2007-11-05 }}.

===Old Library (previously M. Carey Thomas Library and College Hall) ===
{{main|Old Library (Bryn Mawr College)}}
[[File:Thomas Great Hall at Bryn Mawr College.JPG|thumb|Interior of the Great Hall]]

Previously named after Bryn Mawr's first Dean and second president, Old Library was used as the primary campus [[library]] until 1970, when Mariam Coffin Canaday Library opened. The Great Hall (formerly the reading room of the library) was designed by Walter Cope (of [[Cope and Stewardson]]) in 1901 and built by Stewardson and Jamieson several years later, although [[M. Carey Thomas]] played a large part in its construction. Today, it is a space for performances, readings, lectures, and public gatherings. Old Library encloses a large open courtyard called "The [[Cloisters]]", which is the site of the College's traditional Lantern Night ceremony.  The [[cremated]] remains of M. Carey Thomas and [[Emmy Noether]] are located in the Cloisters. [[Georgiana Goddard King]] is also buried in the cloister.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Janice|title=Women Medievalists and the Academy|date=2005|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|page=121}}</ref> The building was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2117&ResourceType=Building |title=M.

=== Rhys Carpenter Art and Archaeology Library ===
[[File:Rhoads Hall Bryn Mawr.JPG|thumb|Rhoads Hall]]
Named for Bryn Mawr's late professor of Classical [[Archaeology]], the Rhys Carpenter Library was designed by Henry Myerberg of New York and opened in 1997.  The space is connected to the rear of the M. Carey Thomas Library. The entrance is a four-story [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. Names of art and archaeology faculty are displayed on the main wall of the atrium, along with a series of plaster casts of the metopes of the [[Parthenon]].  Most of the stacks, study areas, lecture halls and seminar rooms are located underground.  The roof comprises a wide grassy area used for outdoor concerts and picnics.  The building won a 2001 Award of Excellence for Library Architecture from the Library Administration and Management Association and the American Institute of Architects. Carpenter Library also houses the College's renowned collections in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology, History of Art, and Classics.<ref>[http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/speccoll/index.html Special Collections Website.

=== The Deanery ===
{{main|Bryn Mawr College Deanery}}
The [[Bryn Mawr College Deanery]] was the campus residence of the first Dean and second President of Bryn Mawr College, M. Carey Thomas, who maintained a home there from 1885 to 1933. Under the direction of Thomas, the Deanery was gradually enlarged and elaborately decorated with the assistance of the American artist [[Lockwood de Forest]] and furnished with art from Thomas' world travels. From 1933 until 1968, the Deanery served as the Alumnae Center and Inn for the college. The building was demolished in the spring of 1968 to make space for the construction of Canaday Library, which stands on the site today. At the time of its demolition, many of the Deanery's furnishings were re-located to Wyndham, an 18th-century farmhouse (with several modern additions) which became the college's new Alumnae Center.

== Organization ==
Bryn Mawr undergraduates largely govern themselves in academic and social matters via the Self-Government Association. A significant aspect of self-government is the Academic Honor System ([[honor code]]). The Honor Code is a set of principles that stress mutual respect and academic integrity. Students ratify the code each year, agree to adhere to it, and enforce its provisions.

Along with [[Haverford College]], Bryn Mawr forms the Bi-College Community. Students in the "Bi-Co" enjoy unlimited cross-registration privileges and may choose to major at the other institution. The two institutions join with [[Swarthmore College]] to form the Tri-College Consortium, opening the Swarthmore course catalog to interested Bryn Mawr students as well. Free shuttles are provided between the three campuses. There is the Blue Bus between Bryn Mawr and Haverford College, and a van, known to the students as the "Swat Van", that travels among the three colleges.

In addition, the College is affiliated with the [[University of Pennsylvania]] through a special association known as the [[Quaker Consortium]], allowing Bryn Mawr students to take classes there. Additionally, Bryn Mawr students in the Growth and Structure of Cities department may earn a [[Bachelor of Arts]] at Bryn Mawr and a [[master's degree]] in [[Urban planning|city planning]] at Penn through the 3–2 Program in City and Regional Planning. Students also are allowed to take classes related to their major at the nearby [[Villanova University]] through a specific registration process.

Bryn Mawr is a small, four year, residential baccalaureate college.<ref name="Carnegie">{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&subkey=15920&start=782 |title=Bryn Mawr College&nbsp;– Carnegie Classifications |publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching |access-date=2009-05-30}}</ref> Although the college offers several graduate programs, the majority of enrollments are from students enrolled in the undergraduate arts and sciences program. 

Students at Bryn Mawr are required to complete divisional requirements in the [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]] (including lab skills) and [[humanities]]. In addition, they must complete one year of a [[foreign language]] and fulfill a quantitative skills requirement and an Emily Balch Seminar requirement. The Emily Balch Seminars are similar to courses in freshman composition at other institutions. The seminars stress development of critical thinking skills and are discussion-based, with "intensive reading and writing."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Emily Balch Seminars|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/balch/|work=Bryn Mawr College Undergraduate Courses|publisher=Bryn Mawr College|access-date=2 March 2011}}</ref>

Bryn Mawr students gather quarterly for "Step Sings," or evenings spent outside Taylor Hall, singing hymns, traditional feminist songs and contemporary songs. Step Sings follow each major tradition.<ref name=BMCTrad/>

Two Traditions heads, elected by the student body, are in charge of organizing and running traditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Student Activities: Traditions|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/activities/traditions.shtml|work=brynmawr.edu|access-date=16 March 2011|quote=The Traditions Mistresses, elected officers of the SGA, organize the traditions throughout the academic year. Pamela Gassman and Dijia Chen are the 2014-2015 Traditions Mistresses.}}</ref>

In addition to events, Bryn Mawr's traditions extend to superstitions around the campus, some of which date back to the opening of the college in 1885.<ref>[http://www.brynmawr.edu/activities/traditions.shtml Bryn Mawr College Student Activities]. Brynmawr.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-18.</ref> Many of these superstitions involve not being able to graduate, and can be rectified by leaving an offering at the statue of Athena in the Great Hall.
