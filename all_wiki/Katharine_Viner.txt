Laura Slattery in ''[[The Irish Times]]'', reviewing Viner's career up to March 2015, noted that she "has almost always been the person who does the commissioning, [rather than] provided the byline".<ref>Laura Slattery [http://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/katharine-viner-to-balance-news-and-fun-at-the-guardian-1.2153078#.VRPIW3b0fyo.twitter "Katharine Viner to balance news and 'fun' at the ''Guardian''"], ''The Irish Times'',</ref> Several ''Guardian'' pieces by Viner published during this period are reprinted in an anthology drawn from the ''Guardian'' archive entitled ''Women of the Revolution: Forty Years of Feminism'' (2010), edited by [[Kira Cochrane]].<ref>This includes an article by Viner reflecting on ''Misconceptions'', a book by feminist author [[Naomi Wolf]] concerning Wolf's first experience of childbirth, and other aspects of her career, See Katharine Viner [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/01/society2 "Stitched up"], ''The Guardian'', 1 September 2001, reprinted in Kira Cochrane (ed.)

==Australia and New York==
In January 2013, Viner's relocation to Sydney to supervise a new ''Guardian'' digital edition in Australia was announced;<ref>Mark Sweney [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/15/guardian-launch-digital-australia-edition?CMP=twt_gu "Guardian News & Media to launch digital Australia edition"], guardian.co.uk, 15 January 2013</ref> this venture was launched in May 2013.<ref name="GNMPR">[https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-us-press-office/guardian-senior-editorial-changes "Guardian News & Media announces senior editorial changes"], theguardian.com (press release), 6 March 2014</ref>

Viner delivered the AN Smith Lecture in Journalism at the [[University of Melbourne]] in October 2013.<ref>Katharine Viner [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/09/the-rise-of-the-reader-katharine-viner-an-smith-lecture "The rise of the reader: journalism in the age of the open web"], ''The Guardian'', 9 October 2013.

D. Guttenplan]], London correspondent of the American ''[[The Nation|Nation]]'' magazine, wrote in March 2015 that "there is no one on either side of the [Atlantic] ocean who has thought as deeply as Viner about the relationship between readers, technology and the future of journalism."<ref name="Guttenplan">D.D. Guttenplan [http://www.thenation.com/blog/202273/changing-guardian# "The Changing of 'The Guardian'"], ''The Nation'', 23 March 2015</ref> Guttenplan is not totally convinced by Viner's "eagerness to transcend print" in the move to digital media, but commenting about her 2013 speech in Australia, he writes that "her arguments for the importance of reader engagement, and for sustained, original reporting of information that someone, somewhere, wants to keep secret are compelling and convincing."<ref name="Guttenplan"/>

In the summer of 2014, Viner moved to New York City and became the new head of ''The Guardian''{{'}}s American website in succession to [[Janine Gibson]] while remaining deputy editor of Guardian News & Media.<ref name="GNMPR"/><ref>Ravi Somaiya [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/07/business/media/guardian-to-make-management-changes.html "Guardian to Make Management Changes"], ''New York Times'', 6 March 2014</ref> While based in New York, Viner expanded ''GuardianUS''{{'}}s coverage from a limited range of subjects, into areas like the arts and sport and increased staffing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Perlberg|first=Steven|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/stevenperlberg/how-the-guardian-lost-america|title=How The Guardian Lost America|work=Buzz Feed|date=21 June 2017|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>

==Editor-in-chief of ''The Guardian''==
===Appointment===
In March 2015, Viner won a majority in the ballot of ''Guardian'' and ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' editorial staff as the favoured successor of [[Alan Rusbridger]] as ''The Guardian''{{'}}s editor-in-chief. Viner received 53% of first-choice votes from the 964 staff who participated, and was thus shortlisted for selection.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/05/katharine-viner-wins-staff-ballot-for-guardian-editor "Katharine Viner wins staff ballot for Guardian editor"], theguardian.com, 5 March 2015</ref> Former deputy editor and rival,<ref>Peter Preston [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/22/katharine-viner-new-editor-guardian "Enter Katharine Viner at the Guardian: new editor, old hand"], ''The Observer'', 22 March 2015</ref> Ian Katz (editor of the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' television programme since 2013), was also on the final short list of two.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katharine-viner-appointed-editorinchief-of-the-guardian-10123851.html|title=Katharine Viner appointed editor-in-chief of the Guardian|work=The Independent|date=20 March 2015}}</ref>

Viner was appointed editor-in-chief on 20 March 2015, the first woman to be the editor of ''The Guardian'' in its 194-year history,<ref name="Guardian200315"/> and assumed her new post on 1 June 2015.<ref name="Forbes"/><ref name="NYT200315">Stephen Castle and Ravi Somaiya [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/21/business/media/guardian-names-katharine-viner-as-new-editor.html?_r=0 "Guardian Names Katharine Viner as New Editor"], ''New York Times'', 20 March 2015</ref> She intends to make the "media organisation" a "home for the most ambitious journalism, ideas and events" which is able to reach "out to readers all around the world."<ref name="Guardian200315"/><ref>Henry Mance [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c4b68c40-ce49-11e4-9712-00144feab7de.html#axzz3UwtwCdPT "Katharine Viner appointed Guardian editor"], ''Financial Times'', 20 March 2015</ref>

It has been suggested by author and former ''Guardian'' columnist [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]] that another of Viner's rivals to succeed Rusbridger, [[Janine Gibson]], suffered because of internal disquiet over the internal impact on ''The Guardian'' of the [[Edward Snowden]] revelations which Gibson edited in New York. Wolff said Gibson aligned herself with Snowden, promising more of the same, while Viner "pitched decidedly against Gibson and, in a sense, against Snowden".<ref>Michael Wolff [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2015/03/20/new-editor-for-guardian-newspaper/25094233/ "Snowden effect hits 'Guardian'"], ''USA Today'', 20 March 2015</ref> [[Peter Wilby]], writing in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', preferred a different explanation: "Viner is a more charming, more inclusive and less threatening figure than Janine Gibson, who started as the bookiesâ and Rusbridger's favourite."<ref>Peter Wilby [http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/labour-trap-cameron-s-decade-debacle-democracy-guardian-and-leicester-s-losers "Labour in a trap, Cameronâs decade debacle, democracy at the Guardian and Leicesterâs losers"], ''New Statesman'', 8 April 2015</ref>

===Later developments===
In March 2016, Viner and [[Guardian Media Group|Guardian News and Media]] chief executive David Pemsel announced cost-cutting measures, leading to the projected loss of 250 jobs, to reduce unsustainable losses in order to break even within three years. The following month, ''[[The Times]]'' reported internal tensions within the organisation as Rusbridger prepared to become Chairman of the [[Scott Trust Limited|Scott Trust]], the ultimate overseer to ensure ''The Guardian'' survives "in perpetuity". Rusbridger's expansion of the company's operations was reportedly seen by staff as responsible for the decisions which Viner and Pemsel have made.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rigby|first=Elizabeth|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/guardian-staff-fury-at-rusbridger-return-rg7rmbs5r|title=Guardian staff furious as Rusbridger set to return|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 April 2016|accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref> Viner and David Pemsel successfully opposed Rusbridger becoming Chair of the Scott Trust Ltd and he dropped plans to take up the post.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ponsford|first=Dominic|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/alan-rusbridger-drops-plan-return-scott-trust-chair-face-opposite-guardian-editor-viner-and-chief|title=Alan Rusbridger falls on his sword rather than chair Scott Trust Ltd opposed by editor and chief executive|work=Press Gazette|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=13 May 2016}}</ref>

However, appeals to readers for donations have been successful. "We now get about the same amount of money from membership and paying readers as we do from advertising", Viner told the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in May 2017.<ref name="Bond">{{cite news|last=Bond|first=David|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9044ff9a-358b-11e7-99bd-13beb0903fa3|title=Guardian relies on readersâ support to stave off crisis|work=Financial Times|date=13 May 2017|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> By the time  ''The Guardian'' and sister title ''The Observer'' relaunched as a tabloid in January 2018, part of the cost-cutting exercise,<ref name="Wilby">{{cite news|last=Wilby|first=Peter|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/01/black-and-white-and-not-red-all-over-incredible-shrinking-guardian|title=Black and white and not red all over: the incredible shrinking Guardian|work=The Guardian|date=18 January 2018|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="BBC150118">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42689597|title=The Guardian newspaper adopts tabloid format|work=BBC News|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> revenue from readers exceeded advertising and the group expects to break even in 2018/19, for the first time since the 1980s, rather than continue to sustain heavy losses.<ref name="BBC150118"/><ref name="Econ012018">{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21735046-two-years-ago-newspaper-was-making-existentially-worrying-losses-next-year-it-hopes-break|title=The Guardian heads back into the black|work=The Economist|date=20 January 2018|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> As of 2018 this approach was considered successful, having brought more than 1 million subscriptions or donations, with the paper hoping to break even by April 2019.<ref name=guardian-20181112>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/nov/12/katharine-viner-guardian-million-reader-funding |title=The Guardian's reader funding model is working.

In 2002, Viner criticised the planned [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] and wrote that [[George W.
