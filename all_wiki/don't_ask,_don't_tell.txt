"'''Don't ask, don't tell'''" ('''DADT''') was the official United States policy on [[Sexual orientation and the United States military|military service by gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians]], instituted by the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]]. The policy was issued under [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Directive 1304.26 on December 21, 1993, and was in effect from February 28, 1994, until September 20, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title= Department of Defense Directive 1304.26 |url= http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/html2/d130426x.htm |accessdate= September 11, 2013}}</ref> The policy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing [[closeted]] [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] service members or applicants, while barring [[Coming out|openly gay]], [[lesbian]], or bisexual persons from military service. This relaxation of legal restrictions on service by gays and lesbians in the armed forces was mandated by United States federal law {{USPL|103|160}} ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|654}}), which was signed November 30, 1993.<ref>{{cite web |title= Gays in the Military |url= http://guides.lib.washington.edu/content.php?pid=252734&sid=2701216 |accessdate= September 11, 2013}}</ref> The policy prohibited people who "demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts" from serving in the [[United States Armed Forces|armed forces of the United States]], because their presence "would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability".<ref>{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|10|654|b}}</ref>

The act prohibited any homosexual or bisexual person from disclosing their [[sexual orientation]] or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including [[Same-sex marriage|marriages]] or other familial attributes, while serving in the United States armed forces. The act specified that service members who disclose that they are homosexual or engage in homosexual conduct should be separated (discharged) except when a service member's conduct was "for the purpose of avoiding or terminating military service" or when it "would not be in the best interest of the armed forces".<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|10|654(e)}}</ref> Since DADT ended in 2011, persons who are openly homosexual and bisexual have been able to serve.<ref>{{cite web |title= Army Regulation 40-501, Standards of Medical Fitness, Chapters 2-27n and 3–35 |url= http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r40_501.pdf|accessdate= December 21, 2013}}</ref>

The "don't ask" part of the DADT policy specified that superiors should not initiate investigation of a service member's orientation without witnessing disallowed behaviors, though credible evidence of homosexual behavior could be used to initiate an investigation. Unauthorized investigations and harassment of suspected servicemen and women led to an expansion of the policy to "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue, don't harass".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/d9/D9Legal/docs/05_2010MAYNewsletterDontAskDontTell.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929025359/http://www.uscg.mil/d9/D9Legal/docs/05_2010MAYNewsletterDontAskDontTell.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-09-29 |publisher=United States Coast Guard Ninth District Legal Office |title=''The Legal Brief'' "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue, Don't Harass: Reference (a): Personnel Manual, COMDTINST M1000.6, Ch. 12.E". |date=May 2010 |accessdate=October 23, 2010 }}</ref>

Beginning in the early 2000s, several legal challenges to DADT were filed, and [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010|legislation to repeal DADT]] was enacted in December 2010, specifying that the policy would remain in place until the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] certified that repeal would not harm military readiness, followed by a 60-day waiting period.<ref name="Obama_Signed">{{cite news |author= Sheryl Gay Stolberg |title= Obama Signs Away 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= December 22, 2010 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/us/politics/23military.html |accessdate= December 22, 2010}}</ref> A July 6, 2011, ruling from a federal appeals court barred further enforcement of the U.S. military's ban on openly gay service members.<ref name="Judged_Halts">{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |title= In reversal, federal court orders immediate end to 'don't ask, don't tell' policy |newspaper= The Washington Post |date= July 6, 2011 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-reversal-federal-court-orders-immediate-end-to-dont-ask-dont-tell-policy/2011/07/06/gIQAAdux0H_story.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181206050237/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-reversal-federal-court-orders-immediate-end-to-dont-ask-dont-tell-policy/2011/07/06/gIQAAdux0H_story.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= December 6, 2018 |accessdate= July 6, 2011 }}</ref> President [[Barack Obama]], Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]], and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral [[Michael Mullen|Mike Mullen]] sent that certification to Congress on July 22, 2011, which set the end of DADT to September 20, 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title= Obama certifies end of military's gay ban |agency= [[Reuters]] |publisher= [[NBC News]] |date= July 22, 2011 |url= https://www.nbcnews.com/id/43859711 |accessdate= July 22, 2011}}</ref>

==Background==
{{further|Sexual orientation in the United States military}}
[[File:Dontaskdonttellcredible.jpg|thumb|310px|''Dignity and Respect'', the U.S. Army's 2001 training guide on the homosexual conduct policy, gave official guidelines on what can be considered credible information of someone's homosexuality or bisexuality.]]

Engaging in [[homosexual activity]] has been grounds for discharge from the American military since the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Policies based on sexual orientation appeared as the United States prepared to enter [[World War II]]. When the military added psychiatric screening to its induction process, it included homosexuality as a disqualifying trait, then seen as a form of [[psychopathology]]. When the army issued revised mobilization regulations in 1942, it distinguished "homosexual" recruits from "normal" recruits for the first time.<ref>Bérubé, ''Coming Out Under Fire'', 9–14, 19</ref> Before the buildup to the war, gay service members were court-martialed, imprisoned, and dishonorably discharged; but in wartime, commanding officers found it difficult to convene court-martial boards of commissioned officers and the administrative [[blue discharge]] became the military's standard method for handling gay and lesbian personnel. In 1944, a new policy directive decreed that homosexuals were to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists and discharged under Regulation 615-360, [[Section 8 (military)|section 8]].<ref>Bérubé, ''Coming Out Under Fire'', 142–3</ref>

In 1947, blue discharges were discontinued and two new classifications were created: "general" and "undesirable". Under such a system, a serviceman or woman found to be gay but who had not committed any sexual acts while in service would tend to receive an undesirable discharge. Those found guilty of engaging in sexual conduct were usually dishonorably discharged.<ref>Jones, p. 3</ref> A 1957 U.S. Navy study known as the [[Crittenden Report]] dismissed the charge that homosexuals constitute a security risk, but advocated stringent anti-homosexual policies because "Homosexuality is wrong, it is evil, and it is to be branded as such."<ref>Jennifer Terry, ''An American Obsession: Science, Medicine, and Homosexuality in Modern Society'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999), 347</ref> It remained secret until 1976.<ref>E. Lawrence Gibson, ''Get Off my Ship : Ensign Berg vs. the U.S. Navy'' (NY: Avon, 1978), 256–67</ref> [[Fannie Mae Clackum]] was the first service member to successfully appeal such a discharge, winning eight years of back pay from the [[United States Court of Federal Claims|US Court of Claims]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite book |title= Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America |publisher= Penguin |year= 1991 |place= New York |page= [https://archive.org/details/oddgirlstwilight00fade/page/155 155] |isbn= 978-0-14-017122-8 |author= Lillian Faderman |url= https://archive.org/details/oddgirlstwilight00fade/page/155 |author-link= Lillian Faderman }}</ref>

From the 1950s through the Vietnam War, some notable gay service members avoided discharges despite pre-screening efforts, and when personnel shortages occurred, homosexuals were allowed to serve.<ref>{{cite book |title= Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America |publisher= Penguin |year= 1991 |place= New York |pages= [https://archive.org/details/oddgirlstwilight00fade/page/119 119–138] |isbn= 978-0-14-017122-8 |author= Lillian Faderman |url= https://archive.org/details/oddgirlstwilight00fade/page/119 |author-link= Lillian Faderman }}</ref>

The [[LGBT social movements|gay and lesbian rights movement]] in the 1970s and 1980s raised the issue by publicizing several noteworthy dismissals of gay service members. Sgt. [[Leonard Matlovich]] appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1975.<ref>''TIME'': "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917785,00.html  The Sexes: The Sergeant v. the Air Force]". September 8, 1975. Retrieved July 26, 2011. Other prominent cases included [[Vernon Berg, III|Copy Berg]], [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Stephen Donaldson]].</ref> In 1982 the Department of Defense issued a policy stating that, "Homosexuality is incompatible with military service." It cited the military's need "to maintain discipline, good order, and morale" and "to prevent breaches of security".<ref>Fordham University: [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/gao_report.asp "Homosexuals in the Armed Forces: United States GAO Report"], June 12, 1992. Retrieved February 27, 2012.</ref> In 1988, in response to a campaign against lesbians at the Marines' [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island Depot]], activists launched the Gay and Lesbian Military Freedom Project (MFP) to advocate for an end to the exclusion of gays and lesbians from the armed forces.<ref>Vaid, ''Virtual Equality'', 155-8</ref> In 1989, reports commissioned by the Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), an arm of the Pentagon, were discovered in the process of [[Joseph Steffan]]'s lawsuit fighting his forced resignation from the U.S. Naval Academy.

The MFP began lobbying Congress in 1990, and in 1991 Senator [[Brock Adams]] (D-Washington) and Rep. [[Barbara Boxer]] introduced the Military Freedom Act, legislation to end the ban completely. Adams and Rep. [[Patricia Schroeder|Pat Schroeder]] (D-Colorado) re-introduced it the next year.<ref>McFeeley, "Getting It Straight", 238</ref> In July 1991, Secretary of Defense [[Dick Cheney]], in the context of the outing of his press aide [[Pete Williams (journalist)|Pete Williams]], dismissed the idea that gays posed a security risk as "a bit of an old chestnut" in testimony before the House Budget Committee.<ref>Stephen F.

==Origin==
The policy was introduced as a compromise measure in 1993 by President Bill Clinton who campaigned in 1992 on the promise to allow all citizens to serve in the military regardless of sexual orientation.<ref name="Shankar, Thom">{{cite news |author= Shankar, Thom |title= A New Push to Roll Back 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' |work= The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/us/30military.html |accessdate= December 29, 2012 | date= November 30, 2007}}</ref> Commander [[Craig Quigley]], a Navy spokesman, expressed the opposition of many in the military at the time when he said, "Homosexuals are notoriously promiscuous" and that in shared shower situations, heterosexuals would have an "uncomfortable feeling of someone watching".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/27/us/military-cites-wide-range-of-reasons-for-its-gay-ban.html |title= Military Cites Wide Range of Reasons for Its Gay Ban |accessdate= June 9, 2011 |work=The New York Times |date= January 27, 1993 |first=Eric |last=Schmitt}}</ref>

During the 1993 policy debate, the National Defense Research Institute prepared a study for the Office of the Secretary of Defense published as ''Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military Personnel Policy: Options and Assessment''. It concluded that "circumstances could exist under which the ban on homosexuals could be lifted with little or no adverse consequences for recruitment and retention" if the policy were implemented with care, principally because many factors contribute to individual enlistment and re-enlistment decisions.<ref>{{cite book| author = National Defense Research Institute|author2=Rand Corporation Rand Corporation| title = Sexual orientation and U.S. military personnel policy: options and assessment| url = http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR323/| year = 1993| publisher = Rand| location = Santa Monica, Calif| isbn = 978-0-8330-1441-2| page = 406 }}</ref> On May 5, 1993, [[Gregory M.

He stated, "The research data show that there is nothing about lesbians and gay men that makes them inherently unfit for military service, and there is nothing about heterosexuals that makes them inherently unable to work and live with gay people in close quarters." Herek added, "The assumption that heterosexuals cannot overcome their prejudices toward gay people is a mistaken one."<ref>Gregory M.

In Congress, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Sam Nunn]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] led the contingent that favored maintaining the absolute ban on gays.

Congress rushed to enact the existing gay ban policy into federal law, outflanking Clinton's planned repeal effort. Clinton called for legislation to overturn the ban, but encountered intense opposition from the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], members of Congress, and portions of the public. DADT emerged as a compromise policy.<ref name="Herek">{{cite web| url = Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S. Military: Historical Background | title = Don't Ask, Don't Tell Revisited | accessdate =June 3, 2010 | last = Herek | first = Gregory}}</ref> Congress included text in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (passed in 1993) requiring the military to abide by regulations essentially identical to the 1982 absolute ban policy.<ref name=stanforddont /> The Clinton Administration on December 21, 1993,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/html2/d130426x.htm |title=Defense Directive 1304.26: Qualification Standards for Enlistment, Appointment, and Induction |date=December 21, 1993 |publisher=Department of Defense}}</ref> issued Defense Directive 1304.26, which directed that military applicants were not to be asked about their sexual orientation.<ref name=stanforddont /> This policy is now known as "Don't Ask, Don't Tell".

The full name of the policy at the time was "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue". The "Don't Ask" provision mandated that military or appointed officials will not ask about or require members to reveal their sexual orientation. The "Don't Tell" stated that a member may be discharged for claiming to be a homosexual or bisexual or making a statement indicating a tendency towards or intent to engage in homosexual activities. The "Don’t Pursue" established what was minimally required for an investigation to be initiated. A "Don’t Harass" provision was added to the policy later. It ensured that the military would not allow harassment or violence against service members for any reason.<ref name="Herek"/>

===''McVeigh v. Cohen''===
In January 1998, Senior Chief Petty Officer Timothy R. McVeigh (not to be confused with convicted [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City bomber]], [[Timothy McVeigh|Timothy J. McVeigh]]) won a preliminary injunction from a U.S. district court that prevented his discharge from the U.S. Navy for "homosexual conduct" after 17 years of service. His lawsuit did not challenge the DADT policy, but asked the court to hold the military accountable for adhering to the policy's particulars. The Navy had investigated McVeigh's sexual orientation based on his [[AOL]] email account name and user profile. District Judge [[Stanley Sporkin]] ruled in ''[[McVeigh v. Cohen]]'' that the Navy had violated its own DADT guidelines: "Suggestions of sexual orientation in a private, anonymous email account did not give the Navy a sufficient reason to investigate to determine whether to commence discharge proceedings."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetlibrary.com/pdf/McVeigh-Cohen-DDC.pdf|title=Memorandum Opinion, ''Timothy R.

===''Witt v. Department of the Air Force''===
In April 2006, Margaret Witt, a major in the [[United States Air Force]] who was being investigated for homosexuality, filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]] seeking [[Declaratory relief|declaratory]] and [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] on the grounds that DADT violates substantive [[due process]], the Equal Protection Clause, and procedural due process. In July 2007 the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] ordered her honorable discharge. Dismissed by the district court, the case was heard on appeal, and the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling on May 21, 2008. Its decision in ''[[Witt v. Department of the Air Force]]'' reinstated Witt's substantive-due-process and procedural-due-process claims and affirmed the dismissal of her Equal Protection claim. The Ninth Circuit, analyzing the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), determined that DADT had to be subjected to heightened scrutiny, meaning that there must be an "important" governmental interest at issue, that DADT must "significantly" further the governmental interest, and that there can be no less intrusive way for the government to advance that interest.

The [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] declined to appeal, allowing a May 3, 2009, deadline to pass, leaving ''Witt'' as binding on the entire Ninth Circuit, and returning the case to the District Court.<ref>{{cite news |last= Bravin |first= Jess |author2= Laura Meckler |title= Obama Avoids Test on Gays in Military |work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= May 19, 2009 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124268952606832391 |accessdate= July 24, 2010}}</ref> On September 24, 2010, District Judge [[Ronald B.

District Court neither anticipated questions of
constitutional law nor formulated a rule broader than is required by the facts. The
constitutional issues regarding DADT are well-defined, and the District Court
focused specifically on the relevant inquiry of whether the statute impermissibly
infringed upon substantive due process rights with regard to a protected area of
individual liberty. Engaging in a careful and detailed review of the facts presented
to it at trial, the District Court properly concluded that the Government put forward
no persuasive evidence to demonstrate that the statute is a valid exercise of
congressional authority to legislate in the realm of protected liberty interests. See
Log Cabin, 716 F. Supp. 2d at 923. Hypothetical questions were neither presented
nor answered in reaching this decision.

==Repeal==
The underlying justifications for DADT have been subjected to increasing suspicion and outright rejection by the early 21st century. Mounting evidence obtained from the integration efforts of foreign militaries, surveys of U.S. military personnel, and studies conducted by the DoD&nbsp;gave credence to the view that the presence of open homosexuals within the military would not be detrimental at all to the armed forces. A DoD study conducted at the behest of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in 2010 supports this most.

The DoD working group conducting the study considered the impact that lifting the ban would have on unit cohesion and effectiveness, good order and discipline, and military morale. The study included a survey that revealed significant differences between respondents who believed they had served with homosexual troops and those who did not believe they had. In analyzing such data, the DoD working group concluded that it was actually generalized perceptions of homosexual troops that led to the perceived unrest that would occur without DADT. Ultimately, the study deemed the overall risk to military effectiveness of lifting the ban to be low. Citing the ability of the armed forces to adjust to the previous integration of African-Americans and women, the DoD study asserted that the United States military could adjust as had it before in history without an impending serious effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/law-journals/gjlpp/upload/zs800112000015.pdf|title = The Effects of Repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell: Is the Combat Exclusion the Next Casualty in the March Toward Integration?|last = Crandall|first = Carla}}</ref>

===Implementation of repeal===
The repeal act established a process for ending the DADT policy. The President, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were required to certify in writing that they had reviewed the Pentagon's report on the effects of DADT repeal, that the appropriate regulations had been reviewed and drafted, and that implementation of repeal regulations "is consistent with the standards of military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention of the Armed Forces". Once certification was given, DADT would be lifted after a 60-day waiting period.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.4023: Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]</ref>

==State-based gay and lesbian military veteran laws==

In November 2019, both [[Rhode Island]] and [[New York State]] signed into law and implemented restoring military benefits to gay and lesbian military veterans. An estimated approximately 100,000 individuals were affected by the "don't ask don't tell policy" (since it was repealed in September 2011).<ref>[https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/11/rhode-island-new-york-restore-military-benefits-dishonorably-discharged-lgbtq-veterans/]</ref>
