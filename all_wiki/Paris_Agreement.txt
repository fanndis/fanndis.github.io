The '''Paris Agreement''' ({{lang-fr|l'accord de Paris}})<ref>Also known as Paris climate accord or Paris climate agreement.</ref> is an agreement within the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), dealing with [[Climate change mitigation|greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation]], [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]], and [[finance]], signed in 2016. The agreement's language was negotiated by representatives of 196 state parties at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC]] in [[Le Bourget]], near [[Paris]], [[France]], and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.<ref name="auto">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/12/world/global-climate-change-conference-vote/ |title=Final draft of climate deal formally accepted in Paris |last1=Sutter |first1=John D. |last2=Berlinger |first2=Joshua |date=12 December 2015 |website=CNN |publisher=Cable News Network, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. |access-date=12 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212145741/http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/12/world/global-climate-change-conference-vote/ |archive-date=12 December 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-12/france-presents-ambitious,-balanced-draft-climate-agreement/7023712|work=ABC Australia|title=Paris climate talks: France releases 'ambitious, balanced' draft agreement at COP21|date=12 December 2015}}</ref> As of February 2020, all 196 members of the UNFCCC have signed the agreement and 189 have become [[Party (law)|party]] to it.<ref name=depo/> Of the seven countries which are not party to the law, the only significant emitters are [[Iran]] and [[Greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey|Turkey]].

The Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below {{convert|2|C-change}} above pre-industrial levels; and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to {{convert|1.5|C-change}}, recognizing that this would substantially reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. This should be done by reducing emissions as soon as possible, in order to "achieve a  balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases"  in the second half of the 21st century. It also aims to increase the ability of parties to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, and make "finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development."

Under the Paris Agreement, each country must determine, plan, and regularly report on the contribution that it undertakes to mitigate [[global warming]].<ref name=Article3/> No mechanism forces<ref name=reguly2015>{{cite news |date=14 December 2015 |title=Paris climate accord marks shift toward low-carbon economy |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/optimism-in-paris-as-final-draft-of-global-climate-deal-tabled/article27739122/ |newspaper=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, Canada |access-date=14 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213170301/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/optimism-in-paris-as-final-draft-of-global-climate-deal-tabled/article27739122/ |archive-date=13 December 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> a country to set a specific [[emissions target]] by a specific date,<ref name="BBC-Kinver"/> but each target should go beyond previously set targets.

===Aims===
The aim of the agreement is to decrease global warming described in its Article 2, "enhancing the implementation" of the UNFCCC through:<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url = http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf|work = UNFCCC secretariat|title = Paris Agreement, FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1|accessdate = 12 December 2015|archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6djDMHZAT?url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf|archive-date = 12 December 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

(c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.}}

This strategy involved energy and climate policy including the so-called 20/20/20 targets, namely the reduction of [[Carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)]] emissions by 20%, the increase of [[renewable energy]]'s market share to 20%, and a 20% increase in energy efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recs.org/glossary/european-20-20-20-targets|title=European 20-20-20 Targets|website=RECS International|url-status=dead|access-date=13 April 2019|df=dmy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902111951/http://www.recs.org/glossary/european-20-20-20-targets|archive-date=2 September 2019}}</ref>

Countries furthermore aim to reach "global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible".

The contributions each country should make to achieve the worldwide goal are determined by that country and are called ''nationally determined contributions'' (NDC).<ref name=Article3>Article 3, Paris Agreement (2015)</ref> Article 3 requires them to be "ambitious", "represent a progression over time" and set "with the view to achieving the purpose of this Agreement".

===Effects on global temperature===
The negotiators of the agreement stated that the INDCs presented at the time of the Paris Conference were insufficient, noting "with concern that the estimated aggregate greenhouse gas emission levels in 2025 and 2030 resulting from the intended nationally determined contributions do not fall within least-cost 2&nbsp;°C scenarios but rather lead to a projected level of 55 gigatonnes in 2030", and recognizing furthermore "that much greater emission reduction efforts will be required in order to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2&nbsp;°C by reducing emissions to 40 gigatonnes or to 1.5&nbsp;°C."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/10a01.pdf|work = UNFCCC secretariat|title = Paris Agreement, Decision 1/CP.21, Article 17|accessdate = 6 April 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044717/http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/10a01.pdf|archive-date = 1 April 2016|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref>{{Clarify|reason=number of gigatonnes for 1.5 C needs to be added from the special report|date=October 2020}}

Though not the sustained temperatures over the long term that the Agreement addresses, in the first half of 2016 average temperatures were about {{convert|1.3|C-change}} above the average in 1880, when global record-keeping began.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fountain |first1=Henry |title=Global Temperatures Are on Course for Another Record This Year |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/science/nasa-global-temperatures-2016.html |accessdate=25 July 2016 |work=The New York Times |date=19 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724194029/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/science/nasa-global-temperatures-2016.html |archive-date=24 July 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

When the agreement achieved enough signatures to cross the threshold on 5 October 2016, [[Barack Obama|US President Barack Obama]] claimed that "Even if we meet every target ... we will only get to part of where we need to go."  He also said that "this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change. It will help other nations ratchet down their emissions over time, and set bolder targets as technology advances, all under a strong system of transparency that allows each nation to evaluate the progress of all other nations."<ref name=obamaclimate>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/obama-paris-climate-accord-best-possible-shot-save-planet-n660446|title=A sweeping global climate change agreement was ratified on Wednesday|access-date=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005212924/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/obama-paris-climate-accord-best-possible-shot-save-planet-n660446|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/05/remarks-president-paris-agreement|title=Remarks by the President on the Paris Agreement|publisher=White House|date=5 October 2016|access-date=3 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514025134/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/05/remarks-president-paris-agreement|archive-date=14 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Global stocktake===
[[File:CO2 responsibility 1950-2000.svg|thumb|Map of cumulative per capita anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 emissions by country. Cumulative emissions include land use change, and are measured between the years 1950 and 2000.]]
The global stocktake will kick off with a "facilitative dialogue" in 2018. At this convening, parties will evaluate how their NDCs stack up to the nearer-term goal of peaking global emissions and the long-term goal of achieving net zero emissions by the second half of this century.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/timeline-the-paris-agreements-ratchet-mechanism|title=The Paris Agreement "Ratchet Mechanism"|date=19 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119055158/https://www.carbonbrief.org/timeline-the-paris-agreements-ratchet-mechanism|archive-date=19 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{Update inline|date=October 2020|reason=}}

The implementation of the agreement by all member countries together will be evaluated every 5 years, with the first evaluation in 2023. The outcome is to be used as input for new nationally determined contributions of member states.<ref>article 14 {{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09.pdf |title=Framework Convention on Climate Change |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=12 December 2015 |website=United Nations FCCC Int. |publisher=United Nations |access-date=12 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212201810/http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09.pdf |archive-date=12 December 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The stocktake will not be of contributions/achievements of individual countries but a collective analysis of what has been achieved and what more needs to be done.

The stocktake works as part of the Paris Agreement's effort to create a "ratcheting up" of ambition in emissions cuts. Because analysts agreed in 2014 that the NDCs would not limit rising temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, the global stocktake reconvenes parties to assess how their new NDCs must evolve so that they continually reflect a country's "highest possible ambition".<ref name=":1" />

While ratcheting up the ambition of NDCs is a major aim of the global stocktake, it assesses efforts beyond mitigation. The 5-year reviews will also evaluate adaptation, climate finance provisions, and technology development and transfer.<ref name=":1" />

A preliminary study with implications for the stocktake was published in ''Nature Communications'' in April 2020. Based on a public policy database and a multi-model scenario analysis, the authors showed that implementation of current policies leaves a median emission gap of 22.4 to 28.2 GtCO2eq by 2030 with the optimal pathways to implement the well below 2 °C and 1.5 °C Paris goals. If Nationally Determined Contributions were to be fully implemented, this gap would be reduced by a third. The countries evaluated were found to not achieve their pledged contributions with implemented policies (implementation gap), or to have an ambition gap with optimal pathways towards well below 2 °C. The study showed that all countries would need to accelerate the implementation of policies for renewable technologies, while efficiency improvements are especially important in emerging countries and fossil-fuel-dependent countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Roelfsema|first1=Mark|last2=van Soest|first2=Heleen L.|last3=Harmsen|first3=Mathijs|last4=van Vuuren|first4=Detlef P.|last5=Bertram|first5=Christoph|last6=den Elzen|first6=Michel|last7=Höhne|first7=Niklas|last8=Iacobuta|first8=Gabriela|last9=Krey|first9=Volker|last10=Kriegler|first10=Elmar|last11=Luderer|first11=Gunnar|date=2020-04-29|title=Taking stock of national climate policies to evaluate implementation of the Paris Agreement|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|page=2096|doi=10.1038/s41467-020-15414-6|pmid=32350258|pmc=7190619|bibcode=2020NatCo..11.2096R|issn=2041-1723|doi-access=free}}{{CC-notice|cc=by4}} (The CC BY 4.0 licence means that everyone have the right to reuse the text that is quoted here, or other parts of the original article itself, if they credit the authors.

=== Structure ===
The Paris Agreement has a 'bottom up' structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties, which are 'top down', characterised by standards and targets set internationally, for states to implement.<ref>{{Cite book|title = International Law and the Environment|last = Birnie P, Boyle A and Redgwell C|publisher = OUP|year = 2009|location = Oxford|chapter= Chapter 3}}</ref> Unlike its predecessor, the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus-building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/15030725/ParisClimateAgreement.pdf|title=The Paris Climate Agreement|last=Taraska|first=Gwynne|date=15 December 2015|publisher=Center for American Progress|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118224648/https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/15030725/ParisClimateAgreement.pdf|archive-date=18 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound. Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law. This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an "executive agreement rather than a treaty". Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress for it to take effect.<ref name=":2" />

Another key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scopes.

Article 6 has been flagged as containing some of the key provisions of the Paris Agreement.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=http://www.ieta.org/resources/Resources/Position_Papers/2016/IETA_Article_6_Implementation_Paper_May2016.pdf|title=Article 6 Implementation Paper|date=20 May 2016|website=International Emissions Trading Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017115236/http://ieta.org/resources/Resources/Position_Papers/2016/IETA_Article_6_Implementation_Paper_May2016.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Broadly, it outlines the [[Cooperative Mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement|cooperative approaches]] that parties can take in achieving their nationally determined carbon emissions reductions.

=== Linkage of trading systems and international transfer of mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) ===
[[Cooperative Mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement#Article 6.2: Cooperative Approaches|Paragraphs 6.2]] and 6.3 establish a framework to govern the international transfer of mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). The Agreement recognizes the rights of Parties to use emissions reductions outside of their own jurisdiction toward their NDC, in a system of carbon accounting and trading.<ref name=":5" />

This provision requires the "linkage" of various carbon emissions trading systems—because measured emissions reductions must avoid "double counting", transferred mitigation outcomes must be recorded as a gain of emission units for one party and a reduction of emission units for the other.<ref name=":4" /> Because the NDCs, and domestic carbon trading schemes, are heterogeneous, the ITMOs will provide a format for global linkage under the auspices of the UNFCCC.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Marcu|first=Andrei|year=2016|title=Governance of Carbon Markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/2016-10_paris-agreement-beyond_v4.pdf#page=59|journal=Harvard Project on Climate Agreements|access-date=18 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119062203/http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/2016-10_paris-agreement-beyond_v4.pdf#page=59|archive-date=19 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The provision thus also creates a pressure for countries to adopt emissions management systems—if a country wants to use more cost-effective [[Cooperative Mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement|cooperative approaches]] to achieve their NDCs, they will need to monitor carbon units for their economies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theenergycollective.com/davidhone/2378184/a-vision-for-article-6-of-the-paris-agreement|title=A Vision for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement|last=Hone|first=David|date=16 May 2016|website=The Energy Collective|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120003330/http://www.theenergycollective.com/davidhone/2378184/a-vision-for-article-6-of-the-paris-agreement|archive-date=20 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Sustainable Development Mechanism ===
[[Cooperative Mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement#Article 6.4: Mechanism to promote climate action and support sustainable development|Paragraphs 6.4]]-6.7 establish a mechanism "to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gases and support sustainable development".<ref>United Nations/ Framework Convention on Climate Change (2015) Adoption of the Paris Agreement, 21st Conference of the Parties, Paris: United Nations</ref> Though there is no specific name for the mechanism as yet, many Parties and observers have informally coalesced around the name "Sustainable Development Mechanism" or "SDM".<ref>''"The Carbon Markets of Tomorrow: Taking Shape Today". Ecosystem Market Place. Retrieved 24 October 2016''</ref><ref>Motta, Gabriele (18 May 2016) ''"Market Mechanisms: SDM is the new black!". CliM' Blog. Retrieved 23 October 2016''</ref> The SDM is considered to be the successor to the [[Clean Development Mechanism]], a flexible mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol, by which parties could collaboratively pursue emissions reductions for their [[Intended Nationally Determined Contributions]]. The Sustainable Development Mechanism lays the framework for the future of the Clean Development Mechanism post-Kyoto (in 2020).{{Update inline|date=October 2020|reason=}}

In its basic aim, the SDM will largely resemble the Clean Development Mechanism, with the dual mission to 1. contribute to global GHG emissions reductions and 2. support sustainable development.<ref>Marcu, Andrei. "Carbon Market Provisions in the Paris Agreement (Article 6)." Center for European Policy Studies (2016): n.p. Web. 9 October 2016.</ref> Though the structure and processes governing the SDM are not yet determined, certain similarities and differences from the Clean Development Mechanism can already be seen. Notably, the SDM, unlike the Clean Development Mechanism, will be available to all parties as opposed to only [[Annex 1|Annex-1]] parties, making it much wider in scope.<ref>"Recommendations for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement." Carbon Market Watch. Carbon Market Watch, 19 May 2016. Web. 10 October 2016.</ref>

Since the Kyoto Protocol went into force, the Clean Development Mechanism{{Clarify|reason=not clear whether Kyoto Protocol and CDM are still in force|date=October 2020}} has been criticized for failing to produce either meaningful emissions reductions or sustainable development benefits in most instances.<ref>Böhm, Steffen. ''Upsetting the offset: the political economy of carbon markets''. London: MayFlyBooks, 2009.</ref> It has also suffered from the low price of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs), creating less demand for projects. These criticisms have motivated the recommendations of various stakeholders, who have provided through working groups and reports, new elements they hope to see in SDM that will bolster its success.<ref name=":6" /> The specifics of the governance structure, project proposal modalities, and overall design were expected to come during the 2016 [[Conference of the Parties (Kyoto Protocol)|Conference of the Parties]] in [[Marrakesh]].{{Update inline|date=October 2020|reason=did they?}}

== Adaptation provisions ==
Adaptation issues garnered more focus in the formation of the Paris Agreement. Collective, long-term adaptation goals are included in the Agreement, and countries must report on their adaptation actions, making adaptation a parallel component of the agreement with mitigation.<ref name=":7">{{cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/12/what-does-paris-agreement-mean-climate-resilience-and-adaptation|title=What Does the Paris Agreement Mean for Climate Resilience and Adaptation|last=Mogelgaard|first=Kathleen|date=23 December 2015|website=World Resources Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119060408/http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/12/what-does-paris-agreement-mean-climate-resilience-and-adaptation|archive-date=19 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The adaptation goals focus on enhancing adaptive capacity, increasing resilience, and limiting vulnerability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/12/paris-agreement-turning-point-climate-solution|title=The Paris Agreement: Turning Point for a Climate Solution|last=Morgan|first=Jennifer|date=12 December 2015|website=World Resources Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119055526/http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/12/paris-agreement-turning-point-climate-solution|archive-date=19 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Ensuring finance ===
{{see also|Green Climate Fund}}
At the Paris Conference in 2015 where the Agreement was negotiated, the developed countries reaffirmed the commitment to mobilize $100&nbsp;billion a year in climate finance by 2020, and agreed to continue mobilizing finance at the level of $100&nbsp;billion a year until 2025.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/12/what-does-paris-agreement-do-finance|title=What Does the Paris Agreement do for Finance?|last=Thwaites|first=Joe|date=18 December 2015|publisher=WRI|access-date=10 April 2017|website=WRI|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410215553/http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/12/what-does-paris-agreement-do-finance|archive-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The commitment refers to the pre-existing plan to provide US$100&nbsp;billion a year in aid to developing countries for actions on climate change adaptation and mitigation.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35084374|title=COP21 climate change summit reaches deal in Paris|date=13 December 2015|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News Services|access-date=14 December 2015|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213160112/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35084374|archive-date=13 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Though both mitigation and adaptation require increased climate financing, adaptation has typically received lower levels of support and has mobilised less action from the private sector.<ref name=":7" /> A 2014 report by the OECD found that just 16 percent of global finance was directed toward climate adaptation in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/env/cc/Climate-Finance-in-2013-14-and-the-USD-billion-goal.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530220000/http://www.oecd.org/env/cc/Climate-Finance-in-2013-14-and-the-USD-billion-goal.pdf |archive-date=30 May 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Paris Agreement called for a balance of climate finance between adaptation and mitigation, and specifically underscored the need to increase adaptation support for parties most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. The agreement also reminds parties of the importance of public grants, because adaptation measures receive less investment from the public sector.<ref name=":7" /> [[John Kerry]], as Secretary of State, announced that the U.S. would double its grant-based adaptation finance by 2020.<ref name=":2" />

Some specific outcomes of the elevated attention to adaptation financing in Paris include the G7 countries' announcement to provide US$420&nbsp;million for [[Climate risk insurance]], and the launching of a Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/themes/climate-change/Documents/climate-finance-roadmap-to-us100-billion.pdf|title=Roadmap to US$100 Billion|publisher=OECD|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120116/http://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/themes/climate-change/Documents/climate-finance-roadmap-to-us100-billion.pdf|archive-date=19 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2016, the Obama administration gave a $500&nbsp;million grant to the "[[Green Climate Fund]]" as "the first chunk of a $3{{nbsp}}billion commitment made at the Paris climate talks."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/obama-administration-pays-out-500m-to-climate-change-project|title=Obama administration pays out $500m to climate change project &#124; Environment|date=8 March 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Suzanne Goldenberg|accessdate=23 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422221247/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/obama-administration-pays-out-500m-to-climate-change-project|archive-date=22 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-un-usa-idUSKCN0WA090|title=United States delivers first payment to global climate fund|last=Volcovici|first=Valerie|date=7 March 2016|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=23 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413135916/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-un-usa-idUSKCN0WA090|archive-date=13 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=UNFrameworkConvention>{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09.pdf |title=Framework Convention on Climate Change |date=12 December 2015 |website=United Nations FCCC Int. |publisher=United Nations |access-date=12 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212201810/http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09.pdf |archive-date=12 December 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> So far,{{When|date=October 2020}} the Green Climate Fund has received over $10&nbsp;billion in pledges.

=== Loss and damage ===
A new issue that emerged<ref>{{Cite web|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries - Rwanda|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/vwTreatiesByCountrySelected.xsp?xp_countrySelected=RW&nv=4|website=ihl-databases.icrc.org|access-date=2020-05-30}}</ref> as a focal point in the Paris negotiations rose from the fact that many of the worst effects of climate change will be too severe or come too quickly to be avoided by adaptation measures. The Paris Agreement specifically acknowledges the need to address loss and damage of this kind, and aims to find appropriate responses.<ref name=WorldResourcesInstitute>{{cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/12/when-adaptation-not-enough-paris-agreement-recognizes-%E2%80%9Closs-and-damage%E2%80%9D|title=When Adaptation is Not Enough|last=Mogelgaard|first=Kathleen|date=24 December 2015|website=World Resources Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008083845/http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/12/when-adaptation-not-enough-paris-agreement-recognizes-%E2%80%9Closs-and-damage%E2%80%9D|archive-date=8 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It specifies that loss and damage can take various forms—both as immediate impacts from extreme weather events, and slow onset impacts, such as the loss of land to sea-level rise for low-lying islands.<ref name=":2"/>

The push to address loss and damage as a distinct issue in the Paris Agreement came from the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries, whose economies and livelihoods are most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change.<ref name=":2"/> Developed countries, however, worried that classifying the issue as one separate and beyond adaptation measures would create yet another climate finance provision, or might imply legal liability for catastrophic climate events.

In the end, all parties acknowledged the need for "averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage" but notably, any mention of compensation or liability is excluded.<ref name=":0"/> The agreement also adopts the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, an institution that will attempt to address questions about how to classify, address, and share responsibility for loss.<ref name=WorldResourcesInstitute/>

== Enhanced transparency framework ==
While each Party's NDC is not legally binding, the Parties are legally bound to have their progress tracked by technical expert review to assess achievement toward the NDC, and to determine ways to strengthen ambition.<ref name=":9">{{cite web|url=http://www.climatefocus.com/sites/default/files/20151228%20COP%2021%20briefing%20FIN.pdf|title=The Paris Agreement Summary|date=28 December 2015|website=Climate Focus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509090559/http://www.climatefocus.com/sites/default/files/20151228%20COP%2021%20briefing%20FIN.pdf|archive-date=9 May 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Article 13 of the Paris Agreement articulates an "enhanced transparency framework for action and support" that establishes harmonized monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) requirements. Thus, both developed and developing nations must report every two years on their mitigation efforts, and all parties will be subject to both technical and peer review.<ref name=":9" />

=== Flexibility mechanisms ===
While the enhanced transparency framework is universal, along with the global stocktaking to occur every 5 years, the framework is meant to provide "built-in flexibility" to distinguish between developed and developing countries' capacities. In conjunction with this, the Paris Agreement has provisions for an enhanced framework for capacity building.<ref name=":10">{{cite web|url=https://www.sei-international.org/mediamanager/documents/Publications/Climate/SEI-PB-2016-Transparency-under-Paris-Agreement.pdf|title=Putting the 'enhanced transparency framework' into action: Priorities for a key pillar of the Paris Agreement|website=Stockholm Environment Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119062033/https://www.sei-international.org/mediamanager/documents/Publications/Climate/SEI-PB-2016-Transparency-under-Paris-Agreement.pdf|archive-date=19 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The agreement recognizes the varying circumstances of some countries, and specifically notes that the technical expert review for each country consider that country's specific capacity for reporting.<ref name=":10" /> The agreement also develops a Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency to assist developing countries in building the necessary institutions and processes for complying with the transparency framework.<ref name=":10" />

There are several ways that flexibility mechanisms can be incorporated into the enhanced transparency framework. The scope, level of detail, or frequency of reporting may all be adjusted and tiered based on a country's capacity. The requirement for in-country technical reviews could be lifted for some less developed or small island developing countries. Ways to assess capacity include financial and human resources in a country necessary for NDC review.<ref name=":10" />

===Negotiations===
Within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, legal instruments may be adopted to reach the goals of the convention. For the period from 2008 to 2012, greenhouse gas reduction measures were agreed in the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The scope of the protocol was extended until 2020 with the Doha Amendment to that protocol in 2012.<ref>{{cite news  |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20653018  |title= UN climate talks extend Kyoto Protocol, promise compensation  |work= BBC News  |date= 8 December 2012  |access-date= 22 June 2018  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180716140524/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20653018  |archive-date= 16 July 2018  |url-status= live  |df= dmy-all  }}</ref>

===European Union and its member states===
Both the EU and its member states are individually responsible for ratifying the Paris Agreement. A strong preference was reported that the EU and its 28 member states deposit their instruments of ratification at the same time to ensure that neither the EU nor its member states engage themselves to fulfilling obligations that strictly belong to the other,<ref name=eurat>{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-when-will-european-union-ratify-paris-agreement|title=Explainer: When will the European Union ratify the Paris Agreement?|last=Yeo|first=Sophie|date=23 June 2016|access-date=3 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905103935/http://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-when-will-european-union-ratify-paris-agreement|archive-date=5 September 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and there were fears that disagreement over each individual member state's share of the EU-wide reduction target, as well as Britain's [[Brexit|vote to leave the EU]] might delay the Paris pact.<ref name = "Nature">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/paris-climate-deal-to-take-effect-as-eu-ratifies-accord-1.20735|title=Paris climate deal to take effect as EU ratifies accord|journal=Nature|date=4 October 2016|access-date=5 October 2016|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20735|last1=Schiermeier|first1=Quirin|s2cid=158043198|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005125351/http://www.nature.com/news/paris-climate-deal-to-take-effect-as-eu-ratifies-accord-1.20735|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the European Parliament approved ratification of the Paris Agreement on 4 October 2016,<ref name="europeancommission"/> and the EU deposited its instruments of ratification on 5 October 2016, along with several individual EU member states.<ref name="Nature" />

==Implementation==
The process of translating the Paris Agreement into national agendas and implementation has started. One example is the commitment of the least developed countries (LDCs). The LDC Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative for Sustainable Development, known as LDC REEEI, is set to bring sustainable, clean energy to millions of energy-starved people in LDCs, facilitating improved energy access, the creation of jobs and contributing to the achievement of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].<ref name=D+C>{{cite news|title=Addressing our climate reality|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/least-developed-countries-demand-robust-rulebook-implement-paris-agreement-and-call-adequate|author=Gebru Jember Endalew|work=D+C, development and cooperation|date=27 August 2017|accessdate=5 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005212746/https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/least-developed-countries-demand-robust-rulebook-implement-paris-agreement-and-call-adequate|archive-date=5 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Per analysis from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]] a carbon "budget" based upon total carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere (versus the rate of annual emission) to limit global warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C was estimated to be 2.25&nbsp;trillion tonnes of overall emitted carbon dioxide from the period since 1870. This number is a notable increase from the number estimated by the original Paris Climate accord estimates (of around 2&nbsp;trillion tonnes total) total carbon emission limit to meet the 1.5&nbsp;°C global warming target, a target that would be met in the year 2020 at 2017 rates of emission.{{Clarify|reason=confusing sentence|date=October 2020}} Additionally, the annual emission of carbon is estimated in 2017 to be at 40&nbsp;billion tonnes emitted per year. The revised IPCC budget for this was based upon [[Coupled model intercomparison project|CMIP5]] climate model. Estimate models using different base-years also provide other slightly adjusted estimates of a carbon "budget".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21729423-new-estimates-permissible-carbon-dioxide-emissions-notwithstanding-there|title=There is still no room for complacency in matters climatic|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010044123/https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21729423-new-estimates-permissible-carbon-dioxide-emissions-notwithstanding-there|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In July 2020 the [[World Meteorological Organisation]] (WMO) announced that it assessed a 20% chance of [[global warming]] compared to pre-industrial levels exceeding 1.5 °C in at least one year between 2020 and 2024, with 1.5 °C being a key threshold under the Paris Agreement.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Woodyatt |first1=Amy |title=Global temperatures could exceed crucial 1.5 C target in the next five years |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/world/global-temperatures-wmo-climate-intl-scli/index.html |accessdate=15 August 2020 |work=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=New climate predictions assess global temperatures in coming five years |url=https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/new-climate-predictions-assess-global-temperatures-coming-five-years |website=World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=15 August 2020 |language=en |date=8 July 2020}}</ref>

=== {{anchor|US withdrawal}} Withdrawal from Agreement ===
{{see | United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement}}

Article 28 of the agreement enables parties to withdraw from the agreement after sending a withdrawal notification to the depositary. Notice can be given no earlier than three years after the agreement goes into force for the country. Withdrawal is effective one year after the depositary is notified. Alternatively, the Agreement stipulates that withdrawal from the UNFCCC, under which the Paris Agreement was adopted, would also withdraw the state from the Paris Agreement. The conditions for withdrawal from the UNFCCC are the same as for the Paris Agreement. The agreement does not specify provisions for non-compliance.

How well each individual country is on track to achieving its Paris agreement commitments can be continuously followed on-line (through the Climate Action Tracker<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/|title=Countries &#124; Climate Action Tracker|website=climateactiontracker.org}}</ref> and the [[Climate Clock]]).

A 2018 published study points at a threshold at which temperatures could rise to 4 or 5 degrees (ambiguous phrase, continuity would be “4-5 °C”) compared to the pre-industrial levels, through [[climate feedback|self-reinforcing feedbacks]] in the climate system, suggesting this threshold is below the 2-degree temperature target, agreed upon by the Paris climate deal. Study author Katherine Richardson stresses, "We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2&nbsp;°C warmer than the pre-industrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will 'want' to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions. This implies not only reducing emissions but much more."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state|work=The Guardian|year=2018|title=Domino-effect of climate events could push Earth into a 'hothouse' state|access-date=7 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807143122/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state|archive-date=7 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

At the same time, another 2018 published study notes that even at a 1.5&nbsp;°C level of warming, important increases in the occurrence of high river flows would be expected in India, South and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Paltan|first1=Homero|last2=Allen|first2=Myles|last3=Haustein|first3=Karsten|last4=Fuldauer|first4=Lena|last5=Dadson|first5=Simon|date=2018|title=Global implications of 1.5&nbsp;°C and 2&nbsp;°C warmer worlds on extreme river flows|journal=Environmental Research Letters|language=en|volume=13|issue=9|pages=094003|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/aad985|bibcode=2018ERL....13i4003P|issn=1748-9326|doi-access=free}}</ref> Yet, the same study points out that with 2&nbsp;°C of warming various areas in South America, central Africa, western Europe, and the Mississippi area in the United States would see more high flows; thus increasing flood risks.

===Lack of binding enforcement mechanism===
Although the agreement was lauded by many, including French President François Hollande and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon,<ref name="auto2"/> criticism has also surfaced.

Institutional asset owners associations and think-tanks have also observed that the stated objectives of the Paris Agreement are implicitly "predicated upon an assumption – that member states of the United Nations, including high polluters such as China, the US, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Indonesia and Mexico, which generate more than half the world's greenhouse gas emissions, will somehow drive down their carbon pollution voluntarily and assiduously without any binding enforcement mechanism to measure and control {{CO2}} emissions at any level from factory to state, and without any specific penalty gradation or fiscal pressure (for example a [[carbon tax]]) to discourage bad behaviour."<ref name="auto3">{{cite news|author1=M.

=== UNEP===
According to the United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]), if only the current climate commitments of the Paris Agreement are relied upon, temperatures will likely have risen by 3.2&nbsp;°C by the end of the 21st century. To limit global temperature rise to 1.5&nbsp;°C, annual emissions must be below 25 gigatons (Gt) by 2030. With current Nov 2019 commitments, emissions will be 56 Gt CO2e by 2030, twice the environmental target. To limit global temperature rise to 1.5&nbsp;°C, the global annual emission reduction needed is 7.6% emissions reduction every year between 2020 and 2030. The top four emitters (China, USA, EU27 and India) contributed to over 55% of the total emissions over the last decade,{{Clarify|reason=should this say "over the 2010s"?|date=October 2020}} excluding emissions from land-use change such as deforestation. China's emissions grew 1.6% in 2018 to reach a high of 13.7 Gt of CO2 equivalent. The US emits 13% of global emissions and emissions rose 2.5% in 2018. The EU emits 8.5% of global emissions has declined 1% per year across the last decade. Emissions declined 1.3% in 2018. India's 7% of global emissions grew 5.5% in 2018 but its emissions per capita is one of the lowest within the G20.<ref>[https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/ Emissions Gap Report 2019 Global progress report on climate action] UNEP Nov 2019</ref>
