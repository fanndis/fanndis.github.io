In the early 1600s, the immediate Baltimore vicinity was sparsely populated, if at all, by Native Americans. The Baltimore County area northward was used as hunting grounds by the [[Susquehannock]] living in the lower [[Susquehanna River]] valley.

The Town of Baltimore, Jonestown, and Fells Point were [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as the ''City of Baltimore'' in 1796–1797.

The [[Battle of Baltimore]] against the British in 1814 inspired the U.S. national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]," and the construction of the [[Battle Monument]] which became the city's official emblem. A distinctive local culture started to take shape, and a unique skyline peppered with churches and monuments developed. Baltimore acquired its moniker "The Monumental City" after an 1827 visit to Baltimore by President [[John Quincy Adams]].

Baltimore pioneered the use of [[gas lighting]] in 1816, and its population grew rapidly in the following decades, with concomitant development of culture and infrastructure. The construction of the federally funded [[National Road]] (which later became part of [[U.S. Route 40]]) and the private [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B. & O.) made Baltimore a major shipping and [[manufacturing]] center by linking the city with major markets in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. By 1820 its population had reached 60,000, and its economy had shifted from its base in tobacco plantations to [[sawmilling]], [[shipbuilding]], and [[textile]] production. These industries benefited from war but successfully shifted into [[infrastructure]] development during peacetime.<ref>Townsend (2000), pp. 62–68.</ref>

Baltimore lawyer Milton Dashiell advocated for an ordinance to bar African-Americans from moving into the [[Eutaw Place]] neighborhood in northwest Baltimore. He proposed to recognize majority white residential blocks and majority black residential blocks and to prevent people from moving into housing on such blocks where they would be a minority.

====Development and promotion====
By the beginning of the 1970s, Baltimore's downtown area, known as the Inner Harbor, had been neglected and was occupied by a collection of abandoned warehouses.

==Geography==
[[File:Baltimore by Sentinel-2, 2020-07-29.jpg|left|thumb|Satellite image of Baltimore]]
Baltimore is in north-central Maryland on the [[Patapsco River]] close to where it empties into the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The city is also located on the [[fall line]] between the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] Plateau and the [[Atlantic coastal plain]], which divides Baltimore into "lower city" and "upper city". The city's elevation ranges from sea level at the harbor to {{convert|480|ft|m}} in the northwest corner near [[Pimlico, Baltimore|Pimlico]].<ref name="elevation" />

According to the 2010 Census, the city has a total area of {{convert|92.1|sqmi|sp=us}}, of which {{convert|80.9|sqmi|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|11.1|sqmi|abbr=on}} is water.<ref name="gazetteer">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_24.txt|title=(no title provided)|website=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|publisher=United States Census Bureau|at=Counties > Maryland<!--present in archive.org-->|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> The total area is 12.1 percent water.

Baltimore is almost surrounded by Baltimore County, but is [[Independent city (United States)|politically independent]] of it. It is bordered by Anne Arundel County to the south.

===Cityscape===
{{wide image|Baltimore-sunset-pano.jpg|1100px|3=<div align=center>Panoramic view of Baltimore along the Inner and Outer Harbor at dusk, as seen from the [[HarborView Condominium]].</div>}}

====Architecture====
Baltimore exhibits examples from each period of architecture over more than two centuries, and work from architects such as [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Benjamin Latrobe]], [[George A. Frederick]], [[John Russell Pope]], [[Mies van der Rohe]] and [[I. M. Pei]].

The city is rich in architecturally significant buildings in a variety of styles. The [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary|Baltimore Basilica]] (1806–1821) is a neoclassical design by Benjamin Latrobe, and also the oldest Catholic cathedral in the United States. In 1813 Robert Cary Long, Sr., built for [[Rembrandt Peale]] the first substantial structure in the United States designed expressly as a museum. Restored is now the Municipal Museum of Baltimore, or popularly the [[Peale Museum]].

The [[McKim's School|McKim Free School]] was founded and endowed by John McKim. However, the building was erected by his son [[Isaac McKim|Isaac]] in 1822 after a design by William Howard and William Small. It reflects the popular interest in [[ancient Greece|Greece]] when the nation was securing its independence and a scholarly interest in recently published drawings of Athenian antiquities.

The [[Phoenix Shot Tower]] (1828), at {{convert|234.25|ft|m}} tall, was the tallest building in the United States until the time of the Civil War, and is one of few remaining structures of its kind.<ref>Dorsey & Dilts (1997), pp. 182–183. "Once there were three such towers in Baltimore; now there are only a few left in the world."</ref> It was constructed without the use of exterior scaffolding. The Sun Iron Building, designed by R.C. Hatfield in 1851, was the city's first iron-front building and was a model for a whole generation of downtown buildings. [[Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church]], built in 1870 in memory of financier [[George Brown (financier)|George Brown]], has [[stained glass]] windows by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and has been called "one of the most significant buildings in this city, a treasure of art and architecture" by ''Baltimore Magazine''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.browndowntown.org/files/april_balt_magazine.pdf|title=Window to the Future|last=Evitts|first=Elizabeth|date=April 2003|magazine=[[Baltimore (magazine)|Baltimore Magazine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911075155/http://www.browndowntown.org/files/april_balt_magazine.pdf|archive-date=September 11, 2011|access-date=May 6, 2009|via=[[Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church]]}}</ref><ref name=Sun2003>{{Cite news| last=Bishop| first=Tricia| title=Illuminated by a jewel| work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]| date=April 7, 2003| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/321974201.html?dids=321974201:321974201&FMT=ABS&FMTS |access-date=May 6, 2009}}</ref>

The 1845 [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]-style [[Lloyd Street Synagogue]] is one of the [[oldest synagogues in the United States]]. The [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], designed by [[John Shaw Billings|Lt. Col. John S. Billings]] in 1876, was a considerable achievement for its day in functional arrangement and fireproofing.

I.M. Pei's [[Baltimore World Trade Center|World Trade Center]] (1977) is the tallest equilateral pentagonal building in the world at {{convert|405|ft|m}} tall.

The [[Inner Harbor East|Harbor East]] area has seen the addition of two new towers which have completed construction: a 24-floor tower that is the new world headquarters of [[Legg Mason]], and a 21-floor [[Four Seasons Hotel]] complex.

The streets of Baltimore are organized in a [[Grid plan|grid pattern]], lined with tens of thousands of brick and [[formstone]]-faced [[Terraced house|rowhouses]]. In ''The Baltimore Rowhouse'', Mary Ellen Hayward and [[Charles Belfoure]] considered the rowhouse as the architectural form defining Baltimore as "perhaps no other American city."<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pGARnkq3eUC&q=baltimore+rowhouse| title=The Baltimore Rowhouse| author=Mary Ellen Hayward and Charles Belfoure| publisher=Princeton Architectural Press| year=1999| isbn=978-1-56898-283-0| page=back cover| access-date=March 21, 2011}}</ref> In the mid-1790s, developers began building entire neighborhoods of the British-style rowhouses, which became the dominant house type of the city early in the 19th century.<ref>Hayward and Belfoure, pp 17–18, 22.</ref>

Formstone facings, now a common feature on Baltimore rowhouses, were an addition patented in 1937 by Albert Knight. [[John Waters (director born 1946)|John Waters]] characterized formstone as "the polyester of brick" in a 30-minute documentary film, ''Little Castles: A Formstone Phenomenon''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://welcometobaltimorehon.com/the-story-behind-formstone| title=The Story of Formstone| work=Welcome to Baltimore, Hon!| author=Paul K.

[[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] is a Major League Baseball park, opened in 1992, which was built as a [[retro style]] [[baseball park]]. Camden Yards, along with the National Aquarium, have helped revive the Inner Harbor from what once was an [[industrial district]] full of dilapidated warehouses into a bustling commercial district full of bars, restaurants and retail establishments. Today, the Inner Harbor has some of the most desirable real estate in the Mid-Atlantic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/03/11/waterfront-mansion-overlooking-inner-harbor-priced-at-8-5m/ |title=Waterfront Mansion Overlooking Inner Harbor Priced At $8.5M " CBS Baltimore |publisher=Baltimore.cbslocal.com |date=March 11, 2013 |access-date=July 8, 2013}}</ref>

After an international competition, the [[University of Baltimore School of Law]] awarded the German firm [[Behnisch Architekten]] 1st prize for its design, which was selected for the school's new home. After the building's opening in 2013, the design won additional honors including an ENR National "Best of the Best" Award.<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Baltimore Law School Wins ENR National "Best of the Best" Award for Design and Construction|url=http://www.muellerassoc.com/university-baltimore-law-school-wins-enr-national-%E2%80%9Cbest-best%E2%80%9D-award-design-and-construction|publisher=Mueller Associates|date=January 2, 2014|access-date=May 13, 2017}}</ref>

Baltimore's newly rehabilitated [[Everyman Theatre, Baltimore|Everyman Theatre]] was honored by the Baltimore Heritage at the 2013 Preservation Awards Celebration in 2013. Everyman Theatre will receive an Adaptive Reuse and Compatible Design Award as part of Baltimore Heritage's 2013 historic preservation awards ceremony.

Crime in Baltimore, generally concentrated in areas high in poverty, has been far above the national average for many years. Overall reported crime has dropped by 60% from the mid 1990s to the mid 2010s, but homicide rates remain high and exceed the national average. The worst years for crime in Baltimore overall were from 1993 to 1996; with 96,243 crimes reported in 1995. Baltimore's 344 homicides in 2015 represented the highest homicide rate in the city's recorded history—52.5 per 100,000 people, surpassing the record set in 1993—and the second-highest for U.S. cities behind [[St. Louis]] and ahead of [[Detroit]]. To put that in perspective, New York City, a city with a 2015 population of 8,491,079, recorded a total of 339 homicides in 2015. Baltimore had a 2015 population of 621,849; which means that in 2015 Baltimore had a homicide rate 14 times higher than New York City's. Of Baltimore's 344 homicides in 2015, 321 (93.3%) of the victims were African-American.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} [[Chicago]], which saw 762 homicides in 2016 compared to Baltimore's 318, still had a homicide rate (27.2) that was half of Baltimore's because Chicago has a population four times greater than Baltimore's.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} As of 2018, the murder rate in Baltimore was higher than that of [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], or [[Honduras]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/08/01/fact-check-baltimore-murder-rate-higher-than-el-salvador-guatemala-honduras/ |publisher=WJZ-TV |title=Fact Check: Is Baltimore's Murder Rate Higher Than Central American Countries'? |date=August 1, 2019 |first=Logan |last=Reigstad |access-date=August 3, 2019 }}</ref> Drug use and deaths by drug use (particularly drugs used intravenously, such as heroin) are a related problem which has crippled Baltimore for decades.

Crime in Baltimore reached another peak in 2015 when the year's tally of 344 homicides was second only to the record 353 in 1993, when Baltimore had about 100,000 more residents. The killings in 2015 were on pace with recent years in the early months of 2015 but skyrocketed after the [[Baltimore Uprising|unrest and rioting of late April]]. In five of the next eight months, killings topped 30–40 per month. Nearly 90 percent of 2015's homicides resulted from shootings, renewing calls for new gun laws. In 2016, according to annual crime statistics released by the Baltimore Police Department, there were 318 murders in the city.<ref>Rector, Kevin (January 3, 2017).

Can anyone save the city from itself?"] ''The Guardian''.</ref> [[David Simon]], himself a former police reporter for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', ascribed the most recent surge in murders to the high-profile decision by Baltimore state's attorney, [[Marilyn Mosby]], to charge six city police officers following the [[death of Freddie Gray]] after he fell into a coma while in police custody in April 2015. "What Mosby basically did was send a message to the Baltimore police department: 'I'm going to put you in jail for making a bad arrest.' So officers figured it out: 'I can go to jail for making the wrong arrest, so I'm not getting out of my car to clear a corner,' and that's exactly what happened post-Freddie Gray." In Baltimore, "arrest numbers have plummeted from more than 40,000 in 2014, the year before Gray's death and the subsequent charges against the officers, to about 18,000 [as of November 2017].

===Port===
The center of international commerce for the region is the [[Baltimore World Trade Center|World Trade Center Baltimore]]. It houses the Maryland Port Administration and U.S. headquarters for major shipping lines. Baltimore is ranked 9th for total dollar value of cargo and 13th for cargo tonnage for all U.S. ports. In 2014, total cargo moving through the port totaled 29.5&nbsp;million tons, down from 30.3&nbsp;million tons in 2013. The value of cargo traveling through the port in 2014 came to $52.5&nbsp;billion, down from $52.6&nbsp;billion in 2013. The [[Port of Baltimore]] generates $3&nbsp;billion in annual wages and salary, as well as supporting 14,630 direct jobs and 108,000 jobs connected to port work. In 2014, the port also generated more than $300&nbsp;million in taxes. It serves over 50 ocean carriers making nearly 1,800 annual visits. Among all U.S. ports, Baltimore is first in handling automobiles, light trucks, farm and construction machinery; and imported forest products, aluminum, and sugar. The port is second in coal exports. The Port of Baltimore's cruise industry, which offers year-round trips on several lines supports over 500 jobs and brings in over $90&nbsp;million to Maryland's economy annually. Growth at the port continues with the Maryland Port Administration plans to turn the southern tip of the former steel mill into a marine terminal, primarily for car and truck shipments, but also for anticipated new business coming to Baltimore after the completion of the [[Panama Canal expansion project]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/port.html#cruise |title=Port of Baltimore, Maryland |publisher=Msa.maryland.gov |access-date=October 13, 2015}}</ref>

{{Main|Baltimore dialect}}
Baltimore city, along with its surrounding regions, is home to a unique local dialect known as the [[Baltimore dialect]].

The original [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|19th century Baltimore Orioles]] were one of the most successful early franchises, featuring numerous hall of famers during its years from 1882 to 1899.
As one of the eight inaugural American League franchises, the Baltimore Orioles played in the AL during the 1901 and 1902 seasons. The team moved to New York City before the 1903 season and was renamed the New York Highlanders, which later became the [[New York Yankees]].
Ruth played for the [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|minor league Baltimore Orioles]] team, which was active from 1903 to 1914. After playing one season in 1915 as the Richmond Climbers, the team returned the following year to Baltimore, where it played as the Orioles until 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Baltimore_Orioles_(IL)|title=Baltimore Orioles (minors)|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|access-date=April 5, 2011}}</ref>

The team currently known as the [[Baltimore Orioles]] has represented Major League Baseball locally since 1954 when the St. Louis Browns moved to the city of Baltimore.

Prior to an NFL team moving to Baltimore, there had been several attempts at a professional football team prior to the 1950s. Most were minor league or [[semi-professional]] teams. The first major league to base a team in Baltimore was the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), which had a team named the [[Baltimore Colts (1947–50)|Baltimore Colts]]. The AAFC Colts played for three seasons in the AAFC (1947, 1948, and 1949), and when the AAFC folded following the 1949 season, moved to the NFL for a single year (1950) before going bankrupt. Three years later, the NFL's [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] would itself fold. Its assets and player contracts purchased by an ownership team headed by Baltimore businessman [[Carroll Rosenbloom]], who moved the team to Baltimore, establishing a new team also named the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Colts were one of the NFLs more successful franchises, led by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]] who set a then-record of 47 consecutive games with a touchdown pass. The Colts advanced to the [[NFL Championship]] twice (1958 & 1959) and [[Super Bowl]] twice (1969 & 1971), winning all except [[Super Bowl III]] in 1969. After the 1983 season, the team [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|left Baltimore for Indianapolis in 1984]], where they became the [[Indianapolis Colts]].

The NFL returned to Baltimore when the former [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|Cleveland Browns]] moved to Baltimore to become the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in 1996.

Baltimore also hosted a [[Canadian Football League]] franchise, the [[Baltimore Stallions]] for the [[1994 CFL season|1994]] and [[1995 CFL season|1995]] seasons. Following the 1995 season, and ultimate end to the [[Canadian Football League in the United States]] experiment, the team was sold and relocated to [[Montreal]].

Here, a train stops at [[Convention Center station (Light RailLink)|Convention Center station]], just west of the [[Baltimore Convention Center]] on [[Pratt Street]].]]
The city of Baltimore has a higher-than-average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 30.7 percent of Baltimore households lacked a car, which decreased slightly to 28.9 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Baltimore averaged 1.65 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|access-date=May 3, 2018}}</ref>

===Roads and highways===
Baltimore's highway growth has done much to influence the development of the city and its suburbs. The first [[limited-access highway]] serving Baltimore was the [[Baltimore–Washington Parkway]], which opened in stages between 1950 and 1954. Maintenance of it is split: the half closest to Baltimore is maintained by the state of Maryland, and the half closest to Washington by the [[National Park Service]]. Trucks are only permitted to use the northern part of the parkway. Trucks (tractor-trailers) continued to use [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|U.S. Route 1]] (US 1) until [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate 95]] (I-95) between Baltimore and Washington opened in 1971.

The Interstate highways serving Baltimore are [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]], I-83 (the Jones Falls Expressway), I-95, [[Interstate 395 (Maryland)|I-395]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]] (the Baltimore Beltway), [[Interstate 795 (Maryland)|I-795]] (the Northwest Expressway), [[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]] (the Harbor Tunnel Thruway), and [[Interstate 97|I-97]]. The city's mainline Interstate highways—I-95, I-83, and I-70—do not directly connect to each other, and in the case of I-70 end at a park and ride lot just inside the city limits, because of [[highway revolts|freeway revolts]] in Baltimore. These revolts were led primarily by [[Barbara Mikulski]], a former [[United States senator]] for Maryland, which resulted in the abandonment of the original plan. There are two tunnels traversing Baltimore Harbor within the city limits: the four-bore [[Fort McHenry Tunnel]] (opened in 1985 and serving I-95) and the two-bore [[Baltimore Harbor Tunnel|Harbor Tunnel]] (opened in 1957 and serving I-895). The Baltimore Beltway crosses south of Baltimore Harbor over the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Baltimore)|Francis Scott Key Bridge]].

[[File:2019-07-15 13 34 07 View south along Interstate 395 (Cal Ripken Way) at its junction with Interstate 95 from the overpass for the ramp from Interstate 395 southbound to Interstate 95 northbound in Baltimore City, Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-95 from the ramp from I-395 to I-95 northbound in Baltimore]]
The first interstate highway built in Baltimore was I-83, called the Jones Falls Expressway (first portion built in the early 1960s). Running from the downtown toward the northwest (NNW), it was built through a natural corridor, which meant that no residents or housing were directly affected. A planned section from what is now its southern terminus to I-95 was abandoned. Its route through parkland received criticism.

Planning for the Baltimore Beltway antedates the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. The first portion completed was a small strip connecting the two sections of I-83, the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway and the Jones Falls Expressway.

The only [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highways]] in the city are US 1, which bypasses downtown, and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US 40]], which crosses downtown from east to west. Both run along major surface streets; however, US 40 utilizes a small section of a freeway cancelled in the 1970s in the west side of the city originally intended for [[Interstate 170 (Maryland)|Interstate 170]]. State routes in the city also travel along surface streets, with the exception of [[Maryland Route 295]], which carries the Baltimore–Washington Parkway.

The Baltimore City Department of Transportation (BCDOT) is responsible for several functions of the road transportation system in Baltimore, including repairing roads, sidewalks, and alleys; road signs; street lights; and managing the flow of transportation systems.<ref name=bcdot>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation.aspx| title=Home| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation| access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref> In addition, the agency is in charge of vehicle towing and [[traffic camera]]s.<ref name=bcdot2>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/VehicleTowing.aspx| title=Vehicle Towing| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation| access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref><ref name=bcdot3>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/TrafficCameras.aspx| title=Traffic Cameras| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation|access-date=January 21, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110127061625/http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/TrafficCameras.aspx| archive-date= January 27, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> BCDOT maintains all streets within the city of Baltimore. These include all streets that are marked as state and U.S. highways as well as the portions of I-83 and I-70 within the city limits. The only highways within the city that are not maintained by BCDOT are I-95, I-395, I-695, and I-895; those four highways are maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority.<ref name="Baltimore City HLR 2005">{{cite web| title=Highway Location Reference: Baltimore City |publisher=Maryland State Highway Administration |year=2005 |url=http://www.marylandroads.com/Location/2005_BALTIMORECITY.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714044312/http://www.marylandroads.com/Location/2005_BALTIMORECITY.pdf |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |access-date=July 8, 2013}}</ref>

====Intercity rail====
[[File:Baltimore Pennsylvania Station corrected.jpg|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore)|Baltimore Pennsylvania Station]]]]
Baltimore is a top destination for [[Amtrak]] along the [[Northeast Corridor]]. Baltimore's [[Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]] is one of the busiest in the country. In FY 2014, Penn Station was ranked the [[List of busiest Amtrak stations|seventh-busiest]] rail station in the [[United States]] by number of passengers served each year.<ref name="Fact Sheet">{{cite web |title=Amtrak Fact Sheet, FY2014, Maryland |publisher=[[Amtrak]] Government Affairs |date=November 2014 |url=http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/MARYLAND14.pdf |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref> The building sits on a raised "island" of sorts between two open trenches, one for the Jones Falls Expressway and the other for the tracks of the Northeast Corridor (NEC). The NEC approaches from the south through the two-track, {{Convert|7660|ft}} [[Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel]], which opened in 1873 and whose {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on|-1}} limit, sharp curves, and steep grades make it one of the NEC's worst bottlenecks. The NEC's northern approach is the 1873 [[Union Tunnel (Baltimore)|Union Tunnel]], which has one [[single track (rail)|single-track]] bore and one [[double track|double-track]] bore.

Just outside the city, [[BWI Rail Station|Baltimore/Washington International (BWI) Thurgood Marshall Airport Rail Station]] is another stop. Amtrak's ''[[Acela Express]]'', ''[[Palmetto (train)|Palmetto]]'', ''[[Carolinian (train)|Carolinian]]'', ''[[Silver Star (Amtrak train)|Silver Star]]'', ''[[Silver Meteor]]'', ''[[Vermonter (train)|Vermonter]]'', ''[[Crescent (train)|Crescent]]'', and ''[[Northeast Regional]]'' trains are the scheduled passenger train services that stop in the city. Additionally, [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail service connects the city's two main intercity rail stations, Camden Station and Penn Station, with Washington, D.C.'s [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] as well as stops in between. The MARC consists of 3 lines; the Brunswick, Camden and Penn. On December 7, 2013 the Penn Line began weekend service.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-04/local/41740904_1_weekend-service-penn-line-rafi-guroian | work=The Washington Post | first1=John | last1=Wagner | first2=Dana | last2=Hedgpeth | title=Maryland Politics | date=September 5, 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118204549/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-04/local/41740904_1_weekend-service-penn-line-rafi-guroian | archive-date=November 18, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Airports===
[[File:Kbwi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The interior of [[Baltimore–Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]], Baltimore's major commercial airport]]
Baltimore is served by two airports, both operated by the Maryland Aviation Administration, which is part of the [[Maryland Department of Transportation]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marylandaviation.com/ | title=Maryland Aviation Administration | publisher=Maryland Aviation Administration | access-date=April 5, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405093832/http://www.marylandaviation.com/| archive-date= April 5, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Baltimore–Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]], generally known as "BWI," lies about {{convert|10|mi|0}} to the south of Baltimore in neighboring Anne Arundel County. The airport is named after [[Thurgood Marshall]], a Baltimore native who was the first African American to serve on the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In terms of passenger traffic, BWI is the 22nd busiest airport in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bwiairport.com/en/about-bwi/factsfigures/genpassengerstats |title=General Passenger Statistics |publisher=Baltimore/Washington International Airport |access-date=October 26, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106203412/http://www.bwiairport.com/en/about-bwi/factsfigures/genpassengerstats |archive-date=November 6, 2016 }}</ref> As of calendar year 2014, BWI is the largest, by passenger count, of three major airports serving the [[Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area]]. It is accessible by I-95 and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway via [[Interstate 195 (Maryland)|Interstate 195]], the [[Baltimore Light Rail]], and Amtrak and MARC Train at [[BWI Rail Station]].

Baltimore is also served by [[Martin State Airport]], a [[general aviation]] facility, to the northeast in Baltimore County. Martin State Airport is linked to [[downtown Baltimore]] by [[Maryland Route 150]] (Eastern Avenue) and by MARC Train at [[Martin State Airport (MARC station)|its own station]].

===Pedestrians and bicycles===
Baltimore has a comprehensive system of bicycle routes in the city. These routes are not numbered, but are typically denoted with green signs displaying a silhouette of a bicycle upon an outline of the city's border, and denote the distance to destinations, much like bicycle routes in the rest of the state. The roads carrying bicycle routes are also labelled with either bike lanes, sharrows, or Share the Road signs. Many of these routes pass through the downtown area. The network of bicycle lanes in the city continues to expand, with over {{convert|140|mi}} added between 2006 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-01-22/entertainment/bs-b-0122-baltimore-bikes-20140121_1_downtown-baltimore-penny-troutner-nathan-krasnopoler|title=Wheels of Change: Baltimore's bike crusade|work=The Baltimore Sun|author=Andrew Zaleski|date=January 22, 2014|access-date=September 2, 2014}}</ref> Alongside bike lanes, Baltimore has also built [[bike boulevard]]s, starting with Guilford Avenue in 2012.

Baltimore currently has three major trail systems within the city. The [[Gwynns Falls Trail]] runs from the Inner Harbor to the I-70 Park and Ride, passing through [[Gwynns Falls Park]] and possessing numerous branches. There are also many pedestrian hiking trails traversing the park. The [[Jones Falls Trail]] currently runs from the Inner Harbor to the Cylburn Arboretum; however, it is currently undergoing expansion. Long-term plans call for it to extend to the [[Mount Washington (Baltimore Light Rail station)|Mount Washington Light Rail Stop]], and possibly as far north as the Falls Road stop to connect to the Robert E. Lee boardwalk north of the city. It will also incorporate a spur alongside Western Run. The two aforementioned trails carry sections of the [[East Coast Greenway]] through the city. There is also the Herring Run Trail, which runs from [[Maryland Route 147|Harford Road]] east to its end beyond Sinclair Lane, utilizing Herring Run Park; long-term plans also call for its extension to Morgan State University and north to points beyond. Other major bicycle projects include a protected cycle track installed on both Maryland Avenue and Mount Royal Avenue, expected to become the backbone of a downtown bicycle network. Installation for the cycletracks is expected in 2014 and 2016, respectively.

In addition to the bicycle trails and cycletracks, Baltimore has the Stony Run Trail, a walking path that will eventually connect from the Jones Falls north to Northern Parkway, utilizing much of the old Ma and Pa Railroad corridor inside the city. In 2011, the city undertook a campaign to reconstruct many sidewalk ramps in the city, coinciding with mass resurfacing of the city's streets. A 2011 study by [[Walk Score]] ranked Baltimore the 14th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/|title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |access-date=August 28, 2011}}</ref>

===Port of Baltimore===

The port was founded in 1706, preceding the founding of Baltimore. The Maryland colonial legislature made the area near [[Locust Point, Baltimore|Locust Point]] as the [[port of entry]] for the [[tobacco]] trade with England. Fells Point, the deepest point in the natural harbor, soon became the colony's main ship building center, later on becoming leader in the construction of [[Baltimore Clipper|clipper ships]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.baltimoremd.com/monuments/sea01.html| title=Fells Point: The Port of Early Baltimore| author=Christopher T. George| work=Baltimore A Link to the City| access-date=March 16, 2011}}</ref>

After Baltimore's founding, mills were built behind the wharves. The [[California Gold Rush]] led to many orders for fast vessels; many overland pioneers also relied upon canned goods from Baltimore. After the Civil War, a coffee ship was designed here for trade with [[Brazil]]. At the end of the nineteenth century, European ship lines had terminals for immigrants. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad made the port a major [[transshipment]] point.<ref name=Stover>{{cite book | last = Stover | first = John F. | title = History of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad | publisher=Purdue University Press | year = 1987 | location = West Lafayette, IN | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IEPCqQErPHAC&q=History+of+the+Baltimore+and+Ohio+Railroad&pg=PP1 | isbn = 978-0-911198-81-2}}</ref>{{rp|17,75}} Currently the port has major [[roll-on/roll-off]] facilities, as well as bulk facilities, especially steel handling.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mpa.maryland.gov/content/types-of-cargo.php | title=Types of Cargo| publisher=Maryland Port Administration | access-date=January 19, 2011}}</ref>

[[Water taxi]]s also operate in the Inner Harbor. Governor Ehrlich participated in naming the port after [[Helen Delich Bentley]] during the 300th anniversary of the port.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.teslasociety.com/bentley.htm | title=Governor Ehrlich Names Port of Baltimore After Helen Delich Bentley | publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York | access-date=January 5, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100104174645/http://teslasociety.com/bentley.htm| archive-date= January 4, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In 2007, [[Duke Realty]] Corporation began a new development near the Port of Baltimore, named the Chesapeake Commerce Center. This new industrial park is located on the site of a former General Motors plant. The total project comprises {{convert|184|acre|km2}} in eastern Baltimore City, and the site will yield {{convert|2800000|sqft|m2}} of warehouse/distribution and office space. Chesapeake Commerce Center has direct access to two major Interstate highways ([[I-95]] and [[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]]) and is located adjacent to two of the major Port of Baltimore terminals. The Port of Baltimore is one of two seaports on the U.S. East Coast with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} dredge to accommodate the largest shipping vessels.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mpasafepassage.org/safe.html| title=Safe Passage| publisher=Maryland Port Administration| access-date=January 19, 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320042637/http://www.mpasafepassage.org/safe.html| archive-date=March 20, 2011| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Along with cargo terminals, the port also has a passenger cruise terminal, which offers year-round trips on several lines, including Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas and Carnival's Pride. Overall five cruise lines have operated out of the port to the Bahamas and the Caribbean, while some ships traveled to New England and Canada. The terminal has become an embarkation point where passengers have the opportunity to park and board next to the ship visible from Interstate 95.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/02/AR2009100202643.html |title=Baltimore Port to Open Year-Round for Cruise Traffic |work=Washingtonpost.com |date=October 4, 2009 |access-date=October 13, 2015}}</ref> Passengers from Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey make up a third of the volume, with travelers from Maryland, Virginia, the District and even Ohio and the Carolinas making up the rest.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/02/AR2009100202643_2.html |title=Baltimore Port to Open Year-Round for Cruise Traffic |work=Washingtonpost.com |date= October 4, 2009|access-date=October 13, 2015}}</ref>

==Environment==
Baltimore's Inner Harbor, known for its skyline waterscape and its tourist-friendly areas, was horribly polluted. The waterway was often filled with garbage after heavy rainstorms, failing its 2014 water quality report card. The Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore took steps to remediate the waterways, in hopes that the harbor would be fishable and swimmable once again.
