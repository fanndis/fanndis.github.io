==History==
{{Main|History of Christianity in Britain}}

===Roman Britons and early Christianity===
[[File:Saint Alban (cropped).jpg|200px|thumb|[[St. Alban]] is regarded as the [[protomartyr]] of the Roman Britons]]
Much of [[Great Britain]] was incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] in 43 AD, after [[Claudius]] led the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], conquering lands inhabited by [[Celtic Britons]]. The indigenous religion of the Britons under their priests the [[Druids]] was suppressed; most notably [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]] launched [[Roman conquest of Anglesey|an attack]] on [[Anglesey|Ynys Môn]] in 60 AD and destroyed the shrine and [[sacred groves]] there. In the years following this, Roman influence saw the importation of several religious [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] into Britain, including [[Roman mythology]], [[Mithraism]] and the [[imperial cult]]. One of these sects, then disapproved by the Roman authorities, was the [[Levant]]ine-originated religion of [[Christianity]]. While it is unclear exactly how it arrived, the earliest British figures considered [[saint]]s by the Christians are [[St. Alban]] followed by Ss [[Julius and Aaron]], all in the 3rd century.<ref name="celt">{{cite news|url=https://www.uwlax.edu/urc/jur-online/PDF/2008/grunke.pdf|publisher=Kimberly Rachel Grunke|title=The Effect of Christianity upon the British Celts|date=6 November 2016|access-date=21 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514221040/https://www.uwlax.edu/urc/jur-online/PDF/2008/grunke.pdf|archive-date=14 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Eventually, the position of the Roman authorities on Christianity moved from hostility to toleration with the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 AD, and then enforcement as [[state religion]] following the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380 AD, becoming a key component of [[Romano-British culture]] and society. Records note that [[Romano-British]] bishops, such as [[Restitutus]], attended the [[Council of Arles (314)|Council of Arles in 314]], which confirmed the theological findings of an earlier convocation held in Rome (the [[Council of Rome]]) in 313. The [[Roman departure from Britain]] in the following century and the subsequent [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Germanic invasions]] sharply decreased contact between Britain and Continental Europe. Christianity, however, continued to flourish in the [[Britons (historical)|Brittonic]] areas of Great Britain. During this period certain practices and traditions took hold in Britain and in Ireland that are collectively known as [[Celtic Christianity]]. Distinct features of Celtic Christianity include a unique monastic [[tonsure]] and calculations for the date of [[Easter]].<ref>[[Charles Plummer]], "Excursus on the Paschal Controversy and Tonsure", in his edition ''Venerablilis Baedae, Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum'', 1892 (Oxford: University Press, 1975), pp. 348–354.</ref> Regardless of these differences, historians do not consider this Celtic or British Christianity a distinct church separate from general Western European Christianity.<ref>Kathleen Hughes, "The Celtic Church: Is This a Valid Concept?", ''O'Donnell lectures in Celtic Studies'', University of Oxford 1975 (published in ''Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies'', 1 [1981], pp. 1–20).</ref><ref>Wendy Davies, "The Myth of the Celtic Church", in ''The Early Church in Wales and the West'', Oxbow Monograph, no. 16, edited by Nancy Edwards and Alan Lane, 12–21. Oxford: Oxbow, 1992.</ref>

===Conversion of the Anglo-Saxons===
[[File:Statue_d%27Alfred_le_Grand_à_Winchester.jpg|thumb|King Alfred the Great]]
In 597, [[Pope Gregory I]] sent [[Augustine of Canterbury]] and 40 missionaries from Rome to evangelise the [[Anglo-Saxons]], a process completed by the 7th century. The [[Gregorian mission]], as it is known, is of particular interest in the Catholic Church as it was the first official Papal mission to found a church. With the help of Christians already residing in [[Kent]], Augustine established an archbishopric in [[Canterbury]], the old capital of Kent, and, having received the [[pallium]] earlier (linking his new diocese to Rome), became the first in the series of Catholic [[archbishops of Canterbury]], four of whom ([[Laurence of Canterbury|Laurence]], [[Mellitus]], [[Justus]] and [[Honorius of Canterbury|Honorius]]) were part of the original band of [[Benedictine]] missionaries. (The last Catholic archbishop of Canterbury was [[Reginald Pole]], who died in 1558.) During this time of mission, Rome pursued greater unity with the local church in Britain, particularly on the question of dating Easter. [[Columbanus]], his fellow countryman and churchman, had asked for a papal judgement on the Easter question as did abbots and bishops of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Home}}</ref> Later, in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', [[Bede]] explained the reasons for the discrepancy: "He [Columba] left successors distinguished for great charity, Divine love, and strict attention to the rules of discipline following indeed uncertain cycles in the computation of the great festival of Easter, because far away as they were out of the world, no one had supplied them with the synodal decrees relating to the Paschal observance."<ref>H.E., III, iv</ref> A series of [[synod]]s were held to resolve the matter, culminating with the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 644. The missionaries also introduced the [[Rule of Benedict]], the continental rule, to Anglo-Saxon monasteries in England.<ref>Peter Ackroyd ''Albion'' (New York: Anchor Books, 2002), 33.</ref> [[Wilfrid]], a Benedictine consecrated archbishop of York (in 664), was particularly skilled in promoting the Benedictine Rule.<ref>http://www.newadvent.org: St Wilfrid.</ref> Over time, the Benedictine continental rule became grafted upon the monasteries and parishes of England, drawing them closer to the Continent and Rome. As a result, the pope was often called upon to intervene in quarrels, affirm monarchs, and decide jurisdictions. In 787, for example, [[Pope Adrian I]] elevated [[Lichfield]] to an archdiocese and appointed [[Hygeberht]] its first archbishop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advent.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 January 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419011623/http://www.advent.org/ |archivedate=19 April 2014  }}: Hygeberht, Adrian I</ref> Later, in 808, [[Pope Leo III]] helped restore King [[Eardwulf]] of [[Northumbria]] to his throne; and in 859, [[Pope Leo IV]] confirmed and anointed [[Alfred the Great]] king, according to ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. Individual Benedictines seemed to play an important role throughout this period. For example, before Benedictine monk [[St. Dunstan]] was consecrated archbishop of Canterbury in 960, [[Pope John XII]] had him appointed legate, commissioning him (along with [[Ethelwold]] and Oswald) to restore discipline in the existing monasteries of England, many of which were destroyed by Danish invaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advent.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 January 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419011623/http://www.advent.org/ |archivedate=19 April 2014  }}: St Dunstan</ref>

===Norman Conquest of England and Wales===
[[File:Our Lady of Walsingham detail I.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Our Lady of Walsingham]]]]
Control of the English Church passed from the Anglo-Saxons to the [[Normans]] following the [[Norman conquest of England]]. The two clerics most prominently associated with this process were the continental-born [[Lanfranc]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], both Benedictines. Anselm later became a [[Doctor of the Church]]. A century later, [[Pope Innocent III]] had to confirm the primacy of Canterbury over four [[Wales|Welsh]] churches for many reasons, but primarily to sustain the importance of the Gregorian foundation of Augustine's mission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advent.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 January 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419011623/http://www.advent.org/ |archivedate=19 April 2014  }}: Lanfranc, Anselm, Innocent III, Hubert Walter, Canterbury.</ref><ref>Note Bede in his ''Hist. Eccl.'', I, xxxiii: "When Augustine, the first archbishop of Canterbury, assumed the throne in that royal city, he recovered therein, by the king's assistance, a church which, as he was told, had been constructed by the original labor of Roman believers. This church he consecrated in the name of the Saviour, Our God and Lord Jesus Christ, and there he established an habitation for himself and his successors."</ref>

During mediaeval times, England and Wales were part of western Christendom. During this period, monasteries and convents, such as those at [[Shaftesbury Abbey|Shaftesbury]] and [[Shrewsbury Abbey|Shrewsbury]], were prominent features of society providing lodging, hospitals and education.<ref>Charterhouse in London: monastery, mansion, hospital, school / by Gerald S. Davis – Davies, Gerald S. (Gerald Stanley), 1845–1927 26 27 31</ref> Likewise, schools like [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]] were important. Members of [[religious orders]], notably the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Franciscans]], settled in both schools and maintained houses for students. Clerics like Archbishop [[Walter de Merton]] founded [[Merton College]] at Oxford and three different popes – [[Gregory IX]], [[Pope Nicholas IV|Nicholas IV]], and [[John XXII]] – gave Cambridge the legal protection and status to compete with other European [[medieval universities]].

Pilgrimage was a prominent feature of mediaeval Catholicism, and England and Wales were amply provided with many popular sites of pilgrimage. The village of [[Walsingham]] in Norfolk became an important shrine after a noblewoman named [[Richeldis de Faverches]] experienced a reputed vision of the Virgin Mary in 1061 asking her to build a replica of the [[Holy House]] at [[Nazareth]]. Some of the other holiest shrines were those at [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] in Wales which commemorated St [[Winefride]] and at Westminster Abbey to [[Edward the Confessor]]. In 1170, [[Thomas Becket]], Archbishop of Canterbury, was murdered in his cathedral by followers of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] and was quickly canonised as a martyr for the faith. This resulted in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] attracting international pilgrimage and inspired the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].
[[File:Pope_Hadrian_IV.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Hadrian IV]]. The only Englishman to be a Pope ]]
An Englishman, Nicholas Breakspear, became [[Pope Adrian IV]], reigning from 1154 to 1159. Fifty-six years later, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Stephen Langton]], the first of [[English cardinals]] and later Archbishop of Canterbury (1208–28), became a pivotal figure in the dispute between [[John of England|King John]] and Pope Innocent III. This critical situation led to the signing and later promulgation of the [[Magna Charta]] in 1215, which, among other things, insisted that the English church shall be free of ecclesiastical appointments fixed by the king.

===Tudor period and Catholic resistance===
[[File:Banner of the Holy Wounds (Pilgrimage of Grace).svg|thumb|A banner showing the [[Holy Wounds]] of [[Jesus Christ]] which was carried by partisans during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].]]
The dynamics of the pre-Reformation bond between the Catholic Church in England and the Apostolic See remained in effect for nearly a thousand years. That is, there was no doctrinal difference between the faith of the English and the rest of Catholic Christendom, especially after calculating the date of Easter at the [[Council of Whitby]] in 667 and formalizing other customs according to the See of Rome. The designation "English Church" (''Ecclesia Anglicana'' in Latin) was made, but always in the sense of the term as indicating that it was part of one Catholic Church in communion with the Holy See and localised in England. Other regions of the church were localised in Scotland (''Ecclesia Scotticana''), France (''Ecclesia Gallicana''), Spain (''Ecclesia Hispanica''), etc. These regional cognomens or designations were commonly used in Rome by officials to identify a locality of the universal church but never to imply any breach with the Holy See.<ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' on the breach with Rome under Henry VIII.</ref>

When [[King Henry VIII]] "suddenly became alerted to the supposedly ancient truth" that he was truly the "Supreme Head of the Church within his dominions", he backed a series of legislative acts through the English Parliament between 1533-1536 that initiated an attack on papal authority and English Catholics. "The centerpiece of the new legislation was an Act of Supremacy of 1534." <ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''The Reformation'' (New York: Viking, 2004}, 193-194.</ref> In some cases those adhering to [[Catholicism]] faced [[capital punishment]].<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Malley|first=John W.|title=Early modern Catholicism: Essays in Honour of John W. O'Malley, S.J.|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2001|page=149|isbn=978-0-8020-8417-0|display-authors=etal}}</ref> 

In 1534, during the reign of Henry VIII, the English church became independent of the Holy See for a period as a "local church" with Henry declaring himself its Supreme Head.<ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''The Reformation'' (New York: Viking, 2003), 193,4. MacCulloch: "This program became a series of legislative acts steered through the English Parliament between 1533 and 1536 by a new chief minister, the obscurely born Thomas Cromwell."</ref> This breach was in response to the Pope's refusal to annul Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]]. Although Henry did not himself accept [[Protestant]] innovations in doctrine or liturgy, he nevertheless extended toleration, and even promotion, to clergy with Protestant sympathies in return for support for his break with Rome. On the other hand, failure to accept this break, particularly by prominent persons in church and state, was regarded by Henry as treason, resulting in the execution of [[Thomas More]], former Lord Chancellor, and [[John Fisher]], [[Bishop of Rochester]], among others. The [[See of Rome Act 1536]] legitimised the separation from Rome, while the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] of 1536 and [[Bigod's Rebellion]] of 1537, risings in the North against the religious changes, were bloodily repressed.

All through 1536–41, Henry VIII engaged in a large-scale [[dissolution of the Monasteries]] in order to gain control of most of the wealth of the church and much of the richest land. He disbanded [[Monastery|monasteries]], [[Priory|priories]], [[convent]]s and friaries in England, Wales and Ireland, appropriated their income, disposed of their assets, and provided pensions for the former residents. He did not turn these properties over to his local Church of England. Instead they were sold, mostly to pay for the wars. The historian G. W. Bernard argues that the dissolution of the monasteries in the late 1530s was one of the most revolutionary events in English history. There were nearly 900 religious houses in England, around 260 for monks, 300 for regular canons, 142 nunneries and 183 friaries; some 12,000 people in total, 4,000 monks, 3,000 canons, 3,000 friars and 2,000 nuns. One adult man in fifty was in religious orders.<ref>G. W. Bernard, "The Dissolution of the Monasteries," ''History'' (2011) 96#324 p 390</ref> In the Catholic narrative, Henry's action was sacrilegious, a national violation of things consecrated to God, and evil. Even today, Henry's act is still considered controversial. Anglicans like Giles Fraser have noted that the property "was stolen" from the Roman Catholic Church and that "this theft of land is the really dirty stuff – the original sin of the Church of England."<ref>Giles Fraser, "Where did the Church's land go?" UnHerd, 5 December 2019, 2. https://unherd.com/2019/05/what-has-the-church-done-with-its-land/</ref> Nevertheless, Henry maintained a strong preference for traditional Catholic practices and, during his reign, Protestant reformers were unable to make many changes to the practices of his local church, the Church of England. Indeed, this part of Henry's reign saw the trial for heresy of Protestants as well as Catholics who resisted his policies.

The 1547 to 1553 reign of the boy [[King Edward VI]] saw the Church of England become more influenced by Protestantism in its doctrine and worship. In 1550 [[Jan Łaski|John Laski]], a [[Poland|Polish]] ex-catholic cleric and nephew of the Polish primate, whose Catholic career came "to an abrupt end in 1540 when he married", only to later become a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]],<ref>MacCulloch, ''Reformation'', 247 </ref> arrived in London and became superintendent of the [[Dutch Church, Austin Friars|Strangers' Church of London]]. He, among other Protestants, became an associate of [[Thomas Cranmer]] and of [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]]. He had some influence on ecclesiastical affairs during the reign of Edward VI.<ref>Michael S. Springer, ''Restoring Christ's Church: John a Lasco and the Forma ac ratio'' Aldershot, Ashgate, (St Andrews Studies in Reformation History) 2007</ref> For instance, the [[Tridentine Mass]] was replaced by the (English) ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', representational art and statues in church buildings destroyed, and Catholic practices which had survived during Henry's reign, such as public prayers to the Virgin Mary, e.g. the ''[[Salve Regina]]'', ended. In 1549 the Western Rising in Cornwall and Devon broke out to protest against the abolition of the Mass – the rebels called the 1549 Holy Communion Service, "commonly called the Mass", a Christian game. The rebellion -- resistance to Protestantism -- was put down ruthlessly.

==== Reign of Mary I ====
[[File:Mary I by Master John.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] by Master John]]
Under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], in 1553, the fractured and schismatic English Church was linked again to continental Catholicism and the See of Rome through the doctrinal and liturgical initiatives of [[Reginald Pole]] and other Catholic reformers.<ref>Alexandra Walsham, "unnecessary rupture", ''the Tablet'', 18 March 2017 (in a review of Eamon Duffy's ''Reformation Divided: Catholics, Protestants and the Conversion of England'' [Bloomsbury]).</ref><ref>Loades, pp. 207–208; Waller, p. 65; Whitelock, p. 198.</ref> Mary was determined to return the whole of England to the Catholic faith. This aim was not necessarily at odds with the feeling of a large section of the populace; Edward's Protestant reformation had not been well received everywhere, and there was ambiguity in the responses of the parishes.<ref> In Ludlow in Shropshire the parishioners complied with the orders to remove the rood and other images in 1547, and in the same year spent money on making up the canopy to be carried over the Blessed Sacrament on the feast of Corpus Christi. ([[Eamon Duffy]], ''[[The Stripping of the Altars]]'', p. 481, [[Yale University Press]], 1992).</ref> Mary had some powerful families behind her. The Jerningham family together with other East Anglian Catholic families such as the Bedingfelds, Waldegraves, Rochesters together with the Huddlestons of [[Sawston Hall]] were "the key to Queen Mary's successful accession to the throne. Without them she would never have made it."<ref>Keith Miles, "Portrait of Mary Tudor", ''[[The Tablet]]'' 12 September 2009, 20</ref> However, Mary's execution of 300 Protestants by burning them at the stake proved counterproductive as this measure was extremely unpopular with the populace. For example, instead of executing [[Archbishop Cranmer]] for treason for supporting [[Lady Jane Grey|Queen Jane]], she had him tried for heresy and burned at the stake.<ref>Diarmard MacCulloch ''Thomas Cranmer: A Life'' (London: [[Yale University Press]], 1996), 538–41 {{ISBN|0-300-06688-0}}</ref><ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''The Reformation, A History'' (New York: [[Viking Press]], 2003), 272–7.</ref> ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]'', which glorified the Protestants killed at the time and vilified Catholics, ensured her a place in popular memory as ''Bloody Mary''. <ref>"Mary's Protestant Martyrs and Elizabeth's Catholic Traitors in the Age of Catholic Emancipation", John E. Drabble / ''Church History'', Vol. 51, No. 2 (June 1982), pp. 172–185.</ref> For centuries after, the idea of another reconciliation with Rome was linked in many English people's minds with a renewal of Mary's fiery stakes. Ultimately, her harshness was a success but at the cost of alienating a fairly large section of English society which had been moving away from some traditional Catholic devotional practices. These English were neither Calvinist nor Lutheran, but certainly leaning towards [[Protestant reformation]] (and by the late sixteenth century, were certainly Protestant).<ref>Alister McGrath, "Focus on Anglican Identity," www.gazette.ireland.anglican.org/10/22/2007.</ref>

When Mary died and [[Elizabeth I]] became queen in 1558, the religious situation in England was confused. Throughout the alternating religious landscape of the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, and Mary I, a significant proportion of the population (especially in the rural and outlying areas of the country) were likely to have continued to hold Catholic views, or were conservative. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was a Protestant and the "very rituals with which the parish had celebrated her accession would be swept away".<ref>Christopher Howse, "Reformation Myths Exploded," ''The Tablet'', 26 May 2012, 19</ref> Thus Elizabeth's first act was to reverse her sister's re-establishment of Catholicism by [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity]]. [[Act of Supremacy 1558|The Act of Supremacy of 1558]] made it a crime to assert the authority of any foreign prince, [[prelate]], or other authority, and was aimed at abolishing the authority of the [[Pope]] in England. A third offence was [[Treason|high treason]] became punishable by death.<ref>Fourteen Catholic bishops appointed by Mary I were dismissed from their sees. "Elizabeth's Religious Settlement, planned meticulously by her chief ministers [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] and [[Nicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper)|Nicholas Bacon]] and already drafted in the first weeks of her reign, made no significant concessions to Catholic opinion represented by the church hierarchy and much of the nobility. There was no question of offering it for inspection by the overwhelming Catholic clerical assemblies, the Convocations of Canterbury and York, and if parliamentary legislation faced still opposition from the Catholic majority in the House of Lords. This meant a delay until April 1559, when two Catholic bishops were arrested on trumped-up charges and the loss of their parliamentary votes resulted in a tiny majority for the government's bills in the house of Lords." MacCulloch, p. 280.</ref> The [[Oath of Supremacy]], imposed by the Act of Supremacy 1558, provided for any person taking public or church office in [[England]] to swear allegiance to the monarch as [[Supreme Governor]] of the [[Church of England]]. Failure to so swear was a crime, although it did not become treason until 1562, when the Supremacy of the Crown Act 1562<ref>5 Eliz.1 c.1</ref> made a second offence of refusing to take the oath treason.

==== Reign of Elizabeth I ====
[[File:Nicholas Hilliard (called) - Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]] by [[Nicholas Hilliard]] (called) - ]]
During the first years of her reign from 1558–1570 there was relative leniency towards Catholics who were willing to keep their religion private, especially if they were prepared to continue to attend their parish churches. The wording of the official prayer book had been carefully designed to make this possible by omitting aggressively "heretical" matter, and at first many English Catholics did in fact worship with their Protestant neighbours, at least until this was formally forbidden by [[Pope Pius V]]'s 1570 bull, ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'', which also declared that Elizabeth was not a rightful queen and should be deposed. It formally excommunicated her and any who obeyed her and obliged all Catholics to attempt to overthrow her.<ref>(Russell, Conrad, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain'', p. 281, [[Oxford University Press]], 1996)</ref>

In response, the "Act to retain the Queen's Majesty's subjects in their obedience", passed in 1581, made it high treason to reconcile anyone or to be reconciled to "the Romish religion", or to procure or publish any papal Bull or writing whatsoever. The celebration of Mass was prohibited under penalty of a fine of two hundred [[Mark (currency)|marks]] and imprisonment for one year for the celebrant, and a fine of one hundred marks and the same imprisonment for those who heard the Mass. This act also increased the penalty for not attending the Anglican service to the sum of twenty pounds a month, or imprisonment until the fine was paid or until the offender went to the Protestant Church. A further penalty of ten pounds a month was inflicted on anyone keeping a schoolmaster who did not attend the Protestant service. The schoolmaster himself was to be imprisoned for one year.<ref>23 Eliz. c. 1 [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11611c.htm Penal Laws]</ref>

England's wars with Catholic powers such as France and Spain, culminated in the attempted invasion by the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588. The Papal bull had unleashed nationalistic feelings which equated Protestantism with loyalty to a highly popular monarch and made Catholics "vulnerable to accusations of being traitors to the crown."<ref>Peter Marshall, ''Heretics and Believers'' (New haven: Yale University Press, 2017), plate #19.</ref> The [[Rising of the North]], the [[Throckmorton plot]] and the [[Babington plot]], together with other subversive activities of supporters of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], all reinforced the association of Catholicism with treachery in the minds of many, notably in middle and southern England.<ref>Krista Kesselring, ''The Northern Rebellion of 1569: Faith, Politics, and Protest in Elizabethan England'' (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007).</ref>

The climax of Elizabeth's persecution of Catholics was reached in 1585, two years before the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, with the [[Act against Jesuits, Seminary priests and other such like disobedient persons]]. This statute, under which most of the [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation|English Catholic martyrs]] were executed, made it high treason for any Jesuit or any seminary priest to be in England at all, and a felony for any one to harbour or relieve them.

The last of Elizabeth's anti-Catholic laws was the Act for the better discovery of wicked and seditious persons terming themselves Catholics, but being rebellious and traitorous subjects. Its effect was to prohibit all [[recusants]] from going more than five miles from their place of abode, and to order all persons suspected of being Jesuits or seminary priests, and not answering satisfactorily, to be imprisoned until they did so.<ref>35 Eliz. c. 2 [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11611c.htm Penal Laws]</ref>
[[File:Mary Queen of Scots by Nicholas Hilliard 1578.jpg|thumb|[[Mary, Queen of Scots]] by [[Nicholas Hilliard]] 1578]]
However, Elizabeth did not believe that her anti-Catholic policies constituted religious persecution. In the context of the uncompromising wording of the Papal Bull against her, she failed to distinguish between those Catholics in conflict with her from those with no such designs.<ref>Darrell Turner "Christian against Christian in 16th century England" ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' 16 September 2005, 13</ref> The number of English Catholics executed under Elizabeth was significant, including [[Edmund Campion]], [[Robert Southwell (jesuit)|Robert Southwell]], and [[Margaret Clitherow]]. Elizabeth herself signed the death warrant of her cousin, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. As MacCulloch has noted, "England judicially murdered more Roman Catholics than any other country in Europe, which puts English pride in national tolerance in an interesting perspective."<ref>MacColloch, ''The Reformation'', 361</ref> So distraught was Elizabeth over Catholic opposition to her throne, she was secretly reaching out to the Ottoman Sultan [[Murad III]], "asking for military aid against Philip of Spain and the 'idolatrous princes' supporting him."<ref>Peter Marshall, ''Heretics and Believers'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2017), 572.</ref>

Because of the persecution in England, Catholic priests were trained abroad at the [[English College, Rome|English College in Rome]], the [[English College, Douai|English College in Douai]], the [[English College, Valladolid|English College at Valladolid in Spain]], and at the English College in Seville. Given that Douai was located in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], part of the dominions of Elizabethan England's greatest enemy, and Valladolid and Seville in Spain itself, they became associated in the public eye with political as well as religious subversion. It was this combination of nationalistic public opinion, sustained persecution, and the rise of a new generation which could not remember pre-Reformation times and had no pre-established loyalty to Catholicism, that reduced the number of Catholics in England during this period – although the overshadowing memory of Queen Mary I's reign was another factor that should not be underestimated (the population of the country was 4.1 million). Nevertheless, by the end of Elizabeth's reign probably 20% of the population were still Catholic, with 10% dissident "Puritan" Protestants and the remainder more or less reconciled to the church as "parish Anglicans". By then most English people had largely been de-catholicised but were not protestant.<ref>Haigh, op.cit.P.&nbsp;290</ref> Religious "uniformity," however, "was a lost cause," given the presence of Dissenting, Nonconformist Protestants, and Catholic minorities.<ref>Marshall, 576-77</ref>

===Stuart period===
The reign of [[James I of England|James I]] (1603–1625) was marked by a measure of tolerance, though less so after the discovery of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] conspiracy of a small group of Catholic conspirators who aimed to kill both King and Parliament and establish a Catholic monarchy. A mix of persecution and tolerance followed: [[Ben Jonson]] and his wife, for example, in 1606 were summoned before the authorities for failure to take communion in the Church of England,<ref>Jonas Barish, ed., ''Ben Jonson'' (Englewood Clifts: [[Prentice-Hall]], 1963), 175.</ref> yet the King tolerated some Catholics at court; for example George Calvert, to whom he gave the title [[Baron Baltimore]], and the [[Duke of Norfolk]], head of the [[Howard family]].

The reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1625–49) saw a small revival of Catholicism in England, especially among the upper classes. As part of the royal marriage settlement Charles's Catholic wife, [[Henrietta Maria]], was permitted her own royal chapel and chaplain. Henrietta Maria was in fact very strict in her religious observances, and helped create a court with continental influences, where Catholicism was tolerated, even somewhat fashionable. Some anti-Catholic legislation became effectively a dead letter. The [[Counter-Reformation]] on the continent of Europe had created a more vigorous and magnificent form of Catholicism (i.e., [[Baroque]], notably found in the architecture and music of Austria, Italy and Germany) that attracted some converts, like the poet [[Richard Crashaw]]. Ironically, the explicitly Catholic artistic movement (i.e., Baroque) ended up "providing the blueprint, after the fire of London, for the first new Protestant churches to be built in England".<ref>John Morrish writing on BBC production, "Baroque! From St. Peter's to St. Paul's" in ''Tablet'' 7 March 2009, 29.</ref>

While Charles remained firmly Protestant, he was personally drawn towards a consciously "High Church" Anglicanism. This affected his appointments to Anglican bishoprics, in particular the appointment of [[William Laud]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. How many Catholics and Puritans there were is still open to debate.<ref>Kevin Phillips ''The Cousins' Wars'' (New York: [[Basic Books]], 1999, 52–3. Phillips says this: "Religious historians beg off from stating firm numbers for either camp. If Puritans probably represented 10–20 percent of the national population, most of them still worshiping within the Church of England, Catholics were much harder to count. Open 'recusants' – Catholics who paid fines to avoid attending the Church of England – numbered sixty thousand in 1640. Many more, however, reluctantly attended services on Sunday with scowls or for as short a time as possible. The more identifiable of these were called 'Church Papists'; the less important, ordinary grumblers who merely talked of preferring the older ceremonies were uncountable. In the north and west, at least half the population outside the towns were Catholic to some degree. By this broad definition, Catholics would have numbered 10–15 percent of the total English population. Practicing Catholics, however, could not have been more than 2–3 percent. Catholicism survived most strongly among the nobility, of whom 15–20 percent clung to the old faith, including many leading magnates in an arc from Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire south to Derby, Worchestershire, and Hereforshire. However, even solidly Protestant East Anglian counties like Suffolk and Essex each had three, four, or a half-dozen aristocratic families holding to the religion of their forebears. This is perhaps one reason why the populace took Catholic 'plots' so seriously: What they called popery was especially visible among the powerful and influential."</ref><ref>Also see: John Morrill's ''The Nature of the English Revolution'' (1993); Conrad Russell's ''The Causes of the English Civil War'' (1990); and Barry Coward's ''The Stuart Age'' 1994).</ref>

Religious conflict between Charles and other "High" Anglicans and [[Calvinists]] – at this stage mostly still within the Church of England (the [[Puritans]]) – formed a strand of the anti-monarchical leanings of the troubled politics of the period. The religious tensions between a court with "[[Papist]]" elements and a Parliament in which the Puritans were strong was one of the major factors behind the [[English Civil War]], in which almost all Catholics supported the King. The victory of the Parliamentarians meant a strongly Protestant and anti-Catholic (and, incidentally, anti-Anglican) regime under [[Oliver Cromwell]].

The restoration of the monarchy under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1660–85) also saw the restoration of a Catholic-influenced court like his father's. However, although Charles himself had Catholic leanings, he was first and foremost a pragmatist and realised the vast majority of public opinion in England was strongly anti-Catholic, so he agreed to laws such as the [[Test Act]] requiring any appointee to any public office or member of Parliament to deny Catholic beliefs such as [[transubstantiation]]. As far as possible, however, he maintained tacit tolerance. Like his father, he married a Catholic, [[Catherine of Braganza]]. (He would become Catholic himself on his deathbed.)
[[File:James II (Ann Killigrew).jpg|190px|thumb|right|[[James II of England|James II]] was the last Catholic to reign as monarch of England (and Scotland and Ireland).]]
Charles' brother and heir James, Duke of York (later [[James II of England|James II]]), converted to Catholicism in 1668–1669. When [[Titus Oates]] in 1678 alleged a (totally imaginary) "[[Popish Plot]]" to assassinate Charles and put James in his place, he unleashed a wave of parliamentary and public hysteria which led to anti-Catholic purges, and another wave of sectarian persecution, which Charles was either unable or unwilling to prevent. Throughout the early 1680s the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] element in Parliament attempted to remove James as successor to the throne. Their failure saw James become, in 1685, Britain's first openly Catholic monarch since Mary I (and last to date). He promised religious toleration for Catholic and Protestants on an equal footing, but it is in doubt whether he did this to gain support from [[Dissenters]] or whether he was truly committed to tolerance (contemporary Catholic regimes in Spain and Italy, for example, were hardly tolerant of Protestantism, while those in France and Poland had practiced forms of toleration).<ref>Mieczysław Biskupski, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QDgaX6q9tycC&pg=PA14&dq=poland+religious+toleration&hl=en&ei=zvnRTMn9O5KW4Abz7tmTDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=poland%20religious%20toleration&f=false ''The History of Poland''], [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood]] 2000, p 14.</ref><ref>Ole Peter Grell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6gFzp6coTYC&pg=PA65&dq=france+religious+toleration&hl=en&ei=VfzRTMmdIeqT4gaSjrHCDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=france%20religious%20toleration&f=false Tolerance and Intolerance in the European Reformation], [[Cambridge University Press]] 2002, p 65.</ref>

James' clear intent to work towards the restoration of the Church of England to the Catholic fold encouraged converts like the poet [[John Dryden]], who wrote "[[The Hind and the Panther]]", celebrating his conversion.<ref>Ackroyd, 185.</ref><ref>Works of John Dryden at [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref> Protestant fears mounted as James placed Catholics in the major commands of the existing standing army, dismissed the Protestant Bishop of London and dismissed the Protestant fellows of Magdalen College and replaced them with a wholly Catholic board. The last straw was the birth of a Catholic heir in 1688, portending a return to a pre-Reformation Catholic dynasty.

===William and Mary and the Church===
In what came to be known as the [[Glorious Revolution]], Parliament deemed James to have abdicated (effectively deposing him, though Parliament refused to call it that) in favor of his Protestant daughter and son-in-law and nephew, [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and [[William III of England|William III]]. Although this affair is celebrated as solidifying both English liberties and the Protestant nature of the kingdom, some argue that it was "fundamentally a coup spearheaded by a foreign army and navy".<ref>Alan Taylor, ''American Colonies'' (New York: Viking, 2001), 278.</ref><ref>The historian Diarmaid MacCulloch says this: "His [James II] replacement on the throne in 1688 by his Dutch son-in-law Willem of Orange was virtually bloodless because the whole English establishment [including the Church of England's [[Seven Bishops]] ] stood by and let it happen, earning the event the name of the Glorious Revolution. This happy title is a disguise for the fact that Willem was (so far) the last foreign ruler to lead a successful military invasion of England, and the English did nothing to stop it."

Her point: the "Glorious Revolution" amounted to a Dutch military takeover with English collaboration.</ref>

James fled into exile, and with him many Catholic nobility and gentry. The [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which remains in operation today, established the royal line through [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], and specifically excludes any Catholic or anyone who marries a Catholic from the throne. This Act was partially changed when the ban on the monarch marrying a Catholic was eliminated (along with the rule of male succession).<ref>John Burns, "British Monarchy Scraps Rule of Male Succession in New Step to Modernization," ''The New York Times'', 28 October 2011.</ref> Still, Catholics today once again are permitted to hold Wolsey and More's office of Lord Chancellor as did Catholics before the Reformation.<ref>Marshall, 577.</ref> Cardinal [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], the last [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] heir to publicly assert a claim to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland, died in Rome in 1807.

===Recusants and moves towards Emancipation===
The years from 1688 to the early 19th century were in some respects the lowest point for Catholicism in England. Deprived of their dioceses, four [[Apostolic Vicariate]]s were set up throughout England until the re-establishment of the diocesan episcopacy in 1850. Although the persecution was not violent as in the past, Catholic numbers, influence and visibility in English society reached their lowest point. The percentage of the population that was Catholic may have declined from 4% in 1700 (population 5.2 millions) to 1% 1800 (population of 7.25 million) with absolute numbers halved.<ref>Historian Antonia Fraser says this about the demographics at this time: "Estimates about the actual number of Catholics vary, as any estimate of a body practicing a religion forbidden by the law of the country must inevitably do. There were probably about 70,000 to 80,000 British Catholics in the 1770s, out of a population of seven million...." Fraser, 24.</ref> Their civil rights were severely curtailed: their right to own property or inherit land was greatly limited, they were burdened with special taxes, they could not send their children abroad for Catholic education, they could not vote, and priests were liable to imprisonment. Writing about the Catholic Church during this time, historian [[Antonia Fraser]] notes:<blockquote> The harsh laws and the live-and-let-live reality were two very different things. This world was divided into the upper classes, the aristocracy and the gentry, and what were literally the working classes. Undoubtedly, the survival of Catholicism in the past [up until 1829] was due to the dogged, but hopefully inconspicuous, protection provided by the former to the latter. Country neighbors, Anglicans and Catholics, lived amicably together in keeping with this "laissez-faire" reality.<ref>Fraser, 25.</ref></blockquote>

There was no longer, as once in Stuart times, any notable Catholic presence at court, in public life, in the military or professions. Many of the Catholic nobles and gentry who had preserved on their lands among their tenants small pockets of Catholicism had followed James into exile, and others, at least outwardly in cryptic fashion, conformed to Anglicanism, meaning fewer such Catholic communities survived intact. For "obvious reasons", Catholic aristocracy at this time was heavily intermarried. Their great houses, however, still had chapels called "libraries", with priests attached to these places (shelved for books) who celebrated Mass, which worship was described in public as "Prayers".<ref>Fraser, 26,27.</ref> Interestingly, one area where the sons of working class Catholics could find religious tolerance was in the army. Generals, for example, did not deny Catholic men their Mass and did not compel them to attend Anglican services, believing that "physical strength and devotion to the military struggle was demanded of them, not spiritual allegiance".<ref>Fraser, 32.</ref> Fraser also notes that the role of the working class among themselves was important: <blockquote> ...servants of various degrees and farm workers, miners, mill workers and tradesmen, responded with loyalty, hard work and gratitude for the opportunity to practice the faith of their fathers (and even more importantly, in many cases, their mothers). Their contributions should not be ignored, even if it is for obvious reasons more difficult to uncover than that of their theoretical superiors. The unspoken survival of the Catholic community in England, despite Penal laws, depended also on these loyal families unknown to history whose existence is recorded as Catholics in Anglican parish registers. That of Walton-le-Dale parish church, near Preston in Lancashire in 1781, for example, records 178 families, with 875 individuals as 'Papists'. Where baptisms are concerned, parental occupations are stated as weaver, husbandman and labourer, with names such as Turner, Wilcock, Balwin and Charnley.<ref>Fraser, 25-6.</ref></blockquote> A bishop at this time (roughly from 1688 to 1850) was called a [[Vicar apostolic]]. A Vicar Apostolic was a [[titular bishop]] (as opposed to a diocesan bishop) through whom the pope exercised jurisdiction over a [[particular church]] territory in England. English-speaking [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] America came under the jurisdiction of the [[Apostolic Vicariate of the London District|Vicar Apostolic of the London]]. As titular bishop over Catholics in British America, he was important to the government not only in regard to its English-speaking North American colonies, but made more so after the [[Seven Years' War]] when the [[British Empire]], in 1763, acquired the French-speaking (and predominantly Catholic) territory of Canada. Only after the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783 and in 1789 with the consecration of [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]], a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]], did the U.S. have its own diocesan bishop, free of the Vicar Apostolic of London, James Robert Talbot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advent.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 January 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419011623/http://www.advent.org/ |archivedate=19 April 2014  }}: John Carroll</ref><ref>Taylor, 429–433.</ref><ref>Ned C.

[[File:Distribution of English Recusant Catholics, 1715-1720.png|thumb|200px|left|Geographical distribution of English Catholic Recusancy, 1715–1720.]]
Most Catholics retreated to relative isolation from a popular Protestant mainstream, and Catholicism in England in this period was politically, if not socially, invisible to history. However, there were exceptions. [[Alexander Pope]], owing to his literary popularity, was one memorable English Catholic of the 18th century. Other memorable Catholics were three remarkable members of the Catholic gentry: [[Baron Petre]] (who wined and dined [[George III]] and [[Queen Charlotte]] at Thorndon Hall), [[Thomas Weld (of Lulworth)|Thomas Weld]] the bibliophile, (and friend of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]) who in 1794 donated his [[Stonyhurst College|Stonyhurst estate]] to the Jesuits to establish a college, along with 30 acres of land, and the Duke of Norfolk, the Premier [[Duke]] in the [[peerage]] of England and as [[Earl of Arundel]], the Premier [[Earl]]. In virtue of his status and as head of the Howard family (which included some Church of England as well as many Catholic members), the Duke was always at Court. It seemed the values and worth of aristocracy "trumped those of the illegal religion".<ref>Fraser, 24–34</ref> Pope, however, seemed to benefit from the isolation. In 1713, when he was 25, he took subscriptions for a project that filled his life for the next seven years, the result being a new version of Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''. [[Samuel Johnson]] pronounced it the greatest translation ever achieved in the English language.<ref>Garry Wills, "On Reading Pope's Homer" ''New York Times Review'' (1 June 1997), 22</ref> Over time, Pope became the greatest poet of the age, the [[Augustan poetry|Augustan Age]], especially for his mock-heroic poems, ''[[Rape of the Lock]]'' and ''[[The Dunciad]]''. Around this time, in 1720, [[Clement XI]] proclaimed Anselm of Canterbury a Doctor of the Church. In 1752, mid-century, Great Britain adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] decreed by Pope [[Gregory XIII]] in 1582. Later in the century there was some liberalization of the anti-Catholic laws on the basis of Enlightenment ideals.

In 1778 the [[Papists Act 1778|Catholic Relief Act]] allowed Catholics to own property, inherit land and join the army, provided they swore an oath of allegiance.<ref>[https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/religion/overview/emancipation/ "Catholic Relief Acts", Parliament UK]</ref> Hardline Protestant mobs reacted in the [[Gordon Riots]] in 1780, attacking any building in London which was associated with Catholicism or owned by Catholics. The [[Catholic Relief Act 1791]] provided further freedoms on condition of swearing an additional oath of acceptance of the Protestant succession in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. This allowed catholic schooling and clergy to operate openly and thus allowed permanent missions to be set up in the larger towns.<ref name=Gerard>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13123a.htm Gerard, John, and Edward D'Alton.

In 1837, [[James Arundell, 10th Baron Arundell of Wardour]], bequeathed to Stonyhurst the Arundel Library, which contained the vast Arundel family collection, including some of the school's most important books and manuscripts such as a Shakespeare ''[[First Folio]]'' and a manuscript copy of Froissart's ''Chronicles'', looted from the body of a dead Frenchman after the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Yet Catholic recusants as a whole remained a small group, except where they stayed the majority religion in various pockets, notably in rural [[Lancashire]] and [[Cumbria]], or were part of the Catholic aristocracy and squirearchy.<ref>Christopher Martin ''A Glimpse of Heaven: Catholic Churches of England and Wales'' (London: [[English Heritage]], 2007)</ref> Finally, the famous recusant [[Maria Fitzherbert]], who during this period secretly married the [[Prince of Wales]], [[Prince Regent]], and future [[George IV]] in 1785.

According to journalist Richard Abbott, "Before the town had a [Catholic] church of its own, she had a priest say Mass at her own house, and invited local Catholics", suggesting the recusants of Brighton were not very undiscovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advent.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 January 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419011623/http://www.advent.org/ |archivedate=19 April 2014  }}: Maria Fitzherbert</ref><ref>Richard Abbott, "Brighton's unofficial queen" ''[[The Tablet]]'', 1 September 2007, 12–13.</ref>

In a 2009 study of the English Catholic community, 1688–1745, Gabriel Glickman notes that Catholics, especially those whose social position gave them access to the courtly centres of power and patronage, had a significant part to play in 18th-century England. They were not as marginal as one might think today. For example, Alexander Pope was not the only Catholic whose contributions (especially, ''Essays on Man'') help define the temper of an early English Enlightenment. In addition to Pope, Glickman notes, a Catholic architect, [[James Gibbs]], returned baroque forms to the London skyline and a Catholic composer, [[Thomas Arne]], composed "Rule Britannia". According to reviewer Aidan Bellenger, Glickman also suggests that "rather than being the victims of the Stuart failure, 'the unpromising setting of exile and defeat' had 'sown the seed of a frail but resilient English Catholic Enlightenment'."<ref>Aidan Bellenger, "Left foot forward", ''The Tablet'', 10 October 2009, 24.

=== Nineteenth century and Irish immigration ===
[[File:Daniel O'Connell.png|thumb|Irish statesman, [[Daniel O'Connell]], influenced the passage of the [[Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829]]]]
{{Main|Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829}}
After this moribund period, the first signs of a revival occurred as thousands of French Catholics fled France during the [[French Revolution]]. The leaders of the Revolution were virulently anti-Catholic, even singling out priests and nuns for [[summary execution]] or massacre, and England was seen as a safe haven from [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] violence. Also around this time (1801), a new political entity was formed, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], which merged the Kingdom of Great Britain with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], thus increasing the number of Catholics in the new state. Pressure for abolition of anti-Catholic laws grew, particularly with the need for Catholic recruits to fight in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite the resolute opposition of [[George IV]],<ref name="dnb">{{Cite journal |last=Hibbert |first=Christopher |title=George IV (1762–1830) |journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004}}</ref> which delayed fundamental reform, 1829 brought a major step in the liberalisation of most anti-Catholic laws, though some aspects were to remain on the statute book into the 21st century.<ref>Michael Wheeler, ''The Old Enemies: Catholic and Protestant in nineteenth-century English Culture'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007)</ref> Parliament passed the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]], giving Catholic men almost equal civil rights, including the right to vote and to hold most public offices. If Catholics were rich, however, exceptions were always made, even before the changes. For example, American ministers to the [[Court of St. James's]] were often struck by the prominence of wealthy American-born Catholics, titled ladies among the nobility, like Louisa (Caton), granddaughter of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], and her two sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth. After Louisa's first husband ([[Felton Hervey-Bathurst|Sir Felton Bathurst-Hervey]]) died, Louisa later married the [[Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, 7th Duke of Leeds|son]] of the Duke of Leeds, and had the [[Duke of Wellington]] as her European protector. Her sister Mary Ann married the Marquess of Wellesley, the brother of the Duke of Wellington; and her other sister Elizabeth (Lady Stafford) married another British nobleman.<ref>Grace Donovan "An American Catholic in Victorian England: Louisa, Duchess of Leeds, and the Carroll Family Benefice", ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' Vol. 84, No. 3, Fall, 1898, 223–234.</ref><ref>Wellington to Hervey, 3 July 1817, Leeds papers, [[Yorkshire Archaeological Society]].</ref><ref>Charles Carroll to Mary Caton, 28 January 1789; to Louisa, 19 September 1803, Carroll Microfilm.</ref><ref>John Carroll to Charles Carroll, 15 July 1800, Caroll papers, Ms. 216, Maryland Historical Society.</ref> Though British law required an Anglican marriage service, each of the sisters and their Protestant spouses had a Catholic ceremony afterwards.

In the 1840s and 1850s, especially during the [[Great Irish Famine]], while much of the large outflow of migration from Ireland was headed to the United States to seek work, hundreds of thousands of Irish people also migrated across the channel to England and Scotland and established communities in cities there, including London, [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]] and [[Glasgow]], but also in towns and villages up and down the country, thus giving Catholicism in England a numerical boost.

==Reestablished dioceses==
At various points after the 16th century hopes have been entertained by many English Catholics that the "reconversion of England" was at hand. Additionally, with the arrival of Irish Catholic migrants (Ireland was part of the UK until the partition, in 1922), some considered that a "second spring" of Catholicism across Britain was developing. Rome responded by [[Universalis Ecclesiae|re-establishing the Catholic hierarchy in 1850]], creating 12 Catholic dioceses in England from existing [[apostolic vicariates]] and appointing diocesan bishops (to replace earlier titular bishops) with fixed sees on a more traditional Catholic pattern. The Catholic Church in England and Wales had had 22 dioceses immediately before the Reformation, but none of the current 22 bear close resemblance (geographically) to the 22 earlier pre-Reformation dioceses.<ref>{{cite book|author=Saho Matsumoto-Best|title=Britain and the Papacy in the Age of Revolution, 1846–1851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bf7ET-KAvsC&pg=PA137|year=2003|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|pages=137–70|isbn=9780861932658}}</ref>

The re-established Catholic episcopacy specifically avoided using places that were sees of the Church of England, in effect temporarily abandoning the titles of Catholic dioceses before Elizabeth I because of the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851]], which in England favoured a state church (i.e., Church of England) and denied [[Coat of arms|arms]] and legal existence to territorial Catholic sees on the basis that the state could not grant such "privileges" to "entities" that allegedly did not exist in law. Some of the Catholic dioceses, however, took the titles of bishoprics which had previously existed in England but were no longer used by the Anglican Church (e.g. Beverley – later divided into Leeds and Middlesbrough, Hexham '''–''' later changed to Hexham and Newcastle). In the few cases where a Catholic diocese bears the same title as an Anglican one in the same town or city (e.g., Birmingham, Liverpool, Portsmouth, and Southwark), this is the result of the Church of England ignoring the prior existence there of a Catholic see and of the technical repeal of the Ecclesiastical Titles Act in 1871. The Act applied only to England and Wales, not Scotland or Ireland; thus official recognition afforded by the [[grant of arms]] to the [[Archdiocese of St Andrews]] and Edinburgh, brought into being by Lord Lyon in 1989, relied on the fact that the Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851 never applied to Scotland.<ref>Adrian Turner, "Taking up arms", ''[[The Tablet]]'', 9 September 1989, 1027</ref> In recent times, the former Conservative Cabinet Minister [[John Gummer]], a prominent convert to Catholicism and columnist for the ''[[Catholic Herald]]'' in 2007, objected to the fact that no Catholic diocese could have the same name as an Anglican diocese (such as London, Canterbury, Durham, etc.) "even though those dioceses had, shall we say, been borrowed".<ref>Isabel de Bertodano "Bill demands end to anti-Catholic laws", ''[[The Tablet]]'', 24 February 2007, 36</ref>

===Converts===
[[File:John_Henry_Newman_by_Sir_John_Everett_Millais,_1st_Bt.jpg|thumb|[[John Henry Newman]]]]
A proportion of the Anglicans who were involved in the [[Oxford Movement]] or "Tractarianism" were ultimately led beyond these positions and converted to the Catholic Church, including, in 1845, the movement's principal intellectual leader, [[John Henry Newman]]. More new Catholics would come from the Anglican Church, often via high Anglicanism, for at least the next hundred years, and something of this continues.<ref>William James Gordon-Gorman, ''Converts to Rome: a biographical list of the more notable converts to the Catholic Church in the United Kingdom'' (1910) [https://archive.org/details/a583403600gorduoft online]</ref>

As anti-Catholicism declined sharply after 1910, the Church grew in numbers, grew rapidly in terms of priests and sisters, and expanded their parishes from inner city industrial areas to more salubrious suburbs. Although underrepresented in the higher levels of the social structure, apart from a few old aristocratic Catholic families, Catholic talent was emerging in journalism, literature, the arts, and diplomacy.

A striking development was the surge in highly publicised conversion of intellectuals and writers including most famously [[G. K. Chesterton]], as well as [[Robert Hugh Benson]] and [[Ronald Knox]],<ref>George Marshall, George. "Two Autobiographical Narratives of Conversion: Robert Hugh Benson and Ronald Knox."

Anscombe]] was also a very famous convert during the early 20th century.

Prominent cradle Catholics included the film director, [[Alfred Hitchcock]], writers such as [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[Lord Acton]], and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and the composer [[Edward Elgar]], whose oratorio ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]'' was based on a 19th-century poem by Newman. 

===Contemporary English Catholicism===

English Catholicism continued to grow throughout the first two-thirds of the 20th century, when it was associated primarily with elements in the English intellectual class and the ethnic Irish population. Numbers attending Mass remained very high in stark contrast with the Anglican church (although not to other Protestant churches),<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica. Statistics are for "full members of certain churches in England and Wales." The 1929 edition records 2,294,000 Anglicans, 1,939,700 other Protestants (Methodists, Congregationalists, Baptists, etc.), 1,930,000 Catholics, and "about 300,000" Jews. The 1953 edition records 3,186,093 Anglicans, 2,528,200 Catholics, 1,709,245 other Protestants, and "about 400,000" Jews.</ref> Clergy numbers, which began the 20th century at under 3,000, reached a high of 7,500 in 1971.<ref name="Leyshon"/>

By the latter years of the twentieth century low numbers of vocations also affected the church<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/the-pope/7996573/A-visit-that-reflects-our-changing-times.html | location=London | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | first=Eamon | last=Duffy | title=Pope visit: A visit that reflects our changing times | date=11 September 2010}}</ref> with ordinations to the priesthood dropping from the hundreds in the late 20th century into the teens in 2006–2011 (16 in 2009 for example) and a recovery into the 20s thereafter, with a prediction for 2018 of 24.<ref>http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/Catholic-Church/Media-Centre/Press-Releases/press_releases_2009/growing_trend_to_spend_a_year_discovering_priesthood_before_entering_seminary {{dead link|date=January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ukvocation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Stats-for-Bishops-Conference-2015.pdf |title=Vocation Statistics 2015 |website=ukvocation.org |access-date=28 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aecbe37e-911f-11df-b297-00144feab49a.html|title=Spiritual shepherds fail to flock to rural parishes (Subscribe to read)|work=[[Financial Times]]}}</ref>

As in other English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia, the movement of Irish Catholics out of the working-class into the middle-class suburban mainstream often meant their assimilation with broader, secular English society and loss of a separate Catholic identity. The [[Second Vatican Council]] has been followed, as in other Western countries, by divisions between [[Traditionalist Catholicism]] and a more liberal form of Catholicism claiming inspiration from the Council. This caused difficulties for not a few pre-conciliar converts, though others have still joined the Church in recent decades (for instance, [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], [[Alec Guinness]], and [[Joseph Pearce]]). And public figures (often descendants of the recusant families) include [[Timothy Radcliffe]], former Master of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) and writer. Radcliffe is related to three late cardinals – [[Cardinal Weld|Weld]], [[Cardinal Vaughan|Vaughan]] and [[Basil Hume|Hume]] (the last because his cousin Lord Hunt is married to Hume's sister) – and his family is connected to many of the great recusant English Catholic families, the Arundels, Tichbournes, Talbots, Stourtons, Stonors, Welds and Blundells.<ref>"An enigma wrapped in a cowl", ''[[The Tablet]]'', 17/24 December 2005, 8</ref> There were also the families whose male line has died out such as the Grimshaws, the de la Barre Bodenhams or the Lubienski-Bodenhams.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tanner, Bill |title = Preservation proposed for the remains of Rotherwas House|journal=Hereford Times |date=21 January 2015|url= https://www.herefordtimes.com/news/11739475.preservation-proposed-for-the-remains-of-rotherwas-house/}}</ref> Among others in this group are [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]]; [[Peter Ackroyd]]; Antonia Fraser; [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]], [[Director General of the BBC]]; [[Michael Martin (politician)|Michael Martin]], first Catholic to hold the office of [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] since the Reformation; [[Chris Patten]], first Catholic to hold the post of [[Chancellor]] of Oxford since the Reformation; [[Piers Paul Read]]; Helen Liddel, Britain's High Commissioner to Australia; and former Prime Minister's wife, [[Cherie Blair]], These have no difficulty making their Catholicism known in public life.

Since the [[Second Vatican Council]] (Vatican II) the Church in England has tended to focus on ecumenical dialogue with the Anglican Church rather than winning converts from it as in the past.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} However, the 1990s have seen a number of conversions from Anglicanism to the Catholic Church, largely prompted by the Church of England's decision to ordain women as priests (among other moves away from traditional doctrines and structures).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The resultant converts included members of the Royal Family ([[Katharine, Duchess of Kent]], her son [[Lord Nicholas Windsor]] and her grandson [[Baron Downpatrick]]), [[Graham Leonard]] (former Anglican Bishop of London), [[Frances Shand Kydd]] (maternal grandmother of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex]]), and a number of Anglican priests. Converts to Catholicism in Britain occur for any number of reasons, not least from "the mystical buoyant instinct" within each person to grow toward a profounder expression of what they believe.<ref>Sigrid Undset, Stages on the Road (Notre Dame: Christian Classics/[[Ave Maria Press]], 2012); Thomas Merton, Seven Storey Mountain (New York: [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt, Brace, and Co.]], 1948) or in the [[New American Library]] paperback.</ref> In 2019, Charles Moore, former editor of ''The Spectator,'' ''The Daily Telegraph,'' and authorized biographer of [[Margaret Thatcher]], noted that his conversion in 1994 to Catholicism followed the Church of England's decision to ordain women, "unilaterally." The Church of England's "determination to do this," he said, "willy-nilly, come what may, meant that they weren't serious about Christian unity, because the Catholic and Orthodox had a different view."<ref>Peter Stanford, "Himself alone," ''The Tablet,'' 26 October 2019 www.thetablet.co.uk</ref>

The spirit of ecumenism fostered by Vatican II resulted in 1990 with the Catholic Church in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland joining [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]] as an expression of the churches' commitment to work ecumenically. In 2006, for example, a memorial was put up to St [[John Houghton (martyr)|John Houghton]] and fellow [[Carthusian]] monks martyred at the [[London Charterhouse]], 1535. Anglican priest Geoffrey Curtis campaigned for it with the current archbishop of Canterbury's blessing.<ref>"Ut unum sint", ''The Tablet'' 6 May 2006, 18</ref> Also, in another ecumenical gesture, a plaque in Holywell Street, Oxford, now commemorates the Catholic martyrs of England. It reads: "Near this spot [[George Nichols (martyr)|George Nichols]], [[Richard Yaxley]], [[Thomas Belson]], and [[Humphrey Pritchard]] were executed for their Catholic faith, 5 July 1589."<ref>Thomas Norton, "When is a martyr a traitor?" ''The Tablet'' 25 October 2008, 16–17.</ref> This action, however, did not please some Catholics, as the chair of the Latin Mass Society, Jospeh Shaw, noted in a letter dated 2020: "As Mgr. Ronald Knox pointed out: 'Each of them [martyrs] died in the belief that he was bearing witness to the truth; and if you accept both testimonies undiscriminately, then you are making nonsense of them both.'" <ref>Joseph Shaw,  "Martyrs' memorial," The Tablet, 16 November, 2020, 16.</ref>  And at Lambeth Palace, in February 2009, the Archbishop of Canterbury hosted a reception to launch a book, ''Why Go To Church?'', by Fr Timothy Radcliffe OP, one of Britain's best known religious and the former master of the Dominican Order. A large number of young Dominican [[friars]] attended. Fr Radcliffe said, "I don't think there have been so many Dominicans in one place since the time of Robert Kilwardby, the Dominican Archbishop of Canterbury in the 13th century."<ref>"Just good friends", ''The Tablet'', 28 February 2009, 18.</ref>

Currently, along with the 22 [[Latin Church]] dioceses, there are two dioceses of the [[Eastern Catholic Church]]:<ref>In the decree on Eastern Catholic Churches (''Orientalium Ecclesiarum''), Vatican II insists that Eastern Catholic communities are true churches and not just rites within the Catholic Church (n.2).</ref> the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Holy Family of London]] and the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Eparchy of Great Britain]].

=== Social action ===
The Church's principles of social justice influenced initiatives to tackle the challenges of poverty and social inclusion. In Southampton, Fr Pat Murphy O'Connor founded the St Dismas Society as an agency to meet the needs of ex-prisoners discharged from Winchester prison. Some of St Dismas Society's early members went on to help found the Simon Community in Sussex then in London. Their example gave new inspiration to other clergy, such as the Revd Kenneth Leech (CofE) of [[St Anne's Church, Soho]], who helped found the homeless charity [[Centrepoint (charity)|Centrepoint]], and the Revd Bruce Kenrick (Church of Scotland) who helped found the homeless charity [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]]. In 1986 Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] established the Cardinal Hume Centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardinalhumecentre.org.uk|title=The Cardinal Hume Centre}}</ref> to work with homeless young people, badly housed families and local communities to access accommodation, support and advice, education, training and employment opportunities.

In 2006 Cardinal [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]] instituted an annual Mass in Support of Migrant Workers<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rcdow.org.uk/massformigrants |title=Mass in Support of Migrant Workers |access-date=16 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616011920/http://www.rcdow.org.uk/massformigrants/ |archive-date=16 June 2008 |url-status = dead }}</ref> at Westminster Cathedral in partnership with the ethnic chaplains of Brentwood, Southwark and Westminster.

==Adoption controversy==
On 3 November 2016, John Bingham, Head of Media at the Church of England, reported in ''The Daily Telegraph'' that Cardinal [[Vincent Nichols]] officially acknowledged that the Catholic Church in England and Wales had pressured young unmarried mothers in the country to put their children up for adoption in agencies linked to the Catholic Church throughout the decades following World War II and offered an apology.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/03/cardinals-apology-to-mothers-over-babies-handed-over-for-adoptio/|title=Cardinal's apology to mothers over babies handed over for adoption|author=John Bingham|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 November 2016|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>

==Child Abuse scandal==
In November 2020 the [[Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse]] reported that between 1970 and 2015, the church in England and Wales had received more than 900 complaints involving more than 3,000 instances of child sexual abuse, made against almost 1,000 individuals, including priests, monks and church associates. In light of such serious and persistent allegations over decades, the Inquiry had hoped to gain the cooperation of the Vatican. In the event its repeated requests were thwarted. As a result, there have been calls for resignations of prelates in leadership roles both from victims, their families and supporters. The inquiry has not spared criticism of the church for prioritising its reputation over the suffering of victims. Cardinal Nichols was singled out in the inquiry report for lack of personal responsibility, or of compassion towards victims. However he has indicated he would not be resigning as he was "determined to put it right".<ref>Catherine Pepinster, "Abusive Church betrayed its moral purpose," ''The Tablet'', 10 November 2020. </ref> <ref>Owen Bowcott and Harriet Sherwood, "Child sexual abuse in Catholic church 'swept under the carpet,' inquiry finds -- Leader of church in England and Wales refusing to resignng despite damning IICSA report, ''The Guardian'', 10 November, 2020.</ref> In another article by Pepinster, she notes that the late Cardinal Basil Hume was "remembered for showing empathy to survivors but offered only pastoral care and kindness." <ref>Catherine Pepinster, "Voices of suffering and survival," ''The Tablet'', 14 November, 2020, 4-5.</ref>

==Organisation==
[[File:English and Welsh Catholic Dioceses Map.png|thumb|right|Dioceses in England and Wales]]
The Catholic Church in England and Wales has five [[Ecclesiastical province|provinces]]: Birmingham, Cardiff, Liverpool, Southwark and Westminster. There are 22 [[diocese]]s which are divided into [[parish]]es (for comparison, the Church of England and Church in Wales currently have a total of 50 dioceses). In addition to these, there are four dioceses covering England and Wales for specific groups which are the [[Bishopric of the Forces]], the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Holy Family of London|Eparchy for Ukrainians]], the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Eparchy of Great Britain]] and the [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham|Personal Ordinariate for former Anglicans]].

The Catholic bishops in England and Wales come together in a collaborative structure known as the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales]]. Currently the [[Archbishop of Westminster]], [[Vincent Gerard Nichols]], is the [[President (corporate title)|president]] of the Bishops' Conference. For this reason in the global Catholic Church (outside England), he is ''de facto'' Primate of England though not in the eyes of English law and the established Church of England. Historically, the avoidance of the title of "Primate" was to eschew whipping up anti-Catholic tension, in the same way the bishops of the restored hierarchy avoided using current titles of Anglican sees (Archbishop of Westminster rather than "Canterbury" or "London"). However, the Archbishop of Westminster had certain privileges: he was the only metropolitan in the country until 1911 (when the archdioceses of Birmingham and Liverpool were created) and he has always acted as leader at meetings of the English bishops.

Although the bishops of the restored hierarchy were obliged to take new titles, such as that of Westminster, they saw themselves very much in continuity with the pre-Reformation Church. Westminster in particular saw itself as the continuation of Canterbury, hence the similarity of the [[coat of arms]] of the two sees (with Westminster believing it has more right to it since it features the [[pallium]], no longer given to Anglican archbishops). At the back of Westminster Cathedral is a [[list of Popes]] and, alongside this, a list of Catholic Archbishops of Canterbury beginning with Augustine of Canterbury and the year they received the pallium. After Cardinal Pole, the last Catholic incumbent of Canterbury, the names of the Catholic vicars apostolic or titular bishops (from 1685) are recorded and then the Archbishops of Westminster, in one unimpaired line, from 597 to the present, according to the Archdiocese of Westminster.<ref>For a general study in this area, see Nicholas Schofield and Gerard Skinner, ''The English Cardinals'' (London: Family Publications, 2007)</ref><ref>Michael Walsh ''Westminster Cardinals'' London: [[Burns & Oates]], 2009 {{ISBN|0-86012-459-2}}</ref> To highlight this historical continuity, dating back to Pope Gregory I's appointment of Augustine and his sequent bestowal of the pallium on the appointee, the installation rites of pre-Reformation Catholic Archbishops of Canterbury and earlier Archbishops of Westminster were used at the installation of the current Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Gerard Nichols.<ref>Elena Curti and Christopher Lamb, "Cathedral countdown to installation", ''The Tablet'', 16 May 2009, 39.</ref><ref>Lucy Wooding, "Binding Identities," ''The Tablet'', 26 June 2011, 26</ref><ref>" Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols is made cardinal," ''The Telegraph'', 22 February 2014</ref> He also became the forty-third of the [[List of English cardinals|English cardinals]] since the 12th century.

In October 2009, following closed-circuit talks between some Anglicans and the [[Holy See]], Pope Benedict made a relatively unconditional offer to accommodate disaffected Anglicans in the Church of England, enabling them, for the first time, to retain parts of their liturgy and heritage under ''[[Anglicanorum coetibus]]'', while being in full communion with Rome. By April 2012 the UK ordinariate numbered about 1200, including five bishops and 60 priests.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2012/04/11/over-3500-adults-received-into-church-in-holy-week/|title=Over 3,500 adults received into the Church in England and Wales – CatholicHerald.co.uk|newspaper=[[The Catholic Herald]]|access-date=11 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413214216/http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2012/04/11/over-3500-adults-received-into-church-in-holy-week/|archive-date=13 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Richard Ormrod, "Mixed Blessings", ''The Tablet'', 15 October 2011.</ref> The ordinariate has recruited a group of aristocrats as honorary vice-presidents to help out.

===Eastern Catholic Churches===
[[File:Wolverhampton Ukrainian Catholic Church.jpg|thumb|A [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Greek Catholic]] parish church in [[Wolverhampton]], England]]

There exists the [[Apostolic Exarchate for Ukrainians]] which serves the 15,000 Ukrainian Greek Catholics in Great Britain, with a cathedral and various churches across the country.

The [[Lebanese Maronite Order]] (LMO) runs in England and Wales. The LMO is an order of the [[Maronite Catholic Church]], serving Maronite Catholics in England and Wales. The Revd Augustine Aoun is the parish priest for Maronites. The LMO runs a few churches, for example Our Lady of Sorrows in Paddington and Our Lady of Lebanon in Swiss Cottage.

There are also Catholic chaplains involved in the ministries of [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] (of Eritrean, Chaldean, Syriac, Syro-Malabar, Syro-Malankara, and Melkite communities). For information about the Syro-Malabar chaplaincy within the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster|Diocese of Westminster]] in London, see [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church of London]].

==Demography==

The spiritual needs of migrating Catholic Poles in England and Wales over the past two centuries have been tied inexorably to the changing geo-political fate of their homeland. Most of the arrivals up to the 21st century were escaping political and other repressions. They were not all Catholics.

On the [[accession of Poland to the European Union]] in 2004 there has been large-scale Polish immigration to the UK, up to 900 000 people as of 2017 have come.<ref name=ONSPopEstimates>{{cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/datasets/populationoftheunitedkingdombycountryofbirthandnationality |title=Dataset: Population of the United Kingdom by Country of Birth and Nationality |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=2017-05-26}}</ref> The [[Polish Catholic Mission]] reports that only about 10% of the newly arrived Poles attend church regularly.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.pcmew.org/site/assets/files/3083/2016_statuty_pcmew.pdf|language=pl|title=Polish Catholic Mission - Statutes - History|page= 9|access-date=2020-07-18}}</ref> For those it has around 219 branches and pastoral centres with 114 priests.<ref>''Polish Bishops may loosen grip on British mission churches'' – ''[[The Tablet]]'', 26 January 2008</ref> The Vicars Delegate who manage the "chaplaincy" of the Polish Catholic Mission since then have been Mgr.

The postholder since 2011 has been Bishop Wiesław Cichowski. ''The Tablet'' reported in December 2007 that the Polish Catholic Mission as stating that its branches follow a pastoral programme set by the Polish conference of bishops and are viewed as "an integral part of the Polish church".<ref>''Polish anger mounts over cardinal's criticism'' – ''[[The Tablet]]'', 22/29 December 2007</ref>

====History====
Polish-speaking Catholics first arrived in the United Kingdom in some numbers after the 19th century national [[November Uprising|insurgencies]] in [[January 1863 uprising|1831 and 1863]] which had arisen, especially in the Russian sector, in the wake of the [[Partitions of Lithuanian - Polish commonwealth|Partitions of the Lithuanian - Polish commonwealth]] during the late 18th century. In 1864 through the efforts of general [[Wladyslaw Stanislaw Zamoyski|Zamoyski]] and [[Cardinal Wiseman]], Rev. Chwaliszewski was invited to come to London and lead services in the Polish chapel at St. Peter's [[Hatton Garden]]. Worthy of note in this period was the Polish figure of [[The Venerable]] [[Bernard Łubieński]] (1846-1933) closely associated with [[Robert Coffin (bishop)|Bishop Robert Coffin]] and who, after an education at [[Ushaw College]], in 1864 entered the [[Redemptorists]] at [[Clapham]] and spent some years as a missionary in the British Isles, before returning to his native land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/30th-september-1933/21/obituary|title=Obituary "The Rev. Bernard Lubienski, C.SS.R"&nbsp;– from the Tablet Archive|website=Archive.thetablet.co.uk|accessdate=2016-08-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013172211/http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/30th-september-1933/21/obituary|archive-date=October 13, 2017|url-status=dead}}p.437 (a subscription may now be necessary)</ref> 

The [[Polish Catholic Mission]] was placed on a permanent footing in [[1894]] by [[Cardinal Vaughan]], the then [[Archbishop of Westminster]]. The nucleus of the mission and its chaplaincy was formed by [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Franciszka Siedliska]] (1842-1902), founder of the [[Congregation of the Holy Family of Nazareth]] and its spiritual director, rev. Lechert [[Congregation of the Resurrection|CR]]. Sr. Siedliska and two sisters started a Polish language primary school. From then on Polish services were regularly held in a chapel first in Globe Street, then in Cambridge Heath Road in [[Bethnal Green]] in the [[East End of London]], where most exiled Poles were living at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nazarethcsfn.org/news/honor-our-foundress-on-her-feast-day/|title=Honor our Foundress on her feast day|date=21 November 2016|publisher=Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref>

After [[World War I]], the Polish chaplaincy was in the rented Polish church in Mercer Street in North London. In 1928 the local authority condemned the building as unsafe. That same year the exiled community was visited by cardinal [[Aleksander Kakowski]] with bishop Przeździeński from the diocese of [[Siedlce]] and Polish ambassador, [[Konstanty Skirmunt]]. After an extended search, a building was bought from the [[Swedenborg Society]] in Devonia Road, Islington. [[Cardinal Bourne]] of Westminster, helped the mission with a £1000 loan for refurbishment. It became the first Polish-owned ecclesiastical building in the British Isles. It was consecrated on 30 October 1930 by cardinal [[August Hlond]], primate of Poland in the presence of cardinal Bourne. In 1938 rev. Władysław Staniszewski became chaplain to the mission.

After [[World War I]], the pastoral task had swelled to almost 200,000 [[displaced people]] - mainly soldiers. Many Polish servicemen were unable to return to their homeland following the annexation of half of Poland's territory by the [[USSR]] and the imposition of a communist regime in the newly reconfigured Poland. The [[Polish Resettlement Corps]] was formed by the British government to ease their transition into British life. They were joined by several thousand Displaced Persons (DPs), many of whom were their family members. This influx of Poles gave rise to the [[Polish Resettlement Act 1947]] which allowed approximately 250,000 Polish Servicemen and their dependents to settle in Britain. [[Polish British|Many assimilated]] into existing Catholic congregations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polishcatholicmission.org.uk|title=Polish & Catholic Missionary Dating|access-date=2 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223192023/http://www.polishcatholicmission.org.uk/|archive-date=23 December 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> Among them were also 120 [[Military Chaplain|Military chaplain]]s and priests, along with a minority of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Lutheran]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]] christians with their own chaplains. There was also a minority Jewish contingent and a handful of [[Muslims]] among the soldiers.

[[File:Kościół sw. Andrzeja Boboli 1.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Andrew Bobola Church, Hammersmith]] regarded as the Polish "garrison" church]]
In 1948, following a visit to Poland the previous year for talks with cardinal Hlond, and after consulting with the Catholic episcopate of England and Wales, Cardinal [[Bernard Griffin]] nominated the rector of the Polish Catholic Mission, rev. Staniszewski as ''Vicar delegate for civilian Poles in England and Wales'', with the powers of an [[Military ordinariate|Ordinariate]]. Around this time Archbishop Hlond had nominated Bishop [[Józef Gawlina]], also a [[Divisional general]] and based in [[Rome, Italy|Rome]], to be responsible overall for the [[Polish diaspora]].<ref>Kunert, A. K. ed. (2002)."Józef Feliks Gawlina Biskup Polowy Polskich Sił Zbrojnych" in ''Emigracyjna Rzeczpospolita 1939-1990'', vol. III. Warsaw.(in Polish)</ref> Between them, this enabled the then rector in England to engage priests and organize regular pastoral care across 18 dioceses in England and Wales. The Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales agreed to the appointment of a ''Vicar Delegate'', nominated by the Polish Episcopate, with ordinary power over the Polish clergy throughout England and Wales, with certain exceptions relating to [[Christian marriage|marriage]].

On the pastoral front, the temporary Polish parish hosted in [[Central London]] by the fathers of [[Brompton Oratory]] was able to be moved westward in 1962 to the newly acquired [[St Andrew Bobola Church, Hammersmith|St Andrew Bobola]] church in [[Shepherd's Bush]], the second Polish owned church in London since 1930. It is regarded as an unofficial garrison church with memorials to many historical [[Polish Army]] regiments.<ref name = "Best">{{cite book|authors=P.Best; M.Reczek; A.Suchcitz|title= Kronika Kościoła Św.

====Anomalous Polish "parishes"====
[[File:Fawley Court-1342938830.jpg|thumb|left|The erstwhile Polish [[Divine Mercy College]] at [[Fawley Court]], Buckinghamshire]]
Since the original agreement between the English and Polish church hierarchies in 1948, whenever a Polish Catholic community emerges within England and Wales, the vicar delegate appoints a Polish priest to organise a local branch of the Polish Catholic Mission. A priest thus appointed is the Catholic version of a "[[priest in charge]]", but he is not actually a parish priest. There are strictly no Polish parishes or ''quasiparishes'' in England and Wales (in accordance with [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Canons]] 515 §1 and 516 §1) with the exception of the original church on Devonia Road in [[Islington]]. A Polish community is sometimes referred to as a "parish", but is not a parish in the canonical sense. Hence the Polish community attending a "Polish church" is not a "[[judicial person]]". The canonical judicial person which represents the interests of all Polish communities of worship is vested in the Polish Catholic Mission.<ref name="cbcew">{{Cite web |url=http://directory.cbcew.org.uk/search.php?pageType=groupView&ID=7742 |title= Polish Catholic Mission in England and Wales For Polish Catholics in England and Wales |website=directory.cbcew.org.uk |access-date=28 January 2019}}</ref>

In December 2007, Cardinal [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]] said: "I'm quite concerned that Poles are creating a separate Church in Britain – I would want them to be part of the Catholic life of this country. I would hope those responsible for the Polish Church here, and the Poles themselves, will be aware that they should become a part of local parishes as soon as possible when they learn enough of the language." Mgr Kukla stressed that the Polish Catholic Mission continues to have a "good relationship" with the hierarchy in England and Wales and said "Integration is a long process".<ref>:Britain's Polish immigrants 'are abandoning faith'",''[[Catholic Herald]]'', 31 December 2007.</ref>

The Polish Catholic Mission co-operated with the English hierarchy's 2008 research inquiry into the needs of migrants in London's Catholic community. The inquiry had been commissioned by the [[Archdiocese of Westminster]], Archbishop [[Kevin McDonald (bishop)|Kevin McDonald]] of [[Diocese of Southwark|Southwark]] and Bishop [[Thomas McMahon (bishop)|Thomas McMahon]] of [[Diocese of Brentwood|Brentwood]]. Around 1000 people attending Mass in three London dioceses were surveyed using anonymous questionnaires available in Polish, Lithuanian, Chinese, French, Spanish, Portuguese and English. The congregations were drawn from mainstream diocesan parishes, ethnic chaplaincies and churches of the Polish vicariate. The report findings described how 86% of eastern Europeans said the availability of Mass in their mother-tongue was a reason for their choosing to worship in a particular church. One of the report's recommendations emphasised cooperation with key overseas bishops conferences, dioceses and [[religious institute]]s on the recruitment and appointment of ethnic chaplains.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theprincipledsociety.com/ |title=Francis Davis |access-date=19 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822145517/http://theprincipledsociety.com/ |archive-date=22 August 2018 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.vhi.org.uk/public/uploads/pdfs/articles/7955-140207123751-report_1b(1).pdf ''The Ground of Justice: The report of a pastoral research enquiry into the needs of migrants in London's Catholic community.
