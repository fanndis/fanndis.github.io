'''County Cork''' ({{lang-ga|Contae Chorcaí}}) is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is the largest and southernmost county of Ireland, situated in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]] and named after the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland's second-largest city. The [[Cork County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county. Its largest market towns are [[Mallow, County Cork|Mallow]], [[Macroom]], [[Midleton]], and [[Skibbereen]]. In 2016, the county's population was 542,868, making it the third-[[List of Irish counties by population|most populous]] county in Ireland.<ref name=cso2016City/><ref name=cso2016County/> Notable Corkonians include [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[Jack Lynch]], and [[Sonia O'Sullivan]].

Cork borders four other counties: [[County Kerry|Kerry]] to the west, [[County Limerick|Limerick]] to the north, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] to the north-east and [[County Waterford|Waterford]] to the east. The county contains a section of the [[Golden Vale]] pastureland that stretches from [[Kanturk]] in the north to [[Allihies]] in the south. The south-west region, including [[West Cork]], is one of Ireland's main tourist destinations,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/tourism-ireland-4-3506617-Jul2017/ |newspaper=TheJournal.ie |title=Ireland's most popular tourist counties and attractions have been revealed |date=23 July 2017 |accessdate=15 October 2017 |quote="the southwest, comprising Cork and Kerry, has the second-largest spend by tourists [after the Dublin region]"}}</ref> known for its rugged coast and [[List of megalithic monuments in Cork|megalithic monuments]] and as the starting point for the [[Wild Atlantic Way]]. The largest third-level institution is [[University College Cork]], founded in 1845, with an undergraduate population of around 15,000. Local industry and employers include technology company [[Dell EMC]], the European headquarters of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Dairygold]], which owns milk-processing factories in [[Mitchelstown]] and Mallow.

The county is known as the "rebel county", a name given to it by King [[Henry VII of England]] for its support, in a futile attempt at a rebellion, of [[Perkin Warbeck]], who claimed to be [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]]. 

==Political subdivisions==
Two [[Local government|local authorities]] have remits which collectively encompass the geographic area of the county and city of Cork. The county, excluding [[Cork city]], is administered by [[Cork County Council]], while the city is administered separately by [[Cork City Council]]. Both city and county are part of the [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Region]]. For [[Eurostat|standardized European statistical purposes]], both Cork County Council and Cork City Council rank equally as first-level local administrative units of the [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|NUTS 3]] [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Region]]. The Republic of Ireland contains thirty-four such [[NUTS of the Republic of Ireland#Local administrative units|LAU 1]] entities.

For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the county is divided into five constituencies—[[Cork East (Dáil constituency)|Cork East]], [[Cork North-Central (Dáil constituency)|Cork North-Central]], [[Cork North-West (Dáil constituency)|Cork North-West]], [[Cork South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Cork South-Central]] and [[Cork South-West (Dáil constituency)|Cork South-West]]. Together they return 18 deputies ([[Teachta Dála|TDs]]) to the Dáil. The county is part of the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South]] constituency for the purposes of [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]].

For purposes other than local government, such as the formation of sporting teams, the term "County Cork" is often taken to include both city and county.

==Geography==
[[Image:Glantane East Wedge Tomb.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Wedge tomb, [[Glantane East]]]]
County Cork is located in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]], bordering [[County Kerry|Kerry]] to the west, [[County Limerick|Limerick]] to the north, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] to the north-east and [[County Waterford|Waterford]] to the east. It is the [[List of Irish counties by area|largest county]] in Ireland by land area, and the largest of Munster's six counties by population and area. At the last census in 2016, Cork city stood at 125,657.<ref name=cso2016City/> The population of the entire county is 542,868<ref name=cso2016City/><ref name=cso2016County/> making it the state's second-[[List of Irish counties by population|most populous]] county and the third-most populous county on the island of Ireland. The remit of Cork County Council includes some suburbs of the city not within the area of Cork City Council.

=== Baronies ===
{{see also|List of baronies of Ireland}}
Twenty-four historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] are in the county—the most of any county in [[List of baronies of Ireland|Ireland]]. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed.

===Civil parishes and townlands===
{{main|List of civil parishes of County Cork}}
{{see also|List of townlands of County Cork}}

The county has 253 civil parishes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Cork&streets=no |title=Placenames Database of Ireland. Retrieved January 21, 2012 |publisher=Logainm.ie |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708105535/http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Cork&streets=no |archive-date=8 July 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Townlands are the smallest officially defined geographical divisions in Ireland, with about 5447 townlands in the county.

===Mountains and upland habitats===
[[File:Beara Way - geograph.org.uk - 263663.jpg|thumb|The Beara pass, through the Slieve Miskish mountains]]
The county's mountain rose during a period [[mountain formation]] some 374-360&nbsp;million years ago and include the [[Slieve Miskish Mountains|Slieve Miskish]] and [[Caha Mountains]] on the [[Beara Peninsula]], the [[Ballyhoura Mountains]] on the border with Limerick and the [[Shehy Mountains]] which contain [[Knockboy]] (706 m), the highest point in Cork. The [[Shehy Mountains]] are on the border with Kerry and may be accessed from the area known as Priests Leap, near the village of Coomhola. The upland areas of the [[Ballyhoura Mountains|Ballyhoura]], [[Boggeragh Mountains|Boggeragh]], [[Derrynasaggart Mountains|Derrynasaggart]], and  [[Mullaghareirk Mountains|Mullaghareirk Mountain]] ranges add to the range of habitats found in the county. Important habitats in the uplands include blanket bog, heath, glacial lakes, and upland grasslands. Cork has the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|13th-highest]] county peak in Ireland.

===Rivers and lakes===
[[File:Loch an Ghleanna Bhig (Glenbeg Lough) - geograph.org.uk - 263779.jpg|thumb|left|[[Glenbeg Lough]], [[Beara Peninsula]]]]
[[File:Three Castle Head Upper Lake 2009 09 10.jpg|thumb|left|Upper lake at Three Castle Head, Mizen Head]]
Three rivers, the [[River Bandon|Bandon]], [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater]], and [[River Lee (Ireland)|Lee]], and their valleys dominate central Cork.{{original research inline|date=July 2017}} Habitats of the valleys and floodplains include woodlands, marshes, fens, and species-rich limestone grasslands. The River Bandon flows through several towns, including [[Dunmanway]] to the west of the town of [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] before draining into Kinsale Harbour on the south coast. Cork's sea loughs include [[Lough Hyne]] and [[Lough Mahon]], and the county also has many small lakes. An area has formed where the River Lee breaks into a network of channels weaving through a series of wooded islands. About 85 hectares of swamp are around Cork's wooded area. The Environmental Protection Agency  carried out a survey of surface waters in County Cork between 1995 and 1997, which identified 125 rivers and 32 lakes covered by the regulations.

===Coastline===
{{See also|List of islands of Ireland}}
Cork has a mountainous and flat landscape with many beaches and sea cliffs along its coast. The southwest of Ireland is known for its peninsulas and some in Cork include the [[Beara Peninsula]], [[Sheep's Head]], [[Mizen Head]], and [[Brow Head]]. Brow Head is the most southerly point of mainland [[Ireland]]. There are many islands off the coast of the county, in particular, off [[West Cork]]. [[Carbery's Hundred Isles]] are the islands around Long Island Bay and Roaringwater Bay.

[[File:Mizen head ireland.png|thumbnail|right|[[Mizen Head]] is the most south-westerly point of both Cork and Ireland.]]
[[Fastnet Rock]] lies in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] 11.3&nbsp;km south of mainland Ireland, making it the most southerly point of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Many notable islands lie off Cork, including [[Bere Island|Bere]], [[Great Island|Great]], [[Sherkin Island|Sherkin]], and [[Cape Clear Island|Cape Clear]]. Cork has 1,094&nbsp;km of coastline, the second-longest coastline of any county after [[County Mayo|Mayo]], which has 1,168&nbsp;km.

===Land and forestry===
Like many parts of Munster, Cork has fertile agricultural land and many bog and peatlands. Cork has around 74,000 hectares of peatlands, which amount to 9.8% of the county's total land area. And the county contains around {{convert|79188|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of forest and woodland area, or 10.5% of Cork's land area, higher than the national average of 9%.

===Wildlife===
The [[hooded crow]], ''Corvus cornix'' is a common bird, particularly in areas nearer the coast. Due to this bird's ability to (rarely) prey upon small lambs, the gun clubs of Cork County have killed many of these birds in modern times.<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009.

The county is colloquially referred to as "The Rebel County", although uniquely Cork does not have an official motto. This name has 15th-century origins, but from the 20th century the name has been more commonly attributed to the prominent role Cork played in the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) when it was the scene of considerable fighting. In addition, it was an anti-treaty stronghold during the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922–23). Much of what is now county Cork was once part of the [[Kingdom of Desmond|Kingdom of ''Deas Mumhan'']] (South [[Munster]]), anglicised as [[Kingdom of Desmond|"Desmond"]], ruled by the [[MacCarthy dynasty|MacCarthy Mór dynasty]]. After the [[Norman Ireland|Norman invasion]] in the 12th century, the McCarthy clan were pushed westward into what is now West Cork and [[County Kerry]]. [[Dunlough Castle]], standing just north of [[Mizen Head]], is one of the oldest castles in Ireland (A.D. 1207). The north and east of Cork were taken by the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[FitzGerald dynasty]], who became the [[Earls of Desmond]]. Cork City was given an English Royal Charter in 1318 and for many centuries was an outpost for [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] culture. The Fitzgerald Desmond dynasty was destroyed in the [[Desmond Rebellions]] of 1569–1573 and 1579–1583. Much of county Cork was devastated in the fighting, particularly in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]]. In the aftermath, much of Cork was colonised by English settlers in the [[Plantation of Munster]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[File:Perkin Warbeck.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Perkin Warbeck]]
In 1491 Cork played a part in the English [[Wars of the Roses]] when [[Perkin Warbeck]], a pretender to the English throne who spread the story that he was really [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York|Richard of Shrewsbury]] (one of the [[Princes in the Tower]]), landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow King [[Henry VII of England]]. The Cork people supported Warbeck because he was Flemish and not English; Cork was the only county in Ireland to join the fight. The mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England, but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. Cork's nickname of the 'rebel county' (and Cork city's of the 'rebel city') originates in these events.<ref>{{cite web |title=If not for collins, why is it called the rebel county? |url=https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/if-not-for-collins-why-is-it-called-the-rebel-county-29469436.html |access-date=2020-06-28 |work=[[Irish Independent]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=O'Shea |first=Joe |date=2019-05-21 |title=Why is Cork called the Rebel County? |url=https://www.corkbeo.ie/news/history/real-reason-cork-called-rebel-16323863 |access-date=2020-06-28 |website=Cork Beo}}</ref>

In 1601 the decisive [[Siege of Kinsale|Battle of Kinsale]] took place in County Cork, which was to lead to English domination of Ireland for centuries. [[Kinsale]] had been the scene of a landing of Spanish troops to help Irish rebels in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594–1603). When this force was defeated, the rebel hopes for victory in the war were all but ended. County Cork was officially created by a division of the older [[Kingdom of Desmond|County Desmond]] in 1606.

[[File:Michael Collins.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], photographed in 1919]]
In the 19th century, Cork was a centre for the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|Fenians]] and for the constitutional [[Irish nationalism|nationalism]] of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], from 1910 that of the [[All-for-Ireland League|All-for-Ireland Party]]. The county was a hotbed of guerrilla activity during the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921). Three Cork Brigades of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] operated in the county and another in the city. Prominent actions included the [[Kilmichael Ambush]] in November 1920 and the [[Crossbarry Ambush]] in March 1921. The activity of IRA [[flying column]]s, such as the one under [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] in west Cork, was popularised in the [[Ken Loach]] film ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes The Barley]]''. On 11 December 1920, [[The Burning of Cork|Cork City centre was gutted by fires]] started by the [[Black and Tans]] in reprisal for IRA attacks. Over 300 buildings were destroyed; many other towns and villages around the county, including [[Fermoy]], suffered a similar fate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rebelcork.com/ |title=Rebelcork.com |publisher=Rebelcork.com |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402070746/http://www.rebelcork.com/ |archive-date=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

During the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922–23), most of the IRA units in Cork sided against the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. From July to August 1922 they held the city and county as part of the so-called [[Munster Republic]]. However, Cork was taken by troops of the [[Irish Free State]] in August 1922 in the [[Irish Free State offensive]], that included both overland and seaborne attacks. For the remainder of the war, the county saw sporadic guerrilla fighting until the Anti-Treaty side called a ceasefire and dumped their arms in May 1923. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], a key figure in the War of Independence, was born near [[Clonakilty]] and assassinated during the civil war in [[Béal na Bláth]], both in west Cork.

==Irish language==
County Cork has two [[Gaeltacht]] areas where the [[Irish language]] is the primary medium of everyday speech. These are {{lang|ga|Múscraí}} ([[Muskerry]]) in the north of the county, especially the villages of {{lang|ga|Cill Na Martra}} ([[Kilnamartyra]]), {{lang|ga|Baile Bhúirne}} ([[Ballyvourney]]), {{lang|ga|Cúil Aodha}} ([[Coolea]]), {{lang|ga|Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh}} ([[Ballingeary]]), and {{lang|ga|Oileán Chléire}} ([[Cape Clear Island]]).

There are 14,829 Irish language speakers in County Cork, with 3,660 native speakers in the Cork Gaeltacht. In addition, in 2011 there were 6,273 pupils attending the 21 [[Gaelscoil]]eanna and six [[Gaelcholáiste|Gaelcholáistí]] all across the county.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/assets/Staitistic%C3%AD-2010-2011_Gaeilge.pdf |title=Oideachas Trí Mheán na Gaeilge in Éirinn sa Ghalltacht 2010–2011 |year=2011 |publisher=gaelscoileanna.ie |language=Irish |accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref> According to the Irish Census 2006, there are 4,896 people in the county who identify themselves as being daily Irish speakers outside of the education system. Ballingeary is a centre for Irish language tuition, with a summer school, Coláiste na Mumhan, or the College of Munster.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
