The '''Museum of Fine Arts''' (often abbreviated as '''MFA Boston''' or '''MFA''') in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], is the [[list of largest art museums|14th largest]] art museum in the world, measured by public gallery area. It contains more than 450,000 works of art, making it one of the most comprehensive collections in the Americas. It is home to 8,161 paintings, surpassed among American museums only by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City. With more than 1.2 million visitors a year,<ref>{{cite web|title=Museum of Fine Arts Annual Report|url=http://www.mfa.org/annual-report-2015/numbers.html|website=Museum of Fine Arts|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref> it is the 52nd [[List of most visited art museums|most visited art museum in the world]] {{as of|2019|lc=y}}.

Founded in 1870 in Copley Square, the museum moved to its current Fenway location in 1909. The museum is affiliated with the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts]].

==History==

===1870–1907===
[[File:MuseumOfFineArtsBoston CopleySquare 19thc.jpg|left|thumb|The original Museum of Fine Arts building in Copley Square.]]
The Museum of Fine Arts was founded in 1870 and was initially located on the top floor of the [[Boston Athenaeum]] and most of its initial collection came from the Athenæum's Art Gallery.<ref name=bostonaia /> [[Francis Davis Millet]], a local artist, was instrumental in starting the Art School affiliated with the museum, and in appointing [[Emil Otto Grundmann]] as its first director.<ref>{{cite web|author=Natasha |url=http://jssgallery.org/Other_Artists/Millet_Francis_D/Francis_D_Millet.htm |title=John Singer Sargent Virtual Gallery |publisher=Jssgallery.org |date=|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref> In 1876, the museum moved to a highly ornamented brick [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] building designed by [[John Hubbard Sturgis]] and [[Charles Brigham]], noted for its massed architectural [[terracotta]]. It was located in [[Copley Square]] at Dartmouth and St. James Streets.<ref name=bostonaia /> It was built almost entirely of brick and terracotta, which was imported from England, with some stone about its base.<ref>{{cite journal|title=An announcement was made...|journal=The Brickbuilder|date=December 1899|volume=8|issue=12|page=237|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015084516791;view=1up;seq=445|accessdate=7 March 2015|publisher=Rodgers & Manson|location=Boston, MA|format=hathitrust.org}}</ref>
After the MFA moved out in 1907, this original building was demolished, and the Copley Plaza Hotel (now the [[Fairmont Copley Plaza]]) replaced it in 1912.<ref>{{cite web |title=Preserving History Chronicles The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Since Its Founding in 1870 |url=https://artdaily.cc/news/24791/Preserving-History-Chronicles-The-Museum-of-Fine-Arts--Boston--Since-Its-Founding-in-1870#.XlgSfi2ZPao |website=artdaily.cc |publisher=Royalville Communications, Inc |accessdate=2020-02-27}}</ref>

===1907–2008===
In 1907, plans were laid to build a new home for the museum on [[Huntington Avenue]] in Boston's [[Fenway-Kenmore]] neighborhood, near the recently opened [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]]. Museum trustees hired architect [[Guy Lowell]] to create a design for a museum that could be built in stages, as funding was obtained for each phase. Two years later, the first section of Lowell's [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] design was completed. It featured a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} [[façade]] of [[granite]] and a grand [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]. The museum moved to its new location later in 1909.

The second phase of construction built a wing along [[The Fens (Boston, Massachusetts)|The Fens]] to house paintings galleries. It was funded entirely by Maria Antoinette Evans Hunt, the wife of wealthy [[business magnate]] Robert Dawson Evans, and opened in 1915. From 1916 through 1925, the noted artist [[John Singer Sargent]] painted the [[fresco]]es that adorn the rotunda and the associated [[colonnades]].

The Decorative Arts Wing was built in 1928, and expanded in 1968. An addition designed by [[Hugh Stubbins]] and Associates was built in 1966–1970, and another expansion by [[The Architects Collaborative]] opened in 1976. The West Wing, now the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art, was designed by [[I. M. Pei]] and opened in 1981. This wing now houses the museum's cafe, restaurant, meeting rooms, classrooms, and a giftshop/bookstore, as well as large exhibition spaces.

===2008–present===
In the mid-2000s, the museum launched a major effort to renovate and expand its facilities. In a seven-year fundraising campaign between 2001 and 2008 for a new wing, the [[financial endowment|endowment]], and operating expenses, the museum managed to receive over $500 million, in addition to acquiring over $160 million worth of art.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith H.|title=Boston Museum Grows by Casting a Wide Net|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/giving/11BOSTON.html|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=The New York Times|date=10 November 2010}}</ref> 

During the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis|global financial crisis]] between 2007 and 2012, the museum's annual budget was trimmed by $1.5 million. The museum increased revenues by organizing traveling exhibitions, which included a loan exhibition sent to the for-profit [[Bellagio (resort)|Bellagio]] in Las Vegas in exchange for $1 million. In 2011, [[Moody's Investors Service]] calculated that the museum had over $180 million in outstanding debt. However, the agency cited growing attendance, a large endowment, and positive cash flow as reasons to believe that the museum's finances would become stable in the near future.

In 2011, the museum put eight paintings by Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Gauguin, and others on sale at [[Sotheby's]], bringing in a total of $21.6 million, to pay for ''[[Man at His Bath]]'' by [[Gustave Caillebotte]] at a cost reported to be more than $15 million.<ref>Judith H. Dobrzynski (March 14, 2012), "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/arts/artsspecial/a-fund-for-buying-art-burnishes-collections-and-reputations.html How an Acquisition Fund Burnishes Reputations]". ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>

On March 12, 2020, the museum announced that it would close indefinitely due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. All public events and programs are canceled until August 31, 2020. No date for reopening has yet been decided. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcvb.com/article/museum-of-fine-arts-in-boston-cancels-public-events-programs-through-end-of-august-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic/31998406#|title=Museum of Fine Arts in Boston cancels public events, programs through the end of August due to Coronavirus pandemic|publisher=WCVB|date=March 31, 2020}}</ref>

====Art of the Americas Wing====
The renovation included a new Art of the Americas Wing to feature artwork from North, South, and Central America. In 2006, the groundbreaking ceremonies took place. The new wing and adjoining Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Family Courtyard (a bright, cavernous interior space) were designed in a restrained, contemporary style by the London-based architectural firm [[Foster and Partners]], under the directorship of Thomas T. Difraia and [[Childs Bertman Tseckares Inc.|CBT/Childs Bertman Tseckares Architects]]. The landscape architecture firm [[Kathryn Gustafson#Gustafson Guthrie Nichol|Gustafson Guthrie Nichol]] redesigned the Huntington Avenue and Fenway entrances, gardens, access roads, and interior courtyards.

The wing opened on November 20, 2010 with free admission to the public. Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] declared it "Museum of Fine Arts Day", and more than 13,500 visitors attended the opening. The {{convert|12,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} glass-enclosed courtyard now features a {{convert|42.5|ft|adj=on}} high glass sculpture, titled the ''[[Lime Green Icicle Tower]]'', by [[Dale Chihuly]].<ref name=lime>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/lime-green-icicle-tower-551953 |title=Lime Green Icicle Tower |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}</ref> In 2014, the Art of the Americas Wing was recognized for its high architectural achievement by the award of the [[Harleston Parker Medal]], by the [[Boston Society of Architects]].

In 2015, the museum renovated its outdoors [[Japanese garden]], Tenshin-en. The garden, which originally opened in 1988, had been designed by Japanese professor Kinsaku Nakane. The garden's ''kabukimon''-style entrance gate was built by Chris Hall of Massachusetts, using traditional [[Japanese carpentry]] techniques.<ref>{{cite web|title=Japanese Garden, Tenshin-en|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/featured-galleries/japanese-garden-tenshin-en|website=Boston Museum of Fine Arts|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=2015-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.woodworkersjournal.com/chris-hall/|last1=Takes|first1=Joanna Werch|title=Chris Hall: A (Japanese-Inspired) Timber Framing Philosophy for Furniture|journal=Woodworker's Journal|date=January 20, 2015|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>

=== Japanese Art ===
The collection of Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts is the largest in the world outside of Japan. Anne Nishimura Morse, the William and Helen Pounds Senior Curator of Japanese Art oversees 100,000 total items<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2012-08-17|title=Spotlight on panelist Dr. Anne Nishimura Morse, curator of Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|url=https://culcon.jusfc.gov/spotlight-on-panelist-dr-anne-nishimura-morse-curator-of-japanese-art-at-the-museum-of-fine-artsboston/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2020-07-07|work=Conference on Cultural and Educational Interchange (CULCON)}}</ref> that include 4,000 Japanese paintings, 5,000 ceramic pieces, and over 30,000 [[ukiyo-e]] prints.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Art of Japan Collection and History of Cultural Exchange|url=https://www.mfa.org/news/japan|accessdate=2020-07-08|work=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Museum of Fine Arts Boston: Japanese Collections|url=https://guides.nccjapan.org/c.php?g=355937&p=2398640|accessdate=2020-07-08|work=North American Coordinating Council on Japanese Library Resources}}</ref>

The base of this collection was assembled in the late 19th century through the efforts of four men, [[Ernest Fenollosa]], [[Okakura Kakuzō|Kakuzo Okakura]], [[William Sturgis Bigelow]], and [[Edward S. Morse|Edward Sylvester Morse]], each of whom had spent time in Japan and admired Japanese art.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Adamson|first=Glenn|date=2020-06-13|title=The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston turns 150|url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/museum-of-fine-arts-boston-150th-anniversary/|accessdate=2020-07-07|work=Apollo Magazine}}</ref> Their combined donations account for up to 75 percent of the current collection.<ref name=":0" /> In 1890, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston became the first museum in the United States to establish a collection and appoint a curator specifically for Japanese art.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Khvan|first=Olga|date=2015-04-03|title=Two New Exhibits Tell Story of Japanese Art at MFA Boston|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2015/04/03/japanese-art-mfa-boston/|accessdate=2020-07-08|work=Boston Magazine}}</ref>

Another notable part of this collection is a number of [[Buddhist art in Japan|Buddhist statues]]. In the later [[Meiji (era)|Meiji Era]] of Japan, around the turn of the 20th century, government policy deemphasizing [[Buddhism]] in favor of [[State Shinto|Shintoism]] and financial pressures on temples resulted in a number of Buddhist statues being sold to private collectors.

Also important for this collection is the exhibition of its items in Japan. From 1999 to 2018, regular exchange of items was conducted between the Museum of Fine Arts and its sister museum, the now-closed [[Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts]].<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite news|title='In Pursuit of Happiness: Favorite Works from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston' {{!}} The Japan Times|language=en-US|work=The Japan Times|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2018/07/17/arts/openings-outside-tokyo/pursuit-happiness-favorite-works-museum-fine-arts-boston/|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref> In 2012, the traveling exhibition ''Japanese Masterpieces from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston'' visited the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka, and was well received.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Japanese Masterpieces from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|url=https://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_free_page/index.php?id=1416&lang=en|accessdate=2020-07-08|work=Tokyo National Museum}}</ref>

The MFA has gradually been expanding its programs of community outreach to people who have not been traditional visitors, and this trend accelerated after [[Matthew Teitelbaum]] was appointed as Director in 2015. This expansion has included improved accessibility for visitors who may be visually, audibly, or physically impaired.<ref name="Access">{{cite web |title=Accessibility |url=https://www.mfa.org/visit/accessibility |website=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston |accessdate=2020-02-19 |language=en}}</ref> Special programming and tours are available for blind, [[ASL]]-fluent, cognitively-impaired, [[autism|autistic]], and medically-assisted guests.<ref>{{cite web |title=Access Programs |url=https://www.mfa.org/visit/accessibility/programs |website=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston |accessdate=2020-02-19 |language=en}}</ref> In addition, the MFA has welcomed [[LGBTQ]] visitors with exhibitions like ''Gender Bending Fashion'' (2019), and in Spring 2019 it installed universally welcoming signage for [[restroom]]s.<ref name="VisTips">{{cite web |title=Tips for Visitors |url=https://www.mfa.org/visit/plan-your-visit/tips-visitors |website=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston |accessdate=2020-02-19 |language=en}}</ref>

A museum spokesperson said that the warning was actually "no water bottles", but conceded that there was no way of definitively proving what was actually said. Regardless, all museum staff dealing with school groups were to be retrained in interactions with their guests.
