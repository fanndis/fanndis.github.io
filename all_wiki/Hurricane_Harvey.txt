==Meteorological history==
{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Harvey}}
{{Storm path|Harvey 2017 track.png|left|300px}}
Hurricane Harvey originated from a westward-moving [[tropical wave]] that emerged from Africa over the eastern Atlantic Ocean, on August&nbsp;12. A surface circulation slowly developed and [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] consolidated around the low over the subsequent days; the system became a [[tropical depression]] on August&nbsp;17, roughly 505&nbsp;mi (815&nbsp;km) east of [[Barbados]].<ref name="Tropical Storm HARVEY"/> Maintaining its brisk westward motion, the system strengthened slightly and became a tropical storm later that day, at which time it was [[Tropical cyclone naming|assigned the name]] ''Harvey''. With [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h), Harvey made [[landfall]]s in Barbados and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent]] on August&nbsp;18 before entering the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Hostile environmental conditions, namely [[wind shear]], imparted weakening and caused Harvey to degenerate into a tropical wave by August&nbsp;19.<ref name="Remnants of HARVEY"/> Though it lacked an organized surface low, the remnants of Harvey continued to produce significant convection as it traversed the Caribbean Sea and [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. The system reached the [[Bay of Campeche]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on August&nbsp;23 and soon consolidated around a new surface low.<ref name="TCR">{{cite report|author1=Eric S. Blake|author2=David A. Zelinsky|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=January 23, 2018|accessdate=January 29, 2018|title=Hurricane Harvey (AL092017)|series=Tropical Cyclone Report|url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL092017_Harvey.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126083538/https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL092017_Harvey.pdf|archivedate=January 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Late on August&nbsp;23, the remnants of Harvey regenerated into a tropical cyclone and reattained tropical storm intensity by 18:00&nbsp;UTC.<ref name="Tropical Depression HARVEY"/> Initial reorganization was slow; however, within a highly favorable environment, the system soon underwent [[rapid intensification]] as an [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] developed and its [[Atmospheric pressure|central pressure]] quickly fell. After becoming a hurricane on August&nbsp;24, Harvey continued to quickly strengthen over the next day, ultimately reaching peak intensity as a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane.<ref name="Hurricane HARVEY"/> Around 03:00&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;26, the hurricane made landfall at peak intensity on [[San Jose Island, Texas|San Jose Island]], just east of [[Rockport, Texas|Rockport]], with winds of 130&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h) and an [[atmospheric pressure]] of {{convert|937|mbar|inHg|lk=on|abbr=on}}. It made a second landfall on the Texas mainland, at Rockport, three hours later in a slightly weakened state. Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]].<ref name="TCR"/>

After striking land, Harvey rapidly weakened as its speed slowed dramatically to a crawl, and Harvey weakened to a tropical storm on August&nbsp;26. For about two days the storm stalled just inland, dropping very heavy rainfall and causing widespread flash flooding. Harvey's center drifted back towards the southeast, ultimately re-emerging into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on August&nbsp;28. Once offshore, the poorly organized system struggled against strong wind shear. Deep convection persisted north of the cyclone's center near the [[Houston metropolitan area]] along a [[stationary front]], resulting in several days of record-breaking rain. Early on August&nbsp;30, the former hurricane made its fifth and final landfall just west of [[Cameron, Louisiana]] with winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h). Associated convection with Harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on September&nbsp;1 as it moved further inland, indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 06:00&nbsp;UTC that day. The remnants continued northeastwards before being absorbed into another extratropical system on September&nbsp;3.<ref name="TCR"/>

Winds left residents throughout [[Barbados]] without electricity, with a majority of outages occurring in [[Christ Church, Barbados|Christ Church]], [[Saint Joseph, Barbados|Saint Joseph]], [[Saint Lucy, Barbados|Saint Lucy]], and [[Saint Michael, Barbados|Saint Michael]] provinces. Flooding washed one house off its foundation, while water entered some houses, forcing some people to evacuate. Bridges in [[Saint Andrew, Barbados|Saint Andrew]] and Saint Joseph were damaged. Additionally, a fuel depot in [[Speightstown]] was flooded. Winds from Harvey ripped the roof off a church.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/barbados/cdema-situation-report-1-tropical-storm-harvey-400pm-august-18th-2017|title=CDEMA Situation Report #1 – Tropical Storm Harvey – as of 4:00pm on August 18th, 2017|date=August 18, 2017|work=[[Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency]]|publisher=[[ReliefWeb]]|location=[[New York City]]|accessdate=August 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825062929/http://reliefweb.int/report/barbados/cdema-situation-report-1-tropical-storm-harvey-400pm-august-18th-2017|archivedate=August 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], nine homes were flooded and four others experienced wind damage.

Strong winds and heavy rainfall also affected [[Suriname]] and [[Guyana]]. In the former, high winds in the capital city of [[Paramaribo]] caused roof damage to the [[Presidential Palace of Suriname|Presidential Palace]] and two homes, while the Torarica Hotel and Casino suffered structural impact. Additionally, four dwellings were deroofed in [[Commewijne District|Commewijne]] and three others lost their roofs in [[Wanica District|Wanica]]; in the latter, the Ministry of Social Affairs building was damaged by falling trees. In Guyana, the village of Jawalla bore the brunt of the storm. Four homes were demolished, while five other residences and two shops were damaged. Several public buildings were also damaged, including the community center, the village council buildings, the nursery, and public schools.

==Impacts in the United States==
[[File:Harvey 2017-08-26 0425Z.jpg|thumb|Satellite picture of Harvey making landfall in [[Texas]] on August 26]]
The widespread and catastrophic effects of Hurricane Harvey resulted in one of the costliest natural disasters in United States history. An estimated 300,000&nbsp;structures and 500,000&nbsp;vehicles were damaged or destroyed in Texas alone. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] estimated total damage at $125&nbsp;billion, with a 90% confidence interval of $90–160&nbsp;billion. The scope of flooding in areas with low [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP) participation lends to the large uncertainty in the damage total. This ranks Harvey as the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the country alongside [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. However, accounting for inflation and cost increases since 2005, the National Hurricane Center considers Harvey the second-costliest.<ref name="TCR"/> Nationwide, 107&nbsp;people died in storm-related incidents: 103 in Texas, 2 in Arkansas, 1 in Tennessee, and 1 in Kentucky. Of the deaths in Texas, 68 were from the direct effects of Harvey, the highest such number in the state since 1919.<ref name="TCR"/>

On September 1, the outer bands of Harvey's remnants passed through [[North Carolina]]. Severe weather was reported across the central part of the state. Tornadoes touched down in Angier, Clayton, and Smithfield, high wind knocked out power in Fuquay-Varina, Sanford, and Holly Springs, and large hail hit parts of Wake, Harnett, and Johnston counties. In Willow Spring, hail larger than softballs damaged homes and cars. [[Flash flood]]ing hit Greenville further east.

===Energy production===
{{see also|2017 Arkema plant explosion}}
Energy production in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] declined in the wake of Harvey by approximately 21% — the output dropped to 378,633 barrels per day from the original 1.75 million [[Barrel of oil|barrels of oil]] produced each day. The [[Eagle Ford Group|Eagle Ford Rock Formation]] (shale oil and gas) in southern Texas reduced production by 300,000 to 500,000 <abbr title="barrels per day">bpd</abbr>, according to the [[Texas Railroad Commission]]. Many energy-related ports and terminals closed, delaying about fourteen crude oil tankers. About 2.25 million bpd of refining capacity was<!--is?--> offline for several days; that is about 12% of total US capacity, with refineries affected at Corpus Christi, and later [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] and [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], and [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]].

==Environmental factors==
[[File:Large Houston Landsat.jpg|thumb|Houston's very flat topography makes flooding a problem. (Simulated-color image)]]

Houston is located in the [[Southeastern United States|southeastern]] United States on the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]], and its [[clay]]-based soils provide poor drainage. The [[climate of Houston]] brings very heavy rainfall annually in between April to October, during the Texas Gulf Coast [[rainy season]], together with tidal flood events, which have produced repeated floods in the city ever since its founding in 1836, though the flood control district founded in 1947, aided by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], managed to prevent statewide flooding for over fifty years. More recently, residents died in "historic flooding" in [[2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak|May 2015]], and in the [[April 2016 North American storm complex|April 2016 "tax day floods"]].<ref name="Gabbatt 2808">{{cite web | author=Adam Gabbatt | title=What makes Houston so vulnerable to serious floods? | website=the Guardian | date=August 28, 2017 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/28/houston-harvey-risk-floods-analysis | access-date=August 30, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830012120/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/28/houston-harvey-risk-floods-analysis | archive-date=August 30, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Fox 29082017">{{cite web | author=Justin Fox | title=How to Make 500-Year Storms Happen Every Year | publisher=Bloomberg.com | date=August 29, 2017 | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-29/how-to-make-500-year-storms-happen-every-year | access-date=August 30, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830013602/https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-29/how-to-make-500-year-storms-happen-every-year | archive-date=August 30, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> There is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region, allowing them to produce tremendous amounts of rain over an extended period, as occurred during [[Tropical Storm Claudette (1979)|Tropical Storm Claudette]] in 1979, and [[Tropical Storm Allison]] in 2001.<ref name="NPR.org 28 8 2017">{{cite web | title=How A Warmer Climate Helped Shape Harvey | website=NPR.org | date=August 28, 2017 | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546748502/how-a-warmer-climate-helped-shape-harvey | access-date=August 30, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830014302/http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546748502/how-a-warmer-climate-helped-shape-harvey | archive-date=August 30, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient, slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea.

Houston has seen rapid urban development ([[urban sprawl]]), with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water, overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels.<ref name="Fernandez Fausset 2017">{{cite web | author1=Manny Fernandez | author2=Richard Fausset | title=A Storm Forces Houston, the Limitless City, to Consider Its Limits | website=The New York Times | date=August 27, 2017 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/houston-flooding-growth-regulation.html | access-date=August 31, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831025002/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/houston-flooding-growth-regulation.html | archive-date=August 31, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> Between 1992 and 2010, almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost, decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://qz.com/1064364/hurricane-harvey-houstons-flooding-made-worse-by-unchecked-urban-development-and-wetland-destruction/ | first1=Ana | last1=Campoy | first2=David | last2=Yanofsky | title=Houston's flooding shows what happens when you ignore science and let developers run rampant | date=August 29, 2017 | accessdate=September 12, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912080708/https://qz.com/1064364/hurricane-harvey-houstons-flooding-made-worse-by-unchecked-urban-development-and-wetland-destruction/ | archive-date=September 12, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> However, Harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the area.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/8/30/houston-hurricane-harvey-land-use | first1=Daniel | last1=Herriges | title=Houston isn't flooded because of its land use planning | date=August 30, 2017 | accessdate=September 12, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912234548/https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/8/30/houston-hurricane-harvey-land-use | archive-date=September 12, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The Katy Prairie in western Harris County, which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region, has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to [[Urban sprawl|suburban development]], and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100-year floodplain in Harris County since 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/metropolis/2017/08/houston_wasn_t_built_to_withstand_a_storm_like_harvey.html |title=Houston Wasn't Built for a Storm Like This |author=Henry Grabar |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=August 27, 2017 |accessdate=August 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829025120/http://www.slate.com/articles/business/metropolis/2017/08/houston_wasn_t_built_to_withstand_a_storm_like_harvey.html |archive-date=August 29, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Subsidence===
As Houston has expanded, rainwater infiltration in the region has lessened and [[aquifer]] extraction increased, causing the depletion of underground aquifers. When the saturated ground dries, the soil can be compressed and the land surface elevation decreases in a process called [[subsidence]]. Subsidence can also occur due to sediment settling. Specifically, regions to the north and west of the Houston metro have seen {{convert|10|mm|in}} to {{convert|25|mm|in}} of subsidence per year.<ref name="Jiangbo Yu et al">{{cite journal|author = Jiangbo Yu|display-authors=etal|title=Is There Deep-Seated Subsidence in the Houston-Galveston Area?|journal=International Journal of Geophysics|volume=2014|pages=1–11|date=July 2, 2014|doi=10.1155/2014/942834|doi-access=free}}</ref> While oil extraction can cause subsidence, in the Houston-Galveston area, most oil has been extracted from sandstone that has relatively negligible ability to compress once oil has been removed. Thus, oil extraction has not resulted in significant subsidence.<ref name="Jiangbo Yu et al"/> Further, the volume of oil extraction in the Houston area is too low to cause significant subsidence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oil Wells and Production in Harris County, TX|url=http://www.texas-drilling.com/harris-county|accessdate=December 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215111431/http://www.texas-drilling.com/harris-county|archive-date=December 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Climate change===

The [[Gulf of Mexico]] is known for hurricanes in August, so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to [[global warming]], but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms. Studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall.<ref name="Wapo Aug27" /> Weather events are due to multiple factors, and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition, but climate change affects aspects of extreme events, and very likely worsened some of the impacts of Harvey.<ref name="PIK Research Portal 31 Aug">{{cite web | author=Stefan Rahmstorf | authorlink=Stefan Rahmstorf | title=Storm Harvey: impacts likely worsened due to global warming | website=[[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] Research Portal | url=https://www.pik-potsdam.de/news/in-short/storm-harvey-impacts-worsened-due-to-global-warming | access-date=August 31, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831070041/https://www.pik-potsdam.de/news/in-short/storm-harvey-impacts-worsened-due-to-global-warming | archive-date=August 31, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> In a briefing, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] stated that the quantity of rainfall from Harvey had very likely been increased by climate change.<ref name="Miles Aug 29 2017">{{cite web | author=Tom Miles | title=Storm Harvey's rainfall likely linked to climate change: U.N. | publisher=Reuters U.K. | date=August 29, 2017 | url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-storm-harvey-un-idUKKCN1B919O | access-date=August 31, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831072346/https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-storm-harvey-un-idUKKCN1B919O | archive-date=August 31, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Harvey approached Houston over sea-surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures. Warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes, and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger, more intense and longer lasting, in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall.<ref name="Atlantic2717">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/did-climate-change-intensify-hurricane-harvey/538158|date=August 27, 2017|work=The Atlantic|title=Did Climate Change Intensify Hurricane Harvey?|access-date=August 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828193702/https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/did-climate-change-intensify-hurricane-harvey/538158/|archive-date=August 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Wapo Aug27">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/08/25/what-you-can-and-cant-say-about-climate-change-and-hurricane-harvey|title=What you can and can't say about climate change and Hurricane Harvey|date=August 27, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=August 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830230225/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/08/25/what-you-can-and-cant-say-about-climate-change-and-hurricane-harvey/|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Sea level rise]] added to the resulting problems.<ref name="PIK Research Portal 31 Aug" /> According to officials from the Harris County Flood Control District, Harvey caused the third '500-year' flood in three years.<ref name="Wapo30Aug3rd500Event">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/29/houston-is-experiencing-its-third-500-year-flood-in-3-years-how-is-that-possible|title=Houston is experiencing its third '500-year' flood in 3 years.

Warmer air can hold more water vapor, in accordance with the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]], and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records.<ref name="PIK Research Portal 31 Aug" /> Regional [[sea surface temperature]]s around Houston have risen around 0.5&nbsp;°C (0.9&nbsp;°F) in recent decades, which caused a 3–5% increase in moisture in the atmosphere.

The slow movement of Harvey over Texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state, as has also happened with earlier storms.<ref name="NPR.org 28 8 2017" /> Harvey's stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the US at the time, which had pushed the jet stream to the north.
