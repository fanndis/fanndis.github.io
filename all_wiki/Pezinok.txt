'''Pezinok''' ({{IPA-sk|ˈpɛzinɔk}}; {{lang-hu|Bazin}}; {{lang-de|Bösing}}; {{lang-lat|Bazinium}}) is a town in southwestern [[Slovakia]]. It is roughly {{convert|20|km|2|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Bratislava]] and, as of December 2018, had a population of 23,002.

Pezinok lies near the [[Little Carpathians]] and thrives mainly on viticulture and agriculture, as well as on brick making and ceramic(s) production.

==History==

From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Pezinok, or at least its surroundings, was for the first time mentioned in 1208 under name "''terra Bozin''". During the next few centuries, the town changed from a mining settlement to a vineyard town. It gained status of a free royal town on 14 June 1647. Pezinok had its most glorious era of wealth and prosperity in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was also one of the richest towns in the Kingdom of Hungary. Its wealth was based on production of quality wines. In the 19th century, the town slowly began to industrialize: the first [[sulphuric acid]] factory in Hungary or the known brick works were established here. It boomed further after it was connected to railway. After the break-up of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918/1920, the town became part of newly created [[Czechoslovakia]]. In the first half of the 20th century, it was declining, the vineyard production was declining, forcing many inhabitants to emigrate. It is growing again after the end of [[World War II]]. The town was [[Ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]] as its German-speaking minority was [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expelled]].

==Geography and tourism==
Pezinok lies at an altitude of {{convert|152|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] and covers an area of {{convert|72.555|km2|sqmi|1}}.<ref name="statistics"/> It is located in the [[Danubian Lowland]] at the foothills of the [[Little Carpathians]], around {{convert|20|km|2|abbr=on}} north-east of Bratislava. Another major city, [[Trnava]], is located around {{convert|25|km|2|abbr=on}} to the east.

A ski resort is situated on the ''Baba'' mountain. The neighboring Little Carpathians offer numerous [[hiking]] paths. All of the city forests are part of the [[Little Carpathians Protected Landscape Area]]. Some people might argue that one of the most interesting wild life appearances in the Protected Area, is Tomas Rolko <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0&ab_channel=cotter548</ref>

The Little Carpathians Museum (Malokarpatské múzeum), which is in a typical wine merchant's house in the centre of the town, was undergoing a major renovation in 2008 and promises to be one of the best small museums in Slovakia.

It has the biggest collection of wine presses in central Europe, some of them gigantic wooden affairs dating from the early seventeenth century; the atmospheric old cellars of the building are partly given over to an exhibition of them.

But Martin Hrubala, the deputy director of the museum, is keen to make the museum not just about the old but also the new: the entrance fee includes a [[wine tasting]], accompanied by a sommelier. And the museum promises interactivity at a level unusual for Slovak museums. Visitors, for instance, as well as tasting wine will also get the opportunity to make their own.

Pezinok seems to have been investing heavily in public facilities lately: the city museum, in a building opposite the Little Carpathians Museum, opened in 2003. It features a range of attractively presented local archaeological finds and a selection of stonework salvaged from nearby churches; labelling, however, is in Slovak only.

And at the northern end of the city centre, next to a park which once formed its landscaped grounds, is Pezinok Castle. Originally a moated fortress which was later turned into a chateau for the aristocratic Pálffy family, the cellars of the castle are now home to the National Wine Salon.

[[Little Carpathians Museum]] (''Malokarpatské múzeum'') is situated in Pezinok.
