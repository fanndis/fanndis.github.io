"'''Cardigan'''" (stylized in [[all lowercase]]) is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] and the second track on her eighth studio album, ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'' (2020), released on July 24, 2020 through [[Republic Records]]. It impacted radio stations on July 27, 2020 as the album's lead single. Swift co-wrote the song with its producer [[Aaron Dessner]]. "Cardigan" is a slow-burning [[Folk music|folk]], [[soft rock]] and [[Indie rock|indie-rock]] [[ballad]] with stripped-down instrumentals of tender [[piano]], clopping [[Drum machine|drums]] and melancholic [[violin]]s. Lyrically, it sees Swift singing about a comforting romance lost in memories, from the perspective of a woman named Betty, one of the many fictitious characters narrated in ''Folklore''.

The song received critical acclaim, with praise towards the poetic songwriting and laid-back sound. At the [[63rd Grammy Awards]], "Cardigan" is nominated for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Best Pop Solo Performance]]. Upon release, the song debuted at number one on the global [[Spotify]] songs chart, receiving over 7.742&nbsp;million streams, garnering the biggest opening-day for a song by a female artist in 2020. An accompanying [[music video]] for the song—written, directed, and styled by Swift—was released alongside album launch. The dreamy video presented a [[cottagecore]] aesthetic and features Swift in three different settings: a cozy [[Cottage|cabin]] in the woods, a magical [[moss]]-covered forest and a dark stormy sea, representing different phases of a relationship. An acoustic version of the song, entitled "Cabin in Candlelight", was released on July 30, 2020.

With the song's debut at the number-one spot of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], it became Swift's sixth number-one single in the United States. Along with ''Folklore'' debuting at number-one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] the same week, Swift became the first artist ever to debut atop the Hot 100 and ''Billboard'' 200 simultaneously. The song further topped ''Billboard'' [[Hot Alternative Songs]], [[Hot Rock & Alternative Songs]], [[Streaming Songs]] and [[Digital Songs|Digital Song Sales]] charts, making Swift the first act in history to garner twenty chart-toppers on the latter. "Cardigan" also debuted at number one in Australia, in the top-5 in Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Panama and Singapore, top-10 in Guatemala and the United Kingdom and the top-20 in Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania and Scotland.

In the song, Swift sings from the perspective of a fictional character named Betty, who recalls the separation and enduring optimism of a relationship with someone named James. Swift also mentions [[Peter Pan]] and the [[High Line]] in the song, and uses a [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] as a [[metaphor]] for a "lingering physical memento" of the relationship.<ref name="Carson">{{cite web|last=Carsom|first=Sarah|date=July 24, 2020|title=Taylor Swift, Folklore, review: a dazzling, timeless surprise album|url=https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review-dazzling-timeless-surprise-new-eighth-album-folk-cardigan-lyrics-561733|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724041853/https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review-dazzling-timeless-surprise-new-eighth-album-folk-cardigan-lyrics-561733|archive-date=July 24, 2020|accessdate=July 24, 2020|work=[[i (newspaper)|i]]}}</ref><ref name=":10" /> While promoting the limited edition version of the single, Swift told fans on her [[Instagram#Instagram Stories|Instagram Story]] that she sent the original songwriting voice memo to Aaron Dessner on April 27, 2020 after hearing the instrumental tracks he created.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=July 28, 2020|title=Taylor Swift Still Has More 'Folklore' Tricks Up Her Knitted Sleeve|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9425493/taylor-swift-preps-cardigan-single-with-extras|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 28, 2020|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> Dessner said "Cardigan" was the first song written in their collaboration,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/aaron-dessner-taylor-swift-interview-folklore-1033870/|title=How Aaron Dessner and Taylor Swift Stripped Down Her Sound on 'Folklore'|last=Blistein|first=Jon|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 24, 2020|accessdate=July 29, 2020}}</ref> and was the first song written from the album altogether.

[[File:Taylor Swift - Cardigan (music video screenshot).png|thumb|right|A scene in the music video, where Swift plays a [[moss]]-covered piano, from which a [[waterfall]] emerges.|250x250px]]
An official [[music video]] for "Cardigan"—written, directed, and styled by Swift—was released alongside the album and the song.<ref name="NME">{{cite news |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/taylor-swift-to-release-surprise-eighth-album-folklore-tonight-2713735 |title=Taylor Swift to release surprise eighth album 'Folklore' tonight |last=Reilly |first=Nick |magazine=[[NME]] |date=July 23, 2020 |access-date=July 23, 2020}}</ref> The "homespun" and "dreamlike" video starts out with Swift sitting in a candlelit [[cottage]] in the woods, wearing a [[nightgown]] and playing a [[Vintage (design)|vintage]] upright [[piano]]. This scene also features a photograph of Swift's grandfather, Dean, who fought in the [[Battle of guadalcanal|Battle of Guadalcanal]], and a painting that she painted during the first week of isolation.<ref name="VEVO Footnotes" /> When the soundboard starts glowing, she climbs into it and is magically transported to a [[moss]]-covered forest, where she plays the song on a grand piano producing a [[waterfall]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Huber|first=Eliza|date=July 24, 2020|title=Will Prairie & Cottagecore Fashion Define Taylor Swift's Folklore Era?|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9931460/taylor-swift-folklore-fashion-clothing-trend|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 27, 2020|website=[[Refinery29]]|language=en}}</ref><ref name="PrietoRS" /> 

The piano bench starts to glow and she climbs into it.

According to a video posted to her [[Vevo]] account, the forest scene "represents the evergreen beginning of a relationship where everything seems magical and full of beauty", while the ocean scene "represents the isolation and fear involved while a relationship is breaking down." The video also states the ending scene "signifies returning to a sense of self after experiencing love loss", discovering one's true self; Swift's soaking-wet nightgown signifies how the relationship changes the individual.<ref name="VEVO Footnotes">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=August 17, 2020|title=Taylor Swift - The Making of cardigan - Vevo Footnotes|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=GPQdWYNi8Wc|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=August 17, 2020|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[Taylor Swift]]}}</ref> The music video is characterized by a [[prairie]], [[cottagecore]] aesthetic.<ref name=":1" />

The music video was inspired by the [[Historical drama|period]] and [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] films that Swift watched in isolation during [[COVID-19 lockdown]].<ref name="VEVO Footnotes" /> She contacted cinematographer [[Rodrigo Prieto]] in early July to work on the video; Prieto had previously worked on the music video for "[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]", Swift's official solo directorial debut.<ref name="PrietoRS">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-rodrigo-prieto-folklore-1037586/|title=Taylor Swift's Cinematographer: How We Shot 'Folklore' Video During a Pandemic|last=Shaffer|first=Claire|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 31, 2020|accessdate=August 2, 2020}}</ref> As the director, Swift worked with assistant director Joe Osborne and set designer [[Ethan Tobman]].<ref name="PrietoRS"/> Swift developed the concept for the video, which Prieto described as "more ambiguous", "more personal", and "more of a fantasy" than "The Man".<ref name="PrietoRS"/> Ahead of filming, Swift drafted a shot list of the video, detailing the video's scenes with specific time sequences in the song, and sent visual references to Prieto and Tobman to communicate her vision of the video.<ref name="PrietoRS"/>

The ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic]] presented many challenges to filming, and extensive safety standards were enacted.

Additionally, the entire video was filmed from a camera mounted to a robotic arm controlled by a remote operator, a technique usually reserved for [[crane shot]]s and [[establishing shot]]s.<ref name="PrietoRS"/>

Aside from directing and acting, Swift also did her own makeup, hair, and styling for the video.<ref name="CardiganRS"/> To keep the song from being leaked, Swift wore an earpiece and lip-synced to the song.
