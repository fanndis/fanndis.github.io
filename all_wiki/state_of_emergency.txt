A '''state of emergency''' is a situation in which a government is empowered to be able to put through policies that it would normally not be permitted to do, for the safety and protection of their citizens. A government can declare such a state during a [[natural disaster]], [[civil unrest]], [[armed conflict]], medical [[pandemic]] or [[epidemic]] or other [[biosecurity]] risk. ''[[Justitium]]'' is its equivalent in [[Roman law]]—a concept in which the [[Roman Senate]] could put forward a final decree (''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'') that was not subject to dispute yet helped save lives in times of strife.

States of emergency can also be used as a rationale or pretext for suspending rights and freedoms guaranteed under a country's [[constitution]] or [[basic law]], sometimes through [[martial law]] or revoking [[habeas corpus]]. The procedure for and legality of doing so vary by country.

==Relationship with international law==
Under [[international law]], rights and freedoms may be suspended during a state of emergency, depending on the severity of the emergency and a government's policies.

==Use and viewpoints==<!--Linked from 'Giorgio Agamben'-->
Though fairly uncommon in democracies, [[dictatorship|dictatorial]] regimes often declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights.<ref>See Judson, 2012, "[http://otago.ourarchive.ac.nz/handle/10523/2279 Where is R2P grounded in international law]".</ref> In some situations, [[martial law]] is also declared, allowing the [[military]] greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. [[Nicole Questiaux]] (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs]], have recommended to the international community to adopt the following "principles" to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles of Legality, Proclamation, Notification, Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf. "Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency", E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also ''[[:fr:état d'exception|état d'exception]]'').

Article 4 to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), permits states to [[Derogation|derogate]] from certain rights guaranteed by the ICCPR in "time of public emergency". Any measures derogating from obligations under the Covenant, however, must be to only the extent required by the exigencies of the situation, and must be announced by the State Party to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. The [[European Convention on Human Rights]]<ref>''[[European Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 15</ref> and [[American Convention on Human Rights]]<ref>''[[American Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 27</ref> have similar derogatory provisions. No derogation is permitted to the [[ILO Conventions|International Labour Conventions]].

Some [[political theory|political theorists]], such as [[Carl Schmitt]], have argued that the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] to decide the initiation of the state of emergency defines [[sovereignty]] itself. In [[State of Exception (2005)|''State of Exception'' (2005)]], [[Giorgio Agamben]] criticized this idea, arguing that the mechanism of the state of emergency deprives certain people of their [[civil and political rights]], producing his interpretation of ''[[homo sacer]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Agamben|2005}}</ref>

===Graduation===
In many [[democracy|democratic]] states there are a selection of [[constitutional law|legal]] definitions for specific states of emergency,<ref>[http://www.astho.org/Programs/Preparedness/Public-Health-Emergency-Law/Emergency-Authority-and-Immunity-Toolkit/Emergency-Declarations-and-Authorities-Fact-Sheet/ USA ASTHO Emergency toolkit fact sheet]</ref> when the [[constitution]] of the [[State (polity)|State]] is partially in abeyance depending on the nature of the perceived threat to the [[general public]]. In order of severity these may include:
*[[Martial law]] when civil rights are severely restricted by the imposition of [[military force]] within a [[Sovereign state]], for example during a period of extreme threat of [[invasion]] or actual [[hostilities]] by foreign forces
* [[state of siege]] when the civil rights of specified persons or groups such as [[activist|political activists]] are likely to be curtailed, for example to prevent an [[insurrection]] or organised acts of [[treason]] by suspected [[Agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]]
* [[emergency|civil emergency]] dealing with [[disaster area]]s and requiring the deployment of extraordinary resources to contain dangerous situations such as [[natural disaster]]s or extensive [[Malice (law)|malicious]] [[property damage]] such as may occur during [[riot]]ing or by [[arson]]. As well as regular [[emergency service]]s, sometimes [[military forces]] may be assigned to deliver aid under especially [[Emergency procedure#Escalating Situations|dangerous conditions]] or to prevent [[looting]]

===Abuse===
The state of emergency can be [[abuse]]d by being invoked. An example would be to allow a state to suppress internal opposition without having to respect human rights. An example was the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 attempted coup]] in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) where the coup leaders invoked a state of emergency; the failure of the coup led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

Derogations by states having ratified or acceded to binding international agreements such as the ICCPR, the American and European Conventions on Human Rights and the International Labour Conventions are monitored by independent expert committees, regional Courts and other State Parties.<ref name=BBC />

==Law in selected countries==

===Argentina===
The Constitution, which has been amended several times, has always allowed for a state of emergency (literally ''estado de sitio'', "state of siege"), to be declared if the constitution or the authorities it creates are endangered by internal unrest or foreign attack. This provision was much abused during dictatorships, with long-lasting states of siege giving the government a free hand to suppress opposition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://derecho.laguia2000.com/derecho-politico/estado-de-sitio |title=State of emergency in Argentina and other Spanish-speaking countries (in Spanish) |publisher=Derecho.laguia2000.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (Pacto de San José de Costa Rica), adopted in 1969 but ratified by Argentina only in 1984 immediately after the end of the [[National Reorganization Process]], restricts abuse of the state of emergency by requiring any signatory nation declaring such a state to inform the other signatories of its circumstances and duration, and what rights are affected.

===Australia===
{{see also|Exceptional circumstances|Biosecurity in Australia|Biosecurity Act 2015}}
State-of-emergency legislation differs in each state of Australia. With regard to emergency management, regions (usually on a [[local government area]] basis) that have been affected by a [[natural disaster]] are the responsibility of the state, until that state declares a State of Emergency where access to the Federal Emergency Fund becomes available to help respond to and recover from natural disasters. A State of Emergency does not apply to the whole state, but rather [[districts]] or [[shire]]s, where essential services may have been disrupted.<ref>{{Cite web|last=State of Queensland|date=June 2019|title=Disaster and Emergency Incident Plan|url=https://www.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0031/628267/disaster-emergency-incident-plan.pdf|website=Queensland Government}}</ref>

On 18 March 2020,<ref name=decl/> a nationwide human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|coronavirus (COVID-19)]] pandemic, after the [[National Security Committee (Australia)|National Security Committee]] met the previous day.

This gives the Minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and [[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]]s.<ref name=emergdec>{{cite web |last=McPhee |first=Sarah |title=Human biosecurity emergency declared in Australia |website=news.com.au |date=30 March 2020 |url=https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/coronavirus-australia-human-biosecurity-emergency-declared/news-story/cd7fbff78297c076c8bb774595459c59 |access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> The ''Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020'' was declared by the Governor-General, [[David Hurley]], under Section 475 of the Act.<ref name=decl>{{cite document |url=https://nswbar.asn.au/uploads/pdf-documents/biosecurity_emergency.pdf |title=Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 |date=18 March 2020 |access-date=30 March 2020 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}</ref>

====New South Wales====
In [[New South Wales]], the [[Premier of New South Wales|NSW Premier]] can, pursuant to the ''State Emergency and Rescue Management Act 1989'', declare a state of emergency due to an actual or imminent occurrence (such as fire, flood, storm, earthquake, explosion, terrorist act, accident, epidemic or warlike action) which endangers, or threatens to endanger, the safety or health of persons or animals in the State, or destroys or damages, or threatens to destroy or damage, property in the State, or causes a failure of, or a significant disruption to, an essential service or infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|searma1989331|State Emergency and Rescue Management Act 1989|4}}</ref> The Premier declared a state of emergency on 11 November 2019 in response to the [[2019-2020 Australian bushfire season#New South Wales|2019-2020 New South Wales bushfires]]. It was the fifth time that a state of emergency had been declared in that state since 2006 and it lasted for seven days. Subsequent declarations were made on 19 December for a further seven days, and again on 2 January 2020. In NSW, the 2019-2020 bushfire season resulted in 26 deaths, destroyed 2,448 homes, and burnt {{convert|5.5|e6ha|e6acre|abbr=off}}.<ref name=":15">{{cite journal |title=Unprecedented season breaks all records |url=https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/174823/Bush-Fire-Bulletin-Vol-42-No1.pdf|journal=Bush Fire Bulletin |location=Sydney |publisher=NSW Rural Fire Service |volume=42 |issue=1 |page=3 |issn=1033-7598 |access-date=12 August 2020 }}</ref><ref name="BBC News 2020-02-14">{{cite news |author=Mao, Frances |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51498193 |title=Australia weather: How much rain did it take to put out NSW fires? |publisher=[[BBC News]] |location=UK |date=14 February 2020 |access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref>

====Victoria====
In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the [[Premier of Victoria|Victorian Premier]] can declare a '''state of emergency''' under the ''Public Safety Preservation Act 1958''<ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|VIC|act|pspa1958298|Public Safety Preservation Act 1958}}</ref> if there is a threat to employment, safety or public order.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/03/victoria-fires-state-of-disaster-declared-as-evacuation-ordered-and-second-man-found-dead |title=Victorian fires: state of disaster declared as evacuation ordered and 28 people missing |work=[[Guardian Australia]] |date=3 January 2020 |access-date=14 August 2020 |agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]}}</ref> A declared state of emergency allows the Premier to immediately make any desired regulations to secure public order and safety. The declaration expires after 30 days, and a resolution of either the upper or lower House of Parliament may revoke it earlier. However, these regulations expire if [[Victorian Parliament|Parliament]] does not agree to continue them within seven days. 

The Premier (or a delegate) may operate or prohibit operation of any '''essential service''', such as transport, fuel, power, water or gas, under the ''Essential Services Act 1958''.<ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|VIC|act|esa1958208|Essential Services Act 1958}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|VIC|act|esa1958208|Essential Services Act 1958|5}}</ref> 

If there is an emergency which the Premier, after considering the advice of the relevant Minister and the [[Emergency Management Victoria#Management and reporting|Emergency Management Commissioner]], is satisfied constitutes or is likely to constitute a significant and widespread danger to life or property in Victoria, the Premier, pursuant to the ''Emergency Management Act 1986'', may declare a '''state of disaster''' to exist in the whole or in any part or parts of the State.<ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|VIC|act|ema1986190|Emergency Management Act 1986|23}}</ref> The state of disaster addresses matters beyond public health issues and is intended to deal with emergencies such as natural disasters, explosions, terrorism or sieges, and it can also be used to deal with 'a plague or an epidemic'.<ref>{{cite web |author=Twomey, Anne |author-link=Anne Twomey |url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-a-state-of-disaster-and-what-powers-does-it-confer-143807 |title=Explainer: what is a 'state of disaster' and what powers does it confer? |work=[[The Conversation]] |date=2 August 2020 |access-date=14 August 2020}}</ref>

The ''Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008'' gives the Chief Health Officer extensive powers to take action ‘to investigate, eliminate or reduce public health risks’, including power to detain, restrict the movement of or prevent entry of any person in the emergency area, “and to give any other direction that the authorised officer considers is reasonably necessary to protect public health.”<ref> ''Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008'' , s 200.</ref>

===Brazil===
The current constitution of Brazil [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicao.htm] allows the [[President of Brazil|President]] to declare two states, in order to "preserve or establish peace and order, threatened by grave and imminent institutional instability or severe natural disasters".

The first, and less severe state is the ''state of defense'' (''estado de defesa'', in Portuguese), while a more severe form is the ''state of siege'' (''estado de sítio'').

In a ''state of defense'', the federal government can occupy and use any public building or demand any service as it sees fit. It may suppress [[Secrecy of correspondence]] and  [[Freedom of assembly]] as necessary, as long as it specifies a defined region and time period.

If president finds the ''state of defense'' insufficient, it might decree a ''state of siege''. This state further reduces [[Civil liberties]], removing [[Freedom of movement]], allowing for search without consent or warrant, and [[seizure]] of any assets the government deems necessary. The government may also intervene and direct the function of any company.

To balance this far-reaching powers, the Congress has to convene and approve the state in ten days or it is automatically cancelled. Further, the state of siege has to be revised by the congress every 30 days, unless it was raised as response to a war, in which case the government is free to set it to last until the end of the war.

Since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985, and the formation of the [[History of Brazil since 1985|sixth Brazilian Republic]], neither state has ever been raised.

===Canada===
{{main|War Measures Act|Emergencies Act|States of emergency in Canada}}
The [[Politics of Canada|federal government of Canada]] can use the [[Emergencies Act]] to invoke a state of emergency. A national state of emergency automatically expires after 90 days, unless extended by the Governor-in-Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/E-4.5/bo-ga:l_III-gb:s_35//en#anchorbo-ga:l_III-gb:s_35 |title=Emergencies Act |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=29 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105195914/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/E-4.5/bo-ga%3Al_III-gb%3As_35//en#anchorbo-ga:l_III-gb:s_35 |archive-date=5 January 2011}}</ref> There are different levels of emergencies: Public Welfare Emergency, Public Order Emergency, International Emergency, and War Emergency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowTdm/cs/E-4.5///en |title=Emergencies Act |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=29 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105200003/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowTdm/cs/E-4.5///en |archive-date=5 January 2011}}</ref>

The Emergencies Act replaced the [[War Measures Act]] in 1988. The War Measures Act was invoked three times in Canadian history, most controversially during the 1970 [[October Crisis]], and also during [[World War I]] (from 1914 to 1920, against threat of Communism) and [[World War II]] (from 1942 to 1945, against perceived threat from Japanese Canadians following [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan's]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]).

Under the current Emergency Act a state of emergency can also be declared by provincial, territorial, and municipal governments.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/stateofemergency/ |title=State of Emergency FAQ |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=7 August 2003 |accessdate=29 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511111456/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/stateofemergency/ |archive-date=11 May 2011}}</ref> In addition Canada's federal government and any of its provincial governments can suspend, for five years at a time, [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]] rights to fundamental freedoms in section 2, to legal rights in sections 7 through 14, and to equality rights in section 15 by legislation which invokes [[Section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|the notwithstanding clause, section 33]], and therefore emergency powers can effectively be created even without using the Emergency Act.

Provincial governments can also invoke [[States of emergency in Canada|states of emergency]], and have done to respond to at least 12 incidents during the 21st century.

===Denmark===
The police chief in a district can impose a zone in which people can be [[strip search|body searched]] without a specific suspicion. Such an order must be issued in writing, published, and imposed for a limited period. The police law (article 6) regulates this area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=1836#K3 |title=The Danish police law&nbsp;— law number 444 of June 9, 2004 |publisher=Retsinformation.dk |date=21 September 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> The normal procedure calls for assisting the suspect to a private area and stripping them.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/indland/article472795.ece Politi: De unge klager over racistiske betjente] (The police: Youth complain over racist cops), by Andreas Lindqvist, Politiken, 18 February 2008</ref> The police can also impose a zone in which specific crimes such as violence, threats, blackmailing and vandalism can be punished with a double penalty length. The zone can only be imposed if there is an extraordinary crime development and the zone can only last up to three months unless the extraordinary crime development still applies after that period of time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/nyt-og-presse/pressemeddelelser/2018/politi-skal-kunne-udpege-zoner-med-skaerpet-straf |title=Politi skal kunne udpege zoner med skærpet straf (Police should be able to designate zones with stricter punishment) |language=da |author=Ministry of Justice |publisher=Ministry of Justice |date=3 October 2018 |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lovtidende.dk/pdf.aspx?id=205573 |title=Lov om ændring af straffeloven og lov om politiets virksomhed (Act on amending the Penal Code and the Act on Police Activities) |language=da |last=Poulsen |first=Søren Pape |author-link=Søren Pape Poulsen |work=Lovtidende |publisher=The Department of Civil Affairs |date=19 December 2018 |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref>

If the police feel that a situation involving a crowd of people can get out of hand, they can order the assembly to be dissolved and "pass the street" in the name of the king. People that after three such warnings are still part of the crowd can then without further warning be subjugated to [[mass arrest]]. All people arrested can then be detained for 24 hours without charging them or taking them for a judge. This is called a [[preventive detention|precluding arrest]].

Three main provisions concern various kind of "state of emergency" in France: Article 16 of the [[Constitution of France|Constitution of 1958]] allows, in time of crisis, "extraordinary powers" to the president. Article 36 of the same constitution regulates "state of siege" (''[[:fr:État de siège (France)|état de siège]]''). Finally, the Act of 3 April 1955 allows the proclamation, by the Council of Ministers, of the "state of emergency" (''[[:fr:État d'urgence en France|état d'urgence]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000695350 |title=Loi n°55-385 du 3 avril 1955 instituant un état d'urgence et en déclarant l'application en Algérie |language= fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> The distinction between article 16 and the 1955 Act concerns mainly the distribution of powers: whereas in article 16, the executive power basically suspend the regular procedures of the Republic, the 1955 Act permits a twelve-day state of emergency, after which a new law extending the emergency must be voted by the Parliament. These dispositions have been used at various times, in 1955, 1958, 1961, 1988, 2005, and 2015.

===Germany===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Eschede train disaster]] -->
The [[Weimar Republic]] constitution (1919–1933)<ref>Weimar constitution technically remained in effect throughout the Nazi era (1933–1945).</ref> allowed states of emergency under [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] to deal with rebellions. Article 48 was often invoked during the 14-year life of the Republic, sometimes for no reason other than to allow the government to act when it was unable to obtain a [[parliament]]ary majority.

After the 27 February 1933, [[Reichstag fire]], an attack blamed on the [[communism|communists]], [[Adolf Hitler]] declared a state of emergency using Article 48, and then had President [[Paul von Hindenburg|von Hindenburg]] sign the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which suspended some of the basic civil liberties provided by the [[Weimar Constitution]] (such as habeas corpus, freedom of expression, freedom of the speech, the freedom to assemble or the privacy of communications) for the whole duration of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=ReichstagFireDecree>{{cite web|title=Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State|url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/reichstag-fire-decree|date=28 February 1933}}</ref> On 23 March, the Reichstag enacted the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] with the required two-thirds majority, which enabled Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his cabinet to enact laws without the participation of the legislative. (The Weimar Constitution was never actually repealed by [[Nazi Germany]], but it effectively became ineffective after the passage of the Enabling Act.<ref name=Evans>{{Cite book| last=Evans | first=Richard J. | author-link=Richard J.

In the postwar [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] the ''[[German Emergency Acts|Emergency Acts]]'' state that some of the basic constitutional rights of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] may be limited in case of a [[State of Defence (Germany)|state of defence]], a state of tension, or an internal state of emergency or disaster (catastrophe). These amendments to the constitution were passed on 30 May 1968, despite fierce opposition by the so-called ''extra-parliamentary opposition'' (see [[German student movement#Emergency Acts|German student movement]] for details).

During a state of war or turmoil which threatens national security or unity, and which the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] believes is beyond the control of the local government, the Standing Committee can invoke Article 18 of the Hong Kong Basic Law and declare a "State of Emergency" in Hong Kong; thus, the [[Central People's Government]] can selectively implement national laws not normally allowed in Hong Kong.<ref name="basiclaw.gov.hk">{{cite web |url=https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/pda/en/basiclawtext/chapter_2.html |title=Basic Law Full Text - pda - chapter (2) |website=www.basiclaw.gov.hk |accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref> Deployment of troops from the [[People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison]] under the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Garrisoning the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" can happen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/zgrdw/englishnpc/Law/2007-12/11/content_1383602.htm |title=laws |website=www.npc.gov.cn |accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>

Although the [[People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison]] may not interfere in internal Hong Kong affairs, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government may invoke Article 14 of the Hong Kong Basic Law and request permission of the Central People's Government to have the garrison assist in "maintenance of public order or disaster relief".<ref name="basiclaw.gov.hk"/>

Since 1997, a State of Emergency has never been declared. However, emergency measures have been used in varying degrees over the years during British rule and after the establishment of the Special Administrative Region. A few notable mentions are as follow:

* [[Seamen's strike of 1922]] - Enactment of the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]], 1922 within one day on 28 February 1922
* [[Canton-Hong Kong strike]] 1925 - with involvement of police and soldiers from multiple nations

On 4 October 2019, Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong S.A.R., invoked Section 2(1) within "Cap. 241 Emergency Regulations Ordinance"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/241/|title=CAP 241 Emergency Regulations Ordinance|website=www.hklii.hk|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref> implemented since 1922 and last amended by the Legislative Council in 1999, which allow the government to implement the new, "Cap. 241K Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/241K/|title=CAP 241K PROHIBITION ON FACE COVERING REGULATION|website=www.hklii.hk|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref> The new regulation forbid public assembly participants from wearing masks or obscure faces during such events without reasonable excuses. The permitted excuses are: pre-existing medical or health reasons, religious reasons, and if the person uses the face covering for physical safety while performing an activity connected with their profession or employment. Any person defying the new regulation face possible criminal prosecution. The government's motive in doing so is to end months of social unrest and riots, however, did not declare a "State of Emergency". The new regulation took effect at 00:00 HKT on 5 October 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201910/04/P2019100400613.htm|title=Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation gazetted|website=www.info.gov.hk|accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref> Offenders risked a maximum of one-year imprisonment or a fine of HK$25,000 (US$3,200).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2019/10/20191004/20191004_181429_379.html|title=Anti-mask law gazetted|website=Hong Kong's Information Services Department|language=zh-hk|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>

The [[High Court of Hong Kong]] denied an application for a judicial injunction of the anti-mask law, on the same night shortly before the new regulation took effect. A subsequent attempt by [[pro-democrats]] to halt the new regulation also failed, however, the court recommended a judicial review at a later date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1485021-20191008.htm?archive_date=2019-10-08|title=Judge explains reason for not allowing injunction - RTHK|website=news.rthk.hk|language=en-gb|accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>

On 18 November 2019, the High Court ruled the "Cap. 241 Emergency Regulations Ordinance" is "incompatible with the Basic Law", however, the court "leaves open the question of the constitutionality of the ERO insofar as it relates to any occasion of emergency." The court also held the ordinance meets the "prescribed by law" requirement. However, the court deemed s3(1)(b), (c),  (d) and s5 of the regulation do not meet the proportionality test as they impose restrictions on fundamental rights that goes beyond what is necessary in furthering its intended goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2019/2820.html|title=KWOK WING HANG AND OTHERS v.

On 22 November 2019, the High Court made the following remark:

===Hungary===
{{update section|date=April 2020}}
According to the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Constitution, the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] can declare state of emergency in case of armed rebellion or natural or industrial disaster. It expires after 30 days, but can be extended. Most civil rights can be suspended, but basic human rights (such as the right to life, the ban of torture, and freedom of religion) cannot.

During state of emergency, the Parliament cannot be disbanded.

===Iceland===
The [[Constitution of Iceland|Icelandic constitution]] provides no mechanism for the declaration of war, martial law nor state of emergency.

===India===
{{Main|States of emergency in India}}

The State of Emergency can be proclaimed by the [[President of India]], when he/she perceives grave threats to the nation, albeit through the advice of the cabinet of ministers. Part XVIII of the [[Constitution of India]] gives the President the power to overrule many provisions, including the ones guaranteeing [[fundamental right]]s to the [[citizen]]s of India

In India, a state of emergency was declared twice:

# Between 26 October 1962 to 10 January 1968 during the [[Sino-Indian War|India-China]] war — "the security of India" having been declared "threatened by external aggression".
# Between 3 December 1971 to 21 March 1977 originally proclaimed during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indo Pakistan war]], and later extended on 25 June 1975, along with the third proclamation — "the security of India" having been declared "threatened by external aggression" and by "internal disturbances"

The [[The Emergency (India)|first internal Emergency]] was declared by the president, [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] on advice of the then Prime Minister, [[Indira Gandhi]] The provisions of the Constitution allows the Prime Minister to rule by [[decree]].

===Ireland===
In Ireland declaring a state of "national emergency" involves Article 28.3.3° of the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]], which states that:<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article28_3_3|title=Constitution of Ireland|series=[[Irish Statute Book]]|chapter=Article 28.3.3° |accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref>

In addition, during a "war or armed rebellion", [[military tribunal]]s may try civilians,<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article38_4_1|title=Constitution of Ireland|series=[[Irish Statute Book]]|chapter=Article 38.4.1° |accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref> and the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] are not bound by [[habeas corpus]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article40_4_5|title=Constitution of Ireland|series=[[Irish Statute Book]]|chapter=Article 40.4.5° |accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref>

The first amendment was rushed through the Oireachtas after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], in which [[Irish neutrality during World War II|the state remained neutral]]. Immediately after, the required resolution was passed, in turn enabling the passage of the [[Emergency Powers Act 1939]] (EPA), which granted the [[government of Ireland|government]] and its ministers sweeping powers to issue [[statutory order]]s termed "Emergency Powers Orders" (EPOs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1939090200001|title=Proceedings of 2 September 1939|work=Dáil Éireann debates|pages=Vol.77 cc.1–190|accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/act/28/enacted/en/html|title=Emergency Powers Act, 1939|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref> (The period in Ireland was and is referred to as "[[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]".)

===Israel===
Israel's [[Defence (Emergency) Regulations|Emergency Defence Regulations]] are older than the state itself, having been passed under the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]] in 1945. A repeal was briefly considered in 1967 but cancelled following the [[Six-Day War]]. The regulations allow Israel, through [[Israeli Defense Forces|its military]], to control movements and prosecute suspected terrorists in [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]], and to censor publications that are deemed prejudicial to national defense.

===Italy===
In Italy, the state of emergency planned by the legal system is implemented by the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]], without the need of a parliamentary vote, due to the Law n. 225 of 1992 on [[Protezione Civile|Civil Protection]].<ref>[http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/home#eme_ambientale Stati di emergenza], ''Protezione Civile''</ref> Moreover, the Article 120 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]] provides that the government can exercise "substitute powers" of local authorities in typically situations: to protect the legal or economic unity of the state, in case of violation of supranational laws and to face a serious danger for safety and public safety.<ref>''Le situazioni di emergenza e di grave necessità pubblica, in La pubblica sicurezza'', G. Motzo, [[Vicenza]], 1967</ref> For other emergency, such as a [[war]], a parliamentary vote is required to give extraordinary powers to the government.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/12431137/stato_di_eccezione_ed_ordinamento_democratico Lo stato di eccezione ed ordinamento democratico], Giampiero Buonomo</ref>

The Parliament can also give extraordinary powers to the government in case of health emergency, as it occurred during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in 2020, when the Parliament approved a state of emergency from 31 January to 15 October 2020, thanks to what the government can implement administrative acts, without the approval of the Parliament.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-28/conte-says-italy-to-extend-state-of-emergency-to-october?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google Conte Says Italy to Extend State of Emergency to October], ''Bloomberg''</ref>

===Macau SAR (China)===
The [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] can declare a state of emergency and deploy troops from the [[People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison]] under the Article 14 of Macau's Basic Law on the defence of the Macau Special Administrative Region.

Since 1999 no emergency measure have been enacted. Prior to 1999 emergency measures have been used for 1 major incident:
* [[12-3 incident]] (1966) – with [[martial law]] invoked and involvement of [[Portuguese Army|Portuguese troops]]

===Malaysia===
{{Main|Malayan Emergency}}
In [[Malaysia]], if the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (Monarch) is satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby the security, or the economic life, or public order in the Federation or any part thereof is threatened, he may issue a Proclamation of Emergency making therein a declaration to that effect.<ref>Clause 1(A), Article 150, Constitution of Malaysia</ref>

In the history of Malaysia, a state of emergency was declared by the then-colonial government of Britain. The state of emergency lasted from 1948 until 1960 to deal with the [[Malayan Communist Party|communists]] led by [[Chin Peng]].

States of emergency were also declared during the ''[[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|Konfrontasi]]'' in 1962, the [[1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis]] and [[1977 Kelantan Emergency]].

When a [[May 13 incident|race riot]] broke out on 13 May 1969, a state of emergency was declared.

On 11 August 2005, a state of emergency was announced for the world's 13th-largest [[port]], [[Port Klang]] and the [[district]] of [[Kuala Selangor]] after air pollution there reached dangerous levels (defined as a value greater than 500 on the [[Air Pollution Index]] or API).

Thierry Rommel, the European Commission's envoy to Malaysia, told [[Reuters]] by telephone on 13 November 2007 (the last day of his mission) that, "Today, this country still lives under (a state of) emergency."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-30475820071113?pageNumber=1 |publisher=Reuters |title=Malaysia lives under state of emergency&nbsp;— EU envoy |date=13 November 2007}}</ref> Although not officially proclaimed as a state of emergency, the Emergency Ordinance and the Internal Security Act had allowed detention for years without trial.

On 23 June 2013, a state of emergency was declared by Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak for Muar and Ledang, Johor as smoke from land-clearing fires in Indonesia pushed air pollution index to above 750. This was the first time in years that air quality had dipped to a hazardous level with conditions worsening as dry weather persisted and fires raged in Sumatra.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/749914 |title=PM declares haze emergency in Muar and Ledang |publisher=theSundaily |date=23 June 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018014417/http://www.thesundaily.my/news/749914 |archive-date=18 October 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Maldives===

A state of emergency was declared on 26 December 2004, following the [[2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami]]. The resulting tsunamis caused extensive damage to the country's infrastructure, cutting off communications from large swathes of the nation, decimating islands and forcing the closure of a number of resorts due to the damage.

On 5 February 2018, a state of emergency was declared by Maldives's President [[Abdulla Yameen]] for 15 days and ordered security forces into the [[Supreme Court of the Maldives]] and arrested former president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] and the [[Chief Justice of the Maldives]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/maldives-chief-justice-abdulla-saeed-arrested-as-president-abdulla-yameen-declares-state-of-emergenc-1809050 | title=Maldives Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed Arrested As President Abdulla Yameen declares state of emergency| publisher=NDTV news | date=6 February 2018 | accessdate=6 February 2018}}</ref>

* On 25 March 2020 at 12.21pm, the Minister for Civil Defence [[Peeni Henare]] declared a state of national emergency in response to the total cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] reaching 205. Combined with an epidemic notice issued under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006, the state of emergency declaration enabled authorities to close most premises in New Zealand and enforce a [[Stay-at-home order|nationwide lockdown]]. This also provided access to special powers to combat COVID-19, including powers of requisition and closing roads and restricting movement. Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management [[Sarah Stuart-Black]] said these powers sat alongside other powers to ensure essential services could stay up and running.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/coronavirus-covid-19-state-of-emergency-declared-in-new-zealand-50-new-cases-confirmed/|title= Covid-19: State of emergency declared in New Zealand|last= Herald|first= N.

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, a state of emergency is usually declared in times of great civil unrest. In recent years, it has specifically been implemented in reaction to terrorist attacks on Nigerians by the Islamic jihadist group [[Boko Haram]].

On 14 May 2013, [[Goodluck Jonathan]] declared a state of emergency for the entire northeastern states of [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Yobe]] and [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/14/us-nigeria-emergency-idUSBRE94D0ZH20130514 |publisher=Reuters |title=Nigeria declares emergency in areas hit by Islamists |date=14 May 2013}}</ref> A more limited state of emergency had been declared on 31 December 2011 in parts of Yobe, Borno, [[Plateau State|Plateau]] and [[Niger State|Niger]] states.

===Pakistan===
{{further|2007 Pakistani state of emergency}}
In Pakistan, a state of emergency was declared five times in its history:
* In 1958 by President [[Iskander Mirza]]
* In 1969 by President General [[Yahya Khan]]
* In 1977 by President General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]
* In 1998 by President [[Muhammad Rafiq Tarar]]
* In [[2007 Pakistani state of emergency|2007]] by President General [[Pervez Musharraf]]

The first three were regarded as the imposition of direct martial law.

=== Philippines===
{{further|2006 state of emergency in the Philippines|2016 state of emergency in the Philippines}}
There are several situations that calls for various levels of government action in the Philippines. The constitution alludes to these:
*State of war: Declared by [[Manuel L. Quezon]] in 1941 during World War II.
*[[Martial law in the Philippines|State of martial law]]: Six declarations in history ([[Philippine Revolution|1896]], [[Dictatorial Government of the Philippines|1898]], 1944, [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|1972]], [[Maguindanao massacre|2009]] and [[Proclamation No. 216|2017]])

These are not specified in the constitution, but were nevertheless declared at least once:
*[[State of rebellion]]: Last declared in 2003 due to the [[Oakwood mutiny]]
*State of emergency: Last two declarations were in [[2006 state of emergency in the Philippines|2006]] and [[2016 state of emergency in the Philippines|2016]].
*State of public health emergency: Last declared in 2020 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines]]. 
*[[State of calamity (Philippines)|State of calamity]]: Last national declaration was in 2020 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines]]. Local governments are also empowered to declare local states of calamity in their areas.

The current [[Constitution of Portugal]] empowers the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]]<ref name="CRP134">{{cite web |url=https://dre.pt/part-iii |title=Article 134 (Personal competences) |website=Constitution of the Portuguese Republic |publisher=Diário da República Eletrónico |access-date=18 March 2020 }}</ref> to declare a state of siege ({{lang-pt|estado de sítio}}) or a state of emergency ({{lang-pt|estado de emergência}}) in part or the entirety of the Portuguese territory, only in cases of actual or imminent aggression by foreign forces, serious threats to or disturbances of the democratic constitutional order, or public disasters.<ref name="CRP19">{{cite web |url=https://dre.pt/part-i |title=Article 19 (Suspension of the exercise of rights) |website=Constitution of the Portuguese Republic |publisher=Diário da República Eletrónico |access-date=18 March 2020 }}</ref>

Such declarations allow the entities that exercise sovereignty from suspending the exercise of some of the constitutionally defined rights, freedoms and guarantees, so that the public authorities can take the appropriate and strictly necessary measures for the prompt restoration of constitutional normality; the Constitution, however, sets a temporal limit for these states of emergency (no more than fifteen days, even though renewal is possible) and forbids any suspension of the [[right to life]], to personal integrity, [[Right to personal identity|to personal identity]], to civil capacity and citizenship, [[Ex post facto law|the non-retroactivity of criminal law]], the [[right to a fair trial]], or the [[Freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] and [[Freedom of religion|religion]].<ref name="CRP19"/> They also may not affect the constitutionally-defined competences and mode of operation of the entities that exercise sovereignty. The [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] may not be dissolved while a state of siege or a state of emergency is in force,<ref name="CRP172">{{cite web |url=https://dre.pt/part-iii |title=Article 172 (Dissolution) |website=Constitution of the Portuguese Republic |publisher=Diário da República Eletrónico |access-date=18 March 2020 }}</ref> nor can the Constitution itself be subject to amendment.<ref name="CRP289">{{cite web |url=https://dre.pt/part-iv |title=Article 289 (Circumstances in which revision is restricted) |website=Constitution of the Portuguese Republic |publisher=Diário da República Eletrónico |access-date=18 March 2020 }}</ref>

Before declaring a state of siege or a state of emergency, the President is required to consult with the [[Government of Portugal|Government]] and request authorisation to do so from the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]].<ref name="CRP138">{{cite web |url=https://dre.pt/part-iii |title=Article 138 (Declaration of a state of siege or of a state of emergency) |website=Constitution of the Portuguese Republic |publisher=Diário da República Eletrónico |access-date=18 March 2020 }}</ref>

During the [[Third Portuguese Republic]], the only two times such states of exceptional suppression of constitutional provisions were declared were during the [[Coup of 25 November 1975|failed left-wing coup d'état of 25 November 1975]] (state of siege, within the confines of the Lisbon Military Region),<ref>{{cite news |date=18 March 2020 |title=Papel dos militares muda entre estado de sítio e estado de emergência  |url=https://www.publico.pt/2020/03/18/politica/noticia/papel-militares-muda-estado-sitio-estado-emergencia-1908257 |language=pt |work=[[Público (Portugal)|Público]] |access-date=20 March 2020 }}</ref> and during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal|COVID-19 pandemic]] (state of emergency, in the entirety of the Portuguese territory).

Within the remit of the basic law of [[Civil defense|civil protection]] services, the [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]] can, through a Resolution of the [[Council of Ministers (Portugal)|Council of Ministers]] and without the need of parliamentary approval or presidential promulgation, decree a situation of calamity ({{lang-pt|situação de calamidade}}). Lesser exceptional statuses, the situation of contingency ({{lang-pt|situação de contingência}}) and the situation of alert ({{lang-pt|situação de alerta}}) in descending order of importance, can also be set in motion by other civil protection authorities or [[President of the Municipal Chamber|Mayors]].<ref name="LeiDeBasesProCiv">{{cite web |url=https://dre.pt/web/guest/legislacao-consolidada/-/lc/66285526/indice |title=Lei de Bases da Protecção Civil (Lei n.º 27/2006) |website=Diário da República Eletrónico |publisher=Diário da República n.º 126/2006, Série I de 2006-07-03 |access-date=4 May 2020 }}</ref> These three situations allow for some extraordinary measures and special restrictions, but not the suspension of constitutional rights and freedoms.

===Romania===
{{Disputed section|date=June 2015}}
In [[Romania]], there are two types of states of emergency, each designed for a different type of situation.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* State of alert (''Stare de alertă'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]): Non-military, can be enforced by a prefect. [[Roadblock]]s are enforced. Any utilitarian vehicle or equipment can be temporarily used by the state, without any restriction. Evacuation is not mandatory, unless extreme circumstances apply. Only [[Emergency medical services|EMS]], [[Romanian Police|Police]] and firefighting personnel are required to intervene. This situation can be enforced in case of [[natural disasters]] or [[civil unrest]].
* State of emergency (''stare de urgentă'' in Romanian): Can only be enforced by the [[President of Romania]] with approval from [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]]. The [[Military of Romania|military]] becomes the upper form of control in the country (under the rule of the president).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The civilian population is subject to strict regulations, imposed by the type of emergency.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} All private and public non-crucial activities are suspended.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} [[Essential services]] might be disrupted. This situation can be enforced in case of extreme circumstances, such as a war.
* Special zone of public safety (''Zonă specială de siguranță publică'' in Romanian): Administrative, can be enforced by local police. This implies installation of road check-points and higher numbers in police and [[Romanian riot police|gendarmes/ riot police]] presence, patrolling the area. There is also a ban that restricts the right to travel for people in the area; any vehicle and individual transiting the zone are subject to screening.<ref name=zona>Silviu Molnar, [http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/chevron-shale-security-zone-pungesti-romania Security Zone in Pungesti Heavily Criticized by European Greens], ''Natural Gas Europe'', 19 December 2013, Retrieved 23 December 2013</ref><ref>{{in lang|ro}}[http://adevarul.ro/locale/vaslui/video-comuna-pungesti-declarata-zona-speciala-siguranta-publica-1_52a46389c7b855ff568bb1f6/index.html Comuna Pungești, declarată „zonă specială de siguranță publică], ''Adevărul'', 19 December 2013, Retrieved 23 December 2013</ref>

The most well-known event in which the state of emergency has been enforced was because of [[1977 Vrancea earthquake]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The last instance in which the ''special zone of public safety'' was enforced was on 8 December 2013-ongoing, in [[Pungești, Vaslui]] following [[2012–13 Romanian protests against shale gas|civil unrest in Pungești]] from [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]'s plans to begin exploring shale-gas in the village.<ref>Gabriel Petrescu, [http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/riot-police-special-security-zone-chevron-romania Chevron Moves Forward in Romania Following Establishment of Special Security Zone], ''Natural Gas Europe'', 14 December 2013, Retrieved 23 December 2013</ref> According to police officials, the special security zone will be maintained as long as there is conflict in the area that poses a threat to Chevron's operations.<ref name=zona /> This special security zone has faced domestic and international criticism for alleged human-rights abuses.

===Russia===
{{main|State of emergency in Russia}}

=== Sierra Leone ===
[[Sierra Leone]] declared, on 7 February 2019, a State of Emergency due to ongoing rape and sexual violence in the country.<ref>[https://statehouse.gov.sl/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Statement-by-His-Excellency-Julius-Maada-Bio-President-of-the-Republic-of-Sierra-Leone-on-the-Declaration-of-Rape-and-Sexual-Violence-as-Public-Emergency-Freetown-7-February-2019.pdf ''Statement for the Declaration of Rape and Sexual Violence as a National Emergency by His Excellency President Julius Maada Bio'' State House, 7th February 2019.]</ref> On 24 March 2020, a state of emergency was declared by His Excellency (Rtd) Brigadier Julius Madaa Bio due to global pandemic of the coronavirus.

===South Africa===
{{further|State of Emergency Act, 1997}}
States of emergency in [[South Africa]] are governed by section 37 of the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] and by the [[State of Emergency Act, 1997]]. The [[President of South Africa|President]] may declare a state of emergency only when "the life of the nation is threatened by war, invasion, general insurrection, disorder, natural disaster or other public emergency" and if the ordinary laws and government powers are not sufficient to restore peace and order. The declaration is made by [[proclamation]] in the ''[[Government Gazette of South Africa|Government Gazette]]'' and may only apply from the time of publication, not retroactively. It can only continue for 21 days unless the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] grants an extension, which may be for at most three months at a time. The [[High Courts of South Africa|High Courts]] have the power, subject to confirmation by the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], to determine the validity of the declaration of a state of emergency.<ref name="sa-bor-handbook">{{cite book |first1=Iain |last1=Currie |first2=Johan |last2=de Waal |title=The Bill of Rights Handbook |edition=5th |year=2005 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta & Company Ltd |isbn=9780702159237 |chapter=Chapter Thirty-three: States of Emergency |pages=798–806}}</ref>

During a state of emergency the President has the power to make emergency regulations "necessary or expedient" to restore peace and order and end the emergency. This power can be delegated to other authorities. Emergency measures can violate the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], but only to a limited extent. Some rights are inviolable, including amongst others the rights to life and to human dignity; the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race, sex or religion; the prohibition of torture or inhumane punishment; and the right of accused people to a fair trial. Any violation of a constitutional right must be strictly required by the emergency. Emergency measures may not indemnify the government or individuals for illegal actions. They may impose criminal penalties, but not exceeding three years' imprisonment. They may not require military service beyond that required by the ordinary laws governing the defence force. An emergency measure may be disapproved by the National Assembly, in which case it lapses, and no emergency measure may interfere with the elections, powers or sittings of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] or the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]]. The courts have the power to determine the validity of any emergency measure.

The constitution places strict limits on any [[detention without trial]] during a state of emergency. A friend or family member of the detainee must be informed, and the name and place of detention must be published in the ''Government Gazette''. The detainee must have access to a doctor and a legal representative. He or she must be brought before a court within at most ten days, for the court to determine whether the detention is necessary, and if not released may demand repeated review every ten days. At the court review the detainee must be allowed legal representation and must be allowed to appear in person. The provisions on detention without trial do not apply to [[prisoners of war]] in an international conflict; instead they must be treated in accordance with the [[Geneva Conventions]] and other international law.

===Spain===
In Spain, there are three degrees of state of emergency (''estado de emergencia'' in Spanish): ''[[State of Alarm|alarma]]'' (alarm or alert), ''excepción'' (exception[al circumstance]) and ''sitio'' (siege). They are named by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|constitution]], which limits which rights may be suspended, but regulated by the "[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo4-1981.html Ley Orgánica 4/1981]" ([[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Law]]).

A larger number of soldiers or of a longer duration is subject to [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|parliamentary]] decision. For deployments within Switzerland the principle of subsidiarity rules: as a first step, unrest has to be overcome with the aid of cantonal police units.

===Syria===
An emergency prevailed in [[Syria]] from 1962 to 2011. Originally predicated on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|conflict with Israel]], the emergency acted to centralize authority in the presidency and the national security apparatus while silencing public dissent. The emergency was terminated in response to protests that preceded the [[Syrian Civil War]]. Under the 2012 constitution, the president may pass an emergency decree with a 2/3 concurrence of his ministers, provided that he presents it to the legislature for constitutional review.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
A state of emergency was declared in 1970 during the [[Black Power Revolution]] by then Prime Minister [[Eric Williams]].

The Prime Minister [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]] announced a state of emergency on 22 August 2011 at 8:00&nbsp;pm in an attempt to crack down on the trafficking of illegal drugs and firearms, in addition to gangs. The decision of the President, [[George Maxwell Richards]], to issue the proclamation for the state of emergency was debated in [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|the country's Parliament]] as required by the Constitution on 2 September 2011 and passed by the required simple majority of the House of Representatives. On 4 September the Parliament extended the state of emergency for a further 3 months. It ended in December 2011.

===Turkey===
{{Main|Martial law and state of emergency in Turkey}}
Since the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 the [[Turkish Armed Forces|military]] conducted three [[coup d'état|''coups d'état'']] and announced [[martial law]]. Martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a state of emergency that lasted until November 2002.
The latest state of emergency was declared by [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|President Erdoğan]] on 20 July 2016 following a failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016 by a faction of the country's armed forces. It was lifted on 18 July 2018.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Civil Contingencies Act 2004}}
In the United Kingdom, only the [[British Sovereign]],<ref>The sovereign of the UK always follows the advice of the Prime Minister on any action with constitutional significance</ref> on the advice of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], or a [[Minister of the Crown]] in exceptional circumstances, has the power to introduce emergency regulations under the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]], in case of an emergency, broadly defined as war or attack by a foreign power, terrorism which poses a threat of serious damage to the security of the UK, or events which threaten serious damage to human welfare or the environment of a place in the UK. The duration of these regulations is limited to thirty days, but may be extended by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].
A state of emergency was last invoked in 1974 by Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] in response to increasing [[industrial action]].

The act grants wide-ranging powers to central and local government in the event of an emergency. It allows the modification of [[primary legislation]] by emergency regulation, with the exception of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.

{{Further|Senate Report 93-549|Insurrection Act|National Emergencies Act|List of national emergencies in the United States}}
The [[United States Constitution]] implicitly provides some emergency powers in the article about the executive power :
* Congress may authorize the government to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion.
* Congress may authorize the government to suspend consideration of writs of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]'' "when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it."
* [[Felony]] charges may be brought without presentment or [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] in cases arising "in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger."
* A state government may engage in war without Congress's approval if "actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay."

Aside from these, many provisions of law exist in various jurisdictions, which take effect only upon an executive declaration of emergency; some 500 federal laws take effect upon a presidential declaration of emergency. The [[National Emergencies Act]] regulates this process at the federal level. It requires the President to specifically identify the provisions activated and to renew the declaration annually so as to prevent an arbitrarily broad or open-ended emergency.
Presidents have occasionally taken action justified as necessary or prudent because of a state of emergency, only to have the action struck down in court as unconstitutional.<ref>''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1953)</ref>

A state [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or local [[mayor]] may declare a state of emergency within his or her [[jurisdiction]]. This is common at the state level in response to natural disasters. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] maintains a system of assets, personnel and training to respond to such incidents. For example, on 10 December 2015, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state Governor [[Jay Inslee]] declared a state of emergency due to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains.<ref>{{cite news|title=Washington gov. declares weather emergency|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/12/10/washington-gov-declares-weather-emergency/77081310/|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=USA Today|date=10 December 2015}}</ref>

The 1977 [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] allows the government to freeze assets, limit trade and confiscate property in response to an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to the United States that originates substantially outside of it. As of 2015 more than twenty emergencies under the IEEPA remain active regarding various subjects, the oldest of which was declared in 1979 with regard to the government of [[Iran]]. Another ongoing national emergency, declared after the [[September 11 attacks]], authorizes the president to retain or reactivate military personnel beyond their normal term of service.<ref>US Presidential Proclamation 7463</ref>
