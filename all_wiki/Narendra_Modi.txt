Modi is a member of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), a [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister outside of the [[Indian National Congress]] to win two consecutive terms with a full majority and the second to complete more than five years in office after [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Malik |first1=Aman |title=Elections 2019: PM Modi returns with bigger mandate, faces growth challenge |url=https://www.vccircle.com/elections-2019-pm-modi-returns-with-bigger-mandate-faces-growth-challenge/ |accessdate=23 May 2019 |work=VCCircle |date=23 May 2019}}</ref>

Born to a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] family in [[Vadnagar]], Modi helped his father sell tea as a child and has said he later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. Modi left home after finishing high-school in part due to [[child marriage]] to [[Jashodaben|Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi]], which he abandoned and publicly acknowledged only many decades later. Modi travelled around India for two years and visited a number of religious centres before returning to Gujarat. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.

Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to [[Keshubhai Patel]]'s failing health and poor public image following the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|earthquake in Bhuj]]. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the [[2002 Gujarat riots]],{{efn|Sources describing Modi's administration as complicit in the 2002 violence.<ref name="Bobbio" /><ref name="The Clash Within" /><ref name="Shani" /><ref name="Buncombe" /><ref name="Jaffrelot2013" />}} or otherwise criticised for its handling of it. A Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.{{efn|In 2012, a court stated that investigations had found no evidence against Modi.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17664751|title=India Gujarat Chief Minister Modi cleared in riots case|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=10 April 2012|accessdate=17 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220174351/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17664751|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sit-finds-no-proof-against-modi-says-court/article3300175.ece|title=SIT finds no proof against Modi, says court|newspaper=The Hindu|date=10 April 2012|accessdate=17 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221082846/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sit-finds-no-proof-against-modi-says-court/article3300175.ece|archivedate=21 December 2016|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Manas}}</ref>}} His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/world/asia/16iht-letter16.html|title=Shaking Off the Horror of the Past in India|last=Joseph|first=Manu|date=15 February 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=19 May 2017|issn=0362-4331|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312085254/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/world/asia/16iht-letter16.html|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref> His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.{{efn|Sources stating that Modi has failed to improve human development indices in Gujarat.<ref name="Buncombe" /><ref name="Jaffrelot2013" />}}

Modi led the BJP in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general election]] which gave the party a majority in the Indian [[lower house]] of parliament, the [[Lok Sabha]], the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralised power by abolishing the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]]. He began a [[Swachh Bharat Mission|high-profile sanitation campaign]], initiated a controversial [[2016 Indian banknote demonetisation|demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes]] and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.

Following his party's victory in the [[2019 Indian general election|2019 general election]], his administration [[Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir|revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir]]. His administration also introduced the [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019|Citizenship Amendment Act]], which resulted in [[Citizenship Amendment Act protests|widespread protests]] across the country. Described as engineering a political realignment towards [[right-wing politics]], Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his alleged role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an [[Social exclusion|exclusionary social]] agenda.{{efn|Sources discussing the controversy surrounding Modi.<ref name="Buncombe">{{cite news |title=A rebirth dogged by controversy |first=Andrew |last=Buncombe |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/a-rebirth-dogged-by-controversy-2357157.html |work=The Independent |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2012 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225024707/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/a-rebirth-dogged-by-controversy-2357157.html |archivedate=25 December 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Menon |first=Kalyani Devaki|title=Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India |year=2012 |publisher=The University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-2234-0 |page=26 |quote=Yet, months after this violent pogrom against Muslims, the Hindu nationalist chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, went to the polls and won a resounding victory}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mishra |first=Pankaj |title=Perspectives on Modern South Asia: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation|date=April 2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0062-5|page=188|editor-first=Kamala |editor-last=Visweswaran|quote=The chief minister of Gujarat, a young up-and-coming leader of the Hindu nationalists called Narendra Modi, quoted Isaac Newton to explain the killings of Muslims.

== Early political career ==
In June 1975, Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] declared a [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as "The Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.{{sfn|Guha|2008|p=493–494}}{{sfn|Kochanek|Hardgrave|2007|p=205}} Modi was appointed general secretary of the "Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=36–40}} Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.{{sfn|Marino|2014|p=43}}{{sfn|Mukhopadhyay|2013|p=150}} Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=38–43}} During this period, Modi wrote a book in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], ''Sangharsh Ma Gujarat'' (''In The Struggles of Gujarat''), describing events during the Emergency.<ref name="Aakar-PoetModi">{{cite web|last=Patel |first=Aakar |title=The poetic side of Narendra Modi |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/131222/commentary-columnists/commentary/poetic-side-narendra-modi |website=Deccan Chronicle |accessdate=23 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524050207/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/131222/commentary-columnists/commentary/poetic-side-narendra-modi |archivedate=24 May 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Gujarat-not-enamoured-by-poet-Narendra-Modi/articleshow/757261.cms|title=Gujarat not enamoured by poet Narendra Modi|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=28 June 2004|accessdate=17 October 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023124625/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Gujarat-not-enamoured-by-poet-Narendra-Modi/articleshow/757261.cms|archivedate=23 October 2015}}</ref> Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist [[George Fernandes]], as well as several other national political figures.{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=38–43, 46–50}} In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a [[Sikh]].{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=38–43}}

As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and [[small government]], which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 [[Vibrant Gujarat]] summit, real-estate investment deals worth {{INR|link=Indian rupee}}6.6&nbsp;trillion were signed.<ref name="Phadnis BS" />

The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects.

Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure.

{{Further|2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election}}
Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.<ref name="India Review" /> He did, however, maintain relations with [[Dawoodi Bohra]].<ref name="India Review" /> His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the [[Death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh|killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh]].

The BJP election manifesto had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into India in the Northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. The Modi government issued a notification allowing Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to legalise their residency in India. The government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons but it drew criticism from several Assamese organisations.<ref name="Northeast" />

In naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the "Ministry of Environment and Forests" the "Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change."<ref name="Kothari">{{cite journal|last1=Kothari|first1=Ashish|title=A Hundred Days Closer to Ecological and Social Suicide|journal=Economic & Political Weekly|date=27 September 2014|volume=49|issue=39}}</ref> In the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%.<ref name="Kothari" /> The new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. These included no longer requiring clearance from the [[National Board for Wildlife]] for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received.<ref name="Ruparelia" /><ref name="Kothari" /> The government also tried to reconstitute the Wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the Supreme Court.<ref name="Kothari" />

During his premiership various government initiatives were taken to protect endangered wildlife species like Tigers, Elephants and Dolphins.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Basu|first=Mohana|date=15 August 2020|title=After Project Tiger and Project Elephant, India to have Project Dolphin, says PM Modi|url=https://theprint.in/environment/after-project-tiger-and-project-elephant-india-to-have-project-dolphin-says-pm-modi/482450/|access-date=23 November 2020|website=ThePrint|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Bhattacharjee|first=Buddhadeb|title=Narendra Modi's Human Development Mission|publisher=Sankalp Publication|year=|isbn=9788194650669|location=|pages=90—93}}</ref> Modi in November 2015 launched the [[International Solar Alliance]] in [[India–Africa Forum Summit]] for better solar power utilization.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Staff|first=Reuters|date=29 November 2015|title=France, India to launch global solar alliance|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/climatechange-summit-solar-idINKBN0TI0QR20151129|access-date=23 November 2020}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating.<ref name="Ruparelia" /><ref name="Barry">{{cite news|last1=Barry|first1=Ellen|last2=Bagri|first2=Neha Thirani|title=Narendra Modi, Favoring Growth in India, Pares Back Environmental Rules|work=The New York Times|date=4 December 2014}}</ref> Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas.<ref name="Barry" /> In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries.<ref name="Kothari" /> The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.<ref name="Barry" />

Under the UPA government that preceded Modi's administration, field trials of [[Genetically modified food|Genetically Modified (GM) crops]] had essentially been put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods.<ref name="GM crops">{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Sanjay|s2cid=4459603|title=India eases stance on GM crop trials|journal=Nature|date=14 May 2015|volume=521|issue=7551|pages=138–139|bibcode=2015Natur.521..138K|doi=10.1038/521138a|pmid=25971488}}</ref> Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted.<ref name="GM crops" /> The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group [[Greenpeace]], citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with Greenpeace's opposition to GM crops.<ref name="GM crops" />
