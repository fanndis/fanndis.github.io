His first Top 40 single was "I Couldn't Say No", a duet with [[Carlene Carter]]. By 1990, Orrall had found success as a songwriter, having penned Number One singles for [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]] and [[Clay Walker]]. He returned to RCA in 1991 and charted the singles "Boom! It Was Over" and "A Little Bit of Her Love", from his first [[country music]] album, ''[[Flying Colors (Robert Ellis Orrall album)|Flying Colors]]''. Orrall then joined frequent songwriting partner [[Curtis Wright]] in the CMA-nominated duo [[Orrall & Wright]], recording one more album and charting two singles. They split up in 1994, however, and Orrall returned to his solo career, writing singles for [[Reba McEntire]], [[Taylor Swift]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]], as well as producing records for Swift, [[Be Your Own Pet]],  and [[Love and Theft (band)|Love and Theft]]. He also performs and records as an [[indie rock]] musician in the band Monkey Bowl.

==Musical career==
===Beginnings===
Born in [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]], Orrall got his musical start playing in various [[Boston, Massachusetts]] area clubs. He signed with RCA in 1980 as a rock artist. His three RCA albums, ''Fixation'', ''Special Pain'' and ''Contain Yourself'' were supported by band mates Kook Lawry on guitar, Don Walden on bass, David Stefanelli on drums and [[Brian Maes]] on keys with tours opening for [[U2]], [[The Kinks]], and [[NRBQ]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://robertellisorrall.com/|title=Robert Ellis Orrall|website=Robertellisorrall.com}}</ref> Orrall's ''Special Pain'' also produced his first chart single in "I Couldn't Say No", a duet with [[Carlene Carter]] (also her first chart hit) which peaked in the Top 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="peer">[https://web.archive.org/web/20020325053836/http://www.peermusic.com/artistpage/Robert_Ellis_Orrall.html] </ref> Carter, like Orrall, would eventually become a country music star in her own right.

===Nashville===
Orrall eventually gained an interest in country music through such acts as [[Steve Earle]], [[Lyle Lovett]], and [[Foster & Lloyd]].<ref name="peer"/> He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]],<ref name="oldies">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Robert-Ellis-Orrall.html|title=Robert Ellis Orrall|website=Oldies.com}}</ref> intending to use his songwriting and record producing skills.<ref name="peer"/> One of his first cuts was [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]]'s "[[Next to You, Next to Me]]", which Orrall co-wrote with [[Curtis Wright]].<ref name="oldies"/>

Shortly after his song topped the charts, Orrall's publisher BMG Music urged him to perform his songs at The Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. He was then offered a second record deal with RCA.<ref name="peer"/> Titled ''[[Flying Colors (Robert Ellis Orrall album)|Flying Colors]]'', Orrall's first country album produced three charting singles, including a Top 20 in "Boom! It Was Over", as well as "A Little Bit of Her Love" and "Every Day When I Get Home". In 1993, [[Clay Walker]] reached Number One on the country charts with Orrall's "[[What's It to You]]", another Wright co-write.
