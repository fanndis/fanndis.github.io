'''Digital media''' means any [[Media (communication)|media]] that are encoded in [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] formats. Digital media can be created, viewed, distributed, modified and preserved on [[digital electronics]] devices. Digital can be defined as any data represented with a series of digits, and Media refers to a method of broadcasting or communicating information. Together, digital media refers to any information that is broadcast to us through a screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecdm.ca/news/what-is-digital-media|title=What is Digital Media?|last=Smith|first=Richard|date=2013-10-15|website=The Centre for Digital Media|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> This includes text, audio, video, and graphics that is transmitted over the internet, for viewing on the internet.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rayburn|first=Dan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yC_4xW63Je0C&q=digital+media+definition&pg=PT310|title=Streaming and Digital Media: Understanding the Business and Technology|date=2012-07-26|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-136-03217-2|language=en}}</ref>

==Digital media ==
Examples of digital media include [[software]], [[digital images]], [[digital video]], [[video games]], [[web pages]] and [[websites]], [[social media]], [[digital data]] and [[databases]], [[digital audio]] such as [[MP3]], [[electronic document]]s and [[electronic books]]. Digital media often contrasts with [[print media]], such as printed [[books]], [[newspapers]] and [[magazines]], and other traditional or analog media, such as [[photographic film]], [[audio tapes]] or [[video tapes]].

Digital media has had a significantly broad and complex impact on society and culture. Combined with the [[Internet]] and [[personal computing]], digital media has caused [[disruptive innovation]] in publishing, journalism, public relations, entertainment, education, commerce and politics. Digital media has also posed new challenges to [[copyright]] and intellectual property laws, fostering an [[open content]] movement in which [[Content creation|content creators]] voluntarily give up some or all of their legal rights to their work. The ubiquity of digital media and its effects on society suggest that we are at the start of a new era in industrial history, called the [[Information Age]], perhaps leading to a [[paperless society]] in which all media are produced and consumed on computers.<ref name=infoage>{{cite web|last=Dewar|first=James A.|title=The information age and the printing press: looking backward to see ahead|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P8014/index2.html#fn0|publisher=RAND Corporation|access-date=29 March 2014|date=1998}}</ref> However, challenges to a digital transition remain, including outdated copyright laws, [[censorship]], the [[digital divide]], and the spectre of a [[digital dark age]], in which older media becomes inaccessible to new or upgraded information systems.<ref name=darkage>{{cite news|last=Koehl|first=Sean|title=We need to act now to prevent a digital 'dark age'|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/05/we-need-to-act-to-prevent-a-digital-dark-age/|access-date=29 March 2014|newspaper=Wired|date=15 May 2013}}</ref> Digital media has a significant, wide-ranging and complex impact on society and culture.<ref name=infoage />

==History==
Codes and information by machines were first conceptualized by [[Charles Babbage]] in the early 1800s. Babbage imagined that these codes would give him instructions for his Motor of Difference and Analytical Engine, machines that Babbage had designed to solve the problem of error in calculations.
Between 1822 and 1823, [[Ada Lovelace]], mathematics, wrote the first instructions for calculating numbers on Babbage engines. Lovelace's instructions are now believed to be the first computer program.
Although the machines were designed to perform analysis tasks, Lovelace anticipated the possible social impact of computers and programming, writing. "For in the distribution and combination of truths and formulas of analysis, which may become easier and more quickly subjected to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relationships and the nature of many subjects in which science necessarily relates in new subjects, and more deeply researched […] there are in all extensions of human power or additions to human knowledge, various collateral influences, in addition to the primary and primary object reached." Other old machine readable media include instructions for pianolas and [[weaving]] machines.

==="As We May Think"===
While digital media did not come into common use until the late 20th century, the ''conceptual'' foundation of digital media is traced to the work of scientist and engineer [[Vannevar Bush]] and his celebrated essay "[[As We May Think]]," published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in 1945.<ref name=symposium>{{cite news|last=Simpson|first=Rosemary|title=50 years after "As We May Think": the Brown/MIT Vannevar Bush symposium|url=http://cs.brown.edu/~rms/50YearsAfter.pdf|access-date=29 March 2014|newspaper=Interactions|date=March 1996|author2=Allen Renear|author3=Elli Mylonas|author4=Andries van Dam|pages=47–67}}</ref> Bush envisioned a system of devices that could be used to help scientists, doctors, historians and others, store, analyze and communicate information.<ref name=symposium /> Calling this then-imaginary device a "[[memex]]", Bush wrote:
<blockquote>The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.<ref name=AWMT>{{cite news|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|title=As We May Think|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true|access-date=29 March 2014|newspaper=The Atlantic Monthly|date=1 July 1945}}</ref></blockquote>
Bush hoped that the creation of this memex would be the work of scientists after World War II.<ref name=AWMT /> Though the essay predated digital computers by several years, "As We May Think," anticipated the potential social and intellectual benefits of digital media and provided the conceptual framework for [[digital scholarship]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[wiki]]s and even [[social media]].<ref name=symposium /><ref>{{cite web|last=Mynatt|first=Elizabeth|title=As we may think: the legacy of computing research and the power of human cognition|url=http://www.cra.org/ccc/component/content/article/309-as-we-may-think-the-legacy-of-computing-research-and-the-power-of-human-cognition|publisher=Computing Research Association|access-date=30 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407053914/http://www.cra.org/ccc/component/content/article/309-as-we-may-think-the-legacy-of-computing-research-and-the-power-of-human-cognition|archive-date=7 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was recognized as a significant work even at the time of its publication.<ref name=AWMT />

===Disruption in industry===
Compared with [[print media]], the [[mass media]], and other analog technologies, digital media are easy to copy, store, share and modify. This quality of digital media has led to significant changes in many industries, especially journalism, publishing, education, entertainment, and the music business. The overall effect of these changes is so far-reaching that it is difficult to quantify. For example, in movie-making, the transition from analog [[film]] cameras to digital cameras is nearly complete.

In academia, digital media has led to a new form of scholarship, also called [[digital scholarship]], making [[open access]] and [[open science]] possible thanks to the low cost of distribution. New fields of study have grown, such as [[digital humanities]] and [[digital history]]. It has changed the way libraries are used and their role in society.<ref name="aclib" /> Every major media, communications and academic endeavor is facing a period of transition and uncertainty related to digital media.

Over the years [[YouTube]] has grown to become a website with user generated media. This content is oftentimes not mediated by any company or agency, leading to a wide array of personalities and opinions online. Over the years YouTube and other platforms have also shown their monetary gains, as the top 10 YouTube performers generating over 10 million dollars each year. Many of these YouTube profiles over the years have a multi camera set up as we would see on TV. Many of these creators also creating their own digital companies as their personalities grow. Personal devices have also seen an increase over the years.

[[User-generated content]] raises issues of privacy, credibility, civility and compensation for cultural, intellectual and artistic contributions.

Over the last decade the concept of fair use has been applied to many online medias.

Copyright challenges have gotten to all parts of digital media. Even as a personal content creator on YouTube, they must be careful and follow the guidelines set by copyright and IP laws. As YouTube creators very easily get demonetized for their content.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators|title=The golden age of YouTube is over|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=2019-04-05|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref> Oftentimes we see digital creators loose monetization in their content, get their contend deleted, or get criticized for their content. Most times this has to do with accidnelty using a copyrighted audio track or background scenes that are copyright by another company.<ref name=":1" />

To resolve some of these issues, content creators can voluntarily adopt [[Open license|open]] or [[copyleft]] licenses, giving up some of their legal rights, or they can release their work to the [[public domain]]. Among the most common open licenses are [[Creative Commons]] licenses and the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], both of which are in use on [[Wikipedia]]. Open licenses are part of a broader [[open content]] movement that pushes for the reduction or removal of copyright restrictions from software, data and other digital media.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=Andrew|title=The open-content movement|url=http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2008/10/20/02wiki.h02.html|access-date=30 March 2014|newspaper=Digital Directions|date=17 October 2008}}</ref>
To facilitate the collection and consumption of such licensing information and availability status, tools have been developed like the [[Creative Commons]] Search engine (mostly for images on the web) and [[Unpaywall]] (for [[scholarly communication]]).

Additional software has been developed in order to restrict access to digital media. [[digital rights management]] (DRM) is used to lock material and allows users to use that media for specific cases. For example, DRM allows a movie producer to rent a movie at a lower price than selling the movie, restricting the movie rental license length, rather than only selling the movie at full price. Additionally, DRM can prevent unauthorized sharing or modification of media.

Digital Media is numerical, networked and interactive system of links and databases that allows us to navigate from one bit of content or webpage to another.

One form of digital media that is becoming a phenomenon is in the form of an [[online magazine]] or digital magazine. What exactly is a digital magazine? Due to the economic importance of digital magazines, the Audit Bureau of Circulations integrated the definition of this medium in its latest report (March 2011): a digital magazine involves the distribution of a magazine content by electronic means; it may be a replica.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite conference|last1=Santos Silva|first1=Dora|conference=ELPUB - 16th International Conference on Electronic Publishing|book-title=Social Shaping of Digital Publishing: Exploring the Interplay Between Culture and Technology|editor-last=Baptista|editor-first=A.A.|date=June 14{{ndash}}15, 2012|location=Guimarães, Portugal|url=http://elpub.scix.net/data/works/att/109_elpub2012.content.pdf|title=The Future of Digital Magazine Publishing|access-date=21 November 2014|display-editors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123133735/http://elpub.scix.net/data/works/att/109_elpub2012.content.pdf|archive-date=23 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> This is an outdated definition of what a digital magazine is. A digital magazine should not be, in fact, a replica of the print magazine in PDF, as was common practice in recent years. It should, rather, be a magazine that is, in essence, interactive and created from scratch to a digital platform (Internet, mobile phones, private networks, iPad or other device).<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The barriers for digital magazine distribution are thus decreasing. At the same time digitizing platforms are broadening the scope of where digital magazines can be published, such as within websites and on smartphones.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Ryan|title=Are Digital Magazines Dead|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/are-digital-magazines-dead/|website=WWW.wired.com|access-date=21 November 2014}}</ref>
