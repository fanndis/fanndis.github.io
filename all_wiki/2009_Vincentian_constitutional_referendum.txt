{{Politics of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines}}

A constitutional referendum was held in [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] on 25 November 2009.<ref name=Caribnn>{{cite news|title=CARICOM Secretariat team to observe St Vincent and the Grenadines referendum |url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-19839--15-15--.html |publisher=Caribbean Net News |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=14 November 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}</ref> Voters were asked whether they approved of a new constitution which would have replaced the constitution in force since independence in 1979.<ref name=Tandte>{{cite news|last=Browne |first=Juhel |title=Gonsalves: No executive president for St. Vincent |url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=161555837 |newspaper=Trinidad and Tobago Express |date=11 November 2009 |accessdate=14 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113082735/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=161555837 |archivedate=November 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=Const>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom| publication-date=26 July 1979| title=Constitution of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines| series=50.1| publication-place=Kingstown| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Vincent/stvincent79.html| accessdate=26 November 2009}}</ref> The proposal was supported by only 43.13% of voters in the referendum, well short of the required two-thirds threshold. If approved, the proposed constitution would have abolished the [[monarchy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], headed by Queen [[Elizabeth II]],<ref name=Const /> and would have given more power to the opposition.<ref name=Tandte /> The referendum was the first of its kind to be held by a member of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]].<ref name=Caribnn />

==Campaign==

[[Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Prime Minister]] [[Ralph Gonsalves]] and his [[Unity Labour Party]] (ULP) campaigned heavily for the "Yes" vote,<ref name=Caribbean360>{{cite news| title=CARICOM observers for St Vincent Constitution referendum| url=http://www.caribbean360.com/News/Caribbean/Stories/2009/11/13/NEWS0000009461.html| publisher=Caribbean 360| date=13 November 2009| accessdate=14 November 2009}}</ref> Gonsalves advocating that, though he had nothing personally against Queen Elizabeth II, he believed it was time for Saint Vincent to stop having a monarch as its head of state; he offered the opinion: "I find it a bit of [[Anansi|a Nancy story]] that the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of England]] {{sic}} can really be the [[Monarchy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Queen of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]."<ref name=Tandte /> Though he had earlier shown affinity towards [[executive presidency|executive presidents]] [[Hugo Chávez]] and [[Fidel Castro]],<ref>{{Citation|last=Johnson |first=Andy |title=St Vincent leader's constitutional reform in danger |newspaper=Trinidad and Tobago Express |date=26 November 2009 |url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=161562550 |accessdate=26 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127191021/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=161562550 |archivedate=November 27, 2009 }}</ref> Gonsalves asserted that the proposed constitution for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines would not have created such a presidential post; the Prime Minister argued that an executive presidency would give the office holder too much power in the small country. In an interview with the ''[[Trinidad and Tobago Express]]'', he stated that type of presidency "may well make perfect sense" for the neighbouring country of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], but such a government would not work in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, saying further: "it is our assessment that to conjoin the power of a prime minister with the power of a [[head of state]], [[head of government]], or head of state in our circumstances, that is a matter which will end up making that office holder more powerful than the current situation."<ref name=Tandte />

Opposition to the constitutional changes was led by the [[New Democratic Party (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), which held the position that the proposed constitution would neither reduce the power of the prime minister nor strengthen the country's [[democracy]].<ref name=Caribbean360 /> The NDP's leader, [[Arnhim Eustace]], opined that the Gonsalves government and opposition parties had not come to an agreement on a number of fundamental issues, including the Integrity Commission, the [[Human Rights Commission]], the [[Ombudsman]], and the Electoral and Boundaries Commission.<ref name=Caribbean360 />

The [[CARICOM]] [[Secretariat of the Caribbean Community|Secretariat]] announced that it would, at the request of the government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, officially observe the referendum, with the support of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development (AECID), an agency of the government of [[Spain]].<ref name=Caribnn /><ref name=Caribbean360 />

==Conduct==

Voting took place in heavy rain, with 52,262 of the 97,724 eligible Vincentiens casting ballots at 225 polling stations. The Supervisor of Elections opined that this was a good turn-out given the inclement weather.<ref>{{Citation| last=Trotman| first=Jeff| title=NO...
