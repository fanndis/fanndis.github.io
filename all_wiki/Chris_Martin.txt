Martin, along with the other Coldplay members, achieved worldwide fame with the release of the band's song "[[Yellow (Coldplay song)|Yellow]]" in 2000, a song that also earned the band their first [[Grammy Award]] nomination in the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]]. The band then received [[List of awards and nominations received by Coldplay|accolades]] for their subsequent albums including ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]'' and ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends|Viva la Vida]]'', winning a Grammy Award for both and a [[The Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for the former.

==Influences and favourite musicians==
The main influence on Martin and Coldplay is the Scottish rock band [[Travis (band)|Travis]], with Martin crediting the band for the creation of his own band.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/martin-travis-invented-coldplay_1019613 |title=Chris Martin &#124; Martin: 'Travis Invented Coldplay' |magazine=Contactmusic |date=20 January 2007 |access-date=14 January 2012}}</ref>

The Irish rock band [[U2]] is another important influence on Martin both musically and politically.<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite web|title=The Immortals: The First Fifty|work=Rolling Stone Issue 946|publisher=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5940051/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_22_u2 |access-date=21 December 2006}}</ref> Martin wrote for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ''Magazine'''s "100 Greatest Artists of All Time" on the band,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/|title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time|access-date=22 March 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> saying: "I don't buy weekend tickets to Ireland and hang out in front of their gates, but U2 are the only band whose entire catalogue I know by heart. The first song on ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'', "[[A Sort of Homecoming (U2 song)|A Sort of Homecoming]]", I know backward and forward—it's so rousing, brilliant, and beautiful. It's one of the first songs I played to my unborn baby." Martin also comments on [[Bono]]'s effect on his own charity and political involvement; he is even known to joke with friends referring to himself as "Crono".<ref name="rollingstone" />

Martin and Coldplay were also greatly influenced by the English rock band [[Radiohead]]. Speaking to ''Rolling Stone Magazine'', Martin said of Radiohead: "Sometimes I feel like they cleared a path with a machete, and we came afterward and put up a strip mall... I would still give my left ball to write anything as good as ''[[OK Computer]]''."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-coldplay-to-radiohead-connection-a-video-investigation-20080617 |title=Chris Martin &#124; The Coldplay to Radiohead Connection: A Video Investigation' |magazine=Rolling Stone|date=17 June 2008 |access-date=25 April 2014}}</ref>

Martin is very vocal about his love for Norwegian [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[Synthpop]] band [[a-ha]]. In 2005 he stated the following in an interview: "I found myself in [[Amsterdam]] the other day and I put a-ha's first record on. I just remembered how much I loved it. It's incredible songwriting. Everyone asks what inspired us, what we've been trying to steal from and what we listened to as we were growing up—the first band I ever loved was a-ha."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/martin-im-a-big-fan-of-aha|title=Martin: 'I'm A Big Fan Of A-Ha'}}</ref> Martin has also performed live together with [[Magne Furuholmen]] of a-ha, introducing him as "the best keyboard player in the world".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzFfQhUvJ_0|title=Coldplay&nbsp;– Hunting High and Low (Chris Martin and Mags)|work=youtube.com|access-date=20 September 2008}}</ref> In November 2011, he stated that "back when we didn't have any hits of our own we used to play a-ha songs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/11/24/kultur/musikk/konsert/coldplay/19142941|title=Vi kjente at noen av de nye låtene virkelig fant sin liveform&nbsp;– kultur|publisher=Dagbladet.no|date=24 November 2011|access-date=2 January 2012}}</ref>
