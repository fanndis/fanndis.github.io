'''''Slate''''' is an online magazine that covers current affairs, politics, and culture in the United States. It is known, and sometimes criticized, for having adopted [[contrarian]] views, giving rise to the term "Slate Pitches".<ref>{{cite news |title= Contrarianism's end? |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2009/10/contrarianisms_end_1 |newspaper= [[The Economist]] |date= October 19, 2009}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite magazine |last= Weisberg |first= Jacob |title= What Makes Slate Slatey? |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/slates_10th_anniversary/2006/06/what_makes_slate_slatey.single.html |magazine= Slate |date= June 19, 2006 |quote= To be a Slatey writer, you must cut through the media welter [...] This can be done in a number of ways.

It was created in 1996 by former ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' editor [[Michael Kinsley]], initially under the ownership of [[Microsoft]] as part of [[MSN]]. In 2004, it was purchased by [[Graham Holdings|The Washington Post Company]] (later renamed the Graham Holdings Company), and since 2008 has been managed by [[The Slate Group]], an online publishing entity created by Graham Holdings. ''Slate'' is based in New York City, with an additional office in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web |title= Slate Magazine: Private Company Information - Businessweek |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=8200230 |publisher= Bloomberg.com |access-date= July 2, 2015}}</ref>

''Slate'', which is updated throughout the day, covers politics, arts and culture, sports, and news. According to its former editor-in-chief [[Julia Turner (journalist)|Julia Turner]], the magazine is "not fundamentally a breaking news source", but rather aimed at helping readers to "analyze and understand and interpret the world" with witty and entertaining writing.<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url= http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/09/8553356/long-serving-deputy-julia-turner-takes-reins-slate |title= Long-serving deputy Julia Turner takes the reins at Slate |last= Levy |first= Nicole |date= September 30, 2014 |work= [[Politico|Capital New York]] |access-date= September 30, 2014}}</ref> As of mid-2015, it publishes about 1,500 stories per month.<ref name=":4">{{cite web |title= Unlimited FAQ |url= https://secure.slate.com/unlimited |work= Slate |access-date= July 2, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150703071551/https://secure.slate.com/unlimited |archive-date= July 3, 2015 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

A French version, ''slate.fr'', was launched in February 2009 by a group of four journalists, including [[Jean-Marie Colombani]], Eric Leser, and economist [[Jacques Attali]]. Among them, the founders hold 50 percent in the publishing company, while The Slate Group holds 15 percent.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/15/paidcontent/main4803947.shtml |work= [[CBS News]] |title= Interview: Jacob Weisberg, Chairman, Slate Group: Breaking Out of the Beltway |date= February 15, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-technologie-internet/2009-02-11/slate-fr-jean-marie-colombani-a-l-assaut-du-web/1387/0/315818 |title= Slate.fr: Jean-Marie Colombani à l'assaut du Web, actualité Tech & Net – Le Point |magazine= [[Le Point]] |date= February 10, 2009 |access-date= April 28, 2013| language= French}}</ref> In 2011, ''slate.fr'' started a separate site covering African news, ''Slate Afrique'', with a Paris-based editorial staff.<ref>{{cite web |title= Slate Afrique |url= http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/source-profile/2135951-slate-afrique |access-date= July 2, 2015 |publisher= VoxEurop |date= June 20, 2012}}</ref>

It is ad-supported and has been available to read free of charge since 1999, but restricted access for non-US readers via a [[metered paywall]] in 2015.

==Background==
''Slate'' features regular and semi-regular columns such as ''Explainer, Moneybox, Spectator, Transport'', and ''[[Dear Prudence (advice column)|Dear Prudence]]''. Many of the articles are short (less than 2,000 words) and argument-driven. Around 2010, the magazine also began running long-form journalism. Many of the longer stories are an outgrowth of the "Fresca Fellowships", so-called because former editor Plotz liked the soft drink [[Fresca]]. "The idea is that every writer and editor on staff has to spend a month or six weeks a year not doing their regular job, but instead working on a long, ambitious project of some sort," Plotz said in an interview.<ref>{{cite web |last=Levy |first=Dan |date= April 4, 2011 |title=Slate of Mind: Q&A with David Plotz |url= http://sparksheet.com/slate-of-mind-qa-with-david-plotz/ |work=Sparksheet |accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref>

''Slate'' introduced a [[paywall]]-based business model in 1998 that attracted up 20,000 subscribers but was later abandoned.<ref name=":5">{{cite news |last= Sawers |first= Paul |date= June 8, 2015 |title= Slate slides behind a metered paywall as global readers are asked to pay $5/month|url= https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/08/slate-slides-behind-a-paywall-as-global-readers-are-asked-to-pay-5month-to-read-more-than-5-articles/ |work=[[VentureBeat]] |accessdate= July 2, 2015}}</ref> A similar subscription model was implemented in April 2001 by ''Slate''{{'}}s independently owned competitor, [[Salon.com]].

''Slate'' started a daily feature, "Today's Pictures", on November 30, 2005, which featured 15–20 photographs from the archive at [[Magnum Photos]] that share a common theme. The column also features two [[Flash animation|Flash animated]] "Interactive Essays" a month.

[[File:Slate screenshot.png|thumb|right|The design of ''Slate''{{'}}s homepage from 2006 to 2013]]

On its 10th anniversary, ''Slate'' unveiled a redesigned website. It introduced ''Slate V'' in 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.slatev.com/ |title= Home |work= Slate V |accessdate= April 28, 2013}}</ref> an online video magazine with content that relates to or expands upon their written articles. In 2013, the magazine was redesigned under the guidance of Design Director [[Vivian Selbo]].

''Slate'' was nominated for four digital [[National Magazine Awards]] in 2011 and won the [[American society of magazine editors#National Magazine Awards|NMA]] for General Excellence. In the same year, the magazine laid off several high-profile journalists, including co-founder [[Jack Shafer]] and [[Timothy Noah]] (author of the ''Chatterbox'' column).<ref name=":6">{{cite news |title= Slate magazine lays off Jack Shafer, Timothy Noah |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/slate-magazine-lays-off-jack-shafer-timothy-noah/2011/08/24/gIQAtCCgcJ_story.html |newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] |date= August 24, 2011 |accessdate= July 12, 2015 |issn= 0190-8286 |language= en|last= Farhi |first= Paul}}</ref> At the time, it had around 40 full-time editorial staff.<ref name=":6" /> The following year, a dedicated ad sales team was created.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Slate' Gets a New Publisher |url= http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/slate-gets-new-publisher-143124 |accessdate= July 12, 2015 |work= [[Adweek]] |date= August 27, 2012}}</ref>

''Slate'' launched the "Slate Book Review" in 2012, a monthly books section edited by Dan Kois.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/business/media/slate-to-begin-a-monthly-review-of-books.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130227193805/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/business/media/slate-to-begin-a-monthly-review-of-books.html |archivedate= February 27, 2013 |title= Slate to Begin a Monthly Review of Books |date= March 1, 2012 |last= Bosman |first= Julie |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |access-date= April 28, 2013}}</ref>

The next year, ''Slate'' became profitable after preceding years had seen layoffs and falling ad revenues.<ref name=":0" />

In 2014, ''Slate'' introduced a [[paywall system]] called "Slate Plus", offering ad-free podcasts and bonus materials. A year later, it had attracted 9,000 subscribers generating about $500,000 in annual revenue.<ref name=":5" />

''Slate'' moved all content behind a [[metered paywall]] for international readers in June 2015, explaining "our U.S.-based sales team sells primarily to domestic advertisers, many of whom only want to reach a domestic audience. ...The end result is that, outside the United States, we are not covering our costs."<ref>{{cite news |title= Hello, International Reader|url= http://www.slate.com/articles/briefing/slate_fare/2015/06/slate_s_new_international_paywall_how_it_will_work_for_readers_abroad.html |work= Slate |date= June 7, 2015 |accessdate= June 7, 2015 |issn= 1091-2339 |last= Turner |first= Julia}}</ref> At the same time, it was stated that there were no plans for a domestic paywall.<ref name=":4" />

Slate's articles have presented news and opinions from a liberal perspective, eventually evolving into a self-proclaimed liberal news site.

=== Reputation for counterintuitive arguments ("Slate pitches") ===
Since 2006,<ref name=":1" /> ''Slate'' has been known for publishing [[contrarian]] pieces arguing against commonly held views about a subject, giving rise to the #slatepitches Twitter [[hashtag]] in 2009.<ref name=":2" /> The ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' has defined ''Slate'' [[Sales Pitch|pitches]] as "an idea that sounds wrong or counterintuitive proposed as though it were the tightest logic ever," and in explaining its success wrote "Readers want to click on Slate Pitches because they want to know what a writer could possibly say that would support their logic".<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/trolling_readers.php |title= Stop trolling your readers|date= October 16, 2014 |access-date= October 16, 2014 |magazine= [[Columbia Journalism Review]] |last= Goldenberg |first= Kira}}</ref>

In 2014, ''Slate''{{'}}s then editor-in-chief Julia Turner acknowledged a reputation for counterintuitive arguments forms part of ''Slate''<nowiki/>'s "distinctive" brand, but argued that the hashtag misrepresents the site's journalism. "We are not looking to argue that up is down and black is white for the sake of being contrarian against all logic or intellectual rigor. But journalism is more interesting when it surprises you either with the conclusions that it reaches or the ways that it reaches them."<ref name=":0" />

In a 2019 article for the site, ''Slate'' contributor Daniel Engber reflected on the changes that had occurred on the site since he started writing for it 15 years previously.  He suggested that its original worldview, influenced by its founder Kinsley and described by Engber as "feisty, surprising, debate-club centrist-by-default" and "liberal contrarianism", had shifted towards "a more reliable, left-wing slant", whilst still giving space for heterodox opinions, albeit "tempered by other, graver duties". He argued that this was necessary within the context of a "Manichean age of flagrant cruelty and corruption", although he also acknowledged that it could be "a troubling limitation".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/quillette-claire-lehmann-intellectual-dark-web.html |title=Free Thought for the Closed-Minded |last=Engber |first=Daniel |date=8 January 2019 |website=Slate (magazine) |access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref>

==Podcasts==
{{see also|Panoply Media}}

According to NiemanLab, ''Slate'' has been involved in [[podcast]]s "almost from the very beginning" of the medium.<ref name="NJLab" /> Its first podcast offering, released on July 15, 2005,<ref>{{cite web |title= Slate's Podcasting Guide |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/podcasts/2005/07/slates_podcasting_guide.html |website= Slate|accessdate= August 3, 2012}}</ref> featured selected stories from the site read by Andy Bowers, who had joined ''Slate'' after leaving [[NPR]] in 2003.<ref name="NJLab">{{cite web |website= [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]]|title=Slate doubles down on podcasts, courting niche audiences and happy advertisers |url= http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/06/slate-doubles-down-on-podcasts-courting-niche-audiences-and-happy-advertisers/ |last= Phelps |first= Andrew |date= June 4, 2012 |accessdate= April 28, 2013}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{cite news |url= http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/02/slates-podcast-audience-has-tripled-in-a-year-and-its-bet-on-audio-over-video-continues-to-pay-off/ |title= Slate’s podcast audience has tripled in a year, and its bet on audio over video continues to pay off |last= Owens |first= Simon |date= February 6, 2015 |work= [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism|NiemanLab]] |accessdate= February 6, 2015}}</ref> By June 2012, ''Slate'' had expanded their lineup to 19 podcasts, with ''Political Gabfest'' and ''Culture Gabfest'' being the most popular.<ref name="NJLab" /> This count had shrunk to 14 by February 2015, with all receiving six million downloads per month.<ref name=":3" /> The podcasts are "a profitable part of [''Slate'''s] business"; the magazine charges more for advertising in its podcasts than in any of its other content.<ref name="NJLab" />
