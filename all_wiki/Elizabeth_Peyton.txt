'''Elizabeth Joy Peyton''' (born 1965) is an [[United States|American]] contemporary artist working primarily in painting, drawing, and printmaking. Best known for figures from her own life and those beyond it, including close friends, historical personae, and icons of contemporary culture, Peyton’s [[Portrait|portraits]] have regularly featured artists, writers, musicians, and actors.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Danbury, Connecticut]] in 1965, Peyton began drawing and painting people at a young age.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/apr/08/artist-elizabeth-peyton | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jessica | last=Lack | title=Artist of the week 36: Elizabeth Peyton | date=2009-04-08}}</ref> Between 1984 and 1987, she studied fine arts at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in [[New York City]].

==Work==
Peyton’s artwork, mainly figurative, can be characterized by a coupling of understatement and intensity, depicting subjects from her own life and beyond with both startling immediacy and her signature richly modulated surfaces.<ref>Karen Rosenberg (July 11, 2008), [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/arts/design/11peyt.html A Painter's Social Network, Traced in Her Photographs] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu/news/5121|title=Ghost: Elizabeth Peyton {{!}} Kemper Art Museum|website=www.kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> Peyton draws much inspiration from the creative work of historical figures like [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[John Singer Sargent]], and she has expressed that she is part of a lineage of artists and writers like [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Camille Claudel]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Isa Genzken]], [[Giorgione]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe|Georgia O’Keefe]], etc. who look at subjects and portray them with an economy of expression to unite passive sensation with emotion.<ref>[http://www.sadiecoles.com/elizabeth_peyton/press.html Elizabeth Peyton, 30 April - 30 May 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107065207/http://www.sadiecoles.com/elizabeth_peyton/press.html |date=7 January 2011}} Sadie Coles HQ, London.</ref><ref>Bell, Kirsty.“Peyton After Peyton: On Reality and Archetype,” ''Dark Incandescence'', New York: Rizzoli, 2017.</ref> 

Peyton works from both life and photography, generally using painting, drawing, or printmaking, and often exploring successive degrees of removal from her source material, such as in her paintings of Camille Claudel’s sculptures in which Peyton creates paintings of photographs of sculptures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villamedici.it/en/exhibits/eternal-idol-elizabeth-peyton-camille-claudel/|title=Eternal Idol, Elizabeth Peyton - Camille Claudel|website=Villa Medici|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In her interview with [[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]] magazine, Peyton expressed that when she chooses to paint from another artist’s work, it allows her to explore “harder-to-reach things inside herself” because the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is already decided.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/elizabeth-peyton-historic-portraits|title=Elizabeth Peyton on Historic Portraits|website=Frieze|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In another manner of reworking, Peyton will revisit an image that she has previously used, cropping it in different dimensions and thus altering the amount of context given. This manipulation of context is significant to Peyton because of its effect on the feelings of proximity and intimacy. 

Since 1998, when ''[[Parkett]]'' magazine commissioned her to create a lithograph, Peyton has created a broad range of prints, including monotypes, lithographs, and woodcuts.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=69245 ''Bosie'' (1998)] MoMA, New York.</ref> Experimenting with different techniques, she also uses a variety of diverse and handmade papers as well as various colored and monochromatic inks.

In addition to portraits, Peyton also produces work that engages with the [[Still life|still-life]] tradition, often featuring cropped portraits in complex compositions with flowers, statuary, and other motifs associated with the genre. This exploration, beginning around 2007, represented a reorientation of attention from the figure to the broader context of the individual’s environment and the expression of feelings. Examples featured in Peyton’s 2017 ''Dark Incandescence'' [[monograph]] include ''Pati'' (2007), ''Balzac + Roses'' (2008), ''Flaubert + Madame Bovary (Elephants)'' (2008), ''Camille Claudel and Flowers (Still Life)'' (2009), ''Actaeon, Justin Bieber and Grey Roses'' (2010), ''Flowers, Lichtenstein, Parsifal'' (2011), ''Berlin, Hyacinth and Black Teapot'' (2014), and ''Universe of the World-Breath'' (2018).<ref>[http://www.hatjecantz.de/en/collectorseditions/detail.php?titzif=09202797 Collector's Edition: Elizabeth Peyton - Camille Claudel Flowers and Books] Hatje Cantz Publishing, Ostfildern.</ref><ref>[http://www.gladstonegallery.com/exhibition/9596/press Elizabeth Peyton: Dark Incandescence, November 18, 2014 - January 16, 2015] [[Barbara Gladstone]], Brussels.</ref>

In 2009, Peyton collaborated with [[Matthew Barney]] on ''Blood of Two'', an art project on the Greek island of [[Hydra island|Hydra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artreview.com/forum/topic/show?id=1474022:Topic:864997|title=ArtReview|first=Site|last=name|website=www.artreview.com}}</ref> She later worked with [[Jonathan Horowitz]] on a series of monotypes which develop upon the concepts of plants and flowers as motifs of love and death, resulting in a series of paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures and photographs, as well as a collaborative artists book.<ref>[http://www.sadiecoles.com/artists/various/secret-life/index.html Secret Life, 7 June - 25 August 2012] [[Sadie Coles HQ]], London congratulations you made it to the end .</ref>

==Exhibitions==
One of Peyton's first exhibitions in New York City was held in a room of the [[Hotel Chelsea]] (mainly drawings) in 1993.<ref>Calvin Tomkins (October 6, 2008), [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/10/06/the-artist-of-the-portrait The Artist of the Portrait] ''[[The New Yorker Magazine|The New Yorker]]''.</ref> People who wished to see the exhibition would ask the hotel reception for the key to Room 828; [[Calvin Tomkins|Calvin Tompkins]] speculated that about 50 people visited Peyton's drawings of [[Napoleon]], [[Marie Antoinette]], and other portraits of European historical figures, but this show succeeded in bringing her into the public eye.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/01/elizabeth-peyton-art-exhibition-whitechapel | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Purcell | title=Manhattan rhapsodies | date=2009-07-01}}</ref>

A mid-career exhibition of her work started at the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]] in New York City in October 2008, and traveled to the [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis; [[Whitechapel Gallery]], London; and [[Bonnefantenmuseum]], Maastricht (2009–10). This first survey of Peyton's work in an American institution included her latest portraits, which revealed a greater emphasis on the psychology of subjects such as [[Matthew Barney]] and [[John Giorno]]. The day following [[Barack Obama]]'s election to the U.S. presidency, a new painting, created in August 2008, was added to the exhibition, representing [[Michelle Obama]] and her daughter at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>{{citation|author=Maura M Lynch|title=Michelle Obama at the Museum|date=November 2008|url=http://www.wmagazine.com/w/blogs/editorsblog/2008/11/06/yesterday-the-w-magazinecommis.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323041100/http://www.wmagazine.com/w/blogs/editorsblog/2008/11/06/yesterday-the-w-magazinecommis.htm|publisher=W magazine|accessdate=2009-02-19|archivedate=2009-03-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The second in a series of four Ring-inspired shows for [[Metropolitan Opera|Gallery Met]] in 2011, her show ''Wagner'' included works inspired by the composer’s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring cycle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metopera.org/__Redesign/Views/Pages/Error/404.aspx?404;http://www.metopera.org:80/__Redesign/Views/Pages/Error/404.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/metopera/news/features/detail.aspx&id=45316&epslanguage=en|title=Metropolitan Opera - Error 404|publisher=}}</ref> In 2014, she contributed to another Gallery Met show, this time on the subject of [[Alexander Borodin]]'s ''[[Prince Igor]]''.<ref>Carol Vogel (January 16, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/arts/design/dutch-bonanza-for-the-frick.html Operatic Inspiration] ''The New York Times''.</ref> In 2017, the [[Villa Medici]] in Rome exhibited ''Elizabeth Peyton & Camille Claudel: Eternal Idol'' in which works by the artists, born a century apart, are shown alongside each other, creating a dialogue between their distinct approaches to portraiture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.villamedici.it/en/exhibits/eternal-idol-elizabeth-peyton-camille-claudel/|title=Eternal Idol, Elizabeth Peyton - Camille Claudel - Villa Medici|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/154641/elizabeth-peyton-camille-claudeleternal-idol/|title=Elizabeth Peyton & Camille Claudel: Eternal Idol - Announcements - e-flux|website=www.e-flux.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> The same year, [[Hara Museum of Contemporary Art]] presented ''Elizabeth Peyton: Still Life'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art-it.asia/u/HaraMuseum/EfqidXFuato43SHDrU1Y/?lang=en|title="Elizabeth Peyton: Still life" at Hara Museum of Contemporary Art|website=www.art-it.asia}}</ref> the first major survey of Peyton’s art in Japan.
