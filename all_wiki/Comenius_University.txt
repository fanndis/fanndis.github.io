'''Comenius University in Bratislava''' ({{lang-sk|Univerzita Komenského v Bratislave}}) is the largest [[university]] in [[Slovakia]], with most of its faculties located in [[Bratislava]]. It was founded in 1919, shortly after the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]]. It is named after [[John Amos Comenius|Jan Amos Comenius]], a 17th-century [[Czechs|Czech]] teacher and [[philosopher]].

In 2006, Comenius University had more than 30,000 students and 2,000 faculty members. As are most universities in Slovakia, it is funded mostly by the government. Although there have been plans to establish [[tuition]] fees for university students in Slovakia for years, another attempt failed to gain sufficient support in [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|parliament]] in May 2005.

==History==
The Comenius University was established in 1919 with assistance from the more established [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]]. It was meant to replace the former Elisabeth University which was located in Bratislava since 1912 as the latter has been forcefully disbanded in 1919 by [[Samuel Zoch]], plenipotentiary [[župan]] of Slovakia, after Hungarian professors refused to take an oath of allegiance<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> This has caused the majority of the university's professors (and some of the students) to take refuge in [[Budapest]], where the Elisabeth University was reestablished. It has been later moved to [[Pécs]] and renamed to [[University of Pécs]]. This persecution of former (predominantly Hungarian) pillars of education in Bratislava necessitated the recruitment of [[Czech people|Czech]] academicians. Therefore, many [[professor]]s of the newly established university, including its first rector, Prof. MUDr. [[Kristian Hynek]], were Czechs, since Slovakia at that time did not have enough educated [[Slovaks|Slovak]] speakers who could serve as faculty members. In spite of personnel, financial, and space difficulties, the university developed research and teaching programs. The Faculty of Medicine opened in 1919, and was quickly followed by the Faculties of Law and Philosophy in 1921. The Faculty of Philosophy, besides offering programs in the [[humanities]] and [[social science]], also educated much-needed teachers for Slovakia's [[high school]]s.

In 1937, a new university building for the Faculties of Law and Philosophy was opened in the centre of Bratislava. The building includes the Aula (hall) used for graduation ceremonies and other formal functions.

During [[World War II]], Slovakia became nominally a [[First Slovak Republic|republic]], but was actually under the sway of [[Nazi Germany]]. The government reduced [[academic freedom]]s at the university, and the Czech professors were forced out. The university was renamed ''Slovak University'' in 1939, though the original name was reinstated in 1954. The Faculty of Science opened in 1940 and the Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was established in 1941. Academic freedom returned after the end of the war in 1945 but was again cancelled in 1948 as the [[communist]]s took power in [[Czechoslovakia]], enforcing the ideology of [[Marxism-Leninism]] at Czechoslovak universities. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was taken under direct control of the Ministry of Education.

However, the university continued to grow, and new faculties were established (mostly by splitting the existing faculties):
*Faculty of Education in 1946,
*Faculty of Pharmacy in 1952,
*Faculty of Physical Education and Sports in 1960,
*Faculty of Medicine in Martin in 1969,
*[[Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics|Faculty of Mathematics and Physics]] in 1980.

After the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989, the university created a [[democracy|democratic]] self-government, and mandatory courses on [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]] were abolished. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology and the Evangelical Theological Faculty joined the university.

The transformation of Slovakia into a market economy created a need for professionals in management and financial sciences. As a result, the
university established the [[Faculty of Management]] 1991 and the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences in 2002. In 2000, the [[European credit transfer system]] was implemented to improve student mobility and facilitate more ties with other European universities.
