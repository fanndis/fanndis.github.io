'''Bobby Ray Simmons Jr.''' (born November 15, 1988), known professionally as '''B.o.B''', is an American rapper, record producer, and conspiracy theorist from [[Decatur, Georgia]]. In 2006, B.o.B was discovered by Brian Richardson, who then introduced him to TJ Chapman, who subsequently brought him to American record producer [[Jim Jonsin]]. After hearing his music, Jonsin signed B.o.B to his [[Rebel Rock Entertainment]] imprint. Two years later, Jonsin and B.o.B signed a [[joint venture]] deal, with [[Atlantic Records]] and American rapper [[T.I.]]'s [[Grand Hustle Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1348/title.producers-corner-jim-jonsin|title=Producer's Corner: Jim Jonsin|author=|date=May 16, 2009|work=HipHopDX}}</ref>

B.o.B quickly rose to fame after his commercial debut single "[[Nothin' on You]]", reached number one in both the United States and the United Kingdom. He would later release his third single "[[Airplanes (song)|Airplanes]]", which also topped several major music charts. His fifth single "[[Magic (B.o.B song)|Magic]]", became his 3rd top 10 hit on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. B.o.B's debut studio album ''[[B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray|The Adventures of Bobby Ray]]'', which was preceded by two [[extended play]]s (EPs) and several [[mixtape]]s, was released in April 2010. The album reached number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was eventually [[RIAA certification|certified 2× platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2016. B.o.B was named the ninth "[[MTV's Hottest MCs in the Game|Hottest MC in the Game]] of 2010" by [[MTV]], on their annual list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1650275/20101018/bob_7_.jhtml|title=B.o.B Makes His Hottest MCs in the Game Debut At #9!|publisher=MTV News}}</ref>

B.o.B released his second studio album ''[[Strange Clouds (album)|Strange Clouds]]'', in May 2012. The album spawned six singles, four of which charted exceptionally well internationally. The album's [[Strange Clouds (song)|eponymous lead single]] became his fourth top 10 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The singles "[[So Good (B.o.B song)|So Good]]", "[[Both of Us]]" and "[[Out of My Mind (B.o.B song)|Out of My Mind]]", followed behind, with the former two being [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]] by the RIAA. The album itself debuted at number five on the ''Billboard'' 200. His third album ''[[Underground Luxury]]'', was released in December 2013 and supported by the lead single "[[HeadBand]]". In August 2015, B.o.B unexpectedly released a new project ''[[Psycadelik Thoughtz]]'', via digital distribution, with little-to-no promotion.

B.o.B later reflected on his experience, saying, "They've always supported me. They got my first [[Synthesizer|keyboard]] to make beats on and they helped me out getting equipment here and there. But it was kind of hard for them to really understand what I was really trying to accomplish."<ref name="Hip-Hop DX" /> B.o.B attended [[Columbia High School (Decatur, GA)|Columbia High School]] in Decatur, Georgia, where he played the trumpet in the [[school band]], until he landed a record deal and decided to drop out of school in the ninth grade.

In 2002, after meeting his mentor and co-manager B-Rich at the age of 14, B.o.B sold his first [[Hip hop production|beat]] to former [[Slip-n-Slide Records|Slip-n-Slide]] recording artist Citti, for the song "I'm the Cookie Man". B.o.B felt he had established a substantial career. "I went and blew all of my money on fast stuff like a chain and [[wikt:ballin'|ballin']].

In attendance was producer and industry veteran T.J. Chapman, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of TJ's DJ's. Chapman agreed to co-manage B.o.B, which only a month later led to B.o.B's signing with [[Atlantic Records]] and subsidiary imprint Rebel Rock, run by Florida-based producer [[Jim Jonsin]].
