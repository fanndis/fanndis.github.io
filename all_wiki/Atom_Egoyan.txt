His work often explores themes of [[social alienation|alienation]] and [[solitude|isolation]], featuring characters whose interactions are mediated through technology, bureaucracy, or other power structures. Egoyan's films often follow non-linear plot structures, in which events are placed out of sequence in order to elicit specific emotional reactions from the audience by withholding key information.<ref name="faculty"/>

In 2008, Egoyan received the [[Dan David Prize]] for "Creative Rendering of the Past."<ref>[http://www.dandavidprize.org/index.php/laureates/laureates-2008/56-2008-past-creative-rendering-of-the-past-literature-theater-film/72-past-2008-creative-rendering-of-the-past-literature-theater-film.html Dan David Prize Official site, Atom Egoyan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721105038/http://www.dandavidprize.org/index.php/laureates/laureates-2008/56-2008-past-creative-rendering-of-the-past-literature-theater-film/72-past-2008-creative-rendering-of-the-past-literature-theater-film.html |date=July 21, 2011 }}</ref> Egoyan later received the [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Performing Arts Award]], Canada's highest royal honour in the performing arts, in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atom Egoyan - biography|url=http://ggpaa.ca/award-recipients/2015/egoyan,-atom.aspx|website=Governor General's Performing Arts Awards|publisher=Governor General's Performing Arts Awards Foundation|access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref>

He was part of a loosely-affiliated group of filmmakers to emerge in the 1980s from Toronto known as the [[Toronto New Wave]].

==Early life==
Egoyan was born '''Atom Yeghoyan''' ([[Western Armenian|Western]] {{lang-hy|Աթոմ Եղոյեան}}) in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], the son of Shushan (née Devletian) and Joseph Yeghoyan, artists who operated a furniture store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/5/Atom-Egoyan.html |title=Atom Egoyan Biography (1960-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=2015-09-10}}</ref> His parents were [[Armenians|Armenian]]-Egyptians, and he was named Atom to mark the completion of Egypt's first nuclear reactor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Toronto|year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|location=Footscray, Vic., Australia|isbn=9781740598354|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0twBxkXe5DsC&pg=PA28&q=atom%20egoyan%20egypt%20reactor 28]|author=Charles Rawlings-Way, Natalie Karneef|edition=3rd }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ATOM EGOYAN - BIOGRAPHY|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/atom-egoyan/biography/|publisher=[[European Graduate School]]|access-date=25 August 2013|quote=Atom Egoyan's name was a symbolic choice by his parents, named after the new nuclear reactor in Egypt.}}</ref> In 1962, the family moved to Canada, where they settled in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]] and changed their last name to Egoyan. Atom grew up in British Columbia with his sister, [[Eve Egoyan|Eve]], now a concert pianist based in Toronto.<ref>Interview with [[Eleanor Wachtel]] on [[CBC Radio One]]'s programme ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' on February 9, 2010. cf. http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/. Retrieved 2010-02-14.</ref>

As a teenager, he became interested in reading and writing plays. Significant influences included [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Harold Pinter]]. Egoyan also attributes his future in the film industry to [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s film [[Persona (1966 film)|''Persona'']], which he viewed at age fourteen, according to an interview he had with journalist [[Robert K. Elder]] for ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]'':

{{quote|It gave me an incredible respect for the medium and its possibilities. To me, Persona marries a pure form and a very profound vision with absolute conviction. It's very inspiring. I felt that it was able to open a door that wasn't there before.<ref>Egoyan, Atom. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p179. Print.</ref>}}

He graduated from [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. It was at Trinity College that Egoyan came into contact with Harold Nahabedian, the Armenian-Canadian Anglican Chaplain of Trinity College. In interviews Egoyan credited Nahabedian for introducing him to the language and history of his ethnic heritage. Egoyan also wrote for the University of Toronto's independent weekly, ''[[The Newspaper]]'', during his time at the school.

== Career ==
Egoyan began making films in the early 1980s; his debut film ''[[Next of Kin (1984 film)|Next of Kin]]'' (1984) world-premiered at the [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg]] and won a major prize. He directed the Twilight Zone episode 'The Wall' which was first released in 1985. His commercial breakthrough came with the film ''[[Exotica (movie)|Exotica]]'' (1994). He received the [[Grand Prix (Belgian Film Critics Association)]] in [[Brussels]], the [[International Federation of Film Critics#FIPRESCI Award|FIPRESCI Jury Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]] at the [[Canadian Screen Awards]] (then called the [[Genie Awards]]). However, it was Egoyan's first attempt at adapted material that resulted in his best-known work, ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' (1997), which earned him three prizes at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival|50th Cannes Film Festival]]—the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]], the FIPRESCI Jury Prize, and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]]. The film also earned Egoyan [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Adapted Screenplay]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120255/awards|title=Awards IMdB|publisher=www.imdb.com |access-date=2017-05-11}}</ref>

The film ''[[Ararat (film)|Ararat]]'' (2002) generated much publicity for Egoyan. After [[Henri Verneuil]]'s French-language film ''[[Mayrig]]'' (1991), it was the first major motion picture to deal directly with the [[Armenian Genocide]]. ''[[Ararat (movie)|Ararat]]'' later won the award for [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]] at the Canadian Screen Awards, marking his third win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273435/awards|title=Awards IMdB|publisher=www.imdb.com |access-date=2017-05-11}}</ref> The film was released in over 30 countries around the world. In 2004, Egoyan opened Camera Bar, a 50-seat cinema-lounge on [[Queen Street West]] in Toronto.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/city-in-brief-2006-04-06/|title=Egoyan's Camera fades to black|date=2006-04-06|publisher=nowtoronto.com|access-date=2017-05-11}}</ref>

Beginning in September 2006, Egoyan taught at the [[University of Toronto]] for three years.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/teaching-gig-just-another-way-to-be-creative-egoyan-says-1.622105 Teaching gig just another way to be creative, Egoyan says], August 17, 2006, CBC Arts</ref> He joined the Faculty of Arts and Science as the Dean's Distinguished Visitor in theatre, film, music, and visual studies.

After the release of the [[West Memphis Three]] from 18 years in prison, Egoyan directed a movie about the case called ''[[Devil's Knot (film)|Devil's Knot]]'' (2013) starring [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Colin Firth]], based on a book, ''[[Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three]]'' by Mara Leveritt.
