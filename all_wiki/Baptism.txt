It is relationship with Christ through baptism, which enables relationship with other Christians. According to Congar, "on the basis of the baptism which incorporates us into Christ and the Word which is our Christian norm, [ecumenism's] aim is to carry out the will and the prayer of Christ, which is that his disciples should be united." The Christological foundation of Spiritual Ecumenism affirms that ecumenism is not our idea or goal, but rather Christ's will and prayer for us. Moreover, Christian unity already exists to some exent among all baptised Christians because of their relationship with Christ. Only through Christ is ecumenism possible. Kasper explains that Spiritual Ecumenism's fundamental Christological basis means that any ecumenical spirituality "will also be a sacramental spirituality."

Though some form of immersion was likely the most common method of baptism in the early church, many of the writings from the ancient church appeared to view this mode of baptism as inconsequential. The Didache 7.1–3 (AD 60–150) allowed for affusion practices in situations where immersion was not practical. Likewise, Tertullian (AD 196–212) allowed for varying approaches to baptism even if those practices did not conform to biblical or traditional mandates (cf. De corona militis 3; De baptismo 17). Finally, Cyprian (ca. AD 256) explicitly stated that the amount of water was inconsequential and defended immersion, affusion, and aspersion practices (Epistle 75.12). As a result, there was no uniform or consistent mode of baptism in the ancient church prior to the fourth century.<ref>Slade, Darren M. (August 2014).

==Mode and manner==

Baptism is practiced in several different ways. [[Aspersion]] is the sprinkling of water on the head, and [[affusion]] is the pouring of water over the head.

The word "[[immersion baptism|immersion]]" is derived from [[late Latin]] ''immersio'', a noun derived from the verb ''immergere'' (''in'' – "into" + ''mergere'' "dip"). In relation to baptism, some use it to refer to any form of dipping, whether the body is put completely under water or is only partly dipped in water; they thus speak of immersion as being either total or partial. Others, of the Anabaptist belief, use "immersion" to mean exclusively plunging someone entirely under the surface of the water.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=immersion Online Etymology Dictionary].

The word submersion comes from the [[late Latin]] (''sub-'' "under, below" + ''mergere'' "plunge, dip")<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/submerge Submerge – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (April 25, 2007). Retrieved on August 14, 2010.</ref> and is also sometimes called "complete immersion". It is the form of baptism in which the water completely covers the candidate's body. Submersion is practiced in the Orthodox and several other Eastern Churches.<ref>It is not the only method that these churches use: "In the present practice of infant baptism in the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek church]] the priest holds the child as far under the water as possible and scoops water over the head so as to be fully covered with water" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=xC9GAdUGX5sC&pg=PA894&dq=baptism+priest+%22head%22+%22so+as+to%22&hl=en&ei=g4fzTJfpM82FhQedjuylCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=baptism%20priest%20%22head%22%20%22so%20as%20to%22&f=false Everett Ferguson, ''Baptism in the Early Church'', p. 860]).</ref> In the [[Latin Church]] of the Catholic Church, baptism by submersion is used in the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and is one of the methods provided in the [[Roman Rite]] of the baptism of infants. It is seen as obligatory among some groups that have arisen since the [[Protestant Reformation]], such as [[Baptists]].

===Meaning of the Greek verb ''baptizein''===
The [[Greek-English Lexicon]] of Liddell and Scott gives the primary meaning of the verb ''baptizein'', from which the English verb "baptize" is derived, as "dip, plunge", and gives examples of plunging a sword into a throat or an embryo and for drawing wine by dipping a cup in the bowl; for New Testament usage it gives two meanings: "baptize", with which it associates the [[Septuagint]] mention of [[Naaman]] dipping himself in the [[Jordan River]], and "perform ablutions", as in Luke 11:38.<ref name="LSJ">[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=bapti/zw Liddell & Scott: entry βαπτίζω]: "βαπτ-ίζω, A. dip, plunge, 'ξίφος εἰς σφαγήν' J.BJ2.18.4; 'σπάθιον εἰς τὸ ἔμβρυον' Sor.2.63:—Pass., of a [[trepanning|trephine]], Gal.10.447; ... 2. draw wine by dipping the cup in the bowl, Aristopho 14.5; 'φιάλαις β. ἐκ . . κρατήρων' ..."

"While it is true that the basic root meaning of the Greek words for baptize and baptism is immerse/immersion, it is not true that the words can simply be reduced to this meaning, as can be seen from Mark 10:38–39, Luke 12:50, Matthew  3:11 Luke 3:16 and Corinthians10:2."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncqkZnDSeo4C&pg=PA101 |editor-first=William A. |editor-last=Dyrness |title=Global Dictionary of Theology |publisher=Intervarsity Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8308-2454-0 |page=101 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>

Two passages in the [[Gospel]]s indicate that the verb ''baptizein'' did not always indicate submersion. The first is Luke 11:38, which tells how a Pharisee, at whose house Jesus ate, "was astonished to see that he did not first wash (''ἐβαπτίσθη'', aorist passive of ''βαπτίζω''—literally, "was baptized") before dinner". This is the passage that Liddell and Scott cites as an instance of the use of ''{{lang|grc|βαπτίζω}}'' to mean ''perform ablutions''. Jesus' omission of this action is similar to that of his disciples: "Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash (''{{lang|grc|νίπτω}}'') not their hands when they eat bread".<ref>{{bibleref2|Mt|15:1–2|KJV}}</ref> The other Gospel passage pointed to is: "The Pharisees...do not eat unless they wash (''{{lang|grc|νίπτω}}'', the ordinary word for washing) their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they wash themselves (literally, "baptize themselves"—''βαπτίσωνται'', passive or middle voice of ''βαπτίζω'')".<ref>{{bibleref2|Mk|7:3–4|KJV}}</ref>

A possible additional use of the verb ''baptizein'' to relate to ritual washing is suggested by [[Peter Leithart]] (2007) who suggests that Paul's phrase "Else what shall they do who are [[baptism for the dead|baptized for the dead]]?"<ref>οἱ βαπτιζόμενοι ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν</ref> relates to Jewish ritual washing.<ref>Peter J. Leithart ''The Baptized Body'' 2007 p136 "Paul uses a distancing third person—"they" baptize for the dead. Why not "we"? Paul might well be referring to Jewish practices.

===Apparel===
Until the [[Middle Ages]], most baptisms were performed with the candidates naked—as is evidenced by most of the early portrayals of baptism (some of which are shown in this article), and the early Church Fathers and other Christian writers. Deaconesses helped female candidates for reasons of modesty.<ref>http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/aroseby.txt</ref>

Typical of these is [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] who wrote "On the Mysteries of Baptism" in the 4th century (c. 350&nbsp;AD):

{{quotation|Do you not know, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death? etc… for you are not under the Law, but under grace.

1. Therefore, I shall necessarily lay before you the sequel of yesterday's Lecture, that you may learn of what those things, which were done by you in the inner chamber, were symbolic.

2. As soon, then, as you entered, you put off your tunic; and this was an image of putting off the old man with his deeds.<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Col|3:9}}</ref> Having stripped yourselves, you were naked; in this also imitating Christ, who was stripped naked on the Cross, and by His nakedness put off from Himself the principalities and powers, and openly triumphed over them on the tree. For since the adverse powers made their lair in your members, you may no longer wear that old garment; I do not at all mean this visible one, but the old man, which waxes corrupt in the lusts of deceit.<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Eph|4:22}}</ref> May the soul which has once put him off, never again put him on, but say with the Spouse of Christ in the Song of Songs, I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on?<ref>{{Bibleref2c|SongofS|5:3|| Song of Sol 5:3}}</ref> O wondrous thing! You were naked in the sight of all, and were not ashamed; for truly ye bore the likeness of the first-formed Adam, who was naked in the garden, and was not ashamed.

3. Then, when you were stripped, you were anointed with exorcised oil, from the very hairs of your head to your feet, and were made partakers of the good olive-tree, Jesus Christ.

4. After these things, you were led to the holy pool of Divine Baptism, as Christ was carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is before our eyes. And each of you was asked, whether he believed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and you made that saving confession, and descended three times into the water, and ascended again; here also hinting by a symbol at the three days burial of Christ.... And at the self-same moment you were both dying and being born;<ref>Cyril of Jerusalem, Catechetical Lecture 20 (On the Mysteries. II. of Baptism) {{Bibleref2|Romans|6:3–14}} http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310120.htm</ref>}}

The symbolism is threefold:

1. Baptism is considered to be a form of rebirth—"by water and the Spirit"<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:5}}</ref>—the nakedness of baptism (the second birth) paralleled the condition of one's original birth. For example, St. John Chrysostom calls the baptism "λοχείαν", i.e., giving birth, and "new way of creation...from water and Spirit" ("to John" speech 25,2), and later elaborates:

: {{Quote|For nothing perceivable was handed over to us by Jesus; but with perceivable things, all of them however conceivable. This is also the way with the baptism; the gift of the water is done with a perceivable thing, but the things being conducted, i.e., the rebirth and renovation, are conceivable. For, if you were without a body, He would hand over these bodiless gifts as naked [gifts] to you. But because the soul is closely linked to the body, He hands over the perceivable ones to you with conceivable things. (Chrysostom to Matthew, speech 82, 4, c. 390&nbsp;A.D.)}}

2. The removal of clothing represented the "image of putting off the old man with his deeds" (as per Cyril, above), so the stripping of the body before for baptism represented taking off the trappings of sinful self, so that the "new man", which is given by Jesus, can be put on.
[[File:Rosa Hagström & Lars Ridderstedt II 1948.jpg|thumb|Long laced gown worn at a typical Lutheran baptism in Sweden in 1948]]
3. As St. Cyril again asserts above, as Adam and Eve in scripture were naked, innocent and unashamed in the Garden of Eden, nakedness during baptism was seen as a renewal of that innocence and state of original sinlessness. Other parallels can also be drawn, such as between the exposed condition of Christ during His crucifixion, and the crucifixion of the "old man" of the repentant sinner in preparation for baptism.

Changing customs and concerns regarding modesty probably contributed to the practice of permitting or requiring the baptismal candidate to either retain their undergarments (as in many Renaissance paintings of baptism such as those by [[da Vinci]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Van Scorel]], [[Masaccio]], [[de Wit]] and others) or to wear, as is almost universally the practice today, baptismal robes. These robes are most often white, symbolizing purity. Some groups today allow any suitable clothes to be worn, such as trousers and a [[T-shirt]]—practical considerations include how easily the clothes will dry ([[denim]] is discouraged), and whether they will become see-through when wet.

==Meaning and effects==
[[File:Baptême Cathédrale de Troyes 290308.jpg|thumb|Baptism of [[Augustine of Hippo]] as represented in a sculptural group in [[Troyes]] cathedral (1549)]]
There are differences in views about the effect of baptism for a Christian. Some Christian groups assert baptism is a requirement for salvation and a [[sacrament]], and speak of "[[baptismal regeneration]]". Its importance is related to their interpretation of the meaning of the "Mystical Body of Christ" as found in the New Testament. This view is shared by the [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] denominations, and by Churches formed early during the [[Protestant Reformation]] such as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]. For example, [[Martin Luther]] said:

{{Quote|To put it most simply, the power, effect, benefit, fruit, and purpose of Baptism is to save. No one is baptized in order to become a prince, but as the words say, to "be saved". To be saved, we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil and to enter into the kingdom of Christ and live with him forever.|''[[Luther's Large Catechism]]'', 1529}}

The [[Churches of Christ]],"<ref name= "Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" />{{rp|66}}<ref name= "Theology Matters" />{{rp|112}} [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christadelphians]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also espouse baptism as necessary for salvation.

For Roman Catholics, baptism by water is a sacrament of initiation into the life of the children of God (''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', 1212–13). It configures the person to Christ (CCC 1272), and obliges the Christian to share in the Church's apostolic and missionary activity (CCC 1270). The Catholic holds that there are three types of baptism by which one can be saved: sacramental baptism (with water), baptism of desire (explicit or implicit desire to be part of the Church founded by Jesus Christ), and baptism of blood ([[martyrdom]]). In his encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'' of June 29, 1943, [[Pope Pius XII]] spoke of baptism and profession of the true faith as what makes members of the one true Church, which is the body of Jesus Christ himself, as God the Holy Spirit has taught through the Apostle Paul:
{{Quote|
:'''18'''...Through the waters of Baptism those who are born into this world dead in sin are not only born again and made members of the Church, but being stamped with a spiritual seal they become able and fit to receive the other Sacraments. ...
:'''22''' Actually only those are to be included as members of the Church who have been baptized and profess the true faith, and who have not been so unfortunate as to separate themselves from the unity of the Body, or been excluded by legitimate authority for grave faults committed. 'For in one spirit' says the Apostle, 'were we all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free.' As therefore in the true Christian community there is only one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one Baptism, so there can be only one faith. And therefore if a man refuse to hear the Church let him be considered—so the Lord commands—as a heathen and a publican. It follows that those who are divided in faith or government cannot be living in the unity of such a Body, nor can they be living the life of its one Divine Spirit. |[http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P12MYSTI.HTM ''Mystici corporis Christi'' (full text in an English translation)]}}

By contrast, [[Anabaptist]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Protestants recognize baptism as an outward sign of an inward reality following on an individual believer's experience of forgiving grace. [[Reformed]] and [[Methodist]] Protestants maintain a link between baptism and regeneration, but insist that it is not automatic or mechanical, and that regeneration may occur at a different time than baptism.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Faith of the Christian Church|last=Inbody|first=Tyron|year=2005|url=https://www.questia.com/read/119924426/the-faith-of-the-christian-church-an-introduction|publisher=William B. Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|page=299}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> [[Churches of Christ]] consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do."<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" />{{rp|p.66}} Thus, they see baptism as a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God".<ref name="Theology Matters">Harold Hazelip, Gary Holloway, Randall J.

===Christian traditions===
[[File:BaptismalFontStRaphaelDubuque.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The baptistry at [[St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque)|St. Raphael's Cathedral]], [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], Iowa. This particular font was expanded in 2005 to include a small pool to provide for immersion baptism of adults. Eight-sided font architectures are common symbology of the day of Christ's Resurrection: the "Eighth Day".]]

The [[liturgy]] of baptism for [[Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] makes clear reference to baptism as not only a symbolic burial and resurrection, but an actual supernatural transformation, one that draws parallels to the experience of [[Noah]] and the passage of the [[Israelites]] through the [[Red Sea]] divided by [[Moses]]. Thus, baptism is literally and symbolically not only cleansing, but also dying and rising again with Christ. Catholics believe baptism is necessary to cleanse the taint of [[original sin]], and so commonly baptise infants.

The Eastern Churches ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]) also baptize infants on the basis of texts, such as Matthew 19:14, which are interpreted as supporting full Church membership for children. In these denominations, baptism is immediately followed by [[Chrismation]] and [[Eucharist|Communion]] at the next [[Divine Liturgy]], regardless of age. Orthodox likewise believe that baptism removes what they call the ancestral sin of Adam.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicodemos the Hagiorite |title=Concerning Thoughts |work=Exomologetarion |url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/exo_thoughts.aspx|author-link=Nicodemos the Hagiorite }}</ref> Anglicans believe that Baptism is also the entry into the Church and therefore allows them access to all rights and responsibilities as full members, including the privilege to receive Holy Communion. Most Methodists and Anglicans agree that it also cleanses the taint of what in the West is called original sin, in the East ancestral sin.
[[File:Baptism Jar (Portuguese period).JPG|thumb|Baptism Jar, used in [[Portuguese Ceylon]].]]
Eastern Orthodox Christians usually insist on complete threefold immersion as both a symbol of death and rebirth into Christ, and as a washing away of sin. [[Latin Church]] Catholics generally baptize by affusion (pouring); Eastern Catholics usually by submersion, or at least partial immersion. However, submersion is gaining in popularity within the Latin Catholic Church. In newer church sanctuaries, the baptismal font may be designed to expressly allow for baptism by immersion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Anglicans baptize by immersion or affusion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Holy Baptism |url=https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/christian-initiation/holy-baptism-accessible-language/holy-baptism |publisher=The Church of England}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Baptism |url=https://episcopalchurch.org/baptism |publisher=Episcopal Church}}</ref>

According to evidence which can be traced back to about the year 200,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Tertullian |editor=[[Philip Schaff]] |title=Ante-Nicene Fathers |chapter=Of the Persons to Whom, and the Time When, Baptism is to Be Administered |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.vi.iii.xviii.html|author-link=Tertullian |title-link=Ante-Nicene Fathers (book) }}</ref> sponsors or godparents are present at baptism and vow to uphold the Christian education and life of the baptized.

Baptists argue that the Greek word {{lang|grc|βαπτίζω}} originally meant "to immerse". They interpret some Biblical passages concerning baptism as requiring submersion of the body in water. They also state that only submersion reflects the symbolic significance of being "buried" and "raised" with Christ.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Rom|6:3–4}}</ref> Baptist Churches baptize in the name of the [[Trinity]]—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. However, they do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation; but rather that it is an act of Christian obedience.

Some "[[Full Gospel]]" [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] churches such as [[Oneness Pentecostal]]s baptize only in the name of Jesus Christ, citing Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus as their authority.<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Ac|2:38}}</ref>

===Ecumenical statements===
In 1982 the [[World Council of Churches]] published the [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical]] paper ''[[Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry]]''. The preface of the document states:

{{quotation|Those who know how widely the churches have differed in doctrine and practice on baptism, Eucharist and ministry, will appreciate the importance of the large measure of agreement registered here. Virtually all the confessional traditions are included in the Commission's membership. That theologians of such widely different denominations should be able to speak so harmoniously about baptism, Eucharist and ministry is unprecedented in the modern ecumenical movement. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the Commission also includes among its full members theologians of the Catholic and other churches which do not belong to the World Council of Churches itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry.html#c10471 |title=Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry—Faith and Order Paper No. 111 |publisher=[[World Council of Churches]] |year=1982 |accessdate=March 1, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709031256/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry.html |archivedate=July 9, 2008 }}</ref>}}

A 1997 document, ''Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism'', gave the views of a commission of experts brought together under the aegis of the World Council of Churches. It states:

{{Quote|...according to Acts 2:38, baptisms follow from Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus and lead those baptized to the receiving of Christ's Spirit, the Holy Ghost, and life in the community: "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers"<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|2:42|RSV}}</ref> as well as to the distribution of goods to those in need.<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|Acts|2:45}}</ref>}}

Those who heard, who were baptized and entered the community's life, were already made witnesses of and partakers in the promises of God for the last days: the forgiveness of sins through baptism in the name of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on all flesh.<ref name="bibleref2c|Ac|2:38">{{bibleref2c|Ac|2:38}}</ref> Similarly, in what may well be a baptismal pattern, [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] testifies that proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and teaching about new life<ref>{{bibleref2c|1Pe|1:3–21||1 Pe 1:3–21}}</ref> lead to purification and new birth.<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|1Pe.|1:22–23||1 Pet. 1:22–23}}</ref> This, in turn, is followed by eating and drinking [[Holy Communion|God's food]],<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:2–3||1 Pet. 2:2–3}}</ref> by participation in the life of the community—the royal priesthood, the new temple, the people of God<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:4–10||1 Pet. 2:4–10}}</ref>—and by further moral formation.<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:11ff||1 Pet. 2:11 ff.}}</ref> At the beginning of 1 Peter the writer sets this baptism in the context of obedience to Christ and sanctification by the Spirit.<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|1:2||1 Pet. 1:2}}</ref> So baptism into Christ is seen as baptism into the Spirit.<ref>{{bibleref2c|1Cor|12:13||1 Co 12:13}}</ref> In the fourth gospel Jesus' discourse with [[Nicodemus]] indicates that birth by water and Spirit becomes the gracious means of entry into the place where God rules.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Jn|3:5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oikoumene.org/index.php?id=2672 |title=Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism |publisher=[[World Council of Churches]] |year=1997 |accessdate=May 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509161956/http://www.oikoumene.org/index.php?id=2672 |archivedate=May 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Validity considerations by some churches===
[[File:Окрещённый ребёнок.jpg|thumb|[[Russian Orthodox]] priest greeting an infant and its godparents on the steps of the church at the beginning of the [[Sacred Mystery]] of Baptism.]]

The vast majority of Christian denominations admit the theological idea that baptism is a [[sacrament]], that has actual spiritual, holy and salvific effects. Certain key criteria must be complied with for it to be valid, i.e., to actually have those effects. If these key criteria are met, violation of some rules regarding baptism, such as varying the authorized rite for the ceremony, renders the baptism illicit (contrary to the church's laws) but still valid.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Ecumenical Proposal About The Sacraments|last=Bruno|first=Luciano|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=16–17}}</ref>

One of the criteria for validity is use of the correct form of words. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the use of the verb "baptize" is essential.<ref name="cathen" /> Catholics of the [[Latin Church]], Anglicans and Methodists use the form "I baptize you...." Eastern Orthodox and some [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] use a [[passive voice]] form "The Servant/(Handmaiden) of God is baptized in the name of...." or "This person is baptized by my hands...."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Use of the [[Trinitarian formula]] "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" is also considered essential; thus these churches do not accept as valid baptisms of non-[[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] churches such as [[Oneness Pentecostals]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Another essential condition is use of water. A baptism in which some liquid that would not usually be called water, such as wine, milk, soup or fruit juice was used would not be considered valid.<ref name=Fanning/>

Another requirement is that the celebrant intends to perform baptism. This requirement entails merely the intention "to do what the Church does",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1256 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> not necessarily to have Christian faith, since it is not the person baptizing, but the Holy Spirit working through the sacrament, who produces the effects of the sacrament. Doubt about the faith of the baptizer is thus no ground for doubt about the validity of the baptism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/DOCTRINE/INTENTIO.TXT |title=On the Intention Required in the Minister of the Sacraments |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>

Some conditions expressly do not affect validity—for example, whether submersion, immersion, affusion or aspersion is used. However, if water is sprinkled, there is a danger that the water may not touch the skin of the unbaptized. As has been stated, "it is not sufficient for the water to merely touch the candidate; it must also flow, otherwise there would seem to be no real ablution. At best, such a baptism would be considered doubtful. If the water touches only the hair, the sacrament has probably been validly conferred, though in practice the safer course must be followed. If only the clothes of the person have received the aspersion, the baptism is undoubtedly void."<ref name=Fanning>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm |title=William Fanning, "Baptism" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1907) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> For many communions, validity is not affected if a single submersion or pouring is performed rather than a triple, but in Orthodoxy this is controversial.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

According to the Catholic Church, baptism imparts an [[sacramental character|indelible "seal"]] upon the soul of the baptized and therefore a person who has already been baptized cannot be validly baptized again. This teaching was affirmed against the [[Donatist]]s who practiced rebaptism. The grace received in baptism is believed to operate ''ex opere operato'' and is therefore considered valid even if administered in heretical or schismatic groups.<ref name="ODWR">{{Cite book|first=John |last=Bowker |authorlink=John Bowker (theologian) |title=The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-866242-4 |oclc=60181672|title-link=Oxford Dictionary of World Religions }}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>

===Recognition by other denominations===
The [[Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Anglican]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Methodist]] Churches accept baptism performed by other denominations within this group as valid, subject to certain conditions, including the use of the Trinitarian formula. It is only possible to be baptized once, thus people with valid baptisms from other denominations may not be baptized again upon conversion or transfer. For Roman Catholics, this is affirmed in the [https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2X.HTM Canon Law 864], in which it is written that "[e]very person not yet baptized and only such a person is capable of baptism."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2X.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law – IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-04-19}}</ref> Such people are accepted upon making a profession of faith and, if they have not yet validly received the sacrament/rite of confirmation or chrismation, by being confirmed. Specifically, "Methodist theologians argued that since God never abrogated a covenant made and sealed with proper intentionality, rebaptism was never an option, unless the original baptism had been defective by not having been made in the name of the Trinity."<ref name="CracknellWhite2005">{{cite book|last1=Cracknell|first1=Kenneth|last2=White|first2=Susan J.|title=An Introduction to World Methodism|date=5 May 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English|isbn=9780521818490|page=193}}</ref> In some cases it can be difficult to decide if the original baptism was in fact valid; if there is doubt, [[conditional baptism]] is administered, with a formula on the lines of "If you are not yet baptized, I baptize you...."<ref name="Jr2014">{{cite book|last=Jr|first=Charles Yrigoyen|title=T&T Clark Companion to Methodism|date=25 September 2014|publisher=A&C Black|language=English|isbn=9780567290779|page=263|quote=Methdoists historically do not rebaptize unless the ecumenical formula was not used or another major impediment calls into question the adequacy of an earlier rite.

In the still recent past, it was common practice in the Roman Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from Protestantism because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete case. In the case of the major Protestant Churches, agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestants. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the Churches of [[Eastern Christianity]], but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html |title=Response of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher=Vatican.va |date=June 5, 2001 |accessdate=February 25, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090223230027/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html| archivedate= February 23, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Practice in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] for converts from other communions is not uniform. However, generally baptisms performed in the name of the Holy Trinity are accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church. If a convert has not received the sacrament (mysterion) of baptism, he or she must be baptised in the name of the Holy Trinity before they may enter into communion with the Orthodox Church. If he has been baptized in another Christian confession (other than Orthodox Christianity) his previous baptism is considered retroactively filled with grace by [[chrismation]] or, in rare circumstances, [[confession of faith]] alone as long as the baptism was done in the name of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The exact procedure is dependent on local [[canon law|canons]] and is the subject of some controversy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

There is debate among Christian churches as to who can administer baptism. Some claim that the examples given in the New Testament only show apostles and deacons administering baptism.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Ancient Christian churches interpret this as indicating that baptism should be performed by the clergy except ''in extremis'', i.e., [[emergency baptism|when the one being baptized is in immediate danger of death]]. Then anyone may baptize, provided, in the view of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the person who does the baptizing is a member of that Church, or, in the view of the Catholic Church, that the person, even if not baptized, intends to do what the Church does in administering the rite. Many Protestant churches see no specific prohibition in the biblical examples and permit any believer to baptize another.

In the Roman Catholic Church, [[canon law]] for the [[Latin Church]] lays down that the ordinary minister of baptism is a bishop, priest or deacon,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM |title=canon 861 §1 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> but its administration is one of the functions "especially entrusted to the [[priest|parish priest]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1T.HTM#18G |title=canon 530 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> If the person to be baptized is at least fourteen years old, that person's baptism is to be referred to the bishop, so that he can decide whether to confer the baptism himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM |title=canon 863 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> If no ordinary minister is available, a [[catechist]] or some other person whom the local [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] has appointed for this purpose may licitly do the baptism; indeed in a case of necessity ''any'' person (irrespective of that person's religion) who has the requisite intention may confer the baptism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM |title=canon 861 §2 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>  By "a case of necessity" is meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. "The requisite intention" is, at the minimum level, the intention "to do what the Church does" through the rite of baptism.

In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister. Administration of the sacrament is reserved to the Parish Priest or to another priest to whom he or the local [[ordinary (officer)|hierarch]] grants permission, a permission that can be presumed if in accordance with canon law. However, "in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/__PIT.HTM |title=Canon 677 |work=[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] |year=1990 |accessdate=February 26, 2009}}</ref>

The discipline of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] is similar to that of the Eastern Catholic Churches. They require the baptizer, even in cases of necessity, to be of their own faith, on the grounds that a person cannot convey what he himself does not possess, in this case membership in the Church.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ware |first=Kallistos |authorlink=Timothy Ware |year=1964 |title=The Orthodox Church |page=285 |location=New York City |publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}</ref> The Latin Catholic Church does not insist on this condition, considering that the effect of the sacrament, such as membership of the Church, is not produced by the person who baptizes, but by the Holy Spirit. For the Orthodox, while Baptism ''in extremis'' may be administered by a deacon or any lay-person, if the newly baptized person survives, a priest must still perform the other prayers of the Rite of Baptism, and administer the [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] of [[Chrismation]].

The discipline of [[Anglicanism]] and [[Lutheranism]] is similar to that of the Latin Catholic Church. For [[Methodists]] and many other Protestant denominations, too, the ordinary minister of baptism is a duly ordained or appointed minister of religion.

Newer movements of Protestant [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches, particularly non-denominational, allow laypeople to baptize.

In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, only a man who has been ordained to the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] holding the priesthood office of [[Priest (Mormonism)|priest]] or higher office in the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] may administer baptism.<ref name= "churchofjesuschrist.org">{{cite book |chapter= Priesthood § Aaronic Priesthood |chapter-url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/priesthood-and-auxiliary-leaders-guidebook/priesthood?lang=eng |title= Priesthood and Auxiliary Leaders' Guidebook |publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |year= 2001 |pages= 4–10 |quote= Brethren who hold the Aaronic Priesthood have authority to perform certain priesthood ordinances.

A [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] baptism is performed by a "dedicated male" adherent.<ref name= "autogenerated480">"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, page 480, "In connection with baptism, it may also be noted that a baptism may be performed by a dedicated male even though no other human witnesses are present."</ref><ref>"The General Priesthood Today", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1963, page 147, "Because he is a minister, any competent male member is called on to perform funerals, baptisms and weddings, and to conduct the service in annual commemoration of the Lord's death."</ref> Only in extraordinary circumstances would a "dedicated" baptizer be unbaptized (see section ''[[#Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witnesses]]'').

==Specific Christian groups practicing baptism==

[[File:River baptism in New Bern.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A river baptism in [[North Carolina]] at the turn of the 20th century. Full-immersion (submersion) baptism continues to be a common practice in many African-American Christian congregations today.]]

[[Anabaptist]]s and [[Baptists]] recognize only [[believer's baptism]] or "adult baptism". Baptism is seen as an act identifying one as having accepted Jesus Christ as savior.

===Anabaptist===
Early Anabaptists were given that name because they re-baptized persons who they felt had not been properly baptized, having received infant baptism, sprinkling.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anabaptist | title = Online Etymological Dictionary | origyear = 2001 | year = 2010 | first = Douglas | last = Harper | contribution = Anabaptist | access-date = August 6, 2013}}</ref>

The traditional form of Anabaptist baptism was pouring or sprinkling, the form commonly used in the West in the early 16th century when they emerged. Since the 18th century immersion and submersion became more widespread. Today all forms of baptism can be found among Anabaptist.<ref>[http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Baptism#Mode_and_Ritual Baptism – Mode and Ritual] at [[Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online]].</ref>

===Baptist===
For the majority of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Mt|28:19}}</ref> It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus.

For a new convert the general practice is that baptism also allows the person to be a registered member of the local Baptist congregation (though some churches have adopted "new members classes" as a mandatory step for congregational membership).

Regarding rebaptism the general rules are:
*baptisms by other than immersion are not recognized as valid and therefore rebaptism by immersion is required; and 
*baptisms by immersion in other denominations may be considered valid if performed after the person having professed faith in Jesus Christ (though among the more conservative groups such as [[Independent Baptists]], rebaptism may be required by the local congregation if performed in a non-Baptist church – and, in extreme cases, even if performed within a Baptist church that wasn't an Independent Baptist congregation)

Churches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom.

===Catholicism===
{{see also|Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Baptismal vows|Parish register}}
In Catholic teaching, baptism is stated to be "necessary for salvation by actual reception or at least by desire".<ref name="can849">{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2T.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 849 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=February 25, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090115174636/http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2T.HTM| archivedate= January 15, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Catholic doctrine holds that the baptism ceremony is ordinarily performed by deacons, [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priests]], or bishops, but in an emergency can be performed by any Catholic. This teaching is based on the [[Gospel according to John]] which says that Jesus proclaimed: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God."<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:5|RSV}}</ref> It dates back to the teachings and practices of 1st-century Christians, and the connection between salvation and baptism was not, on the whole, an item of major dispute until [[Huldrych Zwingli]] denied the necessity of baptism, which he saw as merely a sign granting admission to the Christian community.<ref name="cross2005baptism"/> The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that "Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament."<ref name="vatican" />  The [[Council of Trent]] also states in the ''Decree Concerning Justification'' from session six that baptism is necessary for salvation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Council of Trent Session 6|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/trent6.htm}}</ref>  A person who knowingly, willfully and unrepentantly rejects baptism has no hope of salvation. However, if knowledge is absent, "those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church, yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience."<ref>{{cite web|title=LUMEN GENTIUM |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |work=Vatican II |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906031754/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |archivedate=September 6, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>

The Catechism of the Catholic Church also states: "Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more [[exorcism]]s are pronounced over the candidate".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3J.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1237 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> In the [[Roman Rite]] of the baptism of a child, the wording of the prayer of exorcism is: "Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the splendour of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her) free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). Through Christ our Lord."<ref>Rite of Baptism of Children, 86</ref>

In the Catholic Church by baptism all sins are forgiven, original sin and all personal sins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocp.org/what-is-baptism |title=What is Baptism? |publisher=Oregon Catholic Press |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}</ref> Given once for all, baptism cannot be repeated. Baptism not only purifies from all sins, but also makes the neophyte "a new creature," an adopted son of God, who has become a "partaker of the divine nature," member of Christ and co-heir with him, and a temple of the Holy Spirit. Sanctifying grace, the grace of justification, given by God by baptism, erases the original sin and personal actual sins.<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church: THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM</ref>

Catholics are baptized in water, by submersion, immersion or affusion, or aspersion (sprinkling), in the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit<ref>''Ordo initiationis christanae adultorum'', editio typica, Vatican City, Typis polyglottis vaticanis, 1972, pg 92, cf Lateran IV ''De Fide Catholica'', DS 802, cf Florence, ''Decretum pro Armeniis'', DS, 1317.</ref>—not three gods, but [[Trinity|one God subsisting in three Persons]]. While sharing in the one divine essence, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct, not simply three "masks" or manifestations of one divine being. The faith of the Church and of the individual Christian is based on a relationship with these three "Persons" of the one God. Adults can also be baptized through the [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults]].

It is claimed that [[Pope Stephen I]], [[St. Ambrose]] and [[Pope Nicholas I]] declared that baptisms in the name of "Jesus" only as well as in the name of "Father, Son and Holy Spirit" were valid. The correct interpretation of their words is disputed.<ref name="cathen" /> Current [[canonical law]] requires the Trinitarian formula and water for validity.<ref name="can849" />

The Church recognizes two equivalents of baptism with water: "baptism of blood" and "[[baptism of desire]]". Baptism of blood is that undergone by unbaptized individuals who are [[martyr]]ed for their faith, while baptism of desire generally applies to [[catechumen]]s who die before they can be baptized. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes these two forms:

<blockquote>The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This ''Baptism of blood'', like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament. (1258)</blockquote>

<blockquote>For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament. (1259)</blockquote>

The Catholic Church holds that those who are ignorant of Christ's Gospel and of the Church, but who seek the truth and do God's will as they understand it, may be supposed to have an implicit desire for baptism and can be saved: "'Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.' Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P3M.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1260 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> As for unbaptized infants, the Church is unsure of their fate; "the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P3M.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1261 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>

===Lutheranism===
{{Further|Lutheran sacraments}}
In [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Christianity]], baptism is a sacrament that [[baptismal regeneration|regenerates the soul]].<ref name="Schmid1876">{{cite book |last1=Schmid |first1=Heinrich |title=The Doctrinal Theology of the Evangelical Lutheran Church |date=1876 |publisher=Lutheran Publication Society |page=595 |language=English|quote=By Baptism we are regenerated and renewed; by the Lord's Supper we are fed and nourished unto eternal life. In ''Baptism'', especially that of infants, faith is kindled by the Holy Spirit; in the use of the ''Supper'' it is increased, confirmed, and sealed. By ''Baptism'' we are grafted into Christ; by the ''salutary use of the Lord's Supper'' we receive a spiritual increase in this relation. By ''Baptism'' we are received into the divine covenant; by the ''use of the Eucharist'' we are preserved in it, or, when we fall from it by sins against conscience, we are restored to it by true penitence.}}</ref> Upon one's baptism, one receives the [[Holy Spirit]] and becomes a part of the Church.<ref name="Schmid1876"/>

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
[[File:GreekOrthodoxBaptism1.jpg|thumb|An Orthodox baptism]]

In Eastern Orthodoxy, baptism is considered a sacrament and mystery which transforms the old and sinful person into a new and pure one, where the old life, the sins, any mistakes made are gone and a clean slate is given. In [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek]] and [[Russian Orthodox]] traditions, it is taught that through Baptism a person is united to the [[Body of Christ]] by becoming an official member of the Orthodox Church. During the service, the Orthodox priest blesses the [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|water]] to be used . The catechumen (the one baptised) is fully immersed in the water three times in the name of the Trinity. This is considered to be a death of the "old man" by participation in the crucifixion and burial of Christ, and a rebirth into new life in Christ by participation in his resurrection.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=277–278}} Properly a new name is given, which becomes the person's name.

Babies of Orthodox families are normally baptized shortly after birth. Older converts to Orthodoxy are usually formally baptized into the Orthodox Church, though exceptions are sometimes made. Those who have left Orthodoxy and adopted a new religion, if they return to their Orthodox roots, are usually received back into the church through [[Chrismation]].

Properly and generally, the Mystery of Baptism is administered by bishops and other priests; however, in emergencies any Orthodox Christian can baptize.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=278}} In such cases, should the person survive the emergency, it is likely that the person will be properly baptized by a priest at some later date. This is not considered to be a second baptism, nor is it imagined that the person is not already Orthodox, but rather it is a fulfillment of the proper form.

The service of Baptism in [[Greek Orthodox]] (and other Eastern Orthodox) churches has remained largely unchanged for over 1500 years. This fact is witnessed to by St. [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (d. 386), who, in his ''Discourse on the Sacrament of Baptism'', describes the service in much the same way as is currently in use.

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
The [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses]] believes that baptism should be performed by complete immersion (submersion) in water and only when an individual is old enough to understand its significance. They believe that water baptism is an outward symbol that a person has made an unconditional dedication through Jesus Christ to do the will of God. Only after baptism, is a person considered a full-fledged Witness, and an official member of the Christian Congregation.  They consider baptism to constitute ordination as a [[Christian minister|minister]].<ref>''Jet'' magazine, August 4, 1955, page 26 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xbEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=%22jehovah%27s+witnesses%22 Online]</ref>

Prospective candidates for baptism must express their desire to be baptized well in advance of a planned baptismal event, to allow for congregation [[Elder (Christianity)#Jehovah's Witnesses|elders]] to assess their suitability (regarding true repentance and conversion).<ref>''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 182.</ref> Elders approve candidates for baptism if the candidates are considered to understand what is expected of members of the religion and to demonstrate sincere dedication to the faith.<ref>''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 217–218.</ref>

Most baptisms among Jehovah's Witnesses are performed at scheduled assemblies and conventions by elders and ministerial servants, in special pools, or sometimes oceans, rivers, or lakes, depending on circumstances,<ref>''The Watchtower'', May 15, 1970, page 309.</ref><ref>"The General Priesthood Today", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1963, page 147</ref><ref>''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 215, "Baptisms are usually performed at assemblies and conventions of Jehovah's Witnesses."</ref> and rarely occur at local [[Kingdom Hall]]s.<ref name=autogenerated1>"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, page 480</ref> Prior to baptism, at the conclusion of a pre-baptism talk, candidates must affirm two questions:<ref>Watchtower June 1, 1985</ref>
{{quote|
# On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will?
# Do you understand that your dedication and baptism identify you as one of Jehovah's Witnesses in association with God's spirit-directed organization?}}

Only baptized males (elders or ministerial servants) may baptize new members. Baptizers and candidates wear swimsuits or other informal clothing for baptism, but are directed to avoid clothing that is considered undignified or too revealing.<ref name="autogenerated1999">""God's Prophetic Word" District Conventions", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', May 1999, page 4</ref><ref>"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 1973, page 254–255</ref><ref>"Question Box", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', June 1993, page 3</ref> Generally, candidates are individually immersed by a single baptizer,<ref name="autogenerated1999"/> unless a candidate has special circumstances such as a physical [[disability]].<ref name="The Watchtower 1986, page 31">"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', November 15, 1986, page 31</ref> In circumstances of extended isolation, a qualified candidate's dedication and stated intention to become baptized may serve to identify him as a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, even if immersion itself must be delayed.<ref>"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, pages 479–480</ref> In rare instances, unbaptized males who had stated such an intention have reciprocally baptized each other, with both baptisms accepted as valid.<ref>"Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands", ''1987 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', page 71</ref> Individuals who had been baptized in the 1930s and 1940s by female Witnesses due to extenuating circumstances, such as in concentration camps, were later re-baptized but still recognized their original baptism dates.<ref name="autogenerated480" />

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
[[File:Mormon baptism circa 1850s.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|A Mormon baptism, circa the 1850s]]
{{Main|Baptism in Mormonism}}

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), baptism is recognized as the first of several [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] (rituals) of the [[gospel]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Bruce D. |last=Porter |authorlink=Bruce D. Porter |date=October 2000 |title=The First Principles and Ordinances of the Gospel |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2000/10/the-first-principles-and-ordinances-of-the-gospel |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]}}</ref> In [[Mormonism]], baptism has the main purpose of remitting the [[sin]]s of the participant. It is followed by [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]], which inducts the person into membership in the church and constitutes a [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]]. Latter-day Saints believe that baptism must be by full immersion, and by a precise ritualized ordinance: if some part of the participant is not fully immersed, or the ordinance was not recited verbatim, the ritual must be repeated.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/priesthood-and-church-government/lesson-5-performing-priesthood-ordinances?lang=eng |title= Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part B |chapter= Performing Priesthood Ordinances § Baptism |year= 2000 |pages= 41–48 |publisher= LDS Church }}</ref> It typically occurs in a [[baptismal font]].

In addition, members of the LDS Church do not believe a baptism is valid unless it is performed by a Latter-day Saint one who has proper authority (a [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priest]] or [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]]).<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/gs/baptism-baptize?lang=eng |title= Guide to the Scriptures: Baptism, Baptize § Proper authority |website= churchofjesuschrist.org |publisher= LDS Church }}</ref> Authority is passed down through a form of [[apostolic succession]]. All new converts to the faith must be baptized or [[rebaptism (Mormonism)|re-baptized]]. Baptism is seen as symbolic both of Jesus' death, burial and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/baptism?lang=eng |title= Baptism |work= [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]]: [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|Bible Dictionary]] |publisher= LDS Church |year= 1979 }}</ref> and is also symbolic of the baptized individual discarding their "natural" self and donning a new identity as a disciple of Jesus.

According to Latter-day Saint theology, [[faith]] and [[repentance]] are prerequisites to baptism. The ritual does not cleanse the participant of [[original sin]], as Latter-day Saints do not believe the doctrine of original sin. Mormonism rejects [[infant baptism]]<ref>[[Book of Mormon]], {{lds|Moroni|moro|8|4|23}}</ref><ref name="EoM Infant Baptism">{{citation |last= Parsons |first= Robert E. |contribution= Infant Baptism: LDS Perspective |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3795 |page= 682 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H.

Latter-day Saint theology also teaches [[baptism for the dead]] in which deceased ancestors are baptized vicariously by the living, and believe that their practice is what Paul wrote of in Corinthians 15:29. This occurs in [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|Latter-day Saint temples]].<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/baptisms-for-the-dead?lang=eng |title= Gospel Topics: Baptisms for the Dead |website= churchofjesuschrist.org |publisher= LDS Church }}</ref><ref name="EoM Baptism for the dead">{{citation |last= Burton |first= H.

==Non-practitioners==

===Quakers===
[[Quakers]] (members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]]) do not believe in the baptism of either children or adults with water, rejecting all forms of outward [[sacraments]] in their religious life. [[Robert Barclay]]'s ''Apology for the True Christian Divinity'' (a historic explanation of Quaker theology from the 17th century), explains Quakers' opposition to baptism with water thus:

{{Quote|I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Mt|3:11}}</ref> Here John mentions two manners of baptizings and two different baptisms, the one with water, and the other with the Spirit, the one whereof he was the minister of, the other whereof Christ was the minister of: and such as were baptized with the first were not therefore baptized with the second: "I indeed baptize you, but he shall baptize you." Though in the present time they were baptized with the baptism of water, yet they were not as yet, but were to be, baptized with the baptism of Christ.|[[Robert Barclay]], 1678<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/prop12.html |title=Apology, Proposition 12 |publisher=Qhpress.org |accessdate=July 28, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090617033930/http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/prop12.html| archivedate= June 17, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>}}

[[Robert Barclay|Barclay]] argued that water baptism was only something that happened until the time of Christ, but that now, people are baptised inwardly by the spirit of Christ, and hence there is no need for the external sacrament of water baptism, which [[Quakers]] argue is meaningless.

===Salvation Army===
The [[Salvation Army]] does not practice water baptism, or indeed other outward [[sacraments]]. [[William Booth]] and [[Catherine Booth]], the founders of the [[Salvation Army]], believed that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself. They believed what was important was spiritual grace itself. However, although the [[Salvation Army]] does not practice baptism, they are not opposed to baptism within other Christian denominations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/vw-print/C28E39B2CA06E8F98025708A003D9FAC?openDocument |title=Why does The Salvation Army not baptise or hold communion? |publisher=The Salvation Army |date=February 28, 1987 |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233651/http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/vw-print/C28E39B2CA06E8F98025708A003D9FAC?openDocument |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}</ref>

===Hyperdispensationalism===
<!-- This section is linked from Baptism-->
There are some Christians termed "[[Hyperdispensationalism|Hyperdispensationalists]]" (Mid-Acts dispensationalism) who accept only Paul's Epistles as directly applicable for the church today. They do not accept water baptism as a practice for the church since Paul who was God's apostle to the nations was not sent to baptize. Ultradispensationalists (Acts 28 dispensationalism) who do not accept the practice of the Lord's supper, do not practice baptism because these are not found in the Prison Epistles.<ref>"Prison epistles" include [[Ephesians]], [[Colossians]], [[Philippians]], and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]]</ref> Both sects believe water baptism was a valid practice for covenant Israel. Hyperdispensationalists also teach that Peter's gospel message was not the same as Paul's.<ref>{{cite web |first=David M. |last=Havard |title=Are We Hyper-Dispensationalists? |url=http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/articles/1011392439.html |publisher=Berean Bible Society |accessdate=January 19, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204081633/http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/articles/1011392439.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hyperdispensationalists assert:

*The great commission<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|28:18–20}}</ref> and its baptism is directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later.
*The baptism of Acts 2:36–38 is Peter's call for Israel to repent of complicity in the death of their Messiah; not as a Gospel announcement of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sin, a later doctrine revealed by Paul.

Water baptism found early in the Book of Acts is, according to this view, now supplanted by the one baptism<ref>{{Bibleref2c|1cor|12:13||1 Cor 12:13}}</ref> foretold by John the Baptist.<ref>{{bibleref2|Luke|3:16}}, {{bibleref2|John|1:33}}, {{bibleref2|Matt|3:11}}{{bibleref2|Acts|1:5}}</ref> Others make a distinction between John's prophesied baptism by Christ with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit's baptism of the believer into the body of Christ; the latter being the one baptism for today. The one baptism for today, it is asserted, is the "baptism of the [[Holy Spirit]]" of the believer into the Body of Christ church.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Ac|11:15–16}}</ref>

Many in this group also argue that John's promised [[Baptized by fire|baptism by fire]] is pending, referring to the destruction of the world by fire.<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|3:12}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|3:17}}, {{bibleref2|2|Pe|3:10||2 Peter 3:10}}</ref>

John, as he said "baptized with water", as did Jesus's disciples to the early, Jewish Christian church. Jesus himself never personally baptized with water, but did so through his disciples.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Jn|4:1–2}}</ref> Unlike Jesus' first apostles, Paul, his apostle to the Gentiles, was sent to preach rather than to baptize<ref>{{bibleref2c|1Cor.|1:17||1 Co 1:17}}</ref> in contradiction to the Great Commission.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Mt|28:19}}</ref> But Paul did occasionally still baptize Jews, for instance in Corinth<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|1:14–16}}</ref> and in Philippi.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Ac|16:13}}</ref> He also taught the spiritual significance of Spirit baptism in identifying the believer with the atoning death of Christ, his burial, and resurrection.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Rom|6:4}}</ref> Romans 6 baptism does not mention nor imply water but is rather a real baptism into Christ's death.

Other Hyperdispensationalists believe that baptism was necessary until mid-Acts. The great commission<ref>{{bibleref2c|Mt|28:18–20}}</ref> and its baptism was directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later. Any Jew who believed did not receive salvation<ref>{{bibleref2c|Mk|16:16}}</ref><ref>{{bibleref2c|1Peter|3:21||1 Pe 3:21}}</ref> or the baptism of the Holy Spirit<ref name="bibleref2c|Ac|2:38"/> until they were water baptized. This period ended with the calling of Paul.<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|9:17–18}}</ref> Peter's reaction when the Gentiles received the Holy Spirit before baptism<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|10:44–48}}</ref> is seen as proof of transition from water to Spirit baptism. Also significant is the lack of any instructions in the Acts 15 apostolic conference requiring Gentiles to be water baptized.

===Debaptism===
{{main|Debaptism}}
Most Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be [[sacramental character|neither repeated nor undone]]. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by [[irreligion|rejecting religion]] entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing debaptism.

(1 Peter 2:21) However, baptism does not guarantee salvation.<ref>''Worship the Only True God'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses (2002, 2006), "Chapter 12: The Meaning of Your Baptism", p. 118, "It would be a mistake to conclude that baptism is in itself a guarantee of salvation. It has value only if a person has truly dedicated himself to Jehovah through Jesus Christ and thereafter carries out God's will, being faithful to the end."</ref>

[However], fully valid baptisms have even been performed locally in large home bathtubs. ...Of course, it might be that in some extreme case baptism would seem absolutely impossible for the time being. Then we trust that our merciful heavenly Father will understand".</ref>

He taught that in baptism a child was cleansed of the guilt of original sin, initiated into the covenant with God, admitted into the church, made an heir of the divine kingdom, and spiritually born anew. He said that while baptism was neither essential to nor sufficient for salvation, it was the "ordinary means" that God designated for applying the benefits of the work of Christ in human lives. On the other hand, although he affirmed the regenerating grace of infant baptism, he also insisted upon the necessity of adult conversion for those who have fallen from grace. A person who matures into moral accountability must respond to God's grace in repentance and faith. Without personal decision and commitment to Christ, the baptismal gift is rendered ineffective. <br /> ''Baptism as Forgiveness of Sin''. In baptism God offers and we accept the forgiveness of our sin (Acts 2:38). With the pardoning of sin which has separated us from God, we are justified—freed from the guilt and penalty of sin and restored to right relationship with God. This reconciliation is made possible through the atonement of Christ and made real in our lives by the work of the Holy Spirit. We respond by confessing and repenting of our sin, and affirming our faith that Jesus Christ has accomplished all that is necessary for our salvation. Faith is the necessary condition for justification; in baptism, that faith is professed. God's forgiveness makes possible the renewal of our spiritual lives and our becoming new beings in Christ. <br /> ''Baptism as New Life''. Baptism is the sacramental sign of new life through and in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. Variously identified as regeneration, new birth, and being born again, this work of grace makes us into new spiritual creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17). We die to our old nature which was dominated by sin and enter into the very life of Christ who transforms us. Baptism is the means of entry into new life in Christ (John 3:5; Titus 3:5), but new birth may not always coincide with the moment of the administration of water or the laying on of hands. Our awareness and acceptance of our redemption by Christ and new life in him may vary throughout our lives. But, in whatever way the reality of the new birth is experienced, it carries out the promises God made to us in our baptism.|accessdate =August 2, 2007}}</ref><ref name="By Water and the Spirit – Personal Faith">{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=4&mid=992| title = By Water and the Spirit: A United Methodist Understanding of Baptism|publisher = [[The United Methodist Church]]|quote= The United Methodist Church does not accept either the idea that only believer's baptism is valid or the notion that the baptism of infants magically imparts salvation apart from active personal faith.|accessdate =August 2, 2007}}</ref>

==Other initiation ceremonies==
{{Main|Initiation}}
Many cultures practice or have practiced initiation rites, with or without the use of water, including the [[ancient Egyptian]], the [[Hebrews|Hebraic]]/Jewish, the [[Babylonia]]n, the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], and the [[Norsemen|Norse]] cultures. The modern Japanese practice of [[Miyamairi]] is such as ceremony that does not use water. In some, such evidence may be [[archaeology|archaeological]] and descriptive in nature, rather than a modern practice.

===Mystery religion initiation rites===
In the 20th century, it was common for scholars to draw parallels between rites from mystery religions and baptism in Christianity. [[Apuleius]], a 2nd-century [[Roman Empire|Roman]] writer, described an initiation into the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] of [[Isis]]. The initiation was preceded by a normal bathing in the public baths and a ceremonial sprinkling by the priest of Isis, after which the candidate was given secret instructions in the temple of the goddess. The candidate then fasted for ten days from meat and wine, after which he was dressed in linen and led at night into the innermost part of the sanctuary, where the actual initiation, the details of which were secret, took place. On the next two days, dressed in the robes of his consecration, he participated in feasting.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Apuleius |others=trans. E. J. Kenney |chapter=11.23|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=EF44Zv5yFUcC&pg=PA208 |title=The golden ass or Metamorphoses|publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=New York City |year=1998 |pages=208–210 |isbn=0-14-043590-5 |oclc=41174027|author-link=Apuleius }}</ref> Apuleius describes also an initiation into the cult of [[Osiris]] and yet a third initiation, of the same pattern as the initiation into the cult of Isis, without mention of a preliminary bathing.<ref>Apuleius, ''The Golden Ass'' (Penguin Books), pp. 211–214</ref> The water-less initiations of Lucius, the character in Apuleius's story who had been turned into an ass and changed back by Isis into human form, into the successive degrees of the rites of the goddess was accomplished only after a significant period of study to demonstrate his loyalty and trustworthiness, akin to [[catechumen]]al practices preceding baptism in Christianity.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Lars |last=Hartman |title=Into the Name of the Lord Jesus: Baptism in the Early Church |url=https://archive.org/details/intonamelordjesu00hart |url-access=limited |publisher=[[T&T Clark]]|location=[[Edinburgh]] |year=1997 |page=[https://archive.org/details/intonamelordjesu00hart/page/n14 4] |isbn=0-567-08589-9 |oclc=38189287}}</ref>

Since the 1950s, scholars have dismissed the alleged connection between mystery rites and baptism. Jan Bremmer has written on the putative connection between rites from mystery religions and baptism;

<blockquote>There are thus some verbal parallels between early Christianity and the Mysteries, but the situation is rather different as regards early Christian ritual practice. Much ink was spilled around 1900 arguing that the rituals of baptism and of the Last Supper derived from the ancient Mysteries, but Nock and others after him have easily shown that these attempts grossly misinterpreted the sources. Baptism is clearly rooted in Jewish purificatory rituals, and cult meals are so widespread in antiquity that any specific derivation is arbitrary. It is truly surprising to see how long the attempts to find some pagan background to these two Christian sacraments have persevered. Secularising ideologies clearly played an important part in these interpretations but, nevertheless, they have helped to clarify the relations between nascent Christianity and its surroundings.<ref>Bremmer, Jan. ''Initiation into the Mysteries of the Ancient World.'' De Gruyter, 2014, 152.</ref></blockquote>

===Gnostic Catholicism and Thelema===
The [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]], or Gnostic Catholic Church (the ecclesiastical arm of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]]), offers its Rite of Baptism to any person at least 11&nbsp;years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oto-usa.org/egc.html |title=US Grand Lodge, OTO: Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica |publisher=Oto-usa.org |date=March 19, 1933 |accessdate=February 25, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090305021017/http://oto-usa.org/egc.html| archivedate= March 5, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> The ceremony is performed before a [[Gnostic Mass]] and represents a symbolic birth into the [[Thelemic]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/bapadult.htm |title=Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica: Baptism: Adult |publisher=Hermetic.com |accessdate=February 25, 2009}}</ref>

===Baptism of objects===
[[File:USS Dewey christening.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Christening of {{USS|Dewey|DDG-105|6}}]]
The word "baptism" or "christening" is sometimes used to describe the inauguration of certain objects for use.

====Boats and ships====
{{see also|Ceremonial ship launching}}
''Baptism of Ships'': at least since the time of the [[Crusades]], rituals have contained a blessing for ships. The priest begs God to bless the vessel and protect those who sail in. The ship is usually sprinkled with [[holy water]].<ref name="cathen" />

====Church bells====
The name ''Baptism of Bells'' has been given to the blessing of ([[bell (instrument)|musical]], especially [[Church bell|church]]) bells, at least in France, since the 11th century. It is derived from the washing of the bell with [[holy water]] by the bishop, before he anoints it with the oil of the infirm without and with chrism within; a fuming [[censer]] is placed under it and the bishop prays that these [[sacramentals]] of the Church may, at the sound of the bell, put the demons to flight, protect from storms, and call the faithful to prayer.

====Dolls====
"Baptism of Dolls": the custom of 'dolly dunking' was once a common practice in parts of the United Kingdom, particularly in [[Cornwall]] where it has been revived in recent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cornishman.co.uk/pictures/PICTURES-Good-Friday-dolly-dunking-Fenton/pictures-26301254-detail/pictures.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216153107/http://www.cornishman.co.uk/pictures/PICTURES-Good-Friday-dolly-dunking-Fenton/pictures-26301254-detail/pictures.html |archivedate=December 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Yazidi baptism==
[[File:Baptîzma êzidiyan.jpg|thumb|Baptism of a [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] child in [[Lalish]]]]
The [[Yazidism#Religious practices|Yazidi]] baptism is called ''Mor kirin'' (literally: "to seal"). Traditionally, Yazidi children are baptised at birth with water from the ''Kaniya Sipî'' ("White Spring") at [[Lalish]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kreyenbroek|first=Philip G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4FpDDbrvqkC&pg=PA31|title=Yezidism in Europe: Different Generations Speak about Their Religion|date=2009|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-06060-8|language=en}}</ref>

==Mandaean baptism==
[[File:Mandaeans 01.jpg|thumb|Mandaeans undergoing baptism in living water]]
[[Mandaeans]] revere [[John the Baptist]] and practice frequent baptism (masbuta) as a ritual of purification, not of initiation. They are possibly the earliest people to practice baptism.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvv6I02MNlc</ref> Mandaeans undergo baptism on Sundays (''Habshaba''), wearing a white sacral robe (Rasta) and consists of a triple full immersion in water, a triple ''signing'' of the forehead with water and a triple drinking of water. The priest (Rabbi) then removes a ring made of myrtle worn by the baptized and places it on his/her forehead. This is then followed by a handshake (kushta-''hand of truth'') with the priest. Living water{{explain|date=April 2020}} is a requirement for baptism, therefore can only take place in rivers. All rivers are named ''Yardena'' [[Jordan River|(Jordan)]] and are believed to be nourished by the ''World of Light''. By the river bank, a Mandaean's forehead is anointed with sesame oil and partakes in a communion of bread and water. Baptism for Mandaeans allows for salvation by connecting with the ''World of Light'' and for forgiveness of sins.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/030609/9mandeans_2.htm |title=Mandeans |newspaper=US News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021205653/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/030609/9mandeans_2.htm |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Gnostic Ethics and Mandaean Origins | first = Edwin M | last = Yamauchi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bBccilWD5n0C&pg=PA20 | publisher = Gorgias Press | year=2004 | isbn = 978-1-931956-85-7 | page = 20}}</ref>
