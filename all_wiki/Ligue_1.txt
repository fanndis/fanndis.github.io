At the top of the [[French football league system]], it is the country's primary football competition. Administrated by the [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]], Ligue 1 is contested by 20 clubs and operates on a system of [[promotion and relegation]] from and to [[Ligue 2]].

Seasons run from August to May. Clubs play two matches against each of the other teams in the league – once home and once away – totalling to 38 matches over the course of the season. Most games are played on Saturdays and Sundays, with a few games played during weekday evenings. Play is regularly suspended the last weekend before [[Christmas]] for two weeks before returning in the second week of January. As of 2018, Ligue 1 is one of the top national leagues, outranked [[UEFA coefficient|fifth in Europe]] by Spain's [[La Liga]], England's [[Premier League]], Germany's [[Bundesliga]] and Italy's [[Serie A]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA rankings for club competitions|website=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|date=24 February 2018|url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/index.html|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>

Ligue 1 was inaugurated on 11 September 1932 under the name ''National'' before switching to ''Division 1'' after a year of existence. It continued to operate under that name until 2002, when it adopted its current name. [[AS Saint-Étienne]] is the most successful club with ten league titles in France while [[Olympique Lyonnais]] is the club that has won the most consecutive titles (seven between 2002 and 2008). With the presence of 69 seasons in Ligue 1, [[Olympique de Marseille]] hold the record for most seasons among the elite, while [[Paris Saint-Germain]] hold the league record for longevity with 45 consecutive seasons (from 1974 to present). The current champions are [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], who were awarded their ninth title in the [[2019–20 Ligue 1|2019–20 season]]. The league has been won on multiple occasions by foreign-based club [[AS Monaco]], which makes the league a cross-border competition.<ref>{{cite news |title=Prince Albert II, boss Leonardo Jardim hail Monaco's Ligue 1 title |url=https://global.espn.com/football/as-monaco/story/3128518/monacos-ligue-1-title-worth-four-of-paris-saint-germains-leonardo-jardim?src=com |accessdate=28 April 2020 |work=ESPN |date=18 May 2017}}</ref>

==History==

===Foundation===
[[Professional]]ism in [[Football in France|French football]] did not exist until July 1930, when the National Council of the [[French Football Federation]] voted 128–20 in favour of its adoption. The founders of professionalism in French football are Georges Bayrou, Emmanuel Gambardella, and [[Gabriel Hanot]]. Professionalism was officially implemented in 1932.

In order to successfully create a professional football league in the country, the Federation limited the league to twenty clubs. In order to participate in the competition, clubs were subjected to three important criteria:

* The incoming club must have had positive results in the past.
* The incoming club must be able to pull in enough revenue to balance its finances.
* The incoming club must be able to successfully recruit at least eight professional players.

Many clubs disagreed with the subjective criteria, most notably [[Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace|Strasbourg]], [[RC Roubaix]], [[Amiens SC]], and [[Stade Français Paris (football)|Stade Français]], while others like [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]], due to fear of bankruptcy, and [[Olympique Lillois]], due to a [[conflict of interest]], were reluctant to become professional. Olympique Lillois' president, Henri Jooris, also chairman of the Ligue du Nord, feared his league would fold and proposed it become the second division of the new league. Eventually, many clubs earned professional status, though it became more difficult to convince clubs in the northern half of the country; Strasbourg, RC Roubaix, and Amiens refused to accept the new league, while conversely [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]], [[Excelsior AC Roubaix]], [[FC Metz|Metz]], and [[SC Fives|Fives]] accepted professionalism. In southern France, clubs such as [[Olympique de Marseille]], [[Hyères FC|Hyères]], [[Montpellier HSC|SO Montpellier]], [[Nîmes Olympique|SC Nîmes]], [[AS Cannes|Cannes]], [[FC Antibes|Antibes]], and [[OGC Nice|Nice]] were extremely supportive of the new league and accepted their professional status without argument.

The league's inaugural season of the all-professional league, called ''National'', was held in [[1932–33 French Division 1|1932–1933]]. The 20 inaugural members of ''National'' were [[FC Antibes|Antibes]], [[CA Paris-Charenton|CA Paris]], [[AS Cannes|Cannes]], [[Club Français]], [[Excelsior AC Roubaix]], [[SC Fives|Fives]], [[Hyères FC|Hyères]], [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[FC Metz|Metz]], [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]], [[OGC Nice|Nice]], [[Nîmes Olympique|Nîmes]], [[Olympique Alès]], [[Olympique Lillois]], [[Racing Club de France football Colombes 92|Racing Club de France]], [[Red Star F.C.|Red Star Olympique]], [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]], [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]], [[FC Sète 34|Sète]], and [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]]. The 20 clubs were inserted into two groups of 10 with the bottom three of each group suffering relegation to Division 2. The two winners of each group would then face each other in a ''final'' held at a neutral venue, which later turned out to the [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir]]. The first final was held on 14 May 1933 and it matched the winner of Group A, Olympique Lillois, against the runner-up of Group B, Cannes. Antibes, the winner of Group B, was supposed to take part in the final but was suspected of bribery by the [[French Football Federation]] and was disqualified. In the first final, Lillois were crowned the inaugural champions following the club's 4–3 victory. After the season, the league decided to retain the 14 clubs and not promote any sides from the second division. The league also agreed to change its name from ''National'' to simply ''Division 1''. For the [[1934–35 French Division 1|1934–35 season]], the league organised a legitimate promotion and relegation system bringing the total tally of clubs in the first division to 16. The number remained until the [[1938–39 French Division 1|1938–39 season]].

Because of World War II, football was suspended by the French government and the Ligue de Football Professionnel, although its member clubs continued playing in regional competitions. During the "war championships", as they are called, professionalism was abolished by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and clubs were forced to participate in regional leagues, designated as ''Zone Sud'' and ''Zone Nord''. Due to its non-association with the two leagues, the LFP and FFF do not recognise the championships won by the clubs and thus 1939–1945 is non-existent in the two organisations' view. Following the conclusion of the war and the [[liberation of France]], professional football returned to France. The first division increased its allotment of clubs to 18. This number remained until the [[1965–66 French Division 1|1965–66 season]] when the number was increased to 20. In 2002, the league changed its name from ''Division 1'' to ''Ligue 1''.

==Competition format==

There are 20 clubs in Ligue 1. During the course of a season, usually from August to May, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 38 games, though special circumstances may allow a club to host matches at other venues such as when [[Lille OSC|Lille]] hosted [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] at the [[Stade de France]] in 2007 and 2008. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. For the 2015–16 season only, 2 teams were to be relegated and only 2 teams from Ligue 2 were to be promoted, but this decision was overturned and 3 teams were relegated and 3 teams promoted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ligue 1 reduces relegation spots to two|url=http://www.espnfc.us/french-ligue-1/story/2461334/ligue-1-reduces-relegation-spots-to-two| publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref>
Thus, it was the 2016–17 season which saw the return of a relegation play-off between the 18th-placed Ligue 1 team and the 3rd-placed team in the [[2016–17 Ligue 2|Ligue 2]] on a two-legged confrontation, with the Ligue 2 team hosting the first game.<ref>{{cite news |title=Les décisions du 14 avril 2016 |url=http://www.lfp.fr/corporate/article/les-decisions-du-14-avril-2016.htm | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel|lfp.fr]] |accessdate=30 April 2016 |date=14 April 2016|language = French}}</ref>

Previously, the league utilised a different promotion and relegation format. Prior to 1995, the league's format was direct relegation of the bottom two teams and a play-off between the third-last first-division team and the winner of the second-division play-offs, similar to the Dutch [[Eredivisie]], and the German [[Bundesliga]]. The league has also experimented with a "bonus" rule. From 1973 to 1976, a rule rewarded teams scoring three or more goals in a game with one extra point, regardless of outcome, with the objective of encouraging offensive play. The experience was ultimately inconclusive. At the start of the [[2006–07 Ligue 1|2006–07 season]], the league introduced an ''Attacking Play Table'' to encourage the scoring of more goals in Ligue 1 and [[Ligue 2]]. The LFP, with the help of the former manager [[Michel Hidalgo]] introduced the idea to reward those teams who score the most goals. The table was similar to the previous idea, but was independent from the official league table and clubs were only rewarded with monetary bonuses.

===European qualification===
As of the 2017–18 season, as determined by the [[UEFA coefficient]], the top three teams in Ligue 1 qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], with the top two proceeding directly to the group phase. The third-placed team enters in the third qualifying round. The fourth-placed team qualifies for the [[UEFA Europa League]]. The other two Europa League places are determined through the country's two domestic cup competitions, the [[Coupe de France]] and [[Coupe de la Ligue]]. If both of the cup winners qualify for Europe through their league position, the fifth- and sixth-placed teams in Ligue 1 will qualify for the Europa League.

==Clubs==
{{Main|List of Ligue 1 clubs}}
A total of 73 clubs have played in Ligue 1 from its foundation in the 1932–33 season to the start of the 2020–21 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bilan des clubs |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/bilanClubs |work=Ligue de Football Professionnel |accessdate=19 March 2010 |language=French |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019012700/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/bilanClubs |archivedate=19 October 2010 }}</ref> Currently, [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[FC Metz|Metz]], [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]], [[OGC Nice|Nice]], [[Nîmes Olympique|Nîmes]] and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] are the only founding members of the league to be playing in Ligue 1. [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] is the only club to have not suffered points relegation. They earned promotion to the first division for the 1974–75 season and has not faltered down since. Paris Saint-Germain was administratively relegated by the league following its split from [[Paris FC]] in 1972, but returned to the top flight two seasons later.

Internationally, the most well-known Ligue 1 clubs include [[Paris Saint-Germain]], [[Olympique Lyonnais]], [[Olympique de Marseille]], [[AS Monaco]], [[AS Saint-Etienne]], [[Lille OSC]] and [[Girondins de Bordeaux]].

<sup>a</sup>: Founding member of Ligue 1

==Finances==
{{Main|Direction Nationale du Contrôle de Gestion}}
Ligue 1 clubs' finances and budgets are managed by the [[Direction Nationale du Contrôle de Gestion|DNCG]], an organisation responsible for monitoring the accounts of professional association football clubs in France.<ref name="rules"/> It was founded in 1984 and is an administrative directorate of the [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] (LFP). The mission of the DNCG is to oversee all financial operations of the 44 member clubs of the LFP, develop the resources of professional clubs, apply sanctions to those clubs breaking the rules of operation, defend the morals and interests of French football in general.<ref name="rules">{{cite web|url=http://www.lfp.fr/reglements/pdf/statuts/DNCG.pdf |title=Rules of the DNCG |publisher=LFP |language=French |accessdate=1 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331205939/http://www.lfp.fr/reglements/pdf/statuts/DNCG.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2010 }}</ref>

Following a report by the DNCG, it was determined that the combined budget of Ligue 1 clubs was €910&nbsp;million for the 2005–06 season, a 39% increase from the [[2002–03 Ligue 1|2002–03 season]]. The prominent reason for the rise was mainly associated with the television rights deal the league regularly signs. Excluding [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], many of the top division clubs are extremely healthy with clubs such as [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]], [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], [[Lille OSC|Lille]], and [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] being referred to as "managed to perfection".<ref>{{cite news |title=Bordeaux and Lyon bring new wave of French optimism |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/mar/21/bordeaux-lyon-psg-france-ligue-1|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2010 | first=Amy | last=Lawrence}}</ref> However, recently the DNCG has encouraged clubs to concentrate on limiting their "skyrocketing wage bills and the magnitude of their debts" after it was discovered that the LFP clubs accounts as a whole were in the red for the third consecutive season (2008–2011) with an estimated deficit of €130&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Le foot français dans le rouge |url=http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/breves2010/20100424_105021_le-foot-francais-dans-le-rouge.html |work=France Football |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427062610/http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/breves2010/20100424_105021_le-foot-francais-dans-le-rouge.html |archivedate=27 April 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ligue 1 Focus – Money, money, money… |url=http://www.adifferentleague.co.uk/p6_48_1176_ligue-1-focus-money-money-money%E2%80%A6.html |work=A Different League |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=28 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421044814/http://www.adifferentleague.co.uk/p6_48_1176_ligue-1-focus-money-money-money%E2%80%A6.html |archivedate=21 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2012, the LFP announced that the clubs deficit had been cut in half from €130&nbsp;million to €65&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|title=65 millions d'euros de déficit en 2010-11 pour les clubs pros|url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/sport/dma_une_-65-millions-d-euros-de-deficit-en-2010-11-pour-les-clubs-pros_44096-2063857-fils_filDMA.Htm|work=Ouest-France|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=6 April 2012|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409023426/http://www.ouest-france.fr/sport/dma_une_-65-millions-d-euros-de-deficit-en-2010-11-pour-les-clubs-pros_44096-2063857-fils_filDMA.Htm|archive-date=9 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Ligue 1 ranks fifth in terms of revenue brought in by clubs with the league bringing in £0.6&nbsp;billion for the 2006–07 season trailing England, Italy, Spain, and Germany.<ref>{{cite news |title=PREMIER LEAGUE TOWERS OVER WORLD FOOTBALL, SAYS DELOITTE|url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/161923/premier-league-towers-over-world-football-says-deloitte|work=Sport Business|date=31 May 2007 |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref>

==Media coverage==
{{Main|List of Ligue 1 broadcasters}}
In France, the [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] had an exclusive broadcasting agreement with premium pay TV channels, [[Canal+]] and [[beIN Sports]]. The latter channel is operated by Qatar-based broadcaster [[Al Jazeera]]. The agreement with Al Jazeera, reached on 23 June 2011, pays the LFP €510 million over four seasons.<ref>{{cite news |title = Al Jazeera make move into Ligue 1 |agency=[[ESPN]] |date = 23 June 2011 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/930049/al-jazeera-make-tv-move-into-french-football?cc=5901 |accessdate= 3 April 2012 }}</ref> Following the announcement of the agreement, it was revealed that Canal+ had acquired four television packages, while beIN Sports acquired two packages.<ref>{{cite news |title = La LFP choisit Al Jazeera, comme prévu |agency=[[Eurosport]] |date = 26 January 2012 |url=http://www.eurosport.fr/football/ligue-1/2011-2012/la-lfp-choisit-al-jazeera_sto3126853/story.shtml |accessdate= 3 April 2012 | language = French }}</ref>

In 2018, [[Mediapro]] acquired three of the four major packages of LFP media rights for 2020-21 through 2024, largely replacing Canal+. beIN Sports maintains "lot 3", which contains two matches per-week on Saturday nights and Sunday afternoon. Mediapro was expected to establish a new channel to house these rights.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-05-30|title=Canal+ loses Ligue 1 football to Mediapro in major upset|url=https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2018/05/30/canal-loses-ligue-1-football-to-mediapro-in-major-upset/|access-date=2020-06-02|website=Digital TV Europe|language=en-GB}}</ref> In June 2020, Mediapro announced a partnership with [[TF1 Group|TF1]] to brand the new channel as [[Téléfoot (TV channel)|Téléfoot]]—an extension of TF1's long-running [[Téléfoot|football programme of the same name]]. As part of the agreement, Téléfoot will leverage TF1 talent and resources, with the programme's hosts [[Grégoire Margotton]] and [[Bixente Lizarazu]] serving as the lead broadcast team for at least 20 matches per-season.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-02|title=Mediapro and TF1 team up to launch Téléfoot channel|url=https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2020/06/02/mediapro-and-tf1-launch-telefoot-channel/|access-date=2020-06-02|website=Digital TV Europe|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ligue 1: la chaîne de Mediapro s'appellera " Téléfoot "|url=https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/ligue-1-la-chaine-de-mediapro-s-appellera-telefoot-1925487.html|access-date=2020-06-02|website=RMC SPORT|language=fr}}</ref>

==Awards==

===Trophy===
[[File:Hexagoal.jpg|thumb|right|Ligue 1 trophy: L'''Hexagoal''.]]
The current Ligue 1 trophy, ''L'Hexagoal'', was developed by the [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] and designed and created by Franco-Argentine artist [[Pablo Reinoso (designer)|Pablo Reinoso]]. The trophies has been awarded to the champion of France since the end of the [[2006–07 Ligue 1|2006–07 season]], replacing the previous Ligue 1 trophy that had existed for only five years. The name ''Hexagoal'' was derived from an official competition created by the LFP and French TV channel [[TF1]] to determine a name for the new trophy. Over 9,000 proposals were sent in and, on 20 May 2007, [[French Football Federation]] member Frédéric Thiriez announced that, following an online vote, the term ''Hexagoal'' had received half of the votes. The first club to hoist the new trophy was [[Olympique Lyonnais]] who earned the honour after winning the [[2007–08 Ligue 1|2007–08 season]].

===Monthly and annual===
{{Main|UNFP Player of the Month|Trophées UNFP du football}}
