=== Morning ===
Surveillance video which was publicly released in the 2017 documentary film ''Stranger Fruit'' shows Michael Brown walking into Ferguson Market and Liquor at 1:13&nbsp;a.m., ten and a half hours before he entered the store for the final time. The footage shows Brown handing a young clerk a brown package, believed by the filmmaker to be marijuana, and then receiving an unpurchased package of cigarillos from the store. After the video was rediscovered and made public in 2017, some, including Brown's family, said they believed Brown had left the package there for safekeeping and later returned to retrieve it. The store owner disputed this through an attorney who dismissed claims that the store traded him "cigarillos for pot." The lawyer claimed "[t]he reason he [Brown] gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they [the staff] wanted it back."<ref name=NYTimes.Wrinkle/> The store's attorney said the video had been in the hands of Brown's family and law enforcement since the initial investigation, and said the video had been edited to remove the portion where the store clerk returned Brown's package to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-market-disputes-claims-as-new-michael-brown-documentary-prompts/article_fc382406-dbd5-5f53-aeda-4de3f2d5d31e.html|title=Ferguson Market disputes claims as new Michael Brown documentary prompts new protest|work=stltoday.com|access-date=March 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313144849/http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-market-disputes-claims-as-new-michael-brown-documentary-prompts/article_fc382406-dbd5-5f53-aeda-4de3f2d5d31e.html|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Following this, on March 13, 2017, unedited footage from the store was released by the St. Louis County prosecutor to try to settle questions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-video-about-death-of-michael-brown-rekindles-unrest-arrests/article_d484096d-dbe1-5818-b2c7-4a7c21fad2f3.html|title=Ferguson video about death of Michael Brown rekindles unrest, arrests|last=Currier|first=Christine Byers, Joel|work=stltoday.com|date=March 14, 2017|access-date=June 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606061156/http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-video-about-death-of-michael-brown-rekindles-unrest-arrests/article_d484096d-dbe1-5818-b2c7-4a7c21fad2f3.html|archive-date=June 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Incident ==
At {{nowrap|11:47 a.m.}}, Wilson responded to a call about a baby with breathing problems and drove to Glenark Drive, east of Canfield Drive.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> About three minutes later and several blocks away, Brown was recorded on camera stealing a box of [[Swisher Sweets]] cigars and forcefully shoving a Ferguson Market clerk. Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, left the market at about {{nowrap|11:54 a.m.}}<ref name=KWMU.Know/> At 11:53, a police dispatcher reported "stealing in progress" at the Ferguson Market and described the suspect as a black male wearing a white T-shirt running toward [[QuikTrip]]. The suspect was reported as having stolen a box of Swisher cigars.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> At 11:57, the dispatch described the suspect as wearing a red [[St. Louis Cardinals]] hat, a white T-shirt, yellow socks, and khaki shorts, and that he was accompanied by another male.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> At {{nowrap|12:00 p.m.}}, Wilson reported he was back in service and radioed units 25 and 22 to ask if they needed his assistance in searching for the suspects.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> Seven seconds later, an unidentified officer said the suspects had disappeared.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> Wilson called for backup at 12:02, saying "[Unit] 21. Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car."<ref name=STLToday.Radio/>

Initial reports of what happened next differed widely among sources and witnesses, particularly with regard to whether Brown was moving towards Wilson when the shots were fired. At noon on {{nowrap|August 9}}, Wilson drove up to Brown and Johnson as they were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive and ordered them to move off the street. Wilson continued driving past the two men, but then backed up and stopped close to them.<ref name=CBS.Suspect/><ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/><ref name=IBTimes.Johnson/><ref name=USAToday.Cigars/> A struggle took place between Brown and Wilson after Brown reached through the window of the police SUV, a [[Chevrolet Tahoe#Police package|Chevrolet Tahoe]].<ref name=NYTimes.Recount/>  Wilson was armed with a [[SIG Sauer P229]]<ref name=WashPost.Chaos/> pistol, which was fired twice during the struggle from inside the vehicle, with one bullet hitting Brown's right hand.<ref name=NYTimes.Recount/><ref name=WashPost.Chaos/> Brown and Johnson fled and Johnson hid behind a car.<ref name=CNN.Shooting/> Wilson got out of the vehicle and pursued Brown.<ref name=NYTimes.Happened/> At some point, Wilson fired his gun again, while facing Brown, and hit him with at least 6 shots, all in the front of his body.<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> Brown was unarmed and died on the street.<ref name=NYTimes.Recount/><ref name=CNN.Violence/> Less than 90 seconds passed from the time Wilson encountered Brown to the time of Brown's death.<ref name=Newsweek.90Seconds/><ref name=NYTimes.90Seconds/>

An unidentified officer arrived on the scene and, 73 seconds after Wilson's call, asked where the second suspect was. Thirty-one seconds later, a supervisor was requested by Unit 25. At {{nowrap|12:07 p.m.}}, an officer on scene radioed to dispatch for more units.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> Also at 12:07, the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County police were notified and county officers began arriving on scene at around {{nowrap|12:15 p.m.}} The {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County detectives were notified at {{nowrap|12:43 p.m.}} and arrived about {{nowrap|1:30 p.m.}}, with the forensic investigator arriving at about {{nowrap|2:30 p.m.}}<ref name=NYTimes.Body/>

Police dispatched a dozen units to the scene by {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} with another dozen, including two canine units, by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} Gunshots were recorded in Ferguson police logs at {{nowrap|2:11 p.m.}}, and by the ambulance dispatch again at {{nowrap|2:14 p.m.}}, which led to the response of 20 units from eight different municipal forces in the next 20 minutes. As the situation deteriorated, the police commanders had investigators seek cover and detectives assisted in crowd control. At {{nowrap|2:45}}, four canine units arrived on scene, and the [[SWAT]] team arrived at {{nowrap|3:20 p.m.}}<ref name=STLToday.LeftThere/> The medical examiner began his examination at around {{nowrap|3:30 p.m.}} and concluded about half an hour later, with the body being cleared to be taken to the morgue.<ref name=STLToday.LeftThere/><ref name=Newsweek.Scene/> At {{nowrap|4:37 p.m.}}, Brown's body was signed in by workers at the morgue.<ref name=STLToday.LeftThere/>

== Investigations ==

===Police===
Brown was fatally shot by Wilson at about 12:02&nbsp;p.m. The Ferguson Police Department was on the scene within minutes, as were crowds of residents, some expressing hostility toward the police. Paramedics covered the body with sheets. About {{nowrap|20 minutes}} after the shooting, the Ferguson Police Chief turned over the homicide investigation to the St. Louis County Police Department (SLCPD). The arrival of SLCPD detectives took about {{nowrap|70 minutes}}, as they were occupied with another crime scene {{nowrap|37 minutes}} away. On arrival at 1:30&nbsp;p.m., they put up privacy screens around the body. Their investigation was slowed due to safety concerns regarding the sound of gunfire in the area and some hostile members of the crowd encroaching on the crime scene. An investigator from the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office arrived at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. Brown's body was removed at 4:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{harvnb |USDOJ |2015 | pages=8–9}}, Section B.

===Department of Justice===
On {{nowrap|August 11}}, 2014, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) opened a civil rights investigation into the incident.<ref name=WashPost.FBI/>  A spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis field office said the decision to open an investigation was not motivated by the protests and riots which had ensued.<ref name=NBC.FBI/> Forty FBI agents went door-to-door looking for potential witnesses who may have had information about the shooting.<ref name="Fox.Curfew" />  Additionally, attorneys from the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights Division]] and from the [[United States Attorney|United States Attorney's Office]] were participating in the investigation.<ref name="Vox.FBI" />

On {{nowrap|March 4}}, 2015, the federal investigation cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. The investigation concluded there was no evidence upon which prosecutors could rely to disprove Wilson's asserted belief that he feared for his safety, that witnesses who contradicted Wilson were not credible, that forensic evidence and credible witnesses corroborated Wilson's account, and that the facts did not support the filing of criminal charges against Wilson.<ref name=Yahoo.Feds/><ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/>{{sfn |USDOJ |2015 | p=12}} Credible witnesses did not support accounts that Brown had his hands up in surrender. He was not shot in the back. Forensic evidence showed he was moving toward Wilson. Numerous witnesses were found to have given accounts of actions they were unable to see from their vantage points, or to be recounting others' accounts.<ref name=Yahoo.Feds/><ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/>{{sfn |USDOJ |2015 | p=12}}

===2020: New prosecutor===
A new St. Louis prosecutor, Wesley Bell, spent five months in 2020 secretly reviewing the case with an eye to charging Wilson with either manslaughter or murder.<ref>{{cite news |title=Prosecutors again decline to charge police officer who shot Michael Brown six years ago |url=https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-07-30/prosecutor-no-charges-for-officer-in-michael-browns-death |accessdate=1 August 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |agency=Associated Press |date=30 July 2020 |language=en |quote=Could we prove beyond a reasonable doubt that when Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown he committed murder or manslaughter under Missouri law?

==Grand jury hearing==
The [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] was made up of members who had been impaneled in May 2014 for a regularly scheduled term, to hear all cases put forward by the prosecuting attorney's office. There were three black (one man and two women) and nine white members (six men and three women), an ethnic breakdown that roughly reflects the [[Race (human classification)|racial]] makeup of {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County,<ref name=STLToday.Jury/> which is about 30% black, and 70% white.<ref name=CSM.Deliberations/> On {{nowrap|August 20}}, 2014, the grand jury started hearing evidence in the case ''State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson'', in order to decide whether a crime was committed and if there was probable cause to believe Wilson committed it.<ref name=LATimes.Grand/>

There was intense interest focused on the grand jury. [[Bob McCulloch (prosecutor)|Robert P. McCulloch]], the elected prosecuting attorney for {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County, was in charge of the prosecution but did not participate in the direct handling of the grand jury hearing.<ref name=STLAmerican.Struggle/><ref name=WashPost.Outcome/><ref name=NYer.HowNot/> It was handled by two Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys of McCulloch's office: Kathi Alizadeh and Sheila Whirley.<ref name=WashPost.Outcome/> McCulloch announced an unusual process: the grand jury would hear all the evidence, the proceedings would be transcribed, and the materials would be made public if the grand jury did not indict.<ref name=WashPost.Fair/>

The grand jury took 25 days, over the span of three months, to hear more than 5,000 pages of testimony from 60 witnesses and then deliberate on whether or not to indict Wilson.<ref name=WashPost.Fair/><ref name=USAToday.Charges/><!-- Ref bundle --> Most grand juries complete their work in a matter of days.<ref name=WashPost.Fair/> The grand jury was not [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] during the process.<ref name=NPR.Examining/> <!--On {{nowrap|September 16}}, Wilson testified before the grand jury for more than four hours and, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation{{who|date=November 2014}}, Wilson was "cooperative".

On the night of {{nowrap|November 24}}, Prosecutor McCulloch reported in a 20-minute press conference that the grand jury had reached a decision in the case and would not indict Wilson.<ref name=CNN.Fires/>

Following his announcement, McCulloch released thousands of pages of grand jury documents, with materials published on the internet for public perusal.<ref name=NPR.Testimony/> The documents include transcripts of the proceedings, expert statements, and the testimony of some witnesses.<ref name=SeattleTimes.Evidence/> On {{nowrap|December 8}}, more witness interviews and more than 50 brief audio recordings between the police dispatchers and responding police officers were released.<ref name=NYTimes.Audio/> On {{nowrap|December 13}}, a third release included the transcripts of witness interviews, including one with Dorian Johnson.<ref name=NYTimes.Files/> A video of the two-hour interview of Johnson by FBI and county police was withheld.<ref name=DFP.Withheld/><ref name=ABC.Federal/>

Robert P. McCulloch was the main focus of much of the criticism throughout the process and well into its aftermath. Attorney Raul Reyes characterized McCulloch as not being impartial, as his father was a police officer killed in an incident with a black suspect and other members of his family served with the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} Police Department.<ref name=CNN.Unfair/>  A petition calling for McCulloch to recuse himself gained 70,000 signatures.<ref name=NBC.Petition/><ref name=STLToday.Controversy/><ref name=NYTimes.Objectivity/><ref name=STLToday.Petitions/> Governor Jay Nixon declined to remove McCulloch and said doing so would potentially jeopardize the prosecution.<ref name=STLToday.Remove/> McCulloch dismissed the claims of bias, and later said he regretted not speaking publicly about his background at the time.<ref name=WashPost.Outcome/><ref name=KTRS.McGraw/>

Legal analysts raised concerns over McCulloch's unorthodox approach, <!-- Explain normal process and role of prosecutor -->saying this process could have influenced the grand jury to decide against indictment and that they were given too much material to assess.<ref name=USAToday.Probe/><ref name=LATimes.Strategy/> The analysts highlighted the significant differences between a typical grand jury proceeding in Missouri and how Wilson's case was handled.<ref name=NYTimes.Happened/>

== Evidence ==

===Shooting scene===
Evidence presented to the grand jury showed that the shooting scene extended approximately {{Convert|184|ft}} along Canfield Drive, near where it intersects Copper Creek Court. The two-lane street runs east to west, and has sidewalks and curbs on both sides. Immediately prior to the incident, Brown was walking eastbound on Canfield and Wilson was driving westbound. Evidence at the scene was generally clustered around Wilson's SUV on the western side of the scene and near Brown's body, which was in the eastern part of the area.
{{wide image|Michael Brown shooting scene diagram.svg|1000px|Diagram of the shooting scene{{R|STLToday.Map|NYTimes.Documents|NYTimes.Happened|WashPost.Collected}}}}

The {{Convert|30|ft|adj=on}} western area included Wilson's police vehicle, which was angled slightly toward the right curb with its left-rear corner on the center line. Evidence included two bracelets, a baseball cap, and two [[.40 S&W|.40 caliber]] spent [[Cartridge (firearms)|casings]]. One of these casings was found at the western edge of the scene and the other was located near the rear driver's side of the police vehicle. There were two groups of red stains near the driver's side of the vehicle and a left [[flip-flops|sandal]] was also located in the vicinity. The right sandal was approximately {{Convert|44|ft}} east of the western area.

The eastern area, which was approximately {{Convert|124|ft}} east of the western area, was about {{Convert|29|ft}} wide. Brown's body was situated along the center-line of the road with his head oriented in a westerly direction. The distance from the driver's door of the SUV to Brown's head was about {{Convert|153|ft}}. Two groups of red stains were located at the extreme eastern edge of the scene, with the furthest under {{Convert|22|ft}} from Brown's feet.

One apparent projectile was found near the body. There were ten spent {{nowrap|.40-caliber}} casings scattered on the south side of the road near Brown's body. The distribution of the casings, combined with most of the casings being east of the body, was consistent with the officer moving backward while firing.<ref name=NYTimes.Documents/> Blood spatter approximately 25 feet behind Brown's body suggested he was moving toward Wilson when he was killed.<ref name=NYTimes.Happened/><ref name=NYTimes.Trusting/>

=== DNA ===
Brown's DNA was found on the gun. His DNA was also found on the left thigh of Wilson's pants and on the inside driver's door handle of Wilson's police SUV,<ref name=WashPost.Chaos/> the result of Brown's spilled blood staining Wilson's pants and the door handle.<ref name=PPH.Tussle/> Wilson's DNA was found on Brown's left palm but was not found under Brown's fingernails or on his right hand.<ref name=WashPost.Chaos/>

Michael Graham, the St. Louis medical examiner, said blood was found on Wilson's gun and inside the car, and tissue from Brown was found on the exterior of the driver's side of Wilson's vehicle; this evidence was consistent with a struggle at that location. According to Judy Melinek, a San Francisco pathologist who commented on the case as an expert, the official autopsy, which said Brown's hand had foreign matter consistent with a gun discharge on it, supported Wilson's testimony that Brown was reaching for the weapon,<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/> or indicated the gun was inches away from Brown's hand when it went off.<ref name=WashPost.Chaos/>

According to the detective who performed tests on the gun, he had to decide whether to perform a DNA test or dust for fingerprints, because only one test can be performed without affecting the other.<ref name=WashPost.Chaos/> He found the gun stored in an unsealed envelope, contrary to the customary evidence-handling protocol.<ref name=WSJ.Testimony/> Documents released after the grand jury proceedings show Wilson washed blood from his hands and checked his own gun into an evidence bag, both actions described by media outlets as unorthodox procedures for such a case.<ref name=STLToday.Tidbits/><ref name=WashPost.Unorthodox/>

}} were performed on Brown's body, with all three noting Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. He received no shots in his back.<ref name=WashPost.Friend/>

The county autopsy report described gunshot entry and exit wounds to Brown's right arm coming from both the front ([[Dorsoventral|ventral]], [[Standard anatomical position|palms facing forward]]) and the back (dorsal, palms facing backward).<ref name=County.Autopsy/>

====County====
The local medical examiner autopsy report released to state prosecutors said Brown was shot in the front part of his body. When Mary Case, the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County medical examiner, was asked to provide details, she declined to comment further, citing the ongoing investigation into Brown's death.<ref name=NYTimes.Accounts/><ref name=WashPost.County/> The official county autopsy was later leaked to the ''{{nowrap|St. Louis}} Post-Dispatch''.<ref name=PBS.Autopsy/><ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>

The narrative report of investigation from the office of the medical examiner of {{nowrap|St. Louis}} agreed with Wilson's testimony.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/> It noted Brown had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the head, torso, and right arm, as well as a single gunshot wound to the inside of his right hand near his thumb and palm; it also noted Brown's body had [[abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] to the right side of his face and on the back of his left hand.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>

The autopsy noted the absence of [[stippling]], powder burns around a wound that indicate a shot was fired at a relatively short range. Michael Graham notes gunshot wounds within an inch of the body do not always cause stippling. Microscopic examination of tissue taken from the thumb wound detected the presence of a foreign material consistent with the material which is ejected from a gun while firing.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/> The gunshot wound to the top of Brown's head was consistent with Brown either falling forward or being in a lunging position; the shot was instantly fatal.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>

A toxicology test performed by a {{nowrap|St. Louis}} University laboratory revealed the presence of [[THC]], the active ingredient in [[marijuana]], in Brown's blood and urine. This indicated he used marijuana within a few hours of his death, but not whether he was impaired when he died.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>

====Independent====
At the request of Brown's family, on {{nowrap|August 17}} a preliminary autopsy was conducted by [[Michael Baden]], a former chief medical examiner for the City of New York (1978–1979). This autopsy was limited because the previous county autopsy had washed, embalmed, and taken evidence off the body.<ref name=KTVI.Baden/><ref name=USAToday.Pathologist/><ref name=CNN.Transcript/><ref name=PBS.Evidence/>

According to Baden's report, Brown was shot six times into his front: four of the bullets entered his right arm, one entered his right eye on a downward trajectory, and one entered the top of his skull.<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> All of the rounds were fired from a distance of at least one foot.<ref name=LATimes.Autopsy/> One of the shots shattered his right eye, traveled through his face, then exited his jaw and reentered his collarbone. Brown could have survived the first bullet wounds, but the bullet that entered the top of his head resulted in a fatal injury.<ref name=SeattleTimes.Hands/><ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/>

Baden had no access to the clothing of the victim, and had not yet seen the x-rays showing where bullets were in the body. He could not determine if any gunpowder residue was on that clothing. Baden concluded there was too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> At least two commentators noted the results of both autopsies contradicted some aspects of some eyewitness accounts, which had reported Wilson shot Brown in the back<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> and that Wilson shot Brown while holding Brown's neck.<ref name=WashPost.Autopsy/> In later analysis, Baden reclassified one of Brown's chest wounds as an entry wound.<ref name=KSDK.Crump/>

Baden was assisted by [[Shawn Parcells]], who did not have a degree or credentials in medicine or pathology.<ref name=WDAF.Credentials/><ref name=KCStar.Assistant/> Thomas Young, former [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] Medical Examiner, said Parcells gave out forensic pathology opinions when he is not qualified to do so.<ref name=WDAF.Credentials/> Mary Case, who performed the initial autopsy, said Parcells' involvement could cause issues with the second autopsy.<ref name=KMBC.Pathologist/> Parcells said all he did was assist Baden.<ref name=KMBC.Pathologist/>

====Federal====
Attorney General Holder ordered a third autopsy of Brown's body.<ref name=STLToday.Holder/><ref name=CBS.Autopsy/> Its findings matched the other two autopsies, but its detailed findings were initially withheld from the public due to the ongoing investigation.<ref name=NYTimes.Accounts/><ref name=LATimes.Documents/> The federal autopsy report was among a group of documents released by the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Prosecutor's Office on {{nowrap|December 8}}, two weeks after the grand jury chose not to indict Wilson.<ref name=LATimes.Documents/><ref name=LATimes.FederalAutopsy/>

===Audio recording of gunshots===
On {{nowrap|August 27}}, CNN released an audio recording purported to contain the sounds of the shooting.<ref name=CNN.Analyzing/><ref name=CNN.Audio/> The recording was made by an anonymous third-party who happened to be recording a video-text message at the time of the incident.<ref name=NBC.Probing/> [[Glide (software)|Glide]], a video messaging service, confirmed the audio had been recorded on their site at {{nowrap|12:02 p.m.}} on the day of the shooting.<ref name=CNN.Captured/><ref name=Glide.Verifies/> The twelve-second recording contains a series of shots, a short pause, and then a second series of shots.<ref name=NBC.Probing/>

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg says he heard six shots, a pause, and then four additional shots. Ginsberg said, "I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up."<ref name=CNN.Audio/> CNN's law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes noted most accounts of the shooting say there was a single shot earlier in the incident near the vehicle that is not audible in the recording.<ref name=CNN.Alleged/><ref name=WashPost.Audio/> The recording was also analyzed by [[ShotSpotter|SST, Inc.]], a company specializing in [[gunfire locator]] technology. That analysis found the sound of ten gunshots and seven gunshot echoes within seven seconds, with a three-second pause after the sixth shot. The company's analysis also said all ten rounds were fired from within a radius of {{convert|3|ft|m}}, indicating the shooter was not moving.<ref name=WashPost.Acoustic/>

=== Handling ===

''The Washington Post'' said there were unorthodox forensic practices shown in the published testimony of Wilson and other law enforcement officials. It said Wilson washed blood off of his hands without photographing them first. It also said Wilson submitted his gun to evidence by himself, and that initial interviews of Wilson were conducted with other personnel present and were not taped. It described Wilson's face injuries after the shooting as photographed by a local detective at the Fraternal Order of Police building, instead of at Ferguson Police headquarters. An investigator with the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Medical Examiner's office testified he decided not to take measurements at the crime scene nor did he photograph the scene, instead relying on photographs taken by the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Police Department.<ref name=BostonGlobe.Unorthodox/>

== Witness accounts ==

Multiple witnesses saw part or all of the event and have given interviews to the media, testified to the grand jury, and were interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice.  The witness accounts were conflicting on various points.<ref name=NYTimes.Accounts/><ref name=IBTimes.Accounts/><ref name=HLN.Accounts/><ref name=CNN.Narratives/><ref name=LATimes.Witnesses/><ref name=KTVI.Stories/> David A. Klinger, a [[criminologist]] at the [[University of Missouri–St. Louis|University of Missouri–{{nowrap|St. Louis}}]], said eyewitness testimony often differs from witness to witness, a phenomenon commonly known as the [[Rashomon effect]].<ref name=STLToday.Witness/>

An [[Associated Press]] review of the grand jury found numerous problems in the witness testimony, including statements that were "inconsistent, fabricated, or provably<!-- "PROVABLY" IS CORRECT PER SOURCE. DO NOT CHANGE TO "PROBABLY". --> wrong". Several of the witnesses admitted changing their testimony to fit released evidence, or other witness statements.<ref name=AP.Papers/> Prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch said, "I thought it was important to present anybody and everybody, and some that were, yes, clearly not telling the truth, no question about it."<ref name=Guardian.Lied/>

The Department of Justice investigation into the shooting determined witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account were credible while those who contradicted his account were not. The witnesses that claimed Brown was surrendering or did not move toward Wilson were not credible; the report said their claims were inconsistent with the physical evidence, other witness statements, and in some cases prior statements from the same witness. No witness statements that pointed to Wilson's guilt were determined to be credible. Twenty-four statements were determined to lack any credibility, while eight which were found credible corroborated Wilson's account. Nine did not completely contradict nor corroborate Wilson's account.<ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/> Several witnesses reported fear of reprisals from the community for providing evidence that corroborated Wilson's account.<ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/>

===Wilson's interview and testimony===
[[File:Darren wilson bruise.jpg|thumb|Bruising on Wilson's face after the shooting]]
Wilson gave his account of the incident in an interview with a detective on {{nowrap|August 10}}, and in testimony before the grand jury in September. Wilson said he had just left a call involving a sick person when he heard on his radio that there was a theft in progress at a local convenience store. Wilson heard the description of the suspects and soon after observed two black males walking down the middle of the street. Wilson pulled up to them and told the two to walk on the sidewalk, and Johnson replied, "we're almost to our destination". As they passed his window, Brown said "fuck what you have to say".<ref name=CBS.Documents/>

Wilson then backed up about ten feet to where they were and attempted to open his door. After backing up, Wilson told the two to "come here", and Brown told him in reply, "what the fuck are you gonna do". Wilson shut the door and Brown approached him and he opened the door again "trying to push him back", while telling him to get back. Brown "started swinging and punching at me from outside the vehicle", and Brown had his body against the door. Wilson said the first strike from Brown was a "glancing blow", and at that point he was trying to get Brown's arms out of his face. This was when Brown turned to his left and handed Johnson several packs of the stolen cigarillos he had been holding.<ref name=CBS.Documents/> Wilson then grabbed Brown's right arm trying to get control, but Brown hit him in the face. Wilson said he "felt like a 5-year-old holding onto [[Hulk Hogan]]" while he attempted to restrain Brown when he reached through his police car window.<ref name=Bloomberg.HulkHogan/> Wilson said it "jarred" him back and he yelled at Brown numerous times to stop and get back. Wilson said he thought about using his mace and his [[Expandable baton|baton]], but he was unable to reach either of them. He then drew his weapon and pointed it at Brown and told him to stop or he would shoot him, while ordering him to the ground.<ref name=CBS.Documents/>

According to Wilson, Brown then said "you're too much of a fucking pussy to shoot me" and grabbed for his gun and twisted it, pointing it at him, into his hip area. Wilson placed his left hand against Brown's hand and his other hand on the gun and pushed forward with both his arms. The gun was somewhat lined up with Brown, and Wilson pulled the trigger twice, but the weapon failed to discharge. On the next try, the gun fired and Brown then attempted to hit him multiple times inside his vehicle. Wilson shot at Brown again, but missed, and Brown took off running east, while Wilson exited his vehicle and radioed for backup. Wilson followed Brown, yelling for him to stop and get on the ground, but he kept running. Brown eventually stopped and turned and made a "grunting noise" and started running at him with his right hand under his shirt in his waistband. Brown ignored Wilson's commands to stop and get on the ground, so Wilson fired multiple shots at him, paused, and yelled at him to get on the ground again, but Brown was still charging at him and had not slowed down. Wilson then fired another set of shots, but Brown was still running at him. When Brown was about eight to ten feet away, Wilson fired more shots, with one of those hitting Brown in the head, which brought him down with his hand still in his waistband. Wilson said two patrol cars showed up approximately fifteen to twenty seconds after the final shot. When his supervisor arrived, he was sent to the police station.<ref name=CBS.Documents/>

Wilson told detectives Brown had reached his right hand into his waistband and that the hand still appeared to be in the waistband after Brown was shot. The medical investigator at the scene of the shooting did not take any photographs and testified to the grand jury that Brown's left hand was under his dead body, near the waistband, and the right hand was extended outwards.<ref name=CNN.Testimony/>

On {{nowrap|November 26}}, Wilson gave his first public interview about the shooting to [[ABC News]]' [[George Stephanopoulos]].<ref name=ABC.Discusses/>

===Corroborating Wilson's testimony===
Numerous witness accounts were consistent with Wilson's account and also agreed with the physical evidence at hand. Many witnesses corroborated that Wilson acted in self-defense during the event. A number of the witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account of events expressed fear and apprehension in testifying, saying they had been harassed or threatened by individuals from the Ferguson community.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.27–34}} The following are a sample of the witnesses whose accounts aligned with Wilson's testimony.

Witness 102 was a 27-year-old biracial male. He said he saw Wilson chase Brown until Brown abruptly turned around. Brown did not put his hands up in surrender but made some type of movement similar to pulling his pants up or a shoulder shrug and then made a full charge at Wilson. Witness 102 thought Wilson's life was threatened and he only fired shots when Brown was coming toward him.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.27–28}}

After the shooting, Witness 102 remained in the neighborhood for a short period of time, and corrected a couple of people who claimed Wilson "stood over [Brown] and shot while [he was] on the ground". In response, Witness 102 said Wilson shot Brown because Brown came back toward Wilson. Witness 102 "kept thinking" Wilson's shots were "missing" Brown because Brown kept moving.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.28}} Witness 102 did not stay in the neighborhood for long, and left the area shortly afterward because he felt uncomfortable. According to the witness, "crowds of people had begun to gather, wrongly claiming the police shot Brown for no reason and that he had his hands up in surrender". Two black women approached Witness 102, mobile phones set to record, asking him to recount what he had witnessed. Witness 102 responded that they would not like what he had to say. The women responded with racial slurs, calling him names like 'white motherfucker'."<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.28}}

Witness 103, a 58-year-old black male, testified that from his parked truck he saw "Brown punching Wilson at least three times in the facial area, through the open driver's window of the SUV... Wilson and Brown [had] hold of each other's shirts, but Brown was 'getting in a couple of blows [on Wilson]'."<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.29}} Wilson was leaning back toward the passenger seat with his forearm up, in an effort to block the blows. Then Witness 103 heard a gunshot and Brown took off running. Wilson exited the SUV, appeared to be using his shoulder microphone to call into his radio, and chased Brown with his gun held low ... Brown came to a stop near a car, put his hand down on the car, and turned around to face Wilson. Brown's hands were then down at his sides. Witness 103 did not see Brown's hands up. Wanting to leave, Witness 103 began to turn his car around in the opposite direction that Brown had been running when he heard additional shots. Witness 103 turned to his right, and saw Brown "moving fast" toward Wilson. Witness 103 then drove away."<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.29}}

Witness 104, a 26-year-old biracial female, witnessed the end of the altercation from a minivan:

<blockquote>[Witness 104] saw Brown run from the SUV, followed by Wilson, who "hopped" out of the SUV and ran after him while yelling "stop, stop, stop". Wilson did not fire his gun as Brown ran from him. Brown then turned around and "for a second" began to raise his hands as though he may have considered surrendering, but then quickly "balled up in fists" in a running position and "charged" at Wilson. Witness 104 described it as a "tackle run", explaining Brown "wasn't going to stop". Wilson fired his gun only as Brown charged at him, backing up as Brown came toward him. Witness 104 explained there were three separate volleys of shots. Each time, Brown ran toward Wilson, Wilson fired, Brown paused, Wilson stopped firing, and then Brown charged again. The pattern continued until Brown fell to the ground, "smashing" his face upon impact. Wilson did not fire while Brown momentarily had his hands up. Witness 104 explained it took some time for Wilson to fire, adding that she "would have fired sooner". Wilson did not go near Brown's body after Brown fell to his death.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.30}}</blockquote>

Witness 108, a 74-year-old black male, told detectives the police officer was "in the right" and "did what he had to do", and that statements made by people in the apartment complex about Brown surrendering were inaccurate. Witness 108 later told investigators he "would have fucking shot that boy, too", and mimicked the aggressive stance Brown made while charging Wilson. He explained Wilson told Brown to "stop" or "get down" at least ten times, but instead Brown "charged" at Wilson. Witness 108 also told detectives there were other witnesses on Canfield Drive who saw what he saw.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.32}}

Witness 109, a 53-year-old black male, said he decided to come forward after seeing Dorian Johnson "lie" about the events on television.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.32}} He said when Wilson asked the two boys to get out of the street, Brown responded something to the effect of "Fuck the police." Afterward, Wilson got out of his car and Brown hit him in the face. Witness 109 said he saw Wilson reach for his taser but dropped it and then grabbed a gun, after which Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun. According to 109, at one point Brown ran away from Wilson, but turned around and charged toward the officer. He said Wilson fired in self-defense, and did not appear to be shooting to kill at first.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.33}}

Witness 113, a 31-year-old black female, made statements that corroborated Wilson's account. She said she was afraid of the "neighborhood backlash" that might come from her testimony, and feared offering an account contrary to the narrative reported by the media that Brown held his hands up in surrender.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.33–34}} She also told investigators she thought Wilson's life was in danger.

Witness 136 was in his apartment using a video chat application on his mobile phone while the shooting occurred. After hearing the first few shots, he recorded the remainder of his chat on his phone and turned it over to the FBI. The recording is about 12 seconds long and captured a total of 10 gunshots. The gunshots begin after the first four seconds. The recording captured six gunshots in two seconds. After a three-second pause, a seventh gunshot is heard. A pause of less than one second gave way to the final three-shot volley within two seconds. The recording was not time-stamped. As detailed below, this recording is consistent with several credible witness accounts as well as Wilson's account, that he fired several volleys of shots, briefly pausing between each one.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.24–25}}

===Contradicting Wilson's testimony===
Several witnesses who originally testified against Wilson were also interviewed by the prosecution. They admitted to lying under oath as to the truthfulness of their testimony.<ref name=WJLA.Lied/><ref name=HuffPost.Lied/> At least one witness took an account from a newspaper; this witness was later discredited by investigators during the process.<ref name=HuffPost.Lied/>

Witness 22, who originally claimed she saw Wilson kill Brown in cold blood, admitted she lied to investigators and never saw the incident at all. She said she was just passing along information which her boyfriend told her he saw.<ref name=WJLA.Lied/><ref name=CNN.Credibility/><ref name=WashPost.Inconsistency/> The court transcript reads:

{{quote|'''Prosecution''': You gave two statements, were both of those statements true?

'''Witness 22''': No. I just felt like I want to be part of something... I didn't see what I told the FBI what [''sic''] I saw.|sign=|source=}}

Prosecutors also played the grand jury a 10-minute police interview with a man who claimed to have witnessed the shooting. They then played a phone call in which that man admitted he actually had not seen the incident at all.<ref name=CNN.Credibility/> Another witness insisted another officer was with Wilson at the time of the shooting. By all other accounts, Wilson was the only officer present when he shot Brown. This witness described having a clear view of what transpired despite there being a building between the witness' location and where the incident took place.<ref name=CNN.Credibility/>

Witness 35 said Brown was "on his knees" when Wilson shot him in the head. Under questioning, his testimony fell apart, and he admitted fabricating it.<ref name=CNN.Credibility/>

{{quote|'''Prosecution''': What you are saying you saw isn't forensically possible based on the evidence. Are you telling us that the only thing that's true about all of your statements before this is that you saw that police officer shoot him at point blank range?
 
'''Witness 35''': Yes.<ref name=CNN.Credibility/>}}

Another witness described Brown on his hands and knees pleading for his life. After a prosecutor confronted the witness and told them what they had seen was not forensically possible based on the evidence, the witness later asked to leave.<ref name=CNN.Credibility/>

Another witness—number 37—testified that, during a confrontation at Wilson's vehicle, Wilson shot Brown point blank in the chest—but Brown did not fall over and was not clearly bleeding as he ran away. This witness gave several different accounts of how many shots were fired. While he was further pressed for answers as to the truthfulness of his statements, he instead posed questions in return, refusing to elaborate on his statements.

{{quote|'''Prosecution''': You told three different stories in the time we've been here today. So I want to know which one is really your memory or did you see this at all?

'''Witness 37''': If none of my stuff is making any sense, like why do y'all keep contacting me?<ref name=CNN.Credibility/>}}

===Dorian Johnson===
Johnson, a friend of Brown, who was with him that day, gave his account of the incident to media outlets in August. In media interviews, Johnson said Wilson pulled up beside them and said, "Get the fuck on the sidewalk."<ref name=CNN.Friend/><ref name=MSNBC.Recounts/><ref name=USAToday.Witness/> The young men replied they were "not but a minute away from [their] destination, and [they] would shortly be out of the street".<ref name=USAToday.Witness/> Wilson drove forward without saying anything further and abruptly backed up, positioning his vehicle crosswise in their path. Wilson tried to open his door aggressively and the door ricocheted off both of their bodies and closed back on Wilson.<ref name=CNN.Shooting/> Wilson, still in his vehicle, grabbed Brown around his neck through the open window, and Brown tried to pull away, but Wilson continued to pull Brown toward him "like tug of war".<ref name=LATimes.Witnesses/><ref name=BostonGlobe.Autopsy/> Johnson said Brown "did not reach for the officer's weapon at all", and was attempting to get free, when Wilson drew his weapon and said, "I'll shoot you" or "I'm going to shoot", and fired his weapon hitting Brown.<ref name=MSNBC.Recounts/><ref name=CNN.Streets/><ref name=RiverfrontTimes.Why/><ref name=Yahoo.Crowd/><ref name=STLToday.Fatal/> Following the initial gunshot, Brown freed himself, and the two fled. Wilson exited the vehicle, and fired several rounds at the fleeing Brown, hitting him once in the back.<ref name=CNN.Shooting/><ref name=USAToday.Witness/> Brown turned around with his hands raised and said, "I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!" Wilson then shot Brown several more times, killing him.<ref name=CNN.Shooting/><ref name=Time.Roots/>

In his testimony in September to the grand jury, Johnson said he and Brown had walked to a convenience store to buy cigarillos, but Brown instead reached over the counter and took them and shoved a clerk on his way out the door.<ref name=IBTimes.Cigarillos/> Johnson testified that on their walk back home, Brown had the cigarillos in his hands in plain sight and two Ferguson police cars passed them, but did not stop.<ref name=IBTimes.Cigarillos/> When Wilson encountered them, he told the two to "get the fuck on the sidewalk" and Johnson told him they would be off the street shortly as they were close to their destination.<ref name=NPR.Friend/> Johnson testified Wilson was the aggressor from the beginning and that for no apparent reason, he backed his vehicle up and tried to open his door, but Brown shut it, preventing him from getting out.<ref name=NPR.Friend/> Johnson said Wilson then reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck and the two were engaged in a "tug of war", and Wilson said "I'll shoot". Johnson said he never saw Brown hit Wilson and did not think Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun, but that a shot was fired.<ref name=NPR.Friend/><ref name=Fox.Witness/> At that point, Johnson said they both ran and Wilson fired while Brown was running away, Brown turned around and "at that time Big Mike's hands was up, but not so much in the air, because he had been struck".<ref name=Fox.Witness/> Johnson told the jurors Brown said "I don't have a gun", was mad and tried to say again "I don't have a gun", but "before he can say the second sentence or before he can even get it out, that's when the several more shots came." In his testimony, Johnson maintained Brown did not run at Wilson prior to the fatal shots.<ref name=Fox.Witness/>

== Early reaction and analysis ==
{{See also|Ferguson unrest}}

=== August 9–14 ===
Peaceful protests and [[civil disorder]] broke out the day following Brown's shooting and lasted for several days. This was in part due to the belief among many that Brown was surrendering, as well as longstanding racial tensions between the minority-black population and the majority-white city government and police.<ref name=WashPost.Even/> As the details of the original shooting event emerged from investigators, police grappled with establishing curfews and maintaining order, while members of the Ferguson community demonstrated in various ways in the vicinity of the original shooting. On {{nowrap|August 10}}, a day of memorials began peacefully, but some crowd members became unruly after an evening candlelight vigil.<ref name=NBC.Looting/> Local police stations assembled approximately 150 officers in riot gear.<ref name=ChiTrib.Protests/> Some people began looting businesses, vandalizing vehicles, and confronting police officers who sought to block off access to several areas of the city.<ref name=NBC.Looting/> Widespread media coverage examined the post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] trend of local police departments arming themselves with military-grade weapons when dealing with protests.<ref name=USAToday.Military/><ref name=WashPost.Military/> In the days following the shooting, state and federal officials weighed in on the matter. On {{nowrap|August 12}}, President [[Barack Obama]] offered his condolences to Brown's family and community.<ref name=KMOV.Obama/> On {{nowrap|August 14}}, Senator [[Rand Paul]] of Kentucky said in an op-ed in ''[[Time Magazine]]'', that the event was a tragedy and that police forces need to be demilitarized.<ref name=Time.Paul/>

=== August 15–30 ===
On {{nowrap|August 15}}, a report and video showing the robbery of a convenience store by Brown was released by the Ferguson Police Department. Brown was accompanied by his friend Dorian Johnson. The report and video were part of a packet that included information about the shooting afterward.<ref name=NPR.Name/><ref name=LATimes.Veteran/><ref name=KSDK.StrongArm/> The report containing frames of the surveillance footage showed Brown grabbing a box of cigarillos, followed by an apparent struggle or confrontation between Brown and a store clerk.<ref name=WashPost.Three/><ref name=WashPost.Suspect/> The statutory deadline in the Sunshine Law, Missouri's equivalent of the federal Freedom of Information Act, was the cited reason for the release following requests by ''{{nowrap|St. Louis}} Post-Dispatch'', [[Judicial Watch]] and others.<ref name=DevinJames.Karr/><ref name=STLToday.Mislead/><ref name=KPLR.Timeline/>

The Department of Justice had urged the video not be released, saying a release would inflame tension.<ref name=NBC.Feds/> Missouri Governor [[Jay Nixon]] identified the release as an attempt to disparage Brown during the investigation that would inflame the community.<ref name=Guardian.Points/><ref name=IJR.Nixon/> Brown's family released a statement in which they condemn the way the police chief chose to disseminate information, calling it [[character assassination]] following the "[[execution-style murder]]" of their son.<ref name=NYTimes.Emotions/>

The {{nowrap|August 15}} release of information was criticized as part of an erratic and infrequent release of information by the police.<ref name=Fox.Cedes/> Previously, the police withheld the name of the officer involved in the shooting, citing safety concerns following death threats against the unnamed officer.<ref name=NPR.Name/>  The {{nowrap|St Louis}} County Police incident report lacked details.<ref name=Time.Report/> The Ferguson Police incident report was obtained by the ACLU after a request and subsequent lawsuit.<ref name=ACLU.Report/> Wilson did not file an incident report<ref name=Time.Report /> and there was no Ferguson Police use-of-force report related to the incident.<ref name=Yahoo.Report/> The Ferguson Police Department refused to commit to a deadline for releasing a full autopsy report.<ref name=Time.Roots/>

When the report and video were released, the police said Wilson had known Brown was a suspect in the robbery.<ref name=NYDailyNews.Bombshell/> In a media conference, Ferguson's chief of police [[Thomas Jackson (police officer)|Tom Jackson]] said the robbery was unrelated to the initial contact, and had nothing to do with Wilson stopping Brown and Johnson.<ref name=NPR.Name/><ref name=NYDailyNews.Bombshell/> Jackson later clarified Wilson recognized Brown as a suspect because he saw a box of cigars in his hand.<ref name=USAToday.Cigars/><ref name=STLToday.Jesse/> Eugene O'Donnell, a former district attorney in New York City who now serves as a professor at the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]], said, while the police officer may have stopped Brown for jaywalking, Brown may have been thinking the officer knew about the robbery: "Obviously the cop's reaction is not affected, but what could be affected is [Brown's] reaction to the cop."<ref name=LATimes.Matters/>

A Pew Research Center Survey published on August 18 suggested differences in American public opinion between whites and blacks. It indicated 80% of blacks and 37% of whites believed the shooting "raises important issues about race".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/|title=Stark Racial Divisions in Reactions to Ferguson Police Shooting|date=August 18, 2014|website=Pew Research Center|access-date=February 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085443/http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/|archive-date=August 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

On {{nowrap|October 22}}, anonymous sources leaked to the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|{{nowrap|St. Louis}} Post-Dispatch]]'' what they described as Wilson's grand jury testimony.<ref name=NYMag.Justice/> The Justice Department issued a statement that it "considers the selective release of information in this investigation to be irresponsible and highly troubling.

Following the grand jury announcement, protests, some of them violent, broke out in Ferguson and other cities across the United States. Several Ferguson businesses were looted and fires set by protesters. Protests erupted in 170 cities across the U.S., including<ref name=Economist.Belong/> [[St Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Seattle]], [[Albuquerque]], [[New York City]], [[Cleveland]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Oakland]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], and [[Boston]].<ref name=BBC.Protests/> Numerous media reports and legal experts criticized the process for failing to return an indictment in cases concerning law enforcement officers.<ref name=CSM.Rarely/><ref name=538.Rare/>

A December 2014 opinion poll by Washington Post-ABC News showed a majority of blacks do not believe that they receive treatment equal to whites by the police or the criminal justice system. Six out of ten white Americans believe the police treat races equally with roughly half of white Americans believing the criminal justice provides equal treatment, but there is a sharp partisan divide between white Americans. [[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] white Americans are far more likely to say whites and blacks receive equal treatment in the justice system than the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] white Americans.<ref name=WashPost.Partisan/>{{refn|group=note|The poll was conducted {{nowrap|December 11–15}}, 2014, with a random national sample of 1,012 adults with an overall margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, but an error margin of 11 points for results among African Americans and Hispanics.<ref name=WashPost.Partisan/>}}

=== March 2015 ===
On {{nowrap|March 4}}, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Wilson would not be charged in the shooting.  Its report said "[t]here is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety," and that accounts that Brown put his hands up are "inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence".<ref name=ABC.NotCharge/>

President Obama reacted to the announcement, stating, "The finding that was made [by the Department of Justice] was that it was not unreasonable to determine that there was not sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson. That was an objective, thorough, independent federal investigation." He further added, "We may never know exactly what happened. But Officer Wilson like anybody else who is charged with a crime benefits from due process and a reasonable doubt standard."<ref name=ABC.Obama/>

Various heads of state and foreign news organizations have commented on the shooting and subsequent protests including the Chinese [[Xinhua News Agency]], Germany's ''[[Der Spiegel]]'',<ref name=LATimes.International/> Egypt's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Egypt)|Ministry of Foreign affairs]],<ref name=DNEgypt.Restraint/> the Iranian [[Islamic Republic News Agency]],<ref name=LATimes.International/> protesters throughout the Middle East,<ref name=NYTimes.Advice/> the Russian Foreign Ministry,<ref name=LATimes.International/> Spain's ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'',<ref name=WashPost.World/> the British ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'',<ref name=MetroUK.Dehumanise/> and others.<ref name=LATimes.International/>

== Reactions to grand jury decision ==
[[File:NYC Mike Brown-Ferguson protest Union Square 11.JPG|thumb|Protesters react the day following the grand jury decision in [[Union Square, Manhattan]] in [[New York City]].]]
The grand jury process was atypical because of significant and numerous departures from other normal grand jury proceedings. The American grand jury process operates in secret, with the proceedings, evidence and testimony rarely being released to the public in cases of no indictment. From the beginning, McCulloch desired to provide transparency to the process and had the proceeding transcribed with the intention of releasing the materials to the public if there was no indictment. [[Paul G. Cassell|Paul Cassell]], former U.S. federal judge, said the investigative grand jury was unique because they were investigating with no assurance that any criminal conduct was present, in contrast to normal grand jury proceedings which have been screened for probable cause by a prosecutor. McCulloch's intentions to present all the evidence resulted in the proceedings which took far longer than regular grand juries which decide within days.<ref name=WashPost.Fair/>

Earlier in the hearing, the prosecution presented a 1979 Missouri statute allowing officers to use deadly force "to effect the arrest or prevent the escape from custody [of a person]". Before the grand jury deliberated, jurors were told to disregard the previous instructions and use case law from the [[Tennessee v Garner]] ruling, which said it was unconstitutional for police officers to use deadly force to apprehend non-dangerous fleeing suspects.<ref name=KWMU.Wrangled/> Missouri Attorney General [[Chris Koster]], acknowledged the grand jury was given information based on the state law before being informed that deadly force cannot be used merely to prevent the escape of an unarmed suspect.<ref name=KWMU.Wrangled /><ref name=RawStory.Misled/> ''[[MSNBC]]'s'' [[Lawrence O'Donnell]] argued that this change amounted to a deliberate attempt by the prosecution to make it impossible to indict Wilson.<ref name=Donnell.Last>{{cite AV media | title=The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell – "Rewrite" segment | publisher=MSNBC | date=November 26, 2014 | medium=Television}}</ref> Andrew F. Branca, a Massachusetts lawyer focusing on self-defense law, attributed O'Donnell's comments as a [[straw man]] because self-defense is a completely independent and sufficient justification for the use of deadly force.<ref name=LegalInsurrection.Decision/> The {{nowrap|St. Louis}} Public Radio later clarified that even if Wilson was indicted and convicted at trial based on the Garner ruling, the conviction could be challenged on the basis that Missouri law permitted the use of deadly force.<ref name=KWMU.Wrangled />

The prosecution's handling of the case received particular attention. Roger Parloff said prosecutors do not usually exclude truly exculpatory evidence and that prosecutors do not typically indict if they believe the accused is not guilty, disagreeing with the notion that McCulloch should have presented evidence with the purpose of obtaining an indictment.<ref name=Fortune.Deaths/> Jay Sterling Silver said the grand jury case indicated a conflict of interest between local prosecutors and police, as the former needs to maintain a good relationship with law enforcement.<ref name=TimesDispatch.Silver /> [[Mark O'Mara]] said the unusual process was to avoid arguments that the presentation was to effect a particular result, yet despite this McCulloch was still criticized for the decision. Paul Callan, former deputy chief of homicide in the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, gave a layered response which asserted the choice to present all the evidence was unusual, but not unprecedented in controversial cases. Callan said some prosecutors use the grand jury process as political cover in cases which would not succeed at trial, and in cases in which subsequent investigations and civil lawsuits would raise further criticism.<ref name=CNN.Credibility/> William Fitzpatrick, of the National District Attorneys Association, said it was not strange for prosecutors in police-involved cases to provide all available evidence and not ask for a specific charge and defended McCulloch's inclusion of evidence.<ref name=LATimes.Strategy/> [[Jeffrey Toobin]] agreed the exoneration may have been well-justified because a conviction would have been very unlikely at a trial, but the process that was used does not inspire confidence in the legal system.<ref name=CNN.Credibility/> In a later interview, McCulloch defended the choice to include all evidence and not skew the presentation just for the sake of getting an indictment.<ref name=KTRS.McGraw/>

''The New York Times'' described prosecutors' questioning of Wilson as "gentle" and said it contrasted with the sharp challenges to witnesses whose accounts seemed to contradict Wilson's, and reported this had led some to question whether the process was as objective as McCulloch had claimed. The ''Times'' reported prosecutors asked witness after witness if Brown appeared to be reaching for a weapon when confronting Wilson, though few of them said this. Furthermore, contradictions in testimony by Wilson and other law-enforcement officers were left unchallenged by prosecutors.<ref name=NYTimes.Trusting/> CNN legal analyst [[Sunny Hostin]] criticized the prosecutors for asking softball questions during the cross examination of Wilson's testimony, and referred particularly to the fact that no witness could corroborate Wilson's story that he had warned Brown twice to lie down on the ground, and when asked, witnesses said they did not hear him say that.<ref name=RawStory.Fanciful/>

After the grand jury's decision was announced, Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, turned to a crowd of demonstrators who had gathered, and yelled "Burn this bitch down", according to a ''New York Times'' video.<ref name=CNN.Stepfather/> Moments before, he had said "If I get up [on the platform] I'm gonna start a riot."<ref name=AlJazeera.Stepdad/> He later apologized for the outburst.<ref name=CNN.Sorry/>
