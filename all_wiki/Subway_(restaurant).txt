Features include self-order kiosks; USB charging ports at tables; and new menu items, including additional condiments, and bread [[Gluten free diet|made without gluten]]. The company is piloting the changes at 12 locations across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with many features expected to be implemented into stores worldwide by the end of 2017.<ref name="Fresh Forward">{{cite web|url=http://www.multivu.com/players/English/8139451-subway-new-fresh-forward-restaurant-design/|title=Subway Brings "Fresh Forward" With New Restaurant Design, Customer Experience|work=Multivu|date=July 17, 2017|access-date=July 17, 2017}}</ref>

In 2017, the chain closed more than 800 of its U.S. locations. In April 2018, the chain announced it would close about 500 more that year. According to Abha Bhattarai of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', this is a result of three consecutive years of falling profits, and foot traffic in Subway stores reduced by 25 percent since 2012. Franchisees also complained that the company's deep promotions further ate away at profits. Industry analysts like Bob Phibbs, chief executive of the New York-based consulting firm Retail Doctor, say changing tastes on the part of consumers, who more frequently prefer locally sourced produce and hormone-free meat served by regional start-ups like [[Sweetgreen]], especially in metropolitan areas, are the cause of the drop in Subway's sales, as well as the loss of market share to competitors. These include fast-casual eateries and sandwich shops like [[Panera Bread]], [[Au Bon Pain]] and [[Firehouse Subs]], as well as food trucks, and grocery stores that offer freshly made meals at competitive prices. In January 2018, Subway invested $25 million in a re-branding campaign targeted at young consumers in order to revitalize its image and boost sales.<ref name=WashingtonPost/>

These are [[Build to order|made to order]] (like the subs) and heated for 85 seconds. Breakfast and pizza items are only available in some stores.

===Regional variations===
Subway's menu varies between countries, most significantly where there are religious requirements relating to the meats served.

In 2006, the first [[kosher Subway]] restaurant in the United States opened, in a suburb of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in the Mandel JCC of Cleveland. Former Subway spokesman [[Jared Fogle]] attended the opening. A press release stated, "With slight modifications, such as no pork-based products, and the use of [[Soy cheese|soy-based cheese]] product, the menu is virtually identical to that of any other Subway restaurant."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/13250 |title=First Kosher Subway Restaurant Opens in Cleveland |publisher=Pr.com |date=June 6, 2006 |access-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref> Other openings soon followed, briefly making Subway one of the largest U.S. kosher restaurant chains.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fishkoff |first=Sue |url=http://www.jta.org/2009/08/05/life-religion/eat-fresh-eat-kosher-subway-the-largest-u-s-kosher-restaurant-chain |title=Eat fresh, eat kosher: Subway the largest U.S. kosher restaurant chain |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=August 5, 2009 |access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref> At their peak, twelve kosher Subway locations were open in the U.S, including Kansas City and 5 in New York.

Subway opened its first restaurant in India in 2001 in [[New Delhi]]. In deference to [[Hindu]] beliefs, Subway restaurants in India do not serve beef products; on the other hand, the country's large number of vegetarians has induced Subway's Indian outlets to offer a much extended range of vegetarian options. As of January 2017 there were 591 Subway restaurants in 68 Indian cities.<ref name="Subway ExploreOurWorld" /> On September 4, 2012, Subway opened its first all-vegetarian outlet on the campus of [[Lovely Professional University]] (LPU) in [[Jalandhar]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Rohan Dua |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Subway-to-roll-out-worlds-1st-all-veg-outlet-in-Punjab/articleshow/15526098.cms |title=Subway to roll out world's 1st all-veg outlet in Punjab |work=Times Of India|date=August 17, 2012 |access-date=December 19, 2017}}</ref> On March 6, 2013, Subway opened its second all-vegetarian outlet also offering Jain food in [[Paldi]], [[Ahmedabad]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Chitra Unnithan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/US-food-giants-turn-vegetarian-in-Gujarat/articleshow/18823980.cms |title=US food giants turn vegetarian in Gujarat |newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=March 6, 2013 |access-date=December 19, 2017 }}</ref>

Subway is the second-biggest [[fast food advertising|fast food advertiser]] in the United States, behind only McDonald's. It spent US$516,000,000 on measurable advertising in 2011.<ref>[http://adage.com/article/news/meet-america-s-25-biggest-advertisers/242969/?qwr=FullSite Meet America's 25 biggest advertisers].

Subway used the advertising slogan "Eat Fresh", and focused on how its sandwiches were made from freshly baked bread and fresh ingredients, in front of customers to their exact specifications, by employees which Subway called "Subway Sandwich Artists".{{cn|date=August 2020}}

In 2005, Subway scrapped its "Sub Club" stamp promotion, citing a growing number of counterfeit stamps due to online auction sites and the increasing availability of high-quality printers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fraud stamps out Subway sandwich promo|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8075754/ns/business-us_business/t/fraud-stamps-out-subway-sandwich-promo/|access-date=29 November 2017|work=msnbc.com|date=3 June 2005|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Subway Scraps Free-Sandwich Promotion|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/02/subway-scraps-free-sandwich-promotion.html|access-date=29 November 2017|work=Fox News|date=2 June 2005}}</ref>

Subway ran a [[product placement]] campaign in the US TV series ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' since its first season. As ratings dwindled in the second season, a campaign to "save Chuck" was launched for fans, encouraging them to purchase a footlong sub from Subway on April 27, 2009, the date of the season finale. Tony Pace, Subway's marketing officer, called it the best product placement the restaurant chain has done "in several years."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvweek.com/tvmojoe/2009/04/subway-good-night-and-good-chu.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430093858/http://www.tvweek.com/tvmojoe/2009/04/subway-good-night-and-good-chu.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 30, 2009 |title=Subway: Good Night, and Good 'Chuck' |publisher=TV Week |date=April 27, 2009 |access-date=April 27, 2009}}</ref>

[[Jared Fogle]] was a national spokesman for the company in the US starting in January 2000, giving talks on healthy living and appearing in advertisements. Fogle first came to attention in his native [[Indiana]] by claiming that he lost over 200 pounds in part by eating at Subway. From 2008, he was featured less often as the company marketed with more emphasis on its "5 dollar footlong" campaign.<ref name="Yahoo!">{{cite web |first=Matthew|last=Boyle|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/career-work/article/108119/the-ac |title=The Accidental Hero |website=[[Yahoo!

In December 2015, following the removal of Fogle from its marketing, Subway introduced a new marketing campaign, "Founded on Fresh". The campaign focuses on Subway's establishment and early history, and features [[Fred DeLuca]], as played by his son, Jonathan. The new campaign downplays the use of jingles and celebrity endorsements (besides "targeted" sports marketing), in favor of focusing upon the qualities of its products, and specific products. Chief advertising officer Chris Carroll explained that the focus on fat, calories, and weight loss were "what fresh used to be", and that the new campaign would focus more on the sourcing of Subway's ingredients, such as its phase-out of [[Antibiotic use in livestock|antibiotic-treated meat]]. Carroll also explained that the new strategy was being developed prior to the controversy involving Fogle.<ref name="adage-foundedonfresh">{{cite magazine|first=E.J.|last=Schultz|title=Behind Subway's Post-Jared Strategy: No More Discount Ads, Fewer Celebs |url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/subway-s-strategy-discount-ads/301938/ |magazine=[[Advertising Age]] |publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|location=New York City|date=December 27, 2015|access-date=February 8, 2016}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

===$5 footlongs===
In 2008, Subway began to offer all foot-long submarine sandwiches (excluding the premium and double-meat varieties) for five dollars, in the continental United States and Canada, as a "limited time only" promotion. "Five Dollar Footlongs" quickly became the company's most successful promotion ever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2010/05/19/Subway-Sues-Over-Footlong.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522174756/http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2010/05/19/Subway-Sues-Over-Footlong.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 22, 2010 |title=Did Subway Put Its Foot(long) In Its Mouth? |publisher=Brandchannel.com |access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref> Upon the initial promotion's completion, customer response prompted Subway to create a permanent "$5 Footlong Everyday Value Menu" that offered some footlong sandwiches for $5. Since 2011, there has been a monthly rotating $5 footlong.<ref name="Yahoo!"/> In October 2011, a similar promotion was launched in the United Kingdom. Customers can buy one of nine subs and any drink for £3 (for a six-inch sub) or £5 (for a footlong).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subway.co.uk/menu/subs/value-lunch/default.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015075818/http://www.subway.co.uk/menu/subs/value-lunch/default.aspx |archive-date=2011-10-15 |title=The £3 lunch |work=Subway |access-date=October 26, 2012}}</ref>

===Sandwich size===
On February 2, 2007, [[KNXV|KNXV-TV]] (with the help of the Arizona Department of Weights and Measures) reported that three of Subway's "Giant Sub" sandwiches, nominally each {{convert|3|ft|cm|adj=on}} long, were actually {{convert|2|ft|8|in|cm}}, {{convert|2|ft|8.25|in|cm}}, and {{convert|2|ft|8.5|in|cm}} long. The maximum variance in length allowed in Arizona is 3% ({{convert|1.08|in|cm}}, for a three-foot sub). The report also showed the boxes designed to store these sandwiches were {{convert|2|ft|10.75|in|cm}} in length; shorter than the maximum allowable variance. In response to the report, Subway said it was reevaluating its advertising, training and packaging materials with regard to the specific or implied length of Giant Subs, and was advising its franchisees to only discuss with customers the approximate number of expected servings and not a specific length of measurement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc15.com/content/news/investigators/story.aspx?content_id=cf4c217c-1910-4040-9a33-0102fdd135c7 |title=Sub-Standard |author=Joe Ducey |publisher=[[KNXV-TV]] ([[Phoenix, Arizona]]) |date=June 26, 2007 |access-date=April 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818130828/http://www.abc15.com/content/news/investigators/story.aspx?content_id=cf4c217c-1910-4040-9a33-0102fdd135c7 |archive-date=August 18, 2007}}  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820190407/http://consumerist.com/consumer/videos/subways-3-foot-subs-are-shorter-than-3-feet-276511.php Video]</ref>

In January 2013, an Australian teen, Matt Corby, complained on [[Facebook]] that Subway's "footlong" sandwich was only {{convert|11|in|cm}} long, rather than {{convert|1|foot|cm}}. Subway responded by saying, "With regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, 'Subway Footlong' is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in Subway Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of length."<ref>{{cite news |title=Subway explains shortness of their 'Footlong' sandwiches: It's just the name of the sub |url=https://nypost.com/2013/01/19/subway-explains-shortness-of-their-footlong-sandwiches-its-just-the-name-of-the-sub/ |newspaper=New York Post |access-date=January 19, 2013 |first=Dan |last=Mangan |date=January 19, 2013}}</ref> [[Discovery (law)|Discovery]] during a subsequent class-action lawsuit revealed that most Subway sandwiches were the advertised length.

===Franchise relations===
In 1995, Subway Sandwich Shops, Fred DeLuca, Peter Buck, and Doctor's Associates Inc. were held liable for breach of contract. An Illinois jury awarded more than $10 million in damages to Nicholas and Victoria Jannotta after finding lease and contract violations. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants had misrepresented the asset value of Subway Sandwich Shops (a leasing company used by Doctor's Associates for franchising purposes) while negotiating a 1985 lease agreement.<ref name="NationsRestaurantNews">{{cite news |title=Subway ordered to pay $10M in punitive damages to ex-landlord |author=Robin Lee Allen |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n49_v29/ai_17847096/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106155226/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n49_v29/ai_17847096/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 6, 2012 |date=December 11, 1995 |access-date=August 8, 2011 |work=Nation's Restaurant News}}</ref>

The U.S. House of Representatives' small business committee studied the franchise industry from 1992 to 1998. Dean Sagar noted, "Subway is the biggest problem in franchising and emerges as one of the key examples of every abuse you can think of."<ref name="FortuneMagazine">{{cite news |title=Why Subway Is 'The Biggest Problem In Franchising' That's the assessment of a congressional staffer who studied |author=Richard Behar |url=http://nextraterrestrial.com/pdf/FDeluca-Fortune%20March%2016%201998.htm |work=Forbes Magazine |date=March 16, 1998 |access-date=August 8, 2011}}</ref> In 1989, the U.S. Small Business Administration refused small business loans to Subway franchise owners until Subway removed a contract clause which gave it the power to seize and purchase any franchise without cause.

===United Kingdom VAT treatment===
In October 2010, Subway franchisees in the United Kingdom lost a high court appeal, against paying standard [[Value-added tax|VAT]] on all toasted subs, as required by [[HM Revenue and Customs]]. Thus, in the United Kingdom, a toasted sub attracts VAT, whereas a cold sub, eaten off the premises, does not. Competitors such as [[Quiznos]] and [[McDonald's]] do not pay VAT on similar food.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.examiner.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/subway-wrangle-over-vat-could-4982720 |title=Subway wrangle over VAT could be heading to high court |work=Huddersfield Daily Examiner |date=January 4, 2011 |access-date=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taxation.co.uk/taxation/node/21166 |title=Big butties, small mindedness |publisher=Taxation |date=October 20, 2010 |access-date=February 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026072443/http://www.taxation.co.uk/taxation/node/21166 |archive-date=October 26, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://howladerandco.com/subway-vat-appeal-subway-loses/337/ |title=Subway VAT appeal: Subway loses |publisher=Howlader & Co |date=November 4, 2010 |access-date=January 17, 2011}}</ref>

In March 2012, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]] announced plans to close the loophole that allows Subway competitors to offer hot food without paying VAT. This legislation was expected to come into force from October 2012 onward,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17468868 |work=BBC News |title=Budget 2012: VAT move could 'hit cost of bacon rolls' |date=March 21, 2012}}</ref> but the government withdrew plans to charge VAT on originally hot food being allowed to cool naturally on May 28, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18244640 |work=BBC News |title=Government does U-turn over 'Cornish pasty tax' |date=May 28, 2012}}</ref> In June 2012, Subway launched the "Toast the Tax" campaign to put pressure on [[Government of the United Kingdom|the government]] to drop VAT on toasted sandwiches, as it has done for hot savouries.<ref>{{cite web |last=Shaw |first=Martin |url=https://www.examiner.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/david-cameron-birkby-v-david-4950101 |title=David Cameron of Birkby v David Cameron of Downing Street in toastie tax row |work=Huddersfield Examiner |date=June 24, 2012 |access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref>

===Footlong trademark disputes===
On January 31, 2011, Subway lawyer Valerie Pochron, wrote to [[Casey's General Stores]], a chain of Iowa-based convenience stores, demanding the small chain to cease using the term "footlong" in advertisements for its 12-inch sandwiches. Subway threatened to sue. Consequently, in February 2011, Casey's General Stores Inc. filed a petition in a U.S. District Court in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], seeking a legal declaration that the word "footlong" does not violate Subway's rights.<ref name="caseys">{{cite news |url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-02-14-subway-caseys-footlong-suit_N.htm |title=Casey's sues Subway over rights to 'footlong' |work=USA Today |date=July 16, 2010 |access-date=February 17, 2011}}</ref> Casey's further sought a declaration that the word "footlong" is a generic description of a sandwich measuring one foot.<ref>{{cite web |last=Welte |first=Melanie S. |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41584626 |title=Iowa store chain sues Subway over 'footlong' |publisher=NBC News |date=February 14, 2011 |access-date=February 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.iasd.43593 |title=Complaint, Casey's v.

Subway's trademark application for "footlong" has yet to be approved by the federal government. Subway has attempted to register it with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] twice. It filed on November 8, 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77324328&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch |title=U. S.

[[Yum Brands]] (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and non-Canadian A&W locations), Long John Silver's and other competitors opposed the applications.<ref name="caseys"/>

===Ingredients===
Subway made alterations to its bread after food blogger and activist [[Vani Hari]] gathered more than 50,000 signatures in a [[petition]] drive. Subway removed [[azodicarbonamide]] from its bread.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.subway.com/subwayroot/about_us/PR_Docs/QualityBread.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140226214846/http://www.subway.com/subwayroot/about_us/PR_Docs/QualityBread.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = February 26, 2014 |title=Our Commitment to Our Customers: Serving Quality Products Subway Introduces Azo Free Bread in the US and Canada |publisher=subway.com}}</ref> Before Vani Hari's petition, Subway had used azodicarbonamide as a bread conditioner, to whiten the dough and allow [[sandwich bread]] to bake more quickly.  {{as of|2016}}, the ingredient was still used by other fast food restaurants.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/chemical-subway-ditched-mcdonalds-wendys-use-it-too-n25051 |title=That Chemical Subway Ditched?

In August 2015, Vani Hari again petitioned Subway in conjunction with [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[Friends of the Earth (US)|Friends of the Earth]], the [[Center for Food Safety]], [[Public Interest Research Group|U.S. Public Interest Research Group]] to commit to buying meat produced without the routine use of [[antibiotics]] and to provide a timeline for doing so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/281c67ec64564506b17f8f59c8083395/subway-transition-meat-raised-without-antibiotics|title=Subway to transition to meat raised without antibiotics|website=The Big Story|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023210006/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/281c67ec64564506b17f8f59c8083395/subway-transition-meat-raised-without-antibiotics|archive-date=23 October 2015|access-date=April 20, 2016}}</ref> In October 2015, Subway announced it would transition to chicken raised without antibiotics in 2016 and turkey within the following 2–3 years, and would also transition beef and pork raised without antibiotics by 2025.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/10/20/450314991/subway-joins-the-fast-food-antibiotic-free-meat-club |title=Subway Joins The Fast-Food, Antibiotic-Free Meat Club |website=NPR.org|access-date=April 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.subway.com/subwayroot/about_us/PR_Docs/AntibioticFreeRelease10.20.15.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423013158/https://www.subway.com/subwayroot/about_us/PR_Docs/AntibioticFreeRelease10.20.15.pdf |archive-date=April 23, 2016 |url-status=dead |title=SUBWAY Restaurants Elevates Current Antibiotic-Free Policy U.S. Restaurants Will Only Serve Animal Proteins That Have Never Been Treated With Antibiotics |website=Subway.com }}</ref>

In 2020 the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] ruled that Subway bread had too high a sugar content to be classed as bread for VAT reasons, with its recipe including  sugar equal to 10% of the weight of the flour.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sandwiches in Subway 'too sugary to meet legal definition of being bread' |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/sandwiches-in-subway-too-sugary-to-meet-legal-definition-of-being-bread-39574778.html |access-date=1 October 2020 |work=independent |language=en}}</ref>

===Soy protein in chicken products===
In an investigation by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)]]'s consumer affairs television series ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]'' aired in February 2017, chicken from five fast-food restaurants were lab-tested to determine constituents. While DNA testing found between 84.9% and 89.4% of the DNA from other restaurants' chicken products to be chicken DNA, with the remaining being unidentifiable plant DNA, on the two Subway chicken items tested, 53.6% and 42.8% of the DNA were found to be chicken, with the remainder being mostly soy. Although ingredients listings did show soy protein to be a constituent of both of the chicken products, Subway states that the proportion is less than or equal to 1% and that the finding of about 50% soy DNA is not representative of the actual amount of soy in the product. Subway has called CBC's report "absolutely false and misleading" and demanded that it be retracted, a demand the CBC had not acceded to {{as of|lc=y|2017|July}}. Meanwhile, however, Subway Canada stated that it was investigating with its supplier to ensure that the proportion of soy protein was as per expectations.<ref>{{cite news |title=The chicken challenge: Testing your fast food - Marketplace - CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/episodes/2015-2016/chicken |website=cbc.ca |date=February 24, 2017 |access-date=March 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fast food chicken: Testing Subway, McDonald's, A&W, Wendy's & Tim Hortons (CBC Marketplace) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd3Trr8Xrdc |website=[[YouTube]] |date=February 24, 2017 |access-date=March 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=What's in your chicken sandwich?

According to Subway's website, ingredients in U.S. stores may differ from ingredients in Canadian stores. Both countries include soy protein in chicken strips, but only the U.S. version states that it is present in quantities of 2% or less. The Canadian version includes soy as an ingredient in its chicken patty, but the United States version does not.<ref>{{cite news |title=Subway Denies That Its Chicken Is 50% Filler |url=http://time.com/4686280/subway-chicken-fast-food-filler/ |access-date=May 14, 2017 |work=Time |date=March 5, 2017}}</ref>

In April 2017, Subway sued the CBC, as well as the reporter and two producers, for $210 million, alleging the CBC acted "recklessly and maliciously", and that "these false statements... were published and republished, maliciously and without just cause or excuse, to a global audience, which has resulted in pecuniary loss to the plaintiffs." The CBC stood by its reports, stating that the DNA tests were done by independent and credible experts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Subway files defamation suit against CBC over chicken reports |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cbc-subway-chicken-lawsuit-1.4074401 |access-date=May 14, 2017 |work=CBC News |date=April 18, 2017 |language=en}}</ref> The CBC's Emma Bédard stated that Subway has not provided any alternative explanation for the DNA test results obtained by the CBC.<ref name="torstar-cbcsuit">{{cite web |title=Subway says it plans to sue CBC for $210 million over chicken findings |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/03/16/subway-says-it-plans-to-sue-cbc-for-210-million-over-chicken-findings.html |website=Toronto Star |date=March 16, 2017 |access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref>

===Underpaying workers===
In 2019, the Fair Work Ombudsman found that 17 Australian-based Subway franchises had underpaid workers.<ref name="ABCunderpay">{{cite news |last1=Ryan |first1=Peter |title=Subway forced to cough up workers' unpaid wages in crackdown on fast-food sector |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-01/subway-employees-recover-unpaid-wages/11563342 |access-date=26 December 2019 |agency=ABC News |date=1 October 2019}}</ref> The lengthy investigation by the Ombudsman specifically found that franchises failed to pay the employees minimum wages, casual loadings, holiday and overtime rates, and did not issue proper pay slips or keep proper employment records.<ref name=ABCunderpay/> The investigation resulted in over $81,000 being recovered in unpaid wages for over 160 employees.<ref name=ABCunderpay/> Subway responded by introducing a rolling audit of franchisee employment records and commented that franchise agreements could be terminated if franchisees failed to meet Australian workplace laws and Subway's internal standards of operation.<ref name=ABCunderpay/>
