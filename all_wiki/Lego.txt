The company's flagship product, Lego, consists of variously coloured [[Interchangeable parts|interlocking]] plastic bricks accompanying an array of gears, figurines called [[Lego minifigure|minifigure]]s, and various other parts. Lego pieces can be assembled and connected in many ways to construct objects, including vehicles, buildings, and working robots. Anything constructed can be taken apart again, and the pieces reused to make new things.<ref name="Lego History-About Us">{{cite web|title=Lego History-About Us|url=http://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/lego-group/the_lego_history|website=Lego|accessdate=6 September 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905173143/http://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/lego-group/the_lego_history|archivedate=5 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How a Lego Works|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/lego.htm&ved=0CDgQFjAJahUKEwiu2PPDsOPHAhXFthoKHf_OBxA&usg=AFQjCNGx38bu4F1dnuEFjSeWcq0LCXXrew|website=How Stuff Works|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref>

The Lego Group began manufacturing the interlocking toy bricks in 1949. Movies, games, competitions and eight [[Legoland]] [[amusement park]]s have been developed under the brand. As of July 2015, 600&nbsp;billion Lego parts had been produced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lego Fun Facts|url=http://www.brickrecycler.com/lego-fun-facts/|website=Brick Recycler|accessdate=6 September 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126042502/http://www.brickrecycler.com/lego-fun-facts/|archivedate=26 November 2015}}</ref>

In February 2015, Lego replaced [[Ferrari]] as [[Brand Finance]]'s "world's most powerful brand".<ref name="Brand Finance" /> At certain points, investing in Lego sets was more valuable than investing in gold.<ref>{{cite web |title=Report claims LEGOs are better investment than gold |url=https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/report-claims-legos-are-better-investment-than-gold |website=fox10phoenix.com |publisher=FOX 10 Phoenix |accessdate=23 January 2019}}</ref>

The Lego Group began in the workshop of [[Ole Kirk Christiansen]] (1891–1958), a carpenter from [[Billund, Denmark|Billund]], Denmark, who began making wooden toys in 1932.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Wiencek|1987|p=16}}</ref><ref name="LEGObook">{{harvnb|Lipkowitz|2012}}</ref> In 1934, his company came to be called "Lego", derived from the [[Danish language|Danish]] phrase {{lang|da|leg godt}} {{IPA-da|lɑjˀ ˈkʌt|}}, which means "play well".<ref name="lego-group-history">{{cite web |title=The Lego Group History |url=https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/lego-group/the-lego-group-history/ |website=lego.com |accessdate=13 May 2020}}</ref> In 1947, Lego expanded to begin producing plastic toys.<ref name="Wiencek45-46">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Wiencek|1987|pp=45–46}}</ref> In 1949 Lego began producing, among other new products, an early version of the now familiar interlocking bricks, calling them "Automatic Binding Bricks". These bricks were based on the [[Kiddicraft]] Self-Locking Bricks, which had been patented in the United Kingdom in 1939<ref>{{cite web|url=http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=GB&NR=529580&KC=&FT=E|title=Improvements in toy building blocks, patent GB529580 of 25 November 1940 by Harry Fisher Page of Kiddicraft|publisher=espacenet.com|date=17 July 2010|accessdate=17 July 2010}}</ref> and released in 1947.

The Lego Group's motto, "only the best is good enough"<ref>{{Cite web|title=How we keep your data safe - Customer Service - LEGO.com MY|url=https://www.lego.com/en-my/service/data/|access-date=2020-09-25|website=www.lego.com}}</ref> ({{Lang-da|det bedste er ikke for godt}}, literally "the best isn't excessively good") was created in 1936.<ref name="LEGObook" /> This motto, which is still used today, was created by Christiansen to encourage his employees never to skimp on quality, a value he believed in strongly.<ref name="LEGObook" /> By 1951 plastic toys accounted for half of the Lego company's output, even though the Danish trade magazine ''Legetøjs-Tidende'' ("Toy Times"), visiting the Lego factory in Billund in the early 1950s, felt that plastic would never be able to replace traditional wooden toys.<ref name="Wiencek46-52">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Wiencek|1987|pp=46–52}}</ref> Although a common sentiment, Lego toys seem to have become a significant exception to the dislike of plastic in children's toys, due in part to the high standards set by Ole Kirk.<ref>Lauwaert, M.

By 1954, Christiansen's son, [[Godtfred Kirk Christiansen|Godtfred]], had become the junior managing director of the Lego Group.<ref name="Wiencek46-52" /> It was his conversation with an overseas buyer that led to the idea of a toy system. Godtfred saw the immense potential in Lego bricks to become a system for creative play, but the bricks still had some problems from a technical standpoint: their locking ability was limited and they were not versatile.<ref name="Lego History-About Us" /> In 1958, the modern brick design was developed; it took five years to find the right material for it, ABS ([[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]]) polymer.<ref name="Wiencek68-72" /><ref name="Pickering15" /> The modern Lego brick design was patented on 28 January 1958.<ref name="Time50Years">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1707379,00.html|title=Lego Celebrates 50 Years of Building|work=[[TIME]]|date=28 January 2008|accessdate=28 January 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131130615/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1707379,00.html|archivedate=31 January 2008}}</ref>

Lego pieces of all varieties constitute a universal system.

Primary concept and development work takes place at the Billund headquarters, where the company employs approximately 120 designers. The company also has smaller design offices in the UK, Spain, Germany, and Japan which are tasked with developing products aimed specifically at these markets. The average development period for a new product is around twelve months, split into three stages. The first stage is to identify market trends and developments, including contact by the designers directly with the market; some are stationed in toy shops close to holidays, while others interview children. The second stage is the design and development of the product based upon the results of the first stage. As of September 2008 the design teams use [[3D modelling]] software to generate [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawings from initial design sketches. The designs are then prototyped using an in-house [[stereolithography]] machine. These prototypes are presented to the entire project team for comment and for testing by parents and children during the "validation" process. Designs may then be altered in accordance with the results from the [[focus groups]]. [[Virtual model]]s of completed Lego products are built concurrently with the writing of the user instructions. Completed CAD models are also used in the wider organisation, for marketing and packaging.<ref name="3d">{{Cite journal|title=Child's Play|author=Frances Corbet|journal=Develop 3D|publisher=X3DMedia|pages=25–27|date=September 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Arburg Lego.png|thumb|right|Lego injection moulding machines, made by the German company [[Arburg]]]]
Since 1963, Lego pieces have been manufactured from a strong, resilient plastic known as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS).<ref name="Pickering15" /><ref name="Companyprofile" /> As of September 2008, Lego engineers use the [[NX (software)|NX]] [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]]/[[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] [[Product Lifecycle Management|PLM]] software suite to model the elements. The software allows the parts to be optimised by way of mould flow and [[stress analysis]]. Prototype moulds are sometimes built before the design is committed to mass production. The ABS plastic is heated to {{convert|232|C|0|abbr=on}} until it reaches a [[dough]]-like consistency. It is then injected into the moulds at pressures between 25 and 150 tonnes, and takes approximately 15 seconds to cool. The moulds are permitted a tolerance of up to twenty [[micrometre]]s, to ensure the bricks remain connected.<ref name="3d" /> Human inspectors check the output of the moulds, to eliminate significant variations in colour or thickness. According to the Lego Group, about eighteen bricks out of every million fail to meet the standard required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cache.lego.com/upload/contentTemplating/AboutUsFactsAndFiguresContent/otherfiles/download98E142631E71927FDD52304C1C0F1685.pdf|title=Company Profile An Introduction to the LEGO Group 2010|year=2011|publisher=The Lego Group|page=8|accessdate=21 May 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209100137/http://cache.lego.com/upload/contentTemplating/AboutUsFactsAndFiguresContent/otherfiles/download98E142631E71927FDD52304C1C0F1685.pdf|archivedate=9 December 2012}}</ref> Lego factories recycle all but about 1 percent of their [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]] from the manufacturing process.

[[File:Lego Sets In Store Leicester Square London United Kingdom.jpg|thumb|Lego sets of the Lego City theme]]
Since the 1950s, the Lego Group has released thousands of sets with a variety of themes, including [[Lego Space|space]], [[robots]], [[Lego Pirates|pirates]], [[Lego Trains|trains]], [[Lego Vikings|Vikings]], [[Lego Castle|castle]], [[Lego Adventurers#Dino Island (2000)|dinosaurs]], [[Lego Aquazone|undersea exploration]], and [[Lego Wild West|wild west]]. Some of the classic themes that continue to the present day include [[Lego City]] (a line of sets depicting city life introduced in 1973) and [[Lego Technic]] (a line aimed at emulating complex machinery, introduced in 1977).{{sfn|Wiencek|1987|p=54}}

Over the years, Lego has licensed themes from numerous cartoon and film franchises and even some from video games. These include ''[[Lego Batman|Batman]]'', ''[[Lego Indiana Jones|Indiana Jones]]'', ''[[Lego Pirates of the Caribbean|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', ''[[Lego Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'', ''[[Lego Star Wars|Star Wars]]'', and [[Lego Minecraft|''Minecraft'']]. Although some of the licensed themes, Lego Star Wars and Lego Indiana Jones, had highly successful sales, Lego has expressed a desire to rely more upon their own characters and classic themes, and less upon licensed themes related to movie releases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lego Mindstorms and Harry Potter Will Continue.|url=http://www.lego.com/en-GB/aboutus/news-room/2004/january/mindstorms-and-harry-potter-will-continue|website=Lego|accessdate=25 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914134304/http://www.lego.com/en-GB/aboutus/news-room/2004/january/mindstorms-and-harry-potter-will-continue|archivedate=14 September 2015}}</ref>

=== Robotics themes ===
{{Main|Lego Mindstorms|Lego Mindstorms NXT|Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0|Lego Mindstorms EV3}}
Lego also initiated a [[robotics]] line of toys called 'Mindstorms' in 1999, and has continued to expand and update this range ever since. The roots of the product originate from a programmable brick developed at the [[MIT Media Lab]], and the name is taken from a paper by [[Seymour Papert]], a computer scientist and educator who developed the educational theory of [[Constructionism (learning theory)|constructionism]], and whose research was at times funded by the [[Lego Group]].<ref name="Mindstorms History">{{cite web|title=Mindstorms History|url=http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/history|website=Lego|accessdate=6 September 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831053906/http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/history|archivedate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

The programmable Lego brick which is at the heart of these robotics sets has undergone several updates and redesigns, with the latest being called the 'EV3' brick, being sold under the name of Lego Mindstorms EV3. The set includes sensors that detect touch, light, sound and ultrasonic waves, with several others being sold separately, including an [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] reader.<ref name="About EV3">{{cite web|title=About EV3|url=http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/about-ev3|website=Lego|accessdate=6 September 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905160032/http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/about-ev3|archivedate=5 September 2015}}</ref>

The intelligent brick can be programmed using official software available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X|Mac]] computers, and is downloaded onto the brick via [[Bluetooth]] or a USB cable. There are also several unofficial programs and compatible programming languages that have been made to work with the brick, and many books have been written to support this community.<ref name="About EV3" />

There are several robotics competitions which use the Lego robotics sets. The earliest is [[Botball]], a national U.S. [[middle school|middle]]- and [[high-school]] competition stemming from the MIT 6.270 Lego robotics tournament. Other Lego robotics competitions include [[FIRST Lego League Jr.|Junior FIRST LEGO League]] (Jr.FLL) for students ages 6–9 and [[FIRST Lego League]] (FLL) for students ages 9–16 (age 9–14 in the United States, Canada, and Mexico). Jr.FLL and FLL offer real-world engineering challenges to participants. FLL uses Lego-based robots to complete tasks. Jr.FLL participants build models out of Lego elements. In its 2010 season, there were 16,070 FLL teams in over 55 countries. In its 2010 season, there were 2,147 Jr.FLL teams with 12,882 total student participants in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The international [[RoboCup Junior]] [[Association football|football]] competition involves extensive use of [[Lego Mindstorms]] equipment which is often pushed to its extreme limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usfirst.org|title=USFIRST.org|publisher=USFIRST.org|accessdate=3 October 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003051426/http://www.usfirst.org/|archivedate=3 October 2011}}</ref>

The capabilities of the Mindstorms range have now been harnessed for use in Iko Creative Prosthetic System, a prosthetic limbs system designed for children. Designs for these Lego prosthetics allow everything from mechanical diggers to laser-firing spaceships to be screwed on to the end of a child's limb. Iko is the work of the Chicago-based Colombian designer Carlos Arturo Torres, and is a modular system that allows children to customise their own prosthetics with the ease of clicking together plastic bricks. Designed with Lego's Future Lab, the Danish toy company's experimental research department, and Cirec, a Colombian foundation for physical rehabilitation, the modular prosthetic incorporates myoelectric sensors that register the activity of the muscle in the stump and send a signal to control movement in the attachment. A processing unit in the body of the prosthetic contains an engine compatible with Lego Mindstorms, the company's robotics line, which lets the wearer build an extensive range of customised, programmable limbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves|title=The Lego prosthetic arm that children can create and hack themselves|first=Oliver|last=Wainwright|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723183344/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/29865/IKO-Creative-Prosthetic-System|title=IKO Creative Prosthetic System|work=[[Core77]]|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723184938/http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/29865/IKO-Creative-Prosthetic-System|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref>

Participants work through imaginary scenarios using visual three-dimensional Lego constructions, imaginatively exploring possibilities in a serious form of play.<ref>{{cite web|title=Serious Play|url=http://www.lego.com/en-us/seriousplay|website=Lego|accessdate=6 September 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912081309/http://www.lego.com/en-us/seriousplay|archivedate=12 September 2015}}</ref>

Examples of the games include "Minotaurus", in which players roll dice to move characters within a brick-build labyrinth, "Creationary", in which players must build something which appears on a card, or "Ramses Pyramid", in which players collect gems and climb up a customisable pyramid. Like many board games, the games use [[dice]]. In Lego Games, the dice are Lego, with Lego squares with symbols on Lego studs on the dice, surrounded by rubber. The games vary from simple to complex; some are similar to "traditional" board games, while others are completely different.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lego Games|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/2909/lego-games|website=Board Game Geek|accessdate=6 September 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013923/http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/2909/lego-games|archivedate=15 September 2015}}</ref>
