'''John Dennis Hastert''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|s|t|ər|t}}; born January 2, 1942) is an American former politician and convicted felon who represented {{ushr|IL|14}} from 1987 to 2007 and served as the [[List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives|51st Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] from 1999 to 2007,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/18/ex-speaker-dennis-hastert-released-federal-prison/487193001/|title=Ex-speaker Dennis Hastert released from federal prison|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}</ref> the [[List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives#List of Speakers by time in office|longest-serving]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Speaker of the House in history.

From 1965 to 1981, Hastert was a high school teacher and coach at [[Yorkville High School]] in Yorkville, Illinois. He lost a 1980 bid for the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], but ran again and won a seat in 1981.  He was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1986, and was re-elected every two years until he retired in 2007. Hastert rose through the Republican ranks in the House, becoming [[Whip (politics)#United States|chief deputy whip]] in 1995 and Speaker in 1999. As Speaker of the House, Hastert supported the [[George W. Bush administration]]'s foreign and domestic policies. After Democrats took control of the House in 2007 following the [[United States House of Representatives election, 2006|2006 elections]], Hastert declined to seek the position of minority leader, resigned his House seat, and became a lobbyist at the firm of [[Dickstein Shapiro]].

On May 28, 2015, Hastert was indicted on federal charges of [[structuring]] bank withdrawals to evade [[currency transaction report|bank reporting requirements]] and [[making false statements]] to federal investigators. Federal prosecutors said that the funds withdrawn by Hastert were used as [[hush money]] to conceal past sexual misconduct by Hastert. In October 2015, Hastert entered into a [[plea agreement]] with prosecutors.  Under the agreement, Hastert [[Guilty plea|pleaded guilty]] to the structuring charge (a [[felony]]); the charge of making false statements was dropped.<ref name="PleadsGuiltyNYT">{{cite news|first1=Monica|last1=Davey|first2=Mitch|last2=Smith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/dennis-hastert-guilty-plea.html|title=Dennis Hastert, Ex-Speaker of House, Pleads Guilty|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=October 28, 2015|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref> In court submissions filed in April 2016, federal prosecutors alleged that Hastert had [[child sexual abuse|molested]] at least four boys as young as 14 years of age during his time as a high school wrestling coach.<ref name="DaveySmithSentencing">{{cite news|first1=Monica|last1=Davey|first2=Mitch|last2=Smith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/us/dennis-hastert-molested-at-least-four-boys-prosecutors-say.html|title=Hastert Molested at Least Four Boys, Prosecutors Say|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=April 8, 2016|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}</ref> At a sentencing hearing, Hastert admitted that he had sexually abused boys whom he had coached.<ref name="TribSentencing"/> Referring to Hastert as a "serial child molester", a federal judge imposed a sentence of 15 months in prison, two years' [[supervised release]], and a $250,000 fine.<ref name="NYTSentence"/><ref name="APSentencing">{{cite news|last=Tarm|first=Michael|date=April 27, 2016|title=Dennis Hastert Sentenced to 15 Months in Prison|work=[[WBEZ]]|url=https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/dennis-hastert-sentenced-to-15-months-in-prison/62c95fc7-2dc9-4c5d-8a70-ef5131a2140a|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=February 19, 2019}}</ref> Hastert was imprisoned in 2016 and was released 13 months later.<ref name="MadhaniReleased">{{cite news|first=Aamer|last=Madhani|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/18/ex-speaker-dennis-hastert-released-federal-prison/487193001/|title=Ex-Speaker Dennis Hastert released from federal prison|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=McLean, Virginia|date=July 18, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>

In 1973, Hastert married a fellow teacher at the high school, Jean Kahl, with whom he had two sons.<ref name="Eilperin"/>

==Illinois House of Representatives==
Hastert considered applying to become an assistant principal at the school, but then decided to enter politics, although at the time "he knew nothing about politics."<ref name="Smith"/> Hastert approached Phyllis Oldenburg, a Republican operative in [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall County]], seeking advice on running for a seat in the [[Illinois Legislature]].<ref name="Smith"/>

Hastert lost a 1980 Republican [[Primary election|primary]] for the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], but showed a talent for campaigning, and after the election, volunteered for an influential [[Illinois State Senate|state senator]], [[John E. Grotberg]].<ref name="Smith"/> In the summer of 1981, however, State Representative Al Schoeberiein had become terminally ill, and Republican party bosses selected Hastert as the successor over two major rivals, [[West Chicago, Illinois|West Chicago]] lawyer Tom Johnson and Mayor Richard Verbic of [[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]].<ref name="Eilperin"/><ref name="Kemper1999"/> The first round of balloting resulted in a tie, but Hastert was chosen after Grotberg interceded on Hastert's behalf.<ref name="Eilperin"/>

Hastert served three terms in the state House.<ref name="Kemper1999"/> He served on the Appropriations Committee.<ref name="Eilperin"/> According to a 1999 ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' profile, in the state House "Hastert quickly staked out a place on the far right of the political spectrum, once earning a place on the '[[Moral Majority]] Honor Roll.' Yet, he also displayed yeoman-like work habits and an ability to put aside partisanship."<ref name="Kemper1999"/> He gained a reputation as a dealmaker and party leader known for "asking his colleagues to write their spending requests on a notepad so he could carry them into negotiating sessions" and holding early-morning pre-meetings to organize talking points.<ref name="Eilperin"/> One of his first moves in the House was to help block passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]; the state House Speaker [[George Ryan]] appointed Hastert to a committee that worked to prevent the ERA from coming to the House floor.<ref name="Kemper1999"/> In the state House, Hastert opposed [[LGBT rights in the United States|bills barring discrimination against gays]]; supported (unsuccessfully) proposals to raise the [[Driver's license in the United States|driving age]] to 18; and voted for a [[Seat belt legislation in the United States|mandatory seat belt]] law, although he later voted to repeal it.<ref name="Kemper1999"/>

In 1986, at the urging of [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]] [[James R. Thompson]], Hastert developed a plan to deregulate Illinois utility companies.<ref name="Kemper1999"/> Under the plan developed by Hastert and Republican staffers, [[Property tax|property]] and [[Gross receipts tax|gross-receipts taxes]] that utilities paid would be eliminated and replaced with a "state service tax" that service-industry businesses (ranging from insurers to funeral homes) would pay.<ref name="Kemper1999"/> Critics of the plan said that it was too favorable to utility companies, and the proposal was not adopted.<ref name="Kemper1999"/>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Meanwhile, Hastert's political mentor Grotberg had been elected to Congress as the representative from [[Illinois's 14th congressional district|Illinois's 14th district]], but was diagnosed with [[cancer]] in 1986, and was unable to run for a second term.<ref name="Smith"/><ref name="Eilperin"/> Hastert was nominated to replace him; in the general election in November 1986, he defeated Democratic candidate Mary Lou Kearns, the [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane County]] [[coroner]], in a relatively close race.<ref name="Smith"/><ref name="Eilperin"/>

Hastert was then reelected in his [[Fox Valley (Illinois)|Fox Valley]]-centered district several times, by wider margins, aided by his role in [[redistricting]] following the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]].<ref name="Eilperin"/>

Following the [[House banking scandal]], which broke in 1992, it was revealed that Hastert had [[Non-sufficient funds|bounced]] 44 checks during the period under investigation.<ref name="Kemper1999"/><ref name="BankingScandalClear">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-09-15/news/9203240062_1_house-banking-scandal-house-bank-scandal-list-of-house-members|title=U.S. Clears Rep.

As a protégé of [[House Minority Leader]] [[Robert H. Michel]], Hastert rose through the Republican ranks in the House, and in 1995 (after the Republicans gained control of the House and [[Newt Gingrich]] became Speaker), Hastert became chief deputy [[Whip (politics)|whip]].<ref name="Eilperin"/> Michel appointed Hastert to the Republicans' health care task force,<ref name="Kemper1999"/> where Hastert became a "prominent voice" in helping defeat the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]].<ref name="Picard">{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Picard|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/206570-hastert-recalls-his-time-in-the-backroom|title=Hastert recalls his time in the backroom|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|publisher=Capitol Hill Publishing|location=Washington, D.C.|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref><ref name="AllenVox">{{cite web|first=Jonathan|last=Allen|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/5/29/8685775/dennis-hastert-secrets|title=Dennis Hastert has a history of keeping secrets|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|location=New York City|date=May 29, 2015}}</ref>

Hastert developed a close relationship with [[Tom DeLay]], the House majority whip, and was widely seen as DeLay's deputy.<ref name="Eilperin"/> Hastert and DeLay first worked together in 1989, on [[Edward Madigan]]'s unsuccessful race against Gingrich for minority whip. Hastert later managed DeLay's successful campaign to become whip.<ref name="Eilperin"/> In September 1998, the two added an extra $250,000 to the Defense Department appropriations bill for "[[pharmacokinetics]] research" which paid for an Army experiment with [[nicotine gum|nicotine chewing gum]] manufactured by the Amurol Confections Company in Yorkville, in Hastert's district.<ref name="Eilperin"/><ref name="Gum">{{cite news|first1=Mike|last1=Dorning|first2=Michael|last2=Kilian|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-10-14/news/9810140104_1_chewing-gum-rep-dennis-hastert|title=Hastert Sticks Gum Money Into The Budget's Fine Print|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=October 14, 1998}}</ref> On the House floor, Democratic Representative [[Peter DeFazio]] criticized the insertion of the provision; Hastert defended it.<ref name="Gum"/> Hastert played "[[Good cop/bad cop|good cop]]" to DeLay's "bad cop."<ref>''How Congress Works'', 5th ed.

On the eve of his elevation to Speaker, Hastert was described as "deeply conservative at heart" by the [[Associated Press]].<ref name="Loven">{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Loven|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19981223&id=K_EyAAAAIBAJ&pg=6711,5780805&hl=en|title=Hastert moderate-mannered but deeply conservative|newspaper=[[The Free-Lance Star]]|publisher=[[BH Media]]|location=Fredericksburg, Virginia|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=December 23, 1998}}</ref> The AP reported: "He is an [[evangelical Christian]] who opposes [[abortion]] and advocates lower taxes, a [[Balanced budget amendment|balanced-budget amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] and the [[death penalty]].

===Speaker of the House===
[[File:Dennis Hastert 2.jpg|thumb|Hastert presiding over the House of Representatives during the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]].]]

In the aftermath of the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1998|1998 midterm elections]], where the GOP lost five House seats and failed to make a net gain of seats in the Senate, House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] stepped down from the speakership and declined to take his seat for an 11th term. In mid-December, Representative [[Robert L. Livingston]] of [[Louisiana]] — the former chairman of the [[House Appropriations Committee]] and the Speaker-designate — stated in a dramatic surprise announcement on the House floor that he would not become Speaker, following widely publicized revelations of his extramarital affairs.<ref name="Picard"/><ref>{{cite news|first=Katharine Q.|last=Seelye|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/20/us/impeachment-the-fallout-livingston-urges-clinton-to-follow-suit.html|title=Impeachment: The Fallout: Livingston Urges Clinton to Follow Suit|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=December 20, 1998}}</ref><ref name="Pianin">{{cite news|first=Eric|last=Pianin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/livingston122098.htm|title=Livingston Quits as Speaker-Designate|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Nash Holdings]]|location=Washington D.C.|date=December 20, 1998|page=A1}}</ref>

Although he reportedly had no warning of Livingston's decision to step aside, Hastert "began lobbying on the House floor within moments" of Livingston's announcement, and by the afternoon of that day had secured the public backing of the House Republican leadership, including Gingrich, DeLay (who was "viewed as too partisan to step into the role of Speaker") and [[Dick Armey]] (who was "viewed as too weak" and was damaged by party infighting).<ref name="Picard"/><ref name="Pianin"/>  On that day, Hastert was endorsed by about 100 Republican representatives, ranging from conservatives such as [[Steve Largent]] to moderates such as [[Mike Castle]], for the speakership.<ref name="Pianin"/> Representative [[Christopher Cox]] of California, viewed as a potential rival, decided by evening not to challenge Hastert for the speakership.<ref name="Pianin"/> Hastert became known as "the Accidental Speaker."<ref name="Dorning"/><ref>{{cite news|first=Katherine|last=Skiba|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-hastert-indictment-bio-met-0529-20150528-story.html|title=Hastert, the accidental House speaker, faces own scandal after noted career|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=June 4, 2015}}</ref>

In accepting the position, Hastert broke the tradition that the new speaker deliver his first address from the speaker's chair, instead delivering his seventeen-minute acceptance speech from the floor.<ref name="Acceptance">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/07/us/106th-congress-remarks-congress-dennis-hastert-his-first-day-speaker-house.html?pagewanted=all |title=The 106th Congress: Remarks to Congress by Dennis Hastert in His First Day as Speaker of the House|date=January 7, 1999|agency=[[Federal News Service]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City}}</ref> Hastert adopted a conciliatory tone and pledged to work for bipartisanship, saying that: "Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness."<ref name="Acceptance"/><ref name="Sworn">{{cite news|first=Katharine Q.|last=Seelye|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/010799house.html|title=Hastert Is Sworn In as 51st Speaker and Puts Forth a Conciliatory Tone|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=January 7, 1999}}</ref>

Nevertheless, in November 2004, Hastert instituted what became known as the [[Hastert Rule]] (or "[[majority of the majority]]" rule), which was an informal, self-imposed political practice of allowing the House to vote on only those bills that were supported by the majority of its Republican members. The practice received criticism as an unduly partisan measure both at the time it was adopted and in the subsequent years.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15423-2004Nov26.html | work=[[The Washington Post]] | publisher=[[Washington Post Company]]|location=Washington D.C.|title=Hastert Launches a Partisan Policy | first=Charles | last=Babington | date=November 27, 2004 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Timothy|last=Noah|url=https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-absurdity-the-hastert-rule|title=The absurdity of the Hastert Rule|website=[[MSNBC]]|date=September 27, 2013}}</ref> The same year, the Hastert aide who coined the phrase also stated that the structure was not workable.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Molly|last=Ball|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/07/even-the-aide-who-coined-the-hastert-rule-says-the-hastert-rule-isnt-working/277961/|title=Even the Aide Who Coined the Hastert Rule Says the Hastert Rule Isn't Working|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=July 21, 2013}}</ref> In any case, a number of bills subsequently passed the House without the support of a majority of the majority party in the House, as shown by a list compiled by ''The New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/house/hastert-rule|title=House Votes Violating the "Hastert Rule"|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417130703/http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/house/hastert-rule |archive-date=April 17, 2013 }}</ref> In 2013, after leaving office, Hastert disowned the policy, saying that "there is no Hastert Rule" and that the "rule" was more of a principle that the majority party should follow its own policies.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Alex|last=Seitz-Wald|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/dennis-hastert-there-is-no-hastert-rule-20131003|title=Dennis Hastert: 'There Is No Hastert Rule': The former House Speaker disowns his eponymous rule|magazine=[[National Journal]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|location=Washington D.C.|date=October 3, 2013}}</ref>

Congressional expert [[Norm Ornstein]] writes that Hastert "blew up" the House's "regular order," which is "a mix of rules and norms that allows debate, deliberation, and amendments in committees and on the House floor, that incorporates and does not shut out the minority (even if it still loses most of the time), that takes bills that pass both houses to a conference committee to reconcile differences, [and] that allows time for members and staff to read, digest, and analyze bills."<ref name="OrnsteinHastert">{{cite magazine|first=Norm|last=Ornstein|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/dennis-hastert-scandal/394754/|title=This Isn't Dennis Hastert's First Scandal|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=June 3, 2015}}</ref> Ornstein commented that "no speaker did more to relegate the regular order to the sidelines than Hastert. ... The House is a very partisan institution, with rules structured to give even tiny majorities enormous leverage. But Hastert took those realities to a new and more tribalized, partisan plane."<ref name="OrnsteinHastert"/> Despite this shift, Hastert was widely seen as "affable" and low-key; he did not seek the limelight, "become a regular on [[Sunday morning talk show|Sunday talk shows]] or anything close to a household word or figure," or "openly exhibit the kind of snarling or mean partisan demeanor that made Tom DeLay such a mark of hatred for Democrats."<ref name="OrnsteinHastert"/>

Hastert adopted a much lower profile in the media than conventional wisdom would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a [[figurehead]] for DeLay.<ref>{{cite news| first1=Michael | last1=Grunwald | first2=Jim | last2=VandeHei| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/15/AR2006101501096.html |title=Hastert's Team Mentality to Be Tested as Foley Scandal Unfolds| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington DC | date=October 16, 2006 | accessdate=November 15, 2012 }}</ref> In 2005, [[Tom DeLay campaign finance trial|DeLay was indicted]] by a Texas [[grand jury]] on charges of campaign-finance violations.

====106th Congress====
In March 1999, soon after Hastert's elevation to the speakership, the ''Washington Post'', in a front-page story, reported that Hastert "has begun offering industry lobbyists the kind of deal they like: private audiences where, for a price, they can voice their views on what kind of agenda the [[106th United States Congress|106th Congress]] should pursue."<ref name="EilperinMarch1999">{{cite news|first=Juliet|last=Eilperin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/hastert031099.htm|title=Hastert Drawing Crowds of Lobbyists|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Nash Holdings]]|location=Washington D.C.|date=March 10, 1999|page=A1}}</ref> Hastert's style and extensive fundraising led [[Common Cause]] to critique the "[[pay-to-play]] system" in Congress.<ref name="EilperinMarch1999"/>

Hastert was known as a frequent critic of [[Bill Clinton]], and immediately upon assuming the speakership, he "played a lead role" in the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment of the president]].<ref name="Seidel"/> Nevertheless, Hastert and the Clinton administration did work together on several initiatives, including the [[New Markets Tax Credit Program]] and [[Plan Colombia]].<ref name="Picard"/>

In 2000, Hastert announced he would support an [[Armenian Genocide]] resolution. Analysts noted that at the time there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large [[Armenians|Armenian]] community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights Subcommittee of the House and the International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution on the eve of the full House vote. He explained this by saying that he had received a letter from Clinton asking him to withdraw it, because it would harm U.S. interests.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Crowley|first1=Michael|title=Final Resolution|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/61335/final-resolution|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=22 July 2007}}</ref> Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, an official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by [[Sibel Edmonds]], that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.<ref name="vanity"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2005/8/10/did_speaker_hastert_accept_turkish_bribes|title=Did Speaker Hastert Accept Turkish Bribes to Deny Armenian Genocide and Approve Weapons Sales?|website=[[Democracy Now!]]|language=en|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>

Before the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|2006 election]], Hastert expressed his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained control of the House. Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term to his seat in the House with nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and the House to the Democrats following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina, and a series of scandals among congressional Republicans.<ref>[[Carl Hulse]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/us/politics/08house.html On Wave of Voter Unrest, Democrats Take Control of House], ''The New York Times'' (November 8, 2006).</ref> The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] convened in January 2007.<ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/15623951/ns/politics/t/hastert-says-he-wont-run-minority-leader/ Hastert says he won't run for minority leader], NBC News (November 9, 2006).</ref> Later that month, [[John Boehner]] of [[Ohio]] defeated [[Mike Pence]] of Indiana in a 168–27 vote of the [[House Republican Conference]] election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress.<ref name="Taylor">Andrew Taylor, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/17/AR2006111700485.html GOP Chooses Boehner as Minority Leader], Associated Press (November 17, 2006).</ref> The [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|House Democratic Caucus]] unanimously selected House Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.<ref name="Taylor"/>

[[Yorkville, Illinois]]; salaries for three staffers (secretary Lisa Post and administrative assistants Bryan Harbin and Tom Jarman, each paid an annual salary of more than $100,000 over 2½ years); lease payments on a 2008 [[GMC Yukon]] [[sport utility vehicle]]; a [[satellite TV]] subscription; office equipment; and legal fees.<ref name="Final"/><ref name="Flavelle"/><ref name="Sherman"/> Jarman later left the office, and Harbin's salary was cut substantially.<ref name="Final"/>  Hastert's government-funded office closed in late 2012, at the end of the maximum five years for which public funds were provided.<ref name="Final"/> The total amount of public funds spent on Hastert's post-speakership office was nearly $1.9 million (not including federal benefits such as health care to which the employees were entitled), of which the majority (about $1.45 million) went toward staff salaries.<ref name="Final"/>

Reinboldt died of an [[AIDS]]-related illness in 1995.<ref name="ReinboldtABC"/> Hastert attended his [[Viewing (funeral)|viewing]], which angered Burdge; she said:

At the sentencing hearing on April 27, 2016, the government presented two witnesses. Jolene Burdge, the sister of Stephen Reinboldt, read a letter that her brother had written shortly before his death in 1995. Addressing Hastert, Burdge stated that she wanted to "hold you accountable for sexually abusing my brother. I knew your secret, and you couldn't bribe or intimidate your way out. ...

====Reactions====
Following the sentence, the ''Chicago Tribune'' editorial board praised "the bravery of the victims and their families who confronted the man who was once second in line to be president" and wrote of the sentence: "The enduring impact is that the truth has been revealed.
