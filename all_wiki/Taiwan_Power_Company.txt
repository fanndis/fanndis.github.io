The '''Taiwan Power Company''' ('''Taipower'''; {{zh|c=台灣電力公司|p=Táiwān Diànlì Gōngsī}}) is a state-owned [[electric power industry]] providing [[electricity]] to [[Taiwan]] and off-shore islands of the [[Republic of China]].

==History==
Taipower was established on 1 May 1946. In 1994 a measure which allowed independent power producers (IPP's) to provide up to 20 percent of [[Taiwan]]'s [[electricity]] should have ended the [[monopoly]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Taiwan, Electric Power| publisher =Energy Information Administration (EIA)| date =August 19, 2005| url =http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/taiwan.html| accessdate =2006-12-13| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061215030951/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/taiwan.html| archivedate =December 15, 2006}}</ref> On 1 October 2012, Taipower allied with [[Taiwan Water Corporation]] to provide cross-agency integrated services called ''Water and Power Associated Service'' that accepts summary transactions between the two utilities. On 11 October 2012, the Economics Committee of the [[Legislative Yuan]] cut Taipower's budget for power purchases from [[Independent Power Producer|IPP]].<ref name="taipower.com.tw"/>

In July 2015, the [[Executive Yuan]] approved the amendments to the Electricity Act which were proposed by the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]], which will divide Taipower into two separate [[Corporate group|business groups]] in the next five to nine years: a [[Electricity generation|power generation]] company and a [[Electric power transmission|power grid]] company. The measures were taken to improve efficiency within the company and to encourage positive competition within the industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/business/2015/07/17/440926/Taipower-to.htm|title=Taipower to be torn apart in attempt to improve efficiency|publisher=}}</ref>

On 20 October 2016, the Executive Yuan passed an amendments to the Electricity Act according to which Taipower will be divided into subsidiary companies in 6–9 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/10/21/2003657595|title=Cabinet approves Taipower break up - Taipei Times|publisher=}}</ref>

== Operations ==
Taipower operates all of Taiwan's two active nuclear power plants. It also operates [[coal]] power plants, but these are planned to be shut down in favor of natural gas turbines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201911040010.aspx|title=Taipower takes steps to cut coal consumption at Taichung plant {{!}} Economics {{!}} FOCUS TAIWAN - CNA ENGLISH NEWS|website=focustaiwan.tw|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>

The company is expecting its first deliveries of [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) in 2023 as Taipower is moving away from coal for power generation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-lng-conference-taipower-idUSKCN1QO137|title=Taipower expects to start LNG imports from 2023|date=2019-03-07|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-28|language=en}}</ref>

=== Financials ===
As of 2019, Taipower is the only Taiwanese state-owned company that is losing money, reporting a loss of [[New Taiwan dollar|NT]]$29.7 billion (US$955 million) during the first six months of 2019, a minus of NT$5.7 billion compared to the same period of 2018.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3746307|title=Taiwan state utility Taipower sees losses esc...|last=News|first=Taiwan|website=Taiwan News|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref> The company attributed this on rising [[fuel]] prices and various anti-pollution measures which increased the costs of energy production.<ref name=":0" />[[File:Taipower Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Taiwan Power Company headquarters]]
