'''Microsoft Bob''' was a [[Microsoft]] [[software]] product that was released on March 11, 1995 and discontinued in early 1996. The program was intended to provide a more user-friendly interface for the [[Windows 3.1x]], [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT]] operating systems, supplanting the Windows [[Program Manager]]. Microsoft Bob presented screens showing a "house", with "rooms" that the user could go to containing familiar objects corresponding to computer applications—for instance, a desk with pen and paper, a checkbook, and other items. In this case, clicking on the pen and paper would open the word processor.

A cartoon dog named Rover and other cartoon characters provided guidance using [[speech balloon]]s. Rover and a few others later returned in Windows XP as "Search Companions".

Upon release, Microsoft Bob was criticized in the media and did not gain wide acceptance with users, which resulted in its discontinuation.

==History==
Microsoft Bob was released in March 1995 (before Windows 95 was released), although it had been widely publicized prior to that date under the codename "Utopia".<ref>{{cite news | title=MS plans Utopia for PC users | journal=Computer Shoqqer |date=April 1994 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Microsoft makes for Utopia | journal=Personal Computer World |date=May 1994 }}</ref> The project leader for Bob was [[Karen Fries]], a Microsoft researcher. The design was based on research by Professors [[Clifford Nass]] and Byron Reeves of [[Stanford University]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/193006/the_bob_chronicles.html | title = The Bob Chronicles | first = Harry | last = McCracken | date = March 31, 2010 | work = [[PC World]] | publisher = [[International Data Group|IDG]] | accessdate = 2010-04-18}}</ref> [[Melinda Gates]], wife of [[Bill Gates]], was marketing manager for the product.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/failure-taught-me-lesson-ill-never-forget-melinda-gates|title=This failure taught me a lesson I’ll never forget|last=Gates|first=Melinda|authorlink=Melinda Gates|date=October 8, 2017|website=[[LinkedIn]]|language=en|access-date=July 3, 2019}}</ref> Microsoft originally purchased the [[domain name]] bob.com from Boston-area [[wikt:techie|techie]] Bob Antia, but later traded it to Bob Kerstein for the [[Windows 2000|windows2000.com]] domain name.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theregister.com/1999/11/11/windows2000_com_owner_sells_domain/ | title=Windows2000.com owner sells domain to Microsoft | work=[[The Register]] | date=11 November 1999 | accessdate=2006-10-24 | author-last=Lea | author-first=Graham |author-link=Graham Lea (journalist)}}</ref>

==Applications==
[[File:Microsoft-Bob-screenshot.png|thumb|right|A screenshot of the "family room" area of the Microsoft Bob software, including the "Assistant" character Rover.]]Bob included various office suite programs such as a finance application and a [[word processor]]. The user interface was designed to simplify the navigational experience for novice computer users.

Similar to early graphical shells like [[Jane (software)|Jane]], the main interface is portrayed as the inside of a house, with different rooms corresponding to common real-world room styles such as a kitchen or family room. Each room contains decorations and furniture, as well as [[Icon (computing)|icons]] that represent applications. Bob offers the user the option of fully customizing the entire house. The user has full control over decorating each room, and can add, remove, or reposition all objects. The user can also add or remove rooms from the house and change the destinations of each door. There is also a feature in which Bob offers multiple themes for room designs and decorations, such as contemporary and [[postmodern]].<ref name="Nathan Lineback">{{cite web | url=http://toastytech.com/guis/bob2.html | title=Microsoft Bob | work=Nathan's Toasty Technology | accessdate=11 May 2012 | author=Nathan Lineback}}</ref>

The applications built into Bob are represented by matching decorations – for example, clicking on a clock opens the calendar, while a pen and paper represent the word processor. The user can also add shortcuts to applications on their computer. These shortcuts display the icon inside various styles of decorations such as boxes and picture frames.<ref name="Nathan Lineback"/>

Released right as the Internet was beginning to become popular, Bob offered an email client with which a user could subscribe to [[MCI Mail]], a dial-up email account.  The price was $5.00 per month to send up to 15 emails per month.  Each email was limited to 5000 characters, and each additional email after the limit was reached was an additional 45 cents.  A toll-free phone number had to be called to set up the account.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://technologizer.com/2010/03/29/a-guided-tour-of-microsoft-bob/6/ | title=A Guided Tour of Microsoft Bob | publisher=Technologizer, Inc | work=Technologizer | date=29 March 2010 | accessdate=8 April 2011 | last=McCracken | first=Harry}}</ref>

Bob features "Assistants", cartoon characters intended to help the user navigate the virtual house or perform tasks in the main interface or within the built-in applications.

==Gateway 2000 Edition==
An edition of Microsoft Bob was bundled with the [[Gateway 2000]] computer around 1995. The Gateway Edition contained Gateway branding on the Login screen along with additional rooms and backgrounds not seen in the retail version. One additional room was the attic, which contained the box to a Gateway 2000 computer. Along with the additional rooms, there were more icons that appeared by default in the new rooms.<ref name=":0">{{cite web | url=http://www.danielsays.com/ms-bob-06-bob-home.html | title=The "Bob Home" | work=DanielSays.com | accessdate=5 May 2012 | last=Rose | first=Daniel | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171337/http://www.danielsays.com/ms-bob-06-bob-home.html | archive-date=10 December 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Reception and legacy==
Microsoft Bob was one of Microsoft's more visible product failures.<ref name=win-conf>{{cite web | url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.07.windowsconfidential.aspx | title=Windows Confidential: History Taking Up Space | publisher=[[Microsoft]] | work=[[TechNet Magazine]] | date=July 2008 | accessdate=2013-06-15 | first=Raymond | last=Chen}}</ref> Despite being discontinued before [[Windows 95]] was released, Microsoft Bob continued to be severely criticized in reviews and popular media.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1636333,00.asp | title=The Bottom 10: Worst Software Disasters | publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] | work=[[PC World]] | date=16 August 2004 | accessdate=2007-09-21 | last=Dvorak | first=John C.}}</ref> In 2017, Melinda Gates acknowledged that the software "needed a more powerful computer than most people had back then".<ref name=":1" />

Bob received the 7th place in ''[[PC World]]'' magazine's list of the 25 worst tech products of all time,<ref name="pc25">{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | title=The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time | publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] | work=[[PC World]] | date=26 March 2006 | accessdate=2007-03-14 | last=Tynan | first=Dan}}</ref> number one worst product of the decade by [[CNET.com]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnettv.com/9710-1_53-25029.html?tag=cnetfd.mt | title=CNET Top 5: Worst products in a decade | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | work=[[CNET]] | date=30 April 2007 | accessdate=2007-09-21 | last=Merritt | first=Tom}}</ref> and a spot in a list of the 50 worst inventions published by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, who called Bob "overly cutesy" and an "operating system designed around [[Office Assistant|Clippy]]".<ref name="time">{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1991915_1991909_1991855,00.html | title=The 50 Worst Inventions | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=27 May 2010 | accessdate=2014-07-16 | first=Dan | last=Fletcher}}</ref> Microsoft's [[Steve Ballmer]] mentioned Bob as an example of a situation in which "we decided that we have not succeeded and let's stop [now]".<ref>{{cite news|first=Stacy |last=Cowley |title=Ballmer Analyzes Microsoft's 'One Big' Vista Mistake |url=http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/191600739/ballmer-analyzes-microsofts-one-big-vista-mistake.htm |work=[[CRN Magazine]] |publisher=The Channel Company |date=31 July 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930183532/http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/dailyarchives.jhtml%3Bjsessionid%3DZEQ0I0LMYJC1MQSNDLPCKHSCJUNN2JVN?articleId=191600739 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Microsoft employee Raymond Chen wrote in an article that an encrypted copy of Bob was included on [[Windows XP]] install CDs to take up space and slow down the downloading of illegal copies<ref name=win-conf />, a story later confirmed by Microsoft engineer [[David Plummer (programmer)|David Plummer]]. Tech journalist [[Harry McCracken]] called the story "a delightfully urban legend-y tale" and noted its similarities to an [[April Fools' Day]] joke claiming Bob was hidden in Windows Vista.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://technologizer.com/2010/03/29/windows-xp-a-free-copy-of-bob-in-every-box/ | title=Windows XP: A Free Copy of Bob in Every Box? | publisher=Technologizer, Inc | work=Technologizer | date=29 March 2010 | accessdate=2013-06-15 | first=Harry | last=McCracken}}</ref>

Rover, the software's dog mascot, reappeared in Windows XP's File Search function.

The [[typeface]] [[Comic Sans]] was created for (but not used in) Microsoft Bob.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fyti/typefaces/story-of-comic-sans | title=The Story Behind Comic Sans | publisher=Fonts.com | accessdate=2013-06-15 | last=Strizver | first=Ilene}}</ref>
