'''"Outposts of tyranny"''' was a term used in 2005 by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] and subsequently by others in the U.S. government to characterize the governments of certain countries as being [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes or [[dictatorship]]s. In addition to specifically identifying [[Belarus]], [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Union of Myanmar|Myanmar]], [[North Korea]] and [[Zimbabwe]] as examples of outpost of tyranny, Rice characterized the broader Middle East as a region of tyranny, despair, and anger.

==Usage==
In addition to using the expression "outposts of tyranny" in a 2005 written submission to the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]],{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Rice provided details to characterize "a fear society" in her prepared remarks before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 18, 2005:

{{quote|The world should apply what [[Natan Sharansky]] calls the "[[town square test]]": if a person cannot walk into the middle of the town square and express his or her views without fear of arrest, imprisonment, or physical harm, then that person is living in a fear society, not a free society. We cannot rest until every person living in a "fear society" has finally won their freedom.<ref name="Rice">

Rice went on to identify [[Belarus]], [[Burma]], [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[North Korea]] and [[Zimbabwe]] as examples of outposts of tyranny.<ref name="Rice"/> Other governments were implicitly criticized in her remarks by being part of the broader [[Middle East]]:

{{quote|In the [[Middle East]], President Bush has broken with six decades of excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the hope of purchasing stability at the price of liberty. The stakes could not be higher. As long as the broader Middle East remains a region of tyranny and despair and anger, it will produce extremists and movements that threaten the safety of Americans and our friends.}}

==Reactions==
The [[North Korean government]] took strong exception to the label, declaring that it would not return to [[six-party talks]] on the [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|Korean nuclear weapons crisis]] until the United States apologized. On June 21, 2005, [[Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs|U.S. Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs]] [[Paula Dobriansky]] used the term during a speech for the [[Hudson Institute]]: "North Korea, Burma, Zimbabwe and Cuba are outposts of tyranny." In response, the North Korean deputy ambassador to the [[United Nations]] [[Han Song-ryol]] stated, "Resuming the six-party talks would be possible if there is restraint on the part of the U.S. from using the words 'outpost of tyranny' for one month." [[South Korea]]n Foreign Minister [[Ban Ki-moon]] was concerned over the implications for [[North Korea–South Korea relations|inter-Korean relations]]: "It is regrettable for a high U.S. official to call North Korea an 'outpost of tyranny', which is not good for the two Koreas' efforts to have a reconciliatory atmosphere."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=060000&biid=2005062283838|title=donga.com[English donga]|work=donga.com}}</ref>

Similarly, [[South Africa]]n [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]], who had attempted to effect a conciliatory attitude to neighboring [[Zimbabwe]] by avoiding public criticism of the record of [[Robert Mugabe]], was displeased. "It's an exaggeration and whatever the U.S. government wants to do with that list of six countries, or however many, it's really somewhat discredited."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://iafrica.com/news/sa/601342.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303033838/http://iafrica.com/news/sa/601342.htm |archive-date=2006-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Some commentators have accused the U.S. of double standards in relation to the application of the "outposts of tyranny" tag since the named countries were limited to those routinely criticized by the U.S. State Department in its annual [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]] and the International Religious Freedom Report. For example, Amitabh Pal of ''[[The Progressive]]'' wrote that as Rice specifically refrained from applying the term to such states as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], and [[Azerbaijan]], it suggested that the administration had ulterior motives for its human rights pronouncements, which are "heavily subordinate to U.S. strategic and economic interests".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressive.org/?q=node/359|title=Outposts of tyranny" list is selective - The Progressive|work=progressive.org}}</ref>

''[[The Washington Post]]'' has published a series of forums and interviews pertaining to the countries which Rice chose as being examples of outposts of tyranny.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13620-2005Mar30.html|title=Outposts of Tyranny: Zimbabwe|work=washingtonpost.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28165-2005Apr5.html|title=Outposts of Tyranny: Belarus|work=washingtonpost.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28179-2005Apr5.html|title=Outposts of Tyranny: Cuba|work=washingtonpost.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28189-2005Apr5.html|title=Outposts of Tyranny: North Korea|work=washingtonpost.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28221-2005Apr5.html|title=Outposts of Tyranny: Iran|work=washingtonpost.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28229-2005Apr5.html|title=Outposts of Tyranny: Burma|work=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>

==Comparison to other state classifications and political neologisms==
The term has been compared to [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s phrase, "[[axis of evil]]", but the concepts are not identical. "Axis of evil" refers to countries alleged to be developing [[weapons of mass destruction]] as well as sponsoring [[terrorism]], while "outposts of tyranny" refers to a country's internal political system.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] has not used the term "outposts of tyranny" officially.
