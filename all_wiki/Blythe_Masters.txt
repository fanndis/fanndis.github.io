==Biography==

===Education===
Born in [[Oxford]], Masters was raised in the south-east of England. She attended [[The King's School, Canterbury|The King's School]] in [[Canterbury]].<ref name="guardian1">{{cite news|author=David Teather |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/20/wallstreet.banking |title=The woman who built financial 'weapon of mass destruction' &#124; Business |publisher=The Guardian |date= 20 September 2008|accessdate=19 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref> She graduated in 1991 from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] with a B.A. in economics.<ref name="Linkedin">{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/blythemasters  |title=Blythe Masters  |publisher=LinkedIn}}</ref>

===Professional career===
Masters joined the bank [[JP Morgan Chase]] in 1991 after completing a number of internships there while still a student dating back to 1987. Responsible for [[credit derivative]] products at J.P. Morgan, Masters became a managing director at 28, the youngest woman to achieve that status in the firm's history.<ref name="wallstreetjournal">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703927504575540241298913962 |title=J.P. Morgan Commodities Chief Takes the Heat | work=The Wall Street Journal |author=Dan Fitzpatrick |date=9 October 2010}}</ref> She is widely credited with creating the modern [[credit default swap]], a derivative used to manage credit exposure to underlying reference entities.<ref name="outsmarted">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/06/01/090601crbo_books_lanchester |title=Outsmarted: High finance vs. human nature |author=John Lanchester |date= 1 June 2009 |work=The New Yorker }}</ref> In 1994, J.P. Morgan had extended a $4.8 billion credit line to [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]], which faced the threat of $5 billion in punitive damages for the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]]. A team of J.P. Morgan bankers led by Masters then purchased credit protection against the credit line to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to cut the capital which J.P. Morgan was required to hold against Exxon's default, thus reducing its own risk. J.P. Morgan later bundled together packages of such exposures and offered them to market as BISTRO, for Broad Index Secured Trust Offering,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1321xvp9wjw1g/how-the-structured-credit-revolution-started |title=How the structured credit revolution started |author= Alex Chambers|date=1 May 2006|website=Euromoney}}</ref> and these new financial instruments were quickly adopted by other banking institutions.<ref name="outsmarted"/>

When derivatives played a role in the 2008 financial crisis, having been applied by other firms to sub-prime mortgages, [[Gillian Tett]]'s book, ''Fool's Gold: How the Bold Dreams of a Small Tribe at J.P. Morgan Was Corrupted by Wall Street Greed and Unleashed a Catastrophe'', documented how the original intent and features of credit derivatives had been distorted.<ref>''Fool's Gold: How the Bold Dreams of a Small Tribe at J.P. Morgan Was Corrupted by Wall Street Greed and Unleashed a Catastrophe'', by Gillian Tett: {{ISBN|978-1-4165-9857-2}}, Spear's Book Awards Financial Book of the Year 2009.</ref> Nonetheless, Masters was described by the UK newspaper [[The Guardian newspaper|''The Guardian'']] as "the woman who invented financial weapons of mass destruction". The paper later apologised for failing to give Masters an adequate opportunity to respond to their characterisation.<ref name="guardian1"/> She had told the newspaper: "I do believe CDS [credit default swaps] have been miscast, much as poor workmen tend to blame their tools." Masters explained to ''[[The Economist]]'', "Tools that transfer risk can also increase systemic risk if major counterparties fail to manage their exposures properly."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12552204 |title=Credit derivatives: The great untangling |work=The Economist | date=6 November 2008}}</ref> In April 2010 she told the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the [[European Parliament]] that "there are definitely lessons that have to be learnt. I for one feel that I have learnt from that experience and there are things I may like to have seen done differently". She stated support for reforms which increase transparency and reduce the risk of contagion among financial firms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=en&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20100426STO73416 |title=Derivatives: To understand risks better, transparency should be increased |publisher=European Parliament |date=28 April 2010}}</ref>

From 2001 to 2004, Masters served as the bank's head of Global Credit Portfolio and Credit Policy and Strategy. From 2004 to 2007, she was Chief Financial Officer of J.P. Morgan's Investment Bank. In 2007 she was named head of Global Commodities.<ref name="Linkedin" /> By 2014, J.P. Morgan had the largest revenues of any investment bank in commodities, according to United Kingdom analytics firm Coalition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/20/us-jp-morgan-commodities-coalition-idUSBREA2J1GR20140320 |title=JPMorgan named top commodities bank, day after selling physical business |author=David Sheppard  |date= 20 March 2014 |work=Reuters}}</ref> That same year, J.P. Morgan announced the sale of its physical commodities business for $3.5bn in the face of increased regulatory scrutiny brought on by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation into the bank’s alleged manipulation of energy markets in California and Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-19/jpmorgan-said-to-agree-on-sale-of-commodities-unit-to-mercuria.html  |title=JPMorgan Agrees to Sell Commodities Unit for $3.5 Billion |author=Andy Hoffman and Hugh Son |work=Bloomberg |date=19 March 2014}}</ref>  J.P. Morgan paid $410 million to settle the investigation without admitting wrongdoing. J.P. Morgan defended Masters, stating that "We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter". Masters left J.P. Morgan once she had completed the sale for the bank.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d7f2a4a6-b9b9-11e3-a3ef-00144feabdc0 |title=The female face of the crisis quits the spotlight | work=The Financial Times |author=GillianTett |date=3 April 2014}}</ref>
