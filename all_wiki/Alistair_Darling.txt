'''Alistair Maclean Darling, Baron Darling of Roulanish''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|PC}} (born 28 November 1953) is a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Labour Government 2007-2010|Labour Government from 2007 to 2010]] and as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]] until he stepped down in [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], most recently for [[Edinburgh South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South West]]. He was one of only three people to have served in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] continuously from Labour's landslide victory at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] until their defeat at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]; the other two were [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Jack Straw]].

Darling was first appointed as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] by Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in 1997, and was promoted to [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] in 1998. After spending four years at that department, he spent a further four years as [[Secretary of State for Transport]], while also becoming [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] in 2003. Blair moved Darling for a final time in 2006, making him [[President of the Board of Trade]] and [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]], before new Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] promoted Darling to replace himself as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 2007, a position he remained in until 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/09/alistair-darling-former-british-chancellor-joins-morgan-stanley-board|title=Alistair Darling, former British chancellor, joins Morgan Stanley board|last=Association|first=Press|date=2015-12-09|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909185355/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/09/alistair-darling-former-british-chancellor-joins-morgan-stanley-board|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

From 2012 to 2014, Darling was the chairman of the [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together Campaign]], a cross-party group that successfully campaigned for [[Scotland]] to remain part of the United Kingdom in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|2014 independence referendum]].<ref name="BBC25June">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18572750|title=Scottish independence: Darling launches Better Together campaign|date=24 June 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=25 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625004630/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18572750|archive-date=25 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> On 3 November 2014, Darling announced that he was standing down at the 2015 general election.<ref name="BBC03Nov">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-29873595|title=Alistair Darling to stand down as MP|date=3 November 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=4 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103080526/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-29873595|archive-date=3 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> He was nominated for a [[life peer]]age in the [[2015 Dissolution Honours]] and was created '''Baron Darling of [[Breacleit|Roulanish]]''', of [[Great Bernera]] in the County of [[Ross and Cromarty]], on 1 December 2015.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=61427 |date=4 December 2015 |page=23850 }}</ref> He retired from the House of Lords in July 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-28|title=Ex-chancellor Alistair Darling retires from House of Lords|url=https://news.stv.tv/politics/ex-chancellor-alistair-darling-retires-from-house-of-lords|access-date=2020-08-08|website=STV News|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Darling was a vocal advocate for the [[Britain Stronger in Europe|Remain]] campaign for the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU referendum on 23 June 2016]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/george-osborne-alistair-darling-unite-against-vote-leave|title=George Osborne and Alistair Darling unite against Vote Leave|last=Stewart|first=Heather|date=2016-06-01|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909185325/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/george-osborne-alistair-darling-unite-against-vote-leave|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Early life==
Alistair Darling was born in [[London]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/biography/0,,-1271,00.html |title=Darling, Alistair |work=The Guardian |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228101127/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/biography/0%2C%2C-1271%2C00.html |archive-date=28 December 2004 }}</ref> the son of a [[civil engineer]], Thomas, and his wife, Anna MacLean. He is the great-nephew of [[William Darling (politician)|Sir William Darling]], a Conservative/[[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]] Member of Parliament for [[Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South]] (1945–1957) who had served as [[Lord Provost of Edinburgh]] during the [[Second World War]]. He was educated at [[Chinthurst School]], in [[Tadworth]], [[Surrey]], then in [[Kirkcaldy]], and at the private [[Loretto School]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/some-former-pupils-show-the-way-1.324733 |title=Some former pupils show the way |work=The Herald |location=Glasgow |date=6 October 1998 |access-date=2 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603000651/http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/some-former-pupils-show-the-way-1.324733 |archive-date=3 June 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> in [[Musselburgh]]. He attended the [[University of Aberdeen]], from where he graduated as a [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB). He became the President of Aberdeen University [[Students' representative council|Students' Representative Council]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28857052|title=A brief history of Alistair Darling|last=Black|first=Andrew|date=2014-08-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909155059/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28857052|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Darling joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] aged 23, in 1977. He became a [[solicitor]] in 1978, then changed course for the [[Faculty of Advocates|Scots bar]] and was admitted as an advocate in 1984. In 1982 he was elected to the [[Lothian|Lothian Regional Council]], where he supported large [[Rates (tax)|rates]] rises in defiance of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s rate-capping laws, and even threatened not to set a rate at all.<ref name="privateeye1218">p5, ''[[Private Eye]]'' no. 1218, 5–18 September 2008</ref> He served on the council until he was elected to the [[House of Commons]]. He was also a board member for the [[Lothian and Borders Police]] and became a governor of [[Edinburgh Napier University|Napier College]] in 1985, until his election as an MP two years later.

==Member of Parliament==
He first entered Parliament at the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] in [[Edinburgh Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Central]], defeating the incumbent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, Sir [[Alexander MacPherson Fletcher|Alexander Fletcher]], by 2,262 votes; and remained an Edinburgh MP until he stood down in 2015.

After the creation of the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]], the number of Scottish seats at Westminster was reduced, and the Edinburgh Central constituency he represented was abolished. After the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] he represented the [[Edinburgh South West]] constituency. The Labour Party was so concerned that Darling might be defeated, that several senior party figures, including Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]] and Chancellor [[Gordon Brown]], made encouragement trips to the constituency during the campaign. Despite being a senior [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] Minister, Darling was hardly seen outside the area, as he was making the maximum effort to win his seat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1555903/Whos-who-in-Browns-Cabinet.html|title=Who's who in Brown's Cabinet|date=2007-06-27|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909150630/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1555903/Whos-who-in-Browns-Cabinet.html|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In the event, he won it with a majority of 7,242 over the second-placed [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate, a 16.49% margin on a 65.4% turnout.

===Shadow Cabinet===
As a [[backbencher]] he sponsored the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880042_en_1.htm|title=Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1988 (c. 42)|access-date=4 December 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226210132/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880042_en_1.htm|archive-date=26 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> He soon became an Opposition [[Home Office|Home Affairs]] spokesman in 1988 on the front bench of [[Neil Kinnock]].

After the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], he became a spokesman on [[HM Treasury|Treasury Affairs]], but was promoted to [[Shadow Cabinet of Tony Blair|Tony Blair's Shadow Cabinet]] as the [[Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] in 1996.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/11608371/Tony-Blairs-1997-Cabinet-Where-are-they-now.html|title=Tony Blair's 1997 Cabinet: Where are they now?|date=2015-05-19|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909185001/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/11608371/Tony-Blairs-1997-Cabinet-Where-are-they-now.html|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-14779262|title=Profile: Alistair Darling|date=2011-09-04|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909155055/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-14779262|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==In government==
Following the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], he entered Cabinet as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. In 1998, he was appointed [[Secretary of State for Social Security]], replacing [[Harriet Harman]] who had been dismissed. After the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], the [[Department of Social Security (United Kingdom)|Department of Social Security]] was abolished and replaced with the new [[Department for Work and Pensions]], which also took employment away from the education portfolio. Darling fronted the new department until 2002 when he was moved to the [[Department for Transport]], after his predecessor [[Stephen Byers]] resigned.

===Secretary of State for Transport===
Darling was given a brief to "take the department out of the headlines". He oversaw the creation of [[Network Rail]], the successor to [[Railtrack]], which had collapsed in controversial circumstances for which his predecessor was largely blamed. He also procured the passage of the legislation – the [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]] – which abolished the [[Rail Regulator]] and replaced him with the [[Office of Rail Regulation]]. He was responsible for the [[Railways Act 2005]] which abolished the [[Strategic Rail Authority]], a creation of the Labour government under the [[Transport Act 2000]]. Darling was also responsible for the cancellation of several major [[Light rail|Light Rail]] schemes, including a major extension to [[Manchester Metrolink]]<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3910235.stm |title=Government scraps trams extension |date=20 July 2004 |work=BBC News |access-date=29 October 2014}}</ref> (later reversed) and the proposed [[Leeds Supertram]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4403788.stm |title=Tram refusal a slap in the face |date=3 November 2005 |work=BBC News |access-date=29 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224173220/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4403788.stm |archive-date=24 December 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> citing rising costs of £620{{nbsp}}million and £486M respectively.

Darling gave the government's support to the [[Crossrail]] scheme for an east–west rail line under London,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3910091.stm |title=Government backs 10bn Crossrail |date=20 July 2004 |work=BBC News |access-date=29 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902234428/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3910091.stm |archive-date=2 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> whose £10 billion projected cost later rose to £15bn.

Although he was not at the Department for Transport at the time of the collapse of Railtrack, Darling vigorously defended what had been done in a speech to the House of Commons on 24 October 2005. This included threats that had been made to the independent Rail Regulator that if he intervened to defend the company against the government's attempts to force it into railway administration – a special status for insolvent railway companies – the government would introduce emergency legislation to take the regulator under direct political control. This stance by Darling surprised many observers, because during his tenure at the Department for Transport, he had made several statements to Parliament and the financial markets assuring them that the government regarded independence in economic regulation of the railways as essential.

===Secretary of State for Scotland===
In 2003, when the [[Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland|Scotland Office]] was folded into the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], he was appointed [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Scottish Secretary]] in combination with his Transport portfolio.

===Secretary of State for Trade and Industry===
In the [[Cabinet reshuffle]] of May 2006, he was moved to be [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]; [[Douglas Alexander]] replaced him as both [[Secretary of State for Transport]] and [[Secretary |Secretary of State for Scotland]]. On 10 November 2006 in a mini-reshuffle, [[Malcolm Wicks]], the Minister for Energy at the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], and thus one of Darling's junior ministers, was appointed Minister for Science. Darling took over day-to-day control of the Energy portfolio.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===

In June 2007, the new [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] appointed Darling [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], a promotion widely anticipated in the media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/alancochrane/8734993/The-truth-behind-Alistair-Darlings-attack-on-Gordon-Brown.html|title=The truth behind Alistair Darling's attack on Gordon Brown|last=Cochrane|first=Alan|date=2011-09-01|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909150514/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/alancochrane/8734993/The-truth-behind-Alistair-Darlings-attack-on-Gordon-Brown.html|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Journalists observed that three of Darling's four junior ministers at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] ([[Angela Eagle]], [[Jane Kennedy (politician)|Jane Kennedy]] and [[Kitty Ussher]]) were female and dubbed his team, "Darling's Darlings".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jul/13/politicalcolumnists.politics|title=Simon Hoggart's sketch: Darling, you're so dreary|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=13 July 2007|access-date=25 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913011721/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jul/13/politicalcolumnists.politics|archive-date=13 September 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2007, for the first time since 1860, there was a [[bank run|run]] on a British bank, [[Northern Rock]]. Although the [[Bank of England]] and the [[Financial Services Authority]] have jurisdiction in such cases, ultimate authority for deciding on financial support for a bank in exceptional circumstances rests with the Chancellor. The [[Subprime mortgage crisis|2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]] had caused a liquidity crisis in the UK banking industry, and Northern Rock was unable to borrow as required by its business model. Darling authorised the Bank of England to lend Northern Rock funds to cover its liabilities and provided an unqualified taxpayers' guarantee of the deposits of savers in Northern Rock to try to stop the run. Northern Rock borrowed up to £20bn from the Bank of England,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7063184.stm | title=US private equity firm eyes Rock | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2007 | access-date=1 January 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902235222/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7063184.stm | archive-date=2 September 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> and Darling was criticised for becoming sucked into a position where so much public money was tied up in a private company.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7112830.stm | title=Northern Rock & Virgin: who wins? | work=BBC News | date=26 November 2007 | access-date=1 January 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128115140/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7112830.stm | archive-date=28 November 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/39199b78-6489-11dc-90ea-0000779fd2ac|title=UK to guarantee Northern Rock deposits|date=2007-09-16|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909150645/https://www.ft.com/content/39199b78-6489-11dc-90ea-0000779fd2ac|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/18/northernrock.banking3|title=Darling under fire as Northern Rock is nationalised|last=Inman|first=Phillip|last2=Elliott|first2=Larry|date=2008-02-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09|last3=Hencke|first3=David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105090546/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/18/northernrock.banking3|archive-date=5 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 2008, Darling's Budget was criticised in a media campaign spread by a social networking site. Amid anger at the rise in alcohol duties, James Hughes, a landlord in [[Edinburgh]] (where Darling's constituency was based) symbolically barred Darling from his pub, and a passing reporter from the [[Edinburgh Evening News]] ran the story. A [[Facebook]] group was created, leading dozens of pubs across Britain to follow Hughes, barring Darling from their pubs. The story was eventually picked up by most national press and broadcast media in Britain, and [[David Cameron]], Leader of the Opposition at the time, cited the movement at Prime Minister's Questions on 26 March.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/1582825/%27Ban-Alistair-Darling-from-every-British-pub%27.html | title=Ban Alistair Darling from every British pub | work=The Telegraph | location=London | first=Christopher | last=Hope | date=26 March 2008 | access-date=3 April 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620180251/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/1582825/%27Ban-Alistair-Darling-from-every-British-pub%27.html | archive-date=20 June 2008 | url-status=live }} and{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/26/alistairdarling | title=You're barred, pub campaigners tell chancellor | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Angela | last=Balakrishnan | date=26 March 2008 | access-date=25 March 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813065043/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/26/alistairdarling | archive-date=13 August 2014 | url-status=live }} and{{cite web|url=http://www.stv.tv/content/news/headlines/display.html?id=opencms:/news/Campaign_launched_to_ban_the_Chancellor__2008032|title=Campaign launched to ban the Chancellor from every pub in the countryLatest Scottish news and headlines from Scotland|publisher=stv.tv}}{{dead link|date=August 2014 }}</ref>

====Child benefit data scandal====
{{main|Loss of United Kingdom child benefit data (2007)}}
Darling was Chancellor when the confidential personal details of over 25{{nbsp}}million British citizens went missing while being sent from his department to the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]].

====Storm warning====

And I think it's going to be more profound and long-lasting than people thought." His blunt warning led to confusion within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. However, Darling insisted that it was his duty to be "straight" with people.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4641381.ece | title=Labour in turmoil over Alistair Darling gaffe | work=The Times | location=London | date=31 August 2008 | access-date=25 March 2010 | first1=Isabel | last1=Oakeshott | first2=David | last2=Smith | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716151408/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4641381.ece | archive-date=16 July 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In October 2008 the government bailed out the Royal Bank of Scotland as part of the [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|2008 bank rescue package]]; Darling said in 2018 that the country was hours away from a breakdown of law and order if the bank had not been bailed out.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/104295018/britain-was-hours-from-breakdown-of-law-and-order-during-gfc-exchancellor |title= Britain was hours from breakdown of law and order during GFC: Ex-chancellor |publisher= Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 29 May 2018 |access-date= 2 June 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181121111547/https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/104295018/britain-was-hours-from-breakdown-of-law-and-order-during-gfc-exchancellor |archive-date= 21 November 2018 |url-status= live }}</ref>

===Budget 2008===
On 12 March 2008, Darling gave his first [[2008 United Kingdom budget|budget]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

====10% income tax band====
Darling's predecessor, [[Gordon Brown]], just before he became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], had abolished the 10% starting rate on [[income tax]] and reduced the basic rate of income tax from 22% to 20% in his final budget on 21 March 2007; this was to come into effect in the tax year starting 6 April 2008. This was not amended in Darling's 2008 budget. Although the majority of taxpayers would be marginally better off as a result of these changes, around 5,100,000 low earners (including those earning less than £18,000 annually) would have been worse off. On 18 October 2007, the Treasury released statistics which established that childless people on low incomes could lose up to £200 a year as a result of the changes, while parents and those earning more than £20,000 would gain money.

Increasing political backlash about the additional tax burden for some put immense pressure onto the government; including Darling with Gordon Brown facing criticism from his own Parliamentary Labour Party.
In May 2008 Darling announced he would help low-paid workers hit by the scrapping of the 10p rate, by raising that year's personal tax allowance by £600 funded by borrowing an extra £2.7bn.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3927280.ece | title=Gordon Brown pays £2.7&nbsp;billion to end 10p tax crisis | work=The Times | location=London | date=14 May 2008 | access-date=25 March 2010 | first=Philip | last=Webster | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508060714/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3927280.ece | archive-date=8 May 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref>

====Stimulus spending====
To boost falling demand, the government announced an additional £20bn spending package. Subsequently, [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]], governor of the Bank of England, warned the government against further stimulus spending, due to insecure public finances.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/24/bankofenglandgovernor-banking Britain cannot afford any further fiscal stimulus, King warns] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305012638/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/24/bankofenglandgovernor-banking |date=5 March 2017 }} Kathryn Hopkins,
''The Guardian'', Tuesday 24 March 2009 15.33 GMT.</ref>

===Budget 2009===
On 22 April 2009, Darling delivered his [[2009 United Kingdom budget|second budget]] speech in the House of Commons. To stimulate the motor industry, a £2,000 allowance was announced for a car more than 10 years old, if it was traded in for a new car. A 50% tax band was announced for earners of over £150,000 to start the following tax year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8011882.stm |title=At-a-glance: Budget 2009 |publisher=BBC |date=22 April 2009 |access-date=1 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425061209/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8011882.stm |archive-date=25 April 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Darling also announced that [[Personal allowance]] would be [[Personal allowance#Personal allowance tapering|tapered down]] by £1 for every £2 earned above £100,000 until it reached zero. This resulted in an anomalous effective marginal tax rate of 60% above £100,000, with the marginal tax rate returning to 40% for incomes above £112,950.

===Budget 2010===
[[Gordon Brown]] confirmed on 10 March 2010 that Alistair Darling would deliver his [[March 2010 United Kingdom budget|Third budget]] before the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|general election]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8558821.stm |title=Gordon Brown warns economic storm not over |work=BBC News |date=10 March 2010 |access-date=14 July 2010}}</ref> which was delivered on 24 March 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_daily_politics/8585164.stm?ls|title=Chancellor Alistair Darling opens the Budget|date=24 March 2010|publisher=British Broadcasting Company|access-date=24 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829133557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_daily_politics/8585164.stm?ls|archive-date=29 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Later activities==
Following the defeat of the Labour Party at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Darling announced that he intended to leave frontbench politics. On 17 May 2010, it was reported that he stated: "It has been an honour and a tremendous privilege but I believe it is time for me to return to the backbenches from where I shall look after, with great pride, the constituents of Edinburgh South West."<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7129175.ece "Darling leaves frontbench politics after more than 20 years", Times Online, 17 May 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716151359/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7129175.ece |date=16 July 2011 }}</ref>

Darling suggested on 7 September 2010 on ''[[The Daily Politics]]'' show that he was only intending to take a "year out" and may possibly reconsider his future.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11216887 | work=BBC News | title=Ex-Chancellor Alistair Darling: 'I am taking a year out' | date=7 September 2010 | access-date=20 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106015013/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11216887 | archive-date=6 January 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>

===Expenses claims===
In May 2009, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that Darling changed the designation of his second home four times in four years, allowing him to claim for the costs of his family home in Edinburgh, and to buy and furnish a flat in London including the cost of [[stamp duty]] and other legal fees. Darling said that "the claims were made within House of Commons rules".<ref name=bbckeydetails>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8039273.stm |title=MPs' expenses claims – key details |work=BBC News |access-date=13 May 2009 | date=19 June 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511161834/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8039273.stm| archive-date= 11 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Watt |first=Holly |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5293500/Alistair-Darlings-stamp-duty-paid-by-public-MPs-expenses.html |title=Daily Telegraph: Alistair Darling |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=8 May 2009 |access-date=13 May 2009 | location=London| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511055441/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5293500/Alistair-Darlings-stamp-duty-paid-by-public-MPs-expenses.html| archive-date= 11 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

[[Nick Clegg]], Leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], criticised him by saying: "given that very unique responsibility that [Darling] has [as Chancellor], it's simply impossible for him to continue in that role when such very major question marks are being raised about his financial affairs". A former Chairman and treasurer of the [[Scottish Labour|Scottish Labour Party]] described Darling's position as "untenable" and said that "[Darling] certainly shouldn't be in the Cabinet".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5418493/MPs-expenses-Alistair-Darling-billed-us-for-two-homes-at-the-same-time.html|title=MPs' expenses: Alistair Darling billed us for two homes at the same time|date=13 May 2009|access-date=3 April 2013|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first1=Robert|last1=Winnett|first2=Holly|last2=Watt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111193152/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5418493/MPs-expenses-Alistair-Darling-billed-us-for-two-homes-at-the-same-time.html|archive-date=11 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 1 June 2009, Darling apologised "unreservedly" about a mistaken claim for £700, which he had agreed to repay. He was supported by the Prime Minister, who referred to the incident as an inadvertent mistake.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8077916.stm|title=Darling 'very sorry' over claim|publisher=BBC|access-date=1 June 2009 | date=1 June 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090605161735/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8077916.stm| archive-date= 5 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In 2010, he resigned from the [[Faculty of Advocates]] as they were investigating a complaint about his expenses claims, Darling denied any connection between the two events.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/6968208/Alistair-Darling-resigns-from-law-body-as-it-investigates-his-conduct.html|title=Alistair Darling resigns from law body as it investigates his conduct – Telegraph|date=11 January 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=14 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219002739/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/6968208/Alistair-Darling-resigns-from-law-body-as-it-investigates-his-conduct.html|archive-date=19 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Better Together campaign===
Darling was the Chairman and one of the directors of the [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] campaign, which campaigned for a "No" vote in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|2014 referendum on Scottish independence]]. He was involved in the campaign's launch in June 2012, delivered a speech on the subject in the annual [[John Mackintosh (Scottish politician)|John P Mackintosh]] lecture in November 2012, and addressed a fringe meeting at the Scottish Conservative Conference in June 2013.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22810871 Scottish Tory Party conference: Labour's Darling delivers pro-Union message] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202101124/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22810871 |date=2 December 2017 }} bbc.co.uk, 8 June 2013</ref> In August 2014, Darling took part in ''[[Salmond & Darling: The Debate]]'' and ''[[Scotland Decides: Salmond versus Darling]]'', televised debates with [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] on the pros and cons of Scottish Independence.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/05/alex-salmond-alistair-darling-scotland-debate-independence |title=Scottish debate: Salmond and Darling in angry clash over independence |newspaper=The Guardian |date=5 August 2014 |access-date=10 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227012418/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/05/alex-salmond-alistair-darling-scotland-debate-independence |archive-date=27 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Darling was criticised by some Scottish Labour MPs and supporters who believed that working with Conservatives on the Better Together campaign might damage Labour's prospects in Scotland.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/labour-figures-shun-better-together-over-tory-role-1-2985642 |title=Labour figures shun Better Together over Tory role – Top stories |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2 July 2013 |access-date=26 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925134744/http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/labour-figures-shun-better-together-over-tory-role-1-2985642 |archive-date=25 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election a year after the referendum]], Labour [[List of MPs who lost their seat in the United Kingdom general election, 2015|lost all but one of their seats in Scotland]] to the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], with swings of over 30% in several seats, including a UK record swing of 39.3% against Labour in [[Glasgow North East]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|title = Election 2015: SNP wins 56 of 59 seats in Scots landslide'|date = 8 May 2015|access-date = 25 August 2015|website = [[BBC News]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150521003643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|archive-date = 21 May 2015|url-status = live}}</ref>
