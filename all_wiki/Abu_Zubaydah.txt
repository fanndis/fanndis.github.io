He is held under the authority of [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] (AUMF).

Zubaydah was captured in [[Pakistan]] in March 2002 and has been in United States custody ever since, including four-and-a-half years in the [[Black site|secret prison network]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). He was transferred among prisons in various countries including a year in [[Poland]], as part of a United States' [[extraordinary rendition]] program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5322694.stm |title=Americas &#124; Profile: Key US terror suspects |work=BBC News |date=February 11, 2008 |access-date=April 4, 2012}}</ref> During his time in CIA custody, Zubaydah was extensively interrogated; he was [[waterboarding|water-boarded]] 83 times<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/20detain.html|title=Waterboarding Used 266 Times on 2 Suspects|first=Scott|last=Shane|date=April 19, 2009|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> and subjected to numerous other [[torture]] techniques including [[Nudity#Imposed nudity|forced nudity]], [[sleep deprivation]], confinement in small dark boxes, deprivation of solid food, [[stress position]]s, and physical assaults.<ref name="vox.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/12/9/7360823/cia-torture-roundup|title=16 absolutely outrageous abuses detailed in the CIA torture report|work=Vox}}</ref> Videotapes of some of Zubaydah's interrogations are amongst those [[2005 CIA interrogation tapes destruction|destroyed by the CIA in 2005]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/TheLaw/story?id=4244423&page=1 |title=CIA Chief: We Waterboarded | publisher=ABC News |date=February 5, 2008 |access-date=April 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2010/03/15/abu-zubaydahs-torture-diary/ |title=Abu Zubaydah's Torture Diary |publisher=Andy Worthington |access-date=April 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/3/30/headlines |title=Headlines for March 30, 2009 |publisher=Democracy Now! |date=March 30, 2009 |access-date=April 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/do-cia-cables-show-doctors-monitoring-torture-528 |title=Do CIA Cables Show Doctors Monitoring Torture? |publisher=ProPublica |date=May 28, 2009 |access-date=April 4, 2012}}</ref>

Zubaydah and ten other "high-value detainees" were transferred to Guantanamo in September 2006. He and other former CIA detainees are held in [[Camp seven (Guantanamo)#Camp seven/Camp Platinum|Camp 7]], where conditions are the most isolating. At his [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] in 2007, Zubaydah said he was told that the CIA realized he was not significant.<ref name="FinnTate"/>

On July 24, 2014, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ordered the Polish government to pay Zubaydah [[euro|€100,000]] in damages. It also awarded him €30,000 to cover his costs. [[Poland]] cooperated with the US, allowing the CIA to hold and torture Zubaydah on its territory in 2002–2003. Zubaydah said through his US lawyer that he would be donating the full €100,000 in damages to victims of torture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/european-court-rejects-polish-appeal-cia-jail-case-183203445.html|title=European court rejects Polish appeal in CIA jail case|website=news.yahoo.com}}</ref> [[Joseph Margulies (lawyer)|Joseph Margulies]] was a lawyer for Zubaydah.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/secrets-politics-and-torture/transcript/|title=Secrets, Politics and Torture - Transcript|website=FRONTLINE}}</ref>

During the raid, Zubaydah was shot in the thigh, the testicle, and the stomach with rounds from an AK-47 assault rifle.<ref name="mayer"/><ref name="GuantanamoFiles"/> Not recognized at first, he was piled into a [[pickup truck]] along with other prisoners by the Pakistani forces, until a senior CIA officer identified him. He was taken by the Pakistanis to a Pakistani hospital nearby and treated for his wounds. The attending doctor told the CIA lead officer of the group which apprehended Zubaydah, that he had never before seen a patient survive such severe wounds.  The CIA flew in a doctor from [[Johns Hopkins University]] to ensure Zubaydah would survive during transit out of Pakistan.<ref name=nyt22June2008>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/washington/22ksm.html?pagewanted=all | title=Inside a 9/11 Mastermind's Interrogation | newspaper=New York Times | first=Scott | last=Shane | date=June 22, 2008 | access-date=2012-01-24}}</ref>

His [[pocket litter]] supposedly contained two [[ATM card|bank cards]] which showed that he had access to Saudi and Kuwaiti bank accounts; most al-Qaeda members used the preferred, untraceable [[hawala]] banking.<ref name="risen">Risen, James. ''State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration,'' 2006</ref> According to [[James Risen]]: "It is not clear whether an investigation of the cards simply fell through the cracks, or whether they were ignored because no one wanted to know the answers about connections between al Qaeda and important figures in the Middle East – particularly in Saudi Arabia."<ref name="risen"/> One of Risen's sources chalks up the failure to investigate the cards to incompetence rather than foul play: "The cards were sent back to Washington and were never fully exploited. I think nobody ever looked at them because of incompetence."<ref name="risen"/>

When Americans investigated the cards, Risen wrote that they worked with <blockquote>"a Muslim financier with a questionable past, and with connections to the Afghan Taliban, al Qaeda, and Saudi intelligence. ... Saudi intelligence officials had seized all of the records related to the card from the Saudi financial institution in question; the records then disappeared. There was no longer any way to trace the money that had gone into the account."<ref name="risen"/></blockquote>

A search of the safehouse turned up Zubaydah's personal 10,000-page diaries, in which he recorded his thoughts as a young boy, old man, and at his current age. What appears to be split personalities is how Zubaydah was piecing his memories together after his 1992 shrapnel head wound. As part of his therapy to regain his memories, he began recording the diary that detailed his life, emotions, and what people were telling him. He split information into categories, such as what he knew about himself and what people told him, and listed them under different names to distinguish one set from the other. This was later incorrectly interpreted by some analysts reviewing the diary as symptoms of split [[personality disorder]].<ref name="mayer"/><ref name=BlackBanners>{{cite book|last=Soufan|first=Ali|title=The Black Banners}}</ref>

=== Torture drawings ===
In December 2019, the New York Times published an article in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting which was based upon drawings made by Zubaydah, showing how he was tortured in "vivid and disturbing ways." The article includes some of the drawings as well as a link to a 61 page report titled "How America Tortures,"<ref>{{cite document|title=How America Tortures|ssrn = 3494533}}</ref> and asserts that Zubaydah was never a member of Al Qaeda. In the article Zubaydah gives gruesome details of numerous types of torture including being locked up inside a small box called “the dog box” for “countless hours,” which caused muscle contractions. “The very strong pain,” he said, “made me scream unconsciously.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/politics/cia-torture-drawings.html|title=CIA torture drawings}}</ref>

== Interrogation of Zubaydah ==
{{Main|Interrogation of Abu Zubaydah}}
Zubaydah was interrogated by two separate interrogation teams: the first from the [[FBI]] and one from the [[CIA]]. [[Ali Soufan]], one of the FBI interrogators, later testified in 2009 on these issues to the Senate Committee that was investigating detainee treatment.<ref name="SoufanOpEd"/> Soufan, who witnessed part of the CIA interrogation of Zubaydah, described his treatment under the CIA as [[torture]].<ref name="SoufanOpEd">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html Ali Soufan, "My Tortured Decision"], ''New York Times'', April 22, 2009</ref> The International Committee of the Red Cross and others later reached the same conclusion.<ref name="SoufanNewsweek">Michael Isikoff [http://www.newsweek.com/id/195089 "We Could Have Done This the Right Way"], ''Newsweek,'' April 25, 2009</ref><ref name="SoufanTestimony">[http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3842&wit_id=7906 "Congressional Testimony of Ali Soufan, May 13, 2009"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715191704/http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3842&wit_id=7906 |date=July 15, 2009 }}, Congressional Testimony, May 13, 2009</ref><ref name="ICRC">[http://www.nybooks.com/icrc-report.pdf ''Report on the Treatment of Fourteen "High Value Detainees" in CIA Custody''], International Committee of the Red Cross, February 2007</ref> While in CIA custody, Zubaydah lost his left eye.<ref name="vox.com"/>

Because of the urgency felt about the interrogation of Zubaydah, the CIA had consulted with the president about how to proceed. The General Counsel of the CIA asked for a legal opinion from the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], Department of Justice about what was permissible during interrogation.

== 2003 transfer to Guantanamo ==
In August 2010, the Associated Press reported that the CIA, having concluded its agents had gotten most of the information from Zubaydah, in September 2003 transferred him and three other high-value detainees to Guantanamo. They were held at what was informally known as "[[Strawberry Fields (Guantanamo)|Strawberry Fields]]," a secret camp within the complex built especially for former CIA detainees. Concerned that a pending Supreme Court decision, ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' (2004), might go against the Bush administration and require providing the prisoners with counsel and having to reveal data about them, on March 27, 2004, the CIA took the four men back into custody and transported them out of Guantanamo to one of their secret sites.<ref name="AssociatedPress-2010-08-07">

In February 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross concluded a report on the treatment of "14 high-value detainees," who had been held by the CIA and, after September 2006, by the military at Guantanamo.<ref name="ICRC"/> The ICRC described the twelve [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] covered in the OLC memos to the CIA: [[waterboarding|suffocation by water]] (which is described as "torture" by numerous US officials<ref name=mayer/><ref name="AmyGoodman">[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/7/18/the_dark_side_jane_mayer_on Amy Goodman, "'The Dark Side': Jane Mayer on the Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals, Interview Transcript"], ''Democracy Now,'' July 18, 2008</ref>), prolonged stress standing position, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold temperature, prolonged shackling, threats of ill-treatment, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food.<ref name="ICRC"/> Zubaydah was the only detainee of the 14 interviewed who had been subjected to all 12 of these interrogation techniques.<ref name="ICRC"/> He was also the only one of the 14 detainees to be put into close confinement.<ref name="ICRC"/>

== May 30, 2005, memo ==
The final memo mentioned Zubaydah several times. It claimed that due to the enhanced interrogation techniques, Zubaydah "provided significant information on two operatives, [including] José Padilla[,] who planned to build and detonate a '[[dirty bomb]]' in the Washington DC area."<ref name="May302005BradburyMemo"/> This claim is strongly disputed by Ali Soufan, the FBI interrogator who first interrogated Zubaydah following his capture, by traditional means. He said the most valuable information was gained before torture was used. Other intelligence officers have also disputed that claim.<ref name=mayer/><ref name="SoufanOpEd"/><ref name="SoufanNewsweek"/><ref name="SoufanTestimony"/><ref name="MazettiAndJohnston">[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/washington/09zubaydah.html?_r=1&ref=world&oref=slogin Mark Mazzetti and David Johnston ''Inquiry Begins Into Destruction of Tapes''].

<blockquote>This is not to say that the interrogation program has worked perfectly. According to the IG Report, the CIA, at least initially, could not always distinguish detainees who had information but were successfully resisting interrogation from those who did not actually have the information. See IG Report at 83–85. On at least one occasion, this may have resulted in what might be deemed in retrospect to have been the unnecessary use of enhanced techniques. On that occasion, although the on-scene interrogation team judged Zubaydah to be compliant, elements within CIA Headquarters still believed he was withholding information. See id at 84. At the direction of CIA Headquarters, interrogators therefore used the waterboard one more time on Zubaydah.<ref name="May302005BradburyMemo"/>
</blockquote>

[[John E. McLaughlin|John McLaughlin]], former acting CIA director, stated in 2006, "I totally disagree with the view that the capture of Zubaydah was unimportant. Zubaydah was woven through all of the intelligence prior to 9/11 that signaled a major attack was coming, and his capture yielded a great deal of important information."<ref name="SuskindBlitzer">[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/20/sitroom.02.html ''Transcript for THE SITUATION ROOM with Wolf Blitzer''] CNN, June 20, 2006</ref>

In his 2007 memoir, former [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA Director]] [[George Tenet]] writes:
<blockquote>A published report in 2006 contended that Zubaydah was mentally unstable and that the administration had overstated his importance. Baloney. Zubaydah had been at the crossroads of many al-Qa'ida operations and was in position to – and did – share critical information with his interrogators. Apparently, the source of the rumor that Zubaydah was unbalanced was his personal diary, in which he adopted various personas. From that shaky perch, some junior Freudians leapt to the conclusion that Zubaydah had multiple personalities. In fact, Agency psychiatrists eventually determined that in his diary he was using a sophisticated literary device to express himself. And, boy, did he express himself.<ref name="GeorgeTenet">George Tenet, ''At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA,'' HarperCollins, 2007</ref></blockquote>

== Intelligence obtained from Zubaydah and its aftereffects ==
Zubaydah's capture was touted as the biggest of the War on Terror until that of [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]].<ref name="9/11MastermindNabbed">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/02/terror/main542459.shtml ''Alleged 9-11 Mastermind Nabbed''] CBS News, March 1, 2003</ref> The director of the FBI stated Zubaydah's capture would help deter future attacks.<ref name="NewsSummary">[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/04/nyregion/news-summary-384283.html ''NEWS SUMMARY: Arrest May Deter Attacks'']. ''New York Times'', April 4, 2002</ref>

In a speech in 2006, President Bush claimed that Zubaydah revealed useful intelligence when enhanced interrogation was used, including identification of two important suspects and information that allegedly helped foil a terrorist attack on American soil.<ref name="Bush092006Speech"/> These claims directly conflict with the reports of the FBI agents who first interrogated Zubaydah. He gave them the names before torture was used, and the third piece of information came from other sources who had been receiving crucial pieces of information from him without the use of harsher techniques,<ref name=mayer/><ref name="SoufanOpEd"/><ref name="SoufanNewsweek"/> as well as other government officials.<ref name="FinnAndWarrick"/><ref name="NYTimesProfileZubaydah">[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/abu_zubaydah/index.html "Abu Zubaydah"], ''New York Times'', April 20, 2009</ref>

== Iraq War (2003) ==
The Bush administration relied on some of Zubaydah's claims in justifying the invasion of Iraq. U.S. officials stated that the allegations that Iraq and al-Qaeda were linked in the training of people on chemical weapons came from Zubaydah.<ref name="HutchesonAndKuhnhenn">[http://www2.jsonline.com/news/nat/sep02/83149.asp Ron Hutcheson and James Kuhnhenn, "Iraq deal with Congress nears, Bush says"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,'' September 26, 2002</ref><ref name="BushSaysIraq">[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7430560_ITM "Bush Says He and Congress Will Band Together on Iraq; Capitol Hill Still Sour"], ''Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News,'' September 27, 2002 (Access My Library Link, requires free membership)</ref><ref name="TorturedLie">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article6168270.ece][[Andrew Sullivan]]<span>, "One tortured lie: that's all it took for war"</span>, ''The Sunday Times,'' April 26, 2009</ref> The officials noted there was no independent verification of his claims.<ref name="HutchesonAndKuhnhenn"/><ref name="BushSaysIraq"/>

The U.S. government included statements made by Zubaydah in regards to al Qaeda's ability to obtain a dirty bomb to show a link between Iraq and al Qaeda.<ref name="FritzUmbach">[http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/04/13/document_dump/ Fritz Umbach, "Bush’s bogus document dump"], ''Salon,'' April 13, 2006</ref> According to a Senate Intelligence Committee report of 2004, Zubaydah said that "he had heard that an important al Qaeda associate, [[Abu Musab al Zarqawi]], and others had good relationships with Iraqi intelligence."<ref name="StephenHayes">[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/803czhfn.asp?pg=2 Stephen F.

In the Senate Armed Services Committee 2008 report on the abuses of detainees, the Bush administration was described as having applied pressure to interrogators to find a link between Iraq and al Qaeda prior to the Iraq War.<ref name="BanalityOfBush">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/opinion/26rich.html Frank Rich, "The Banality of Bush White House Evil"], ''The New York Times'', April 25, 2009</ref> Major Paul Burney, a psychiatrist with the United States Army, said to the committee, "while we were [at Guantanamo] a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between al Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful."<ref name="BanalityOfBush"/><ref name="ArmedServicesDetaineeReport">[http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf Senate Armed Services Committee, ''Inquiry Into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200942/http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |date=April 29, 2009 }}, Senate Armed Services Committee, November 20, 2008</ref> He said that higher-ups were "frustrated" and applied "more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results."<ref name="BanalityOfBush"/><ref name="ArmedServicesDetaineeReport"/><ref name="EdBrayton">[http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/05/the_lies_on_torture_just_keep.php Ed Brayton, "The Lies on Torture Just Keep Coming"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507071710/http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/05/the_lies_on_torture_just_keep.php |date=May 7, 2009 }}, ''Science'' Blogs, May 4, 2009</ref>

Colonel Lawrence B. Wilkerson, the former chief of staff for former Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] said:
<blockquote>Likewise, what I have learned is that as the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May 2002—well before the Justice Department had rendered any legal opinion—its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al-Qa'ida.

So furious was this effort that on one particular detainee, even when the interrogation team had reported to Cheney's office that their detainee "was compliant" (meaning the team recommended no more torture), the VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods. The detainee had not revealed any al-Qa'ida-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, "revealed" such contacts. Of course, later we learned that al-Libi revealed these contacts only to get the torture to stop.<ref name=ArmedServicesDetaineeReport/></blockquote>

== Concerns ==
In 2004, media coverage of Abu Zubaydah began listing him as a "disappeared" prisoner, claiming he had no access to the International Red Cross.<ref name="ReedBrody">[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/11/opinion/edbrody.php Reed Brody ''Prisoners who disappear'']. ''International Herald Tribune'', October 12, 2004</ref> In February 2005, the CIA was reported as uncomfortable keeping Zubaydah in indefinite custody.<ref name="JehlAndJohnstonAndLewis">Douglas Jehl, David Johnston, and Neil A.

After his transfer, the CIA denied access to Zubaydah. In 2008, the Office of the [[Inspector General]], Department of Justice, complained that it had been prevented from seeing him, although it was conducting a study of the US treatment of its detainees.<ref name="EmmaSchwartz">[https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/2008/05/20/justice-dept-inspector-general-claims-cia-hampered-its-investigation.html Emma Schwartz, "Justice Dept. Inspector General Claims CIA Hampered its Investigation"], ''U.S. News & World Report,'' May 20, 2008</ref>

== Zubaydah's mental health ==
Some people are concerned about Zubaydah's mental stability and how that has affected information he has given to interrogators. [[Ron Suskind]] noted in his book, ''[[The One Percent Doctrine]]: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11'' (2006), that Zubaydah was mentally ill or disabled due to a severe head injury. He described Zubaydah as keeping a diary "in the voice of three people: Hani 1, Hani 2, and Hani 3"—a boy, a young man and a middle-aged alter ego.<ref name="SuskindOnePercent"/> Zubaydah's diaries spanned ten years and recorded in numbing detail "what he ate, or wore, or trifling things [people] said."<ref name="EggenPincusFBICIADebate"/> Dan Coleman, then the FBI's top al-Qaeda analyst, told a senior bureau official, "This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality."<ref name="SuskindOnePercent"/> According to Suskind, this judgment was "echoed at the top of CIA and was briefed to the President and Vice President."<ref name="SuskindOnePercent"/> Coleman stated Zubaydah was a "safehouse keeper" with mental problems, who "claimed to know more about al-Qaeda and its inner workings than he really did."<ref name="EggenPincusFBICIADebate"/>

[[Joseph Margulies (lawyer)|Joseph Margulies]], Zubaydah's co-counsel, wrote in an op-ed in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'':
<blockquote>Partly as a result of injuries he suffered while he was fighting the communists in Afghanistan, partly as a result of how those injuries were exacerbated by the CIA and partly as a result of his extended isolation, Zubaydah's mental grasp is slipping away. Today, he suffers blinding headaches and has permanent brain damage. He has an excruciating sensitivity to sounds, hearing what others do not. The slightest noise drives him nearly insane. In the last two years alone, he has experienced about 200 seizures. Already, he cannot picture his mother's face or recall his father's name. Gradually, his past, like his future, eludes him.<ref name="MarguliesZubaydah">{{Cite news|last=Marguiles|first=Joseph|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-apr-30-oe-margulies30-story.html|title=The suffering of Abu Zubaydah|date=April 30, 2009|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190718060008/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-apr-30-oe-margulies30-story.html|archive-date=July 18, 2019|author-link=Joseph Margulies (lawyer)|url-access=limited}}</ref></blockquote>

== Legal status ==
President Bush referred to Zubaydah in a speech to Congress September 2006 requesting a bill to authorize [[military commissions]], following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006) that held the tribunals as formulated by the executive branch were unconstitutional.

He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system. That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the [[Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants|OARDEC]] reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back, a year later, the [[Joint Review Task Force]] classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request.<ref name=Unchargeable71>{{cite news

Zayn al-lbidin Muhammed Husayn was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge but too dangerous to release. Although Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a [[Periodic Review Board]], less than a quarter of men have received a review.

On 24 July 2014, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled that [[Poland]] had violated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] when it cooperated with US allowing the CIA to hold and torture Zubaydah and [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]] on its territory in 2002–2003.
