==Career==

=== Early career ===
During his sophomore year, Kushner was founding executive editor of ''Scene'', a new [[Brooks Brothers]]-sponsored student-publication that aimed to be "[[Harvard University|Harvard's]] version of ''Vogue'' and ''Vanity Fair''".<ref>{{cite web|title = DOORDROPPED: Which Scene? |work=The Harvard Crimson|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/12/7/doordropped-which-scene-the-stairwell-at/ |first=Leon |last=Neyfakh |date=December 7, 2005 |accessdate = January 2, 2016}}</ref> According to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', ''Scene'' "faced blistering criticism upon its release", with students going so far as creating a "''Scene'' Magazine is Bullshit" Facebook group criticizing it for its "completely ludicrous ... skewed portrayal of the Harvard community" and "lack of models who were minorities".<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title = Glossies Gear Up For Second Run {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/3/16/glossies-gear-up-for-second-run/|website = www.thecrimson.com|accessdate = January 2, 2016}}</ref>

In the spring of his junior year, with two graduate students he pooled $10,000 to found social network Vostu,<ref name="forbes.com">{{cite web|title = The 26-Year-Old VC Who Cashed In On Instagram|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2012/05/02/the-26-year-old-vc-who-cashed-out-in-instagram/|website = Forbes|accessdate = January 2, 2016}}</ref> which aimed to "fill a void left by online communities in which English is the lingua franca", like Facebook. According to Kushner, Latin America was a promising market for a Facebook-alternative and new social networking site because "[it was] a place where Internet use is increasing every year, and technology is booming at a rapid pace".<ref>{{cite news |title=Students Start Spanish Social Site |work=The Harvard Crimson|url = https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/3/7/students-start-spanish-social-site-facebook/ |first=Andrew M. |last=Benitez |date=March 7, 2007|accessdate = January 2, 2016}}</ref>

The year after graduation, he also co-founded a start-up called Unithrive, with the cousin of the president of [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] who was also a Harvard student. Unithrive was inspired by the peer-to-peer loan model of Kiva, but aimed to "ease the crisis in paying for college" by matching "alumni lenders to cash-strapped students ... who [could] post photographs and biographical information and request up to $2,000", interest-free for repayment within five years of graduation.<ref>{{Cite news|title = I'm Going to Harvard.
