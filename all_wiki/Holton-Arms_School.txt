== History ==
In 1901, Jessie Moon Holton and Carolyn Hough Arms founded Holton-Arms School. The school was located at 2125 S Street, NW, [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>Holton-Arms School, Bethesda, MD. [http://www.holton-arms.edu/page.cfm?p=8167 "Holton-Arms: School History."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927133301/http://www.holton-arms.edu/page.cfm?p=8167 |date=2013-09-27 }}. Accessed 2014-01-29.</ref>

Holton-Arms moved to Bethesda in 1963. Located on {{convert|57|acre|m2}} of rolling woodlands just off River Road, the campus has seven buildings. Its facilities include a science wing and lecture hall, two libraries, a performing arts center with a 400-seat theater and new black box theater, art and ceramic studios (with a kiln) and photo lab, three dance studios, a double gymnasium, an indoor competition-size pool, a weight and training room, and dining room renovated in 2012. Outdoor facilities include seven tennis courts, an eight-lane all-weather track, and three athletic fields, including a synthetic turf field.

The School's mission is to cultivate the unique potential of young women through the “education not only of the mind, but of the soul and spirit.” (Jessie Moon Holton, 1866–1951). The School’s motto is ''Inveniam viam aut faciam''—I will find a way or make one.<ref>{{cite web |title=Holton at a Glance |url=https://www.holton-arms.edu/about/holton-at-a-glance |website=Holton-Arms School |accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>
