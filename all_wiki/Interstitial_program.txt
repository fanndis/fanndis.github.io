In [[television programming]], an '''interstitial program''' (or '''wraparound program''' or '''wraparound segment''') refers to a short program that is often shown between [[film|movies]] or other events, e.g. cast interviews after movies on [[premium channel]]s.  The term can also refer to a narrative bridge between segments within a program, such as the live action introductions to the animated segments in the Disney films [[Fantasia (1940 film)|''Fantasia'']] and ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', or the [[Simpson family]]'s interludes during their annual ''[[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' episodes.

Sometimes, if a program finishes earlier than expected, a short extra program may be inserted in the schedule to fill the time until the next scheduled program is due to start. American cable channel [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] commonly aired ''[[TV's Bloopers & Practical Jokes]]'' after shorter-than-average [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] games.

For U.S. telecasts of the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' between 1959 and 1968, celebrity hosts appeared in wraparound segments.  Opening credits especially designed by the network were shown in CBS's own format, followed by the host's first appearance, in which he made comments (often humorous, though never derogatory) about the film. Immediately following this, and without a commercial pause, the film itself would begin with all of its original 1939 opening credits. Halfway through the picture, the host would reappear and introduce the second half of the film. When the film ended, however, its closing credits would not be shown in their original format. Instead, the host would appear once more, bid farewell to the viewing audience, and the closing credits would be shown in CBS's own format.

[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] used a variety of material as interstitials; often [[animation]], including [[Roger Mainwood]]'s video of [[Kraftwerk]]'s hit "[[Autobahn (song)|Autobahn]]", [[Halas and Batchelor]] shorts, and [[stop-motion]] [[Russian animation|Soviet cartoon]]s; also [[rhythmic gymnastics]] performances, [[instrumental music]], or sometimes simply a [[test card]].

[[Japan]]ese [[public broadcasting]] organization [[NHK]]'s ''[[Minna no Uta]]'' is something of a national institution, commissioning makers of usually [[animation|animated]] films and famous or upcoming music acts to collaborate on exclusive [[music video]]s used to plug schedule gaps in lieu of [[Television advertisement|advertisements]].

In Canada, short film series such as ''[[Canada Vignettes]]'' and ''[[Heritage Minutes]]'' were often used on [[CBC Television]] and other broadcasters.<ref name="Ohayon Nov 2011">{{cite web|last=Ohayon|first=Albert|title=Canada Vignettes: Essential Canadiana, eh!|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/2011/11/16/canada-vignettes-essential-canadiana-eh/|work=NFB blog|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref>
