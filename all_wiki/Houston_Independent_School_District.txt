Like most districts in Texas it is [[independent school district|independent]] of the city of Houston and all other municipal and county jurisdictions. The district has its headquarters in the Hattie Mae White Educational Support Center in Houston.

In 2016, the school district was rated "met standards" by the [[Texas Education Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/cgi/sas/broker?_service=marykay&year4=2016&year2=16&_debug=0&topic=src&gifname=g_src2012&sublevel=camp&single=N&batch=N&app=PUBLIC&title=2016+Accountability+Reports&_program=perfrept.perfmast.sas&ptype=P&level=district&search=cntyname&namenum=Harris&cntylist=101&district=101912&prgopt=2016%2Facct%2Frating_report.sas&subj=RE|title = 2016 Accountability Rating System|publisher = Texas Education Agency}}</ref>

Simultaneously [[Mexican Americans]] were being discriminated against when they were being labeled as whites and being put with only [[African Americans]] as part of HISD's desegregation / integration plan.  This kept both Mexican Americans and African Americans away from Anglos while satisfying integration requirements set forth by the 1954 [[Brown v. Board of Education]] court case decision.  Many Mexican Americans took their children out of the public schools and put them in "huelga," or protest schools.<ref>{{cite book|title=Subtractive Schooling: U.S. - Mexican Youth and the Politics of Caring - Angela Valenzuela - Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haOuu_tcc3kC&q=Many+Mexican+Americans+took+their+children+out+of+the+public+schools+and+put+them+in+%22huelga%2C%22+or+protest+schools&pg=PA46|accessdate=20 September 2015|isbn = 9781438422626|last1 = Valenzuela|first1 = Angela|date = 2010-03-31}}</ref> On August 31, 1970 and organized by the [[Mexican-American Education Council]] (MAEC), they began three weeks of boycotts, protests, and picketing.  This action lasted approximately three weeks, during which up to 75% of the student bodies of some high schools participated in the boycotts.  During the protests MAEC demanded twenty issues to be resolved and HISD began rezoning school areas within its jurisdiction in response.  However, this rezoning encouraged "white flight" since minorities were now entering "white schools" in large numbers.<ref>Angela Valenzuela ''Subtractive Schooling: U.S.-Mexican Youth and the Politics of Caring'' (New York: State University of New York Press, 1999) p. 39-49</ref> At first the district used [[desegregation busing in the United States|forced busing]], but later switched to a voluntary [[magnet school]] program in order to discourage "white flight".<ref name="Wrong3"/>

The district eventually integrated races in a semi-peaceful manner. River Oaks Elementary School became the first school to implement the HISD's Vanguard Program in the fall of 1972, with a program for 4th-6th graders. This program was initially named the Elementary School For The Gifted. The Vanguard Program name was adopted a year later.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} A [[desegregation busing]] plan, protested by Anglo White westside neighborhoods not wanting their children bused to predominately black schools, was rejected by the court system but [[white flight]] began by the 1970s.<ref name=Davison/>

Circa 1972, a group of citizens in western Houston tried to form Westheimer Independent School District out of a portion of Houston ISD.

HISD's magnet (Performing Arts, Science, Health Professions, Law Enforcement, etc.) high schools are{{who|date=November 2010}} considered a model for other urban school districts as a way to provide a high quality education and keep top performing students in the inner city from fleeing to [[private school]]s or [[exurb]]an school districts. Magnet schools are popular with parents and students that wish to escape low-performing schools and school violence. The members of the administration of schools losing students to higher-performing campuses, such as Bill Miller of [[Yates High School]], complained about the effects.<ref>"[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2005_3900502 Transfer policy hinders schools]," ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', September 4, 2005</ref>

There are 55 elementary magnet schools, 30 magnet middle schools, and 27 magnet high schools.  Some magnet schools are mixed comprehensive and magnet programs, while others are solidly magnet and do not admit any "neighborhood" students.

In April 1997 a lawsuit against HISD seeking to end race-based admissions to magnet schools was filed on behalf of two white applicants to [[Lanier Middle School (Houston)|Lanier Middle School]] who were denied admission because the quota for White students was filled. The lawsuit was funded by the group "Campaign for a Color-Blind America".<ref>Gore, p.

==Schools==
{{Main|List of Houston Independent School District schools}} 
In HISD grades [[kindergarten]] and grades 1 through 5 are considered to be elementary school, grades 6 through 8 are considered to be middle school, and grades 9 through 12 are considered to be high school. Some elementary schools go up to the sixth grade. Some districts have grades elementary grades K-3 and 4-6 and then junior high school grades 7-8 and then high school grades 9-12.

Every house in HISD is assigned to an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school. HISD has many alternative programs and transfer options available to students who want a specialized education and/or dislike their home schools.

===Characteristics of schools and White enrollment===
Donald McAdams wrote that in the 1990s, within trustee District 5 there were schools that were about 50% White that usually had ample parent support and stronger test scores while there were schools about 90% or higher minorities that had low test scores and little to no parent support.<ref name=McAdamsp59>McAdams, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4eY4cg07-CAC&pg=PA59&dq=%22Overall,+ethnic+enrollments+in+District+Five+were+almost%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xTt3UpX7GLLksATY_oDoBA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Overall%2C%20ethnic%20enrollments%20in%20District%20Five%20were%20almost%22&f=false 59].</ref> He explained that in Houston white parents sent children to HISD schools that had minority children as long as the minority children tended to be middle class and that there was not too many of them.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> Many black students who lived in District 5 were middle class children who took school buses to the schools and did not live in the school zones. According to McAdams their enrollment levels were stable and White parents were comfortable with their presence.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> He added that very poor black children tended to go to their neighborhood schools outside of District 5.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> McAdams also stated that White middle-class parents did not consider Asians and Asian Americans to be minorities who could make a school less attractive to them.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> In the 1980s and 1990s increased enrollment of poor, [[English as a second language|non-English speaking]] Central American students at some HISD neighborhood schools made them unattractive to White parents.<ref name=McAdamsp59/>

According to McAdams, the White middle class community accepted minority percentages of around 50% for elementary schools, and for middle and high schools the White community accepted minority percentages of over 70 because classes at those levels were separated by academic ability.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> If percentages of minorities exceeded the tolerable levels at a particular school, white parents withdrew their children from the said school until there were few White people left.<ref name=McAdamsp5960>McAdams, p.

McAdams argued that class was a far more important consideration than race to White parents.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> He stated that despite how "negative" his comments about White HISD residents sounded, many of the White parents were "not necessarily racists" but instead wanted high quality academic instruction in their schools, as methods and instructions for poor children were not suited for middle class children.<ref name=McAdamsp60>McAdams, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4eY4cg07-CAC&pg=PA60&dq=%22White+communities+would+support+schools+with+minority+enrollments+up+to+50%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YUx4UtDsF8nesASum4HoBw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22White%20communities%20would%20support%20schools%20with%20minority%20enrollments%20up%20to%2050%22&f=false 60].</ref> McAdams argued that the attitude of the White community being willing to send their children to schools with about 50% minority enrollment was more progressive than the previous White attitude around the 1960s which was hostile to any minority enrollment in White schools.<ref name=McAdamsp60/>

==Dress codes==
[[File:LamarWE.jpg|thumb|left|Students at many HISD high schools, including [[Lamar High School (Houston)|Lamar High School]] (pictured here), wear [[school uniforms]]]]

As of 2006, over twenty high schools require their students to wear [[school uniform]]s or "standardized dress." Of them, one, [[Lamar High School (Houston)|Lamar High School]], had a [[White American|White]] plurality.<!--Corrections state that it's not a majority, as was originally said--> Nine Houston ISD high schools did not require students to wear uniforms or standardized dress.

The design made it difficult for wheelchair-using individuals to navigate the building. The complex cost U.S.$6 million. The building had tropical indoor [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]]s, causing critics to criticize the spending priorities of the district. When the district considered cutting a popular [[kindergarten]] program for financial reasons, taxpayers voted many board members out of office. The district sold the former complex for $38 million to a company that demolished the site and developed a mixed-use commercial property; demolition began on September 14, 2006. Demolition crews destroyed the Will Rogers Elementary School, an adjacent school at 3101 Weslayan that closed in spring 2006.
