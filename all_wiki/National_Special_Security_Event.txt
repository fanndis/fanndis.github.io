A '''National Special Security Event''' ('''NSSE''') is an event of national or international significance deemed by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) to be a potential target for terrorism or other criminal activity.  These events have included summits of world leaders, meetings of international organizations, presidential nominating conventions and presidential inaugurations.  NSSE designation requires federal agencies to provide full cooperation and support to ensure the safety and security of those participating in or otherwise attending the event, and the community within which the event takes place, and is typically limited to specific event sites for a specified time frame.

An NSSE places the [[United States Secret Service]] as the lead agency in charge of the planning, coordination, and implementation of security operations for the event, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in charge of intelligence, counterterrorism, and investigation of major criminal activities associated with the event, and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] in charge of recovery management in the aftermath of terrorism, major criminal activities, natural disasters, or other catastrophic incidents following the event. Like the FBI and FEMA, the Secret Service brings in local law enforcement, public safety, and military experts to assist with developing the plan, and give them the special guidance and training to operate within the security plan.<ref name="fact2006"/> NSSE designation is not a funding mechanism, and currently there is no specific federal "pot of money" to be distributed to state and local governments within whose jurisdiction NSSEs take place.

==Authority==
NSSE procedures were established by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in a portion of [[PDD-62|Presidential Decision Directive 62]] in May 1998, which set out the security roles for federal agencies at major events.<ref>{{cite web

==Procedure==
A number of factors are taken into consideration when designating an event as a National Special Security Event.  [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] [[press releases]] usually cite the following factors:<ref name="fact2006">{{cite web

*'''Anticipated attendance by dignitaries'''. Events attended by officials of the United States government or foreign dignitaries may create an independent federal interest to ensure that the event transpires without incident and that sufficient resources are brought to bear in the event of an incident.
*'''Size of the event'''. A large number of attendees and participants generally increases security requirements.  In addition, larger events are more likely to draw the attention of terrorists or other criminals, particularly those interested in employing weapons of mass destruction.
*'''Significance of the event'''. Some events have historical, political, cultural, or other symbolic significance that may heighten concern about possible terrorist acts or other criminal activity.
*'''Duration of the event'''. State and local law enforcement and public safety agencies may possess the manpower and other resources to provide adequate security for a major event within their jurisdiction (e.g. World Series, NASCAR race, Super Bowl, televised awards show), but is unable to do so for events over several days or weeks and at the same time continue to meet routine obligations in the greater community.
*'''Availability of state and local resources'''.  When state and local jurisdictions lack the expertise, experience, manpower or other assets needed to ensure comprehensive protection of these major events of national or international significance.
*'''Multiplicity of Jurisdictions'''. Extensive coordination of law enforcement and public safety agencies from multiple jurisdictions.
*'''[[Threat assessment]]s'''. Anticipation of terrorism, or extensive illegal civil disobedience or other criminal activity.

Typical NSSE security measures include:

* Interagency coordination and interoperability
* Heavy police (days off and leaves may be canceled) and often [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] presence<ref name=Security>{{cite video|title=Paula Zahn Now|publisher=[[CNN]] |date=June 8, 2004|medium=television}}</ref>
* [[Police dogs]] for bomb detection<ref name="fact2006"/>
* [[Closed-circuit television|Surveillance]]
* [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] detection, mitigation, and decontamination
* [[Sharpshooter]]s and other tactical capabilities
* Flight restrictions around the area<ref name=Security/>
* [[United States Coast Guard]] patrols<ref name=Security/>
* Increased railroad security<ref name=Security/>
* Extensive road closures<ref name="fact2006"/><ref name=Security/>
* When applicable members of the [[Chemical_Biological_Incident_Response_Force|Chemical Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF)]] are deployed

The [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] notes that since the "Presidential Protection Act of 2000 became public law...the Secret Service is authorized to participate in the planning, coordination and implementation of security operations at special events of national significance....[and that] when an event is designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security as a National Special Security Event (NSSE), the Secret Service assumes its mandated role as the lead agency for the design and implementation of the operational security plan...The goal of the cooperating agencies is to provide a safe and secure environment for Secret Service protectees, other dignitaries, the event participants and the general public. There is a tremendous amount of advance planning and coordination in preparation for these events."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.secretservice.gov/nsse.shtml| title = National Special Security Events| publisher = [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]| accessdate = 2013-06-26| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130328121305/http://www.secretservice.gov/nsse.shtml| archive-date = 2013-03-28| url-status = dead}}</ref>

==Events==
{{USC|18|3056}} paragraph (e)(2) requires that, at the end of each federal [[fiscal year]], the [[executive branch]] report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] which events were designated NSSEs, and what criteria were used to make the designations.

Typical types of NSSEs are [[state funeral]]s, major [[political convention]]s, the [[Academy Awards|Academy]] and [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] awards, major sporting events (e.g., the [[Olympic Games]] and the [[Super Bowl]]), and the [[State of the Union]] addresses.<ref name="fact2008">{{cite web | url= http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop09028/chap_6.htm| title = Planned Special Events: Cost Management and Cost Recovery Primer | publisher = [[Federal Highway Administration]]| date = October 2010 | accessdate = 2013-06-26 }}</ref> The table below lists some NSSEs since enactment of the relevant statute.
