[[PepsiCo]] purchased Taco Bell in 1978, and later [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands.

== History ==
[[File:Glen Bell.jpg|left|thumb|Glen Bell, the founder of Taco Bell]]
Taco Bell was founded by [[Glen Bell]], an entrepreneur who first opened a hot dog stand called Bell's Drive-In in [[San Bernardino, California]] in 1948. Bell watched long lines of customers at a Mexican restaurant called the Mitla Cafe, located across the street, which became famous among residents for its hard-shelled tacos. Bell attempted to reverse-engineer the recipe, and eventually the owners allowed him to see how the tacos were made. He took what he had learned and opened a new [[Taco stand|stand]] in 1951. The name underwent several changes, from Taco-Tia through El Taco, before settling on Taco Bell.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/dining/north-of-the-border-its-everyones-mexican-food.html</ref>

Glen Bell opened the first Taco Bell in 1962 in [[Downey, California]].<ref name=company /> 

In 1964, the first [[franchisee]] opened, in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], CA. In 1967, the 100th restaurant opened at 400 South Brookhurst in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. The first location east of the [[Mississippi River]] opened in [[Springfield, Ohio]] in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wedell|first1=Katie|title=Local restaurateur remembered as 'Mayor of Main Street'|url=http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/local/local-restaurateur-remembered-as-mayor-of-main-str/nnCH4/|website=Springfield News-Sun|publisher=Cox Media Group|date=August 3, 2015|access-date=August 2, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817115321/http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/local/local-restaurateur-remembered-as-mayor-of-main-str/nnCH4/|archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref><ref name=company /> Original Taco Bells featured walk-up windows only, with no indoor seating or drive-thru service.

In 2016, Taco Bell built a restaurant out of five [[Cargo containers|cargo shipping containers]] for the Texas music festival, [[South by Southwest]].

A large advertising push by Taco Bell was begun in late February 2011 in response to a consumer protection lawsuit filed against the company by an Alabama law firm. The promotion sought to counter allegations that the company falsely advertised the ratio of ingredients in its beef filling for its tacos. The spots featured employees and franchisees stating that the filling has always been a mixture of 88% beef and various spices and binders and nothing else. The ad followed several full-page print ads in the ''New York Times'' and other newspapers that featured the headline "Thank you for suing us."<ref name="Independent-Advert">{{cite news |title=Taco Bell launches saucy ad campaigns against meat allegations |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/taco-bell-launches-saucy-ad-campaigns-against-meat-allegations-2230712.html |access-date=March 6, 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |date=March 3, 2011 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306093741/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/taco-bell-launches-saucy-ad-campaigns-against-meat-allegations-2230712.html |archive-date=March 6, 2011  }}</ref> Additionally, the chain added a new social campaign using [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. The company invested heavily in the campaign, spending more than $3 million ([[United States Dollar|USD]]) putting out its message—about 20 percent more than the company usually spends on an advertising program. The various campaigns came shortly before the company began its official response to the suit in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] and were designed to bring public opinion into their camp. Various analysts stated that the company would have been better off using a grass-root campaign that involved in store advertising and other non-broadcast media.<ref name=DB-AP>{{cite news |last=Chapman |first=Michelle |title=Taco Bell to fight meat filling claims via TV ads |url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/ci_17504527 |access-date=March 6, 2011 |work=The Daily Breeze |date=February 28, 2011 |agency=Associated Press |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708220429/http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/ci_17504527 |archive-date=July 8, 2011  }}</ref> The suit was eventually withdrawn,<ref name="AP-Schreiner">{{cite news|last=Schreiner |first=Bruce |title=Taco Bell beef lawsuit dropped |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/taco-bell-beef-lawsuit-dropped/ |access-date=April 8, 2020 |newspaper=Seattle Times |date=April 20, 2011 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref> and the company continued its advertising response by publicly requesting an apology from the suing firm of Beasley Allen.

=== Discontinued menu items ===

One of Taco Bell's original 1960s menu items was the Chiliburger, later known as the Bell Burger, then the Bell Beefer. This was a [[loose meat]] sandwich with taco-seasoned ground beef, shredded cheese and lettuce, diced onions and tomato with mild red sauce, served on a steamed hamburger bun. The sandwich was removed from the menu sometime in the late 1980s to keep a strictly Tex Mex-inspired line up.<ref>{{cite news|last=Velasco|first=Schuyler|title=10 fast foods that have disappeared: 3.

Taco Bell in [[Singapore]] existed for a number of years, mostly as combination stores with KFC such as the one that operated at the Funan Digital Life Mall, but in 2008, Taco Bell completely pulled out of Singapore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funan.com.sg|title=Funan DigitaLife Mall|publisher=Funan.com.sg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831052738/http://www.funan.com.sg/|archive-date=August 31, 2009|url-status=dead|access-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref>

====South Korea====
There are currently two locations in [[Seoul]], in the [[Itaewon]] and [[Hongdae area|Hongdae]] districts, which attract the most foreigners and college students. The two branches opened in the summer of 2010, Itaewon's branch coming first. A Taco Bell had long been a presence at the U.S. Army's [[Yongsan Garrison]], which is off-limits to non-military personnel, and for a time there was a tongue-in-cheek grassroots campaign by non-Korean, non-military foreigners in Seoul to get another Taco Bell location.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCTfttE0w_E|title=We Want Taco Bell- EV Boyz|date=July 29, 2009|publisher=YouTube|access-date=August 16, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019035857/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCTfttE0w_E|archive-date=October 19, 2013}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, PepsiCo opened several Taco Bell locations inside the [[Moscow metro system]], including Metro Park Kulturi and [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Metro Komsomolskaya]].

Taco Bell first opened in Australia in September 1981, but Taco Bell was ordered to change its name after the owner of a local restaurant successfully sued Taco Bell for misleading conduct.<ref>{{cite AustLII|FCA|219|1981|litigants=Re Taco Bell Pty Limited v Taco Company of Australia Inc |parallelcite=(1981) 60 [[Federal Law Reports|FLR]] 60 |date=December 22, 1981 |courtname=auto}}</ref> The local restaurant was called "Taco Bell's Casa" and had been operating in Australia since the 1970s. The owner successfully argued that Sydneysiders would confuse the takeaway chain with his restaurant, and this would damage his reputation. Taco Bell later opened in 1997 in Australia with a store in the cinema district on [[George Street, Sydney]] and a year later in 1998 within a few [[KFC]] stores in the state of New South Wales, but by 2005, the Taco Bell brand was pulled out of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11160720|title=Taco Bell back on menu for NZ|first=Christopher|last=Adams|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=November 21, 2013|access-date=June 2, 2015}}</ref>

On September 13, 2017, [[Collins Foods]] announced that Taco Bell would return to the Australian market, with their first store being situated in the [[Brisbane]] suburb of [[Annerley, Queensland|Annerley]] in [[Queensland]] using a refurbished [[Sizzler]] restaurant which had closed earlier that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/a5a6fb_536db53e80d844f3b22b75c5966d581c.pdf|title=The Taco's Out of the Bag|date=September 13, 2017|access-date=September 22, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923001951/https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/a5a6fb_536db53e80d844f3b22b75c5966d581c.pdf|archive-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref> The Annerley store opened on Saturday November 4, 2017 with about 50 people camping out overnight to be first to try the store.
