==Early life==
Jenkins was born in [[Victorville, California]],<ref name=NHPR>{{cite web|last=del Barco|first= Mandalit |date=June 2, 2017|url=http://nhpr.org/post/when-time-was-new-wonder-woman-brings-sunlight-dc-universe |title='When Time Was New': 'Wonder Woman' Brings Sunlight To The DC Universe|publisher=[[New Hampshire Public Radio]] |accessdate=July 27, 2017|quote=She was born in 1971 on an Air Force base in Victorville, Calif.

When Jenkins was 7, her father died during a [[NATO]] mock dogfight at the age of 31. Her mother then took her and her sister to [[San Francisco]] so that Jenkins could go to school to become an environmental scientist. There, Jenkins said in 2017, seeing the original ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' starring [[Christopher Reeve]] inspired her to pursue film as a career.<ref name="variety.com">{{cite web |last1=Setoodeh |first1=Ramin |title='Wonder Woman' Director Patty Jenkins on Equal Pay, Hollywood Sexism and James Cameron's Nasty Words |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/features/patty-jenkins-wonder-woman-hollywood-sexism-equal-pay-james-cameron-1202583237/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety Power of Women LA]]|issue=2|date=October 2017 |accessdate=October 25, 2018}}</ref>

''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

Beginning in junior high school, Jenkins took interest in [[photography]], [[painting]], and [[Screen printing|screen-printing]]. At age 20, while interning at a commercial production company, she heeded a suggestion that she could receive film training if she worked on set for free. After doing so for some months, Jenkins advanced to [[second assistant camera]] and [[focus puller]], then spent 10 years as a [[Camera operator|cameraperson]]. While shooting a [[Michael Jackson]] music video, her [[Cinematographer|director of photography]] recommended that she attend the [[American Film Institute]] to learn [[director (film)|directing]]. She later made a superhero [[short film]] that played the [[AFI Fest]]. There she met [[Brad Wyman]], who later introduced her to producer [[Donald Kushner]], leading to her directing her first feature film, ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'' (2003).<ref name=":0">{{cite AV Media|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=On Directing: Patty Jenkins with Bryce Dallas Howard|date=2017-11-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOZlQPOBzoE|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref>

==Career==
After ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'', about [[serial killer]] [[Aileen Wuornos]], proved a critical and commercial success, Jenkins was approached by former [[United States Air Force]] [[test pilot]] [[Chuck Yeager]] to develop a film about his life. When that project did not reach fruition, she attempted to make a [[Ryan Gosling]] movie titled ''I Am Superman'', a film with no relation to [[Superman|the DC Comics character]], but development ended when she became pregnant. Jenkins spent the next decade working in television.<ref name="THRMay2017" />

In 2011 she directed one segment in the made-for-television anthology film ''[[Five (2011 film)|Five]]''. In October 2011, she was hired to direct ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', the first sequel to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', but left the project after less than two months over creative differences.<ref>{{cite web|title='Thor 2' Director Patty Jenkins Exits|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/thor-2-patty-jenkins-270210|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> In 2014, she was attached to ''Sweetheart'', a film about a female assassin,<ref>{{cite web|title=Patty Jenkins Signs On For Second Film – Sweetheart|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2014/05/patty-jenkins-signs-on-for-second-film-sweetheart-206750/|website=IndieWire}}</ref> but that film was never made.

While promoting ''Wonder Woman'', Jenkins mentioned that her next project would likely be a limited television series developed with her husband.<ref name=THRMay2017/> This project was later revealed as a horror series titled ''Riprore'' to premiere on the [[video-on-demand]] service [[Shudder (streaming service)|Shudder]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Giroux|first1=Jack |title=‘Wonder Woman’ Director Patty Jenkins is Making a Horror Project For Shudder |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/patty-jenkins-horror-project-in-the-works/|website=Slash Film |date=June 6, 2017}}</ref> In July 2017, the US cable network [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] announced Jenkins would direct the premiere of a six-episode television drama, ''[[I Am the Night (TV series)|I Am the Night]]'', written by her author husband Sam Sheridan and featuring her ''Wonder Woman'' star [[Chris Pine]].

Pictures in the United States on June 5, 2020, but, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the release was delayed until December 25, 2020 worldwide. It had originally been scheduled for November 1, 2019.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Anthony|last1=D'Alessandro|title=‘Wonder Woman 1984’ Flies To Summer 2020|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/wonder-woman-1984-flies-to-summer-2020-1202487260/|newspaper=Deadline|date=October 22, 2018|accessdate=October 22, 2018}}</ref> She has been negotiating the terms of her contract with [[Warner Brothers]] for an estimated 7 to 9 million dollars, which will be a record  breaking salary for a female filmmaker. She signed on to the first film with no guarantee of directing a second film, but envisioned the second one during the making of [[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]], which turned out to benefit her greatly. When she was signed on to do the second film, she had the ability to get a much higher salary than she would have if she had been signed on to do both films from the beginning. Her goal with her negotiations were to make sure she would get the same salary that her male counterparts would be getting for doing this movie and she seems to have succeeded.<ref name="variety.com"/>

===Other work===
Jenkins, ''Wonder Woman'' actresses [[Gal Gadot]] and [[Lynda Carter]], [[DC Entertainment]] President [[Diane Nelson (comics)|Diane Nelson]], and U.N. Under-Secretary General [[Cristina Gallach]] appeared at the [[United Nations]] on October 21, 2016, the 75th anniversary of the first appearance of Wonder Woman, to mark the character's designation by the United Nations as its "Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls".<ref name=EW>Serrao, Nivea (October 13, 2016).

[http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/13/health/wonder-woman-un-ambassador-trnd/index.html "UN drops Wonder Woman as honorary ambassador"]. [[CNN]].</ref> The decision was met with protests from UN staff members who stated in their petition to UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] that the character is "not culturally encompassing or sensitive", and served to objectify women. As a result, the character was stripped of the designation, and the project ended December 16.<ref name=CNN/>

== Style and themes ==
In the film ''Monster'', she explored the issues of morality and feminity.<ref>{{Citation|last=CBS This Morning|title=The woman behind "Wonder Woman"|date=2017-05-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXo8WyHsUg|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> In ''Wonder Woman'', Jenkins suggests that the audience experiences the journey of the lead character Diana Prince through Diana's eyes. Diana is portrayed as the universal human character who the audience never experiences from the outside. Jenkins suggests that the major theme of the film is the idea of there being no other villain than humans themselves. She mentions how she was influenced by ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and how that is incorporated in her own superhero film.

Some of Jenkins' mentors and influencers includes [[Gary Ross]], [[Kathryn Bigelow]] and [[Steve Perry]]. She mentions that she often likes to discuss the process of making music with musicians like Steve. The organization and structure of music, according to Jenkins, has a lot of parallels to theater and drama. She uses this rhythm, as a director, to direct the delivery of dialogues.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Jenkins married Sam Sheridan, a former firefighter and the author of the book ''A Fighter's Heart''.<ref name="marriage"/> They have a son<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Lisa|title=Natural-Born Director|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1301-Winter-2013/Director-Patty-Jenkins.aspx|date=Winter 2013|magazine=[[DGA Quarterly]]}}</ref> and live in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref name=THRMay2017/>
