"'''Don't Stop the Music'''" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] for her third studio album, ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]'' (2007). It was released worldwide on September 7, 2007, as the album's fourth single. The song was written by Tawanna Dabney and its producers [[Stargate (production team)|StarGate]]. [[Michael Jackson]] also received a songwriting credit for the sampling of the line "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" from Jackson's 1983 single "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'|Wanna Be Startin' Somethin{{'-}}]]". Both Rihanna and Jackson were sued by Cameroonian musician [[Manu Dibango]], who asserted that the [[Hook (music)|hook]] originated in his 1972 song "[[Soul Makossa]]". "Don't Stop the Music" is a [[Electronic dance music|dance]] track that features rhythmic devices used primarily in [[hip hop music]].

Many [[Music journalism|music journalists]] praised the sampling of the "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" hook. The song received a number of accolades, including a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]]. "Don't Stop the Music" reached number one in nine countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and Switzerland. In the UK, it reached number four on the [[UK Singles Chart|singles chart]] and it was certified platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI). The single peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number one on the US ''Billboard'' [[Dance Club Songs]] charts. Certified four times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), as of 2015, it has sold more than 3.7&nbsp;million copies in the US.

[[Anthony Mandler]] filmed the song's music video in [[Prague]]. In the video, Rihanna and her friends sneak into the back of a candy store that contains a secret club, and she parties with club-goers. The singer performed "Don't Stop the Music" at the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards]] and the [[2008 NRJ Music Awards|NRJ Music Awards]] in 2008, and included it on her [[Good Girl Gone Bad Tour|Good Girl Gone Bad]], [[Last Girl on Earth]], [[Loud Tour|Loud]] and [[Diamonds World Tour]] [[set list]]s. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most-performed songs of 2009. English recording artist [[Jamie Cullum]] released a cover of the song as the second single from his 2009 album ''[[The Pursuit (album)|The Pursuit]]'', and his version charted in several European countries.

"Don't Stop the Music" was written and produced by the Norwegian production duo [[Stargate (production team)|StarGate]], with additional songwriting by Tawanna Dabney. [[Michael Jackson]] received a songwriting credit for the sampling of the line "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" from his 1983 single "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'|Wanna Be Startin' Somethin]]".<ref name="Notes"/><ref name="composition"/> Tim Sturges and Phillip Ramos provided additional production for the song. It was recorded at Battery Studios in New York City and [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in Los Angeles by [[Mikkel S. Eriksen]] and Al Hemberger. [[Phil Tan]] and Josh Houghkirk [[Mixing (music production)|mixed]] the single, and StarGate provided vocal production and instrumentation.<ref name="Notes"/>

In February 2009, Cameroonian musician [[Manu Dibango]] filed a lawsuit claiming that "Don't Stop the Music" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin{{'"}} used the "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" hook without his permission. According to Dibango, the line is from his 1972 single "[[Soul Makossa]]". [[Agence France-Presse]] reported that Jackson admitted that he borrowed the line for "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin{{'"}} and settled out of court. When Rihanna asked Jackson in 2007 for permission to sample the line, he allegedly approved the request without contacting Dibango beforehand. Dibango's attorneys brought the case before a court in Paris, demanding [[Euro|€]]500,000 in damages and asking for [[Sony BMG]], [[EMI]] and [[Warner Music]] to be "barred from receiving 'mama-say mama-sa'-related income until the matter is resolved".<ref name="lawsuit">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/04/rihanna-michael-jackson-manu-dibango?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Rihanna and Michael Jackson sued by African singer|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=January 17, 2012|archive-date=November 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105201413/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/04/rihanna-michael-jackson-manu-dibango?INTCMP=SRCH|url-status=live}}</ref> The judge ruled that Dibango's claim was inadmissible: a year earlier, a different Paris-area judge had required Universal Music to include Dibango's name in the liner notes of future French releases of "Don't Stop the Music", and at the time of this earlier court appearance, Dibango had withdrawn legal action, thereby waiving his moral right to seek further damages.<ref name="rfi">{{cite news|url=http://musique.rfi.fr/musique/20090218-dibango-recale-face-jackson-rihanna|title=Dibango recalé face à Jackson et Rihanna|last=Lavaine|first=Bertrand|date=February 18, 2009|publisher=[[Radio France Internationale]]|language=French|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212183303/http://musique.rfi.fr/musique/20090218-dibango-recale-face-jackson-rihanna|archivedate=February 12, 2017|accessdate=February 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="lapresse">{{cite news|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/arts/vie-de-stars/200902/18/01-828531-laction-de-manu-dibango-contre-michael-jackson-et-rihanna-irrecevable.php|title=L'action de Manu Dibango contre Michael Jackson et Rihanna irrecevable|date=February 18, 2009|work=[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]|language=French|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212183200/http://www.lapresse.ca/arts/vie-de-stars/200902/18/01-828531-laction-de-manu-dibango-contre-michael-jackson-et-rihanna-irrecevable.php|archivedate=February 12, 2017|accessdate=February 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the video, Rihanna and two friends arrive at a nightclub in a yellow taxi and enter a candy store where a boy is standing with his mother. Rihanna tells the boy not to tell anyone where they are going, and the singer and her friends sneak into the back of the store (where there is a secret nightclub entrance). The narrative is intercut with Rihanna singing the song against a wall and dancing in the club. After she enters the club, she checks her makeup in a restroom as she sings.

Rihanna returns to the dance floor for the chorus, dancing and singing with her friends. Her fellow club-goers clap along with the sample from "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin{{'"}}. [[VH1]]'s Christopher Rosa ranked the video 18th on his list of Rihanna's 20 sexiest videos: "This dance-by-numbers song gets a facelift with its brisk, energetic video featuring R as the undisputed queen of the clubs".<ref name="VH1">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/54781/rihanna-sexiest-videos/|title=Rihanna's 20 Sexiest Music Videos Ranked|publisher=[[VH1]]|last=Rosa|first=Christopher|date=February 20, 2015|accessdate=March 8, 2015|archive-date=August 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817191453/http://www.vh1.com/news/54781/rihanna-sexiest-videos/|url-status=live}}</ref>
