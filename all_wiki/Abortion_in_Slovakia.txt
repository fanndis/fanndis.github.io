'''Abortion in Slovakia''' is legal on request until 12 weeks of pregnancy, and for medical reasons at later stages.<ref>https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/4814/abortion-law-slovakia</ref>
[[Abortion]] was fully legalized on 23 October 1986.<ref name="un">[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/slovakia.doc Slovakia - ABORTION POLICY - United Nations]</ref> Abortions were provided with restrictions in [[Slovakia]] and what is now the [[Czech Republic]] as early as 19 December 1957,<ref name="un"/> but it was the 1986 law which removed the requirement of medical approval for abortions before the twelfth week of [[pregnancy]].<ref name="un"/> Girls under 16 require parental consent for an abortion, while girls aged 16 and 17 can have the procedure performed without consent but the parents still have to be notified.<ref name="un"/>

To procure an abortion on demand, a woman must have not exceeded the twelfth week of her pregnancy, and she must make her request for an abortion known in writing to her gynaecologist, and  counseling and [[birth control]] information is given to the woman, and she is referred to a hospital to terminate her pregnancy.<ref name="un"/> After twelve weeks, a group of physicians must approve the abortion, which in practice only occurs if there is a chance of irreparable harm for either the [[fetus]] or the mother.<ref name="un"/>

In October 2020, a bill that would have tightened abortion law was defeated by the [[Parliament of Slovakia]], with 59 votes against and 58 votes in favor.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovakia-abortions/slovak-conservatives-hope-to-tighten-abortion-law-rights-groups-protest-idUSKCN26F2JN</ref><ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-slovakia-abortions/slovak-parliament-narrowly-rejects-tightening-of-abortion-rules-idUKKBN2752M1</ref>

The abortion rate peaked in the late 1980s after the liberalization of the old abortion law, with nearly 40 abortions per 100 births.<ref name="births">[http://www.infostat.sk/slovakpopin/abortionx.htm Abortion from InfoStat of Slovakia]</ref> In 2004, the figure fell below 15 abortions per 100 births, its lowest rate since the government started tracking abortion figures in 1958.<ref name="births"/>

{{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 13.9 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years. <ref name="un2013">{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}</ref>
