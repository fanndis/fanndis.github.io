In an interview published on 11 August 2017, Halimah gave her views on the reserved presidential election. She said that it "shows we don't only talk about multiracialism, but we talk about it in the context of meritocracy or opportunities for everyone, and we actually practise it". Although some commentators have felt that the reserved election did not promote meritocracy, Halimah rejected that view, as she described, "All candidates have to qualify ... If we weaken eligibility criteria for those taking part in a reserved election, yes, then we are compromising meritocracy for representation. We are not - the same criteria apply to everybody". Regarding commentators who have questioned the lower qualifying bar for public sector candidates like herself, Halimah said, "It is an open, transparent system ... has been in place since 1991".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/reserved-election-affirms-spores-core-values-halimah|title=Reserved presidential election affirms Singapore's core values: Halimah Yacob|last=hermes|date=11 August 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017|archive-date=12 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212022228/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/reserved-election-affirms-spores-core-values-halimah|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 25 August 2017, Halimah launched her official campaign website, including her campaign slogan "Do Good Do Together", which was criticised by many for being ungrammatical. She defended her slogan, explaining that it is meant to be catchy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/halimah-defends-ungrammatical-campaign-slogan-calls-it-catchy|title='Do Good Do Together' catchy, easy to understand: Halimah|work=TODAYonline|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en|archive-date=24 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424182046/https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/halimah-defends-ungrammatical-campaign-slogan-calls-it-catchy|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to public queries whether Halimah broke election rules by campaigning ahead of the nomination day, the Elections Department clarified that its rule which forbids candidates from campaigning before close of nomination only applies to candidates who are nominated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redwiretimes.com/kua-politics/pe2017-election-dept-clears-halimah-yacob-of-breaking-no-campaigning-before-nomination-day-rule/|title=PE2017: Election Dept Clears Halimah Yacob of Breaking No Campaigning before Nomination Day Rule|date=30 August 2017|accessdate=12 September 2017|archive-date=6 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906061950/http://redwiretimes.com/kua-politics/pe2017-election-dept-clears-halimah-yacob-of-breaking-no-campaigning-before-nomination-day-rule/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Halimah's campaign expenses reached only $220,875 out of the $754,982.40 the legal limit.

=== Reactions ===
Halimah's sudden resignation as sole minority MP in Marsiling–Yew Tee GRC has sparked calls for a by-election as the purpose of GRC is to ensure minority representation. The PAP government refused to hold a by-election, culminating to the filing of lawsuit by Wong Souk Yee, a resident in the GRC. A hearing was set for 15 January 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redwiretimes.com/kua-politics/court-hearing-on-by-election-for-marsiling-yew-tee-grc-to-be-held-in-jan-2018/|title=Court Hearing on By-Election for Marsiling–Yew Tee GRC to Be Held in Jan 2018|date=13 November 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017|archive-date=16 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116235825/http://redwiretimes.com/kua-politics/court-hearing-on-by-election-for-marsiling-yew-tee-grc-to-be-held-in-jan-2018/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 13 September 2017, the [[Singapore Democratic Party]] filed a lawsuit in the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] against the PAP government for refusing to call a by-election in Marsiling–Yew Tee GRC following Halimah's resignation from her post as the sole minority MP in her constituency.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/sdp-files-lawsuit-singapore-government-not-calling-marsiling-yew-tee-election-093640222.html |title=PE 2017: SDP suing government for not calling by-election |publisher=Sg.news.yahoo.com |date=2016-10-19 |accessdate=2017-09-15 |archive-date=14 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914220932/https://sg.news.yahoo.com/sdp-files-lawsuit-singapore-government-not-calling-marsiling-yew-tee-election-093640222.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In a High Court hearing conducted on 23 January 2018, Wong's lawyer, Peter Low, argued that the Parliamentary Elections Act should be interpreted such that all MPs of the group representation constituency have to leave their spots when one or more seats are left empty, or when only one remaining MP is a minority candidate. He cited Article 49 (1) of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]], which states that when "the seat of a Member… has become vacant for any reason other than a dissolution of Parliament, the vacancy shall be filled by election" to support his argument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redwiretimes.com/kua-politics/sdps-legal-challenge-calling-for-by-election-in-marsiling-yew-tee-grc-heard-in-court/|title=SDP's Legal Challenge Calling for By-Election in Marsiling–Yew Tee GRC Heard in Court|first=Redwire|last=Singapore|date=22 January 2018|website=RedWire Times Singapore|accessdate=25 March 2019|archive-date=13 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713182439/http://redwiretimes.com/kua-politics/sdps-legal-challenge-calling-for-by-election-in-marsiling-yew-tee-grc-heard-in-court/|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the Elections Department announced that Halimah was the only possible candidate for the presidency, global media monitoring house [[Meltwater (company)|Meltwater]] observed a significant increase in negative sentiment on social media surrounding the Presidential Elections from 11 to 12 September 2017.
