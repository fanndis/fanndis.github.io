'''''David and Lisa''''' is a 1962 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Frank Perry]].  It is based on the second story in the two-in-one novellas ''Jordi/Lisa and David'' by [[Theodore Isaac Rubin]]; the screenplay, written by Frank Perry's wife [[Eleanor Perry]] (née Rosenfeld), tells the story of a bright young man suffering from a [[mental illness]] which, among other symptoms, has instilled in him a [[Haphephobia|fear of being touched]]. This lands him in a residential treatment center, where he meets Lisa, a similarly ill young woman who displays a [[split personality]].

The film earned Perry a nomination for the [[35th Academy Awards|1963]] [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and one for Eleanor Perry for her [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|screenplay]].

The film was later adapted into a stage play in 1967 and a [[Television film|made-for-television film]] in 1998.

==Plot==
David Clemens is brought to a residential [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] treatment center by his apparently caring mother.  He becomes very upset when one of the residents brushes his hand, as he believes that being touched can kill him. Cold and distant, he mainly concentrates on his studies, especially that of clocks, with which he appears to be obsessed. It is later revealed that he has a recurring dream in which he murders people by means of a giant clock.

He meets Lisa Brandt, a girl who has two personalities: one of them, Lisa, can only speak in [[rhyme]]s, while the other, Muriel, cannot speak, but can only write. David befriends her by talking to her in rhymes. Over time, he begins to open up to his psychiatrist, Dr. Alan Swinford and also becomes friendly with another resident, Simon, which provokes Lisa's jealousy. Following an argument when his mother visits, David's parents decide that he should leave the place. He returns to his parents' house, but after a short time, runs away to the treatment center, where he is allowed to stay.

One day Lisa realizes that she is both Lisa and Muriel and that they are the same person. After this breakthrough, she seeks out David, but he is busy listening to Simon play a Bach piece on the piano.  Lisa turns on the [[metronome]], interrupting Simon's playing and provoking David's anger. Then, Lisa runs away from the center and takes the train into [[Center City, Philadelphia]], unnoticed. David and the staff fruitlessly search for her until the next morning, when David realizes that she might have returned to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], where she had once embraced a statue of a mother and child.

David and Dr. Swinford rush to the museum, where David finds Lisa on the museum steps. Upon seeing David, Lisa appears to be cured and speaks to him in [[prose]]. David, overcoming his own fear of touch for the first time, allows her to hold his hand, while they walk down the stairs to go on their return trip.

==Play adaptation==
In 1967, the film was adapted into a stage play, but only ran for a short period.

===Plot of the stage play===
The play begins with David Clemens and his mother preparing to leave to bring David to "school". We later learn this is a school for children with mental and psychological issues. David's mother is overprotective and overbearing, and it shows. At the station, a porter touches David's arm, and we learn that David is afraid to be touched.

We meet a variety of teachers and other students, particularly Dr. Alan Swinford, the head psychologist, and are introduced to the school. We learn that David has an obsession with clocks, and also with death. We are also introduced to the other title character, Lisa, who has a split personality: one who will only speak in rhymes and the other who will not speak, but will only write or draw her thoughts. Over time, David and Lisa befriend each other, until midway through the play, after an embittering visit, David's parents take him away from the school.

David eventually runs away from his home and comes back to the school, where he is allowed to stay. One day, however, Lisa is annoying David as he listens to another child playing the piano. David becomes cross and shouts at her, and Lisa runs away from the school. David and the head psychologist, Dr. Alan Swinford, go out in search of her, and arrive just in time to save Lisa from the ravages of two boys in a city park. David and Lisa are both relieved that the other is there for them, and somehow Lisa is cured of her two personalities and becomes truly herself, speaking "plain straight" to David for the first time. David extends his hand and asks her to take it, conquering his fear of being touched, and they walk off together, hand in hand.

==Remake==
In 1998, the film was [[Remake|remade]] into a [[Television film|made-for-television film]] that premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on November 1, 1998. Produced by [[Oprah Winfrey]] and directed by Lloyd Kramer, the film starred [[Lukas Haas]] as David, [[Brittany Murphy]] as Lisa, and [[Sidney Poitier]] as Dr. Swinford, with a supporting cast featuring [[Debi Mazar]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Kim Murphy (actress)|Kim Murphy]], [[Giuseppe Andrews]], [[Vicellous Reon Shannon]], [[Gene Wolande]], [[Kimiko Gelman]], and Ty Hodges. The scenes were shifted to the Los Angeles area, including the Museum of Natural History at Exposition Park and Venice Beach.
