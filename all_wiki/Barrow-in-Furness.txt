'''Barrow-in-Furness''' is a town in [[Cumbria]], North-West England. [[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Lancashire]], it was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1867 and merged with Dalton-in-Furness Urban District in 1974 to form the [[Barrow-in-Furness (borough)|Borough of Barrow-in-Furness]]. At the tip of the [[Furness|Furness peninsula]], close to the [[Lake District]], it is bordered by [[Morecambe Bay]], the [[Duddon Estuary]] and the [[Irish Sea]]. In 2011, Barrow's population was 57,000, making it the second largest urban area in Cumbria after [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. Natives of Barrow, as well as the local dialect, are known as [[Barrovian]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jenkins |first=Russell |date=22 December 2006 |title=Chocolate blog sends town into meltdown |journal=The Times |pages=15}}</ref>

In the [[Middle Ages]], Barrow was a small [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with [[Furness Abbey]], now on the outskirts of the modern-day town, controlling the local economy before its [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] in 1537. The iron prospector [[Henry Schneider]] arrived in Furness in 1839 and, with other investors, opened the [[Furness Railway]] in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast. Further [[hematite]] deposits were discovered, of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel. For a period of the late 19th century, the [[Barrow Hematite Steel Company]]-owned steelworks was the world's largest.<ref>[http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/about_us/ironbridge_archaeology/projects/barrow/ Barrow Steelworks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819160207/http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/about_us/ironbridge_archaeology/projects/barrow/ |date=19 August 2007 }}</ref>

Barrow's location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels, a shift that was accelerated during [[World War I]] and the local yard's specialisation in submarines. The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after [[World War II]], leaving [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering|Vickers]] shipyard as Barrow's main industry and employer. Several [[Royal Navy]] [[Royal Navy Fleet Flagship|flagships]], the vast majority of its [[Nuclear submarine#Royal Navy of the United Kingdom|nuclear submarines]] as well as numerous other naval vessels, [[ocean liner]]s and [[oil tanker]]s have been manufactured at the facility.

The end of the [[Cold War]] and subsequent [[peace dividend|decrease in military spending]] saw high unemployment in the town through lack of contracts; despite this, the [[BAE Systems]] shipyard remains operational as the UK's largest by workforce (9,500 employees in 2020) and is now undergoing a major expansion associated with the {{sclass-|Dreadnought|submarine|0}} submarine programme.<ref name="unemployment" /> Today Barrow is also a hub for energy generation and handling. Offshore wind farms form one of the highest concentrations of turbines in the world, including [[Walney Wind Farm|the second largest offshore farm]], with multiple operating bases in Barrow.<ref name="walneyextension">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-45424559 Walney £1bn offshore wind farm is world's largest] ''BBC News'', 6 September 2018.

==Toponymy==
The name was originally that of an island, Barrai, which can be traced back to 1190. This was later renamed Old Barrow, recorded as Oldebarrey in 1537, and Old Barrow Insula and Barrohead in 1577. The island was then joined to the mainland and the town took its name. The name itself seems to mean "island with promontory", combining British ''barro-'' and Old Norse ''ey'', but it is more likely that [[Scandinavia]]n settlers simply accepted ''barro-'' as a meaningless name, and so added an explanatory [[Old Norse]] second element.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mills |first=David |title=The Place Names of Lancashire |publisher=Batsford Books |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-7134-3248-0 |location=London}}</ref>

===Nicknames===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Barrow was nicknamed "the English Chicago" because of the sudden and rapid growth in its industry, economic stature and overall size.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Barrow-in-Furness: kept on life support by perpetual warfare |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/barrow-in-furness-kept-on-life-support-by-perpetual-warfare/5011365.article}}</ref> More recently the town has been dubbed the "capital of [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] Britain" by  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', reflecting its strong working class identity.<ref>{{Cite web |title=most working class town – Google Search |url=https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1T4ACAW_en___GB384&q=most+working+class+town |website=www.google.com}}</ref> Barrow is also often jokingly referred to as being at the end of the longest [[cul-de-sac]] in the country because of its isolated location at the tip of the Furness peninsula.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Westcott |first=Lucy Townsend and Kathryn |date=17 July 2012 |title=Five lesser-spotted things in the census |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18853714}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Barrow-in-Furness}}

===Early history===
Barrow and the surrounding area has been settled non-continuously for several millennia with evidence of [[Neolithic]] inhabitants on [[Walney Island]]. Despite a rich history of [[Roman Britain|Roman]] settlement across Cumbria and the discovery of related artefacts in the Barrow area, no buildings or structures have been found to support the idea of a functioning Roman community on the [[Furness]] peninsula.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Roman Treasure |url=http://www.dockmuseum.org.uk/Romans |access-date=3 August 2015 |publisher=Dock Museum}}</ref> The [[Furness Hoard]] discovery of [[Viking]] silver coins and other artefacts in 2011 provided significant archaeological evidence of [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Norse]] settlement in the early 9th century. Several areas of Barrow including [[Yarlside]] and [[Ormsgill]], as well as "Barrow" and "Furness", have names of [[Old Norse]] origin. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 recorded the settlements of Hietun, Rosse and Hougenai, which are now the districts of [[Hawcoat]], [[Roose]] and [[Walney Island|Walney]] respectively.
[[File:Furness Abbey, April 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Furness Abbey]], one of England's most powerful monasteries in the Middle Ages]]

In the [[Middle Ages]] the Furness peninsula was controlled by the [[Cistercian]] monks of the Abbey of St Mary of Furness, known as [[Furness Abbey]]. This was located in the "Vale of Nightshade", now on the outskirts of the town.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Local history and heritage |url=http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/Default.aspx?page=150#abbey |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609195921/http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=150#abbey |archive-date=9 June 2007 |access-date=10 June 2007 |publisher=Barrow Borough Council |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Founded for the [[Congregation of Savigny|Savigniac order]], it was built on the orders of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] in 1123. Soon after the abbey's foundation the monks discovered iron ore deposits, later to provide the basis for the Furness economy. These thin strata, close to the surface, were extracted through open cut workings,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Iron Mining |url=http://www.cumbria-industries.org.uk/ironmining.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702101913/http://www.cumbria-industries.org.uk/ironmining.htm |archive-date=2 July 2007 |access-date=10 June 2007 |publisher=Industries of Cumbria}}</ref> which were then smelted by the monks.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Raymond |first=Michael |title=A Forgotten Medieval Powerhouse: Furness Abbey |url=http://newhistories.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/wordpress/a-forgotten-medieval-powerhouse-furness-abbey/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425033830/http://newhistories.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/wordpress/a-forgotten-medieval-powerhouse-furness-abbey/ |archive-date=25 April 2016 |access-date=3 August 2015 |publisher=New Histories Magazine}}</ref> The proceeds from mining, along with agriculture and fisheries, meant that by the 15th century the abbey had become the second richest and most powerful Cistercian abbey in England, after [[Fountains Abbey]] in Yorkshire.<ref>{{Cite web |last=English Heritage |title=Furness Abbey |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConProperty.149 |access-date=6 May 2007 |publisher=English Heritage}}</ref> The monks of Furness Abbey constructed a wooden tower on nearby [[Piel Island]] in 1212 which acted as their main trading point; it was twice invaded by the Scots, in 1316 and 1322. In 1327 [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] gave Furness Abbey a licence to [[crenellate]] the tower, and a [[motte-and-bailey castle]] was built. However Barrow itself was just a hamlet in the parish of [[Dalton-in-Furness]], reliant on the land and sea for survival. Small quantities of iron and ore were exported from jetties on the channel separating the village from Walney Island. Amongst the oldest buildings in Barrow are several cottages and farmhouses in [[Newbarns]] (now a ward of the borough) which date back to the early 17th century; as well as [[Rampside Hall]], a [[Grade I listed]] building and the best-preserved in the town from the 1600s. Even as late as 1843 there were still only 32 dwellings, including two pubs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Plan of Barrow 1843 |url=http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/pdf/summary%20of%20plan%20areas.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704111547/http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/pdf/summary%20of%20plan%20areas.pdf |archive-date=4 July 2007 |access-date=10 June 2007 |publisher=Barrow Borough Council |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===19th century===
[[File:Barrow Steelworks.jpg|thumb|left|[[Barrow Hematite Steel Company|Barrow Steelworks]] circa. 1877]]
In 1839 [[Henry Schneider]] arrived as a young speculator and dealer in iron, and he discovered large deposits of [[haematite]] in 1850. He and other investors founded the [[Furness Railway]], the first section of which opened in 1846, to transport the ore from the slate quarries at [[Kirkby-in-Furness]] and haematite mines at [[Lindal-in-Furness]] and [[Askam and Ireleth]] to a deep-water harbour near [[Roa Island]].<ref name="railway">{{Cite web |title=History of the Furness Railway Company |url=http://www.furnessrailwaytrust.org.uk/frco.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715153252/http://www.furnessrailwaytrust.org.uk/frco.htm |archive-date=15 July 2007 |access-date=8 July 2007 |publisher=The Furness Railway Trust}}</ref> The crucial and difficult link across [[Morecambe Bay]] between [[Ulverston]] and [[Carnforth]] on the main line was promoted, as the [[Ulverston and Lancaster Railway]], by a group led by [[John Brogden (industrialist)|John Brogden]] and opened in 1857. It was promptly purchased by the Furness Railway.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Marshall |first=J.D. |title=Furness and the Industrial Revolution |publisher=Michael Moon, Beckermet, Cumbria |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-904131-26-0 |pages=215–8 |orig-year=1958}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Richardson |first=Joseph |title=Furness Past and Present |year=1870 |volume=1 of 2 |pages=18–24}}</ref>

The docks built between 1863 and 1881 in the more sheltered channel between the mainland and [[Barrow Island (England)|Barrow Island]] replaced the port at Roa Island. The first dock to open was [[Devonshire Dock]] in 1867, and Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] stated his belief that "Barrow would become another Liverpool". The increasing quantities of iron ore mined in Furness were then brought into the centre of Barrow to be transported by sea.

[[File:Barrow Jute Works 1875.jpg|thumb|Painting of the [[Barrow Jute Works]] in 1875]]
The investors in the burgeoning mining and railway industries decided that greater profits could be made by smelting the iron ore and converting the resultant pig-iron into steel, and then exporting the finished product. Schneider and [[Sir James Ramsden|James Ramsden]], the railway's general manager, erected [[blast furnace]]s at Barrow that by 1876 formed the largest steelworks in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Barrow |url=http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/about_us/ironbridge_archaeology/projects/barrow/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819160207/http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/about_us/ironbridge_archaeology/projects/barrow/ |archive-date=19 August 2007 |access-date=25 August 2007 |publisher=[[Ironbridge Gorge]] Museum Trust |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Its success was a result of the availability of local iron ore and coal from the [[Cumberland]] mines and easy rail and sea transport. The Furness Railway, which counted local aristocrats [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire]] and the [[Duke of Buccleuch]] as investors, kick-started the [[Industrial Revolution]] on the peninsula. The railway brought mined ore to the town, where the steelworks produced large quantities of steel. It was used for shipbuilding, and derived products such as rails were also exported from the newly built docks.<ref name="railway" />

Barrow's population grew rapidly. Population figures for the town itself were not collected until 1871,<ref name="THB">{{Cite journal |last=Bainbridge |first=TH |year=1939 |title=Barrow in Furness: A Population Study |journal=Economic Geography |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=379–383 |doi=10.2307/141773 |jstor=141773}}</ref> though sources suggest that Barrow's population was still as low as 700 in 1851.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Timeline History of Barrow-in-Furness |url=http://www.visitoruk.com/Barrow-in-furness/19th-century-T454.html |access-date=16 July 2015 |publisher=VisitorUK}}</ref> During the first half of the 19th century, Barrow formed part of the parish of [[Dalton-in-Furness]], the population of which shows some of Barrow's early growth from the 1850s:

In 1871 Barrow's population was recorded at 18,584 and in 1881 at 47,259, less than forty years after the railway was built.<ref name="THB" /> The majority of migrants originated from elsewhere in Lancashire although significant numbers settled in Barrow from [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], which represented 11% and 7% of the local population in the 1890s.<ref name="Irish">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/cultureconflictm00macr_0 |title=Culture, Conflict, and Migration: The Irish in Victorian Cumbria |publisher=Liverpool University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780853236528 |access-date=6 April 2015 |url-access=registration}}</ref><ref name="IrishScot">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jI6lBgAAQBAJ |title=The Scots in Victorian and Edwardian Belfast: A Study in Elite Migration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780748679928 |access-date=1 April 2015}}</ref> By the turn of the 20th century, the Scottish-born population had increased to form the highest portion anywhere in England. In an attempt to diversify Barrow's economy James Ramsden founded the Barrow and Calcutta Jute Company in 1870 and the [[Barrow Jute Works]] was soon constructed alongside the Furness Railway line in [[Hindpool]]. The mill employed 2,000 women at its peak and was awarded a gold medal for its produce at the 1878 Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]].<ref name="Grace">{{Cite web |title=Barrow Flax and Jute Co |url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Barrow_Flax_and_Jute_Co |access-date=10 March 2013 |publisher=Grace's Guide}}</ref>

[[File:Barrow Works 1890.jpg|thumb|left|Barrow's shipyard circa. 1890]]
The sheltered strait between Barrow and Walney Island was an ideal location for the shipyard. The first ship to be built, the ''Jane Roper'', was launched in 1852; the first steamship, a 3,000-ton liner named ''Duke of Devonshire'', in 1873. Shipbuilding activity increased, and on 18 February 1871 the Barrow Shipbuilding Company was incorporated. Barrow's relative isolation from the United Kingdom's industrial heartlands meant that the newly formed company included several capabilities that would usually be subcontracted to other establishments. In particular, a large engineering works was constructed including a foundry and pattern shop, a forge, and an engine shop. In addition, the shipyard had a joiners' shop, a boat-building shed and a sailmaking and rigging loft.<ref name="barrow-works">{{Cite book |last=The Naval and Armaments Company Limited |title=The Works at Barrow-in-Furness of The Naval Construction and Armaments Company Limited – Historical and Descriptive |publisher=The Naval and Armaments Company Limited, partly reprinted from 'Engineering' magazine |year=1896 |location=Barrow-in-Furness |page=54}}</ref>

During these boom years, Ramsden proposed building a [[town planning|planned town]] to accommodate the large workforce which had arrived. There are few planned towns in the United Kingdom, and Barrow is one of the oldest. Its centre contains a grid of well-built terraced houses, with a tree-lined road leading away from a central square.

The Barrow Shipbuilding Company was taken over by the [[Sheffield]] steel firm of [[Vickers]] in 1897, by which time the shipyard had surpassed the railway and steelworks as the largest employer and landowner in Barrow. The company constructed [[Vickerstown]], modelled on [[George Cadbury]]'s [[Bournville]], on the adjacent Walney Island in the early 20th century to house its employees.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Partridge |first=Frank |date=16 March 2006 |title=The Complete Guide to: England's Islands |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent News & Media |location=London |url=http://travel.independent.co.uk/uk/article351869.ece |url-status=dead |access-date=10 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211406/http://travel.independent.co.uk/uk/article351869.ece |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref> It also commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] to design [[Abbey House, Barrow-in-Furness|Abbey House]] as a guest house and residence for its managing director, Commander Craven.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Homepage |url=http://www.abbeyhousehotel.com/ |access-date=3 August 2015 |publisher=Abbey House Hotel}}</ref>

By the 1890s the shipyard was heavily engaged in the construction of warships for the Royal Navy and also for export. The Royal Navy's first submarine, ''[[Holland 1]]'', was built in 1901,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Submarine History of Barrow-in-Furness |url=http://www.submarineheritage.com/history.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704042341/http://www.submarineheritage.com/history.html |archive-date=4 July 2007 |access-date=20 July 2007 |publisher=Submarine Heritage Centre}}</ref> and by 1914 the UK had the most advanced submarine fleet in the world, with 94% of it constructed by Vickers. Vickers was also famous for the construction of [[airship]]s and [[airship hangar]]s during the early 20th century. Originally constructed in a large shed at Cavendish Dock, production later relocated to [[Barrow/Walney Island Airport]]. [[HMA No. 1]], nicknamed the Mayfly is the most notable airship to have been built in Barrow. The first of its kind in the UK it came to an untimely end on 24 September 1911 when it was wrecked by wind during trials. Well-known ships built in Barrow include {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}, the Japanese flagship during the 1905 [[Russo-Japanese War]], the liner {{SS|Oriana|1959|6}} and the aircraft carriers {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} and {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}}. It should also be noted that there was a significant presence of Vickers' armament division in Barrow with the huge [[VSEL Heavy Engineering Workshop|Heavy Engineering Workshop]] on Michaelson Road supplying ammunition for the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]] throughout both world wars. World War 1 brought significant temporary migration as workers arrived to work in the munitions factory and shipyard, with the town's population reaching to an estimated peak of around 82,000 during the War.<ref name="THB" /> Thousands of local men fought abroad during World War I, 616 were ultimately killed in action.<ref name="ukniwm.org.uk">{{Cite web |last=Museums |first=Imperial War |title=Barrow In Furness Cenotaph |url=http://www.ukniwm.org.uk/server/show/conMemorial.2079/fromUkniwmSearch/1 |website=Imperial War Museums}}</ref>

During World War II, Barrow was a target for the [[Luftwaffe|German air force]] looking to disable the town's shipbuilding capabilities (see [[Barrow Blitz]]).<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 February 2005 |title=The Battle of Britain – Diary – 2 September 1940 |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bob1940/september2.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815202245/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bob1940/september2.html |archive-date=15 August 2007 |access-date=5 August 2007 |publisher=RAF}}</ref> The town suffered the most in a short period between April and May 1941. During the war, a local housewife, [[Nella Last]], was selected to write a diary of her experiences on the home front for the [[Mass-Observation]] project. Her memoirs were later adapted for television as ''[[Housewife, 49]]'' starring [[Victoria Wood]]. The difficulty in targeting bombs meant that the shipyards and steelworks were often missed, at the expense of the residential areas. Ultimately, 83 people were killed and 11,000 houses in the area were left damaged. To escape the heaviest bombardments, many people in the central areas left the town to sleep in hedgerows, with some being permanently evacuated.

2006 saw the construction of [[Barrow Offshore Wind Farm]], which has acted as a catalyst for further investment in offshore [[renewable energy]]. [[Ormonde Wind Farm]] and [[Walney Wind Farm]] followed in 2011, the latter of which became the largest offshore wind farm in the world.

==Geography==
Barrow is situated at the tip of the [[Furness]] peninsula on the north-western edge of [[Morecambe Bay]], south of the [[Duddon Estuary]] and east of the [[Irish Sea]]. [[Walney Island]], surrounds the peninsula's Irish Sea coast and is separated from Barrow by the narrow [[Walney Channel]]. Both Morecambe Bay and the Duddon Estuary are characterized by large areas of [[quicksand]] and fast-moving [[tidal bore]]s. Areas of [[sand dunes]] exist on coasts surrounding Barrow, particularly at [[Roanhead]] and [[North Walney]]. The town centre and major industrial areas sit on a fairly flat coastal shelf, with hillier ground rising to the east of the town, peaking at {{convert|94|m|ft|round=5}} at Yarlside. Barrow sits on soils deposited during the end of the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]], eroded from the mountains of the [[Lake District National Park]], {{convert|10|mi|km|round=5}} to the north-east. Barrow's soils are composed of glacial lake clay and [[glacial till]], while Walney is almost entirely made up of reworked glacial morraine.<ref>{{Cite web |last=May |first=VJ |title=Walney Island |url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2042.pdf |access-date=16 July 2015 |publisher=DEFRA}}</ref><ref name="ICE">{{Cite journal |last=Raison |first=CA |date=1999 |title=North Morecambe Terminal, Barrow: pile design for seismic conditions |url=http://www.raisonfosterassociates.co.uk/downloads/barrow-piling.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the ICE – Geotechnical Engineering |volume=137 |issue=3 |page=149±163 |doi=10.1680/gt.1999.370304 |access-date=16 July 2015}}</ref> Beneath these soils is a [[sandstone]] bedrock, from which many of the town's older buildings are constructed.<ref name="ICE" />

Barrow town centre is located to the north-east of the docks, with suburbs also extending to the north and east, as well as onto Walney. The towns of [[Dalton-in-Furness]] and [[Askam-in-Furness]] are the other sizable settlements of the [[Borough of Barrow-in-Furness]]. Barrow is the only major urban area in South Cumbria, with the nearest settlements of a similar size being [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and [[Morecambe]]. Other towns nearby include [[Ulverston]], [[Millom]], [[Grange-over-Sands]], [[Kendal]] and [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]].

===Islands===
{{Main|Islands of Furness}}
Most of the town is sheltered from the Irish Sea by [[Walney Island]], a <span style="white-space:nowrap">14&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(22.5&nbsp;km)</span> long island connected to the mainland by the [[Bascule bridge|bascule]] type [[Walney Bridge|Jubilee bridge]]. About 13,000 live on the isle's various settlements, mostly in [[Vickerstown]], which was built to house workers in the rapidly expanding shipyard. Another significant island which lay in the Walney Channel was [[Barrow Island (England)|Barrow Island]], but following the filling of the channel to create land for the shipyard it is now directly connected to the town. Other islands which lie close to Barrow are [[Piel Island]], whose [[Piel Castle|castle]] protected the harbour from marauding [[Scot]]s, [[Sheep Island (England)|Sheep Island]], [[Roa Island]] and [[Foulney Island]].

===Parks and open spaces===

There are numerous natural and managed public parks and open spaces within Barrow. Walney North and [[South Walney|South Nature Reserves]] are protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, as is [[Sandscale Haws]]. Formal woodland areas within the town include Hawcoat/Ormsgill Quarry, How Tun Woods, [[Abbot's Wood, Cumbria|Abbotswood]], Barrow Steel Works & Slag Bank and Sowerby Wood. The 45-Acre [[Barrow Park]] is the largest and most centrally located man-made park in the town with smaller parks including Channelside Haven, Hindpool Urban Park and Vickerstown Park. There are also 25 council-owned playgrounds and 15 allotments.

===Climate===
Barrow on the west coast of Great Britain has a [[temperate]] [[maritime climate]] owing to the North Atlantic current and tends to have milder winters than central and eastern parts of the country. The town lies in [[Hardiness zone]] 9 and has an average yearly temperature of 10.4&nbsp;°C.

==Economy==
[[File:Audacious Under Construction MOD 45155780.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Astute-class submarine|''Astute''-class]] submarine under-construction inside [[Devonshire Dock Hall]] in 2013]]
Historically Barrow's economy was dominated by the manufacturing sector, with the [[Barrow Hematite Steel Company]] and [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering]] being amongst the most important global companies in their respective fields during the 20th century. In the present day, manufacturing remains the largest employment sector in the town. [[BAE Systems]] is the single largest employer with around 9,500 employees, and one third of the workforce, as at 2020. However, like most of the UK, employment trends have greatly diversified since the 20th century and there are no other predominant employment sectors in Barrow.

===Shipyard and port===
Barrow has played a vital role in global ship and submarine construction for around 150 years. [[Ottoman submarine Abdül Hamid|Ottoman submarine ''Abdül Hamid'']] was built in the town in 1886 and became the first submarine in the world to fire a live torpedo underwater, while oil tanker ''British Admiral'' became the first British vessel to exceed 100,000 tonnes when launched in 1965. The vast majority of all current and former Royal Navy submarines were constructed in Barrow as well as numerous [[Royal Navy Fleet Flagship]]s.

[[File:HMS Invincible (R05).jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} pictured in Florida in 2004 is one of the most famous ships to have been built in Barrow]]
The [[BAE Systems Maritime – Submarines]] shipyard at Barrow is the largest in the UK by workforce ahead of [[BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships]] in [[Govan]]. It was expanded in 1986 by construction of a new covered assembly facility, the [[Devonshire Dock Hall]] (DDH), completed by [[Alfred McAlpine]], on land that was created by infilling part of the [[Devonshire Dock]] with 2.4 million tonnes of sand pumped from nearby Roosecote Sands.<ref>The Road to Success: Alfred McAlpine 1935 – 1985 page 174, Tony Gray, Rainbird Publishing, 1987</ref> DDH is the tallest building in Cumbria at 51&nbsp;m. With a length of {{convert|268|m|ft|abbr=on}}, width of {{convert|51|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an area of {{convert|25000|m2|sqft|}} it is one of the largest shipbuilding construction complex of its kind in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Taylor |first=Alison |title=Marine Marvel |url=http://www.thecqi.org/Documents/community/Special-Interest-Groups/Defence/Marine_marvel_jul_07.pdf |access-date=3 August 2015 |publisher=The Chartered Quality Institute}}</ref>

The DDH provides a controlled environment for ship and submarine assembly, and avoids the difficulties caused by building on the slope of traditional slipways. Outside the hall, a 24,300 tonne capacity shiplift allows completed vessels to be lowered into the water independently of the tide. Vessels can also be lifted out of the water and transferred to the hall.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=BAE Systems |title=Devonshire Dock Hall (DDH): One of the most advanced Shipbuilding Complexes in the World |url=http://www.baesystems.com/BAEProd/groups/public/documents/ss_asset/bae_subs_ddhdatasheet.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704111547/http://www.baesystems.com/BAEProd/groups/public/documents/ss_asset/bae_subs_ddhdatasheet.pdf |archive-date=4 July 2007 |access-date=3 June 2007}}</ref> The first use of the DDH was for construction of the {{sclass-|Vanguard|submarine|2}}s, and later vessels of the {{sclass-|Trafalgar|submarine|4}} were also built there.

The most recent surface vessels to be constructed in Barrow were {{sclass2-|Wave|tanker|2}} {{ship|RFA|Wave Knight|A389|6}} and {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|0}} amphibious assault ships {{HMS|Albion|L14|6}} and {{HMS|Bulwark|L15|6}} in the early 2000s when the shipyard was part of [[BAE Systems Marine]] division. It also undertook fitting out and commissioning of helicopter carrier {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}} in the mid-1990s after the ship was built by [[Kvaerner Govan]] in Glasgow.

[[Associated British Ports Holdings]] owns and operates the [[Port of Barrow]] which can berth vessels up to {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and with a draught of {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The four main docks include [[Buccleuch Dock]], [[Cavendish Dock]], [[Devonshire Dock]] and [[Ramsden Dock]], with the latter handling almost all of the port's cargo. Buccleuch and Devonshire Docks are utilised primarily by BAE Systems, while Cavendish Dock the largest by surface area is now a reservoir. Principal traffic includes the export of condensate by-product from the production of gas at the [[Rampside Gas Terminal]], wood pulp and locally quarried limestone which is exported to Scandinavia for use in the paper industry. The port, which has deep water access, also handles the shipment of nuclear fuels and radioactive waste for [[BNFL]]'s nearby [[Sellafield]] plant.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Port of Barrow |url=http://www.abports.co.uk/custinfo/ports/barrow.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122945/http://www.abports.co.uk/custinfo/ports/barrow.htm |archive-date=27 September 2007 |access-date=20 August 2007 |publisher=Associated British Ports}}</ref>

In 1899 Barrow Corporation built and operated the coal-fired [[Barrow-in-Furness power station]] in Buccleugh Street adjacent to the railway line. This eventually had a generating capacity of 23 MW; it was decommissioned in 1960.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Garrett|first=Frederick|title=Garcke's Manual of Electricity Supply vol. 56|publisher=Electrical Press|year=1959|isbn=|location=London|pages=A-30}}</ref>

[[Roosecote Power Station|Roosecote power station]] was a 120 MW coal-fired generating station commissioned in 1953,<ref name=":0" /> it was later converted to gas firing and closed in 1986. A 120 MW combined cycle gas turbine station was commissioned in 1991, it was closed in 2012.  From 2018 the site has been the location of 49 MW battery storage facility.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Battery storage plant to supply power|url=https://www.centricabusinesssolutions.com/case-study/battery-storage-plant-supply-power-thousands-homes|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9 October 2020|website=centrica}}</ref>

===Bus===
Bus services within the town are operated by [[Stagecoach North West]]. There is no specifically designated bus station, although many bus routes start and end near the town hall. The original bus station, since demolished, was known for its role in a 1970s television commercial for [[Chewits]] sweets.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Barrow Chewits ad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/content/articles/2006/03/30/cumbriaonfilm_chewits_feature.shtml |access-date=17 July 2007 |publisher=BBC Cumbria}}</ref> As well as local suburban and village services, longer-distance buses run to [[Millom]], [[Ulverston]], [[Bowness-on-Windermere|Bowness]], [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]] and [[Kendal]].

===Rail===
[[File:Barrow-in-Furness Station, Cumbria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Barrow-in-Furness railway station]] viewed from [[Abbey Road, Barrow-in-Furness|Abbey Road]]]]
[[Barrow-in-Furness railway station]] provides connections to [[Whitehaven]], [[Workington]] and [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] to the north, via the [[Cumbrian Coast Line]], and to [[Ulverston]], [[Grange-over-Sands]] and [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] to the east, via the [[Furness Line]] – both of which connect to the [[West Coast Mainline]]. Numerous daily trains run to [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester]]. The station handles over 600,000 passengers annually. Barrow has a second railway station, [[Roose railway station|Roose]], which serves [[Roose|the suburb of the same name]].

[[Furness Abbey railway station|Furness Abbey]], Barrow's third main line station, closed in 1950. There was also a station on [[Island Road railway station|Barrow Island]], for commuters between the shipyard and nearby towns served by the Furness Railway. This railway link was severed in 1966 when the famous cradle bridge across the docks was closed permanently for safety reasons. There were also stations at [[Piel railway station|Piel]], Rabbit Hill, [[Rampside railway station|Rampside]], [[Ramsden Dock railway station|Ramsden Dock]] and [[Barrow-in-Furness Strand railway station|Strand]].

Between 1885 and 1932, the [[Barrow-in-Furness Tramways Company]] operated a [[double-decker tram]] service over several miles, primarily around central Barrow, Barrow Island and Hindpool.

===Air===
[[Barrow/Walney Island Airport]] ([[IATA airport code]]: BWF, [[ICAO]]: EGNL) is a former commercial airport and [[Royal Air Force]] base currently owned by BAE Systems which operates two [[Beechcraft King Air|Beechkraft King Air]] B200 and one B250 aircraft which fly to various destinations across the UK every weekday, including Bristol, Glasgow, London and Manchester. The airport's runways take on a triangular form, the longest runway is almost {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. The airport was expanded by BAE in 2018 including the construction of a new terminal building, hangar and control tower.

[[Manchester Airport]] is the closest major airport, with direct links to Barrow railway station and about two hours away by road.

In 2018 a [[heliport]] was built on a site adjacent to Park Road, Ormsgill for energy firm [[Ørsted (company)|Ørsted]] and to support the offshore energy sector.

===Sea===
Despite being one of the UK's leading shipbuilding centres, the [[Associated British Ports]]' [[Port of Barrow]] is only a minor port. Historically, the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet]] and the [[Barrow Steam Navigation Company]] (a subsidiary of the Furness Railway and later [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]]) operated a number of steamers and passenger ferry services between Rampside and [[Ramsden Dock]] and [[Ardrossan]] (Scotland), [[Belfast]] (Northern Ireland), [[Blackpool]], [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] (Isle of Man), [[Fleetwood]] and [[Heysham]].<ref name="Ferry">{{Cite web |title=Go Anywhere On a Boat From Barrow |url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/memories/go-anywhere-on-a-boat-from-barrow-1.116441?referrerPath=home/2.4856 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112185109/http://www.nwemail.co.uk/memories/go-anywhere-on-a-boat-from-barrow-1.116441?referrerPath=home%2F2.4856 |archive-date=12 January 2015 |access-date=11 January 2015 |publisher=North West Evening Mail}}</ref> All services had ceased operation by the mid-20th century.

===Motor sports===

Barrow has staged [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] racing at three venues since the pioneer days in the late 1920s. The first track was at Holker Street. This venue had a revival for a short spell in the early to mid-1970s being utilised by the short-lived [[Barrow Bombers]]. In 1930 the sport moved to Little Park but this a somewhat hazy venue. The sport had a revival in 1978 at Park Avenue Industrial Estate but this was relatively short lived.

====Bike racing====

Barrow has produced a number of noteworthy motorcyclists throughout the years, such as Manx Grand Prix winner Eddie Crooks, TT Rider Dan Stewart, Speedway ace [[Adam Roynon]] and multiple British Sandtrack Champion John Pepper.

====Karting====

Barrow is one of Britain's few planned towns, and the spacious tree-lined avenues within the oldest parts of the town (including Central Barrow, Hindpool and Salthouse) are more akin to the layout of a much larger city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Destination guide for Barrow-in-Furness |url=http://www.enjoyengland.com/destinations/find/englands-northwest/cumbria/barrow-in-furness.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711101803/http://www.enjoyengland.com/destinations/find/englands-northwest/cumbria/barrow-in-furness.aspx |archive-date=11 July 2007 |access-date=8 August 2007 |publisher=Enjoy England}}</ref> The town centre is distinguished by its [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]] civic buildings, such as the [[Barrow-in-Furness Town Hall|Town Hall]], [[Barrow-in-Furness Main Public Library|Main Public Library]], former [[Nan Tait Centre|Technical School]], former [[Barrow-in-Furness Central Fire Station|Central Fire Station]], [[Salvation Army]] Building, [[Custom House, Barrow-in-Furness|Custom House]], [[National Westminster Bank, Barrow-in-Furness|National Westminster Bank]], [[The Duke of Edinburgh Hotel]], [[St. George's Church, Barrow-in-Furness|St. George's Church]], [[St. Mary of Furness Roman Catholic Church|St. Mary's RC Church]] and [[St. James' Church, Barrow-in-Furness|St. James' Church]]. Oppositely, several distinctive buildings have been demolished in Barrow since the mid-20th century as a result of neglect or war damage, amongst the most iconic are [[Abbot's Wood, Cumbria|Abbots Wood]], [[Barrow-in-Furness railway station|Barrow Central Railway Station]], [[Infield House]], [[St. George's Square, Barrow-in-Furness#North Lonsdale Hospital|North Lonsdale Hospital]], [[Scotch Buildings]] and the Waverley Hotel. Lancaster architects [[Sharpe, Paley and Austin]] were prolific throughout the development of Barrow. A number of Barrow's landmark buildings were constructed from locally sourced sandstone, evident from the high number of brown and red coloured stone buildings in the town. Similar materials were used in a number of local buildings in the early 20th century, and often accompanied by terracotta. There are also an increasing number of modern office buildings as well as the shipyard's construction halls which dominate much of Barrow's skyline. Despite much of Barrow having been constructed from the late 19th to mid 20th centuries, architectural styles vary greatly across the town from the [[Art Deco]] [[John Whinnerah Institute]] to the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine style]] [[St. John's Church, Barrow-in-Furness|St. John's Church]], [[Elizabethan architecture|Neo-Elizabethan]] [[Abbey House, Barrow-in-Furness|Abbey House]] and [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] [[Vickerstown]] estate.

Barrow has 8 [[Grade I listed buildings]], 15 [[Listed building|Grade II*]] and 249 [[Grade II]] buildings. The majority of Grade I listed buildings and structures are in and around the Furness Abbey complex while many Grade II* listed buildings in the town are 19th century tenements on Barrow Island including the [[Devonshire Buildings]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Listed Buildings |url=http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=2758 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030802/http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=2758 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |access-date=16 August 2007 |publisher=Barrow Borough Council}}</ref> There are a number of [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|Conservation Areas]] across Barrow named as such for their architectural or historical significance, they include [[Barrow Island, Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow Island]], [[Biggar, Cumbria|Biggar]], [[Central Barrow]], [[Furness Abbey]], [[North Scale]], North and South [[Vickerstown]] and [[St. George's Square, Barrow-in-Furness|St. George's Square]].<ref name="Conservation">{{Cite web |title=Conservation Areas in the Borough |url=http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=1696 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123213335/http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/Default.aspx?page=1696 |archive-date=23 November 2012 |access-date=9 June 2013 |publisher=Barrow Borough Council}}</ref> Historically Barrow's skyline was dominated by shipyard cranes and industrial chimneys, although little evidence of this remains in the present day with the last [[Crane (machine)#Hammerhead crane|hammerhead crane]] – the iconic yellow crane of [[Buccleuch Dock]] – being dismantled in 2011, despite calls for listing status like the smaller [[Titan Clydebank]] in Glasgow. The tallest building in Barrow is [[Devonshire Dock Hall]] at {{convert|51|m|ft|0}}. Also worth of note are the turbines of [[Ormonde Wind Farm]] located just off the coast of Barrow which stand at {{convert|152|m|ft|0}}.

In terms of housing, the majority of dwellings in Barrow are Victorian [[Terraced house|terraces]]. At 47.0% of local housing stock in 2011, the figure is much higher than England's average of 24.5%. 29.7% of dwellings are [[semi-detached]], 12.09% [[Single-family detached home|detached]] and 10.2% flats, maisonettes or apartments.<ref name="Housing">{{Cite web |title=Accommodation Type – Households, 2011 |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=6275013&c=barrow&d=13&e=7&g=6411253&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1365528720388&enc=1&dsFamilyId=2570 |access-date=9 April 2013 |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]}}</ref> Great variety in housing styles is a feature across central Barrow, Barrow Island, Hindpool, and Vickerstown.

In fictional works, Barrow and [[Vickerstown]] on [[Walney Island]] featured in children's show ''[[The Railway Series]]'', which developed into ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine]]'', as the point where the fictional [[Sodor (fictional island)|Island of Sodor]] connected to mainland Britain and the national rail network.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Thomas the Tank Engine books |url=http://www.storybookengland.com/authors.php?form_id=3413682892 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921151657/http://www.storybookengland.com/authors.php?form_id=3413682892 |archive-date=21 September 2007 |access-date=25 August 2007 |publisher=Storybook England |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A number of the [[Lake Poets]] have referred to locations in present day Barrow, with one notable example being [[William Wordsworth]]'s 1805 autobiographical poem ''[[The Prelude]]'' which describes his visits to Furness Abbey. The Portuguese poet [[Fernando Pessoa]] wrote a series of [[sonnet]]s called "Barrow-on-Furness" (sic). His "heteronym" [[Álvaro de Campos]] lived in Barrow when he was studying ship engineering, but Pessoa himself had never visited, and mistakenly assumed that "Furness" was the name of a river.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Álvaro de Campos's Geography |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/hispania--11/html/ |access-date=1 January 2012 |publisher=Hispania}}</ref> According to narrative exposition in Chapter five of [[Dorothy L.

===Dialect and accent===
{{main|Barrovian}}
Furness is unique within Cumbria and the local dialect and accent is fairly [[Lancashire dialect and accent|Lancashire]]-orientated. Until 1974 Furness was an [[exclave]] of Lancashire, however as with [[Liverpool]], for example, the ''Barrovian'' dialect has been influenced by large numbers of settlers from various regions. During the town's rapid growth from 1860 onward, thousands came to Barrow from [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Wales]] and elsewhere in northern England. As [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]] and [[Geordie]] dialects mingled in Barrow numerous more migrated from Lancashire and other parts of England which in effect created the noticeably [[Northern England English|Northern]] ''Barrovian'' dialect. In general the ''Barrovian'' accent tends to drop certain letters (including ''H'' and ''T'').
