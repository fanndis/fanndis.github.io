Chang was appointed to two separate terms as Premier, both under [[Chen Shui-bian]]. His appointment by then-President Chen in 2000 marked the first time a [[Democratic Progressive Party]] member occupied the premiership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem%3D33772%26ctNode%3D2584 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124705/http://www.gio.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=33772&ctNode=2584 |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}</ref>

As a founding member of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), he was a member of its Central Committee and Executive Member of its Central Standing Committee from 1986 to 2000.

==Early life==
Chang was born in 1938 in the city of Kagi (present-day [[Chiayi]]) when Taiwan (then Formosa) was still a [[Taiwan under Japanese control|colony of Japan]]. He earned his [[LL.B.]] at the  [[National Taiwan University]] in 1960. Chang joined the Kuomintang in 1970, but was expelled three year later for mounting a campaign for the Taipei City Council.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Chang Chün-hung: Profile of an imprisoned editor|journal=Taiwan Communiqué|date=March 1986|issue=24|page=18|url=http://www.taiwandc.org/twcom/tc24-int.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018|issn=1027-3999}}</ref> As a [[lawyer]], he defended the victims of the [[Kaohsiung Incident]] in 1980. From 1982 to 1986 he was President of the Kaohsiung Chapter of the [[YMCA]].

==Political career==
He was a member of the [[Legislative Yuan]] from 1983 to 2000. As a legislator, he was Executive Director and General Convener of the DPP Caucus from 1987 to 1988, 1990, and 1998 to 1999. He was Convener of the Judiciary Committee in 1991, of the Home and Border Affairs Committee in 92, and of the Transportation and Communications Committee in 95.

In 1994, Chang stood as the Democratic Progressive Party candidate to run for the mayor of [[Kaohsiung]], but was defeated by the Kuomintang incumbent [[Wu Den-yih]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yu|first1=Susan|title=KMT takes two top seats; DPP wins in Taipei|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=60341&ctNode=122|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=Taiwan Today|date=9 December 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110173155/http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=60341&ctNode=122|archivedate=10 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Yu|first1=Susan|title=Local focus in Kaohsiung debate|url=http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=59727&ctNode=451|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=Taiwan Today|date=4 November 1994|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110173012/http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=59727&ctNode=451|archivedate=10 November 2016}}</ref>

In the [[2000 ROC presidential election|2000 presidential election]] he was General Manager of [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s campaign. In the Chen administration, he served as Secretary-General of the [[President of the Republic of China|Office of the President]] in 2000, Vice Premier of the ROC in 2000 and [[Premier of the Republic of China]] from October 6, 2000 to February 1, 2002.

Since 2002, he has been Secretary General of the Democratic Progressive Party and a Senior Adviser in the Office of the President.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lin|first1=Mei-chun|title=Chen clocks in as DPP chairman|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2002/07/23/0000149335|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=23 July 2002}}</ref>

He ran in the [[2004 ROC legislative election|2004 Legislative Yuan election]] as fourth on the DPP's nationwide slate and was easily elected but resigned (as he promised to do during the campaign) since the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] failed to win a majority. He also tendered his resignation as Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party to take responsibility for the defeat.

Chang was appointed as the chairman of the [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] in 2005 after the death of the former chairman [[Koo Chen-fu]]. With the resignation of [[Su Tseng-chang]] as Premier on May 12, 2007, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Chen Shui-bian]] nominated Chang to fill the post of Premier a second time effective May 21, and [[Hung Chi-chang]] succeeded Chang as the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation.  Su's resignation and Chang's second appointment as Premier marked the sixth premier that Chen Shui-bian has appointed during his two terms as President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/eastasia/view/276152/1/.html |title=404 |website=Channel NewsAsia |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517035215/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/eastasia/view/276152/1/.html |archivedate=2007-05-17 }}</ref>

==Family life==
Chang maintained a long-term marriage-like relationship with a paramour while remaining legally married to his first wife, Hsu Jui-ying. After his first term as Premier, he and Hsu divorced, and in 2007 he married his paramour (Chu A-ying) as his second wife.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Low|first1=Stephanie|title=Public split on politicians' affairs|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2002/09/15/0000168106|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=15 September 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ko|first1=Shu-ling|title=Chang apologizes to his former wife|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2002/04/11/0000131390|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=11 April 2002}}</ref>
