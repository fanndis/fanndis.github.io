'''New York''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Northeastern United States]]. New York was one of the original [[thirteen colonies]] that formed the United States.

The 27th largest U.S. state in land area, New York has a diverse geography. The state is bordered by [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] to the south and [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Vermont]] to the east. The state has a [[Maritime boundary|maritime border]] with [[Rhode Island]], east of [[Long Island]], as well as an [[Canada–United States border|international border]] with the [[Canadian provinces]] of [[Quebec]] to the north and [[Ontario]] to the northwest. The southern part of the state is in the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] and includes Long Island and several smaller associated islands, as well as New York City and the lower [[Hudson River Valley]]. The large [[Upstate New York]] region comprises several ranges of the wider [[Appalachian Mountains]], and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] in the [[North Country (New York)|northeastern lobe]] of the state. The north–south Hudson River Valley and the east–west [[Mohawk River]] Valley bisect these more mountainous regions. [[Western New York]] is considered part of the [[Great Lakes region]] and borders on [[Lake Ontario]], [[Lake Erie]], and [[Niagara Falls]]. The central part of the state is dominated by the [[Finger Lakes]], a popular vacation and tourist destination.

New York had been inhabited by tribes of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] and [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for several hundred years by the time the earliest Europeans came to New York. [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] and [[Jesuit missionaries]] arrived southward from [[Montreal]] for trade and [[proselytism|proselytizing]]. In 1609, the region was visited by [[Henry Hudson]] sailing for the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] built [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] in 1614 at the confluence of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]] rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed. The Dutch soon also settled [[New Amsterdam]] and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the multicultural colony of [[New Netherland]], a center of trade and immigration. [[Kingdom of England|England]] seized the colony from the Dutch in 1664. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783), a group of colonists of the [[Province of New York]] attempted to take control of the British colony and eventually succeeded in establishing independence. In the 19th century, New York's development of the interior, beginning with the [[Erie Canal]], gave it incomparable advantages over other regions of the east coast and built its political and cultural ascendancy.<ref name=Roberts>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/nyregion/history-of-the-erie-canal.html|title=200 Years Ago, Erie Canal Got Its Start as Just a 'Ditch' |first=Sam|last=Roberts|date=June 26, 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=July 25, 2017}}</ref>

{{Main|History of New York (state)}}

===Native American history===

[[File:Early Localization Native Americans NY.svg|thumb|New York was dominated by [[Iroquoian]] (purple) and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] (pink) [[tribe (Native American)|tribe]]s.|alt=Map of New York showing Algonquian tribes in the eastern and southern portions and Iroquoian tribes to the western and northern portions.]]

The tribes in what is now New York were predominantly [[Haudenosaunee]] and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]. [[Long Island]] was divided roughly in half between the [[Wampanoag]] and [[Lenape]]. The Lenape also controlled most of the region surrounding [[New York Harbor]]. North of the Lenape was a third Algonquian nation, the [[Mohican]]s. Starting north of them, from east to west, were three Iroquoian nations: the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], the original [[Iroquois]] and the [[Petun]]. South of them, divided roughly along [[Appalachia]], were the [[Susquehannock]] and the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Ha-La/Iroquois-Confederacy.html|title=Iroquois Confederacy—History, Relations with non-native americans, Key issues|website=www.everyculture.com|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/environmental_center/sunbury/website/HistoryofSusquehannockIndians.shtml|title=Susquehannock Indians|website=www.departments.bucknell.edu|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/erie-tribe.htm|title=Erie Tribe—Access Genealogy|date=July 9, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyandot.org/rb10.htm|title='PETUN' AND THE PETUNS|first=J.|last=English|website=www.wyandot.org|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/mahican-tribe.htm|title=Mahican Tribe—Access Genealogy|date=July 9, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>Barron, Donna. "The Long Island Indians & Their New England Ancestors". 2006</ref>

Many of the Wampanoag and Mohican peoples were caught up in [[King Philip's War]], a joint effort of many [[New England]] tribes to push Europeans off their land. After the death of their leader, Chief Philip [[Metacomet]], most of those peoples fled inland, splitting into the [[Abenaki]] and the [[Schaghticoke people|Schaghticoke]]. Many of the Mohicans remained in the region until the 1800s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/king-philips-war|title=King Philip's War—Native American History|website=History.com|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref> however, a small group known as the Ouabano migrated southwest into [[Protohistory of West Virginia|West Virginia]] at an earlier time. They may have merged with the Shawnee.<ref>John Heckewelder (Loskiel): Conoys, Ganawese, etc. explains Charles A. Hanna (Vol II, 1911:96, Ganeiens-gaa, Margry, i., 529; ii., 142–43,) using La Salle's letter of August 22, 1681 Fort Saint Louis (Illinois) mentioning "Ohio tribes" for extrapolation.</ref><ref>Hanna 1911:158</ref>

The Mohawk and Susquehannock were the most [[militarism|militaristic]]. Trying to corner trade with the Europeans, they targeted other tribes. The Mohawk were also known for refusing white settlement on their land and banishing any of their people who converted to [[Christianity]]. They posed a major threat to the Abenaki and Mohicans, while the Susquehannock briefly conquered the Lenape in the 1600s. The most devastating event of the century, however, was the [[Beaver Wars]]. From approximately 1640–1680, Iroquoian peoples waged campaigns which extended from modern-day Michigan to Virginia against Algonquian and Siouan tribes, as well as each other. The aim was to control more land for animal trapping, a career most natives had turned to in hopes of trading with whites first. This completely changed the ethnography of the region, and most large game was hunted out before whites ever fully explored the land. Still, afterward, the Iroquois Confederacy offered shelter to refugees of the [[Mascouten]], Erie, [[Neutral Nation|Chonnonton]], [[Tutelo]], [[Saponi]], and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] nations. In the 1700s, they would also merge with the Mohawk during the [[French-Indian War]] and take in the remaining Susquehannock of Pennsylvania after they were decimated in war.<ref>Editor: Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., by The editors of American Heritage Magazine (1961). "The American Heritage Book of Indians" pages 188–219. American Heritage Publishing Co., Inc</ref> Most of these other groups blended in until they ceased to exist. Then, after the Revolution, a large group of them split off and returned to Ohio, becoming known as the [[Mingo]] Seneca. The current six tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy are the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Tuscarora and Mohawk. The Iroquois fought for both sides during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]; afterwards many pro-British Iroquois migrated to Canada. Today, the Iroquois still live in several reservations in upstate New York.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical Timeline |url=https://www.oneidaindiannation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Historical-Timeline-2019.pdf |publisher=Oneida Nation |accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Seneca Nation |url=https://sni.org/ |accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.warpaths2peacepipes.com/the-indian-wars/beaver-wars.htm|title=Beaver Wars ***|website=www.warpaths2peacepipes.com|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://genealogytrails.com/ohio/early_indian_migration_in_ohio.htm|title=Early Indian Migration in Ohio|website=genealogytrails.com|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the Lenape formed a close relationship with [[William Penn]]. However, upon Penn's death, his sons managed to take over much of their lands and banish them to Ohio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delawaretribe.org/blog/2013/06/27/the-walking-purchase/|title=Official Site of the Delaware Tribe of Indians » The Walking Purchase|website=delawaretribe.org|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref> When the U.S. drafted the [[Indian Removal Act]], the Lenape were further moved to Missouri, whereas their cousins, the Mohicans, were sent to Wisconsin.

Also, in 1778, the United States relocated the [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]] from the Delmarva Peninsula to the former Iroquois lands south of Lake Ontario, though they did not stay long. Mostly, they chose to migrate into Canada and merge with the Iroquois, although some moved west and merged with the Lenape.<ref>Pritzker 441</ref>

In 1524, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], an Italian explorer in the service of the [[French crown]], explored the Atlantic coast of North America between the [[Carolinas]] and [[Newfoundland]], including [[New York Harbor]] and [[Narragansett Bay]]. On April 17, 1524, Verrazzano entered [[New York Bay]], by way of the strait now called [[the Narrows]] into the northern bay which he named Santa Margherita, in honor of the King of France's [[Marguerite de Navarre|sister]]. Verrazzano described it as "a vast coastline with a deep delta in which every kind of ship could pass" and he adds: "that it extends inland for a league and opens up to form a beautiful lake. This vast sheet of water swarmed with native boats." He landed on the tip of Manhattan and possibly on the furthest point of Long Island. Verrazzano's stay was interrupted by a storm which pushed him north towards [[Martha's Vineyard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verrazzano.org/en/index2.php?c=viaggioscoperte|title=Centro Studi Storici Verrazzano—Official web site|date=April 15, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=March 3, 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415202640/http://www.verrazzano.org/en/index2.php?c=viaggioscoperte|archivedate=April 15, 2009}}</ref>

In 1540, French traders from New France built a chateau on [[Castle Island (New York)|Castle Island]], within present-day Albany; it was abandoned the following year due to flooding. In 1614, the Dutch, under the command of Hendrick Corstiaensen, rebuilt the French [[chateau]], which they called [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]]. Fort Nassau was the first Dutch settlement in North America, and was located along the Hudson River, also within present-day Albany. The small fort served as a trading post and warehouse. Located on the Hudson River flood plain, the rudimentary "fort" was washed away by flooding in 1617,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/na/castle.html|title=Castle Island|publisher=}}</ref> and abandoned for good after [[Fort Orange|Fort Orange (New Netherland)]] was built nearby in 1623.<ref name=Chronicles>{{cite book | title = Albany Chronicles: A History of the City Arranged Chronologically | publisher = J.B.

Henry Hudson's 1609 voyage marked the beginning of European involvement with the area. Sailing for the [[Dutch East India Company]] and looking for a passage to Asia, he entered the [[Upper New York Bay]] on September 11 of that year.<ref>[http://blog.insidetheapple.net/2008/09/new-yorks-many-911-anniversaries-staten.html Nevius, Michelle and James, "New York's many 9/11 anniversaries: the Staten Island Peace Conference"], ''Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City'', September 8, 2008.

During the 17th century, Dutch [[trading post]]s established for the trade of pelts from the [[Lenape]], [[Iroquois]], and other tribes were founded in the colony of [[New Netherland]]. The first of these trading posts were [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] (1614, near present-day [[Albany, New York|Albany]]); [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] (1624, on the [[Hudson River]] just south of the current city of Albany and created to replace Fort Nassau), developing into settlement [[Beverwijck]] (1647), and into what became Albany; [[Fort Amsterdam]] (1625, to develop into the town [[New Amsterdam]] which is present-day New York City); and Esopus, (1653, now [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]]). The success of the [[patroon]]ship of [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaerswyck]] (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony. The English captured the colony during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] and governed it as the [[Province of New York]]. The city of New York was recaptured by the Dutch in 1673 during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] (1672–1674) and renamed New Orange. It was returned to the English under the terms of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] a year later.<ref>Scheltema, Gajus and Westerhuijs, Heleen (eds.), ''Exploring Historic Dutch New York''.

The [[Sons of Liberty]] were organized in [[New York City]] during the 1760s, largely in response to the oppressive [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in 1765. The [[Stamp Act Congress]] met in the city on October 19 of that year, composed of representatives from across the [[Thirteen Colonies]] who set the stage for the [[Continental Congress]] to follow. The Stamp Act Congress resulted in the [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]], which was the first written expression by representatives of the Americans of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. This included the right to [[No taxation without representation|representative government]]. At the same time, given strong commercial, personal and sentimental links to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], many New York residents were [[Loyalist]]s. The [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga]] provided the [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|cannon and gunpowder]] necessary to force a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] withdrawal from the [[Siege of Boston]] in 1775.

New York was the only colony [[United States Declaration of Independence#Draft and adoption|not to vote for independence]], as the delegates were not authorized to do so. New York then endorsed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 9, 1776.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/minisites/fourthofjuly/viewPage?pageId=690 |title=Declaration of Independence |publisher=history.com |accessdate=April 10, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409165028/http://www.history.com/minisites/fourthofjuly/viewPage%3FpageId%3D690 |archivedate=April 9, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution]] was framed by a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|convention]] which assembled at [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] on July 10, 1776, and after repeated adjournments and changes of location, finished its work at [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]] on Sunday evening, April 20, 1777, when the [[Constitution of New York, 1777|new constitution]] drafted by [[John Jay]] was adopted with but one dissenting vote. It was not submitted to the people for ratification. On July 30, 1777, [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] was inaugurated as the first [[Governor of New York]] at Kingston.

About a third of the battles of the [[American Revolutionary War]] took place in New York; the first major one (and largest of the entire war) was the [[Battle of Long Island]], a.k.a. ''Battle of Brooklyn'', in August 1776. After their victory, the British occupied New York City, making it their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict, and consequently the focus of General [[George Washington]]'s [[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]]. On the notorious British [[HMS Jersey (1736)|prison ships]] of [[Wallabout Bay]], more American combatants died of intentional neglect than were killed in combat in every battle of the war combined. Both sides of combatants lost more soldiers to disease than to outright wounds. The first of two major British armies were captured by the [[Continental Army]] at the [[Battles of Saratoga|Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, a success that influenced [[France]] to ally with the revolutionaries.The state constitution was enacted in 1777. New York became the 11th state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], on July 26, 1788.

In an attempt to retain their [[sovereign nation|sovereignty]] and remain an independent nation positioned between the new United States and British North America, four of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Nations]] fought on the side of the British; only the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and their dependents, the Tuscarora, allied themselves with the Americans.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/dividedgroundind0000tayl|url-access=registration|author=Alan Taylor|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-45471-7|year=2006}}</ref> In retaliation for attacks on the frontier led by [[Joseph Brant]] and Loyalist [[Mohawk people|Mohawk forces]], the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779 destroyed nearly 50 Iroquois villages, adjacent croplands and winter stores, forcing many refugees to British-held Niagara.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sullivan/Clinton Interactive Map Set |url=http://www.sullivanclinton.com/mapset/shell.swf |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>

As allies of the British, the Iroquois were forced out of New York, although they had not been part of treaty negotiations. They resettled in Canada after the war and were given land grants by the Crown. In the treaty settlement, the British ceded most Indian lands to the new United States. Because New York made treaty with the Iroquois without getting Congressional approval, some of the land purchases have been subject to land claim suits since the late 20th century by the federally recognized tribes. New York put up more than {{convert|5|e6acre|km2}} of former Iroquois territory for sale in the years after the Revolutionary War, leading to rapid development in upstate New York.<ref>Chen, David W.

New York City was the national capital under the [[Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], the first national government. That organization was found to be insufficient, and prominent New Yorker [[Alexander Hamilton]] advocated a new government that would include an executive, national courts, and the power to tax. Hamilton led the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)]] that called for the [[Philadelphia Convention]], which drafted the United States Constitution, in which he also took part. The new government was to be a strong [[Federation|federal]] national government to replace the relatively weaker [[confederation]] of individual states. Following heated debate, which included the publication of the now quintessential constitutional interpretation—''[[The Federalist Papers]]''—as a series of installments in New York City newspapers, New York was the 11th state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], on July 26, 1788.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/rat_ny.html|title=New York's Ratification |publisher=The U.S. Constitution Online |accessdate=April 10, 2008}}</ref> New York remained the national capital under the new constitution until 1790,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KxW_BKtCjqkC&q=New+York+remained+the+national+capital+under+the+new+constitution+until+1790&pg=PT44|title=Transforming America: Perspectives on U.S. Immigration [3 volumes]: Perspectives on U.S. Immigration|last=LeMay|first=Michael C.|date=December 10, 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313396441|language=en}}</ref> and was the site of the inauguration of President George Washington,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/inaugural.html|title=George Washington's First Inaugrual Address: Primary Documents of American History (Virtual Programs & Services, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|others=Washington, George|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> the drafting of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], and the first session of the [[United States Supreme Court]].

Both the Dutch and the British imported African slaves as laborers to the city and colony; New York had the second-highest population of slaves after Charleston, South Carolina. Slavery was extensive in New York City and some agricultural areas. The state passed a law for the gradual [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] soon after the Revolutionary War, but the last slave in New York was not freed until 1827.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/2015/04/24/new-york-city-would-really-rather-not-talk-about-its-slavery-loving-past-321714.html|title=New York City Would Really Rather Not Talk About Its Slavery-Loving Past|date=April 15, 2015|work=Newsweek|access-date=July 30, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Transportation in western New York was by expensive wagons on muddy roads before canals opened up the rich farm lands to long-distance traffic. Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] promoted the [[Erie Canal]], which connected New York City to the [[Great Lakes]] by the [[Hudson River]], the new canal, and the rivers and lakes. Work commenced in 1817, and the [[Erie Canal]] opened in 1825. [[Packet boat]]s pulled by horses on tow paths traveled slowly over the canal carrying passengers and freight.<ref name=ErieCanal>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyscanals.gov/cculture/history/|title=The Erie Canal: A Brief History |publisher=New York State Canals |accessdate=April 10, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124145509/http://www.nyscanals.gov/cculture/history/ |archivedate=January 24, 2010}}</ref> Farm products came in from the Midwest, and finished manufactured goods moved west. It was an engineering marvel which opened up vast areas of New York to commerce and settlement. It enabled Great Lakes port cities such as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to grow and prosper. It also connected the burgeoning agricultural production of the Midwest and shipping on the Great Lakes, with the port of New York City. Improving transportation, it enabled additional population migration to territories west of New York. After 1850, railroads largely replaced the canal.<ref>Peter L. Bernstein, ''Wedding of the waters: The Erie Canal and the making of a great nation'' (2005).</ref>

New York City was a major [[port|ocean port]] and had extensive traffic importing cotton from the [[American South|South]] and exporting manufacturing goods. Nearly half of the state's exports were related to cotton. Southern cotton factors, planters and bankers visited so often that they had favorite hotels.<ref>Robert Greenhalgh Albion, ''The rise of New York port (1815–1860)'' (1939).</ref> At the same time, activism for [[abolitionism]] was strong upstate, where some communities provided stops on the [[Underground Railroad]]. Upstate, and New York City, gave strong support for the [[American Civil War]], in terms of finances, volunteer soldiers, and supplies. The state provided more than 370,000 soldiers to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies. Over 53,000 New Yorkers died in service, roughly one of every seven who served. However, Irish draft riots in 1862 were a significant embarrassment.<ref>Ernest A.

===Immigration===

{{Further|Ellis Island}}
[[File:Ellis Island immigration footage.ogg|thumb|upright|Scenes at the Immigration Depot and a nearby dock on Ellis Island|170x170px]]

Since the early 19th century, New York City has been the largest [[port of entry]] for [[Immigration to the United States|legal immigration into the United States]]. In the United States, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until 1890. Prior to this time, the matter was delegated to the individual states, then via contract between the states and the federal government. Most immigrants to New York would disembark at the bustling docks along the Hudson and [[East River]]s, in the eventual [[Lower Manhattan]]. On May 4, 1847, the [[New York State Legislature]] created the Board of Commissioners of Immigration to regulate immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110063703/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archivedate=November 10, 2013 |title=Castle Garden as An Immigrant Depot:1855–1890 |publisher=National Park Service|date= |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

The first permanent immigration depot in New York was established in 1855 at [[Castle Clinton|Castle Garden]], a converted [[War of 1812]] era fort located within what is now [[Battery Park]], at the tip of Lower Manhattan. The first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from [[quarantine]]. Castle Garden served as New York's immigrant depot until it closed on April 18, 1890, when the federal government assumed control over immigration. During that period, more than eight million immigrants passed through its doors (two of every three U.S. immigrants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm |title=Castle Clinton |publisher=National Park Service|date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

When the federal government assumed control, it established the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|Bureau of Immigration]], which chose the three-acre Ellis Island in [[Upper New York Bay|Upper New York Harbor]] for an entry depot. Already federally controlled, the island had served as an ammunition depot. It was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to New York City and the rail lines of [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], via a short ferry ride. While the island was being developed and expanded via [[land reclamation]], the federal government operated a temporary depot at the Barge Office at the Battery.<ref>Vincent J. Cannato: ''American Passage: The History of Ellis Island''. p.50: Harper Collins (2009) {{ISBN|0060742739}}</ref>

Ellis Island opened on January 1, 1892, and operated as a central immigration center until the [[Immigration Act of 1924|National Origins Act]] was passed in 1924, reducing immigration. After that date, the only immigrants to pass through were [[displaced persons]] or war [[refugees]]. The island ceased all immigration processing on November 12, 1954, when the last person detained on the island, [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] seaman Arne Peterssen, was released. He had overstayed his shore leave and left on the 10:15{{nbs}}a.m. Manhattan-bound ferry to return to his ship.

More than twelve million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954. More than a hundred million Americans across the United States can trace their [[ancestry]] to these immigrants.

Ellis Island was the subject of a contentious and long-running border and jurisdictional dispute between New York State and the State of New Jersey, as both claimed it. The issue was settled in 1998 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] which ruled that the original {{convert|3.3|acre|adj=on}} island was New York State territory and that the balance of the {{convert|27.5|acres|0|abbr=on}} added after 1834 by landfill was in New Jersey.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/nyregion/ellis-island-verdict-ruling-high-court-gives-new-jersey-most-ellis-island.html|title=The Ellis Island Verdict: The Ruling|author=Linda Greenhouse|date=May 27, 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> The island was added to the [[National Park Service]] system in May 1965 by President [[Lyndon B.

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of New York (state)}}
[[File:New York state geographic map-en.svg|thumb|left|New York is bordered by five U.S. states, two [[Great Lakes]], and the Canadian provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].|alt=A topographic map of the state of New York, with urban and geographic features marked]]

The state of New York covers {{convert|54555|sqmi|km2}} and ranks as the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|27th largest state by size]].<ref name=area>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108355.html |title=Land and Water Area of States (2000) |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=April 11, 2008}}</ref> The highest elevation in New York is [[Mount Marcy]] in the Adirondacks, at {{convert|5,344|ft|m|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[above sea level]]; while the state's lowest point is at sea level, on the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=usgs>{{cite web |date=April 29, 2005 |url=http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201060818/http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |archivedate=February 1, 2009 |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=November 6, 2006}}</ref>

In contrast with New York City's urban landscape, the vast majority of the state's geographic area is dominated by [[meadow]]s, [[forest]]s, rivers, farms, mountains, and lakes. Most of the southern part of the state rests on the [[Allegheny Plateau]], which extends from the [[southeastern United States]] to the [[Catskill Mountains]]; the section in New York State is known as the [[Southern Tier]]. The rugged [[Adirondack Mountains]], with vast tracts of wilderness, lie west of the [[Lake Champlain Valley]]. The [[Great Appalachian Valley]] dominates eastern New York and contains the Lake Champlain Valley as its northern half and the [[Hudson Valley]] as its southern half within the state. The [[Tug Hill]] region arises as a [[cuesta]] east of [[Lake Ontario]].<ref name=NYS_THComm_Region>{{cite web |url=http://www.tughill.org/tug-hill-region/ |title=Tug Hill Region |publisher=New York State Tug Hill Commission |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>

[[Upstate New York|''Upstate'']] and [[Downstate New York|''downstate'']] are often used informally to distinguish New York City or its greater metropolitan area from the rest of New York State. The placement of a boundary between the two is a matter of great contention.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Encyclopedia of New York State| page = 1619| isbn = 978-0-8156-0808-0| year = 2005| publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]| editor = Eisenstadt, Peter}}</ref> Unofficial and loosely defined regions of Upstate New York include the Southern Tier, which often includes the counties along the border with Pennsylvania,<ref>{{cite book| title = The Encyclopedia of New York State| page = 1437| isbn = 978-0-8156-0808-0| year = 2005| publisher=Syracuse University Press| editor = Eisenstadt, Peter}}</ref> and the [[North Country (New York)|North Country]], which can mean anything from the strip along the Canada–U.S. border to everything north of the Mohawk River.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Encyclopedia of New York State| isbn = 978-0-8156-0808-0| year = 2005| publisher=Syracuse University Press| editor = Eisenstadt, Peter}}</ref>

===Water===
====Borders====

[[File:LI region DEM-2.jpg|thumb|right|Enveloped by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Long Island Sound]], [[New York City]] and [[Long Island]] alone are home to about eleven million residents conjointly.]]

Of New York State's total area, 13.6% consists of water.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/wetstates.html |title=Area of each state that is water |website=water.usgs.gov |access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref> Much of New York's boundaries are in water, as is true for New York City: four of its [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]] are situated on three islands at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]]: [[Manhattan|Manhattan Island]]; [[Staten Island]]; and [[Long Island]], which contains [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]] at its western end. The state's borders include a water boundary in (clockwise from the west) two [[Great Lakes]] ([[Lake Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario]], which are connected by the [[Niagara River]]); the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]], with New York and Ontario sharing the [[Thousand Islands]] [[archipelago]] within the Saint Lawrence River, while most of its border with Quebec is on land; it shares [[Lake Champlain]] with the [[New England]] state of [[Vermont]]; the New England state of [[Massachusetts]] has mostly a land border; New York extends into [[Long Island Sound]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], sharing a water border with [[Rhode Island]], while [[Connecticut]] has land and sea borders. Except for areas near the [[New York Harbor]] and the Upper [[Delaware River]], New York has a mostly land border with two [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] states, [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. New York is the only state that includes within its borders parts of the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean.

====Drainage====

The [[Hudson River]] begins near [[Lake Tear of the Clouds]] and flows south through the eastern part of the state, without draining Lakes [[Lake George (New York)|George]] or [[Lake Champlain|Champlain]]. Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain, whose northern end extends into Canada, where it drains into the [[Richelieu River]] and then ultimately the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The western section of the state is drained by the [[Allegheny River]] and rivers of the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and [[Delaware River]] systems. [[Niagara Falls]] is shared between New York and Ontario as it flows on the Niagara River from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. The Delaware River Basin Compact, signed in 1961 by New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, [[Delaware]], and the federal government, regulates the utilization of water of the Delaware system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/compact.pdf|title=Delaware River Basin Commission|publisher=The State of New Jersey|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref>

===Climate===

{{Main|Climate of New York}}
[[File:LakeEffectSnowBuffalo101206.gif|thumb|[[Lake-effect snow]] is a major contributor to heavy snowfall totals in [[western New York]], including the [[Tug Hill]] region.]]

In general, New York has a [[humid continental climate]], though under the [[Köppen climate classification]], New York City has a [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref name=NYClimate>{{cite web|url=http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412104922/http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|archivedate=April 12, 2008|title=Climate of New York|publisher=New York State Climate Office—Cornell University|accessdate=April 10, 2008}}</ref> Weather in New York is heavily influenced by two continental air masses: a warm, humid one from the southwest and a cold, dry one from the northwest. Downstate New York, comprising New York City, Long Island, and lower portions of the Hudson Valley, has rather hot summers with some periods of high humidity and cold, damp winters which are relatively mild compared to temperatures in Upstate New York due to the downstate region's lower elevation, proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, and relatively lower [[latitude]]. Upstate New York experiences warm summers, marred by only occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions, with long and cold winters. Western New York, particularly the Tug Hill region, receives heavy [[lake-effect snow]]s, especially during the earlier portions of winter, before the surface of Lake Ontario itself is covered by ice. The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks, Catskills, and at higher elevations of the Southern Tier. Buffalo and its metropolitan area are described as climate change havens for their weather pattern in Western New York.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Will Buffalo Become a Climate Change Haven?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-05/the-consequences-of-being-a-climate-refuge-city|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-27|website=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=García|first=Beatriz|date=2019-12-16|title=Why Buffalo is the best U.S. city for climate refugees|url=https://aldianews.com/articles/cultura/environment/why-buffalo-best-us-city-climate-refugees/57108|access-date=2020-06-27|website=AL DÍA News|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Move to Buffalo?

Summer daytime temperatures range from the high 70s to low 80s (25 to 28{{nbs}}°C), over most of the state. In the majority of winter seasons, a temperature of {{convert|-13|F|C|0}} or lower can be expected in the northern highlands (Northern Plateau) and {{convert|5|F|C|0}} or colder in the southwestern and east-central highlands of the Southern Tier.

New York State ranks 46th among the 50 states in the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es generated per person. This relative [[efficient energy use|efficient energy usage]] is primarily due to the dense, compact settlement in the New York City metropolitan area, and the high rate of [[Public transport|mass transit]] use in this area and between major cities.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Breath of Fresh New York Air|author=The New York Post|date=June 3, 2007|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032007/news/regionalnews/a_breath_of_fresh_n_y__air_regionalnews_.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606103459/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032007/news/regionalnews/a_breath_of_fresh_n_y__air_regionalnews_.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref> The main sources of greenhouse gases per the state government are transportation, buildings, electricity generation, waste, refrigerants, and agriculture.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions—NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/99223.html|access-date=2020-07-02|website=www.dec.ny.gov}}</ref> In 2019 the state pledged to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=McKinley|first1=Jesse|last2=Plumer|first2=Brad|date=2019-06-18|title=New York to Approve One of the World's Most Ambitious Climate Plans|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/nyregion/greenhouse-gases-ny.html|access-date=2020-07-02|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

{{multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal|image1=Map of New York Economic Regions.svg|caption1=Economic regions|image2=New York State Department Economic Development Regions.svg|caption2=Tourism regions}}

Due to its long history, New York has several overlapping and often conflicting definitions of regions within the state. The regions are also not fully definable due to colloquial use of regional labels. The New York State Department of Economic Development provides two distinct definitions of these regions. It divides the state into ten economic regions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pad.human.cornell.edu/census2010/reports/2010%20race%20age%20sex%20New%20York.pdf |title=Age/sex/race in New York State: Based on Census 2010 |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> which approximately correspond to terminology used by residents:

The State of New York is well represented in the [[National Park Service|National Park System]] with 22 [[national park]]s, which received 16,349,381 visitors in 2011. In addition, there are four [[National Heritage Area]]s, 27 [[National Natural Landmark]]s, 262 [[National Historic Landmark]]s, and 5,379 listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].
* [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]] includes [[Ellis Island]] and the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The statue, designed by [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi|Frédéric Bartholdi]] and formally named ''Liberty Enlightening the World'', was a gift from [[France]] to the United States to mark the Centennial of the [[Declaration of Independence of the United States|American Declaration of Independence]]; it was dedicated in New York Harbor on October 28, 1886. It has since become an icon of the United States and the concepts of democracy and freedom.
* [[African Burial Ground National Monument]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] is the only National Monument dedicated to Americans of African ancestry.

===Administrative divisions===

{{Main|Administrative divisions of New York}}
[[File:New York Counties.svg|thumb|right|Map of the counties in New York]]

New York is divided into 62 [[County (United States)|counties]]. Aside from the five counties of New York City, each of these counties is subdivided into [[town#New York|towns]] and [[city|cities]], incorporated under state law. Towns can contain incorporated [[village]]s or unincorporated [[hamlet (place)#New York|hamlets]]. New York City is divided into five [[borough (New York City)|boroughs]], each coterminous with a county. The major cities of the state developed along the key transportation and [[trade route]]s of the early 19th century, including the [[Erie Canal]] and railroads paralleling it. Today, the [[New York Thruway]] acts as a modern counterpart to commercial water routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thruway.ny.gov/about/factbook.html|title=New York State Thruway|work=thruway.ny.gov|publisher=New York State Thruway Authority|accessdate=September 15, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822025651/http://www.thruway.ny.gov/about/factbook.html |archivedate=August 22, 2014}}</ref> [[Downstate New York]] ([[Geography of New York City|New York City]], [[Long Island]], and the southern portion of the [[Hudson Valley]]) can be considered to form the central core of the [[Northeast megalopolis]], an urbanized region stretching from [[New Hampshire]] to [[Virginia]].

Non-Western Christian traditions and non-Christian religions did not grow for much of the state's history because immigration was predominantly from [[Western Europe]] (which at the time was dominated by [[Western Christianity]] and favored by the quotas in federal immigration law). The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] removed the quotas, allowing for the growth of other religious groups.

The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] is the largest Christian denomination in New York (31%). The largest Roman Catholic diocese is the [[Latin Church]]'s [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archdiocese of New York]].

The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], and [[American Baptist Churches USA]] were the following largest Mainline denominations. Mainline Protestants together make up 11% of Christians in the state.<ref name=":1" />

In Evangelical Protestantism the [[Baptists]], [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational Protestants]], and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] were the largest groups.

New York exports a wide variety of goods such as prepared foods, [[computer]]s and [[consumer electronics|electronics]], cut [[diamond]]s, and other commodities. In 2007, the state exported a total of $71.1{{nbs}}billion worth of goods, with the five largest foreign export markets being Canada ($15{{nbs}}billion), the [[United Kingdom]] ($6{{nbs}}billion), [[Switzerland]] ($5.9{{nbs}}billion), [[Israel]] ($4.9{{nbs}}billion), and [[Hong Kong]] ($3.4{{nbs}}billion). New York's largest imports are oil, gold, aluminum, natural gas, electricity, rough diamonds, and lumber. The state also has a large [[manufacturing sector]] that includes printing and the production of [[garment]]s, mainly in New York City; and furs, railroad equipment, automobile parts, and bus line vehicles, concentrated in Upstate regions.

New York is the nation's third-largest [[grape]] producing state, and second-largest [[wine]] producer by volume, behind California. The southern [[Finger Lakes]] hillsides, the Hudson Valley, the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]] of Long Island, and the southern shore of Lake Erie are the primary grape- and wine-growing regions in New York, with many [[vineyard]]s. In 2012, New York had 320 [[wineries]] and 37,000 grape bearing acres, generating full-time employment for nearly 25,000 and annual wages over $1.1{{nbs}}billion, and yielding $4.8{{nbs}}billion in direct economic impact from New York grapes, grape juice, and wine and grape products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkwines.org/Pages/FactsAndFigures|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603133429/http://www.newyorkwines.org/Pages/FactsAndFigures|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 3, 2013|title=Welcome to New York Wine Country!|publisher=New York Wine & Grape Foundation|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
The [[Agriculture in New York|New York Agriculture]] industry is a major producer overall, ranking among the top five states for agricultural products including [[maple syrup]], apples, cherries, [[cabbage]], [[New York dairy industry|dairy products]], onions, and potatoes. The state is the largest producer of cabbage in the U.S. The state has about a quarter of its land in farms and produced $3.4{{nbs}}billion in agricultural products in 2001. The south shore of Lake Ontario provides the right mix of [[soil]]s and [[microclimate]] for many apple, cherry, [[plum]], pear and [[peach]] [[orchard]]s. Apples are also grown in the Hudson Valley and near Lake Champlain. A moderately sized saltwater [[commercial fishing|commercial fishery]] is located along the Atlantic side of Long Island. The principal catches by value are clams, lobsters, squid, and [[flounder]].

==Education==

{{Main|Education in New York (state)}}

At the level of [[higher education in the United States|post-secondary education]], the statewide public university system is the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY). The SUNY system consists of 64 community colleges, technical colleges, undergraduate colleges, and doctoral-granting institutions, including several universities. New York's flagship university is the [[University at Buffalo]], which was founded by U.S. President [[Millard Fillmore]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suny.edu/student/campuses_complete_list.cfm |title=SUNY Buffalo: Complete Campus List |publisher=Suny.edu |date= |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/archives/ubhistory/presidents.html|title=Chancellors and Presidents of the University|accessdate=June 20, 2016|publisher=University of Buffalo, The State University of New York|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610165345/http://library.buffalo.edu/archives/ubhistory/presidents.html|archivedate=June 10, 2016}}</ref> Along with the University at Buffalo, [[Binghamton University]] also ranks highly in the rankings of top public universities in the United States. New York City has its own [[City University of New York]] (CUNY) system, which is funded by the city.

[[Columbia University]], [[Cornell University]] and [[New York University]] are among the most prominent of the larger higher education institutions in New York, all of them leading, world-renowned private universities and members of the [[Association of American Universities]], the pre-eminent group of research universities in the United States. Other notable large private universities include [[Syracuse University]] and [[Fordham University]]. Smaller notable private institutions of higher education include [[Rockefeller University]], [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]], [[New York Institute of Technology]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[Yeshiva University]], and [[Hofstra University]]. There are also a multitude of [[postgraduate degree|postgraduate]]-level schools in New York State, including [[Medical School|medical]], [[Law School|law]], and [[engineering]] schools.

[[United States Military Academy|West Point]], the service academy of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], is located just south of [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], on the west bank of the [[Hudson River]]. The federal [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]] is at [[Kings Point, New York|Kings Point]] on [[Long Island]].

A number of selective private liberal arts institutions are located in New York. Among them are [[Bard College]], [[Barnard College]], [[Colgate University]], [[Hamilton College]], [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]], [[Marist College]], [[Sarah Lawrence College]], [[Skidmore College]], [[Union College]], and [[Vassar College]]. Two of these schools, Barnard and Vassar, are members of the elite [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]], originally all women's colleges with ties to the [[Ivy League]]. Barnard is affiliated with [[Columbia University]], its Manhattan neighbor, and Vassar became coeducational in 1969 after declining an offer to merge with [[Yale University]].

New York is also home to what are widely regarded as the best performing arts schools in the world. The [[Juilliard School]], located in the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]], is one of the world's leading music and dance schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jun/3/20050603-091115-3475r/?page=all |title=Still 'best reputation' for Juilliard at 100 |publisher=[[The Washington Times]] |accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Juilliard|last1=Frank Rich|publisher=Harry N.

The [[University of the State of New York]] accredits and sets standards for primary, middle-level, and secondary education in the state, while the [[New York State Education Department]] oversees public schools and controls their [[standardized test]]s. The [[New York City Department of Education]] manages the [[New York City Public Schools]] system. In 1894, reflecting general racial discrimination then, the state passed a law that allowed communities to set up separate schools for children of African-American descent. In 1900, the state passed another law requiring integrated schools.<ref>Martha A. Sandweiss, ''Passing Strange: A Gilded Age Tale of Love and Deception Across the Color Line'', New York: Penguin Press, 2009, p. 213</ref>

==Transportation==

{{Main|Transportation in New York}}
[[File:R188 Subway Car, 7898, 7, September 5th, 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[New York City Subway]] is [[List of metro systems|one of the world's busiest]], serving more than five million passengers per average weekday|alt=A subway train and many people are seen in New York City's subway system.]]
[[File:Grand Central Terminal ceiling view.jpg|thumb|[[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York City]]

New York has one of the most extensive and one of the oldest transportation infrastructures in the country. Engineering challenges posed by the complex terrain of the state and the unique infrastructural issues of New York City brought on by urban crowding have had to be overcome perennially. Population expansion of the state has followed the path of the early waterways, first the [[Hudson River]] and [[Mohawk River]], then the [[Erie Canal]]. In the 19th century, railroads were constructed along the river valleys, followed by the [[New York State Thruway]] in the 20th century.

The [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT) is the department of the [[government of New York (state)|government of New York]]<ref>[[Transportation Law]] § 11. "There shall be in the state government a department of transportation. The head of the department shall be the commissioner of transportation." Accessed July 19, 2015.</ref> responsible for the development and operation of [[highways]], [[Rail transport|railroads]], [[mass transit]] systems, [[port]]s, [[waterways]], and [[aviation]] facilities within New York State. The NYSDOT is headquartered at 50 Wolf Road in [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]], [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (PANYNJ) is a joint venture between the States of New York and New Jersey and authorized by the [[US Congress]], established in 1921 through an [[interstate compact]], that oversees much of the regional transportation infrastructure, including [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[seaport]]s, within the geographical jurisdiction of the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]]. This {{convert|1500|sqmi|abbr=on|adj=on}} port district is generally encompassed within a {{convert|25|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} radius of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]].<ref name="PANYNJ-annual-report-2002">{{cite web |url=http://www.panynj.gov/corporate-information/pdf/annual-report-2002.pdf|title=2002 Annual Report |publisher=PANY |year=2003 }}. Accessed July 19, 2015.</ref> The Port Authority is headquartered at [[4 World Trade Center]] in Lower Manhattan.

In addition to the well known [[New York City Subway]] system—which is confined within New York City—four suburban [[commuter railroad]] systems enter and leave the city: the [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad]], [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson]], and five of [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|New Jersey Transit's rail lines]]. The [[New York City Department of Transportation]] (NYCDOT) is the agency of the [[government of New York City]]<ref>[[New York City Charter]] § 2901; "There shall be a department of transportation, the head of which shall be the commissioner of transportation." Accessed July 19, 2015.</ref> responsible for the management of much of New York City's own transportation infrastructure. Other cities and towns in New York have urban and regional public transportation. In Buffalo, the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] runs the [[Buffalo Metro Rail]] light-rail system; in Rochester, the [[Rochester Subway]] operated from 1927 until 1956, but fell into disuse as state and federal investment went to highways.

The [[New York State Department of Motor Vehicles]] (NYSDMV or DMV) is the governmental agency responsible for registering and [[vehicle inspection|inspecting automobiles]] and other motor vehicles, as well as licensing drivers in the State of New York. {{As of|2008}}, the NYSDMV has 11,284,546 drivers licenses on file<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/Statistics/statli08.htm |title=NYS DMV—Statistics—NYS Driver Licenses on File—2008 |publisher=New York State Department of Motor Vehicles |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011011532/http://www.dmv.ny.gov/Statistics/statli08.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> and 10,697,644 vehicle registrations in force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/Statistics/regin08.htm |title=NYS DMV—Statistics—Vehicle Registrations in Force—2008 |publisher=New York State Department of Motor Vehicles |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011011840/http://www.dmv.ny.gov/Statistics/regin08.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> All gasoline-powered vehicles registered in New York State are required to have an [[emission standard|emissions inspection]] every 12 months, in order to ensure that [[environmental quality]] controls are working to prevent air pollution. Diesel-powered vehicles with a gross weight rating over 8,500 pounds that are registered in most Downstate New York counties must get an annual emissions inspection. All vehicles registered in New York State must get an annual safety inspection.

Portions of the transportation system are [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]], allowing travelers to switch easily from one mode of transportation to another. One of the most notable examples is [[AirTrain JFK]] which allows rail passengers to travel directly to [[airport terminal|terminals]] at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] as well as to the underground New York City Subway system.

==Government==

[[File:NYSCapitolPanorama.jpg|thumb|The [[New York State Capitol]] in Albany]]

The Government of New York embodies the governmental structure of the State of New York as established by the [[New York State Constitution]]. It is composed of three branches: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]].

The [[Governor of New York|governor]] is the state's chief executive and is assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|lieutenant governor]]. Both are elected on the same ticket. Additional elected officers include the [[New York Attorney General|attorney general]] and the [[New York State Comptroller|comptroller]]. The [[Secretary of State of New York|secretary of state]], formerly an elected officer, is currently appointed by the governor.

The [[New York State Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] and consists of the [[New York State Senate]] and the [[New York State Assembly]]. The Assembly consists of 150 members, while the Senate varies in its number of members, currently having 63. The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the governor's power to [[veto]] a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the legislature if there is a [[two-thirds majority]] in favor of overriding in each house. The permanent laws of a general nature are [[codification (law)|codified]] in the ''[[Consolidated Laws of New York]]''.
[[File:NYSCourtofAppeals1.JPG|thumb|New York State Court of Appeals, 2006]]

The highest court of appeal in the [[Judiciary of New York|Unified Court System]] is the [[New York State Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] whereas the primary [[felony]] [[trial court]] is the [[New York County Court|County Court]] (or the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters including [[small claims]], traffic ticket cases, and local [[zoning]] matters, and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The [[New York City courts]] make up the largest local court system.

The [[administrative divisions of New York|state is divided]] into counties, cities, towns, and villages, all of which are [[municipal corporation]]s with respect to their own governments, as well as various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school districts, fire districts, and [[New York state public-benefit corporations]], frequently known as ''authorities'' or ''development corporations''. Each municipal corporation is granted varying [[home rule]] powers as provided by the New York Constitution. The state also has 10 [[Indian reservation]]s. There have been several movements regarding [[Partition and secession in New York|secession from the state of New York]]. Proposals have included a state of [[Long Island]], consisting of everything on the island outside New York City; a state called Niagara, the [[Western New York|western counties]] of New York state; the northern counties of New York state called [[Upstate New York]]; making the city of New York a state; a proposal for a new [[Peconic County]] on eastern Long Island; and for the borough of [[Staten Island]] to secede from New York City.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Capital punishment===

{{Main|Capital punishment in New York}}

[[Capital punishment in the United States|Capital punishment]] was reintroduced in 1995 under the [[George Pataki#Death penalty|Pataki administration]], but the statute was declared unconstitutional in 2004, when the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''[[People v. LaValle]]'' that it violated the [[New York Constitution|state constitution]]. The remaining death sentence was commuted by the court to [[life imprisonment]] in 2007, in ''People v. John Taylor'', and the death row was disestablished in 2008, under executive order from Governor [[David Paterson]]. No execution has taken place in New York since 1963. Legislative efforts to amend the statute have failed, and death sentences are no longer sought at the state level, though certain crimes that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government are subject to the [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|federal death penalty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/NEW%20YORK.htm|title=New York Executions|date=October 25, 2005|accessdate=April 9, 2009|author=Rob Gallagher|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528081537/http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/NEW%2520YORK.htm|archivedate=May 28, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/07242008/news/regionalnews/gov_pulls_switch_on_death_cell_121295.htm|title=Gov Pulls Switch on Death Cell|date=July 24, 2008|work=New York Post|author=Scott, Brendan|accessdate=April 9, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Powell, Michael|title=In N.Y., Lawmakers Vote Not to Reinstate Capital Punishment|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47871-2005Apr12.html|work=The Washington Post|date=April 13, 2005|accessdate=April 11, 2008}}</ref>

New York City, as well as the state's other major urban locales, including Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers, and Syracuse, are significant Democratic strongholds, with [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal politics]]. Rural portions of upstate New York, however, are generally more conservative than the cities and tend to favor [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Heavily populated suburban areas downstate, such as Westchester County and Long Island, have swung between the major parties since the 1980s, but more often than not support Democrats.

New York City is the most important source of [[political fundraising]] in the United States for both major parties.
