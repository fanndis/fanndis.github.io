In May 1990, Nunn became full-time executive director, and by September 1990, Hands On Atlanta was coordinating 700 volunteers.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB7C4A204F4B7FD&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Volunteers handily turn good intentions into action | first=Maureen | last=Downey | newspaper=[[The Atlanta Constitution]] | date=September 18, 1990 | page=B1}}</ref>
Nunn later said, "I had a real passion for community service and volunteerism, so I had a real passion for the work."<ref name="divine"/>  She also credited her upbringing, saying in 1992, "My father has influenced me through example.

Similar organizations developed in other cities, and in 1992 they formed a national group under the name City Cares.<ref name="ellis-web"/>
By 1995, the concept of appealing to young working people had proven successful, and Hands On Atlanta had a budget of $1 million, a paid staff of 17, and over 11,000 volunteers on its mailing list, 7,500 of whom participated in a Hands On Atlanta Day.<ref name="nyt-hoa"/> At the end of 1998, City Cares of America relocated its headquarters from New York to Atlanta, and Nunn became interim executive director for it, while continuing on as executive director of Hands on Atlanta.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADA431EF5DBF39&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=City Cares group moves to Atlanta | newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | date=January 16, 1999 | page=B2}}</ref> (She was sometimes referred to in the press without the 'interim' designation.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/dec/31/news/mn-59326 | title= Angling to Reel in Volunteers | first=Mark | last=Fritz | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date= December 31, 1998}}</ref>) Subsequently, Nunn returned to focusing on Hands On Atlanta,<ref name="ac-not"/> and staged a successful, multimillion-dollar capital campaign for a new headquarters building in that city.<ref name="ajc-deep"/>

==HandsOn Network, Points of Light==
In late 2003, Nunn left Hands On Atlanta to become president of City Cares.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2003/09/08/daily27.html | title=Hands On Atlanta's Nunn leaving | newspaper=[[Atlanta Business Chronicle]] | date=September 12, 2003}}</ref>  In 2004, City Cares renamed itself to the [[HandsOn Network]].<ref name="ellis-web"/>  Under Nunn's leadership, the City Cares model changed somewhat, and a majority of new HandsOn Network affiliates were themselves volunteer centers.<ref name="ellis-web"/>

In 2006, Nunn was named to the [[President's Council on Service and Civic Participation]].<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/president-bush-welcomes-new-members-of-presidents-council-on-service-and-civic-participation-55327777.html | title=President Bush Welcomes New Members of President's Council on Service and Civic Participation | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] | date=February 14, 2006}}</ref> Later in 2006, she was the editor of ''Be The Change!

In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation began talks with the HandsOn Network to join forces through a merger to create one national organization with local affiliates focused on volunteering and service. They formally combined forces on August 11, 2007, to become the Points of Light and Hands On Network (later Points of Light Institute and later still just Points of Light).  Nunn presided over the merger, saying of its motivation, "We both could have continued along the route we were on, growing incrementally, but I believe neither of us would have achieved the kind of exponential change we wanted."<ref name="nyt-merge">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/us/11merge.html | title=Charities Trying Mergers to Improve Bottom Line | first=Stephanie | last=Strom | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 11, 2007}}</ref>  She also ensured that the combined operation had its main offices in Atlanta.<ref name="ajc-deep"/> During the three years following the merger, the staff dropped from 175 to 80 employees, due partly to eliminating duplicate positions and partly to the organization having lost its previous $10 million congressional earmark.<ref name="pol-unscathed">{{cite news | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/michelle-nunn-senate-campaign-106867.html | title=Michelle Nunn unscathed in Senate run ‚Äì for now | first=Manu | last=Raju | newspaper=[[Politico]] | date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>  During this time, Nunn's compensation grew from $120,000 to $250,000, which she later said was still less than that of her predecessor's $325,000.<ref name="pol-unscathed"/> The layoffs and her pay would become issues during her 2014 Senate campaign.<ref name="pol-unscathed"/>

As CEO of [[Points of Light]], Nunn formed good relations with the [[Bush family]], as the Points of Light Foundation had derived from President [[George H. W.

One of Points of Light's activities was to validate charities for [[MissionFish]], the charity arm of [[eBay]].
