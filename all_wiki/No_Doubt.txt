'''No Doubt''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Anaheim, California]], formed in 1986. The band consists of vocalist [[Gwen Stefani]], guitarist [[Tom Dumont]], bassist [[Tony Kanal]], and drummer [[Adrian Young]]. Since the mid-1990s, they have been supported by trombonist [[Gabrial McNair]] and trumpeter [[Stephen Bradley (musician)|Stephen Bradley]] in live performances.

Though their [[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|1992 eponymous debut album]] failed to make an impact, its [[ska punk]]-inspired follow-up ''[[The Beacon Street Collection]]'' sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, over triple that of its predecessor. The band's [[RIAA certification|diamond-certified]] album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'' (1995) benefited from the resurgence of [[third-wave ska]] in the 1990s, and "[[Don't Speak]]", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart. "[[Just a Girl]]", co-written by Stefani, was described as "the most popular cut on the CD".<ref name="orangeCoast">{{Cite news|last=Christian Goulding|first=Susan|date=June 1996|title=An Uncommon Angst: In the shadow of the Matterhorn, No Doubt composed ''Tragic Kingdom''|page=24|work=[[Orange Coast (magazine)|Orange Coast Magazine]]|publisher=Emmis Communications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4v0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24|issn=0279-0483}}</ref>

The group's next album, ''[[Return of Saturn]]'' (2000), despite its Top 40 hit single "[[Simple Kind of Life]]", did not match the success of their previous album, but received critical praise and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] at the [[2001 Grammy Awards|43rd Grammy Awards]]. Fifteen months later, the band reappeared with the album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001), which incorporated [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] music into their work. The album was primarily recorded in [[Jamaica]] and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists [[Bounty Killer]], [[Sly and Robbie]], and [[Lady Saw]]. The album produced two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning singles, "[[Hey Baby (No Doubt song)|Hey Baby]]" and "[[Underneath It All]]". "[[Hella Good]]" was also nominated for a Grammy award. On November 22, 2002, No Doubt received the Key to the City of Anaheim, given by the Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Daly, in [[Disneyland]] during the band's appearance on 'Breakfast with Kevin and Bean' ([[KROQ-FM]]) where they performed five songs.<ref>{{cite web|date=November 21, 2002|title=News : No Doubt To Receive Key To The City Of Anaheim|url=http://www.nodoubt.com/blog/default.aspx?nid=3331&cmnt=1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926225928/http://www.nodoubt.com/blog/default.aspx?nid=3331&cmnt=1|archive-date=September 26, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-07|website=No Doubt official website}}</ref> After a 2004 tour the band embarked on solo projects, with Stefani releasing two successful solo albums ''[[Love. Angel. Music. Baby.]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Sweet Escape]]'' (2006), while Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, ''[[Invincible Overlord]]''. In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth effort, titled ''[[Push and Shove (album)|Push and Shove]]'' (2012), and released their single "[[Settle Down (No Doubt song)|Settle Down]]". They have sold over 33 million records worldwide.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1986–1989)===
[[Eric Stefani]] and John Spence met at a [[Dairy Queen]], and talked about getting a group together to play music. Stefani acquired a keyboard and gathered some players together to practice; these included himself (keyboards), his sister [[Gwen Stefani]] (backing vocals), John Spence (lead vocals), Jerry McMahon (guitar), Chris Leal (bass), Chris Webb (drums), Gabriel Gonzalez (trumpet), [[Starpool|Alan Meade]] (trumpet), and Tony Meade (saxophone). They practiced in Eric's parents' garage.<ref name="orangeCoast" />

[[Tony Kanal]] went to one of the band's early shows, and soon joined the band as its bassist. After initially rejecting her advances, he began dating Gwen, but they kept their relationship secret for a year, feeling that it was an unspoken rule that no one in the band date her.<ref name="btm">"No Doubt". ''[[Behind the Music]]''. [[VH1]]. April 9, 2000.</ref> Paul Caseley (trombone) also joined the band in 1987. Eric Carpenter (saxophone) joined the horn section soon after.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carpenter|first=Eric|date=2012-11-30|title=No Regrets, No Doubt|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2012/11/30/no-regrets-no-doubt/|access-date=2020-08-06|website=[[Orange County Register]]|language=en-US}}</ref> The group performed at an Orange High School backyard graduation party on June 6, 1987 with two other California ska bands. At the party, No Doubt's set included "Total Hate", "Too Much Pressure", "Danger", "Paulina","Gangsters", and the song "No Doubt". Video clips from the party have appeared on VH1's ''[[Behind the Music]]''.

In December 1987, Spence ended his life, several days before the band was to play a gig at [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|The Roxy Theatre]] for [[record industry]] employees.<ref name="btm"/> No Doubt disbanded but decided to regroup after several weeks<ref name="btm"/> with Alan Meade taking over vocals.<ref name="ocw">{{cite web |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/1998-03-05/music/tunes-and-toons/full/ |title=Tunes and 'Toons |work=[[OC Weekly]] |publisher=[[Village Voice Media]] |date=February 26, 1998 |accessdate=April 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217225009/http://www.ocweekly.com/1998-03-05/music/tunes-and-toons/full/ |archive-date=December 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> When Meade left the band, Gwen replaced him as lead singer,<ref name="ocw"/> and No Doubt continued to develop a live following in California.<ref name="btm"/> In early 1988, [[Tom Dumont]] left Rising, a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band of which he was a member with his sister,<ref name=":1" /> stating that local metal bands "were into [[alcoholic beverage|drinking]], wearing [[Spandex]]" but that he wanted to focus on music.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kam|first=Nadine|date=April 30, 1998|title='Tragic Kingdom' tour brings band to Hawaii|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/98/04/30/features/story3.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118105640/http://starbulletin.com/98/04/30/features/story3.html|archive-date=November 18, 2008|access-date=September 13, 2007|website=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]}}</ref> He joined No Doubt and replaced Jerry McMahon as the band's guitarist.

Caseley left No Doubt in July 1989 for the US Navy Band.{{citation needed|date= March 2018}}

===Debut album (1990–1992)===
Impressed by the presence of [[stage diving]] fans at No Doubt's concerts and Gwen's on-stage presence, Tony Ferguson signed the band to a multi-album deal with the newly created [[Interscope Records]] in 1990.<ref name="btm"/> No Doubt's [[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|self-titled debut album]] was finally released in 1992, but it featured no radio singles, although a video was made for "Trapped in a Box". The album's distinctly upbeat pop/cartoon sound sharply contrasted with the then-dominant [[grunge]] movement. Owing to the music world's direct focus on grunge, No Doubt's album was not supported by the record label, and was considered a commercial failure for selling only 30,000 copies.<ref name="ocw"/> The band embarked on a national tour in support of the album, though Interscope refused to support the tour.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bush|first=John|title=No Doubt {{!}} Biography & History|url={{AllMusic|id=mn0000341672|tab=biography|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=December 23, 2006|website=AllMusic}}</ref> The band failed to bring the audiences that it had attracted in southern California, and often found that ''No Doubt'' was not even available in the cities where it was playing.<ref name="btm"/> Eric Stefani began to withdraw from the group, vacillating between being in and out of the band.<ref>Heath, Chris.

===''The Beacon Street Collection'', ''Tragic Kingdom'', and Eric Stefani's departure (1993–1997)===
The band began work on its next album the next year, but Interscope rejected much of its material, and the band was paired with producer [[Matthew Wilder]]. Eric did not like to relinquish creative control to someone outside the band and eventually stopped recording and rehearsing. He left No Doubt in 1994 to resume an animation career with the [[cartoon]] [[TV series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref name="btm"/> Kanal then ended his seven-year relationship with Gwen, saying that he needed "space".<ref>''Born to Be''.

The release of 1995's ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'' and the single "[[Just a Girl]]" allowed the group to achieve mainstream commercial success. No Doubt began touring in support of the album late that year, and it grew into a 27-month international tour.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Willman|first=Chris|title=Future Tense?|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,276102_4%7C7534%7C%7C0_0_,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123082725/http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,276102_4%7C7534%7C%7C0_0_,00.html|archive-date=2008-11-23|access-date=2020-08-06|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> In 1996, the second single, "[[Spiderwebs (song)|Spiderwebs]]", was successful, and "[[Don't Speak]]", a [[ballad]] written by Gwen and Eric Stefani about Gwen and Kanal's break-up,<ref name=sullivan2011>{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Caroline |title='We'll make one more album, then I'll get pregnant' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/feb/15/shopping.artsfeatures |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 15, 2002 |location=London}}</ref> was released as the third single and broke the previous record when it topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Airplay for sixteen weeks.

The album's release fueled a dispute between Trauma and Interscope Records over No Doubt's recording contract. Trauma sued for [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million for [[breach of contract]], [[fraud]], and [[extortion]] and sought to have its [[joint venture]] agreement ended, claiming that Interscope had reneged on its contract after the band had become more successful than expected.<ref name=":2" /> No Doubt had previously stated that it had switched to Trauma Records and that the transition was "really great...because now we have the attention and the focus of a small indie label."<ref>{{cite web|date=1997-05-28|title=No Doubt In Middle Of Legal Battle|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432741/19970528/no_doubt.jhtml|accessdate=2017-07-27|website=MTV News}}</ref> The case was [[settlement (litigation)|settled]] out of court with a $3 million payment.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Thigpen|first=David E.|date=November 10, 1997|title=A Sound Rebound|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,987345-2,00.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023222704/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,987345-2,00.html|archive-date=October 23, 2012|access-date=December 30, 2006|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>

The band finished its tour in December 1997 and had several releases during the two-year writing process to make its follow-up to ''Tragic Kingdom''.<ref name="btm"/> ''[[Live in the Tragic Kingdom]]'', a live long-form video of the band's performance at the [[Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim]], was released and ''The Beacon Street Collection'' was re-released while the band was on tour that year. The band recorded "I Throw My Toys Around" with [[Elvis Costello]] for ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'', and it contributed to [[The Clash]]'s tribute album ''[[Burning London: The Clash Tribute]]''. Stefani began to make recordings without the band, contributing vocals to tracks for [[The Brian Setzer Orchestra]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Fishbone]] & Familyhood Nextperience, and her boyfriend [[Gavin Rossdale]]'s band [[Bush (band)|Bush]]. After some time in-between albums, No Doubt included its song "[[New (No Doubt song)|New]]" on the [[soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[Go (1999 film)|Go]]'' in 1999. "New", inspired by Gwen's budding relationship with Rossdale, was one of the first songs written after the release of ''Tragic Kingdom''.
In 2000, the band released ''[[Return of Saturn]]'', its follow-up to ''Tragic Kingdom''. The album featured a darker tone and was more lyrically advanced than No Doubt's previous work.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|date=May 12, 2000|title=Return of Saturn - No Doubt|url={{AllMusic|id=mw0000057560|type=album|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=December 30, 2006|website=AllMusic}}</ref> The main lyrical focus of the new record had shifted from Gwen Stefani's relationship with bassist Tony Kanal to her new relationship with Gavin Rossdale.<ref name=":3" /> ''Return of Saturn'' was critically acclaimed, but was not as commercially successful as their previous album, and the lead single, "[[Ex-Girlfriend (song)|Ex-Girlfriend]]", failed to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States. Also released as singles from the album were the tracks "[[Simple Kind of Life]]" and "[[Bathwater (song)|Bathwater]]". Lukewarm sales drastically shortened the tour that followed, appearing only in festival settings in L.A., Cincinnati, Nashville, Jacksonville and Miami. On August 10, No Doubt went on [[VH1 Storytellers]] and performed a few of their songs, and were joined by friend [[Alain Johannes]] (of [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]]) and former member Eric Stefani.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title=Timeline {{!}} Journal|url=http://www.nodoubt.com/band/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223124634/http://www.nodoubt.com/band/|archive-date=February 23, 2009|accessdate=2011-10-31|website=No Doubt official website}}</ref>

After ''Return of Saturn'', the band returned to recording in January 2001. During this time, it contributed a cover version of [[Donna Summer]]'s "[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]" for the ''[[Zoolander]]'' soundtrack and recorded a song with [[Kelis]] for her album ''[[Wanderland]]''. Stefani made high-profile appearances on [[Moby]]'s "[[South Side (song)|South Side]]" and [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve's]] "[[Let Me Blow Ya Mind]]".

Both singles managed to reach the top five on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also released "[[Hella Good]]" and "[[Running (No Doubt song)|Running]]" as singles. In addition, pop-star Prince co-wrote, produced, and performed on "Waiting Room" from ''Rock Steady''. Stefani had previously provided vocals for a song on Prince's ''[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]'' album, "So Far, So Pleased". In November 2002, No Doubt made an appearance in the ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' episode "Spiderwebs".<ref>{{cite web|title=Dawson's Creek - Spiderwebs|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/dawsons-creek/show/spiderwebs/episode/10146|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306012807/http://tv.yahoo.com/dawsons-creek/show/spiderwebs/episode/10146|archive-date=2012-03-06|accessdate=2017-01-18|website=[[Yahoo!

It included a [[cover version|cover]] of the song "[[It's My Life (No Doubt song)|It's My Life]]", which had originally been a hit for [[synthpop]] group [[Talk Talk]] in 1984, and earned No Doubt a Grammy nomination for Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4262875.stm |title=Grammy Awards 2005: Key winners |date=14 February 2005 |website=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Additionally, a special 2-CD 2-[[DVD]] [[box set]] titled ''[[Boom Box (No Doubt album)|Boom Box]]'' was made available, which included the CDs ''The Singles 1992–2003'' and ''[[Everything in Time (B-sides, Rarities, Remixes)|Everything in Time]]'' and the DVDs ''[[The Videos 1992–2003]]'' and ''[[Live in the Tragic Kingdom]]''.

I was really drained and burned out when we recorded that album [2012's ''Push and Shove'']. And I had a lot of guilt: 'I have to do it.' That's not the right setting to make music. There's some really great writing on that record. But the production felt really conflicted.

The case was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and cited [[Activision]], the game's distributor, as having exceeded contractual likenesses of the members of No Doubt.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/11/no-doubt-sues-activision-over-band-hero.html |title=No Doubt sues Activision over Band Hero |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>

App. 4th|vol=192|opinion=1018|date=February 15, 2011|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319222440/http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/192CA4t1018.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319222440/http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/192CA4t1018.htm|archive-date=March 19, 2017}}</ref> The [[appellate court]] explained that the dispute arose from No Doubt's discovery, two weeks before ''Band Hero'' went on sale, that its band members could be manipulated in the game to perform songs they would never perform in real life. The court then explained: "The band also learned that female lead singer Gwen Stefani's avatar could be made to sing in a male voice, and the male band members' avatars could be manipulated to sing songs in female voices. The individual band member avatars could be made to perform solo, without their band members, as well as with members of other groups." The court then ruled that Activision's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] defense was meritless, No Doubt had a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits, and that No Doubt was entitled to recover costs and attorney's fees incurred in opposing Activision's appeal.
