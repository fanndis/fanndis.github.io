'''Alan Bennett Krueger''' (September 17, 1960 – March 16, 2019) was an American [[economist]] who was the [[James Madison]] Professor of Political Economy at [[Princeton University]] and Research Associate at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]. He served as [[Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy]], nominated by President [[Barack Obama]], from May 2009 to October 2010, when he returned to Princeton. He was nominated in 2011 by Obama as chair of the White House [[Council of Economic Advisers]], and served in that office from November 2011 to August 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/author/alan-krueger|title=Alan Krueger|publisher=The White House President Barack Obama|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref> He was among the 50 highest ranked economists in the world according to [[Research Papers in Economics]].

== Early life and education ==
Krueger grew up in a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref>[http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/172080/meet-the-four-jews-shaping-the-us-economy/ The Jewish Daily Forward: "Meet the Four Jews Shaping the U.S. Economy" By Nathan Guttman] February 28, 2013</ref> in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], and graduated from [[Livingston High School (New Jersey)|Livingston High School]] in 1979.<ref>Kwoh, Leslie.

Accessed August 29, 2011. "Krueger, 50, a Livingston native, returned to academia a year ago after serving for two years as assistant treasury secretary for economic policy to the Obama administration."</ref>

Krueger received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] from the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] (with honors), and he received his [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Economics]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1985 and 1987, respectively.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://krueger.princeton.edu/home|title=Alan B.

Krueger compared restaurant jobs in New Jersey, which raised its minimum wage, to restaurant jobs in Pennsylvania, which did not, and found that restaurant employment in New Jersey increased, while it decreased in Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/weekinreview/conversations-david-card-alan-krueger-two-economists-catch-clinton-s-eye-bucking.html|title=Conversations/David Card and Alan Krueger; Two Economists Catch Clinton's Eye By Bucking the Common Wisdom|first=Sylvia|last=Nasar|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 22, 1993|access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> The results reinvigorated the academic debate on the employment effects of minimum wages and spawned a large literature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schmitt|first1=John|title=Why Does the Minimum Wage Have No Discernible Effect on Employment?|url=https://cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf|website=cepr.net/|publisher=Centre for Economic and Policy Research|access-date=February 5, 2016}}</ref>

His books, ''Education Matters: Selected Essays by Alan B. Krueger'' and (with [[James Heckman]]) ''Inequality in America: What Role for Human Capital Policies?'' reviewed the available research relating to positive [[externality|externalities]] accruing to society from increased government investment in educating the children of the poor. In ''Inequality in America'', he writes:<ref>{{Harvnb|Heckman|Krueger|2003|p=62}}</ref>

{{Quote|text=I would emphasize that I do not envision investment in human capital development as the sole component of a program to address the adverse consequences of income inequality. It is part of the solution, but not the whole solution. In principle, the optimal governmental policy regarding income inequality would employ multiple instruments, up to the point at which the social benefit per additional dollar of cost of each instrument is equal across all instruments.}}

In his book, ''What Makes a Terrorist: Economics and the Roots of Terrorism'' (2007), he wrote that in contrast to the assumption that terrorists come from impoverished, uneducated environments, terrorists often come from middle-class, college-educated backgrounds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Krueger|2007|p=77}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62904/lawrence-d-freedman/the-history-of-terrorism-from-antiquity-to-al-qaeda-denial-of-sa|title=Review: What Makes a Terrorist|first=Lawrence D.|last=Freedman|date=November–December 2007|access-date=August 29, 2011|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]}}</ref>
