{{about|the business process involving a single company|offshore outsourcing|Outsourcing|other uses|Offshore (disambiguation)}}

'''Offshoring''' is the relocation of a [[business process]] from one country to another—typically an operational process, such as manufacturing, or supporting processes, such as accounting. Typically this refers to a [[company]] business, although state governments may also employ offshoring.<ref>{{cite document|title=The Offshoring of American Government |publisher=Cornell Law Review|date=November 2008|ssrn=1143044}}</ref> More recently, technical and administrative services have been offshored.

Offshoring and [[outsourcing]] are not mutually inclusive: there can be one without the other. They can be intertwined ([[offshore outsourcing]]), and can be individually or jointly, partially or completely reversed, involving terms such as [[#Re-shoring|reshoring]], [[#Reshoring terminology|inshoring]], and [[insourcing]].

Offshoring is when the offshored work is done by means of an internal (captive) delivery model.,<ref name="Papers.ssrn.com">{{cite journal |ssrn=1287369 |title=SSRN-A Dynamic Perspective on Next-Generation Offshoring: The Global Sourcing of Science and Engineering Talent |author1=Stephan Manning  |author2=Silvia Massini  |author3=Arie Lewin |journal=[[Academy of Management Perspectives]] |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=35–54 |date=October 20, 2008  |doi=10.5465/amp.2008.34587994|s2cid=8998524 }}</ref> sometimes referred to as ''in-house offshore.''<ref name=InH.off_CIO>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[CIO magazine]] |url=https://www.cio.com/article/2437922/captive-audience--how-to-partner-with-service-providers-to-improve-in-house-offshore-ope.html |title=Captive Audience: How to Partner with Service Providers to Improve In-House Offshore Operations |quote=a.k.a. internal shared-services centers in low-cost locations |author1=Cliff Justice |author2=Stan Lepeak}}</ref>

Imported services from subsidiaries or other closely related suppliers are included, whereas intermediate goods, such as partially completed

Imported intermediate goods are included in offshoring in "Swenson, D: "International Outsourcing", in ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2008.</ref>

==Motivation==
Lower cost and increased corporate profitability are often the motivation, economists call this [[labor arbitrage]]. More recently, offshoring drivers also include access to qualified personnel abroad, in particular in technical professions, and increasing speed to market.<ref name="Papers.ssrn.com"/>

Jobs are added in the destination country providing the goods or services and are subtracted from the higher-cost labor country.<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of Organizational Ethnography  |author=Milosz Miszczynski

==Destinations==
After its accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 2001, the [[People's Republic of China]] emerged as a prominent destination for production offshoring. Another focus area has been the [[software industry]] as part of global [[software development]] and developing [[global information system]]s. After technical progress in telecommunications improved the possibilities of [[trade in services]], [[India]] became one prominent destination for such offshoring, though many parts of the world are now emerging as offshore destinations.

==Frequently used terms==
Offshoring is defined as the movement of a business process done at a company in one country to the same company in another country.

It is not the same as [[outsourcing]], which is the movement of internal business processes to an external organizational unit. This is done under restrictions and strategies in order to establish consistency with the offshore outsourcing organizations. Many companies nowadays outsource various professional areas in the company such as e-mail services, payroll and [[call center]]. These jobs are being handled by other organizations that specialize in each sector allowing the offshoring company to focus more on other business concerns.

Subcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring or [[physical restructuring]], but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring: Offshore outsourcing.

Related terms include 
* [[nearshoring]], - relocation of business processes to (typically) lower cost foreign locations, but in close geographical proximity (e.g., shifting United States-based business processes to Canada, Mexico or [[Latin America]])
* inshoring, - picking services within a country
* [[bestshoring]] or rightshoring, picking the "best shore" based on various criteria 
* [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) refers to outsourcing arrangements when entire business functions (such as [[finance]], [[accounting]], and customer service) are outsourced. More specific terms can be found in the field of software development - for example [[Global Information System]] as a class of systems being developed for / by globally distributed teams.
* [[Bodyshopping]] is the practice of using offshored resources and personnel to do small disaggregated tasks within a business environment, without any broader intention to offshore an entire business function.

Offshoring can be seen in the context of either production offshoring or services offshoring, and refers to substitution of a service from any company-owned foreign source for one formerly produced in the company's home country, whether or not outsourcing is involved.

===Production offshoring===
Production offshoring, also known as [[physical restructuring]], of established products involves relocation of physical manufacturing processes overseas,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marketbusinessnews.com/financial-glossary/offshore-manufacturing/|title=Offshore manufacturing - definition and meaning}}</ref> usually to a lower-cost destination or one with fewer regulatory restrictions.

[[Physical restructuring]] arrived when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) made it easier for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to [[Mexico]].

This trend later shifted to China, which offered cheap prices through very low wage rates, few [[workers' rights]] laws, a [[fixed currency]] pegged to the US dollar, (currently fixed to a basket of economies) cheap loans, cheap land, and factories for new companies, few environmental regulations, and huge [[economies of scale]] based on cities with populations over a million workers dedicated to producing a single kind of product. However, many companies are reluctant to move high value-added production of leading-edge products to China because of lax enforcement of intellectual property laws.<ref>Fishman, T: "China, Inc." Scribner, 2006.</ref>

===IT-enabled services offshoring===
Growth of offshoring of IT-enabled services, both to subsidiaries and to outside companies (offshore outsourcing) is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s.<ref name=Telcom.out>{{cite book|title=Managing Projects in Telecommunication Service |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0470047674  |isbn=0470047674 |author=Mostafa Hashem Sherif |date=2006|quote=(chapter) COMMUNICATION AND OUTSOURCING  ... Roche, 1998}}</ref>

Much of the job movement, however, was to outside companies - [[offshore outsourcing]].

===Re-shoring===
"Re-shoring", also known as "backshoring"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.workforce.com/section/09/feature/25/27/70/ |title=Workforce Management Online, Dec 2007 |access-date=2010-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217231946/http://www.workforce.com/section/09/feature/25/27/70 |archive-date=2013-12-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> or "inshoring"<ref>{{cite web |title=Inshoring |publisher=Mike Karlesky |date=May 17, 2005 |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/inshoring.asp |access-date=31 July 2008}}</ref> is offshoring that has been brought back onshore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/91918/reshoring-bringing-back-jobs-to-usa|title=Reshoring Bringing Back Jobs to USA|author=Zacks Investment Research|date=April 29, 2015|work=Zacks Investment Research|access-date=29 April 2015}}</ref>

John Urry (distinguished professor of sociology at [[Lancaster University]]) argues that the concealment of income, the avoidance of taxation and eluding legislation relating to work, finance, pleasure, waste, energy and security may be becoming a serious concern for democratic governments and ordinary citizens who may be adversely affected by unregulated, offshore activities. Further, the rising costs of transportation could lead to production nearer the point of consumption becoming more economically viable, particularly as new technologies such as [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] mature.<ref>{{cite book |title=Offshoring |author=John Urry  |date=April 14, 2014  |isbn=978-0745664866 |publisher=polity UK}}</ref>

====Reshoring terminology====
'''Reshoring''' (also known as '''onshoring''', '''inshoring''' and '''backshoring''') is the act of reintroducing domestic manufacturing to a country. It is the reverse process of offshoring, where manufacturing is moved to another country where labor is cheaper.

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work<ref name="documents.worldbank.org">{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf|title=World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.}}</ref> considers the potential for automation to drive companies to reshore production, reducing the role of labor in the process, and offers suggestions as to how governments can respond. A similar movement can be seen related to [[Robotic Process Automation]], called RPA or RPAAI for self-guided RPA 2.0 based on [[artificial intelligence]], where the incentive to move repetitive shared services work to lower cost countries is partially taken away by the progression of technology.

==United States==
For the last twenty years,{{when|date=July 2020}} American companies have been "offshoring" and outsourcing manufacturing to low cost countries such as [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Vietnam]].

===Government response===
President Obama 2011 [[SelectUSA]] program was the first federal program to promote and facilitate U.S. investment in partnership with our states. This program and website helps companies connect with resources available on a Federal, State and local level. In January 2012, President Obama Issued a Call to Action to Invest in America at the White House "Insourcing American Jobs" Forum.<ref name="whitehouse1">{{Cite web|url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/11/president-obama-issues-call-action-invest-america-white-house-insourcing|title=President Obama Issues Call to Action to Invest in America at White House "Insourcing American Jobs" Forum|work=The White House|access-date=11 January 2012|author=Office of the Press Secretary}}</ref>

===Success stories===
Advances in [[3D printing]] technologies brought manufacturers closer to their customers.<ref>{{Cite journal

There have been several very successful stories of companies. In most cases hundreds if not thousands of jobs were created or reinstated. In the case of  [[Starbucks]], in 2012 it saved American Mug and Stein Company in East Liverpool, Ohio from bankruptcy.<ref name="strb1">{{Cite web |url= http://www.dailyfinance.com/2012/06/15/whats-so-special-about-this-starbucks-mug

===Avoiding failure===
Some cases of reshoring have not been successful. Otis Elevators' reshoring effort did not go well.<ref name="bsc2">{{Cite web|url= http://ww2.cfo.com/supply-chain/2014/06/avoid-failed-reshoring-project/view-all|title=How To Avoid a Failed Reshoring Project |work=CFO  |access-date=June 9, 2014 |author=Rosemary Coates}}</ref> Otis says it failed to consider the consequences of the new location and tried to do too much at once, including a supply-chain software implementation. This is not an uncommon reshoring scenario. Bringing manufacturing back to the United States isn't so simple, and there are a lot of considerations and analyses that companies must do to determine the costs and feasibility of reshoring. Some companies pursue reshoring with their own internal staff.  But reshoring projects are complicated and involve engineering, marketing, production, finance, and procurement.  In addition, there are real estate concerns, government incentives and training requirements that require outreach to the community.  To help with these projects, companies often turn to consultants that specialize in reshoring.<ref name="bsc3">{{Cite web|url=http://bluesilkconsulting.com/reshoring/|title=Are you ready to evaluate Reshoring?|work=Blue Silk Consulting Reshoring|author=Rosemary Coates}}</ref>

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], companies have used the reintroduction of domestic [[call centres]] as a [[unique selling point]].

==R&D offshoring==
Product design, research and the development (R&D) process is relatively difficult to offshore because R&D, to improve products and create new reference designs, requires a higher skill set not associated with cheap labor.

An abstract of a study published 2019, which did not include either India or China, and did not specify whether the offshoring was also outsourcing, said "that R&D offshoring contributes positively to productivity in the home country.".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=de Rassenfosse |first1=Gaétan  |last2=Thomson |first2=Russell|year=2019  |journal=Industrial and Corporate Change  |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|title=R&D offshoring and home industry productivity|volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1497–1513 |doi=10.1093/icc/dtz020|url=http://www.swinburne.edu.au/media/swinburneeduau/research/research-centres/cti/working-papers/CTI-Working-Paper-2-16-Thomson-and-de-Rassenfosse.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Innovation Offshoring, Institutional Context and Innovation Performance: A Meta-Analysis|first1=Nina|last1=Rosenbusch|first2=Michael|last2=Gusenbauer|first3=Isabella|last3=Hatak|first4=Matthias|last4=Fink|first5=Klaus E.|last5=Meyer|date=April 12, 2019|journal=Journal of Management Studies|volume=56|issue=1|pages=203–233|doi=10.1111/joms.12407|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Transfer of intellectual property===
There is a relationship between offshoring and patent-system strength. Companies under a strong patent system are not afraid to move work offshore because their work will remain their property. Conversely, companies in countries with weak patent systems have an increased fear of intellectual property theft from foreign vendors or workers, and, therefore, have less offshoring.

Offshoring is often enabled by the transfer of valuable information to the offshore site. Such information and training enables the remote workers to produce results of comparable value previously produced by internal employees. When such transfer includes protected materials, as confidential documents and trade secrets, protected by [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, then [[intellectual property]] has been transferred or exported. The documentation and valuation of such exports is quite difficult, but should be considered since it comprises items that may be regulated or taxable.

==Debate==
Offshoring to foreign subsidiaries has been a controversial issue spurring heated debates among economists. Jobs go to the destination country and lower cost of goods and services to the origin country.

On the other hand, job losses and wage erosion in developed countries have sparked opposition. Free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.<ref name="Paul Krugman">{{cite newspaper |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 12, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html|author=Paul Krugman|title=The Trouble with Trade}}</ref>

Currency manipulation by governments and their central banks cause differences in labor cost. On May 1, 2002, Economist and former Ambassador [[Ernest H. Preeg]] testified before the Senate committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs that China, for instance, pegs its currency to the dollar at a sub-par value in violation of Article IV of the [[International Monetary Fund]] Articles of Agreement which state that no nation shall manipulate its currency to gain a market advantage.<ref>Ernest H.

===Impact on jobs in western countries===
''The Economist'' reported in January 2013 that "High levels of unemployment in Western countries after the 2007-2008 financial crisis have made the public in many countries so hostile towards offshoring that many companies are now reluctant to engage in it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring|title=Here, there and everywhere|date=January 19, 2013|via=The Economist}}</ref> Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2007 that while free trade among high-wage countries is viewed as win-win, free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.<ref name="Paul Krugman"/>

Two estimates of the impact of offshoring on U.S. jobs were between 150,000 and 300,000 per year from 2004–2015. This represents 10-15% of U.S. job creation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2013/01/17/shape-up|title=Shape up|via=The Economist}}</ref>

The increased safety net costs of the unemployed may be absorbed by the government (taxpayers) in the high-cost country or by the company doing the offshoring. Europe experienced less offshoring than the U.S. due to policies that applied more costs to corporations and cultural barriers.<ref name="economist.com"/>

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work <ref name="documents.worldbank.org"/> highlights how offshoring can shape the demand for skills in receiving countries and explores how increasing automation can lead to [[reshoring]] of production in some cases.

===Public opinion===
U.S. opinion polls indicate that between 76-95% of Americans surveyed agreed that "outsourcing of production and manufacturing work to foreign countries is a reason the U.S. economy is struggling and more people aren't being hired."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703466104575529753735783116|title=Americans Sour on Trade|author=[[Sara Murray (journalist)|Sara Murray]] And Douglas Belkin|date=October 2, 2010|work=WSJ|access-date=29 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="gallup.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/146915/americans-top-job-creation-idea-stop-sending-work-overseas.aspx|title=Americans' Top Job–Creation Idea: Stop Sending Work Overseas|author=Gallup, Inc.|access-date=29 April 2015}}</ref>

==Effects of factor of production mobility==
According to [[classical economics]], the three [[factors of production]] are [[land (economics)|land]], [[labor (economics)|labor]], and [[capital (economics)|capital]].  Offshoring relies heavily on the mobility of labor and [[capital mobility|capital]]; land has little or no mobility potential.

In [[microeconomics]], [[working capital]] funds the initial costs of offshoring.  If the state heavily [[regulation|regulates]] how a corporation can spend its working capital, it will not be able to offshore its operations.  For the same reason the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomy]] must be free for offshoring to succeed.

Computers and the Internet made work in the services industry electronically portable. Most theories that argue offshoring eventually benefits domestic workers assume that those workers will be able to obtain new jobs, even if by accepting lower salaries or by retraining themselves in a new field. Foreign workers benefit from new jobs and higher wages when the work moves to them.

Labor scholars argue that [[global labor arbitrage]] leads to unethical practices, connected to exploitation of workers, eroding work conditions and decreasing job security.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=M.

==History==
In the developed world, moving manufacturing jobs out of the country dates to at least the 1960s<ref>General Accounting Office: [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06423.pdf "Offshoring:  U.S. Semiconductor and Software Industries Increasingly Produce in China and India"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202080257/http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06423.pdf |date=2010-12-02 }}, September 2006.</ref> while moving knowledge service jobs offshore dates to the 1970s<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jom.2007.02.012|title=History of offshoring knowledge services|journal=Journal of Operations Management|volume=26|issue=2|pages=141|year=2008|last1=Metters|first1=Richard|last2=Verma|first2=Rohit|url=https://works.bepress.com/rohit_verma/51/download/}}</ref> and has continued since then.  It was characterized primarily by the transferring of factories from the developed to the developing world. This offshoring and closing of factories has caused a structural change in the developed world from an industrial to a post-industrial service society.

During the 20th century, the decreasing costs of transportation and communication crossed with great disparities on pay rates made increased offshoring from wealthier countries to less wealthy countries financially feasible for many companies. Further, the growth of the [[Internet]], particularly fiber-optic intercontinental long haul capacity, and the [[World Wide Web]] reduced "transportation" costs for many kinds of information work to near zero.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |first=Sara |last=Baase |title=A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and The Internet |edition=Third |location=Harlow |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-13-600848-4 }}</ref>

===Impact of the Internet===
Regardless of size, companies benefit from accessibility to labor resources across the world.<ref>[http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1433214 Gartner Outlines the Top 10 Forces to Impact Outsourcing and IT Services Industry. Sep. 2010]</ref> This gave rise to business models such as [[Remote In-Sourcing]] that allow companies to tap into resources found abroad, without losing control over security of product quality.

New categories of work such as call centres, computer programming, reading medical data such as X-rays and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], medical transcription, income tax preparation, and title searching are being offshored.

===Ireland===
Before the 1990s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the EU. Because of Ireland's relatively low corporate tax rates, US companies began offshoring of software, electronic, and pharmaceutical intellectual property to Ireland for export. This helped create a high-tech "boom" and which led to Ireland becoming one of the richest EU countries.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

===NAFTA===
In 1994 the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) went into effect, and it increased the velocity of [[physical restructuring]].

The plan to create free trade areas (such as [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]]) has not yet been successful. In 2005, offshoring of skilled work, also referred to as knowledge work, dramatically increased from the US, which fed the growing worries about threats of job loss.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Offshore outsourcing==
There are four basic types of offshore outsourcing:
* [[Information technology outsourcing]] (ITO) is where outsourcing related to technology or internet such as computer programming.
* [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) involves contracting out of operational functions to a third party service provider.
* [[Offshore software R&D|Offshore software development]]
* [[Knowledge process outsourcing]] (KPO) is a type of outsourcing which involves or requires a more advanced technical skill and a higher level of expertise.

===Criteria===
The general criteria for a job to be offshore-able are:
* There is a significant wage difference between the original and offshore countries;
* The job can be [[telework]];
* The work can be transmitted over the [[Internet]];
* The work is repeatable.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Nonprofit Guide to Outsourcing|url=https://d2oc0ihd6a5bt.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/1482/2016/01/outsourcing.pdf|author1=Amy Karson  |author2=Marcia Brown|publisher=Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York|date=October 2012}}</ref>

===Source of conflict===
The opposing sides regarding offshoring, outsourcing, and offshore outsourcing are those seeking government intervention and [[Protectionism]] versus the side advocating [[Free Trade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-18/palen-outsourcing-and-protectionism/4762460|title=Protectionism leads to its own outsourcing problems|author=Marc-William Palen  |date=June 18, 2013}}</ref>

Jobs formerly held by U.S. workers have been lost, even as underdeveloped countries such as Brazil and Turkey flourish.<ref>Kupchan, C. (2012, January 1). The Democratic malaise: Globalization and the threat to the West, 62-67.</ref> Free-trade advocates suggest economies as a whole will obtain a net benefit from labor offshoring,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/free-trade-and-outsourcing-are-not-same|title=Free Trade and Outsourcing Are Not the Same &#124; YaleGlobal Online|website=yaleglobal.yale.edu}}</ref> but it is unclear if the displaced receive a net benefit.<ref>{{cite web   |website=Harvard.edu|title=The Politics and Economics of Offshore Outsourcing|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mankiw/files/outsourcing_-_march_7_2006.pdf|author=N. G. Mankiw  |date=2006}}</ref>

Some wages overseas are rising. A study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that Chinese wages were almost tripled in the seven years following 2002. Research suggests that these wage increases could redirect some offshoring elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web|website = Plunkett Research, Ltd.|url= https://www.plunkettresearch.com/industries/outsourcing-offshoring-bpo-market-research/|title=Outsourcing & Offshoring Industry Market Research}}</ref>

Increased training and education has been advocated to offset trade-related displacements, but it is no longer a [[comparative advantage]] of high-wage nations because education costs  are lower in low-wage countries.<ref>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/education/la-na-outsource6mar06,1,3461071.story?page=1&coll=la-news-learning&ctrack=1&cset=true|title=Education and learning}}</ref>
