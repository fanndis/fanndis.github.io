'''Joko Widodo''' ({{IPA-id|dʒɔkɔ widɔdɔ}}, born '''Mulyono''',<ref name="Name"/> 21 June 1961 in [[Surakarta]], [[Indonesia]]), also known as '''Jokowi''', is an Indonesian politician who is the [[List of presidents of Indonesia#Presidents|7th]] and current [[president of Indonesia]]. Elected in July 2014 as the first president not to come from an elite political or military background, he was previously the Mayor of [[Surakarta]] from 2005 to 2012, and the Governor of [[Jakarta]] from 2012 to 2014.

He achieved national prominence in 2009 for his work as the Mayor of Surakarta.

===Education and business career===
Jokowi's education began at State Elementary School 111 Tirtoyoso, known for being a school for less wealthy citizens.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Alim|first1=Abdul|title=Ratusan siswa SD Jokowi gelar aksi syukur|url=https://daerah.sindonews.com/read/674053/22/ratusan-siswa-sd-jokowi-gelar-aksi-syukur-1348242793|accessdate=21 July 2018|work=SINDOnews.com|date=22 September 2012|language=id-ID}}</ref> He continued his studies in State Junior High School 1 Surakarta,<ref>{{cite web|first=Arie|last=Sunaryo|title=Sejak SMP, Jokowi sudah dikenal pendiam tapi pintar|date=10 August 2013|url=http://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/sejak-smp-jokowi-sudah-dikenal-pendiam-tapi-pintar.html|work=Merdeka.com|accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref> and later wanted to attend State Senior High School 1 Surakarta, but failed the entrance exam and instead enrolled in State Senior High School 6 Surakarta.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gagal Masuk SMA Favorit, Jokowi Sakit Tipus dan Pendiam|date=23 September 2012|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/lifestyle/2012/09/23/gagal-masuk-sma-favorit-jokowi-sakit-tipus-dan-pendiam|work=Tribunnews|accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref> Jokowi graduated from the Forestry faculty at [[Gadjah Mada University]], [[Yogyakarta]], in 1985, where his work included studies and research on the use of plywood.

Jokowi, however, soon became uninterested in his activities in the firm and returned home. He then began working in his grandfather's furniture factory for a year before establishing his own company, Rakabu, whose namesake is his first child. The company, which mainly focused on [[teak]] furniture, nearly went bankrupt at one point but survived following a Rp 500 million loan from [[Perusahaan Gas Negara]]. By 1991, the company began exporting its products, and they were successful in international markets. The firm first established a presence in the European market in France, and it was a French customer named Bernard who gave Joko Widodo the nickname "Jokowi".<ref name="ibunda"/><ref>{{cite news|title=How a French connection gave Indonesia 'Jokowi'|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/10/20/how-a-french-connection-gave-indonesia-jokowi.html|work=The Jakarta Post|date=20 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="rakabu">{{cite news |title=Bagaimana Jokowi Bangun Pabrik Mebel Rakabu yang Terbakar? |url=https://indonesiana.tempo.co/read/71192/2016/04/20/iwank.1.2/bagaimana-jokowi-bangun-pabrik-mebel-rakabu-yang-terbakar |accessdate=13 October 2018 |work=Tempo |date=20 April 2016 |language=id}}</ref>

By 2002, Jokowi had become the chairman of Surakarta's furniture manufacturers association.<ref name="rakabu"/> Ultimately he decided to become a politician and promote reform in his home town, Surakarta, after seeing the neat layouts of some European cities while promoting his furniture there.<ref name="bantaran"/> After becoming mayor, he also made a joint venture with politician and former [[lieutenant general]] [[Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan]], when the two founded PT Rakabu Sejahtera (from Rakabu and Luhut's PT Toba Sejahtera).<ref>{{cite news|title=Jokowi Sudah Lama Bekerjasama dengan Luhut Panjaitan|url=https://www.rmol.co/read/2014/03/30/149243/Jokowi-Sudah-Lama-Bekerjasama-dengan-Luhut-Panjaitan-|accessdate=28 September 2018|work=rmol.co|date=30 March 2014|language=id}}{{Dead link|date=June 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Santoso|first1=Teguh Budi|title=Mengapa Publik (Terpaksa) Harus Menerima Paket Jokowi-Ma'ruf Amin?|url=https://tirto.id/mengapa-publik--terpaksa--harus-menerima-paket-jokowi-ma039ruf-amin-cZTW|accessdate=28 September 2018|work=tirto.id|date=20 September 2018|language=id-ID}}</ref>

After first joining PDI-P in 2004, Jokowi ran in the [[2005 Surakarta mayoral election|mayoral race in Surakarta in 2005]] with [[F. X. Hadi Rudyatmo]] as his running mate, with the support of PDI-P and the [[National Awakening Party]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.surakarta.go.id/konten/sejarah-pemerintahan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123174139/http://www.surakarta.go.id/konten/sejarah-pemerintahan |title=Sejarah Pemerintahan |archive-date=23 January 2017 |publisher=Pemerintah Kota Surakarta |access-date=4 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Begini Perjalanan Politik Jokowi, Si 'Capres Kerempeng' |url=https://news.detik.com/berita/2723501/begini-perjalanan-politik-jokowi-si-capres-kerempeng |accessdate=13 October 2018 |work=detikNews |date=20 October 2014 |language=id}}</ref> The pair won 36.62% of the vote against the incumbent [[Slamet Suryanto]] and two other candidates. During the campaign, many questioned his background as a property and furniture businessman. However, one academic paper claimed his leadership style was successful because it established an interactive relationship with the people, through which he was able to induce people's strong faith in him.<ref name="scribd.com">Cahyadi Indrananto (June 2012) [https://www.scribd.com/doc/95952212/Thesis-Local-Leaders-as-Agents-Dramaturgy-on-Political-Communication ''Pemimpin Daerah Sebagai Agen: Dramaturgi dalam Komunikasi Politik Walikota Solo Joko Widodo / Local Leaders as Agents: Dramaturgy on Political Communications of City Mayor Joko Widodo of Solo''], Postgraduate Thesis.</ref> He adopted the development framework of European cities (which he frequently travelled to as a businessman) as a guide for changes in Surakarta.<ref>Joko Wididi Raih Penghargaan Best City Award Asia Tenggara – Best City Award Delgosea Joko Widodo penataan PKL walikota solo</ref>

Jokowi's notable policies as mayor included:<ref>Sita W. Dewi and Kusumasari Ayuningtyas, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/11/18/poor-stagnate-while-city-thrives.html Poor stagnate while city thrives'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 18 November 2013.</ref> Building new traditional markets & renovating existing markets, constructing a 7-km city walk with a 3-meter wide pedestrian walkway along Surakarta's main street, revitalising the Balekambang and Sriwedari parks, employing stricter regulations on cutting down trees along the city's main streets, rebranding the city as a centre of Javanese culture and tourism under the tagline 'The Spirit of Java', promoting the city as a centre for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE), launching healthcare and education insurance program for all residents, a local [[bus rapid transit]] system named ''[[Batik Solo Trans]]'' and a Solo Techno Park, which helped support the [[Esemka]] Indonesian car project.<ref>Kusumasari Ayuningtyas, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/03/surakarta-mayor-uses-car-made-vocational-schools-students.html Surakarta mayor uses car made by vocational school students'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224154423/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/03/surakarta-mayor-uses-car-made-vocational-schools-students.html |date=24 December 2013 }}, ''The Jakarta Post'', 3 January 2012.</ref> It was during his tenure as mayor that he conducted the ''blusukan'', an impromptu visit to specific areas to listen to people's issues, which proved popular later in his political career. He also prohibited his family members from bidding for city projects, therefore suppressing the risk of corruption.

His supporters pointed to rapid positive changes in Surakarta under his leadership and the branding the city with the motto 'Solo: The Spirit of [[Java]]'. While in office he successfully relocated antique stalls in the Banjarsari Gardens without incident, a helpful move in revitalising the functions of the open green land; he emphasised the importance of business firms engaging in community activities; he improved communications with the local community by appearing regularly on local television. As a follow-up of the new branding of the city, he applied for Surakarta to become a member of the [[Organization of World Heritage Cities]], which was approved in 2006, and subsequently had the city chosen to host the organisation's conference in October 2008. In 2007, Surakarta had also hosted the [[World Music Festival|World Music Festival (Festival Musik Dunia/FMD)]] which was held at the complex of [[Fort Vastenburg]] near the centre of the city. The FMD in 2008 was held in the [[Mangkunegaran Palace|Mangkunegaran Palace Complex]].

Part of Jokowi's style was his populist 'can-do' (''punya gaye'') elements designed to build bonds with the broad electorate.<ref name="scribd.com"/> As mayor, he became personally involved in an incident just before Christmas 2011 when the Surakarta municipality had overdue bills of close to $1 million (Rp 8.9 billion) owed to the state-owned electricity company ''[[Perusahaan Listrik Negara]]'' (PLN). Following its policy of pursuing a more disciplined approach to collecting overdue bills, it imposed a blackout on street lights in the city just before Christmas. The city government quickly authorised payment but in settling the bill protested that the PLN should consider the public interest before taking such action. To reinforce the point, Jokowi made a highly publicised personal visit to the local PLN office to deliver the Rp 8.9 billion in cash in the form of hundreds of bundles of notes and even small coins.<ref>Kusumasari Ayuningtyas, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/04/residents-surakarta-accompany-mayor-pay-pln.html Residents of Surakarta accompany mayor to pay PLN'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 4 January 2012.</ref>

In 2010, he was [[2010 Surakarta mayoral election|re-elected for a second term]], again running with Hadi. They won 90.09% of the vote, losing in only a single polling station.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kemenangan Fenomenal Jokowi-Rudy |url=https://regional.kompas.com/read/2010/05/21/03402631/Kemenangan.Fenomenal.Jokowi-Rudy |accessdate=3 August 2018 |work=KOMPAS |date=21 May 2010 |language=id}}</ref> He was later chosen as the 'Tempo Leader of Choice' by [[Tempo (Indonesian magazine)|Tempo news magazine]] (2008) and received a 'Changemakers Award' from [[Republika (Indonesian newspaper)|Republika newspaper]] (2010); his name also started being considered in national polls for the governorship of Jakarta, long before PDI-P's nomination, including those by [[University of Indonesia]] and Cyrus Network (2011).<ref name="scribd.com"/>

In 2018, Jokowi announced that he would run for re-election [[2019 Indonesian general election|next year]]. His vice president [[Jusuf Kalla]] was not eligible for another term because of the term limits set for president and vice president. Kalla had already served a five-year term as vice president during [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]]'s first term (2004-2009). Speculation surrounding Jokowi's choice of running mate focused on several candidates including [[Mahfud MD]], a former defence minister and chief justice of the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Constitutional Court]]. In a surprise move, Jokowi announced that [[Ma'ruf Amin]] would be his running mate. Mahfud had reportedly been preparing for the vice-presidential candidacy. Ma'ruf was selected instead following a push by several constituent parties of Jokowi's governing coalition and influential Islamic figures.<ref>Marguerite Apra Sapiie, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/09/jokowi-may-pick-mahfud-md-as-running-mate.html Jokowi may pick Mahfud MD as running mate'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 9 August 2018.</ref> Explaining his decision, Jokowi referred to Ma'ruf's extensive experience in government and religious affairs.<ref>Sita W.

Before Jokowi's election, Indonesia's foreign policy under former President SBY was moulded by the mission statement, "A thousand friends and zero enemies".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idsa.in/issuebrief/IndonesiasNewForeignPolicy.html|title=Indonesia's New Foreign Policy - 'Thousand friends- zero enemy'|publisher=Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> Jokowi has mandated a three-pronged policy of maintaining Indonesia's sovereignty, enhancing the protection of Indonesian citizens, and intensifying economic diplomacy.<ref name="sovereignty">{{cite magazine|url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/01/the-trouble-with-indonesias-foreign-policy-priorities-under-jokowi/|title=The Trouble With Indonesia's Foreign Policy Priorities Under Jokowi|magazine=The Diplomat|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>

Jokowi aspires Indonesia to become a global maritime power ({{lang-id|poros maritim dunia}} or global maritime axis). He sees the sea would have an increasingly important role in Indonesia's future, and that as a maritime country, Indonesia must assert itself as a force between the two oceans: the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The five pillars of this maritime-axis doctrine are rebuilding Indonesia's maritime culture, maintaining and managing marine resources, developing maritime infrastructure and connectivity as well as developing the shipping industry and maritime tourism, inviting other nations to cooperate in the marine field and eliminate the source of conflicts at sea, and developing maritime defence forces.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jokowi launches maritime doctrine to the world|author=Rendi A.
