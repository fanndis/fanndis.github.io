The county was established in 1840 and is named in honor of [[William Barret Travis]], the commander of the [[Republic of Texas]] forces at the [[Battle of the Alamo]].

Travis County is part of the Austin–[[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]] [[Greater Austin|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. It is located along the [[Balcones Fault]], the boundary between the [[Edwards Plateau]] to the west and the [[Blackland Prairie]] to the east.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian and colonial periods===
{{Further|Spanish Texas}}
Evidence of habitation of the [[Balcones Escarpment]] region of Texas can be traced to at least 11,000 years ago. Two of the oldest [[Paleolithic]] archeological sites in Texas, the [[Levi Rock Shelter]] and [[Smith Rock Shelter]], are in southwest and southeast Travis County, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Hester |first1= Thomas |year= 1986 |title= The Balcones Escarpment: Early Human Populations |journal= Geological Society of America |volume= 6 |issue= 2 |pages= 55–62 |publisher= Abbott, Patrick L. and Woodruff, C.

The region (along with all of modern Texas) was claimed by the [[Spanish Empire]] in the 1600s, but at the time no attempt was made to settle the area (or even to fully explore it).<ref>{{citation|last=Chipman|first=Donald E.|title=Spanish Texas, 1519–1821|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas|year=1992|page=26|isbn=0-292-77659-4}}</ref> In 1691 [[Domingo Terán de los Ríos]] made an inspection tour through East Texas that likely took him through Travis Country. The first European settlers in the area were a group of Spanish [[friars]] who arrived from East Texas in July 1730. They established three temporary [[Mission (station)|missions]], La Purísima Concepción, San Francisco de los Neches and San José de los Nazonis, on a site by the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] near [[Barton Springs]]. The friars found conditions undesirable and relocated to the [[San Antonio River]] within a year of their arrival.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.texasalmanac.com/topics/history/spanish-missions-texas |title= The Spanish Missions in Texas |work= Texas Almanac |publisher= [[Texas State Historical Association]] |accessdate= September 10, 2011}}</ref>

===Mexican period===
{{Further|Mexican Texas}}
In 1821 [[Mexico]] won its independence from Spain, and the new government enacted [[General Colonization Law|laws encouraging colonists]] to settle the Texas frontier by granting them land and reduced taxation. Over the next decade, thousands of foreign immigrants (primarily from the United States) moved into Texas; in particular, American [[empresario]] [[Stephen F. Austin]] established one of his colonies near what is now [[Bastrop, Texas]] (in future Travis County) in 1827.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Myths, Misdeeds, and Misunderstandings: The Roots of Conflict in U.S.–Mexican Relations|editor-last=Rodriguez O.|editor-first=Jaime E.|editor2-last=Vincent|editor2-first=Kathryn|location=[[Wilmington, DE]]|year=1997|publisher=Scholarly Resources Inc.|isbn=0-8420-2662-2|contribution=The Colonization and Independence of Texas: A Tejano Perspective|last=de la Teja|first=Jesus F.|page=88}}</ref> Josiah and Mathias Wilbarger, Reuben Hornsby, Jacob M. Harrell, and John F. Webber were early settlers who moved into the area in the early 1830s.

===Republican period===
{{Further|Republic of Texas}}
In 1836 Texas [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared]] and [[Texas Revolution|won]] its independence from Mexico, forming a new Republic of Texas. After Texas Vice President [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] visited [[central Texas]] during a [[American bison|buffalo]]-hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838, he proposed that the republic's capital (then located in [[Houston]]) be relocated to a site on the north bank of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]. In 1839 the site was officially chosen as the republic's new capital and given the name [[Waterloo, Texas]]; shortly thereafter the city's name was changed to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in honor of [[Stephen F. Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/library/ahc/faq2.htm|title=Austin Public Library|website=Austin Public Library|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> A new county was also established the following year, of which Austin would be the seat; the county was named '''Travis County''', after [[William B. Travis]]. Though the Republic's capital moved briefly back to Houston during the events surrounding the [[Texas Archive War]], by 1845 Austin was again the capital, and it became the capital of the new State of Texas when Texas was [[Annexation of Texas|annexed]] by the United States later that year.

===Civil War and beyond===
{{Further|History of Austin, Texas}}
In 1861 Travis County was one of the few Texas counties to vote against [[Texas in the American Civil War|secession]] from the Union. Since the majority of the state did favor secession, Travis County then became a part of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] for the duration of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the Confederacy's defeat, Texas was fully readmitted to the Union in 1870.

From the end of the Civil War to the early twenty-first century, Travis County has experienced steady, rapid population growth (averaging more than a 36% increase every decade from 1870 to 2010), driven largely by the growth of Austin and its suburbs; it is now the fifth most populous county in Texas, after [[Harris County, Texas|Harris]] (Houston), [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas]], [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] ([[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]) and [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar]] ([[San Antonio]]) counties.

==Geography==
[[File:TravisCountyJusticeCenterTX.JPG|thumb|right|Travis County Justice Complex]]

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|1023|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|990|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|33|sqmi}} (3.2%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_48.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=May 11, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> Travis County is located in the southern part of [[central Texas]], between [[San Antonio]] and [[Dallas–Fort Worth]]. The county's [[geographical center]] lies two miles northwest of downtown Austin at 30°18' north latitude and 97°45' west longitude.<ref name="handbook">{{Cite web|first=Vivian Elizabeth|last=Smyrl|title=TRAVIS COUNTY|website=[[Handbook of Texas Online]]|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hct08|accessdate=18 April 2015|date=15 June 2010|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]}}</ref>

Travis County straddles the [[Balcones Fault]], the boundary between the [[Edwards Plateau]] to the west and the Texas Coastal Plain to the east. The western part of the county is characterized by the [[Karst|karst topography]] of the [[Texas Hill Country]], while the eastern part exhibits the fertile plains and farmlands of the [[Blackland Prairie]]. The [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] meanders through the county from west to east, forming a series of man-made lakes ([[Lake Travis]], [[Lake Austin]], and [[Lady Bird Lake]]). Lake Travis garnered national attention in September 2020 as the site of a major boating accident during a Trump Boat Parade in which five boats sank.<ref>https://www.npr.org/2020/09/06/910322916/5-boats-sink-at-trump-boat-parade-in-texas</ref>

===Springs===

{{Main|Springs of Travis County, Texas}}
The [[limestone]] karst geology of the western and southwestern parts of Travis County gives rise to numerous [[cavern]]s and [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], some of which have provided shelter and water for humans in the region for thousands of years. Notable springs in the county include [[Barton Springs]], [[Deep Eddy]] and [[Hamilton Pool]].

===Major highways===
{{See also|List of highways in Travis County, Texas}}
Travis County is crossed by [[Interstate 35 (Texas)|Interstate Highway 35]], US Highways [[U.S. Route 183 in Texas|183]] and [[U.S. Highway 290 (Texas)|290]], and [[Texas State Highway 71|Texas Highway 71]]. IH-35 leads northward to [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] and [[Dallas–Fort Worth]] and southward to [[San Antonio]]. US-183 leads northward through [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to [[Lampasas, Texas|Lampasas]] and southward to [[Lockhart, Texas|Lockhart]]. US-290 leads westward to [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]] and eastward to [[Houston]]. TX-71 leads westward to [[Marble Falls, Texas|Marble Falls]] and eastward to [[Bastrop, Texas|Bastrop]].

Other major highways within the county include [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Texas Highway Loop 1]] (the "Mopac Expressway"), which runs from north to south through the center of the county, and [[Texas State Highway 45|Texas Highway 45]], which forms parts of an incomplete [[Ring road|highway loop]] around Austin. [[Texas State Highway 130|Texas Highway 130]] (constructed as an alternative to IH-35 for long-distance traffic wishing to avoid Austin and San Antonio) also runs from north to south through the sparsely populated eastern part of the county.

==Government and infrastructure==
[[File:TravisCounty.JPG|thumb|left|Ned Granger Administration Building in Austin]]
Like other Texas counties, Travis County is governed by a [[Commissioners' Court]] composed of the [[county judge]] and four county commissioners. The court levies county taxes and sets the budgets for county officials and agencies. The judge and commissioners are elected for four-year terms (the judge at-large, and the commissioners from geographic precincts). The other major county-wide official is the [[county clerk]], who maintains the county's records, administers [[election]]s, and oversees legal documentation (such as property [[deed]]s, [[marriage license]]s and [[Doing business as|assumed name certificates]]). The clerk is also elected at-large for a four-year term.

The [[Heman Marion Sweatt Travis County Courthouse]] is located in [[downtown Austin]]. The county courthouse holds civil and criminal [[trial court]]s and other functions of county government. {{As of|2017}}, the county's [[probate court]]s are in the process of being moved from the county courthouse into Austin's [[United States Courthouse (Austin, Texas, 1936)|1936 United States Courthouse]], which was acquired by the county in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Travis County gets old federal courthouse for probate court expansion|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=December 29, 2016|first=Taylor|last=Goldenstein|url=http://www.mystatesman.com/news/travis-county-gets-old-federal-courthouse-for-probate-court-expansion/ahrQn7uVi38GIZN9zRStYN/|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref>
