'''Wheatley''' is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in [[Oxfordshire]], about {{convert|5|mi|0}} east of [[Oxford]].

==Archaeology==
There was a [[Roman villa]] on Castle Hill, about {{convert|1|mi|km}} southeast of the [[parish church]]. It was excavated in 1845, when [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] dating from AD 260 to 378 and fragments of [[Ancient Roman pottery|Roman pottery]] and [[Imbrex and tegula|Roman tiles]] were found.

==Manor==
The village had its beginnings in the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon era]]. It is in a valley running eastwards, the stream of which flows through the centre of the village to join the [[River Thame]], a tributary of the [[River Thames]]. The stream used to be in the open, with stepping stones for people to cross it. However, it is now in a [[culvert]] that runs along under the High Street.

In 1883 a Saxon cemetery was excavated, and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] removed from it are housed in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]]. In the 13th century Wheatley was part of the property of [[Abingdon Abbey]], and in 1279 was described as a hamlet of [[Cuddesdon]].

Wheatley [[manor house]] was enlarged and improved in 1601, and bears an [[inscription]] on the front stating ''T.A. 1601'', which stands for Thomas Archdale, the then owner. It still retains its original appearance whereas most of the other old cottages and buildings have been restored.

==Churches==

The [[Church of England]] [[St Mary the Virgin, Wheatley|parish church of St. Mary the Virgin]] was built in the 18th century. [[Samuel Wilberforce]], [[Bishop of Oxford]], disliked the building and had it rebuilt in 1855-1857 by the [[Diocese of Oxford|Oxford Diocesan]] architect, [[George Edmund Street|G. E. Street]].<ref>Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 837</ref> Its tower has a [[Change ringing|peal]] of six bells,<ref>[http://www.oxfordcitybranch.org.uk/towers.htm Oxford Diocesan Guild of Church Bellringers, Oxford City Branch]</ref> four of which came from the former 18th century church. There is also a [[Russia]]n bell from Troitsa,{{clarify|date=August 2009}} thought to have been claimed as a spoil of war and given to the church early in the 20th century.

The [[Congregational church#United Kingdom|Congregational church]] was built in 1842â€“1843 on the site of the old [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]]. It is now a [[United Reformed Church]]. Wheatley's [[Roman Catholic church]] is Our Lady of Lourdes in Crown Road. It is part of the parish of Corpus Christi, [[Headington]].

Wheatley Community Church is a new evangelical church which formed in 2015, and now meets weekly in the primary school.

There was once also an independent church in the old [[Granary]] building at 30 Church Road. Many Wheatley residents talk of having attended Sunday School at the 'mission', which is how a generation usually identify the church.

All the churches in Wheatley are now in a [[Local Ecumenical Partnership]] which also includes the parish church of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Saint Bartholomew]] in [[Holton, Oxfordshire|Holton]].<ref>[http://www.wheatleyareachurches.org/ Wheatley Area Churches]</ref>

==Economic and social history==
One of Wheatley's main industries was quarrying [[Cotswold stone|limestone]] which was used for building [[Windsor Castle]], [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], local cottages and ecclesiastical buildings, most of which were erected between the 13th and 18th centuries. Other occupations included [[Faggot (wood)|faggot]] cutting and [[ochre]] cutting, the ochre being crushed at the [[windmill]] which still stands today.

There were two windmills on the hill southwest of the village. One was a [[post mill]] which burnt down in 1875. The other, [[Littleworth Mill, Wheatley|Littleworth Mill]], is a [[tower mill]] that dates from before 1671. It has been rebuilt and re-equipped a number of times, including in 1784 when the [[Eagle Ironworks, Oxford]] supplied some of the machinery. The tower mill had fallen out of use by 1915, but since 1977 the Wheatley Mill Restoration Society has been restoring it.<ref>[http://www.wheatleymill.co.uk/ Wheatley Mill], United Kingdom.</ref>

Wheatley once had ten [[public house]]s. A plaque on a gable of the King's Arms in Church Street says that it was built in 1756.

In 1719 the Stokenchurch Turnpike Act turned the main road into a [[Toll road|turnpike]]. [[Stagecoach]]es between the [[Golden Cross, Oxford|Golden Cross in Oxford]] and London travelled ''via'' the Old Road over Shotover Plain to the west of the village. Many of Wheatley's inns had an upper entrance in Church Road and another in the High Street to accommodate the change of horses. The George coaching inn opposite the manor house is now a house with courtyards.

The village lock-up, built in 1834, is a pyramid-shaped stone structure standing near the edge of the former quarry site. It has a heavy padlocked door and the floor space is about {{convert|6|ft}} square with a headroom of about {{convert|8|ft}}. In the 19th century it was used to lock up drunks overnight before sending them to the Oxford court. More recently it has been opened every [[May Day]]. For a small charge visitors can be locked up for five minutes or so, and given a certificate to prove it.

[[Wheatley railway station]] was opened in 1864 as part of an extension of the [[Wycombe Railway]] from {{rws|Thame}} to {{rws|Oxford}}. The railway linked the village to Oxford, {{rws|Princes Risborough}}, {{rws|High Wycombe}} and {{rws|Maidenhead}}. [[British Rail]]ways closed the line and Wheatley station in 1963. Kelham Hall Drive and Kimber Close have been built on the site of the station.

[[Shotover Park]] was the home of [[Lieutenant Colonel|Lt Col]] Sir [[John Miller (equerry)|John Miller]], who was [[Crown Equerry]] to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. In 1888, his grandmother gave the building known as the Merry Bells to the villagers for use as a [[temperance movement|temperance]] hotel as she was saddened to see so much hardship caused by drunkenness. Today the building houses a new public library and is a significant social centre of the village; ironically, it now has a licence to serve alcoholic beverages.

In the 20th century the [[Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill|Lady Spencer Churchill]] [[teacher training college]] was built on the north side of Wheatley. In 1976 the college merged with Oxford Polytechnic, which has since become [[Oxford Brookes University]]. This Wheatley campus is set to close in 2021, and to be replaced by housing.

In 1974 the [[M40 motorway]] was extended from [[High Wycombe]] to Junction 8 at Chilworth, about {{convert|2.5|mi|0}} east of Wheatley, giving the village a fast road link to London. In 1990 the M40 extension was completed, giving Wheatley a fast road link to [[Birmingham]]. The extension includes Junction 8A and [[Oxford Services]] about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} east of the village.
