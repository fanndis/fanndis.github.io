During his career as a film producer, [[Harvey Weinstein]], formerly of [[Miramax Films]] and [[The Weinstein Company]] (TWC), exploited his influential position to commit criminal sexual acts including [[rape]].

In October 2017, ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported that dozens of women had accused [[Harvey Weinstein]] of rape, [[sexual assault]] and [[sexual abuse]] over a period of at least thirty years. Over <!-- Do not insert higher numbers without citing a reliable source backing it up -->eighty women in the [[film industry]] had accused Weinstein of such acts. Weinstein denied "any non-consensual sex." Shortly after, he was dismissed from [[The Weinstein Company]] (TWC), was expelled from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] and other professional associations, and retired from public view.

Criminal investigations into complaints from at least six women are ongoing in Los Angeles, New York City, and London. In May 2018, Weinstein was arrested in New York and charged with rape and other offenses.<ref name="BBC News 25 May 2018">{{cite news|title=Harvey Weinstein charged with rape following New York arrest|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44257202|accessdate=May 25, 2018|work=BBC News|date=May 25, 2018}}</ref> In February 2020, he was found guilty of rape in the third degree and a criminal sexual act.<ref name=deadline/> In March 2020, he was sentenced to 23 years of imprisonment.<ref name=RansomSentenced/>

''The New York Times'' and ''The New Yorker'' were awarded the 2018 [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for their coverage of Weinstein. The scandal triggered many similar allegations against powerful men around the world, and led to the ousting of many of them from their positions. It also led a great number of women to share their own experiences of sexual assault, harassment, or rape on social media under the [[hashtag]] [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]]. The scandal's impact on powerful men in various industries came to be called the [[Weinstein effect]]. <!-- References for the assertions in the lead are found in the article body, below. -->

American musician and actress [[Madonna]], who has worked with Weinstein on her films, said in an interview with ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', "Harvey crossed lines and boundaries and was incredibly sexually flirtatious and forward with me when we were working together." She also said she was aware of his behavior like a lot of other women in the entertainment industry, but because he was powerful and successful, few spoke out against him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/magazine/madonna-madame-x.html?login=google|title=Madonna at Sixty|last=Grigoriadis|first=Vanessa|date=June 5, 2019|website=The New York Times Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630061311/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/magazine/madonna-madame-x.html?login=google|archive-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/music/madonna-says-harvey-weinstein-crossed-lines/|title=Madonna Alleges Harvey Weinstein Crossed 'Boundaries' with Her: He Was 'Sexually Flirtatious'|website=PEOPLE.com|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>

===In the United States===
The October 2017 allegations against Weinstein precipitated an immediate "national reckoning" against sexual harassment and assault in the United States,{{r|Rutenberg: Reckoning}} known as the "Weinstein effect." Compounded by other sexual harassment cases earlier in the year, the Weinstein reports and the subsequent "[[Me Too (hashtag)|#MeToo]]" hashtag campaign, which encouraged individuals to share their suppressed stories of sexual misconduct, created a cavalcade of allegations across multiple industries that brought about the swift ousting of many men in positions of power both in the United States and, as it spread, around the world.{{r|Cook/Simons|USA Today 2017-10-25}}

On October 15, 2017, deceased actress [[Misty Upham]]'s father, Charles Upham, went public with allegations that his daughter was raped by a member of Weinstein's production team at the same Golden Globes ceremony where she was honored for her work on one of Weinstein's films, and that other members of Weinstein's team had not only witnessed the rape but had cheered the rapist.<ref name=HollywoodLA2017>{{cite web|title=Misty Upham Raped at 2013 Golden Globes?|url=https://www.hollywoodlanews.com/misty-upham-raped-2013-golden-globes/|work=Hollywood LA News|date=November 10, 2017|accessdate=November 14, 2017|quote=My daughter, Misty Upham, was a victim of rape by a Weinstein Executive in 2013 at the Golden Globe Awards.}}</ref>

In the entertainment industry, allegations led to the ousting of actors and directors alike. Most prominently, actor [[Kevin Spacey]], comedian [[Louis C.K.]], and filmmaker [[Brett Ratner]] had projects canceled following at least six allegations apiece.{{r|AP: Impact Nov 10}} Over two hundred women accused filmmaker [[James Toback]] of sexual harassment.{{r|USA Today 2017-10-25}} In journalism, allegations led to the expelling of editors, publishers, executives, and hosts.

In April 2018, ''The New York Times'' and ''The New Yorker'' were awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] "for their coverage of the sexual abuse of women in Hollywood and other industries around the world."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Laforme|first1=Ren|title=Here are the winners of the 2018 Pulitzer Prizes|url=https://www.poynter.org/news/here-are-winners-2018-pulitzer-prizes|accessdate=April 16, 2018|work=Poynter|date=April 16, 2018|language=en}}</ref>
