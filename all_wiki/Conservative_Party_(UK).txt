The '''Conservative Party''', officially the '''Conservative and Unionist Party''', and also known colloquially as the '''Tories''' or simply the '''Conservatives''', is a [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Ideologically, the Conservatives sit on the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] of the British political spectrum. The Conservatives have been in government since 2010 and as of 2020, hold an [[Majority government|overall majority]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] with 364 [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Members of Parliament]]. The party also has 245 unelected members of the [[House of Lords]], 8 members of the [[London Assembly]], 31 members of the [[Scottish Parliament]], 11 members of the [[Welsh Parliament]] and [[Political make-up of local councils in the United Kingdom|7,430 local authority councillors]].<ref name="localcouncil"/>

The Conservative Party was founded in 1834 from the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory Party]] and was one of two dominant political parties in the 19th century, along with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Under [[Benjamin Disraeli]], it played a preeminent role in politics at the height of the [[British Empire]]. In 1912, the [[Liberal Unionist Party]] merged with the party to form the Conservative and Unionist Party. In the 1920s, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] surpassed the Liberals as the Conservatives' main rivals. Conservative Prime Ministers, most notably [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], led governments for 57 years of the 20th century.

Positioned on the centre-right of the political spectrum, the Conservative Party is ideologically [[Conservatism|conservative]]. Different factions have dominated the party at different times, including [[One-nation conservatism|one nation conservatives]], [[Thatcherism|Thatcherites]], [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] and [[Conservative Liberalism|conservative liberals]], while its views and policies have changed throughout its history. The party has generally adopted [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic policies]]—favouring [[free market]] economics, limiting state regulation, and since the latter 20th Century, pursuing privatisation of state-owned assets including rail, mail and energy. Although the party has also, in the past, advocated for [[protectionism]]. The party is [[British unionism|British unionist]], opposing [[United Ireland|Irish reunification]], [[Welsh independence|Welsh]] and [[Scottish independence]] and historically supported the continuance and maintenance of the [[British Empire]]. Party members have differing views on the [[European Union]], with [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] and [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] wings but recently the party has taken on a strongly eurosceptic position, embracing the slogan "Get Brexit Done" following the referendum on European Union membership held under Conservative government. On social policy, it has historically taken a more [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] approach such as advocating for [[blue law|Sunday blue laws]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Keep Sunday Special: Why Sunday trading regulations need to stay |url=https://www.conservativehome.com/sponsored/2020/06/keep-sunday-special-why-sunday-trading-regulations-need-to-stay.html |publisher=Conservative Home |accessdate=3 November 2020 |language=English |date=12 June 2020}}</ref> although this has receded over recent decades, perhaps evidenced best by the legalisation of gay-marriage by the Conservative-[[Liberal Democrat (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government|coalition government]] in 2011. In foreign policy, it favours a strong military capability and supports British participation in [[NATO]].

The Conservatives are a founding member party of both the [[International Democrat Union]] and the [[European Conservatives and Reformists Party]]. The [[Scottish Conservatives|Scottish]], [[Welsh Conservatives|Welsh]], [[Northern Ireland Conservatives|Northern Irish]] and [[Gibraltar Conservatives|Gibraltarian]] branches of the party are semi-autonomous.

The party's support base has consisted primarily of middle class voters, especially in rural and suburban areas of England. Its domination of British politics throughout the 20th century and its reemergence in the 2010s has led to it being referred to as one of the most successful political parties in the Western world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/book-review-the-conservative-party-from-thatcher-to-cameron/|title=Book Review: The Conservative Party from Thatcher to Cameron|date=10 April 2011|author=Steve Coulter|access-date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815212248/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/book-review-the-conservative-party-from-thatcher-to-cameron/|archive-date=15 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/19/the-conservative-party-may-be-destroyed-by-this-european-madness/|author=Philip Johnston|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=The Conservative Party may be destroyed by this European madness|date=19 April 2016|access-date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623063607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/19/the-conservative-party-may-be-destroyed-by-this-european-madness/|archive-date=23 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2017/05/why-tories-keep-winning|title=Why the Tories keep winning|author=Andrew Gimson|work=New Statesman|date=15 May 2017|access-date=18 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018071809/https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2017/05/why-tories-keep-winning|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Conservative Party (UK)}}
[[File:Robert Peel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Peel]], twice [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and founder of the Conservative Party]]

=== Origins ===
The Conservative Party was founded in the 1830s.  However, some writers trace its origins to the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 1670s [[Exclusion Crisis]]. Other historians point to a faction, rooted in the 18th century [[British Whig Party|Whig Party]], that coalesced around [[William Pitt the Younger]] in the 1780s. They were known as "Independent Whigs", "Friends of Mr Pitt", or "Pittites" and never used terms such as "Tory" or "Conservative". Pitt died in 1806. From about 1812 on the name "Tory" was commonly used for a new party that, according to historian Robert Blake, "are the ancestors of Conservatism".  Blake adds that Pitt's successors after 1812 "were not in any sense standard-bearers of 'true Toryism'".<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party from Peel to Major'' (1997) p. 4</ref>
[[File:1st Duke of Wellington 1831 cropped cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], served as the first Conservative Secretary of State]]
The term "Conservative" was suggested as a title for the party by a magazine article by [[John Wilson Croker|J. Wilson Croker]] in the ''Quarterly Review'' in 1830.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Safire|first1=William|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195343342|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&pg=PA144|accessdate=29 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330130525/https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&pg=PA144|archive-date=30 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The name immediately caught on and was officially adopted under the aegis of [[Robert Peel]] around 1834. Peel is acknowledged as the founder of the Conservative Party, which he created with the announcement of the [[Tamworth Manifesto]].  The term "Conservative Party" rather than Tory was the dominant usage by 1845.<ref>Ivor Bulmer-Thomas, ''The Growth of the British Party System Volume I: 1640–1923'' (1965) pp. 66–81</ref><ref>David Paterson, ''Liberalism and Conservatism, 1846–1905'' (2001) p. 5</ref>

=== Conservatives and Unionists (1867–1914) ===
[[File:Churchill V sign HU 55521.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Winston Churchill]], twice Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]
The widening of the electoral franchise in the 19th century forced the Conservative Party to popularise its approach under [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who carried through their own expansion of the franchise with the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]]. In 1886, the party formed an alliance with [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Spencer Compton Cavendish, Lord Hartington]] (later the 8th [[Dukes of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]]) and [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s new [[Liberal Unionist Party]] and, under the statesmen [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, Lord Salisbury]] and [[Arthur Balfour]], held power for all but three of the following twenty years before suffering a heavy defeat in [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]] when it split over the issue of [[tariff reform|free trade]].  Historian [[Richard Shannon (historian)|Richard Shannon]] argues that while Salisbury presided over one of the longest periods of Tory dominance, he misinterpreted and mishandled his election successes. Salisbury's blindness to the middle class and reliance on the aristocracy prevented the Conservatives from becoming a majority party.<ref>Richard Shannon, ''The Age of Salisbury, 1881-1902'' (1996)</ref>  Historian E. H. H. Green argues that after Salisbury's retirement the Party was ideologically driven and resembled a broader European conservatism. After its defeat in 1906, a radical conservatism emerged that sought to promote "tariff reform" (that is high new tariffs)  in order to unite the British Empire and protect British agriculture and industry from foreign competition and head off the threat of socialism.<ref>E. H. H. Green, ''The Crisis of Conservatism: The Politics, Economics and Ideology of the British Conservative Party, 1880-1914'' (1995).</ref>

Young [[Winston Churchill]] denounced Chamberlain's attack on free trade, and helped organize the opposition inside the Unionist/Conservative Party. Nevertheless, Balfour, as party leader, followed Chamberlain's policy introduced protectionist legislation.<ref>Peter Fraser, "Unionism and Tariff Reform: The Crisis of 1906." ''Historical Journal'' 5.2 (1962): 149–166.</ref> The high tariff element called itself "Tariff Reformers" and in a major speech in Manchester on 13 May 1904, Churchill warned their takeover of the Unionist/Conservative party would permanently brand it as follows:
:A party of great vested interests, banded together in a formidable confederation; corruption at home, aggression to cover it up abroad; the trickery of tariff juggles, the tyranny of a party machine; sentiment by the bucketful; patriotism by the imperial pint; the open hand at the public exchequer, the open door at the public-house; dear food for the million, cheap labour for the millionaire.<ref>Andrew Roberts,  ''Churchill: Walking with Destiny'' (2018) p 92.</ref>

Two weeks later, Churchill crossed the floor and formally joined the Liberal Party (he rejoined the Conservatives in 1925). In December, Balfour lost control of his party, as the defections multiplied. He was replaced by Liberal Prime Minister [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] who called [[1906 United Kingdom general election|an election in January 1906]], which produced a massive Liberal victory with a gain of 214 seats.  Liberal Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] enacted a great deal of reform legislation, but the Unionists worked hard at grassroots organizing. Two general elections were held in 1910, [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|one in January]] and [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|one in December]]. The two main parties were now almost dead equal in seats. The Unionists had more popular votes but the Liberals kept control with a coalition with the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]].<ref>R. C. K. Ensor, ''England, 1870–1914'' pp 373–428. [https://www.questia.com/library/1401979/england-1870-1914 online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408081229/https://www.questia.com/library/1401979/england-1870-1914 |date=8 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>Neal Blewett, ''Peers, the Parties and the People: General Election of 1910'' (1972).</ref>

In 1912, the Liberal Unionists merged with the Conservative Party. In Ireland, the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] had been formed in 1891 which merged Unionists who were opposed to Irish Home Rule into one political movement. Its MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster, and in essence, formed the Irish wing of the party until 1922. In Britain, the Conservative party was known as the Unionist Party because of its opposition to [[home rule]] in [[Irish Home Rule movement|Ireland]].<ref>Leala Padmanabhan, '[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30899534 'Conservative' or 'Tory': What's in a name?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220003436/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30899534 |date=20 February 2019 }}' (08/04/15) on BBC News</ref><ref>The [[Conservative Party Archive]] Trust, ''[https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/94891/CPA-guide-high-res-version.pdf Guide to the Conservative Party Archive] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009073843/http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/94891/CPA-guide-high-res-version.pdf |date=9 October 2016 }}'' (2009)</ref>

Under [[Bonar Law]]'s leadership in 1911–14, the Party morale improved, the "radical right" wing was contained, and the party machinery strengthened. It made some progress toward developing constructive social policies.<ref>Graham D. Goodlad, "The 'Crisis' of Edwardian Conservatism," ''Modern History Review'' (1998) 9#4 pp 10–13.</ref> Historian Jeremy Smith says Bonar Law was pushing hard—certainly blustering and threatening, and perhaps bluffing—but in the end his strategy proved both coherent and effective.<ref>Jeremy Smith, "Bluff, Bluster and Brinkmanship: Andrew Bonar Law and the Third Home Rule Bill." ''Historical Journal'' 36#1 (1993): 161–178.</ref>

=== First World War ===
{{Further|History of the United Kingdom during the First World War}}
While the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] were mostly against the war until the invasion of Belgium, Conservative leaders were strongly in favour of aiding France and stopping Germany. The Liberal party was in full control of the government until its mismanagement of the war effort under the [[Shell Crisis of 1915|Shell Crisis]] badly hurt its reputation. An all-party coalition government was formed in May 1915. In late 1916 Liberal [[David Lloyd George]] became prime minister but the Liberals soon split and the Conservatives dominated the government, especially after their [[1918 United Kingdom general election|landslide in the 1918 election]].  The Liberal party never recovered, but [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] gained strength after 1920.<ref>J. A. R. Marriott, ''Modern England, 1885–1945'' (4th ed. 1949) pp 375–432 [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.54679 online free]</ref>

Nigel Keohane finds that the Conservatives were bitterly divided before 1914, especially on the issue of Irish Unionism and the experience of three consecutive election losses. However the war pulled the party together, allowing it to emphasise patriotism as it found new leadership and worked out its positions on the Irish question, socialism, electoral reform, and the issue of intervention in the economy. The fresh emphasis on anti-Socialism was its response to the growing strength of the Labour Party. When electoral reform was an issue, it worked to protect their base in rural England.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nigel|last=Keohane|title=The Party of Patriotism: The Conservative Party and the First World War|publisher=Ashgate|year=2010}}</ref> It aggressively sought female voters in the 1920s, often relying on patriotic themes.<ref>{{cite journal |first=David|last=Jarvis |title=Mrs. Maggs and Betty: The Conservative Appeal to Women Voters in the 1920s|journal=Twentieth Century British History|year=1992|volume=5|issue=2|pages=129–52|doi=10.1093/tcbh/5.2.129 }}</ref>

=== 1920–1945 ===
{{Main|Interwar Britain}}
In 1922, [[Bonar Law]] and [[Stanley Baldwin]] led the breakup of the coalition, and the Conservatives governed until 1923, when a minority Labour government led by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] came to power. The Conservatives regained power in 1924 and remained in power for the full five-year term. They were defeated in 1929 as a minority Labour government, again led by MacDonald, took office. In 1931, following the collapse of the Labour minority government, it entered another coalition, which was dominated by the Conservatives with some support from factions of both the Liberal Party and the Labour Party ([[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] and [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]]).<ref name="Vernon Bogdanor, Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution">{{cite book|first=Vernon|last=Bogdanor|title=Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> In May 1940, a more balanced coalition was formed,<ref name="Vernon Bogdanor, Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution" /> the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], which, under the leadership of [[Winston Churchill]], saw the United Kingdom through World War II. However, the party lost the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] in a landslide to the resurgent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which won their first-ever majority government.<ref>Marriott, ''Modern England, 1885–1945'' (4th ed. 1949) pp 504–66.

The concept of the "property-owning democracy" was coined by Noel Skelton in 1923 and became a core principle of the party.<ref name="Matthew Francis 2011">Matthew Francis, "A Crusade to Enfranchise the Many': Thatcherism and the 'Property-Owning Democracy."

While serving in Opposition during the late 1940s, the Conservative Party exploited and incited growing public anger at [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], scarcity, controls, [[austerity]], and omnipresent government bureaucracy. It used the dissatisfaction with the [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] policies of the Labour Party to rally [[middle-class]] supporters and build a political comeback that won them the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]]. Their appeal was especially effective to housewives, who faced more difficult shopping conditions after the war than during the war.<ref>Zweiniger-Bargileowska, Ina. "Rationing, austerity and the Conservative party recovery after 1945." ''Historical Journal'' (1994) 37#1 pp. 173–97.</ref>

==== Modernising the party ====
[[File:Harold_Macmillan_in_1961.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harold Macmillan]] is closely associated with the post-war settlement]]
In 1947, the party published its [[Industrial Charter]] which marked its acceptance of the "[[post-war consensus]]" on the [[mixed economy]] and [[labour rights]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kynaston, David |author-link = David Kynaston|year=2007 |title=Austerity Britain: 1945–1951 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-7475-7985-4 |pages=238–41}}</ref> [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell Fyfe]] chaired a committee into Conservative Party organisation that resulted in the Maxwell Fyfe Report (1948–49). The report required the party to do more fundraising, by forbidding constituency associations from demanding large donations from candidates, with the intention of broadening the [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] of MPs. In practice, it may have had the effect of lending more power to [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] parties and making candidates more uniform.<ref>Dutton, D. J. (2004).

The success of the Conservative Party in reorganising itself was validated by its victory at the 1951 general election. [[Winston Churchill]], the party leader, brought in a [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|Party Chairman]] to modernise the creaking institution. [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton]], was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party Chairman 1946–55, he rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Woolton emphasised rhetoric that characterised the opponents as "Socialist" rather than "Labour". The [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] influence of Professor [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s 1944 best-seller ''Road to Serfdom'' was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter-century to have a policy impact. By 1951, Labour had worn out its welcome in the middle classes; its factions were bitterly embroiled. Conservatives were ready to govern again.<ref>Blake, Robert. ''The Conservative Party from Peel to Major'' (1997) pp. 260–64.</ref>

With a narrow victory at the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], despite losing the popular vote, Churchill was back in power. Although he was ageing rapidly, he had national and global prestige. Apart from rationing, which was ended in 1954, most of the [[welfare state]] enacted by Labour were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the "post-war consensus" that was satirised as [[Butskellism]] and that lasted until the 1970s.<ref>[[Toye, Richard]].

However, family allowances fell by 15% in real terms during that period.<ref>The Labour Party in Crisis by Paul Whiteley</ref>

"Thirteen Wasted Years" was a popular slogan attacking the Conservative record 1951–1964. Criticism came primarily from Labour. In addition, there were attacks by the right wing of the Conservative party itself for its tolerance of socialist policies and reluctance to curb the legal powers of labour unions, thus making them complicit in the [[Post-war consensus]]. The critics contend that Britain was overtaken by its economic competitors, and was unable to prevent a troublesome wage-price upward spiral. Historian Graham Goodlad calls for taking a longer perspective. He argues that there were significant advances in transport, healthcare, and higher education.  It would have been unrealistic to expect that Britain could continue as a world power after the huge expense of the Second World War, and the independence of India and other colonies. Goodlad says the Conservative foreign-policy leadership properly adjusted Britain's world role by building an independent nuclear capacity and maintaining a leading role in world affairs, and anyway successive governments seldom did a better job.<ref>Graham Goodlad,  "Thirteen Wasted Years: "Do the Conservative governments of 1951–64 deserve this label" ''Modern History Review''  (2001) 13#2 pp 2–5.</ref>

The Conservatives were re-elected in [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955]] and [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] with larger majorities. Conservative Prime Ministers [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], [[Anthony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Alec Douglas-Home]] promoted relatively liberal trade regulations and less state involvement throughout the 1950s and early-1960s. The [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 was a humiliating defeat for Prime Minister Eden, but his successor, Macmillan, minimised the damage and focused attention on domestic issues and prosperity. Macmillan boasted during the 1959 general election that Britain had "never had it so good".

In 1958, [[Geoffrey Howe]] co-authored the report ''A Giant's Strength'' published by the [[Inns of Court]] Conservative Association. The report argued that the unions had become too powerful and that their legal privileges ought to be curtailed. [[Iain Macleod]] discouraged the authors from publicising the report. Macmillan believed that trade union votes had contributed towards the 1951 and 1955 victories and thought that it "would be inexpedient to adopt any policy involving legislation which would alienate this support".<ref>{{cite book | author=Kynaston, David |year=2013 |title=Modernity Britain: Opening the Box 1957–1959 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-7475-8893-1 |page=158}}</ref>

Macmillan's bid to join the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC) in early 1963 was blocked by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]]. The period saw the decline of the United Kingdom as a prominent world leader, with the loss of practically the entire [[British Empire|Empire]] and a laggard economy.

=== Edward Heath (1965–1975) ===
[[File:Sir Edward Heath.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|[[Edward Heath]], Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1970–1974)]]
[[Edward Heath]]'s 1970–74 government was known for taking the UK into the EEC, although the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] of the party objected to his failure to control the trade unions at a time when a declining British industry saw many strikes, as well as a [[1973–75 recession|recession]] which started in 1973 and lasted for two years.

Since accession to the EEC, which developed into the EU, British membership has been a source of heated debate within the Conservative Party.

Heath had come to power in [[1970 United Kingdom general election|June 1970]] and the last possible date for the next general election was not until mid-1975.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393297.stm|work=BBC News|title=1970: Heath's surprise victory|date=5 April 2005|accessdate=1 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422054124/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393297.stm|archive-date=22 April 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> However a general election was held in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]] in a bid to win public support during a [[Three-day week|national emergency]] caused by the miners' strike. However, Heath's attempt to win a second term in power at this "snap" election failed, as a deadlock result [[hung parliament|left no party with an overall majority]]. The Conservatives had more votes than Labour, but Labour had four more seats. Heath resigned within days, after failing to gain [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] support in order to form a coalition government, paving the way for [[Harold Wilson]] and Labour to return to power as a minority government. Heath's hopes of returning to power later in the year were ended when Labour won the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]] with an overall majority of three seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393307.stm|work=BBC News|title=1974&nbsp;Oct&nbsp;: Wilson makes it four|date=5 April 2005|accessdate=1 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422042401/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393307.stm|archive-date=22 April 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Margaret Thatcher (1975–1990)===
{{Further|Premiership of Margaret Thatcher}}
{{Thatcherism|organisations}}
Loss of power weakened Heath's control over the party and [[Margaret Thatcher]] deposed him in the [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|1975 leadership election]]. The UK in the 1970s had seen sustained high [[inflation]] rates, which were above 20% at the time of the leadership election, subsequently falling to below 10%; unemployment had risen, and over the winter of 1978–79 there was a series of strikes known as the "[[Winter of Discontent]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393311.stm|work=BBC News|title=1979: Thatcher wins Tory landslide|date=5 April 2005|accessdate=1 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422045254/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393311.stm|archive-date=22 April 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Thatcher led her party to victory at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] with a manifesto which concentrated on the party's philosophy rather than presenting a "shopping list" of policies.<ref>[[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Dennis Kavanagh, "The British General Election of 1979", Macmillan, 1979, p. 154.</ref>

As Prime Minister, Thatcher focused on rejecting the mild liberalism of the [[post-war consensus]] that tolerated or encouraged nationalisation, strong labour unions, heavy regulation, high taxes, and a generous welfare state.<ref>David Dutton, ''British Politics Since 1945: The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of Consensus'' (2nd ed. Blackwell, 1997).</ref>  She did not challenge the [[National Health Service]], and supported the Cold War policies of the consensus, but otherwise tried to dismantle and delegitimise it. To replace the old post-war consensus, she built a right-wing political ideology that became known as [[Thatcherism]], based on social and economic ideas from British and American intellectuals such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. Thatcher believed that too much socially democratic-oriented government policy was leading to a long-term decline in the British economy. As a result, her government pursued a programme of [[economic liberalism]], adopting a free-market approach to public services based on the sale of publicly owned industries and utilities, as well as a reduction in trade union power. She held the belief that the existing trend of unions was bringing economic progress to a standstill by enforcing "wildcat" strikes, keeping wages artificially high and forcing unprofitable industries to stay open.

One of Thatcher's largest and most successful policies assisted council house tenants in public housing to purchase their homes at favourable rates. The "Right to Buy" had emerged in the late-1940s but was too great a challenge to the [[Post-War Consensus]] to win Conservative endorsement. Thatcher from her earliest days in politics favoured the idea because it would lead to a "property-owning democracy", an important idea that had emerged in the 1920s.<ref name="Matthew Francis 2011"/> Some local Conservative-run councils enacted profitable local sales schemes during the late-1960s. By the 1970s, many working-class people had ample incomes to afford to buy homes, and eagerly adopted Thatcher's invitation to purchase their homes at a sizable discount. The new owners were more likely to vote Conservative, as Thatcher had hoped.<ref>Aled Davies, "'Right to Buy': The Development of a Conservative Housing Policy, 1945–1980."

Thatcher led the Conservatives to two further electoral victories with landslide{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2017}} majorities in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]]. She was greatly admired by her supporters for her leadership in the [[Falklands War]] of 1982—which coincided with a dramatic boost in her popularity—and for policies such as giving the right to council house tenants to buy their council house at a discount on market value. She was also deeply unpopular in certain sections of society due to high unemployment, which reached its highest level since the 1930s, peaking at over 3,000,000 people following her economic reforms, and her response to the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike]]. Unemployment had doubled between 1979 and 1982, largely due to Thatcher's [[monetarism|monetarist]] battle against inflation.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm|work=BBC News|title=1983: Thatcher triumphs again|date=5 April 2005|access-date=1 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422033837/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm|archive-date=22 April 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Stephanie Flanders|title=Were 364 economists all wrong?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4803858.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 January 2015|author-link=Stephanie Flanders}}</ref>  At the time of the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], inflation had been at 9% or under for the previous year, having decreased under Callaghan, then increased to over 20% in the first two years of the Thatcher ministry, but it had fallen again to 5.8% by the start of 1983 (it continued to be under 7% until 1990).<ref>{{cite web|title=Consumer Price Indices – RPI annual percentage change: 1948 to 2014|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/datasets-and-tables/data-selector.html?cdid=CZBI&dataset=mm23&table-id=2.2|author=Office for National Statistics|publisher=UK Government|date=13 January 2015|access-date=13 January 2015|author-link=Office for National Statistics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213013820/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/datasets-and-tables/data-selector.html?cdid=CZBI&dataset=mm23&table-id=2.2|archive-date=13 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>  The British economy benefitted in the first Thatcher ministry by tax income from [[North Sea oil]] coming on stream.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26326117|work=BBC News|title=North Sea oil: Facts and figures|date=24 February 2014|access-date=13 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416053209/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26326117|archive-date=16 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The period of unpopularity of the Conservatives in the early 1980s coincided with a crisis in the Labour Party, which then formed the main opposition. The [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) was established in 1981 and consisted of more than twenty breakaway Labour MPs, who quickly formed the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] with the Liberal Party. By the turn of 1982, the SDP-Liberal Alliance was ahead of the Conservatives in the [[opinion poll]]s, but victory in the [[Falklands War]] in June that year, along with the recovering British economy, saw the Conservatives returning quickly to the top of the opinion polls and winning the 1983 general election with a landslide majority, due to a split opposition vote.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" />

Thatcher now faced, arguably, her most serious rival yet after the 1983 general election, when [[Michael Foot]] resigned as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and was succeeded by [[Neil Kinnock]]. With a new leader at the helm, Labour were clearly determined to defeat the Conservatives at the next election, and for virtually the entirety of Thatcher's second ministry, it was looking a very serious possibility, as the lead in the opinion polls constantly saw a change in leadership from the Conservatives to Labour, with the Alliance occasionally scraping into first place.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|work=BBC News|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|date=29 September 2009|accessdate=1 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217050955/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|archive-date=17 December 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

By the time of the general election in June 1987, the economy was stronger, with lower inflation and falling unemployment and Thatcher secured her third successive electoral victory with a second, albeit reduced, landslide majority.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393315.stm|work=BBC News|title=1987: Thatcher's third victory|date=5 April 2005|accessdate=1 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422033842/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393315.stm|archive-date=22 April 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

The introduction of the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (known by its opponents as the ''[[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]'') in 1989 is often cited as contributing to her political downfall. The summer of 1989 saw her fall behind Neil Kinnock's Labour in the opinion polls for the first time since 1986, and her party's fall in popularity continued into 1990. By the second half of that year, opinion polls were showing that Labour had a lead of up to 16 points over the Conservatives, and they faced a tough 18 months ahead of them if they were to prevent Kinnock's ambition to become Prime Minister from becoming a reality. At the same time, the economy was sliding into [[Early 1990s recession|another recession]].<ref name="autogenerated2" />

Internal party tensions led to a leadership challenge by the Conservative MP [[Michael Heseltine]]; and, after months of speculation about her future as Prime Minister, she resigned on 28 November 1990, making way for a new Conservative leader more likely to win the next general election in the interests of party unity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/22/newsid_2549000/2549189.stm |work=BBC News |title=On This Day 1990: Thatcher quits as prime minister |date=22 November 1990 |accessdate=1 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307114202/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/22/newsid_2549000/2549189.stm |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===John Major (1990–1997)===
[[File:John Major 1996.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Major]], Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1990–1997)]]
[[John Major]] won the party leadership election on 27 November 1990, and his appointment led to an almost immediate boost in Conservative Party fortunes. A MORI poll six days before [[Resignation of Margaret Thatcher|Mrs Thatcher's resignation]] had shown the Conservatives to be 11 points behind Labour, but within two months the Conservatives had returned to the top of the opinion polls with a narrow lead.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

A general election had to be held within the next eighteen months and the UK economy was sliding into [[Early 1990s|recession]], but 1991 was a year of electoral uncertainty as the Conservatives and Labour regularly swapped places at the top of the opinion polls, and Major resisted Neil Kinnock's numerous calls for an immediate election.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

The [[1992 United Kingdom general election|election]] was finally held on 9 April 1992 and the Conservatives won a fourth successive electoral victory, even though the economy was still in recession and most of the polls had predicted either a narrow Labour victory or a [[hung parliament]]. Major's vigorous campaigning, notably his claim that the UK would have higher prices and higher taxes under a Labour government, was seen to have been crucial to his election win (in which he became the first—and as of 2015, only—Prime Minister to attract 14,000,000 votes in a general election), as was a high-profile campaign by the newspaper the ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' against Labour leader Neil Kinnock, who resigned in the aftermath of the election to be succeeded by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. The Conservative Party also touched upon the issue of immigration, claiming that under Labour, immigration would rise hugely.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm|work=BBC News|title=1992: Tories win again against odds|date=5 April 2005|access-date=1 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422045259/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm|archive-date=22 April 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

The UK economy was deep in recession by this stage and remained so until the end of the year. The [[pound sterling]] was forced out of the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] on 16 September 1992, a day thereafter referred to as ''[[Black Wednesday]]''.

Soon after, approximately one million householders faced repossession of their homes during a recession that saw a sharp rise in unemployment, taking it close to 3,000,000 people. The party subsequently lost much of its reputation for good financial stewardship although the end of the recession was declared in April 1993<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm|work=BBC News|title=1993: Recession over&nbsp;– it's official|date=26 April 1993|access-date=1 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916043238/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm|archive-date=16 September 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> bringing economic recovery and a fall in unemployment.

The party was plagued by internal division and infighting, mainly over the UK's role in the [[European Union]]. The party's [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Eurosceptic]] wing, represented by MPs such as [[John Redwood]], opposed further EU integration, whilst the party's pro-European wing, represented by those such as Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Kenneth Clarke]], was broadly supportive. The issue of the creation of a single European currency also inflamed tensions, and these would continue to dog the party until the early-2000s (decade).{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Major also had to survive a leadership challenge in 1995 by the Secretary of State for Wales, the aforementioned John Redwood. Major survived, but Redwood received 89 votes from MPs, as well as the backing of the ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' newspaper, which described the choice as being between "Redwood or Deadwood". This further undermined Major's influence in the Conservative Party.<ref>The Conservative Party – From Thatcher to Cameron</ref>

The Conservative government was also increasingly accused in the media of "[[Political scandals in the United Kingdom|sleaze]]". Their support reached its lowest ebb in late 1994, after the sudden death of Labour Party leader John Smith and the election of [[Tony Blair]] as his successor, when Labour had up to 60% of the vote in opinion polls and had a lead of some 30 points ahead of the Conservatives. The Labour lead was gradually narrowed over the next two years, as the Conservatives gained some credit for the strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment. But as the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] loomed, despite their high-profile [[New Labour, New Danger]] campaign, it was still looking certain that Labour would win.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

An effective opposition campaign by the Labour Party culminated in a landslide defeat for the Conservatives in 1997 that was Labour's largest ever parliamentary victory and the worst defeat for the Conservatives since the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]] 91 years earlier. The [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] left the Conservative Party as an England-only party, with all Scottish and Welsh seats having been lost, and not a single new seat having been gained anywhere.

=== Political wilderness (1997–2010) ===

==== William Hague ====
[[John Major]] resigned as party leader after the Conservatives were heavily defeated in a landslide and was succeeded by [[William Hague]]. Though Hague was a strong orator, a [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup poll]] for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' found that two-thirds of voters regarded him as "a bit of a wally",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/1162569.stm |title=Poll monitor: Labour looks hard to beat |accessdate=20 April 2007 |first=David |last=Cowling |date=9 February 2001 |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312082816/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/1162569.stm |archive-date=12 March 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> for headlines such as his claim that he drank 14 pints of beer in a single day in his youth. He was also criticised for attending the [[Notting Hill Carnival]] and for wearing a [[baseball cap]] in public in what were seen as poor attempts to appeal to younger voters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2823679.stm |title=Trying to be 'down with the kids' |accessdate=20 April 2007 |date=7 March 2003 |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313094240/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2823679.stm |archive-date=13 March 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Shortly before the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Hague was much maligned for a speech in which he predicted that a re-elected Labour government would turn the UK into a "foreign land".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1200842.stm|title=Tory critics round on Hague|accessdate=20 April 2007|date=5 March 2001|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312070306/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1200842.stm|archive-date=12 March 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> The BBC also reported that the Conservative peer [[John Taylor, Baron Taylor of Warwick|John Lord Taylor]] criticised Hague for not removing the whip from [[John Townend]], a Conservative MP, after the latter made a speech in which he said the British were becoming "a mongrel race", although Hague did reject Townend's views.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1298786.stm |title=Tory peer attacks Hague over race |accessdate=20 April 2007 |date=27 April 2001 |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313103609/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1298786.stm |archive-date=13 March 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] resulted in a net gain of just one seat for the Conservative Party, just months after the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests of September 2000]] had seen the Conservatives briefly take a narrow lead over Labour in the opinion polls.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

Having privately set himself a target of 209 seats,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} matching Labour's performance in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]—a target he missed by 43—[[William Hague]] resigned soon after.

==== Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard ====
[[Iain Duncan Smith]] (2001–2003) (often known as IDS or simply: "Duncan Smith") is a strong [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]], but the issue did not define Duncan Smith's leadership, though during his tenure, Europe ceased to be an issue of division in the party as it united behind calls for a referendum on the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Union Constitution]].

However, before he could lead the party into a general election, Duncan Smith lost the vote on a [[motion of no confidence]] by MPs who felt that the party would not be returned to government under his leadership. This was despite the Conservative support equalling that of Labour in the months leading up to his departure from the leadership.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

[[Michael Howard]] then [[2003 Conservative Party leadership election|stood for the leadership unopposed]] on 6 November 2003.

Under Howard's leadership in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], the Conservative Party increased their total vote share by around 0.7% (up to 32.4%) and—more significantly—their number of parliamentary seats by 33 (up to 198 seats). This gain accompanied a large decline in the Labour vote, and the election reduced Labour's majority from 167 to 68 and its share of the vote to 35.2%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukpolitical.info/2005.htm|title=2005 General election results summary|work=UK Political Info|access-date=30 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223235535/http://www.ukpolitical.info/2005.htm|archive-date=23 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The campaign, based on the slogan "[[Are you thinking what we're thinking?]]", was designed by Australian pollster [[Lynton Crosby]]. The day following the election, on 6 May, Howard announced that he did not feel it was right to continue as leader after defeat in the general election, also saying that he would be too old to lead the party into another campaign and would therefore step down after allowing time for the party to amend its leadership election rules.

===David Cameron (2005–2016)===
{{Further|Political positions of David Cameron|Premiership of David Cameron}}

[[David Cameron]] won the [[2005 Conservative Party leadership election|2005 leadership election]]. Cameron defeated his closest rival, [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], by a margin of more than two to one, taking 134,446 votes to 64,398. He then announced his intention to reform and realign the Conservatives, saying they needed to change the way they looked, felt, thought and behaved, advocating a more centre-right stance as opposed to their recent staunchly right-wing platform.<ref name="Cameron-speech">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/dec/06/toryleadership2005.conservatives3 |title=Full text of David Cameron's victory speech |accessdate=20 April 2007 |date=12 June 2005 |work=The Guardian |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112141018/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/dec/06/toryleadership2005.conservatives3 |archive-date=12 January 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although Cameron's views are probably to the left of the party membership and he sought to make the Conservative brand more attractive to young, socially liberal voters,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8131792.stm |work=BBC News |title=Minister in Tory homophobia claim |first=Brian |last=Wheeler |date=3 July 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}</ref> he has also expressed his admiration for [[Margaret Thatcher]], describing himself as a "big fan of Thatcher's", though he questions whether that makes him a "Thatcherite".

Polls became more volatile in summer 2007 with the accession of [[Gordon Brown]] as Prime Minister, although polls gave the Conservatives a lead after October of that year and, by May 2008, with the UK's economy sliding into [[Great Recession|its first recession since 1992]]. The Conservatives gained control of the London [[Mayor of London|mayoralty]] for the first time in May 2008 after [[Boris Johnson]] defeated the Labour incumbent, [[Ken Livingstone]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=144004 |title= Boris is the new Mayor of London |date=3 May 2008 |publisher=Conservative Party |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080506110344/http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=144004 |archivedate= 6 May 2008}}</ref>

The Conservative lead in the opinion polls had been almost unbroken for nearly three years when Britain finally went to the polls on 6 May 2010, though since the turn of 2010 most polls had shown the Conservative lead as less than 10 points wide. The election resulted in a [[hung parliament]] with the Conservatives having the most seats (306) but being twenty seats short of an overall majority. Following the resignation of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party five days afterwards, David Cameron was named the country's new Prime Minister, and the Conservatives [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|entered government in a coalition]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]—the first postwar [[coalition government]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/ |work= BBC News |title= Election 2010 results |accessdate= 12 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100414102452/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/ |archive-date= 14 April 2010 |url-status= live }}</ref>

In May 2014, the Conservatives were defeated in the [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European parliamentary elections]], coming in third place behind the [[UK Independence Party]] and Labour. UKIP ended with 24 MEPs, Labour 20, and the Conservatives 19. The result was described by UKIP leader [[Nigel Farage]] as "disastrous" for Cameron, and the leaders of the other main parties.<ref name="UKIP">{{cite news|title=European voters now calling for less EU|url=http://www.theuknews.com/index.php/sid/222314307/scat/b8de8e630faf3631/ht/European-voters-now-calling-for-less-EU|accessdate=27 May 2014|publisher=The UK News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528064810/http://www.theuknews.com/index.php/sid/222314307/scat/b8de8e630faf3631/ht/European-voters-now-calling-for-less-EU|archive-date=28 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In September 2014, the Unionist side, championed by Labour as well as by the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats, won in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish Independence referendum]] by 55% No to 45% Yes on the question "Should Scotland be an independent country". This can be seen as a victory for [[British Unionism]], a core part of traditional Conservative ideology, and also for David Cameron as the incumbent Prime Minister.

At the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], the Conservatives won a majority of seats in the House of Commons and formed a majority government under David Cameron. The party increased its national vote share, becoming the first incumbent party to do so since 1900. The result was unexpected and exceeded even the party leadership's expectations, as most polls had predicted a hung parliament.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11591281/conservative-government-live.html|title=Election 2015: Ed Miliband resigns as Conservatives win stunning majority|date=8 May 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=8 May 2015|last1=Holehouse|first1=Rosa Prince Matthew|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513215954/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11591281/conservative-government-live.html|archive-date=13 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32633099|title=Election results: Conservatives win majority|date=8 May 2015|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508005155/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32633099|archive-date=8 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> This was also the first general election since 1992 in which the Conservatives had won an overall majority, although the vote share of 36.9% was lower than the previous four Conservative majority governments under Thatcher and Major.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/db4d60b2-f574-11e4-bc6d-00144feab7de.html#axzz4ACNy4msM | title=It is 1992 all over again for David Cameron's Conservatives | publisher=[[The Nikkei|Nikkei]] | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=8 May 2015 | accessdate=31 May 2016 | author=Parker, George | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625075156/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/db4d60b2-f574-11e4-bc6d-00144feab7de.html#axzz4ACNy4msM | archive-date=25 June 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> In March 2017, the party was fined £70,000, the largest fine of this sort in British political history, after an [[Electoral Commission]] investigation found "significant failures" by the party to report its [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] campaign spending.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/16/conservatives-fined-70000-for-campaign-spending-failures|title=Conservatives fined record £70,000 for campaign spending failures|first1=Jessica|last1=Elgot|first2=Rowena|last2=Mason|date=16 March 2017|access-date=4 April 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404100936/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/16/conservatives-fined-70000-for-campaign-spending-failures|archive-date=4 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

May's early cabinet appointments were interpreted both as "centrist and conciliatory", an effort to reunite the party in the wake of the UK's [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|vote to leave the European Union]], and as "a shift to the right" according to ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister|title=Theresa May appeals to centre ground but cabinet tilts to the right|first=Heather Stewart Political|last=editor|date=13 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713235732/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister|archive-date=13 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 2017, the Cabinet agreed to hold a [[2017 United Kingdom general election|general election]] on 8 June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xr9-CkZZRk|title=Theresa May seeks general election|date=18 April 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=11 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611060324/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xr9-CkZZRk|archive-date=11 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> During the resulting campaign, Theresa May asked the electorate to "strengthen my hand" in [[Brexit]] negotiations, promised "strong and stable leadership in the national interest" and warned of a "coalition of chaos" under Jeremy Corbyn.

Contrary to opinion polling at the time, the election resulted in a [[hung parliament]], with the Conservative Party having 317 seats in the House of Commons, but without an overall majority. The [[Democratic Unionist Party]] suggested it would be able to provide a [[Conservative–DUP agreement|confidence and supply]] arrangement depending on negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/suddenly-become-important-democratic-unionist-party-could-hold/|title=Who are the DUP and will they demand a soft Brexit to prop up the Tories?|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=9 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609084123/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/suddenly-become-important-democratic-unionist-party-could-hold/|archive-date=9 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> On 9 June 2017, May announced her intention to form a new [[Second May ministry|minority government]] with support from the DUP,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2017/general-election-2017-result-live-we-will-work-with-dup-friends-and-allies-in-interests-of-all-uk-says-theresa-may-35806871.html|title=General Election 2017 result live: We will work with DUP friends and allies in interests of all UK, says Theresa May|last=|first=|date=9 June 2017|work=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=9 June 2017|publisher=}}</ref> which was finalised on 26 June.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/dup-and-conservatives-make-confidence-and-supply-deal-10927704|title=DUP and Conservatives make confidence and supply deal worth £1.5bn|work=Sky News|access-date=21 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421233342/https://news.sky.com/story/dup-and-conservatives-make-confidence-and-supply-deal-10927704|archive-date=21 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 8 January 2018, May announced her first major cabinet reshuffle, keeping in place most ministers, but promoting others.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42619018|title=Cabinet meets as reshuffle continues|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109102650/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42619018|archive-date=9 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 2019, three Conservative MPs – [[Heidi Allen]], [[Sarah Wollaston]], and [[Anna Soubry]] – defected from the party to join the [[The Independent Group|Independent Group]], a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-EU]] political association of [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MPs]] founded by seven former members of the Labour party. The MPs said the reasons for their departure were their opposition to the party's handling of Brexit, what they saw as the takeover of the Conservative party by 'right wing, ... hard-line anti-EU' MPs, and lack of concern from the Conservative party for the 'most vulnerable in society'.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/tory-mps-defect-independent-group-soubry-allen-wollaston |title=Three Conservative MPs to defect to Independent Group |date=20 February 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=20 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503022623/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/tory-mps-defect-independent-group-soubry-allen-wollaston |archive-date=3 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47306022|title=Three Tory MPs join Labour breakaway group|work=[[BBC News]]|date=20 February 2019|access-date=20 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220112519/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47306022|archive-date=20 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

May announced her resignation from the leadership of the Conservative party on 24 May 2019, intending to leave the role on 7 June. However, she remained Prime Minister until a successor was elected by the party.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Theresa May resigns over Brexit: What happened?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48379730|work=BBC News|access-date=26 May 2019|date=24 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526033012/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48379730|archive-date=26 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Theresa May resigned as Prime Minister on 24 July 2019 after her successor, [[Boris Johnson]], was elected on 23 July 2019. She remained as the Member of Parliament for the Parliamentary Constituency of [[Maidenhead]] and won re-election for a further term as backbencher in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|December general election]].

In July 2019, former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]] defeated Foreign Secretary [[Jeremy Hunt]], with 66% of the vote in the final ballot of Conservative Party members, to become Leader of the Conservative Party.<ref name='bbc230719'>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49084605|title=Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM|website=BBC News|date=23 July 2019|access-date=23 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191130125915/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49084605|archive-date=30 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> He became Prime Minister the next day.

Johnson lost his working majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 3 September 2019 when former Justice minister [[Phillip Lee (politician)|Phillip Lee]] crossed the floor during Johnson's speech to join the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], later explaining that he believed the Conservative party had been "infected with the twin diseases of [[populism]] and [[English nationalism]]".<ref name='bbc030919'>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49570682|title=Brexit: Tory MP defects ahead of crucial no deal vote|website=BBC News|date=3 September 2019|access-date=3 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903145348/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49570682|archive-date=3 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|website=The Standard|title=Phillip Lee quits Tories: Boris Johnson loses working majority after Bracknell MP defects to Lib Dems|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tory-mp-philip-lee-defects-to-lib-dems-meaning-boris-johnson-no-longer-has-working-majority-a4228151.html|date=3 September 2019|access-date=3 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903154040/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tory-mp-philip-lee-defects-to-lib-dems-meaning-boris-johnson-no-longer-has-working-majority-a4228151.html|archive-date=3 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The same day, the former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Philip Hammond]] announced that he would "defend his party" against "incomers and [[Entryism|entryists]]", perceived by some as referring to Johnson's adviser [[Dominic Cummings]].<ref>{{Cite web|website=BBC News|title=Hammond: 'I am going to defend my party'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-49563297/philip-hammond-i-am-going-to-defend-my-party|date=3 September 2019|access-date=3 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903171636/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-49563297/philip-hammond-i-am-going-to-defend-my-party|archive-date=3 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Later that same day, [[September 2019 suspension of rebel Conservative MPs|21 Conservative MPs had the Conservative whip withdrawn]] after voting with the Opposition to grant the House of Commons control over its order paper, leading to Johnson becoming the first Prime Minister to lose his first Commons vote.<ref>{{Cite web|website=BBC News|title=Brexit showdown: Who were Tory rebels who defied Boris Johnson?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49563357|date=3 September 2019|access-date=3 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903235045/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49563357|archive-date=3 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Subsequent votes in the Commons effected the passing of the [[European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019|Benn Act]], which Prime Minister Johnson controversially dubbed the 'Surrender Act'.<ref>{{Cite web|website=Reuters|title=PM Johnson defends use of Brexit 'surrender act'|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-johnson-1922/pm-johnson-defends-use-of-brexit-surrender-act-idUKKBN1WB1BM|date=17 December 2019|access-date=18 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218004042/https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-johnson-1922/pm-johnson-defends-use-of-brexit-surrender-act-idUKKBN1WB1BM|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Act required the Prime Minister to request a formal extension to [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] if a new withdrawal agreement had not been approved by Parliament by 19 October 2019. After having agreed a revised withdrawal agreement (WA) with the European Union on 17 October,<ref>{{Cite web|website=The Independent|title=Boris Johnson agrees Brexit deal with EU|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brexit-deal-boris-johnson-news-today-latest-eu-a9159606.html|date=17 December 2019|access-date=18 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218004044/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brexit-deal-boris-johnson-news-today-latest-eu-a9159606.html|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the Government put a motion before the House of Commons in a rare Saturday sitting on 19 October. This motion requested approval for the revised WA, such that the Benn Act would have been satisfied and no extension to Article 50 would be legally required. An amendment to the motion was passed, withholding formal approval of the WA until all the necessary legislation had been passed by Parliament. The following week, the full [[European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill 2019–20|Withdrawal Agreement Bill]] (WAB) was introduced. It passed a second reading, but the [[Cloture|programme motion]] for the bill put forward by the Government was voted down. This meant that there was no guarantee that the legislation would be passed in time to allow the United Kingdom to legally withdraw from the European Union (EU) on 31 October. Johnson had made withdrawal from the EU by this date "with no ifs, buts or maybes" a key pledge during [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|his campaign for the leadership of the Conservative Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|website=BBC News|title=Boris Johnson in 'deal or no deal' Brexit challenge to rival Hunt|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48756819|date=17 December 2019|access-date=18 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730114835/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48756819|archive-date=30 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Johnson then immediately halted the WAB, and then called for a general election to be held. He made clear his view that Parliament was "...refusing to deliver Brexit. It's impossible to deliver legislation. It's time, frankly, the opposition summoned up the nerve to submit themselves to the judgment of our collective boss, which is the UK."<ref>{{cite news|work=The Guardian|title=Johnson seeks 12 December election after shelving 'do or die' Brexit pledge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/boris-johnson-to-ask-mps-to-back-pre-christmas-election|date=17 December 2019|access-date=18 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209213031/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/boris-johnson-to-ask-mps-to-back-pre-christmas-election|archive-date=9 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> After failing to gain the necessary support of two-thirds of all MPs to call an election under the provisions of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|Fixed-term Parliaments Act]], the Government indicated its intention to pass a short bill requiring only a simple majority of votes to hold such an election. The [[Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019|early parliamentary general election act]] was passed on 29 October 2019 and specified that a general election was to be held on 12 December 2019. [[2019 United Kingdom general election|This election]] resulted in Johnson's Conservatives winning of a majority of 80 seats in the House of Commons, a significant improvement on their 2017 result, and indeed the Party's largest majority since [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], under Thatcher.<ref name='bbc131219'>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2019/results|title=UK results: Conservatives win majority|website=BBC News|date=13 December 2019|access-date=13 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213002620/https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2019/results|archive-date=13 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The party won several constituencies, especially in [[Northern England]] but also in the [[Midlands]] and [[North Wales]] (often dubbed Labour's [[Red Wall (British politics)|Red Wall]]), that the party had either never won before or had not produced a Tory majority in several decades.

{{Conservatism sidebar}}

=== Economic policy ===
The Conservative Party believes that free markets and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity.
A leading economic theory advocated by Conservatives is supply-side economics, this theory holds that reduced income tax rates increase GDP growth and thereby generate the same or more revenue for the government from the smaller tax on the extra growth. This belief is reflected, in part, by the advocacy of tax cuts. The party has recently focused on the [[social market economy]] in Britain, promoting a free market for competition with social balance to create fairness. This has included curbs on the banking sector, enterprise zones to revive regions in Britain and grand infrastructure projects such as high-speed rail.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d45ed5c6-842b-11e3-b72e-00144feab7de|title=The death and life of Britain's market economy|author=|date=24 January 2014|newspaper=Financial Times|access-date=18 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218201956/https://www.ft.com/content/d45ed5c6-842b-11e3-b72e-00144feab7de|archive-date=18 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/860969/The-case-for-social-market-capitalism-must-be-made-once-again|title=The case for social market capitalism must be made once again, says Sir Oliver Letwin|first=Oliver|last=Letwin|date=1 October 2017|newspaper=Express|access-date=18 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218202017/https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/860969/The-case-for-social-market-capitalism-must-be-made-once-again|archive-date=18 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

One concrete economic policy of recent years has been opposition to the European single currency, the [[euro]]. With the growing [[Euroscepticism]] within his party, [[John Major]] negotiated a British opt-out in the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]], which enabled the UK to stay within the European Union without adopting the single currency. However, several members of Major's cabinet, such as [[Kenneth Clarke]], were personally supportive of EMU participation. Following Major's resignation after the 1997 election defeat, all subsequent Conservative leaders have positioned the party firmly against the adoption of the [[euro]].

Following Labour's victory in the 1997 general election, the Conservative Party opposed Labour's decision to grant the [[Bank of England]] independent control of interest rates—on the grounds that it would be a prelude to the abolition of the [[pound sterling]] and acceptance of the European single currency, and also expressed concern over the removal of monetary policy from democratic control. However, Bank independence was popular amongst the financial community as it helped to keep inflation low.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_economy/404098.stm| title = Business: The Economy – Labour's economic record| accessdate = 20 April 2007| date = 26 July 1999| work = BBC News| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170731205209/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_economy/404098.stm| archive-date = 31 July 2017| url-status = live}}</ref> The Conservatives accepted Labour's policy in early 2000.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/629601.stm |title= Portillo springs surprise U-turns |accessdate= 20 April 2007 |date= 3 February 2000 |work= BBC News |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20030728053740/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/629601.stm |archive-date= 28 July 2003 |url-status= live }}</ref>

This program became increasing unpopular and as a result, during the 2019 election campaign, now incumbent Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson signalled an end to austerity with promises to restore 20,000 police officers from those previously cut and increase public investment in the NHS, amongst other anti-austerity promises.

=== Social policy ===
[[File:ScarboroughConservativeClub.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] Conservative Club]]
Since the election of [[David Cameron]] as party leader, the Conservative Party has distanced itself from association with [[social conservatism]]. Socially conservative policies such as tax incentives for married couples and the belief that benefits for those out of work should be reduced may have played a role in the party's electoral decline in the 1990s and early 2000s, and so the party has attempted to seek a new direction. The introduction of equal marriage rights for LGBT+ individuals in 2010 can be said to have represented a shift away from social conservatism, though the extent to which this policy truly represented a more 'liberal' Conservative party has been challenged.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hayton|first1=Richard|last2=McEnhill|first2=Libby|date=20 April 2015|title=Cameron's Conservative Party, social liberalism and social justice|journal=British Politics|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147|doi=10.1057/bp.2015.19|s2cid=153581022|issn=1746-918X|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/85297/3/Cameron%E2%80%99s%20Conservative%20Party%20social%20liberalism%20and%20social%20justice.pdf|access-date=4 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722134514/http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/85297/3/Cameron%E2%80%99s%20Conservative%20Party%20social%20liberalism%20and%20social%20justice.pdf|archive-date=22 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Foreign policy ===
[[File:Reagan's - Thatcher's c50515-16.jpg|thumb|[[Margaret Thatcher]] (second left), [[Ronald Reagan]] (far left) and their respective spouses in 1988. Thatcher and Reagan developed a close relationship against the Soviet Union.]]
For much of the 20th century, the Conservative Party took a broadly [[Atlanticist]] stance in relations with the United States, favouring close ties with the United States and similarly aligned nations such as Canada, Australia and Japan. The Conservatives have generally favoured a diverse range of international alliances, ranging from the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

Close [[United Kingdom–United States relations|US-British relations]] have been an element of Conservative foreign policy since World War II. Winston Churchill during his 1951–1955 post-war premiership built up a strong relationship with the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower Administration]] in the United States. Harold Macmillan demonstrated a similarly close relationship with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] administration of [[John F. Kennedy]]. Though the US–British relationship in foreign affairs has often been termed a '[[Special Relationship]]', a term coined by [[Winston Churchill]], this has often been observed most clearly where leaders in each country are of a similar political stripe. The former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher built a close relationship with the American President [[Ronald Reagan]] in his opposition to the former Soviet Union, but [[John Major]] was less successful in his personal contacts with [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Out of power and perceived as largely irrelevant by American politicians, Conservative leaders Hague, Duncan-Smith, and Howard each struggled to forge personal relationships with presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W.

Beyond relations with the United States, the Commonwealth and the EU, the Conservative Party has generally supported a pro free-trade foreign policy within the mainstream of international affairs. The degree to which Conservative Governments have supported [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] or non-interventionist presidents in the US has often varied with the personal relations between the US president and the British prime minister.

Although stances have changed with successive leadership, the modern Conservative Party generally supports cooperation and maintaining friendly relations with the [[State of Israel]]. Historic Conservative statesmen such as [[Arthur Balfour]] and [[Winston Churchill]] supported the idea of national home for the Jewish people. Under [[Margaret Thatcher]] Conservative support for Israel was seen to crystallize.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fathomjournal.org/the-new-special-relationship-the-british-conservative-party-and-israel/|title=The New Special Relationship: The British Conservative Party and Israel|website=Fathom}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bod.org.uk/political-party-manifestos-where-they-stand-on-issues-of-jewish-interest/|title=Board of Deputies – Political party manifestos- where they stand on issues of Jewish interest|website=www.bod.org.uk}}</ref> Support for Israel has increased under the leaderships of [[Theresa May]] and [[Boris Johnson]], with prominent Conservative figures within the May and Johnson ministries such as [[Priti Patel]], [[Robert Jenrick]], [[Michael Gove]] and [[Sajid Javid]] strongly endorsing Israel.

Since the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001]], the Conservative Party has supported the coalition military action in [[Afghanistan]].

==== Strategic Defence and Security Review ====

The Conservative Party believes that in the 21st century defence and security are interlinked. It has pledged to break away from holding a traditional [[Strategic Defence Review]] and have committed to carrying out a more comprehensive [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Strategic Defence and Security Review]] (SDSR) immediately upon coming into office. This review will include both defence and homeland security related matters. The Labour Government last conducted a review in 1998. To prevent a long gap in the future it also pledged to hold regular defence reviews every 4–5&nbsp;years, and if necessary will put this requirement into legislation. Party officials claim that the SDSR will be a major improvement, and will ensure that Britain maintains generic and flexible capability to adapt to any changing threats. It will be a cross-departmental review that will begin with foreign policy priorities and will bring together all the levers of domestic national security policy with overseas interests and defence priorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2009/09/Liam_Fox_If_Afghanistan_will_be_lost_it_will_be_lost_at_home.aspx |title=The Strategic Defence and Security Review: A Conservative View of Defence and Future Challenges |publisher=Royal United Services Institute |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=8 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622051413/https://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2009/09/Liam_Fox_If_Afghanistan_will_be_lost_it_will_be_lost_at_home.aspx |archivedate=22 June 2011 }}</ref>

As well as an SDSR, the Conservative Party pledged in 2010 to undertake a fundamental and far-reaching review of the procurement process and how defence equipment is provided in Britain. It pledged to reform the procurement process, compile a Green Paper on Sovereignty Capability, and publish another Defence Industrial Strategy following on from the Defence Industrial Strategy in 2005. The Conservative Party has said that there will be four aims for British defence procurement: to provide the best possible equipment at the best possible price; to streamline the procurement process to ensure the speedy delivery of equipment to the front line; to support our industry jobs at home by increasing defence exports; to provide defence procurement that underpins strategic relationships abroad and; to provide predictability to the defence industry.

The Conservative Party also pledged to increase Britain's share of the global defence market as Government policy.

==== Europe and NATO ====

The Conservative Party aims to build enhanced bilateral defence relations with key European partners and believes that it is in Britain's national interest to cooperate fully with all its European neighbours. It has pledged to ensure that any EU military capability must supplement and not supplant British national defence and [[NATO]], and that it is not in the British interest to hand over security to any supranational body.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2010/02/Liam_Fox_EU_should_only_act_when_NATO_cannot.aspx |title=The EU should only act when NATO cannot |date=11 February 2010 |last=Fox |first=Liam |accessdate=4 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401061150/http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2010/02/Liam_Fox_EU_should_only_act_when_NATO_cannot.aspx |archivedate=1 April 2010 }}</ref>

The Conservatives see it as a priority to encourage all members of the European Union to do more in terms of a commitment to European security at home and abroad.<!-- They should better first encourage themselves to stay in the EU! -->

Regarding the defence role of the European Union, the Conservatives pledged to re-examine some of Britain's EU Defence commitments to determine their practicality and utility; specifically, to reassess UK participation provisions like Permanent Structured Cooperation, the [[European Defence Agency]] and EU Battlegroups to determine if there is any value in Britain's participation.

The Conservative Party upholds the view that NATO should remain the most important security alliance for the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2010/02/Liam_Fox_EU_should_only_act_when_NATO_cannot.aspx |title=Liam Fox: The EU should only act when NATO cannot |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2007 |publisher=Conservative Party |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401061150/http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2010/02/Liam_Fox_EU_should_only_act_when_NATO_cannot.aspx |archivedate=1 April 2010 }}</ref> It believes that NATO, which has been the cornerstone of British security for the past 60&nbsp;years, should continue to have primacy on all issues relating to Europe's defence, and pledged in 2010 to make NATO reform a key strategic priority.

It has also called on the so-called fighting/funding gap to be changed and have called on the creation of a fairer funding mechanism for NATO's expeditionary operations. As well as this, the Conservatives believe that there is scope for expanding NATO's Article V to include new 21st Century threats such as energy and cybersecurity.

==== Nuclear weapons ====
The 2010 manifesto said the Conservatives will maintain Britain's continuous at sea, independent, submarine based strategic nuclear deterrent based on the [[Trident nuclear programme|Trident missile system]].<ref name="autogenerated1" />

=== Health policy ===
In 1945, the Conservatives declared support for universal healthcare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/con45.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919151718/http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/con45.htm|archive-date=19 September 2011|title=British Conservative Party election manifesto, 1945|website=Politicsresources.net|date=22 October 2012}}</ref> Since entering office in 2010, they have introduced the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|Health and Social Care Act]], constituting the biggest reformation that the NHS has ever undertaken. However, there has been much criticism and protest about the 2010 government's actions on the NHS, focussing on budget cuts and privatisation of services. After a 2013 [[Trades union|union]] protest said by police to have been one of the largest protests seen in Manchester, the general secretary of the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) said that austerity was having a devastating effect, with 21,000 NHS jobs lost over the previous three months alone, and that "The NHS is one of Britain's finest achievements and we will not allow ministers to destroy, through cuts and privatisation, what has taken generations to build." The Department of Health responded that there was "absolutely no government policy to privatise NHS services".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-24286582|title=50,000 march in NHS cuts protest in Manchester|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 September 2013|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217211230/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-24286582|archive-date=17 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Drug policies ===
Views on drug legality and policing vary greatly within the Conservative Party. Some Conservative politicians such as [[Alan Duncan]] and [[Crispin Blunt]] take the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] approach that individual freedom and economic freedom of industry and trade should be respected. Other Conservative politicians, despite being [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]], are in favour of full [[Prohibition of drugs|prohibition of the ownership and trade of many drugs]]. Other Conservatives are in the middle ground, favouring stances such as looser regulation and [[Drug decriminalization|decriminalisation]] of some drugs. Legalisation of [[Medical cannabis|cannabis for medical uses]] is favoured by some Conservative politicians, including [[Boris Johnson]].<ref>Johnson, Boris (24 April 2008).

=== Education and research ===
In education, the Conservatives have pledged to review the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]], and introduce the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education#English Baccalaureate|English Baccalaureate]]. The restoration of discipline was also highlighted, as they want it to be easier for pupils to be searched for contraband items, the granting of anonymity to teachers accused by pupils, and the banning of expelled pupils being returned to schools via appeal panels.

In Higher education, the Conservatives have increased tuition fees to £9,250 per year, however have ensured that this will not be paid by anyone until they are earning over £25,000. The Scottish Conservatives also support the re-introduction of tuition fees in Scotland. In 2016 the Conservative government extended student loan access in England to postgraduate students to help improve access to education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3fb9b3b8-eb8b-11e5-bb79-2303682345c8|title=Subscribe to read|author=|date=|work=FT.com|access-date=4 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150151/https://www.ft.com/content/3fb9b3b8-eb8b-11e5-bb79-2303682345c8|archive-date=27 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Within the EU, the UK is one of the largest recipients of research funding in the [[European Union]], receiving £7&nbsp;billion between 2007 and 2015, which is invested in universities and research-intensive businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/uk-research-and-european-union/role-of-EU-in-funding-UK-research/how-much-funding-does-uk-get-in-comparison-with-other-countries/|title=How much research funding does the UK get from the EU and how does this compare with other countries?|author=|date=|work=RoyalSociety.org|access-date=4 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152354/https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/uk-research-and-european-union/role-of-EU-in-funding-UK-research/how-much-funding-does-uk-get-in-comparison-with-other-countries/|archive-date=27 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the vote to leave the EU, Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] guaranteed that the Conservative government would protect funding for existing research and development projects in the UK.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/uk-government-gives-brexit-science-funding-guarantee-1.20434|title=UK government gives Brexit science funding guarantee|first=Daniel|last=Cressey|journal=Nature|access-date=4 April 2017|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20434|year=2016|s2cid=168424106|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402023208/http://www.nature.com/news/uk-government-gives-brexit-science-funding-guarantee-1.20434|archive-date=2 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In autumn 2017 the Conservatives decided to introduce the [[T Level]] qualification aimed at improving the teaching and administration of technical education.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/education-secretary-announces-first-new-t-levels |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708064417/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/education-secretary-announces-first-new-t-levels |archive-date=8 July 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Family policy===
As prime minister, [[David Cameron]] wanted to 'support family life in Britain' and put families at the centre of domestic social policymaking.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/david-cameron-on-families|title=David Cameron on families|work=GOV.UK|access-date=30 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201005256/https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/david-cameron-on-families|archive-date=1 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He stated in 2014 that there was 'no better place to start' in the Conservative mission of 'building society from the bottom up' than the family, which was responsible for individual welfare and well-being long before the welfare state came into play.<ref name=":1" /> He also argued that 'family and politics are inextricably linked'.<ref name=":1" /> Both Cameron and [[Theresa May]] have aimed at helping families achieve a work-home balance and have previously proposed to offer all parents 12 months parental leave, to be shared by parents as they choose.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/15/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Family at heart of Conservative policy, says Cameron|first1=Deborah|last1=Summers|date=15 March 2008|access-date=4 April 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301040832/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/15/davidcameron.conservatives|archive-date=1 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This policy is now in place, offering 50 weeks total parental leave, of which 37 weeks are paid leave, which can be shared between both parents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay|title=Shared Parental Leave and Pay|work=GOV.UK|access-date=30 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201005414/https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay|archive-date=1 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Other policies have included doubling the free hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 30 hours a week during term-time, although parents can reduce the number of hours per week to 22 and spread across 52 weeks of the year. However, numerous childcare providers have argued that this policy is unworkable, as it means that they do not receive enough compensation from the government to make up for the lost childcare fees, and so their businesses are no longer financially viable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/27/uk-nurseries-30-hours-free-childcare-parents-providers-think-again|title=Looking forward to those 30 hours of free nursery care?

=== Jobs and welfare policy ===
One of the Conservatives' key policy goals in 2010 was to reduce the number of people in the UK claiming state benefits, and increase the number of people in the workforce. Between 2010 and 2014, all claimants of [[Incapacity Benefit]] were moved onto a new benefit scheme, [[Employment and Support Allowance]], which was then subsumed into the [[Universal Credit]] system alongside other welfare benefits in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/incapacity-benefit|title=Incapacity Benefit|work=GOV.UK|access-date=30 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201005301/https://www.gov.uk/incapacity-benefit|archive-date=1 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/universal-credit-for-disabled-people#when-will-i-move-from-esa-onto-universal-credit|title=Universal Credit for sick and disabled people|access-date=30 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702203116/https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/universal-credit-for-disabled-people#when-will-i-move-from-esa-onto-universal-credit|archive-date=2 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Universal Credit system has come under immense scrutiny since its introduction.

Until 1999, Conservatives opposed the creation of a [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998|national minimum wage]], as they believed it would cost jobs, and businesses would be reluctant to start business in the UK from fear of high labour costs.<ref>[http://www.general-election-2010.co.uk/is-the-national-minimum-wage-safe-under-a-conservative-government-poll.html Is the National Minimum Wage Safe Under a Conservative Government Poll?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111140655/http://www.general-election-2010.co.uk/is-the-national-minimum-wage-safe-under-a-conservative-government-poll.html |date=11 January 2012 }}.

=== Energy and climate change policy ===
[[David Cameron]] brought several '[[Green conservatism|green]]' issues to the forefront of his 2010 campaign. These included proposals designed to impose a tax on workplace car parking spaces, a halt to airport growth, a tax on cars with exceptionally poor petrol mileage, and restrictions on car advertising. Many of these policies were implemented in the Coalition—including the '[[The Green Deal|Green Deal]]'.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml;jsessionid=ND2RNWDNYBJL3QFIQMGCFFOAVCBQUIV0?xml=/earth/2007/09/14/eacameron114.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=David Cameron pledges radical green shake-up |date=14 September 2007}}</ref>

=== Justice and crime policy ===
In 2010, the Conservatives campaigned with the conviction to cut the perceived bureaucracy of the modern police force and pledged greater legal protection to people convicted of defending themselves against intruders. They also supported the creation of a UK Bill of Rights to replace the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], but this was vetoed by their coalition partners the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Some Conservatives, particularly within the socially conservative [[Cornerstone Group]], support the re-introduction of the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty]].

=== European Union policy ===
No subject has proved more divisive in the Conservative Party in recent history than the role of the United Kingdom within the European Union. Though the principal architect of the UK's entry into the [[European Communities]] (which became the European Union) was Conservative Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], and both [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harold Macmillan]] favoured some form of European union, the bulk of contemporary Conservative opinion is opposed to closer economic and particularly political union with the EU. This is a noticeable shift in British politics, as in the 1960s and 1970s the Conservatives were more pro-Europe than the Labour Party: for example, in the 1971 House of Commons vote on whether the UK should join the European Economic Community, only 39 of the then 330 Conservative MPs were opposed to membership.<ref name=georgiou>{{cite journal |last1=Georgiou |first1=Christakis |date=April 2017 |title=British Capitalism and European Unification, from Ottawa to the Brexit Referendum |journal=[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]] |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=90–129 |doi=10.1163/1569206X-12341511 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Anthony |author-link1=Anthony Lewis |date=29 October 1971 |title=Commons Votes, 356 to 242, for Britain's Membership in the European Market|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/29/archives/commons-votes-356-to-244-for-britains-membership-in-the-european.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=1 |access-date=14 September 2019}}</ref> Divisions on Europe came to the fore under the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1979–1990) and were cited by several ministers resigning, including [[Geoffrey Howe]], the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], whose resignation triggered [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|the challenge that ended Thatcher's leadership]]. Under Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]] (1990–1997), the slow process of integration within the EU forced party tensions to the surface. A core of [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] MPs under Major used the small Conservative majority in Parliament to oppose Government policy on the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. By doing so they undermined Major's ability to govern.

The Conservative Party has members with varying opinions of the EU, with [[pro-European]] Conservatives joining the affiliate [[Conservative Europe Group|Conservative Group for Europe]], while some Eurosceptics left the party to join the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]]. Whilst the vast majority of Conservatives in recent decades have been Eurosceptics, views among this group regarding the UK's relationship with the EU have been polarised between moderate, soft Eurosceptics who support continued British membership but oppose further harmonisation of regulations affecting business and accept participation in a [[multi-speed Europe]], and a more radical, economically libertarian faction who oppose policy initiatives from Brussels, support the rolling back of integration measures from the Maastricht Treaty onwards, and have become increasingly supportive of a complete withdrawal.<ref name=georgiou /> Under current EU practices, the degree to which a Conservative Government could implement policy change regarding the EU would depend directly on the willingness of other EU member states to agree to such policies.

In 2009 the Conservative Party actively campaigned against the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], which it believes would give away too much sovereignty to Brussels. [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow]] Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] stated that, should the treaty be in force by the time of an incoming Conservative government, he would "not let matters rest there".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7470078.stm |work=BBC News |title=Cameron's Britain: Euro-doubts |date=26 June 2008 |access-date=1 April 2010 |first=Mark |last=Mardell |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212231633/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7470078.stm |archive-date=12 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, on 14 June 2009 the shadow Business Secretary, [[Kenneth Clarke]], said in an interview to the [[BBC]] that the Conservative Party would not reopen negotiations on the Lisbon Treaty if the Irish backed it in a new referendum,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8099510.stm |work=BBC News |title= Clarke's treaty pledge sparks row |access-date=14 June 2009 |date=14 June 2009}}</ref> which they did on 2 October 2009.

The Conservative Party pledged an in-out referendum on membership of the European Union after a renegotiation. The [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum took place on 23 June 2016]], and resulted in a vote to leave the European Union – a policy commonly referred to as [[Brexit]]. Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] signed the notice under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which officially began Britain's withdrawal from the EU, on 28 March 2017, and at 12:20 on 29 March 2017, the UK ambassador Tim Barrow delivered the notice to EU president Donald Tusk, officially triggering what was intended to be a two-year process of leaving the European Union.

Following the [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|election of Boris Johnson as leader]], the Conservative Party became a strong supporter of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. On 3 September 2019 the Conservative group in the House of Commons withdrew its whip from twenty-one MPs who voted in favour of the so-called [[European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019|Benn-Burton Act]], preventing the UK to [[No-deal Brexit|leave the EU with no deal]].

In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] the Conservative Party adopted a clear pro-Brexit platform. Following the election, the [[European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020|European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act]] was passed; the United Kingdom finally withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020.

=== Union policy ===
The Conservatives staunchly support the maintenance of the United Kingdom, and oppose the independence of any of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]]: [[English independence|England]], [[Scottish independence|Scotland]], [[Welsh independence|Wales]] or [[Irish republicanism|Northern Ireland]] from it. They have had a mixed history on support for [[History of Scottish devolution|Scottish]], [[Welsh devolution|Welsh]] and [[Devolution for Northern Ireland|Northern Irish devolution]].

In 1968, [[Edward Heath]] issued his '[[Declaration of Perth|Perth declaration]]', in support of a Scottish assembly, in the wake of growing nationalism. However, the cause went unanswered during his turbulent premiership, and under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]]'s leadership, the Conservatives vehemently opposed devolution, and campaigned against it in the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997 devolution referendum]]. Following the [[Scottish Parliament]]'s establishment in 1999, they have vowed to support its continued existence, and along with Labour and the Liberal Democrats, they supported the [[Scotland Bill (2011)]], granting further devolution of power. They campaigned alongside Labour and the Liberal Democrats against full Scottish Independence in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|2014 Scottish Independence referendum]].

In Wales, the Conservatives campaigned against devolution in the [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|1997 referendum]], however likewise as with Scotland, they have vowed to maintain the [[Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament|Senedd]]'s continued existence, and in 2011 supported the further devolution of power.

In Northern Ireland, the Conservatives suspended the parliament in 1973 in the wake of the growing [[The Troubles|Troubles]], and made unsuccessful attempts to re-establish it in the same year, and in 1982. They supported the [[Belfast Agreement]] negotiated by the Blair government in 1998, and in 2009, negotiated an electoral pact with the declining [[Ulster Unionist Party]], whom it had previously been allied to before 1973 and informally during the John Major's tenure as Prime Minister. The pact was abandoned for the 2015 general election, where the [[Northern Ireland Conservatives]] ran their own candidates.

On 4 October 2016, the [[Democratic Unionist Party]]'s leader [[Arlene Foster]] and MPs held a champagne reception at the Conservative Party [[Party conference season|conference]], marking what some have described as an "informal coalition" or an "understanding" between the two parties to account for the Conservatives' narrow majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=Manley|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/10/14/news/ni-conservatives-disquiet-over-dup-love-in-to-be-raised-with-party-hq-736030/|work=[[The Irish News]]|date=14 October 2016|title=NI Conservatives' disquiet over DUP love-in to be raised with party HQ|access-date=28 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707022456/http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/10/14/news/ni-conservatives-disquiet-over-dup-love-in-to-be-raised-with-party-hq-736030/|archive-date=7 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.channel4.com/gary-gibbon-on-politics/tories-increase-majority-dup-deal/33628|title=Tories look to increase majority with DUP deal|work=[[Channel 4]]|date=4 October 2016|first=Gary|last=Gibbon|access-date=28 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018211508/http://blogs.channel4.com/gary-gibbon-on-politics/tories-increase-majority-dup-deal/33628|archive-date=18 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Since then, the DUP has generally supported Conservative legislation.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Public Whip|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/divisions.php|title=Divisions – 2015–present, Westminster|accessdate=28 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329043257/http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/divisions.php|archive-date=29 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The party opposed Labour's attempts to [[2004 Northern England devolution referendums|devolve power to the northern regions of England]] in 2004. It declared support for a commission into the [[West Lothian question]], as to whether or not only English MPs should be able to vote on issues solely affecting English matters following the Scottish Independence Referendum.

=== British constitution ===
Traditionally the Conservative Party has defended Britain's unwritten constitution and system of government. The party opposed many of [[Tony Blair]]'s reforms, such as the removal of the hereditary peers,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/216872.stm |title=Blair attacks hereditary peers |work=BBC News |date=18 November 1998 |access-date=18 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030223090951/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/216872.stm |archive-date=23 February 2003 |url-status=live }}</ref> the incorporation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] into British law, and the 2009 creation of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], a function formerly [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|carried out by the House of Lords]].

Until 2001 most members of the party were against an elected [[House of Lords]]; however opinion was later split, shown in the vote on the [[House of Lords Reform Bill 2012]], when 80 backbenchers voted for an 80% elected upper chamber, and 110 did not.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

There was also a split on whether to introduce a British Bill of Rights that would replace the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]; David Cameron expressed support, but Ken Clarke described it as "xenophobic and legal nonsense".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5120894.stm |title= Clarke slams Cameron rights plan |work=BBC News |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref>

== Organisation ==

=== Party structure ===
[[File:Conservative Party conference 2011.jpg|thumb|right|The [[National Conservative Convention]] is held during the [[Conservative Party (UK) Conference|Conservative Party Conference]].]]
The Conservative Party comprises the voluntary party, parliamentary party (sometimes called the political party) and the professional party.

Members of the public join the party by becoming part of a local constituency [[Conservative Association]].<ref name="Central-Office-v-Burrell">{{cite BAILII |litigants= Conservative and Unionist Central Office v. James Robert Samuel Burrell (HM Inspector of Taxes) |court= EWCA |division= Civ |year=1981 |num=2|date=10 December 1981}}</ref> The country is also divided into regions, with each region containing a number of areas, both having a similar structure to constituency associations. The [[National Conservative Convention]] sets the voluntary party's direction. It is composed of all association chairs, officers from areas and regions, and 42 representatives and the Conservative Women's Organisation.<ref name=organisation>{{cite web |url=https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation |publisher=Conservative Party |title=Party Structure and Organisation |accessdate=16 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005230159/https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation |archive-date=5 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Convention meets twice a year. Its Annual General Meeting is usually held at Spring Forum, with another meeting usually held at the [[Conservative Party (UK) Conference|Conservative Party Conference]]. In the organisation of the Conservative Party, constituency associations dominate selection of local candidates, and some associations have organised [[open primary|open]] [[Conservative Party (UK) parliamentary primaries|parliamentary primaries]].

The [[1922 Committee]] consists of [[backbench]] MPs, meeting weekly while parliament is sitting. Frontbench MPs have an open invitation to attend. The 1922 Committee plays a crucial role in the selection of party leaders. All Conservative MPs are members of the 1922 Committee by default. There are 20 executive members of the Committee, agreed by consensus among backbench MPs.

The [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters]] (CCHQ) is effectively head of the Professional Party and leads [[Political funding in the United Kingdom|financing]], organisation of elections and drafting of policy.

The [[Conservative Party Board]] is the party's ultimate [[decision making]] body, responsible for all operational matters (including fundraising, membership and candidates) and is made up of representatives from each (voluntary, political and professional) section of the Party.<ref name=organisation/> The Party Board meets about once a month and works closely with CCHQ, elected representatives and the voluntary membership mainly through a number of management sub-committees (such as membership, candidates and conferences).

=== Young Conservatives ===
{{Main|Young Conservatives (UK)}}
From 1998–2015, the Conservative Party maintained a [[youth wing]] for members under 30 called [[Conservative Future]], with branches at both universities and at parliamentary constituency level. By 2006, the group had become the largest political organisation on British university campuses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3655712/Forget-Tory-Boy-Conservatives-are-now-cool.html|title=Forget Tory Boy, Conservatives are now cool|journal=The Daily Telegraph|last=Gordon|first=Bryony|date=3 October 2006|access-date=19 March 2018|issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320224932/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3655712/Forget-Tory-Boy-Conservatives-are-now-cool.html|archive-date=20 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The organisation was closed in 2015 after allegations that bullying by [[Mark Clarke (politician)|Mark Clarke]] had caused the suicide of Elliot Johnson, a 21-year-old party activist.

===Conferences===
The major annual party events are the Spring Forum and the [[Conservative Party (UK) Conference|Conservative Party Conference]], which takes place in Autumn in alternately Manchester or Birmingham. This is when the [[National Conservative Convention]] holds meetings.

=== Funding ===
In the first decade of the 21st century, half the party's funding came from a cluster of just fifty "donor groups", and a third of it from only fifteen.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Crone, Stephen |author2=Wilks-Heeg, Stuart |date=20 December 2010 |title=Just 50 'donor groups' have supplied over half of the Conservative party's declared donation income in the last decade, a fact disguised by legal 'fame avoidance' techniques |url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/archives/6272 |publisher=[[London School of Economics|British Politics and Policy blog at LSE]] |accessdate=10 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712033806/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/archives/6272 |archivedate=12 July 2013 }}</ref> In the year after the 2010 general election, half the Tories' funding came from the financial sector.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Syal, Rajeev |author2=Treanor, Jill |author3=Mathiason, Nick |date=30 September 2011 |title=City's influence over Conservatives laid bare by research into donations |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/30/city-conservatives-donations |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=10 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925193837/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/30/city-conservatives-donations |archive-date=25 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

For 2013, the Conservative Party had an income of £25.4&nbsp;million, of which £749,000 came from membership subscriptions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28542408|title=Labour was best-funded UK political party in 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 July 2014|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424043844/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28542408|archive-date=24 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2015, according to accounts filed with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]], the party had an income of about £41.8&nbsp;million and expenditures of about £41&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/political-parties-campaigning-and-donations/political-parties-annual-accounts/details-of-accounts |title=Details of party accounts since 2002 |accessdate=15 July 2017 |publisher=Electoral Commission |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430091934/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/political-parties-campaigning-and-donations/political-parties-annual-accounts/details-of-accounts |archive-date=30 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== International organisations ===
The Conservative Party is affiliated to—and plays a leading part in—a number of international organisations.  As a global level, the Conservatives are a member of the [[International Democrat Union]], which unites right-of-centre parties, including the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], the U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], the Indian [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], and the South Korean [[United Future Party]].

At a European level, the Conservatives are members of the [[European Conservatives and Reformists Party]] (ECR Party), which unites centre-right parties in opposition to a federal [[European Union]], through which the Conservatives have ties to the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and the governing parties of Israel and Turkey, [[Likud]] and the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] respectively. In the European Parliament, the Conservative Party's MEPs sit in the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] Group (ECR Group), which is affiliated to the ACRE.  Party leader David Cameron pushed the foundation of the ECR, which was launched in 2009, along with the Czech [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] and the Polish [[Law and Justice]], before which the Conservative Party's MEPs sat in the [[European Democrats]], which had become a subgroup of the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party]] in the 1990s.  Since the [[2014 European Parliament election|2014 European election]], the ECR Group has been the third-largest group, with the largest members being the Conservatives (nineteen MEPs), Law and Justice (eighteen MEPs), the [[Liberal Conservative Reformers]] (five MEPs), and the [[Danish People's Party]] and [[New Flemish Alliance]] (four MEPs each).

As of June 2009, Cameron required a further four partners apart from the Polish and Czech supports to qualify for official [[Political groups of the European Parliament|fraction]] status in the parliament; the rules state that a caucus needs at least 25 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from at least seven of the 27 [[EU member states]].<ref name="guardian_03062009">{{cite news|last=Traynor|first=Ian|title=Anti-gay, climate change deniers: meet David Cameron's new friends|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 June 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/02/david-cameron-alliance-polish-nationalists|accessdate=2 June 2009|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906181732/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/02/david-cameron-alliance-polish-nationalists|archive-date=6 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In forming the caucus, Cameron is reportedly breaking with two decades of co-operation by the UK's Conservative Party with the mainstream European Christian Democrats and conservatives in the European parliament, the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) on the grounds that it is dominated by European [[federalism|federalists]] and supporters of the [[Lisbon treaty]], which is opposed by the Tories.<ref name="guardian_03062009" /> EPP leader [[Wilfried Martens]], former [[prime minister of Belgium]], stated "Cameron's campaign has been to take his party back to the centre in every policy area with one major exception: Europe.

=== Logo ===
[[File:Conservative Party Conference 2011 (6216799563).jpg|thumb|right|The Conservatives' "oak tree" logo in [[Union Jack]] colours at the 2011 party conference.]]
When Sir Christopher Lawson was appointed as a marketing director at Conservative Central Office in 1981, he was surprised find to that, apart from a few diverse symbols, there was no [[logo]] to represent the party. He developed a design based on the [[Olympic flame]] in the colours of the [[Union Jack]],<ref name ="Bruce1992">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Brendan |date=1992 |title=Images of Power: How the Image Makers Shape Our Leaders |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXiGAAAAMAAJ |location=London |publisher=Kogan Page Ltd |page=120 |isbn=978-0749406691 }}</ref> which was intended to represent leadership, striving to win, dedication, and a sense of community.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ranney |first=Austin |author-link= |title=Britain at the polls, 1983: a study of the general election |year=1985 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekqIAAAAMAAJ |location=Durham, North Carolina |publisher=Duke University Press |page=43 |isbn=978-0822306191}}</ref> Despite opposition from some traditionalists in the party, the emblem was adopted for the 1983 general election.<ref name ="Bruce1992"/> In 1989, the party's director of communications, Brendan Bruce, decided to conduct some [[market research]] into the public reaction to the logo. The results were that recognition of the symbol was low and that people found it old fashioned and uninspiring. It was decided to redesign the existing logo, rather than adopt an entirely new one which might be interpreted as signalling a change of the party's ethos. Using a design company headed by [[Michael Peters (designer)|Michael Peters]], an image of a hand carrying a torch was developed, which referenced the [[Statue of Liberty]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rosenbaum  |first=Martin |date=1996 |title=From Soapbox to Soundbite: Party Political Campaigning in Britain since 1945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyO_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA203 |location=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=203 |isbn=9781349253111}}</ref>

In 2006, there was a rebranding exercise to emphasise the Conservatives' commitment to [[environmentalism]]; a project costing £40,000 resulted in a sketched silhouette of an [[Quercus robur|oak tree]], a national symbol, which was said to represent "strength, endurance, renewal and growth". However, there was criticism from within the party; former chairman Norman Tebbit remarked on national radio that the new green logo resembled "a bunch of [[broccoli]]". It had been intended to unveil the emblem at the party conference, but a leak to the press resulted in it being launched a week earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/5348630.stm |title=Tories show off 'scribbled' logo |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=15 September 2006 |website=news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref> A change from green to the traditional Conservative blue colour appeared in 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559765/Tory-oak-tree-logo-turns-blue.html |title=Tory Oak Tree Logo Turns Blue |last=Jones |first=George |date=8 August 2007 |website=www.telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |access-date=17 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613054715/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559765/Tory-oak-tree-logo-turns-blue.html |archive-date=13 June 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> followed by a version with the Union Jack superimposed in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fabrikbrands.com/history-of-political-party-logos/ |title=The history of political party logos and what they really mean |last=Hodgson |first=Stewart |date=17 May 2017 |website=fabrikbrands.com |publisher=Fabrik Brands |access-date=17 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330154804/http://fabrikbrands.com/history-of-political-party-logos/ |archive-date=30 March 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> An alternative version featuring the colours of the [[rainbow flag (LGBT)|Rainbow flag]] was unveiled for an [[LGBT]] event at the 2009 conference in Manchester.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/aug/28/tories-gay-rainbow-logo |title=Tories seek to win gay vote with new rainbow logo |last=Mulholland |first=Hélène |date=28 August 2009 |website=www.theguardian.com |publisher=Guardian News & Media Limited |access-date=17 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907031028/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/aug/28/tories-gay-rainbow-logo |archive-date=7 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Traditionalist Conservatives ===
This [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] right-wing grouping is currently associated with the [[Cornerstone Group]] (or Faith, Flag and Family), and is the oldest tradition within the Conservative Party, closely associated with [[High Toryism]]. The name stems from its support for three British social institutions (though the Church is an English institution): the [[Church of England]], the [[unitary state|unitary British state]] and the family. To this end, it emphasises the country's [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] heritage, oppose any transfer of power away from the United Kingdom—either downwards to the nations and regions or upwards to the European Union—and seek to place greater emphasis on traditional family structures to repair what it sees as a broken society in the UK. It is a strong advocate of marriage and believes the Conservative Party should back the institution with tax breaks and have opposed the alleged assaults on both traditional family structures and fatherhood.

Most oppose high levels of immigration and support the lowering of the current 24‑week abortion limit. Some members in the past have expressed support for capital punishment. Prominent MPs from this wing of the party include [[Andrew Rosindell]], [[Nadine Dorries]], [[Edward Leigh]] and [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]]—the latter two being prominent Roman Catholics, notable in a faction marked out by its support for the established Church of England. The conservative English philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] is a representative of the intellectual wing of the [[Traditional conservatism|traditionalist]] group: his writings rarely touch on economics and instead focus on conservative perspectives concerning political, social, cultural and moral issues.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

=== One-nation Conservatives ===
{{One-nation conservatism}}
[[One-nation conservatism]] was the party's dominant ideology in the 20th century until the rise of [[Thatcherism]] in the 1970s. It has included in its ranks Conservative Prime Ministers such as [[Stanley Baldwin]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Edward Heath]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Garner |first2=Richard N. |last2=Kelly |title=British political parties today |year=1998 |page=66}}</ref> One Nation Conservatives in the contemporary party include [[Malcolm Rifkind]] and [[Damian Green]]. The name itself comes from a famous phrase of [[Disraeli]]. Ideologically, One Nation Conservatism identifies itself with a broad [[liberal conservative]] stance. They are often associated with the [[Tory Reform Group]] and the [[Bow Group]].

Adherents of One-Nation Conservatism believe in social cohesion and support social institutions that maintain harmony between different interest groups, classes, and—more recently—different races or religions. These institutions have typically included the [[welfare state]], the [[BBC]], and local government. One Nation Conservatives often invoke [[Edmund Burke]] and his emphasis on [[civil society]] ("little platoons") as the foundations of society, as well as his opposition to radical politics of all types. The Red Tory theory of [[Phillip Blond]] is a strand of the One Nation school of thought. Prominent Red Tories include former Cabinet Ministers [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and [[Eric Pickles]] and [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] [[Jesse Norman]].<ref>Politics Review, April 2013</ref> There is a difference of opinion among supporters regarding the European Union. Some support it perhaps stemming from an extension of the cohesion principle to the international level, though others are strongly against the EU (such as [[Peter Tapsell (UK politician)|Peter Tapsell]]).

=== Free-market Conservatives ===
The second main grouping in the Conservative Party is the "free-market wing" of [[economic liberalism|economic liberals]] who achieved dominance after the election of Margaret Thatcher as party leader in 1975. Their goal was to reduce the role of the government in the economy and to this end, they supported cuts in direct taxation, the [[privatisation]] of [[Nationalization|nationalised]] industries and a reduction in the size and scope of the welfare state. Supporters of the "free-market wing" have been labelled as "[[Thatcherites]]". The group has disparate views of social policy: Thatcher herself was [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] and a practising [[Anglican]] but the free-market wing in the Conservative Party harbour a range of social opinions from the [[civil libertarian]] views of [[Michael Portillo]], [[Daniel Hannan]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Despite Appearances Conservatism Remains the Dominant Ideology |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/category/libertarianism/page/3/ |newspaper=[[The American Conservative]] |date=13 January 2012 |accessdate=7 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726060253/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/category/libertarianism/page/3/ |archive-date=26 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] to the [[traditional conservatism]] of former party leaders [[William Hague]] and [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. The Thatcherite wing is also associated with the concept of a "classless society".<ref>{{cite book |first=Tim |last=Bale |author-link=Tim Bale |title=The Conservative Party: From Thatcher to Cameron |year=2011 |page=145}}</ref>

Whilst a number of party members are [[pro-European]], some free-marketeers are [[Eurosceptic]], perceiving most EU regulations as interference in the free market and/or a threat to British sovereignty. EU centralisation also conflicts with the localist ideals that have grown in prominence within the party in recent years. Rare Thatcherite Europhiles included [[Leon Brittan, Baron Brittan of Spennithorne|Leon Brittan]]. Many take inspiration from Thatcher's Bruges speech in 1988, in which she declared that "we have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain only to see them reimposed at a European level". A number of free-market Conservatives have signed the [[Better Off Out]] pledge to leave the EU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.betteroffout.net/supporters/ |title=Supporters |publisher=Better Off Out |accessdate=18 June 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130620024415/http://www.betteroffout.net/supporters/ |archive-date=20 June 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Thatcherites and [[economic liberals]] in the party tend to support [[Atlanticism]], something exhibited between Margaret Thatcher and [[Ronald Reagan]].

Thatcher herself claimed philosophical inspiration from the works of Burke and [[Friedrich Hayek]] for her defence of liberal economics. Groups associated with this tradition include the [[No Turning Back (political group)|No Turning Back]] Group and [[Conservative Way Forward]], whilst Enoch Powell and [[Keith Joseph]] are usually cited as early influences in the movement.<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric J. |last=Evans |title=Thatcher and Thatcherism |url=https://archive.org/details/thatcherthatcher00evan |url-access=limited |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/thatcherthatcher00evan/page/n20 6], 72}}</ref> Some free-market supporters and [[Christian Democrats|Christian democrats]] within the party tend to advocate the [[Social Market Economy|social market economy]], which supports free markets alongside social and environmental responsibility, as well a welfare state. Keith Joseph was the first to introduce the model idea into British politics, writing the publication: ''Why Britain needs a Social Market Economy''.

=== Relationships between the factions ===
Sometimes two groupings have united to oppose the third. Both Thatcherite and Traditionalist Conservatives rebelled over Europe (and in particular Maastricht) during [[John Major]]'s premiership; and Traditionalist and One Nation MPs united to inflict Margaret Thatcher's only major defeat in Parliament, over Sunday trading.

Not all Conservative MPs can be easily placed within one of the above groupings. For example, John Major was the ostensibly "Thatcherite" candidate during the [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|1990 leadership election]], but he consistently promoted One-Nation Conservatives to the higher reaches of his cabinet during his time as Prime Minister. These included [[Kenneth Clarke]] as Chancellor of the Exchequer and [[Michael Heseltine]] as Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page2384.html |title=Mr Major's Third Cabinet |publisher=John Major |date=25 September 1992 |accessdate=18 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031080312/http://johnmajor.co.uk/page2384.html |archive-date=31 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Electoral performance and campaigns==
National campaigning within the Conservative Party is fundamentally managed by [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters#Campaigning|the CCHQ campaigning team]], which is part of its central office <ref name="conservatives.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation|title=Party Structure and Organisation|website=Conservatives.com|accessdate=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005230159/https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
However, it also delegates local responsibility to Conservative associations in the area, usually to a team of Conservative activists and volunteers <ref name="conservatives.com"/> in that area, but campaigns are still deployed from and thus managed by [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|CCHQ]]
National campaigning sometimes occurs in-house by volunteers and staff at [[CCHQ]] in [[Westminster]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/calling|title=Philip May's Calling Community|website=Conservatives.com|accessdate=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102073000/https://www.conservatives.com/calling|archive-date=2 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>
[[CCHQ]] maintains responsibility overall for campaigning in the Conservative Party, and targeting voters{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The ''Voter Communications Department'' is line-managed by the [[Conservative Director of Communications]] who upholds overall responsibility, though she has many staff supporting her, and the whole of [[CCHQ]] at election time, her department being one of the most predominant at this time, including Project Managers, Executive Assistants, Politicians, and Volunteers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w4mpjobs.org/JobDetails.aspx?jobid=52865|title=w4mp – The site for everyone working for an MP|website=W4mpjobs.org|accessdate=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621221315/http://w4mpjobs.org/JobDetails.aspx?jobid=52865|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The Conservative Party also has regional call centres and VoteSource do-it-from-home accounts.
