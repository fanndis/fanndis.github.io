'''Paul William''' "'''Bear'''" '''Bryant''' (September 11, 1913 – January 26, 1983) was an American [[college football]] player and coach. He was best known as the [[head coach]] of the [[University of Alabama]] [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|football team]]. During his 25-year tenure as Alabama's head coach, he amassed six national championships (tied for the most in modern college football history) and thirteen conference championships. Upon his retirement in 1982, he held the [[List of college football coaches with 200 wins|record for the most wins (323) as a head coach in collegiate football history]]. The [[Paul W. Bryant Museum]], Paul W. Bryant Hall, Paul W. Bryant Drive, and [[Bryant–Denny Stadium]] are all named in his honor at the University of Alabama. He was also known for his trademark black and white [[houndstooth]] [[fedora]], deep voice, casually leaning up against the goal post during pre-game warmups, and holding his rolled-up game plan while on the sidelines. Before arriving at Alabama, Bryant was head football coach at the [[Maryland Terrapins football|University of Maryland]], the [[Kentucky Wildcats football|University of Kentucky]], and [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M University]]. He is considered by many to be the greatest college football coach of all time. <ref>https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/CFB150coaches/the-150-greatest-coaches-college-football-150-year-history</ref>

==Early life==
Paul Bryant was the 11th of 12 children who were born to Wilson Monroe and Ida Kilgore Bryant in [[Cleveland County, Arkansas|Moro Bottom, Cleveland County, Arkansas]].<ref name=Barra>{{cite book|first=Allen|last=Barra|title=The Last Coach: The Life of Paul "Bear" Bryant|url=https://archive.org/details/lastcoach00alle|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company}}<!--ISBN needed--></ref>{{rp|6}} His nickname stemmed from his having agreed to wrestle a captive [[bear]] during a carnival promotion when he was 13 years old.<ref name=ESPNBio>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Bryant_Bear.html|title=Bear Bryant 'simply the best there ever was'|date=March 21, 2007|publisher=ESPN.go.com}}</ref> His mother wanted him to be a minister, but Bryant told her "Coaching is a lot like preaching".
He attended [[Fordyce High School]], where {{height|ft=6|in=1}} tall Bryant, who as an adult would eventually stand {{height|ft=6|in=4}}, began playing on the school's football team as an eighth grader. During his senior season, the team, with Bryant playing offensive line and defensive end, won the 1930 Arkansas state football championship.

==College playing career==
Bryant accepted a scholarship to play for the [[University of Alabama]] in 1931. Since he elected to leave high school before completing his diploma, Bryant had to enroll in a [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] high school to finish his education during the fall semester while he practiced with the college team. Bryant played [[End (gridiron football)|end]] for the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Crimson Tide]] and was a participant on the school's [[1934 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1934 national championship team]]. Bryant was the self-described "other end" during his playing years with the team, playing opposite the big star, [[Don Hutson]], who later became a star in the [[National Football League]] and a [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]r. Bryant himself was second team All-[[Southeastern Conference]] in 1934, and was third team all conference in both 1933 and 1935. Bryant played with a partially broken leg in a 1935 game against [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]].<ref name=ESPNBio/> Bryant pledged the [[Sigma Nu]] social fraternity, and as a senior, he married Mary Harmon, which he kept a secret since Alabama did not allow active players to be married.<ref name=ESPNBio/>

Bryant was selected in the fourth round by the <!--Brooklyn Dodgers was once the name of an NFL team as well, please do not change -->[[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] <!--Brooklyn Dodgers was once the name of an NFL team as well, please do not change --> in the [[1936 NFL Draft]], but never played professional football.

==Coaching career==

===Assistant and North Carolina Pre-Flight===
After graduating from the University of Alabama in 1936, Bryant took a coaching job under [[A. B. Hollingsworth]] at [[Union University]] in [[Jackson, Tennessee]], but he left that position when offered an assistant coaching position under [[Frank Thomas (American football)|Frank Thomas]] at the [[University of Alabama]]. Over the next four years, the team compiled a 29–5–3 record. In 1940, he left Alabama to become an assistant at [[Vanderbilt University]] under [[Henry Russell Sanders]]. During their [[1940 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|1940 season]], Bryant served as head coach of the Commodores for their 7–7 tie against [[1940 Kentucky Wildcats football team|Kentucky]] as Sanders was recovering from an [[appendectomy]].<ref name="VU1">{{cite book|last=Dunnavant|first=Keith|title=Coach: The Life of Paul "Bear" Bryant|year=2005|publisher=Macmillan|page=53|isbn=978-0-3123-4876-2}}</ref> After the [[1941 Vanderbilt Commodores football season|1941 season]], Bryant was offered the head coaching job at the [[University of Arkansas]]. However, [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor was bombed]] soon thereafter, and Bryant declined the position to join the [[United States Navy]]. In 1942 he served as an assistant coach with the [[Georgia Pre-Flight Skycrackers football|Georgia Pre-Flight Skycrackers]].<ref name="GAP-F">{{cite news|title=Bowl bid for Tide hinges on Pre-Flight tilt result|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3vU-AAAAIBAJ&dq=georgia-pre-flight%20bear-bryant&pg=5295%2C6286096|newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News|page=7|date=November 27, 1942|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}</ref>

Bryant then served off North Africa, seeing no combat action. However, his ship, the converted liner {{USAT|Uruguay}}, was rammed by an oil tanker near Bermuda and ordered to be abandoned. Bryant disobeyed the order, saving the lives of his men.<ref>[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8dv1kns/entire_text/ "USS Uruguay (built 1928; passenger liner) survey report"], HDC1668 (SAFR 23827), San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, reproduced by [[California Digital Library]], University of California.

He was later granted an honorable discharge to train recruits and coach the [[North Carolina Pre-Flight Cloudbusters football|North Carolina Navy Pre-Flight football team]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/blogs/ncm/index.php/2009/10/21/bear-bryant-in-chapel-hill/ |title=Bear Bryant in Chapel Hill |first=Jason |last=Tomberlin |date=October 21, 2009 |work=North Carolina Miscellany |publisher=UNC University Libraries |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> One of the players he coached for the Navy was the future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Otto Graham]]. While in the navy, Bryant attained the rank of [[lieutenant commander]].<ref name=Barra />{{rp|94}}

===Maryland===
[[File:Bear Bryant 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Bryant as Maryland head coach in 1945]]
In 1945, 32-year-old Bryant met [[Washington Redskins]] owner [[George Preston Marshall|George Marshall]] at a cocktail party hosted by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and mentioned that he had turned down offers to be an assistant coach at Alabama and [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] because he was intent on becoming a head coach. Marshall put him in contact with [[Curley Byrd|Harry Clifton "Curley" Byrd]], the president and former football coach of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]].<ref>{{cite book|first= Al |last= Browning|url= https://archive.org/details/irememberpaulbea00albr |url-access= registration |title= I Remember Paul "Bear" Bryant|year= 2001 | pages= [https://archive.org/details/irememberpaulbea00albr/page/100 100]–101| publisher= Cumberland House Publishing| isbn= 1-58182-159-X}}</ref>

After meeting with Byrd the next day, Bryant received the job as head coach of the [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland Terrapins]]. In his only season at Maryland, Bryant led the team to a 6–2–1 record. However, Bryant and Byrd came into conflict. In the most prominent incident, while Bryant was on vacation, Byrd brought back a player that was suspended by Bryant for not following the team rules. After [[Maryland Terrapins football: 1856–1946#Bryant's brief stint|the 1945 season]], Bryant left Maryland to take over as head coach at the [[University of Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952802-4,00.html| title= Football's Supercoach| work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date= September 29, 1980| first= B. J. |last= Phillips| accessdate= April 2, 2016}}</ref>

===Kentucky===
Bryant coached at Kentucky for eight seasons. Under Bryant, Kentucky made its first bowl appearance in [[1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team|1947]] and won its first [[Southeastern Conference]] title in 1950. The [[1950 Kentucky Wildcats football team]] finished with a school best 11–1 record and concluded the season with a victory over [[Bud Wilkinson]]'s top-ranked [[1950 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]] in the [[1951 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]]. The final AP poll was released before bowl games in that era, so Kentucky ended the regular season ranked #7. But several other contemporaneous polls, as well as the Sagarin Ratings System applied retrospectively, declared Bryant's 1950 Wildcats to be the national champions, but neither the NCAA nor College Football Data Warehouse recognizes this claim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/history/football/fbs|title=FBS Football|website=NCAA.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/nchamps_year.php|title=Recognized National Championships by Year|website=cfbdatawarehouse.com}}</ref> Bryant also led Kentucky to appearances in the [[Great Lakes Bowl]], [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], and [[Cotton Bowl Classic]]. Kentucky's final AP poll rankings under Bryant included #11 in 1949, #7 in 1950, #15 in 1951, #20 in 1952, and #16 in 1953. The 1950 season was Kentucky's highest rank until it finished #6 in the final 1977 AP Poll.

Though he led Kentucky's football program to its greatest achievement, Bryant resigned after the 1953 season because he felt that [[Adolph Rupp]]'s basketball team would always be the school's primary sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/classic/biography/s/Bryant_Bear.html|title=ESPN Classic - Bear Bryant 'simply the best there ever was'|website=www.espn.com}}</ref> Years after leaving Lexington, Bryant had a better relationship with Rupp. For instance, Bryant was Alabama's athletic director in 1969 and called Rupp to ask if he had any recommendations for Alabama's new basketball coach. Rupp recommended [[C. M. Newton]], a former backup player at Kentucky in the late 1940s. Newton went on to lead the Crimson Tide to three straight SEC titles.<ref name="class">[http://www.ukalumni.net/ukalumni/pubs/pdf/RecognizableClass.pdf Recognizable Class - Published in ''Kentucky Alumnus'']</ref>

===Texas A&M===
In 1954, Bryant accepted the head coaching job at [[Texas A&M University]]. He also served as [[athletic director]] while at Texas A&M.<ref name=ESPNBio/>

The [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Aggies]] suffered through a grueling 1–9 [[1954 Texas A&M Aggies football team|season in 1954]], which began with the infamous training camp in [[Junction, Texas]]. The "survivors" were given the name "[[Junction Boys]]". Two years later, Bryant led the [[1956 Texas A&M Aggies football team]] to the [[Southwest Conference]] championship with a 34–21 victory over the [[1956 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas Longhorns]] at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The following year, Bryant's star back [[John David Crow]] won the [[Heisman Trophy]], and the [[1957 Texas A&M Aggies football team|1957 Aggies]] were in title contention until they lost to the #20 [[1957 Rice Owls football team|Rice Owls]] in [[Houston]], amid rumors that Alabama would be going after Bryant.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Again, as at Kentucky, Bryant attempted to integrate the Texas A&M squad. "We'll be the last football team in the Southwest Conference to integrate", he was told by a Texas A&M official. "Well", Bryant replied, "then that's where we're going to finish in football."<ref name="American Legacy article">{{cite journal|last=Barra|first=Allen|date=Winter 2006 |title=Bear Bryant's Biggest Score|journal=[[American Legacy]]|url=http://www.libarts.uco.edu/history/faculty/roberson/course/1493/readings/BEAR%20BRYANT.htm|pages=58–64|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519041331/http://www.libarts.uco.edu/history/faculty/roberson/course/1493/readings/BEAR%20BRYANT.htm|archivedate=May 19, 2010}}</ref>

At the close of the 1957 season, having compiled an overall 25–14–2 record at Texas A&M, Bryant returned to Tuscaloosa to take the head coaching position, succeeding [[Jennings B. Whitworth]], as well as the athletic director job at Alabama.<ref name=ESPNBio/>

===Alabama===
[[File:PaulBearBryantMemorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial of Bryant outside of [[Legion Field]]]]
When asked why he returned to his alma mater, Bryant replied, "Mama called. And when Mama calls, you just have to come runnin'." Bryant's first spring practice back at Alabama was much like what happened at Junction. Some of Bryant's assistants thought it was even more difficult, as dozens of players quit the team. After winning a combined four games in the three years before Bryant's arrival (including Alabama's only winless season on the field in modern times), the Tide went 5–4–1 in Bryant's [[1958 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|first season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20080817/NEWS/214379002/0/living03|title=Bear's '58 team reunites, recalls Tide's turning point to success}}</ref> The next year, in [[1959 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1959]], Alabama beat [[1959 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] and appeared in the inaugural [[1959 Liberty Bowl|Liberty Bowl]], the first time the Crimson Tide had beaten Auburn or appeared in a bowl game in six years. In 1961, with quarterback [[Pat Trammell]] and football greats [[Lee Roy Jordan]] and [[Billy Neighbors]], Alabama went 11–0 and defeated [[1961 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]] 10–3 in the [[1962 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] to claim the national championship.

The next three years (1962–1964) featured [[Joe Namath]] at quarterback and were among Bryant's finest. The [[1962 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1962]] season ended with a 17–0 victory in the [[1963 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] over [[Bud Wilkinson]]'s [[1962 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]]. The [[1963 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1963 season]] ended with a 12–7 victory over [[1963 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss]] in the [[1964 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]], which was the first game between the two Southeastern Conference neighbors in almost 20 years, and only the second in 30 years. In [[1964 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1964]], the Tide won another national championship, but lost 21–17 to [[1964 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]] in the [[1965 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]], in the first nationally televised college game in color. The Tide ended up sharing the 1964 national title with [[1964 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]], as the Razorbacks won the [[1965 Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl Classic]], and had beaten [[1964 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]] in Austin. Before 1968, the AP and UPI polls gave out their championships before the bowl games. The AP ceased this practice before the 1968 season, but the UPI continued until 1973. The [[1965 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1965 Crimson Tide]] repeated as champions after defeating [[1965 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]], 39–28, in the [[1966 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]. Coming off back-to-back national championship seasons, Bryant's [[1966 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1966 Alabama team]] went undefeated in, beating a strong [[1966 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] team, 34–7, in the [[1967 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]]. However, Alabama finished third in the nation behind national co-champions [[1966 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] and [[1966 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], who had previously [[1966 Notre Dame vs. Michigan State football game|played to a 10–10 tie]] in a late regular season game. In a biography of Bryant written by Allen Barra, the author suggests that the major polling services refused to elect Alabama as national champion for a third straight year because of Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]]'s recent stand against integration<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barra|first1=Allen|title=The Last Coach: A Life of Paul "Bear" Bryant|url=https://archive.org/details/lastcoach00alle|url-access=registration}}</ref>

The [[1967 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1967 Alabama team]] was billed as another national championship contender with star quarterback [[Kenny Stabler]] returning, but they stumbled out of the gate and tied [[1967 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]], 37–37, at [[Legion Field]]. Alabama finished the year at 8–2–1, losing 20–16 in the [[1968 Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl Classic]] to [[1967 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]], coached by former Bryant player and assistant coach [[Gene Stallings]]. In [[1968 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1968]], Bryant again could not match his previous successes, as the team went 8–3, losing to the [[1968 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri]], 35–10, in the [[1968 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]].

The [[1969 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1969]] and [[1970 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1970]] teams finished 6–5 and 6–5–1 respectively. After these disappointing efforts, many began to wonder if the 57-year-old Bryant was washed up. He himself began feeling the same way and considered either retiring from coaching or leaving college football for the [[National Football League]] (NFL).

For years, Bryant was accused of racism<ref name="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331012951/http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3104&context=cq">{{cite journal|last1=Doyle|first1=Andrew|title=Bear Bryant: Symbol for an Embattled South|journal=Colby Quarterly|date=March 1996|volume=32|issue=1|pages=80, 83|url=http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3104&context=cq|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}</ref> for refusing to recruit black players, but he merely said that the prevailing social climate and the overwhelming presence of noted segregationist George Wallace, first as governor and then as a presidential candidate, did not let him do this. He finally was able to convince the administration to allow him to do so after scheduling the Tide's 1970 season opener against a strong [[1970 USC Trojans football team|USC]] team led by black fullback [[Sam Cunningham]]. Cunningham rushed for 150 yards and two touchdowns in a 42–21 victory against the overmatched Tide. After that season, Bryant was able to recruit [[Wilbur Jackson]] as Alabama's first black scholarship player, and junior-college transfer [[John Mitchell (American football coach)|John Mitchell]] became the first player for Alabama. By 1973, one-third of the team's starters were black, and Mitchell became the Tide's first black coach that season.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bear Bryant Is Dead at 69; Won a Record 323 Games|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/27/obituaries/bear-bryant-is-dead-at-69-won-a-record-323-games.html|date=January 27, 1983|first=Joseph|last=Durso|authorlink=Joe Durso|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Bryant and blacks: Both had to wait|url=http://www.al.com/alabamafootball/bear/story6.html|date=June 6, 1983|first=Hoyt|last=Harwell|work=[[The Huntsville Times]]|location=Huntsville, Alabama|accessdate=March 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213042531/http://www.al.com/alabamafootball/bear/story6.html|archivedate=February 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=The Integration of College Football Didn't Happen in One Game|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/the-integration-of-college-football-didnt-happen-in-one-game/281557/|date=November 15, 2013|first=Allen|last=Barra|authorlink=Allen Barra|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Bear Bryant 'simply the best there ever was'|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Bryant_Bear.html|first=Mike|last=Puma|work=[[SportsCentury]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.|ESPN]]|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref>

In 1971, Bryant began engineering a comeback. This included abandoning Alabama's old power offense for the relatively new [[wishbone formation]]. [[Darrell Royal]], the Texas football coach whose assistant, [[Emory Bellard]] virtually invented the wishbone, taught Bryant its basics, but Bryant developed successful variations of the wishbone that Royal had never used.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The change helped make the remainder of the decade a successful one for the Crimson Tide. The [[1971 Alabama Crimson Tide football team]] went undefeated in the regular season and rose to #2 in the AP Poll, but lost to top-ranked [[1971 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]], 38–6, in the [[1972 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]].

Bryant's [[1973 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1973 squad]] split national championships with [[1973 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], who defeated Alabama, 24–23, in the [[1973 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]]. The UPI thereafter moved its final poll until after the bowl games.

The [[1978 Alabama Crimson Tide football team]] split the national title with [[1978 USC Trojans football team|USC]] despite losing to the Trojans in September. Bryant won his sixth and final national title in [[1979 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1979]] after a 24–9 [[1980 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] victory over [[1979 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]].

Bryant coached at Alabama for 25&nbsp;years, winning six national titles (1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, and 1979) and thirteen SEC championships. Bryant's win over in-state rival [[1981 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], coached by former Bryant assistant [[Pat Dye]] on November 28, 1981 was Bryant's 315th as a head coach, which was the most of any head coach at that time. His all-time record as a coach was 323–85–17.

==Personal life and death ==
Bryant was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life, and his health began to decline in the late 1970s. He collapsed due to a cardiac episode in 1977 and decided to enter [[Drug rehabilitation|alcohol rehab]], but resumed drinking after only a few months of sobriety. Bryant experienced a mild [[stroke]] in 1980 that weakened the left side of his body and another cardiac episode in 1981 and was taking a battery of medications in his final years.

Shortly before his death, Bryant met with evangelist [[Robert Schuller]] on a plane flight and the two talked extensively about religion, which apparently made an impression on the coach, who felt considerable guilt over his mistreatment of the Junction Boys and hiding his smoking and drinking habits from his mother.

After a sixth-place SEC finish in the 1982 season that included losses to LSU and Tennessee, each for the first time since 1970, Bryant, who had turned 69 that September, announced his retirement, stating, "This is my school, my alma mater. I love it and I love my players. But in my opinion, they deserved better coaching than they have been getting from me this year." His last regular-season game was [[Bo Over the Top|a 23–22 loss]] to [[Auburn Tigers|Auburn]] and his last postseason game was a 21–15 victory in the [[1982 Liberty Bowl|Liberty Bowl]] in [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium|Memphis, Tennessee]], over the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|University of Illinois]]. After the game, Bryant was asked what he planned to do now that he was retired. He replied, "Probably croak in a week."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923340,00.html | title=Tears Fall on Alabama | publisher=Time (subscription required) | date=February 7, 1983 | accessdate=July 23, 2012 | author=Callahan, Tom}}</ref>

Four weeks after making that comment, and just one day after passing a routine medical checkup, on January 25, 1983, Bryant checked into Druid City Hospital in Tuscaloosa after experiencing chest pain. A day later, when being prepared for an electrocardiogram, he died after suffering a massive [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].

His personal physician, Dr. William Hill, said that he was amazed that Bryant had been able to coach Alabama to two national championships in what would be the last five years of his life, given the poor state of his health. First news of Bryant's death came from [[Bert Bank]] (WTBC Radio Tuscaloosa) and on the NBC Radio Network (anchored by Stan Martyn and reported by Stewart Stogel).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090116192343/http://www.techography.com/article.php?story=20080129094840822 Bear Bryant: 25 Years] ''techography.com''.

==Defamation suit==
{{see also|Bobby Dodd#Georgia Tech's withdrawal from SEC}}

In 1962, Bryant filed a libel suit against ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' for printing an article by [[Furman Bisher]] ("College Football Is Going Berserk") that charged him with encouraging his players to engage in brutality in a 1961 game against the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/satevepost-1962.pdf|title=College Football is Going Berserk|work=[[The Saturday Evening Post]] | first= Furman| last=Bisher|date=October 20, 1962|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref> Six months later, the magazine published "The Story of a College Football Fix" that charged Bryant and [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia Bulldogs]] athletic director and ex-coach [[Wally Butts]] with conspiring to fix their 1962 game together in Alabama's favor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/georgia-vs-alabama.pdf|title=The Story of a College Football Fix|work=[[The Saturday Evening Post]]| first= Frank Jr.|last=Graham |date=March 23, 1963|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref> Butts also sued Curtis Publishing Co. for [[defamation|libel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/paul-bryant|title=Paul Bryant Facts| website= yourdictionary.com| accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref> The case was decided in Butts' favor in the US District Court of Northern Georgia in August 1963, but Curtis Publishing appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. As a result of ''[[Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts]]'' 388 U.S. 130 (1967),<ref>{{ussc|Source=f|388|130|1967}}</ref> Curtis Publishing was ordered to pay $3,060,000 in damages to Butts. The case is considered a landmark case because it expanded the definition of who can be considered a "public figure" in libel cases. Bryant reached a separate out-of-court settlement on both of his cases for $300,000 against Curtis Publishing in January 1964.

==Legacy==
Many of Bryant's former players and assistant coaches went on to become head coaches at the collegiate level and in the [[National Football League]]. [[Danny Ford]] ([[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]], 1981), [[Howard Schnellenberger]] ([[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] of Florida, 1983), and [[Gene Stallings]] (Alabama, 1992), and one of the [[Junction Boys]], all won national championships as head coaches for [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] programs while [[Joey Jones (American football)|Joey Jones]], [[Mike Riley]], and [[David Cutcliffe]] are active head coaches in the NCAA. [[Charles McClendon]], [[Jerry Claiborne]], [[Sylvester Croom]], [[Jim Owens]], [[Jackie Sherrill]], [[Bill Battle]], [[Bud Moore (American football)|Bud Moore]] and [[Pat Dye]] were also notable NCAA head coaches.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/alabama-football/bear-bryants-coaching-tree/|title=Bear Bryant's coaching tree|last=Weisband|first=Brett|date=|website=Saturday Down South|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Croom was the SEC's first African-American head coach at [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]] from 2004 through 2008. NFL head coach [[Bruce Arians]] was a running backs coach under Bryant in 1981–82.<ref name=":0" />

[[Ozzie Newsome]], who played for Bryant at Alabama from 1974-1977, played professional football for the Cleveland Browns for 13 seasons (1978-1990), and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999.  Newsome was the general manager of the Cleveland Browns-[[Baltimore Ravens]] from 1996 through 2018. . Newsome was the GM of the Ravens' [[Super Bowl XXXV]] championship team in [[2000 NFL season|2000]], and their [[Super Bowl XLVII]] championship team in [[2012 NFL season|2012]].

[[Jack Pardee]], one of the Junction Boys, played linebacker in the NFL for 16 seasons with the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and [[Washington Redskins]], was a college head coach at the University of Houston, and was an NFL head coach with Chicago, Washington, and Houston.

Bryant was portrayed by [[Gary Busey]] in the 1984 film ''[[The Bear (1984 film)|The Bear]]'', by [[Sonny Shroyer]] in the 1994 film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', [[Tom Berenger]] in the 2002 film ''[[The Junction Boys (film)|The Junction Boys]]'', and [[Jon Voight]] in the 2015 film ''[[Woodlawn (film)|Woodlawn]]''.

In a 1980 interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Bryant admitted that he had been too hard on the Junction Boys and "If I were one of their players, I probably would have quit too."

==Head coaching record==
In his 38 seasons as a head coach, Bryant had 37 winning seasons and participated in a total of 29 postseason [[bowl game]]s, including 24 consecutively at Alabama. He won 15 bowl games, including eight [[Sugar Bowl]]s. Bryant still holds the records as the youngest college football head coach to win 300 games and compile 30 winning seasons.
