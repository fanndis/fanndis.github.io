A '''public service announcement''' ('''PSA''') is a message in the public interest disseminated without charge, with the objective of raising awareness of, and changing public attitudes and behavior towards, a social issue. In the UK, they are generally called '[[public information film]]s' (PIFs); in [[Hong Kong]], they are known as 'announcements in the public interest' ('APIs').
==History==
The earliest public service announcements (in the form of moving pictures) were made before and during the [[Second World War]] years in both the UK and the US.

In the UK, amateur actor [[Richard Massingham]] set up Public Relationship Films Ltd in 1938 as a specialist agency for producing short educational films for the public. In the films, he typically played a bumbling character who was slightly more stupid than average and often explained the message of the film by demonstrating the risks if it was ignored. The films covered topics such as how to cross the road, how to prevent the spread of diseases, how to swim, and how to drive without causing the road to be unsafe for other users. During the war, he was commissioned by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] to produce films for the war effort.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sff.org.au/films-container/a-warning-to-travellers/|title=A Warning to Travellers|access-date=2013-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230522/http://www.sff.org.au/films-container/a-warning-to-travellers/|archive-date=2013-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> Massingham began to produce longer films, for both private companies and the Government, after the War.

In the US, the [[Ad Council]] (initially called the War Advertising Council) was set up in 1941, when America entered World War II.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/eotv.htm?entrycode=publicservic|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television|website=www.museum.tv}}</ref> It began implementing on a massive scale the idea of using advertising to influence American society on a range of fronts. Its first campaigns focused on the country's needs during World War II, such as encouraging the American public to invest their savings in [[government bond]]s.

After the war, PSAs were used to educate the public on a broader range of important issues. In the UK, they were produced for the [[Central Office of Information]] (COI), and again by private contractors, which were usually small film companies, such as Richard Taylor Cartoons. They were supplied to broadcasters free of charge for them to use whenever they wished. Their usefulness as a cost-free means to fill the gaps in fixed-duration commercial breaks left by unsold advertising airtime led to their being used regularly and extensively in the 60s, 70s, and much of the 80s, and consequently, within both the COI and broadcasting companies, they were typically known as "fillers". They are still being produced, although the vastly reduced need for broadcasters to turn to third-party filler material to deal with unused airtime during breaks or junctions means they are now only seen rarely. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Topics==
===USA===
The most common topics of PSAs are health and safety, such as the multimedia ''[[WVOX#Notable Past Programming|Emergency Preparedness & Safety Tips On Air and Online]]'' ([[talk radio]]/blog) campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsc.org/nsc_events/Nat_Safe_Month/Pages/home.aspx |title=National Safety Month |publisher=Nsc.org |accessdate=2010-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616140514/http://www.nsc.org/nsc_events/Nat_Safe_Month/Pages/home.aspx |archive-date=2014-06-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/06/21/173419.php|work=Blogcritics|title=Flavor Flav Celebrates National Safety Month|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120714025430/http://blogcritics.org/culture/article/flavor-flav-celebrates-national-safety-month/|archivedate=2012-07-14|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://tolliveretips.blogspot.com/2006/06/lisa-tolliver-show-guests-flavor-flav.html|title= Lisa Tolliver show notes|work=Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://lisatolliver.blogspot.com/2006/05/how-my-radio-shows-publications-and.html|title= Lisa Tolliver's Show Notes|work=Lisa Tolliver On Air and Online}}</ref> A typical PSA is part of a public awareness [[Advertising campaign|campaign]] to inform or educate the public about an issue such as [[obesity]] or [[Behavioral addiction|compulsive gambling]]. The range of possible topics has expanded over time.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

From time to time a [[charitable organization]] enlists the support of a celebrity for a PSA; examples include [[actress]] [[Kathryn Erbe]] telling people to [[Environmentalism|be green]] and [[Crips]] [[gang]] leader [[Stanley Williams]] speaking from prison to urge youths not to join gangs or commit crimes. Some PSAs tell people to adopt animals instead of buying them. Protecting our Earth, also known as being green, is another example of a current PSA topic.

Some television shows featuring [[very special episode]]s made PSAs after the episodes. For example, ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' talked about [[child abduction]] in one episode, so it had a PSA about child abduction. Another example is when the original ''[[Law & Order]]'' did an episode about [[drunk driving]], which had a PSA about drunk driving.

One of the earliest television public service announcements came in the form of [[Smokey Bear]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psaresearch.com/bib9830.html|title=PUBLIC SERVICE ADVERTISING|website=www.psaresearch.com|access-date=2011-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527222021/http://www.psaresearch.com/bib9830.html|archive-date=2019-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the 1980s, many American cartoon shows contained PSAs at the end of their shows. These may or may not have been relevant to the episode itself. Three of the most widely known are the closing moral segments at the end of ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'', the "Knowing is Half the Battle" epilogues in ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'', [[Jem (TV series)|Jem]], [[M.A.S.K. (TV series)|M.A.S.K.]], [[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]], and the "Sonic Says" segments from ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]''.

Some television PSAs have topics such as on not watching so much television, or not taking fictional stories literally; or about television, movie, or video game ratings. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, environmental–political issues became popular, such as the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) (season 4)|Turtle Tips]]'' or ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers|Planeteer Alert]]''. The English dub of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' also has the PSA closing segments at the end of each episode called "Sailor Says" (known as "Sailor Moon Says") in two seasons only.

===In other countries===
China's first PSAs in 1986 were about saving water and were broadcast on Guiyang television.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In [[Hong Kong]], terrestrial television networks have been required since [[National Day (PRC)|National Day]] 2004 to preface their main evening news broadcasts with a minute-long announcement in the public interest which plays the [[Chinese National Anthem]] in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] over various patriotic montages.<ref>Vickers, Edward.
