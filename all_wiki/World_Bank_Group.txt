The '''World Bank Group''' ('''WBG''') is a family of five [[international organization]]s that make [[leveraged loan]]s to [[developing countries]]. It is the largest and most well-known [[development bank]] in the world and is an observer at the [[United Nations Development Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013080255/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archive-date=October 13, 2013 |title=UNDG Members |publisher=United Nations Development Group |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref> The bank is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] in the [[United States]].

The first two are sometimes collectively referred to as the [[World Bank]].

The World Bank's (the IBRD and IDA's) activities are focused on [[Developing country|developing countries]], in fields such as human development (e.g. education, health), agriculture and rural development (e.g. irrigation and rural services), environmental protection (e.g. pollution reduction, establishing and enforcing regulations), infrastructure (e.g. roads, urban regeneration, and electricity), large industrial construction projects, and [[governance]] (e.g. anti-corruption, legal institutions development). The IBRD and IDA provide loans at preferential rates to member countries, as well as grants to the poorest countries. Loans or grants for specific projects are often linked to wider policy changes in the sector or the country's economy as a whole. For example, a loan to improve coastal environmental management may be linked to development of new environmental institutions at national and local levels and the implementation of new regulations to limit pollution.<ref>{{cite book |title=World bank - structured financial products |date=5 April 2016 |publisher=World bank |location=Washington |url=https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sites/ppp.worldbank.org/files/documents/PPPCCSA_WBGGuarantees_Final%20_%20English%20_Printed%20Oct%202016.pdf |accessdate=5 November 2018}}</ref>

The World Bank has received various criticisms over the years and was tarnished by a scandal with the bank's then President [[Paul Wolfowitz]] and his aide, Shaha Riza, in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2007/04/12/wolfowitz-may-not-survive-world-bank-scandal-involving-girlfriend-promotion-pay/ |title=Wolfowitz May Not Survive World Bank Scandal Involving Girlfriend's Promotion, Pay Hike |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=2007-04-12 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>

==History==

===Founding===
The WBG came into formal existence on 27 December [[1946]] following international ratification of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] agreements, which emerged from the [[Bretton Woods Conference|United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference]] (1–22 July 1944). It also provided the foundation of the [[Osiander Committee]] in 1951, responsible for the preparation and evaluation of the [[World Development Report]]. Commencing operations on 25 June 1946, it approved its first loan on 9 May 1947 (US$250M to France for postwar reconstruction, in real terms the largest loan issued by the Bank to date).

==Membership==

==Organizational structure==
[[File:The World Bank Group Building.jpg|thumb|The World Bank Group Building in [[Washington D.C.]]]]
[[File:The World Bank Group.jpg|thumb|The World Bank Sign on the building]]
Together with four affiliated agencies created between 1957 and 1988, the IBRD is part of the World Bank Group. The Group's headquarters are in [[Washington, D.C.]] It is an international organization owned by member governments; although it makes profits, these profits are used to support continued efforts in poverty reduction.<ref>[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTSITETOOLS/0,,contentMDK:20147466~menuPK:344189~pagePK:98400~piPK:98424~theSitePK:95474,00.html#13 FAQ-About The World Bank], Worldbank.org.</ref>

Technically the World Bank is part of the United Nations system,<ref>[http://www.colorado.edu/StudentGroups/mun/docs/unsystem.jpg The United Nations system: Principal Organs], Colorado.edu.</ref> but its governance structure is different: each institution in the World Bank Group is owned by its member governments, which subscribe to its basic share capital, with votes proportional to shareholding. Membership gives certain voting rights that are the same for all countries but there are also additional votes which depend on financial contributions to the organization. The President of the World Bank is nominated by the President of the United States and elected by the Bank's Board of Governors.<ref name=WBA/> As of 15 November 2009 the United States held 16.4% of total votes, Japan 7.9%, Germany 4.5%, the United Kingdom 4.3%, and France 4.3%. As changes to the Bank's Charter require an 85% super-majority, the US can block any major change in the Bank's governing structure.<ref>[http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/bwi-wto/wbank/2003/0626blocks.htm US Blocks Stronger African Voice At World Bank]  Retrieved 7 August 2007.</ref>

===World Bank Group agencies===
The World Bank Group consists of
* the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD), established in 1944, which provides debt financing on the basis of sovereign guarantees;
* the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), established in 1956, which provides various forms of financing without sovereign guarantees, primarily to the private sector;
* the [[International Development Association]] (IDA), established in 1960, which provides concessional financing (interest-free loans or grants), usually with sovereign guarantees;
* the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), established in 1965, which works with governments to reduce investment risk;
* the [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency]] (MIGA), established in 1988, which provides insurance against certain types of risk, including political risk, primarily to the private sector.

The term "[[World Bank]]" generally refers to just the IBRD and IDA, whereas the term "World Bank Group" or "WBG" is used to refer to all five institutions collectively.<ref name=WBA>[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/0,,contentMDK:20040580~menuPK:1696997~pagePK:51123644~piPK:329829~theSitePK:29708,00.html "About Us"], ''wordbank.org'', accessed 30 May 2007.</ref>

The [[World Bank Institute]] is the capacity development branch of the World Bank, providing learning and other capacity-building programs to member countries.

The IBRD has 189 member governments, and the other institutions have between 153 and 184 members.<ref name="WBG Member Countries"/> The institutions of the World Bank Group are all run by a Board of Governors meeting once a year.<ref name=WBA/> Each member country appoints a governor, generally its Minister of Finance. On a daily basis the World Bank Group is run by a Board of 25 Executive Directors to whom the governors have delegated certain powers. Each Director represents either one country (for the largest countries), or a group of countries. Executive Directors are appointed by their respective governments or the constituencies.<ref name=WBA/>

The agencies of the World Bank are each governed by their Articles of Agreement that serve as the legal and institutional foundation for all of their work.<ref name=WBA/>

The activities of the [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]] and [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency|MIGA]] include investment in the private sector and providing insurance respectively.

===Presidency===
Traditionally, the Bank President has always been a U.S. citizen nominated by the President of the United States, the largest shareholder in the bank. The nominee is subject to confirmation by the Executive Directors, to serve for a five-year, renewable term.<ref name=WBA/>

====Current president====
On April 5, 2019, [[David Malpass]] was selected as the 13th World Bank Group President; his term began on April 9, 2019.

===Managing Director===
Managing Director of The World Bank is responsible for organizational strategy; budget and strategic planning; information technology; shared services; Corporate Procurement; General Services and Corporate Security; the Sanctions System; and the Conflict Resolution and Internal Justice System. The present MD Shaolin Yang assumed the office after [[Sri Mulyani]] resigned from the post to take the charge as finance minister of [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/more-chinese-at-helm-of-international-organisations.|title=More Chinese at helm of international organisations|newspaper=The Straits Times|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2016/07/27/indonesia-president-appoints-world-bank-sri-mulyani-as-finance-minister/|title=Indonesia's president appoints World Bank's Sri Mulyani as finance minister |newspaper=The Star|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>

===Extractive Industries review===
After longstanding criticisms from [[civil society]] of the Bank's involvement in the oil, gas, and [[mining industry|mining]] sectors, the World Bank in July 2001 launched an independent review called the ''Extractive Industries Review'' (EIR – not to be confused with [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental Impact Report]]). The review was headed by an "Eminent Person", [[Emil Salim|Dr. Emil Salim]] (former Environment Minister of Indonesia). Dr. Salim held consultations with a wide range of stakeholders in 2002 and 2003. The EIR recommendations were published in January 2004 in a final report entitled "Striking a Better Balance".<ref name=SBB>[http://go.worldbank.org/PIW55278X0 "Striking a Better Balance"], ''worldbank.org'', January 2004, accessed 30 May 2007.</ref> The report concluded that fossil fuel and mining projects do not alleviate poverty, and recommended that World Bank involvement with these sectors be phased out by 2008 to be replaced by investment in [[renewable energy]] and [[Sustainable energy|clean energy]]. The World Bank published its Management Response to the EIR in September 2004.<ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTOGMC/Resources/finaleirmanagementresponse.pdf "Striking a Better Balance"], "World Bank Group Management Response" to "The World Bank Group and Extractive Industries: The Final Report of the Extractive Industries Review: World Bank Group Management Response",17 September 2004, accessed 30 May 2007.</ref> following extensive discussions with the Board of Directors. The Management Response did not accept many of the EIR report's conclusions. However, the EIR served to alter the World Bank's policies on oil, gas and mining in important ways, as has been documented by the World Bank in a recent follow-up report.<ref name=OGMC>[http://go.worldbank.org/BE8FH2VK40 "Oil, Gas, Mining, and Chemicals" (follow up report)], accessed 30 May 2007.</ref> One area of particular controversy concerned the rights of indigenous peoples. Critics point out that the Management Response weakened a key recommendation that indigenous peoples and affected communities should have to provide 'consent' for projects to proceed – instead, there would be 'consultation'.<ref>[http://www.newint.org/columns/currents/2004/11/01/sustainability/index.php "The Energy Tug of War"], ''[[The New Internationalist]]'', No. 373 (November 2004), accessed 30 May 2007.<!--This citation was to a vague index and not to a specific article; what source at this site? The URL given pointed to a webpage headed "Hannah Arendt" with an index of items none of which seemed to pertain.???--></ref> Following the EIR process, the World Bank issued a revised Policy on Indigenous Peoples.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080507073514/http://wbln0018.worldbank.org/Institutional/Manuals/OpManual.nsf/B52929624EB2A3538525672E00775F66/0F7D6F3F04DD70398525672C007D08ED?OpenDocument "World Bank Operational Manual: Operational Policies: Indigenous Peoples" (Op 4.10)], ''worldbank.org'', July 2005, accessed 30 May 2007.

[[World Bank#Criticisms|The World Bank has long been criticized]] by a range of non-governmental organizations and academics, notably including its former Chief Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]], who is equally critical of the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[US Treasury Department]], and US and other developed country trade negotiators.<ref name=stiglitz>See [[Joseph Stiglitz]], ''[[The Roaring Nineties]]'', ''[[Globalization and Its Discontents]]'', and ''[[Making Globalization Work]]''.<!--These sources need fuller citations, inc. places and dates of publication, page numbers as applicable, and ISBN nos.--></ref> Critics argue that the so-called [[free market]] reform policies – which the Bank advocates in many cases – in practice are often harmful to [[economic development]] if implemented badly, too quickly ("[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]"), in the wrong sequence, or in very weak, uncompetitive economies.<ref name=stiglitz /><!--"Stiglitz op. cit." was a too-vague insufficient citation; specifically in what sources by Stiglitz and on what pages do these statements come from? op. cit. is incorrect; the ref. to Stiglitz is in directly preceding note: "Ibid." used to be used; but pref. is now to cite the last name and specific book or article or chapter in book, and in a full citation.--> World Bank loan agreements can also force procurements of goods and services at uncompetitive, non free-market, prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unnayan.org/Other/IFI_Watch_Bangladesh_Vol_1%20No_1.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - IFI Watch Bangladesh_Vol_1 No_1.doc |accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref>{{Rp|5}} Other critical writers such as [[John Perkins (author)|John Perkins]], label the international financial institutions as 'illegal and illegitimate' and a cog of coercive American diplomacy in carrying out financial terrorism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Confessions of an Economic Hit Man]]|last=Perkins|first=John|year=2004|isbn=0-452-28708-1|pages=259}}</ref> 

In ''Masters of Illusion: The World Bank and the Poverty of Nations'' (1996), Catherine Caufield argues that the assumptions and structure of the World Bank operation ultimately harms developing nations rather than promoting them. In terms of assumption, Caufield first criticizes the highly homogenized and Western recipes of "development" held by the Bank. To the World Bank, different nations and regions are indistinguishable, and ready to receive the "uniform remedy of development". The danger of this assumption is that to attain even small portions of success, Western approaches to life are adopted and traditional economic structures and values are abandoned. A second assumption is that poor countries cannot modernize without money and advice from abroad.

A number of intellectuals in developing countries have argued that the World Bank is deeply implicated in contemporary modes of donor and NGO driven imperialism and that its intellectual contribution functions, primarily, to seek to blame the poor for their condition.<ref>For instance see David Moore's edited book 'The World Bank', University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2007</ref>

Defenders of the World Bank contend that no country is forced to borrow its money. The Bank provides both loans and grants. Even the loans are concessional since they are given to countries that have no access to international [[capital market]]s. Furthermore, the loans, both to poor and middle-income countries, are at below market-value [[interest rate]]s. The World Bank argues that it can help development more through loans than grants, because money repaid on the loans can then be lent for other projects.

Criticism was also expressed towards the IFC and MIGA and their way of evaluating the social and environmental impact of their projects. Critics state that even though IFC and MIGA have more of these standards than the World Bank they mostly rely on private-sector clients to monitor their implementation and miss an independent monitoring institution in this context. This is why an extensive review of the institutions' implementation strategy of social and environmental standards is demanded.<ref>{{cite web |title=Most relevant review |author=Korinna Horta |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url= http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/world-bank-reviewing-its-social-and-environmental-safeguards-and-civil-society-organisations}}</ref>

===Allegations of corruption===

[http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/integrity-vice-presidency The World Bank's Integrity Vice Presidency (INT)] is charged with investigation of internal fraud and corruption, including complaint intake, investigation and investigation reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/ORGANIZATION/ORGUNITS/EXTDOII/0,,contentMDK:22641983~menuPK:2452528~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:588921,00.html |title=Integrity Vice Presidency - The Investigative Process |publisher=Web.worldbank.org |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref>

===Investments===

The [[Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman]] (CAO) criticized a loan given to the palm oil company Dinant by the World Bank after the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état]].

Other controversial investments include loans for the [[Chixoy Hydroelectric Dam]] in Guatemala while it was under military dictatorship, and a loan to [[Goldcorp]] (then Glamis Gold) for the construction of the [[Marlin Mine]].<ref name="upside down" />
