Tiruchirappalli is one of the oldest inhabited cities in India. Its [[recorded history]] begins in the 3rd century BC, when it was under the rule of the [[Chola Kingdom|Cholas]]. The city has also been ruled by the [[Pallavas]], [[Pandyas]], [[Vijayanagar Empire]], [[Nayak Dynasty]], the [[Nawab of the Carnatic|Carnatic state]] and the [[British Raj|British]]. The most prominent historical monuments in Tiruchirappalli include the [[Tiruchirapalli Rock Fort|Rockfort]], the [[Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple|Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam]] and the [[Jambukeswarar Temple, Thiruvanaikaval|Jambukeswarar temple at Thiruvanaikaval]]. The archaeologically important town of [[Uraiyur]], capital of the [[Early Cholas]], is now a neighbourhood in Tiruchirappalli. The city played a critical role in the [[Carnatic Wars]] (1746–1763) between the [[East India Company|British]] and the [[French East India Company|French East India companies]].

The city is an important educational centre in the state of Tamil Nadu, and houses nationally recognised institutions such as [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli|National Institutes of Technology]] (NIT), [[Indian Institute of Management Tiruchirappalli|Indian Institutes of Management]] (IIM) and [[Indian Institute of Information Technology Tiruchirappalli|Indian Institutes of Information Technology]] (IIIT). Industrial units such as [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]] (BHEL), [[Golden Rock Railway Workshop]], [[Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli]] (OFT) and [[Heavy Alloy Penetrator Project]] (HAPP) have their factories in the city. The presence of a large number of energy equipment manufacturing units in and around the city has earned it the title of "Energy Equipment and Fabrication Capital of India". Tiruchirappalli is internationally known for a brand of ''[[cheroot]]'' known as the [[Trichinopoly cigar]], which was exported in large quantities to the United Kingdom during the 19th century.

A major road and railway hub in the state, the city is served by the [[Tiruchirappalli International Airport]] (TRZ) which operates flights to the [[Middle East]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

== Etymology ==
Historically, Tiruchirappalli was commonly referred to in English as "Trichinopoly".{{Sfn|Jaques|2007|p=1025}} The shortened forms "Trichy" or "Tiruchi" are used in common parlance and the full name Tiruchirapalli appears in official use by government and quasi-government departments but seldom by the native people.{{Sfn|Brayley-Hodgetts|2008|p=216}}{{Sfn|Ludden|2004|p=178}}

According to the late [[Telugu language|Telugu]] scholar [[C. P. Brown]], Tiruchirappalli might be a derivative of the word ''Chiruta-palli'' (lit. "little town").{{Sfn|Hemingway|1907|p=2}}{{Sfn|Yule|Burnell|1903|p=938}} [[Orientalists]] [[Henry Yule]] and [[Arthur Coke Burnell]] have speculated that the name may derive from a rock inscription carved in the 16th century in which Tiruchirappalli is written as ''Tiru-ssila-palli'', meaning "holy-rock-town" in Tamil.{{Sfn|Hemingway|1907|p=2}}{{Sfn|Yule|Burnell|1903|p=938}} Other scholars have suggested that the name Tiruchirappalli is a rewording of ''Tiru-chinna-palli'', meaning "holy little town".{{Sfn|Hemingway|1907|p=2}}{{Sfn|Yule|Burnell|1903|p=938}} The ''Madras Glossary'' gives the root as ''Tiruććināppalli'' or the "holy (''tiru'') village (''palli'') of the ''shina'' (''[[Cissampelos pareira]]'') plant".{{Sfn|Yule|Burnell|1903|p=938}}

According to [[Hindu mythology]], Tiruchirappalli derives its name from the three-headed demon ''Trishira'', who [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|meditated]] on the Hindu god [[Shiva]] near the present-day city to obtain favours from the god.{{Sfn|Hemingway|1907|p=2}} An alternative derivation, albeit not universally accepted,{{Sfn|Hemingway|1907|p=2}} is that the source of the city's name is the [[Sanskrit]] word "Trishirapuram"—''[[Trishira]]'', meaning "three-headed", and ''palli'' or ''puram'' meaning "city".{{Sfn|Hemingway|1907|p=2}}{{Sfn|Yule|Burnell|1903|p=938}}

==History==
{{Main|History of Tiruchirappalli}}

===Early and medieval history===
Tiruchirappalli is one of the oldest inhabited cities in [[Tamil Nadu]]; its earliest settlements date back to the second millennium BC.{{Sfn|Thani Nayagam|1957|p=324}} [[Uraiyur]], the capital of the Early Cholas for 600 years from the 3rd century BC onwards,{{Sfn|Sastri|1935|p=22}} is a neighbourhood in the present-day Tiruchirappalli.{{Sfn|Sastri|1935|p=19}}{{Sfn|Beck|2006|p=40}} The city is referred to as Orthoura by the historian [[Ptolemy]] in his 2nd-century work ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]''.{{Sfn|Caldwell|1881|p=25}} The world's oldest surviving dam, the [[Kallanai]] (Lower Anaicut) about {{convert|18|km|mi}} from Uraiyur,<ref>{{Google maps | url =https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Uraiyur,%20tiruchirappalli&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF-8&ei=SauEUoHnA4Sihged24C4DA&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg | accessdate =3 January 2014}}</ref> was built across the Kaveri River by [[Karikala Chola]] in the 2nd century AD.{{Sfn|Pujari|Kolhe|Kumar|2006|p=102}}

The medieval history of Tiruchirappalli begins with the reign of the Pallava king [[Mahendravarman I]], who ruled over South India in the 6th century AD and constructed the rock-cut cave-temples within the [[Tiruchirapalli Rock Fort|Rockfort]].{{Sfn|Kuppuram|1988|p=105}}{{Sfn|Sastri|1935|p=105}}{{Sfn|Beck|2006|pp=42–92}} Following the downfall of the Pallavas in the 8th century, the city was conquered by the [[Medieval Cholas]], who ruled until the 13th century.{{Sfn|Sastri|1935|p=438}}

[[File:Mohamed Ali Khan Walajan.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah|alt=A portrait of Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah]]

After the decline of the Cholas, Tiruchirappalli was conquered by the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyas]],{{Sfn|Aiyangar|1921|p=45}} who ruled from 1216 until their defeat in 1311 by [[Malik Kafur]], the commander of [[Allauddin Khilji]].{{Sfn|Aiyangar|1921|p=99}}{{Sfn|Lal|1967|pp=251–252}} The victorious armies of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] are believed to have plundered and ravaged the region.{{Sfn|Aiyangar|1921|p=99}}{{Sfn|Lal|1967|pp=251–252}}{{Sfn|Aiyangar|1921|pp=112–116}} The idol of the Hindu god [[Ranganatha]] in the temple of [[Srirangam]] vanished at about this time and was not recovered and reinstated for more than fifty years.{{Sfn|Lal|1967|pp=251–252}}{{Sfn|Aiyangar|1921|pp=112–116}} Tiruchirappalli was ruled by the Delhi and [[Madurai Sultanate|Madurai]] sultanates from 1311 to 1378,{{Sfn|Sastri|1935|p=213}} but by the middle of the 14th century the Madurai Sultanate had begun to fall apart.{{Sfn|Aiyangar|1921|p=185-188}} Gradually, the Vijayanagar Empire established supremacy over the northern parts of the kingdom, and Tiruchirappalli was taken by the Vijayanagar prince [[Kumara Kampana|Kumara Kampanna Udaiyar]] in 1371.{{Sfn|Sastri|1935|p=241}} The Vijayanagar Empire ruled the region from 1378 until the 1530s, and played a prominent role in reviving Hinduism by reconstructing temples and monuments destroyed by the previous Muslim rulers.{{Sfn|Yunus|Parmar|2003|p=116}} Following the collapse of the Vijayanagar Empire in the early part of the 16th century, the [[Madurai Nayaks|Madurai Nayak kingdom]] began to assert its independence.{{Sfn|Aiyangar|1921|p=169}}{{Sfn|Sewell|1900|p=49}}{{Sfn|Sathianathaier|1924|p=234}} The city flourished during the reign of [[Vishwanatha Nayak]] (c. 1529–1564), who is said to have protected the area by constructing the [[Teppakulam, Tiruchirapppalli|Teppakulam]] and building walls around the Srirangam temple.{{Sfn|Hemingway|1907|p=51}}{{Sfn|Illustrated Guide to the South Indian Railway|1926|pp=73–74}} His successor [[Kumara Krishnappa Nayak]]a made Tiruchirappalli his capital,{{Sfn|Illustrated Guide to the South Indian Railway|1926|pp=73–74}} and it served as the capital of the Madurai Nayak kingdom from 1616 to 1634 and from 1665 to 1736.{{Sfn|Sathianathaier|1924|pp=103–160}}{{Sfn|Amaladass|1988|p=122}}{{Sfn|Subrahmanian|1977|pp=12–61}}

In 1736 the last Madurai Nayak ruler, [[Meenakshi (Nayak queen)|Meenakshi]], committed suicide, and Tiruchirappalli was conquered by [[Chanda Sahib]].{{Sfn|Sathianathaier|1924|p=234}}{{Sfn|Ramaswami|1984|pp=43–79}} He ruled the kingdom from 1736 to 1741, when he was captured and imprisoned by the [[Marathas]] in the [[Siege of Trichinopoly (1741)|siege of Tiruchirappalli (1741)]] led by general [[Raghuji Bhonsle]] under the orders of [[Chhattrapati Shahu]].{{Sfn|Ramaswami|1984|pp=43–79}}{{Sfn|Jaques|2007|pp=1034–1035}}{{Sfn|Subramanian|1928|p=52–53}} Chanda Sahib remained prisoner for about eight years before making his escape from the Maratha Empire. Tiruchirappalli was administered by the Maratha general [[Murari Rao]] from 1741 to 1743, when [[Siege of Trichinopoly (1743)|it was acquired]] by the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], who bribed Rao to hand over the city.{{Sfn|Ramaswami|1984|pp=43–79}}{{Sfn|Subramanian|1928|p=52–53}} Nizam appointed Khwaja Abdullah as the ruler and returned to [[Golkonda]].{{Sfn|Chhabra|2005|p=103}} When the [[Nawab of the Carnatic]] [[Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah]] was dethroned by Chanda Sahib after the [[Battle of Ambur]] (1749), the former fled to Tiruchirappalli, where he set up his base.{{Sfn|Rose|Newton|1929|pp=126–127}}{{Sfn|Markovits|2004|p=222}}{{Sfn|Ramaswami|1984|p=115}} The subsequent [[Siege of Trichinopoly (1751-1752)|siege of Tiruchirappalli (1751–1752)]] by Chanda Sahib took place during the [[Second Carnatic War]] between the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah on one side and Chanda Sahib and the [[French East India Company]] on the other.{{Sfn|Ramaswami|1984|p=148}} The British were victorious and Wallajah was restored to the throne. During his reign he proposed renaming the city Natharnagar after the Sufi saint [[Nathar Vali]], who is thought to have lived there in the 12th century AD.{{Sfn|Bayly|2004|p=233}}{{Sfn|Muthiah|2008|p=137}} Tiruchirappalli was invaded by [[Nanjaraja Wodeyar]] in 1753 and [[Hyder Ali]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore kingdom]] in 1780, both attacks repulsed by the troops of the British East India Company.{{Sfn|Brayley-Hodgetts|2008|p=217}} A third invasion attempt, by [[Tipu Sultan]]—son of Hyder Ali—in 1793, was also unsuccessful;{{Sfn|Burn|Cotton|1908|p=29}} he was pursued by British forces led by [[William Medows]], who thwarted the attack.{{Sfn|Fortescue|1902|pp=558–559}}

===British rule===
The Carnatic kingdom was [[Carnatic Treaty|annexed by the British]] in July 1801 as a consequence of the discovery of collusion between Tipu Sultan—an enemy of the British—and [[Umdat Ul-Umra]], son of Wallajah and the [[Nawab]] at the time, during the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]].{{Sfn|Ingram|1995|pp=5–27}}{{Sfn|Ramachandran|2008|p=74}} Trichinopoly was incorporated into the [[Madras Presidency]] the same year, and the district of [[Trichinopoly District|Trichinopoly]] was formed, with the city of Trichinopoly (or Tiruchirappalli) as its capital.{{Sfn|Moore|1878|p=178}}

During the [[Company Raj]] and later the [[British Raj]], Tiruchirappalli emerged as one of the most important cities in India. According to the [[Indian census|1871 Indian census]]—the first in British India—Tiruchirappalli had a population of 76,530, making it the second largest city in the presidency after the capital of Madras (now Chennai).{{Sfn|Burn|Cotton|1908|p=43}} It was known throughout the [[British Empire]] for its unique variety of ''cheroot'', known as the [[Trichinopoly cigar]].{{Sfn|Yule|Burnell|1903|p=938}} Tiruchirappalli was the first headquarters for the newly formed [[South Indian Railway Company]] in 1874 until its relocation to [[Madras]] in the early 20th century.{{efn|Madras was renamed as Chennai in 1996.<ref>{{cite news|title=Destination Puducherry |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/09/23/stories/2006092300020100.htm |accessdate=29 December 2013 |newspaper=The Hindu |date=23 September 2006 |first=Deepa H. |last=Ramakrishnan |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001854/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/09/23/stories/2006092300020100.htm |archivedate=31 December 2013 }}</ref>}}<ref>{{cite news|first=S. |last=Muthiah |title=The railway of the Deep South |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/the-railway-of-the-deep-south/article425584.ece |accessdate=16 August 2013 |newspaper=The Hindu |date=9 May 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007133037/http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/the-railway-of-the-deep-south/article425584.ece |archivedate=7 October 2013 }}</ref>
