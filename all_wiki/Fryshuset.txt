== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Fryshuset was founded in 1984 by [[Anders Carlberg]], a well-known Swedish advocate for social justice and reconciliation. He was on the board of the [[YMCA]] of Southern Stockholm and was commissioned to find a building where YMCA could gather all its youth activities. He found an old cold storage in the outskirts of the city. It was renovated and rebuilt into a basketball hall and into music studios for young musicians. It was called Fryshuset (the Swedish word for cold storage) and soon became a meeting place for a variety of youth groups.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bl6mDwAAQBAJ&q=fryshuset+venues&pg=PA146|title=Interreligious Engagement in Urban Spaces: Social, Material and Ideological Dimensions|last=Ipgrave|first=Julia|date=2019-07-30|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-030-16796-7|language=en}}</ref> Since then, the organization has grown steadily, today there are Fryshus branches operating in eight cities around Sweden.
