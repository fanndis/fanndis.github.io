}}
The '''Federal Trade Commission''' ('''FTC''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the United States government]] whose principal mission is the enforcement of civil (non-criminal) U.S. [[antitrust law]] and the promotion of [[consumer protection]]. The FTC shares jurisdiction over federal civil antitrust enforcement in the United States with the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. It is headquartered in the [[Federal Trade Commission Building]] in [[Washington, DC]].

The FTC was established in 1914 with the passage of the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]]. Signed into law by President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who was a strong proponent of it, the Federal Trade Commission Act was a major response to [[Trust (19th century)|19th-century monopolistic trusts]]. Trusts and [[trust-busting]] were significant political concerns during the [[Progressive Era]]. Since its inception, the FTC has enforced the provisions of the [[Clayton Act]], a key [[antitrust]] statute, as well as the provisions of the [[FTC Act]], {{UnitedStatesCode|15|41}} et seq. Over time, the FTC has been delegated with the enforcement of additional business regulation statutes and has promulgated a number of regulations (codified in [[Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]). The broad statutory authority granted to the FTC provides it with more surveillance and monitoring abilities than it actually uses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2019-10-01|title=The Missing Regulatory State: Monitoring Businesses in an Age of Surveillance|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/678|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|volume=72|issue=5|pages=1563}}</ref>{{rp|571}}

Following the Supreme Court decisions against [[Standard Oil Co. v. United States|Standard Oil]] and [[United States v. American Tobacco Co.|American Tobacco]] in May 1911, the first version of a bill to establish a commission to regulate interstate trade was introduced on January 25, 1912, by Oklahoma congressman [[Dick Thompson Morgan]]. He would make the first speech on the House floor advocating its creation on February 21, 1912. Though the initial bill did not pass, the questions of trusts and antitrust dominated the 1912 election.<ref name="FTC hist">[http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/ftc-90-symposium/90thanniv_program.pdf A Brief History of the Federal Trade Commission], Federal Trade Commission, 90th Anniversary Symposium.</ref> Most political party platforms in 1912 endorsed the establishment of a federal trade commission with its regulatory powers placed in the hands of an administrative board, as an alternative to functions previously and necessarily exercised so slowly through the courts.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140301021630/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29633 Republican Party Platform of 1912], June 18, 1912; [https://web.archive.org/web/20140301022828/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29590 Democratic Party Platform of 1912], June 25, 1912; USCB.edu</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111117204056/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-progressive/ Platform of the Progressive Party], August 7, 1912; PBS.org</ref>

With the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 presidential election]] decided in favor of the Democrats and [[Woodrow Wilson]], Morgan reintroduced a slightly amended version of his bill during the April 1913 special session. The national debate culminated in Wilson's signing of the FTC Act on September 26, 1914, with additional tightening of regulations in the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] three weeks later. The new Federal Trade Commission would absorb the staff and duties of [[Bureau of Corporations]], previously established under the [[Department of Commerce and Labor]] in 1903.  The FTC could additionally challenge "unfair methods of competition" and enforce the Clayton Act's more specific prohibitions against certain price discrimination, vertical arrangements, [[interlocking directorate]]s, and stock acquisitions.<ref name="FTC hist"/>

== Bureaus ==
[[File:Scam Watch 1280x720.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=59|upright=1.1|''How to File a Complaint with the Federal Trade Commission'', from the FTC]]

===Bureau of Consumer Protection===
The Bureau of Consumer Protection's mandate is to protect consumers against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce. With the written consent of the Commission, Bureau attorneys enforce federal laws related to consumer affairs and rules promulgated by the FTC. Its functions include investigations, enforcement actions, and consumer and business education. Areas of principal concern for this bureau are: advertising and marketing, financial products and practices, [[telemarketing fraud]], privacy and identity protection, etc. The bureau also is responsible for the [[United States National Do Not Call Registry]].

Under the FTC Act, the Commission has the authority, in most cases, to bring its actions in federal court through its own attorneys. In some consumer protection matters, the FTC appears with, or supports, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].

===Bureau of Competition===
The Bureau of Competition is the division of the FTC charged with elimination and prevention of "anticompetitive" business practices. It accomplishes this through the enforcement of [[antitrust]] laws, review of proposed [[merger]]s, and investigation into other non-merger business practices that may impair competition. Such non-merger practices include horizontal restraints, involving agreements between direct competitors, and [[vertical restraints]], involving agreements among businesses at different levels in the same industry (such as suppliers and commercial buyers).

The FTC shares enforcement of antitrust laws with the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. However, while the FTC is responsible for civil enforcement of antitrust laws, the [[Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice]] has the power to bring both civil and criminal action in antitrust matters.

===Bureau of Economics===
The Bureau of Economics was established to support the Bureau of Competition and Consumer Protection by providing expert knowledge related to the economic impacts of the FTC's legislation and operation.

=== Other Bureaus ===

* The FTC maintains an Office of Technology Research and Investigation to assist it in technology-related enforcement actions.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-08-05|title=Office of Technology Research and Investigation|url=https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection/office-technology-research-investigation|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Federal Trade Commission|language=en}}</ref>

==Activities==
{{Competition law}}
The FTC investigates issues raised by reports from consumers and businesses, pre-merger notification filings, congressional inquiries, or reports in the [[mass media|media]]. These issues include, for instance, [[false advertising]] and other forms of [[fraud]]. FTC investigations may pertain to a single company or an entire industry. If the results of the investigation reveal unlawful conduct, the FTC may seek voluntary compliance by the offending business through a [[consent judgment|consent order]], file an administrative complaint, or initiate federal litigation. During the course of an regulatory activities, the FTC is authorized to collect records, but not on-site inspections.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2018-08-01|title=Regulatory Monitors: Policing Firms in the Compliance Era|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/265|journal=Faculty Scholarship}}</ref>'''{{rp|23}}'''

Traditionally an administrative complaint is heard in front of an independent administrative law judge (ALJ) with FTC staff acting as prosecutors. The case is reviewed ''de novo'' by the full FTC commission which then may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals and finally to the Supreme Court.

Under the FTC Act, the federal courts retain their traditional authority to issue [[equitable relief]], including the appointment of receivers, monitors, the imposition of asset freezes to guard against the spoliation of funds, immediate access to business premises to preserve evidence, and other relief including financial disclosures and expedited discovery. In numerous cases, the FTC employs this authority to combat serious consumer deception or fraud. Additionally, the FTC has [[rulemaking]] power to address concerns regarding industry-wide practices. Rules promulgated under this authority are known as ''Trade Rules''.

In the mid-1990s, the FTC launched the fraud sweeps concept where the agency and its federal, state, and local partners filed simultaneous legal actions against multiple telemarketing fraud targets. The first sweeps operation was ''Project Telesweep''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/franchise/tsweep01.htm |title=Business Opportunity Scam "Epidemic" |publisher=Ftc.gov |date=July 18, 1995 |access-date=August 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310140931/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/franchise/tsweep01.htm |archive-date=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in July 1995 which cracked down on 100 business opportunity scams.

In 1984,<ref name=frop>[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1998/02/frop-97.shtm FTC Announces Results of Compliance Testing of Over 300 Funeral Homes in the Second Year of the Funeral Rule Offenders Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629013621/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1998/02/frop-97.shtm |date=June 29, 2007 }}, Federal Trade Commission, February 25, 1998</ref> the FTC began to regulate the [[funeral home]] industry in order to protect consumers from deceptive practices. The FTC [[Funeral Rule]] requires funeral homes to provide all customers (and potential customers) with a General Price List (GPL), specifically outlining goods and services in the funeral industry, as defined by the FTC, and a listing of their prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/rulemaking/funeral/ |title=Federal Trade Commission Funeral Rule - 16 CFR Part 453 |publisher=Ftc.gov |date=October 24, 2008 |access-date=August 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724005703/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/rulemaking/funeral/ |archive-date=July 24, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By law, the GPL must be presented to all individuals that ask, no one is to be denied a written, retainable copy of the GPL. In 1996, the FTC instituted the Funeral Rule Offenders Program (FROP), under which "funeral homes make a voluntary payment to the U.S. Treasury or appropriate state fund for an amount less than what would likely be sought if the Commission authorized filing a lawsuit for civil penalties. In addition, the funeral homes participate in the NFDA compliance program, which includes a review of the price lists, on-site training of the staff, and follow-up testing and certification on compliance with the [[Funeral Rule]]."<ref name=frop/>

One of the Federal Trade Commission's other major focuses is [[identity theft]]. The FTC serves as a federal repository for individual consumer complaints regarding identity theft. Even though the FTC does not resolve individual complaints, it does use the aggregated information to determine where federal action might be taken. The complaint form is available online or by phone (1-877-ID-THEFT).

The FTC has been involved in the oversight of the online advertising industry and its practice of [[FTC regulation of behavioral advertising|behavioral targeting]] for some time. In 2011 the FTC proposed a "[[Do Not Track]]" mechanism to allow Internet users to [[opt-out]] of [[behavioral targeting]].

The FTC, along with the  [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and Department of Justice also empowers third-party enforcer-firms to engage in some regulatory oversight, e.g. the FTC requires other energy companies to audit offshore oil platform operators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2020-04-01|title=The New Gatekeepers: Private Firms as Public Enforcers|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/800|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=106|issue=2|pages=467}}</ref>{{rp|4}}

In 2013, the FTC issued a comprehensive revision of its [[Green guides]], which set forth standards for environmental marketing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/10/greenguides.shtm |title=FTC Issues Revised "Green Guides"  |date=October 1, 2012 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref>

==Unfair or deceptive practices affecting consumers==
[[File:EndorsementGuides 0.webm|thumb|thumbtime=2:28|upright=1.1|''Endorsement Guides'' from the FTC]]
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, {{UnitedStatesCode|15|45}} grants the FTC power to investigate and prevent deceptive trade practices. The statute declares that "unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful."<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|15|45(a)(1)}}</ref> Unfairness and deception towards consumers represent two distinct areas of FTC enforcement and authority. The FTC also has authority over unfair methods of competition between businesses.<ref name="Unfairness Policy">{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/policystmt/ad-unfair.htm |title=FTC Policy Statement on Unfairness, Dec. 17, 1980 |publisher=Ftc.gov |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref>

===Deception practices===
In a letter to the Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the FTC defined the elements of deception cases. First, "there must be a representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer."<ref name="Deception Policy">{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/policystmt/ad-decept.htm |title=FTC Policy Statement on Deception, Oct. 14, 1983 |publisher=Ftc.gov |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref> In the case of omissions, the Commission considers the implied representations understood by the consumer. A misleading omission occurs when information is not disclosed to correct reasonable consumer expectations.<ref name="Deception Policy" /> Second, the Commission examines the practice from the perspective of a reasonable consumer being targeted by the practice. Finally the representation or omission must be a material one—that is one that would have changed consumer behavior.<ref name="Deception Policy" />

====Dot Com Disclosures guide====
In its Dot Com Disclosures guide,<ref name="Dot Com Disclosures">{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-revises-online-advertising-disclosure-guidelines/130312dotcomdisclosures.pdf |title=.com Disclosures: How to Make Effective Disclosures in Digital Advertising, March 2013 |publisher=FTC |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}</ref> the FTC said that "disclosures that are required to prevent deception or to provide consumers material information about a transaction must be presented clearly and conspicuously."<ref name="Dot Com Disclosures"/> The FTC suggested a number of different factors that would help determine whether the information was "clear and conspicuous" including but not limited to: 
*the '''placement''' of the disclosure in an advertisement and its '''proximity''' to the claim it is qualifying,
*the '''prominence''' of the disclosure,
*whether items in other parts of the advertisement '''distract attention''' from the disclosure,
*whether the advertisement is so lengthy that the disclosure needs to be '''repeated''',
*whether disclosures in audio messages are presented in an adequate '''volume and cadence''' and visual disclosures appear for a sufficient '''duration''', and 
*whether the language of the disclosure is '''understandable''' to the intended audience.<ref name="Dot Com Disclosures"/>
However, the "key is the overall net impression."<ref name="Dot Com Disclosures"/>

====Cyberspace.com case====
In ''F.T.C. v. Cyberspace.com''<ref name = "Cyberspace.com">{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/453/f3d/1196/federal-trade-commission-v-cyberspacecom-llc |title=453 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir. 2006) |publisher=Openjurist.org |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref> the FTC found that sending consumers mail that appeared to be a check for $3.50 to the consumer attached to an invoice was deceptive when cashing the check constituted an agreement to pay a monthly fee for internet access. The back of the check, in fine print, disclosed the existence of this agreement to the consumer. The FTC concluded that the practice was misleading to reasonable consumers, especially since there was evidence that less than one percent of the 225,000 individuals and businesses billed for the internet service actually logged on.<ref name="Cyberspace.com"/>

====Gateway Learning case====

====Loot Boxes in Computer and Video Games as Gambling====

In November 2018 by request of US Senator [[Maggie Hassan]], the FTC decided to investigate whether paid-for [[loot box]]es, virtual items with random benefits in certain [[video game]]s, were a form of [[gambling]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/ftc-investigates-video-game-loot-boxes-kids-gambling-connection-2018-11|title=The FTC will investigate whether a multi-billion dollar business model is getting kids hooked on gambling through video games|last=Webb|first=Kevin|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techraptor.net/content/ftc-will-investigate-loot-boxes-us-senator-claims-close-link-to-gambling|title=FTC Will Investigate Loot Boxes, US Senator Claims "Close Link" To Gambling|date=2018-11-28|website=Gaming News, Reviews, and Articles - TechRaptor.net|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ftc-agrees-investigate-loot-boxes,38165.html|title=The FTC Finally Agreed to Investigate Loot Boxes|date=2018-11-28|website=Tom's Hardware|language=en|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/loot-boxes-gambling-video-games-ftc-look-it-n941256|title=Video game 'loot boxes' net big money — and some say create child gamblers|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>

==== Money Now Funding / Cash4Businesses case ====
In September 2013, a federal court closed an elusive business opportunity scheme on the request of the FTC, namely "Money Now Funding"/"Cash4Businesses".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/09/ftc-halts-elusive-business-opportunity-scheme|title=FTC Halts Elusive Business Opportunity Scheme|date=2013-09-26|website=Federal Trade Commission|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref> The FTC alleged that the defendants misrepresented potential earnings, violated the National Do Not Call Register, and violated the FTC's Business Opportunity Rule in preventing a fair consumer evaluation of the business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/130926rosemarketingpi-hobbs.pdf|title=Case 2:13-cv-01583-ROS Document 95 Filed 09/13/13|website=FTC}}</ref> This was one of the first definitive actions taken by any regulator against a company engaging in transaction laundering, where almost US$6 million were processed illicitly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/what-is-transaction-laundering-and-what-is-the-industry-doing-about-it/|title=What is transaction laundering and what is the Industry doing about it?|date=2018-03-15|website=Payments Cards & Mobile|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://evercompliant.com/ftc-targets-transaction-laundering-in-landmark-lawsuit/|title=FTC Targets Transaction Laundering In Landmark Lawsuit|date=2017-09-13|website=EverCompliant|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>

==== OMICS Publishing Group case ====
In 2016, the FTC launched action against the [[OMICS Publishing Group]] — "OMICS Group Inc., a Nevada corporation, also doing business as OMICS Publishing Group, iMEDPub LLC, a Delaware corporation, Conference Series LLC, a Delaware corporation, and Srinubabu Gedela"<ref name="OMICS-Group">{{cite web |title=OMICS Group Inc. |url=https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/152-3113/federal-trade-commission-v-omics-group-inc |website=Federal Trade Commission |accessdate=15 January 2019 |date=1 May 2018}}</ref> — for producing [[predatory journals]]<ref>{{cite news|title = FTC sues OMICS group: Are predatory publishers' days numbered?|url = https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/02/predatory-publishers/|newspaper = STAT News|date = September 2, 2016|accessdate = October 22, 2016}}</ref> and organising [[predatory conferences]].

===Unfair practices===
Courts have identified three main factors that must be considered in consumer unfairness cases: (1) whether the practice injures consumers; (2) whether the practice violates established public policy; and (3) whether it is unethical or unscrupulous.<ref name="Unfairness Policy"/>

===FTC activities in the healthcare industry===
In addition to prospective analysis of the effects of mergers and acquisitions, the FTC has recently resorted to retrospective analysis and monitoring of consolidated hospitals.<ref name="DHG">{{cite web|url=http://www.dhgllp.com/res_pubs/hospital-mergers-and-acquisitions.pdf|publisher=DHG Healthcare|title=What hospital executives should be considering in mergers and acquisitions|access-date=November 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124010441/http://www2.dhgllp.com/res_pubs/hospital-mergers-and-acquisitions.pdf|archive-date=January 24, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Thus, it also uses retroactive data to demonstrate that some hospital mergers and acquisitions are hurting consumers, particularly in terms of higher prices.<ref name=DHG /> Here are some recent examples of the FTC's success in blocking or unwinding of hospital consolidations or affiliations:
# Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital and Palmyra Medical Center in Georgia. In 2011, the FTC successfully challenged in court the $195 million acquisition of Palmyra Medical Center by Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital.<ref name=DHG /><ref name="Phoebe">{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/111-0067/phoebe-putney-health-system-inc-phoebe-putney-memorial |publisher=Federal Trade Commission|title= In the Matter of Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc., Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, Inc., Phoebe North, Inc., HCA Inc., Palmyra Park Hospital, Inc., and Hospital Authority of Albany-Dougherty County|accessdate= November 16, 2014}}</ref> The FTC alleged that the transaction would create a monopoly as it would "reduce competition significantly and allow the combined Phoebe/Palmyra to raise prices for general acute-care hospital services charged to commercial health plans, substantially harming patients and local employers and employees".<ref name=Phoebe /> The Supreme Court on February 19, 2013 ruled in favor of the FTC.<ref name=Phoebe />
# ProMedica health system and St. Luke's hospital in Ohio. Similarly, court attempts by ProMedica health system in Ohio to overturn an order by the FTC to the company to unwind its 2010 acquisition of St. Luke's hospital were unsuccessful.<ref name=DHG /><ref name="ProMedica">{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/01/administrative-law-judge-upholds-ftcs-complaint-against-ohio|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|title= Administrative Law Judge Upholds FTC's Complaint Against Ohio Hospital Deal, Orders ProMedica to Divest St. Luke's Hospital|accessdate= November 16, 2014}}</ref> The FTC claimed that the acquisition would hurt consumers through higher premiums because insurance companies would be required to pay more.<ref name=ProMedica /> In December 2011, an administrative judge upheld the FTC's decision noting that the behavior of ProMedica health system and St. Luke's was indeed anticompetitive and ordered ProMedica to divest St. Luke's to a buyer that would be approved by the FTC within 180 days of the date of the order.<ref name=DHG /><ref name=ProMedica />
# OSF healthcare system and Rockford Health System in Illinois. In November 2011, the FTC filed a lawsuit alleging that the proposed acquisition of Rockford by OSF would drive up prices for general acute-care inpatient services as OSF would face only one competitor (SwedishAmerican health system) in the Rockford area and would have a market share of 64%.<ref name="OSF">{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/04/osf-healthcare-system-abandons-plan-buy-rockford-light-ftc |title=OSF Healthcare System Abandons Plans to Buy Rockford in Light of FTC Lawsuit; FTC Dismisses its Complaint Seeking to Block the Transaction|website=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate= November 16, 2014}}</ref> Later in 2012, OSF announced that it had abandoned its plans to acquire Rockford Health System.<ref name=OSF />
