'''Templin''' is a small town in the [[Uckermark (district)|Uckermark district]] of [[Brandenburg]], [[Germany]]. Though it has a population of only 17,127 (2006), it is with 377.01 km2 (145.56 sq mi) the second largest town in Brandenburg (after [[Wittstock]]) and the seventh largest town in Germany by area. The town is located in the south of the rural [[Uckermark]] region and its capital [[Prenzlau]], north of the [[Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve]]. The municipality comprises the villages of Ahrensdorf, Bebersee, Beutel, Densow, Gandenitz, Gollin, Gross Dölln, Gross Väter, Grunewald, Hammelspring, Herzfelde, Hindenburg, Klosterwalde, Petznick, Röddelin, Storkow and Vietmannsdorf.

==History==

The town was first mentioned in a 1270 deed issued by Henry of Ostheeren, [[Bishopric of Brandenburg|Bishop of Brandenburg]]. Then a possession of the [[House of Ascania|Ascanian]] margraves of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], it appeared as a [[German town law|town]] in 1314 under Margrave [[Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal|Waldemar]], who in 1317 concluded the [[Treaty of Templin]] here, ending the war against [[Denmark]], [[Mecklenburg]] and the [[Duchy of Pomerania]]. Heavily devastated by [[Denmark–Norway|Danish]] troops in the [[Thirty Years' War]], Templin from 1816 on belonged to the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[province of Brandenburg]] near the border with [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Mecklenburg-Strelitz]].

From 1912 on, Templin was the seat of the Electoral Brandenburgian boarding school (''[[Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium]]'') established in 1601 by Elector [[Joachim III Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim III Frederick of Hohenzollern]] at nearby [[Joachimsthal, Brandenburg|Joachimsthal]]. The school was finally dissolved in 1953. Today, Templin has a modern grammar school built in 1997.

Templin's city walls are small, but complete. There are 3 main gate towers and several modern entrances, where parts of the wall were torn down. The main [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church is the St.-Maria-Magdalenen-Kirche. The town has many [[East Germany|eastern era]] ''[[Plattenbau]]'' houses (highrise apartments) and smaller neighborhoods.

The [[Lehmann-Garten]], a [[botanical garden]] was recreated in 1988 in the park of the former ''Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium''.

[[Hermann Göring]] from 1933 on had his country residence ''[[Carinhall]]'' erected in the forest south of Gollin. The building designed by [[Werner March]] was destroyed by [[Luftwaffe]] personnel in April 1945, just days before the [[Red Army]] reached the area.

North of Groß Dölln is an [[Airport|airfield]] built in the 1950s as a military airbase of the 16th Air Army of the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet Forces]]

Templin has recently built a spa and mainly relies on tourism. It is a popular destination for day-trippers from [[Berlin]] to enjoy the many glacial lakes and extended forests. There is no discothèque in Templin, the closest is in [[Milmersdorf]]. The town square with the old town hall building is surrounded by an active downtown. There are many shops and restaurants in the area and an outdoor market every week. Many neighbouring municipalities like Milmersdorf and several other villages rely on Templin for many services.

There is an old [[powder tower]] in the town wall known as the ''[[Pulverturm, Templin|Pulverturm]]''.
