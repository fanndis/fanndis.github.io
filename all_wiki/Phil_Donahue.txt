'''Phillip John Donahue''' (born December 21, 1935) is an American media personality, writer, film producer and the creator and host of ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]''. The television program, later known as ''Donahue'', was the first talk show format that included audience participation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20141323,00.html|title=Donahue's Last Hurrah : People.com|work=people.com|access-date=September 20, 2016}}</ref> The show had a 29-year run on national television in America that began in [[Dayton, Ohio]] in 1967 and ended in New York City in 1996.

His shows have often focused on issues that divide [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] in the United States, such as [[abortion]], [[consumer protection]], [[civil rights]] and [[war]] issues. His most frequent guest was [[Ralph Nader]], for whom Donahue campaigned in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]].<ref name = times /> Donahue also briefly hosted a talk show on [[MSNBC]] from July 2002 to March 2003.

== Career ==
===Early career===
Donahue began his career in 1957 as a production assistant at [[WTAM|KYW radio]] and [[WKYC-TV|television]] when that station was in Cleveland. He got a chance to become an announcer one day when the regular announcer failed to show up. After a brief stint as a bank check sorter in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], he became program director for [[WABJ]] radio in [[Adrian, Michigan]], soon after graduating.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/phil-donahue|title=PHIL DONAHUE|publisher= Archive of American Television|access-date= February 24, 2014}}</ref> He moved on to become a [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' and later, an anchor of the morning newscast at [[WHIO-TV]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], where his interviews with [[Jimmy Hoffa]] and [[Billie Sol Estes]] were picked up nationally. While in Dayton, Donahue also hosted ''Conversation Piece'', a phone-in afternoon talk show from 1963 to 1967 on [[WHIO (AM)|WHIO radio]]. In Dayton, Donahue interviewed presidential candidate [[John F.

{{main|The Phil Donahue Show}}
[[File:Phil Donahue Johnny Carson 1970.JPG|thumb|Donahue (right) with guest [[Johnny Carson]] in August 1970]]
On November 6, 1967, Donahue left WHIO, moving his talk program to television with ''The Phil Donahue Show'' on WLWD (now [[WDTN]]), also in Dayton. Initially, the program was shown only on other stations owned by the [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] (which would later take the name of its parent [[Avco|Avco Company]]), which also owned WLWD. But, in January 1970, ''The Phil Donahue Show'' entered nationwide [[Television syndication|syndication]]. Donahue's syndicated show moved from Dayton, Ohio, to Chicago in 1974; then in 1984, he moved the show to New York City, where the show was shot at a studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, to be near his wife [[Marlo Thomas]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In 1988, from the [[Rainbow Room]], he presented a special honoring [[Mary Martin]], with [[Steve Leeds]] and the [[Rainbow Room]] Orchestra, with guest vocalists [[Michael Feinstein]], and [[Nancy Wilson (rock musician)|Nancy Wilson]]. Bandleader Leeds sang the final number "Isn't it Romantic."<ref name="Hard to find">{{cite web  | last = Staff Writer  | title = Rare and hard to Find Titles  | work = Phil Donahue Show, The (1970) TV series 1970–1996  | publisher = tvrepeater.com

After a 29-year run—26 years in syndication—and nearly 7,000 one-hour daily shows, the final original episode of ''Donahue'' aired on September 13, 1996, culminating what as of 2015 remains the longest continuous run of any syndicated talk show in U.S. television history.<!--''Donahue'' will continue to remain the longest continuously running syndicated talk show until at least 2015, if or when ''[[Live! with Kelly and Michael]]'' completes its 27th season in national syndication. If ''Live'' does not complete a 27th season, ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'' and ''[[Jerry Springer (TV series)|Jerry Springer]]'' would both pass in 2018, having both been on the air since 1991.-->{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

While hosting his own program, Donahue also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' as a contributor, from 1979 until 1988.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

=== U.S.–Soviet Space Bridge ===
In the 1980s, during the [[Cold War]] period of [[Glasnost|openness by the USSR]], Donahue and Soviet journalist [[Vladimir Pozner Jr.|Vladimir Posner]] co-hosted a series of televised discussions, known as the [[U.S.–Soviet Space Bridge]], among everyday citizens of the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States.<ref>[http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/12/06/phil_donahue_we_reached_out_instead_of_lashed_out_20867.html Phil Donahue: "We reached out instead of lashed out"] Russia, Beyond the Headlines, http://rbth.ru, December 6, 2012.</ref> It was the first event of its kind in broadcasting history: Donahue hosted an audience in an American city while Posner hosted an audience in a Soviet city, all on one television program. Members of both audiences asked each other questions about both nations. While the governments of both nations were preparing for nuclear war, Donahue said: "We reached out instead of lashed out." From 1991 to 1994 Donahue and Posner co-hosted ''Posner/Donahue'', a weekly, issues-oriented roundtable program, which aired both on [[CNBC]] and in syndication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Phil_Donahue/189331|title=Phil Donahue &#124; Biography, Photos, Movies, TV, Credits|publisher=Hollywood.com|access-date=2010-12-11|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103043533/http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/189331/Phil_Donahue|archive-date=January 3, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

His wife Marlo Thomas created a children's version in 1988 entitled ''[[Free to Be... A Family]]'' and just as Donahue and Posner have been friends ever since, Thomas and [[Tatiana Vedeneyeva]] have also enjoyed a long and fruitful friendship.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== MSNBC program ===
{{main|Donahue (2002 talk show)}}
In July 2002, Phil Donahue returned to television after seven years of retirement to host a show called ''Donahue'' on [[MSNBC]].<ref>Sherman, Gabriel, [http://nymag.com/news/media/68717/ "Chasing Fox,"] ''New York'' magazine, October 3, 2010.</ref> On February 25, 2003, MSNBC canceled the show.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/26/business/msnbc-cancels-the-phil-donahue-talk-show.html |title=MSNBC Cancels the Phil Donahue Talk Show |last=Carter |first=Bill |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 26, 2003 |access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/phil-donahue-gets-the-ax/ |title=Phil Donahue Gets The Ax |last=Collins |first=Dan |publisher=[[CBS News]] |agency=Associated Press |date=February 25, 2003 |access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref>

Soon after the show's cancellation, an internal MSNBC memo was leaked to the press stating that Donahue should be fired because he opposed the imminent U.S. invasion of Iraq and that he would be a "difficult public face for NBC in a time of war" <ref>Poniewozik, James, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1871916,00.html "In the Obama Era, Will the Media Change Too?"] ''Time'', January 15, 2009.</ref> and that his program could be “a home for the liberal anti-war agenda”.<ref>Naureckas, Jim 
[https://fair.org/extra/msnbcs-racism-is-ok-peace-activism-is-not/ "MSNBC’s Racism Is OK, Peace Activism Is Not"] ''FAIR'', April 1, 2003.</ref> Donahue commented in 2007 that the management of MSNBC, owned at the time by [[General Electric]], a major defense contractor, required that "we have two conservative (guests) for every liberal. I was counted as two liberals."<ref>Poniewozik, James, [http://entertainment.time.com/2007/04/26/im_not_generally_in_the/ "Watching the Not-Watchdogs,"]''Time'', April 26, 2007.</ref>

Donahue has admitted he's not "a very good [[Roman Catholic]]" and he did not think it was necessary to have his first marriage [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulled]]. He has elaborated that "I will always be a Catholic. But I want my church to join the human race and finally walk away from this antisexual theology."<ref name=times>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3DF1E3DF937A25757C0A9649C8B63 Questions for Phil Donahue].
