'''''The Globe and Mail''''' is a [[Newspapers in Canada|Canadian newspaper]] printed in five cities in [[Western Canada|western]] and [[central Canada]]. With a weekly readership of 2,018,923 in 2015, it is Canada's most widely read newspaper on weekdays and Saturdays,<ref>[http://newspaperscanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2015-Daily-Newspaper-Circulation-Report-REPORT_FINAL.pdf "Circulation Report: Daily Newspapers 2015"]. ''Newspapers Canada'', June 2016.</ref> although it falls slightly behind the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' in overall weekly circulation because the ''Star'' publishes a Sunday edition while the ''Globe'' does not. ''The Globe and Mail'' is regarded by some as Canada's "[[newspaper of record]]".<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Canada: Building on the New Canadian Political Economy|last=Clement|first=Wallace|publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]]|year=1996|isbn=9780773515031|page=[https://archive.org/details/understandingcan0000unse_e3q5/page/343 343]|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingcan0000unse_e3q5/page/343}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date= 2009-01-11 |title= Globe and Mail to cut jobs |url= http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Money/Story/STIStory_324744.html |newspaper= [[Straits Times]] |location= Singapore |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090130083617/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Money/Story/STIStory_324744.html |archive-date= 2009-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rabble.ca/news/2009/06/shake-globe |title=What's behind the shake up at 'Canada's newspaper of record'? |date=June 2, 2009 |work=[[rabble.ca]]|access-date=2010-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/235427/The-Globe-and-Mail |title=Encyclopædia Britannica entry |publisher=Britannica.com |access-date=2010-06-15}}</ref>

The newspaper is owned by [[The Woodbridge Company]], based in [[Toronto]].

==History==

===Forebears===
The predecessor to ''The Globe and Mail'' was called ''[[The Globe (Toronto newspaper)|The Globe]]''; it was founded in 1844 by [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrant [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], who became a [[Fathers of Confederation|Father of Confederation]]. Brown's liberal politics led him to court the support of the [[Clear Grits]], a precursor to the modern [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. ''The Globe'' began in [[Toronto]] as a weekly party organ for Brown's [[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reform Party]], but seeing the economic gains that he could make in the newspaper business, Brown soon targeted a wide audience of liberal minded freeholders. He selected as the motto for the editorial page a quotation from [[Junius]], "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures." The quotation is carried on the [[editorial page]] to this day.

By the 1850s, ''The Globe'' had become an independent and well-regarded daily newspaper. It began distribution by railway to other cities in [[Ontario]] shortly after [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]. At the dawn of the twentieth century, ''The Globe'' added photography, a [[women's section]], and the slogan "Canada's National Newspaper", which remains on its front-page banner. It began opening bureaus and offering subscriptions across Canada.

===1936 formation and expansion===
On 23 November 1936, ''The Globe'' merged with'' [[The Mail and Empire]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url= http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7924708 |title=The Globe and Mail Inc.: Private Company Information – Businessweek|work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |year=2012|access-date=April 13, 2012}}</ref> itself formed through the 1895 merger of two conservative newspapers, ''[[The Toronto Mail]]'' and ''[[Toronto Empire]].'' (The'' Empire'' had been founded in 1887 by a rival of Brown's, [[Tory]] politician and then-Prime Minister [[Sir John A. Macdonald]].) Press reports at the time stated, "the minnow swallowed the whale" because ''The Globe''{{'}}s circulation (at 78,000) was smaller than ''The Mail and Empire''{{'}}s (118,000).
[[File:Globe and Mail staff wait for news.jpg|thumb|left|233x233px|''Globe and Mail'' staff await news of the [[D-Day]] invasion. June 6, 1944.]]

The merger was arranged by [[George McCullagh]], who fronted for mining magnate [[William Henry Wright]] and became the first publisher of ''The Globe and Mail''. McCullagh committed suicide in 1952, and the newspaper was sold to the Webster family of Montreal. As the paper lost ground to ''The Toronto Star'' in the local Toronto market, it began to expand its national circulation.

The newspaper was unionised in 1955, under the banner of the [[American Newspaper Guild]].<ref name=song>{{cite web|url=http://www.unifor87m.org/our-history|title=Our History}}</ref>

From 1937 until 1974, the newspaper was produced at the [[William H. Wright Building]] which was located at then 140 King Street West on the northeast corner of King Street and York Street, close to the homes of the ''[[Toronto Daily Star]]'' at [[Old Toronto Star Building]] at 80 King West and the Old Toronto Telegram Building at Bay and Melinda.  The building at 130 King Street West was demolished in 1974 to make way for [[First Canadian Place]], and the newspaper moved to 444 Front Street West, which had been the headquarters of the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' newspaper, built in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torontoist.com/2008/04/historicist_the/|title=Historicist: The Old Lady of Melinda Street|last=Torontoist|date=April 19, 2008}}</ref>

==="Canada's national newspaper"===

In 1965, the paper was bought by Winnipeg-based [[FP Publications]], controlled by Bryan Maheswary, which owned a chain of local Canadian newspapers. FP put a strong emphasis on the Report on Business section that was launched in 1962, thereby building the paper's reputation as the voice of Toronto's business community. FP Publications and ''The Globe and Mail'' were sold in 1980 to [[The Thomson Corporation]], a company run by the family of [[Kenneth Roy Thomson, 2nd Baron Thomson of Fleet|Kenneth Thomson]]. After the acquisition, there were few changes made in editorial or news policy. However, there was more attention paid to national and international news on the editorial, op-ed, and front pages in contrast to its previous policy of stressing Toronto and Ontario material.<ref>Walter I. Romanow and Walter C. Soderlund, "Thomson Newspapers' Acquisition of 'The Globe and Mail:' A Case Study of Content Change," ''Gazette: The International Journal for Mass Communication Studies'' (1988) 41#1 pp 5-17.</ref>

''The Globe and Mail'' has always been a morning newspaper. Since the 1980s, it has been printed in separate editions in six Canadian cities: [[Montreal]], Toronto (several editions), [[Winnipeg]] ([[Estevan, Saskatchewan]]), [[Calgary]] and [[Vancouver]].

Southern Ontario Newspaper Guild (SONG) employees took their first-ever strike vote at ''The Globe'' in 1982, also marking a new era in relations with the company. Those negotiations ended without a strike, and the Globe unit of SONG still has a strike-free record.  SONG members voted in 1994 to sever ties with the American-focused Newspaper Guild. Shortly afterwards, SONG affiliated with the [[Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada]] (CEP).<ref name=song/>

Under the editorship of [[William Thorsell]] in the 1980s and 1990s, the paper strongly endorsed the [[Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement|free trade]] policies of Progressive Conservative Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]. The paper also became an outspoken proponent of the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and the [[Charlottetown Accord]], with their editorial the day of the [[1995 Quebec Referendum]] mostly quoting a Mulroney speech in favour of the Accord.<ref>Globe and Mail, Oct 30, A12</ref> During this period, the paper continued to favour such socially liberal policies as decriminalizing drugs (including cocaine, whose legalization was advocated most recently in a 1995 editorial) and expanding gay rights.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1995, the paper launched its website, globeandmail.com; on 9 June 2000, the site began covering breaking news with its own content and journalists in addition to the content of the print newspaper.<ref>{{cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/pages/ten-years-of-globeandmail/ |title=10 Years of globeandmail.com |work=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |date=June 17, 2010 |access-date=2011-01-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119213842/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/pages/ten-years-of-globeandmail/ |archive-date=January 19, 2011 }}</ref>

===Bell Globemedia merger (2001)===

Since the launch of the ''[[National Post]]'' as another English-language national paper in 1998, some industry analysts had proclaimed a "national newspaper war" between ''The Globe and Mail'' and the ''National Post''. Partly as a response to this threat, in 2001, ''The Globe and Mail'' was combined with broadcast assets held by [[Bell Canada]] to form the joint venture [[Bell Globemedia]].

In 2004, access to some features of globeandmail.com became restricted to paid subscribers only. The subscription service was reduced a few years later to include an electronic edition of the newspaper, access to its archives, and membership to a premium investment site.

[[File:TheGlobeAndMail2.jpg|thumb|''The Globe and Mail''{{'}}s former building at 444 Front Street, Toronto (1974–2016)|243x243px]]

On April 23, 2007, the paper introduced significant changes to its print design and also introduced a new unified navigation system to its websites.<ref>{{cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070421.wgreenspon21/BNStory/National/home |title=The next generation of The Globe |work=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |date=April 21, 2007 |access-date=2010-06-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515192200/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070421.wgreenspon21/BNStory/National/home |archive-date=May 15, 2008 }}</ref> The paper added a "lifestyle" section to the Monday-Friday editions, entitled "Globe Life", which has been described as an attempt to attract readers from the rival ''Toronto Star''. Additionally, the paper followed other North American papers by dropping detailed stock listings in print and by shrinking the printed paper to 12-inch width.

===Bell Globemedia divestment (2010)===
At the end of 2010, the Thomson family, through its holding company [[The Woodbridge Company|Woodbridge]], re-acquired direct control of ''The Globe and Mail'' with an 85-percent stake, through a complicated transaction involving most of the Ontario-based mediasphere.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/bce-ctv-deal-remakes-media-landscape/article1379835/ globeandmail.com: "BCE-CTV deal remakes media landscape"], 10 Sep 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/bell-ushers-in-new-era-with-ctv-deal/article1320795/ globeandmail.com: "Bell ushers in new era with CTV deal"], 11 Sep 2010</ref> [[Bell Canada|BCE]] continued to hold 15 percent, and would eventually own all of television broadcaster [[CTVglobemedia]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Canada |url=http://www.bce.ca/en/news/releases/corp/2010/09/10/75551.html|title=Bell to acquire 100% of Canada's No.1 media company CTV|publisher=BCE|date=September 10, 2010|access-date=2011-01-05}}</ref><ref name="globesale-2011">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/companies/article/915934--torstar-completes-first-stage-of-ctvglobemedia-sale|title=Torstar completes first stage of CTVglobemedia sale|work=Toronto Star|date=January 4, 2011|access-date=2011-01-09}}</ref>

===Redesign and relaunch 2010===

On October 1, 2010, ''The Globe and Mail'' unveiled redesigns to both its paper and online formats, dubbed "the most significant redesign in ''The Globe''{{'}}s history" by Editor-in-Chief [[John Stackhouse (The Globe and Mail)|John Stackhouse]].<ref name=EditorsNote10012010>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/community/digital-lab/a-new-globe-in-print-and-online/article1735935/ "A new Globe&nbsp;— in print and online"], Editor's Note from ''The Globe and Mail'', 10/1/2010</ref>  The paper version has a bolder, more visual presentation that features 100% full-colour pages, more graphics, slightly glossy paper stock (with the use of state-of-the-art heat-set printing presses), and emphasis on lifestyle and similar sections (an approached dubbed "Globe-lite" by one media critic).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/media/story/2010/10/01/globe-mail-redesign-print.html?ref=fh,www.northpine.com "Globe and Mail unveils bold design"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018135820/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/media/story/2010/10/01/globe-mail-redesign-print.html?ref=fh,www.northpine.com |date=October 18, 2017 }}, from cbcnews.ca, 10/1/2010</ref>  ''The Globe and Mail'' sees this redesign as a step toward the future (promoted as such by a commercial featuring a young girl on a bicycle),<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-globe-commercial-and-the-promise-of-the-future/article1736153/ "The Globe commercial and the promise of the future"], from ''The Globe and Mail'', 10/1/2010</ref> and a step towards provoking debate on national issues (the October 1 edition featured a rare front-page editorial above the ''Globe and Mail'' banner).<ref name=EditorsNote10012010/><ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/editorials/qa-the-new-globe-and-mail/article1736629/ Q&A with Editorial Board chair John Geiger] from globeandmail.com, 10/1/2010</ref>

The paper has made changes to its format and layout, such as the introduction of colour photographs, a separate tabloid book-review section, and the creation of the Review section on arts, entertainment, and culture. Although the paper is sold throughout Canada and has long called itself "Canada's National Newspaper", ''The Globe and Mail'' also serves as a Toronto metropolitan paper, publishing several special sections in its Toronto edition that are not included in the national edition. As a result, it is sometimes ridiculed for being too focused on the [[Greater Toronto Area]], part of a wider humorous portrayal of Torontonians being blind to the greater concerns of the nation. Critics{{who|date=April 2011}} sometimes refer to the paper as the "Toronto Globe and Mail" or "Toronto's National Newspaper". In an effort to gain market share in Vancouver, ''The Globe and Mail'' began publishing a distinct west-coast edition, edited independently in Vancouver, containing a three-page section of British Columbia news,{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} and during the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], which were staged in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], ''The Globe and Mail'' published a Sunday edition, marking the first time that the paper had ever published on Sunday.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/the-globes-olympic-coverage/article4306409/|title=The Globe's Olympic coverage|work=The Globe and Mail|date=February 12, 2010|access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>

===Changes since 2010===
[[File:Globe and Mail Centre.jpg|thumb|In 2016, the newspaper moved its headquarters to the [[Globe and Mail Centre]] on [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street East]].]]
In October 2012, ''The Globe and Mail'' relaunched its digital subscription offering under the marketing brand "Globe Unlimited" to include [[Paywall#"Soft" paywalls|metered access]] for some of its online content.<ref>"[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/help/globe-unlimited/globe-unlimited-press-release/article4627011/ Globe Unlimited press release]". ''The Globe and Mail''. October 22, 2012</ref>

In 2013, The Globe and Mail ended distribution of the print edition to Newfoundland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/stop-the-presses-globe-and-mail-ends-print-edition-in-maritimes-1.4256289|title=Stop the presses: Globe and Mail ends print edition in Maritimes|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|author=Jon Tattrie|date=August 21, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>

In 2014, the then-publisher [[Philip Crawley]] announced the recruitment of a former staffer returned from afar, [[David Walmsley]], as Editor-in-Chief, to be enacted 24 March.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-globe-and-mail-appoints-david-walmsley-as-editor-in-chief/article17566145/|title=The Globe and Mail appoints David Walmsley as editor-in-chief|date=March 19, 2014|via=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>

The headquarters site at 444 Front Street West was sold in 2012 to three real estate firms (RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust, and Diamond Corporation) who planned to redevelop the {{convert|6.5|acre|ha}} site at Front Street West into a retail, office and residential complex.<ref>{{cite news|title=Globe and Mail’s head office site sold to three real estate firms|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/globe-and-mails-head-office-site-sold-to-three-real-estate-firms/article5212389/|access-date=June 29, 2014|date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> In 2016, the newspaper moved to 351 King Street East, adjacent to the former [[Toronto Sun Building]]. It now occupies five of the new tower's 17 stories, and is named "The [[Globe and Mail Centre]]" under a 15-year lease.<ref>{{cite news|title=Globe and Mail to be lead tenant of new Toronto office tower|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/globe-and-mail-to-be-lead-tenant-of-new-toronto-office-tower/article14400923/|access-date=June 29, 2014|date=September 18, 2013}}</ref>

In 2015, the Woodbridge Company acquired the remaining 15% of the newspaper from BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/bce-inc-sells-15-stake-in-globe-and-mail-stake-to-thomson-family-company|title=BCE Inc sells 15% stake in Globe and Mail stake to Thomson family company|date=August 14, 2015}}</ref>

''Globe and Mail'' employees are represented by [[Unifor]], whose most recent negotiations brought in a three-year contract, which was to end in 2017.<ref>[http://business.financialpost.com/news/globe-and-mails-unionized-staff-vote-to-approve-new-collective-agreement Financialpost.com: "Globe and Mail’s unionized staff vote to approve new collective agreement"], 10 Jul 2014</ref> In the spring of 2017, the company offered, and the guild voted to accept, a one-year extension of this contract, which was then due to expire in 2018.

In 2017, ''The Globe and Mail'' refreshed its web design with a new pattern library and faster load times on all platforms. The new website is designed to display well on mobile, tablet, and desktop, with pages that highlight journalists and newer articles. The new website has won several awards, including an Online Journalism Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/globe-and-mail-wins-four-online-journalism-awards-leading-all-publications/article36521789/|title=Globe and Mail wins four Online Journalism Awards, including prize for general excellence|date=October 7, 2017}}</ref> ''The Globe and Mail'' also launched the News Photo Archive, a showcase of more than 10,000 photos from its historic collection dedicated to subscribers. In concert with the Archive of Modern Conflict, ''The Globe and Mail'' digitized tens of thousands of negatives and photo prints from film, dating from 1900 to 1998, when the film was last used in the newsroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/canada/canada-150/photoarchive/|title=The Globe and Mail News Photo Archive|date=July 1, 2017}}</ref>

==Report on Business==
{{for|Institute for Supply Management economic report|ISM Report On Business}}

"Report on Business", commonly referred to as "ROB", is the financial section of the newspaper. It is the most lengthy daily compilation of economic news in Canada,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} and is considered an integral part of the newspaper. Standard ROB sections are typically fifteen to twenty pages, and include the listings of major Canadian, US, and international [[stock]]s, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and currencies.

Every Saturday, a special "Report on Business Weekend" is released, which includes features on corporate lifestyle and [[personal finance]], and extended coverage of business news.  On the last Friday of every month, the ''Report on Business Magazine'' is released, the largest Canadian finance-oriented magazine.

[[Business News Network]] (formerly ROBtv) is a twenty-four-hour news and business television station, founded by ''The Globe and Mail'' but operated by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] through the companies' relationship with [[CTVglobemedia]].

==Controversies==

On September 25, 2012, ''The Globe and Mail'' announced it had disciplined high-profile staff columnist [[Margaret Wente]] after she admitted to [[plagiarism]].<ref>{{cite news|date=September 25, 2012|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/globe-takes-action-on-allegations-against-columnist/article4565683/?service=mobile|title= Globe takes action on allegations against columnist Margaret Wente|access-date=September 25, 2012}}</ref> The scandal emerged after [[University of Ottawa]] professor and [[blogger]], [[Carol Wainio]], repeatedly raised plagiarism accusations against Wente on her blog.<ref>{{cite news|date=September 25, 2012|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1261886--margaret-wente-affair-a-timeline-of-plagiarism-allegations |title=Margaret Wente affair: A timeline of plagiarism allegations|newspaper=The Toronto Star|access-date= September 25, 2012}}</ref>

On October 22, 2012, online Canadian magazine ''[[The Tyee]]'' published an article criticizing the ''Globe'''s "[[advertorial]]" policies and design. ''The Tyee'' alleged that the ''Globe'' intentionally blurred the lines between advertising and editorial content in order to offer premium and effective ad space to high-paying advertisers. ''The Tyee'' reporter Jonathan Sas cited an 8-page spread in the October 2, 2012, print edition, called "The Future of the Oil Sands", to illustrate the difficulty in distinguishing the spread from regular ''Globe'' content.

Former Minister [[Michael Chan (Canadian politician)|Michael Chan]] filed a libel lawsuit against ''The Globe and Mail'' in 2015, for $4.55 million after they allegedly "declined to retract their unfounded allegations" suggesting that Chan was "a risk to national security because of his ties to China".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/08/07/ontario-cabinet-minister-michael-chan-sues-globe-an-mail-for-455-million.html|title=Ontario cabinet minister Michael Chan sues Globe and Mail for $4.55 million {{!}} The Star|website=thestar.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>

==Political stance==
The ''Globe and Mail'' takes a [[center-right]] editorial stance.{{cn|date=October 2020}} It is less socially liberal than its competitor, the ''Toronto Star''.<ref name="Winter">Elke Winter, ''Us, Them and Others: Pluralism and National Identities in Diverse Societies'' (University of Toronto Press, 2011), p. 96.</ref> Canadian sociologist Elke Winter writes that "While the ''Globe'' has probably lost parts of its more conservative and corporate readership to the ''[[National Post]]'', it continues to cater to the Canadian political and intellectual elite" (such as managers and professionals).<ref name="Winter"/> The newspaper is considered an "upmarket" newspaper, in contrast to downmarket newspapers such as the ''[[Toronto Sun]]''.<ref>Nicholas Russell, ''Morals and the Media: Ethics in Canadian Journalism'' (2d ed. 2006: UBC Press), p. 6.</ref>

In [[List of Canadian federal general elections|federal general elections]], ''The Globe and Mail'' has endorsed different parties over time. The newspaper endorsed [[Stephen Harper]]'s  [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] in the 2006, 2008, and 2011 elections; in the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 election]], the paper again endorsed the Conservatives but called for the party's leader, Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], to step down. In previous elections, the paper endorsed the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] (2000, 2004); the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] (1984, 1988, 1997), a [[minority government]] for the Liberals in 1993 ("Let us declare firmly for a minority. We do not trust the Liberals to govern unguarded.").<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/federal-election-globe-editorial-endorsements-from-1984-to-now/article26827000/ Federal election: Globe editorial endorsements from 1984 to now], ''The Global & Mail'' (October 16, 2015).</ref>

While the paper was known as a generally conservative voice of the business establishment in the postwar decades, historian [[David Hayes (author)|David Hayes]], in a review of its positions, has noted that the ''Globe''{{'}}s editorials in this period "took a benign view of [[hippies]] and homosexuals; championed most aspects of the [[welfare state]]; opposed, after some deliberation, the [[Canada and the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]]; and supported [[legalizing marijuana]]". It was a December 12, 1967, ''Globe and Mail'' editorial<ref>"Unlocking the locked step of law and morality".
