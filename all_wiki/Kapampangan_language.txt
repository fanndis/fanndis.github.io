'''Kapampangan language''' is an [[Austronesian language]], and one of the eight major [[languages of the Philippines]]. It is the primary and predominant language of the entire province of [[Pampanga]] and southern [[Tarlac]], on the southern part of [[Luzon]]'s central plains geographic region, most of whom belong to the [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] ethnic group. Kapampangan is also spoken in northeastern [[Bataan]], as well as in the municipalities of [[Bulacan]], [[Nueva Ecija]], and [[Zambales]] that border Pampanga. A few [[Aeta]] groups in Central Luzon's southern part also understand and even speak Kapampangan as well. The language is known honorifically as ''Amánung Sísuan'' ("breastfed, or nurtured, language").<ref name="gruyter">{{cite book|author1=Ulrich Ammon |author2=Norbert Dittmar |author3=Klaus J.

==Classification==
Kapampangan is one of the [[Central Luzon languages]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. Its closest relatives are the [[Sambalic languages]] of [[Zambales]] province and the [[Bolinao language]] spoken in the towns of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] and [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]] in [[Pangasinan]]. These languages share the same reflex {{IPA|/j/}} of the proto-Austronesian consonant *R.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==History==
''Kapampangan'' is derived from the root word ''pampáng'' ("riverbank"). The language was historically spoken in the [[Kingdom of Tondo]], ruled by the [[Lakan]]s.

A number of Kapampangan dictionaries and grammar books were written during the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonial period]]. Diego Bergaño wrote two 18th-century books about the language: ''Arte de la lengua Pampanga''<ref name="Bergaño">Bergaño</ref> (first published in 1729) and ''Vocabulario de la lengua Pampanga''  (first published in 1732). Kapampangan produced two 19th-century literary giants; [[Anselmo Fajardo]] was noted for ''Gonzalo de Córdova'' and ''Comedia Heróica de la Conquista de Granada'', and playwright [[Juan Crisóstomo Soto]] wrote ''Alang Dios'' in 1901. "Crissotan" was written by [[Amado Yuzon]], Soto's 1950s contemporary and [[Nobel Prize]] nominee for peace and literature,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} to immortalize his contribution to Kapampangan literature.
<!-- does not fit flow of the section, copy-pasted from the source {{quote|In many gatherings, Kapampangans seem more confident and articulate in exchanging views and ideas among their own [Kabalen] "countrymen" in Tagalog (which is the vernacular in the Philippines) than they would in their own [native language]. For instance, many Catholic priests are now delivering their homilies in the Tagalog language during a Kapampangan liturgy while high school student meetings are conducted in the Tagalog language even if all the participants are Kapampangans.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060821142028/http://www.silinternational.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/pangilinan-Dispute%20on%20Orthography.pdf] </ref>}}-->

==Geographic distribution==
Kapampangan is predominantly spoken in the province of [[Pampanga]] and southern [[Tarlac]] ([[Bamban, Tarlac|Bamban]], [[Capas, Tarlac|Capas]], [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], [[San Jose, Tarlac|San Jose]], [[Gerona, Tarlac|Gerona]], [[La Paz, Tarlac|La Paz]], [[Victoria, Tarlac|Victoria]] and [[Tarlac City]]). It is also spoken in border communities of the provinces of [[Bataan]] ([[Dinalupihan, Bataan|Dinalupihan]], [[Hermosa, Bataan|Hermosa]] and [[Orani, Bataan|Orani]]), [[Bulacan]] ([[Baliuag, Bulacan|Baliuag]], [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel]], [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan|San Ildefonso]], [[Hagonoy, Bulacan|Hagonoy]], [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]], [[Pulilan, Bulacan|Pulilan]] and [[Calumpit, Bulacan|Calumpit]]), [[Nueva Ecija]] ([[Cabiao, Nueva Ecija|Cabiao]], [[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija|San Isidro]], [[Gapan City]] and [[Cabanatuan City]]) and [[Zambales]] ([[Olongapo City]] and [[Subic, Zambales|Subic]]). In Mindanao, a significant Kapampangan-speaking minority also exists in [[South Cotabato]], specifically in [[General Santos]] and the municipalities of [[Polomolok, South Cotabato|Polomolok]] and [[Tupi, South Cotabato|Tupi]]. According to the 2000 Philippine census, 2,312,870 people (out of the total population of 76,332,470) spoke Kapampangan as their native language.

==Phonology==
{{Contains special characters|IPA}}
Standard Kapampangan has 21 [[phoneme]]s: 15 [[consonant]]s and five [[vowel]]s; some western dialects have six vowels. Syllabic structure is relatively simple; each syllable contains at least one consonant and a vowel.

===Vowels===
Kapampangan has five vowel phonemes:
*{{IPA|/ə/}}, a [[close back unrounded vowel]] when unstressed; allophonic with {{IPA|/a/}}, an [[open front unrounded vowel]] similar to English "f''a''ther" when stressed
*{{IPA|/ɛ/}}, an [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] similar to English "b''e''d"
*{{IPA|/i/}}, a [[close front unrounded vowel]] similar to English "mach''i''ne"
*{{IPA|/o/}}, a [[close-mid back rounded vowel]] similar to English "f''o''rty"
*{{IPA|/u/}}, a [[close back rounded vowel]] similar to English "fl''u''te"

There are four main [[diphthong]]s: {{IPA|/aɪ/}}, {{IPA|/oɪ/}}, {{IPA|/aʊ/}}, and {{IPA|/iʊ/}}. In most dialects (including standard Kapampangan), {{IPA|/aɪ/}} and {{IPA|/aʊ/}} are reduced to {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} respectively. <!--Old version said [ɛ ~ e], [ɔ ~o] but I'm assuming that's just in reference to allophony, not a /ɛ/ {{angbr|e}} vs. /e/ {{angbr|ai}} distinction? --Tropylium
-->

Monophthongs have [[allophone]]s in unstressed and syllable-final positions:
*{{IPA|/a/}} becomes {{IPA|[ə]}} in all unstressed positions.
*Unstressed {{IPA|/i u/}} is usually pronounced {{IPA|[ɪ ʊ]}}, as in English "b''i''t" and "b''oo''k" respectively (except final syllables).
*In final syllables {{IPA|/i/}} can be pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ, i]}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} can be pronounced {{IPA|[o, u]}}.
** ''deni/reni'' ("these") can be pronounced [ˈdɛnɛ]/[ˈɾɛnɛ] or [ˈdɛni]/[ˈɾɛni]; ''seli'' ("bought") can be pronounced [ˈsɛlɛ] or [ˈsɛli]; ''kekami'' ("to us" [except you]) can be pronounced [kɛkəˈmɛ] or [kɛkəˈmi]; ''suerti'' can be pronounced [ˈswɛɾtɛ] or [ˈswɛɾti], ''sisilim'' ("dusk") can be pronounced [sɪˈsilɛm] or [sɪˈsilim].
** ''kanu'' ("he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly") can be pronounced [kaˈno] or [kaˈnu]; ''libru'' ("book") can be pronounced [libˈɾo] or [libˈɾu]; ''ninu'' ("who") can be pronounced [ˈnino] or [ˈninu]; ''kaku'' ("to me") can be pronounced [ˈkako] or [ˈkaku], and ''kamaru'' ("cricket") can be pronounced [kəməˈɾo] or [kəməˈɾu].
*Unstressed {{IPA|/e, o/}} are usually pronounced {{IPA|[ɪ, ʊ]}}, respectively (except final syllables).

===Consonants===
In the chart of Kapampangan consonants, all stops are unaspirated. The [[velar nasal]] occurs in all positions, including the beginning of a word. Unlike other languages of the Philippines but similar to [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], Kapampangan uses /h/ only in words of foreign origin.

*{{IPA|/k/}} tends to [[lenition|lenite]] to {{IPA|[x]}} between vowels.
*{{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[ɾ]}} are allophones in Kapampangan, and sometimes interchangeable; ''Nukarin la ring libru?'' can be ''Nukarin la ding libru?'' ("Where are the books?").
*A glottal stop at the end of a word is often omitted in the middle of a sentence and, unlike in most languages of the Philippines, is conspicuously absent word-internally; hence, Batiáuan's dropping of [[semivowels]] from its very name.

===Stress===
Stress is phonemic in Kapampangan. Primary stress occurs on the last or the next-to-last syllable of a word. Vowel lengthening accompanies primary or secondary stress, except when stress occurs at the end of a word. Stress shift can occur, shifting to the right or left to differentiate between nominal or verbal use (as in the following examples):<ref name="Forman, Michael, 1971, pp.28-29">Forman, Michael, 1971, pp.28-29</ref>
*''dápat'' ("should, ought to") → ''dapát'' ("deed, concern, business")
*''dapúg'' ("gather, burn trash") → ''dápug'' ("trash pile")

Stress shift can also occur when one word is derived from another through affixation; again, stress can shift to the right or the left:<ref name="Forman, Michael, 1971, pp.28-29"/>
*''ábe'' → ''abáyan'' ("company")
*''láso'' → ''lasáwan'' ("melt, digest")

==={{anchor|Historical sound changes}}Sound changes===
In Kapampangan, the [[Proto-Philippine language|proto-Philippine]] [[schwa]] vowel {{IPA|*ə}} merged to /a/ in most dialects of Kapampangan; it is preserved in some western dialects. Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*tanəm}} is ''tanam'' (to plant) in Kapampangan, compared with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ''tanim'', [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] ''tanom'' and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] tanem (grave).

Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*R}} merged with {{IPA|/j/}}. The Kapampangan word for "new" is ''bayu''; it is ''bago'' in Tagalog, ''baro'' in Ilocano, and ''baru'' in Indonesian.

==Grammar==

===Nouns===
Kapampangan nouns are not [[inflection|inflected]], but are usually preceded by case [[Marker (linguistics)|markers]]. There are three types of case markers: [[absolutive case|absolutive]] ([[nominative case|nominative]]), [[ergative case|ergative]] ([[genitive case|genitive]]), and [[oblique case|oblique]].

Unlike [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (which are [[nominative–accusative language]]s) and [[Inuit Language|Inuit]] and [[Basque Language|Basque]] (which are [[ergative–absolutive language]]s), Kapampangan has [[Austronesian alignment]] (in common with most Philippine languages). Austronesian alignment may work with nominative (and absolutive) or ergative (and absolutive) markers and pronouns.

Absolutive or nominative markers mark the actor of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb. Ergative or genitive markers mark the object (usually indefinite) of an intransitive verb and the actor of a transitive one. It also marks possession. Oblique markers, similar to prepositions in English, mark (for example) location and direction. Noun markers are divided into two classes: names of people (personal) and everything else (common).

====Examples====
*''Sinulat ku'' (I wrote).
*''Silatanan ke'' (I wrote to him).
*''Silatanan na ku'' (He [or she] wrote me).
*''Dintang ya'' (He [or she] has arrived). Note: ''Dintang ya'' = He arrived (or arrives); ''Dintang ne'' = He has arrived.
*''Sabian me kaku'' (Tell it to me).
*''Ninu ing minaus keka?'' (Who called you?)
*''Mamasa la'' (They are reading).
*''Mamangan la ring babi?'' (Are the pigs eating?)

Genitive pronouns follow the word they modify. Oblique pronouns can replace the genitive pronoun, but  precede the word they modify.

*''Ing bale ku;'' ''Ing kakung bale;'' ''Ing kanakung bale'' (my house)

The dual pronoun ''ikata'' and the inclusive pronoun ''ikatamu'' refer to the first and second person. The exclusive pronoun ''ikamí'' refers to the first and third persons.

*''Ala katang nasi.'' (We [dual] do not have rice).
*''Ala tamung nasi.'' (We [inclusive] do not have rice).
*''Ala keng nasi'', ''Ala kaming nasi'' (We [exclusive] do not have rice).

Kapampangan differs from many [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] in requiring the pronoun even if the noun it represents, or the [[antecedent (grammar)|grammatical antecedent]], is present.

*''Dintang ya i(y) Erning'' (not ''dintang i(y) Erning''; Ernie arrived).
*''Mamasa la ri Maria at Juan'' (not ''mamasa ri Maria at Juan''; Maria and Juan are reading).
*''Silatanan na kang José'' (not ''silatanan kang José''; José wrote you).

====Special forms====
The pronouns ''ya'' and ''la'' have special forms when they are used in conjunction with the words ''ati'' (there is/are) and ''ala'' (there is/are not).

*''Ati yu king Pampanga'' (He is in Pampanga).
*''Ala lu ring doktor keni'', ''Ala lu ding doktor keni'' (the doctors are no longer here).

Both ''ati yu'' and ''ati ya'' are correct. The plural form ("they are") is ''atilu'' and ''atila''. Both ''ala la'' and ''ala lu'' are correct in the plural form. The singular forms are ''ala ya'' and ''ala yu''.

====Pronoun combinations====
Kapampangan pronouns follow a certain order after verbs (or particles, such as negation words). The [[Clitic#Enclitic|enclitic]] pronoun is always followed by another pronoun (or [[discourse marker]]:
*''Ikit da ka'' (I saw you).
*''Silatanan na ku'' (He wrote to me).

Pronouns also combine to form a [[portmanteau]] pronoun:
*''Ikit ke'' (I saw her).
*''Dinan kong kwalta (I will give them money).''

Portmanteau pronouns are not usually used in questions and with the word ''naman'':
*''Akakit me?'' (Do you see him?)
*''Buri nya naman yan'', ''buri ne murin yan'' (He likes that, too).

In the following chart, blank entries denote combinations which are deemed impossible. Column headings denote pronouns in the absolutive case, and the row headings denote the [[ergative case]].

===Demonstrative pronouns===
Kapampangan's demonstrative pronouns differ from other Philippine languages by having separate forms for singular and plural.

|''oreta''
|''keta''
|}

The demonstrative pronouns ''ini'' and ''iti'' (and their respective forms) both mean "this", but each has distinct uses. ''Iti'' usually refers to something abstract, but may also refer to concrete nouns: ''iting musika'' (this music), ''iti ing gagawan mi'' (this is what we do). ''Ini'' is always concrete: ''ining libru'' (this book), ''ini ing asu nang Juan'' (this is Juan's dog).

In their locative forms, ''keni'' is used when the person spoken to is not near the subject spoken of; ''keti'' is used when the person spoken to is near the subject spoken of. Two people in the same country will refer to their country as ''keti'', but will refer to their respective towns as ''keni''; both mean "here".

The plural forms of a demonstrative pronoun and its existential form (for the nearest addressee) are exceptions. The plural of ''iyan'' is ''den/ren''; the plural of ''niyan'' is ''daren''; the plural of ''kanyan'' is ''karen'', and the plural of ''oyan'' is ''oren''. The existential form of ''iyan'' is ''ken''.

*''Nanu ini?'' (What's this?)
*''Mangabanglu la rening sampaga'', ''Mangabanglu la dening sampaga'' (These flowers smell nice).
*''Ninu ing lalaking ita?'' (Who is that man?)
*''Me keni'', ''munta ka keni'' (Come here).
*''Ati ku keti'', ''atsu ku keni'', ''atyu ku keni'' (I am here).
*''Mangan la keta'' (They will eat there).
*''Ninu ing anak a yan?'' (Who is that child?)
*''Uyta/Oyta ya pala ing salamin mu!'' (So that's where your glasses are!)
*''E ku pa menakit makanyan/makanini'' (I haven't seen one of these before).
*''Manyaman la ren/Manyaman la den'' (Those are delicious).
*''Ayni/Areni/Oreni la reng adwang regalo para keka'' (Here are the two gifts for you).
*''Buri daka!'' (I like you!)
*''Kaluguran daka!'' (I love you!)
*''Mangan Tana!'' (Let's eat!)
*''Edaka buring mawala!'' (I don't want to lose you!)

==={{anchor|Conjugation chart}}Verbs===
Kapampangan verbs are morphologically complex, and take a variety of affixes reflecting focus, aspect and mode. The language has [[Austronesian alignment]], and the verbs change according to triggers in the sentence (better known as voices). Kapampangan has five voices: agent, patient, goal, locative, and cirumstantial. The circumstantial voice prefix is used for instrument and benefactee subjects.

The [[direct case]] morphemes in Kapampangan are ''ing'' (which marks singular subjects) and ''reng'', for plural subjects. Non-subject agents are marked with the ergative-case ''ning''; non-subject patients are marked with the accusative-case ''-ng'', which is [[clitic]]ized onto the preceding word.<ref>In the examples, the word to which the accusative case marker attaches is a pronoun or [[portmanteau]] pronoun that is obligatorily present in the same clause as the noun with which it is [[Coreference|co-referential]].  In sentences with an agent trigger, the pronoun co-refers with the agent subject.  In sentences with a non-agent trigger, the portmanteau pronoun co-refers with both the ergative agent and the non-agent subject, which is marked with direct case.</ref>

==== Ambiguities and irregularities ====
Speakers of other Philippine languages find Kapampangan verbs difficult because some verbs belong to unpredictable verb classes and some verb forms are ambiguous. The root word ''sulat'' (write) exists in Tagalog and Kapampangan:
*''Susulat'' means "is writing" in Kapampangan and "will write" in Tagalog.
*''Sumulat'' means "will write" in Kapampangan and "wrote" in Tagalog. It is the infinitive in both languages.
*''Sinulat'' means "wrote" in both languages. In Kapampangan it is in the actor focus (with long i: {{IPA|[ˌsi:ˈnu:lat]}}) or object focus (with short i: {{IPA|[siˈnu:lat]}}), and object focus only in Tagalog.

The object-focus suffix ''-an'' represents two focuses; the only difference is that one conjugation preserves ''-an'' in the completed aspect, and it is dropped in the other conjugation:
*''Bayaran'' (to pay someone): ''bayaran'' (will pay someone), ''babayaran'' (is paying someone), ''beyaran'' (paid someone)
*''Bayaran'' (to pay for something): ''bayaran'' (will pay for something), ''babayaran'' (is paying for something), ''binayad'' (paid for something)

Other Philippine languages have separate forms; Tagalog has ''-in'' and ''-an'' in, [[Bikol language|Bikol]] and most of the [[Visayan languages]] have ''-on'' and ''-an'', and [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]] has ''-en'' and ''-an'' due to historical sound changes in the proto-Philippine /*e/.

A number of actor-focus verbs do not use the infix ''-um-'', but are usually conjugated like other verbs which do (for example, ''gawa'' (to do), ''bulus'' (to immerse), ''terak'' (to dance), ''lukas'' (to take off), ''sindi'' (to smoke), ''saklu'' (to fetch), ''takbang'' (to step) and ''tuki'' (to accompany). Many of these verbs undergo a change of vowel instead of taking the infix ''-in-'' (completed aspect). In the actor focus (''-um-'' verbs), this happens only to verbs with the vowel /u/ in the first syllable; ''lukas'' (to take off) is conjugated ''lukas'' (will take off), ''lulukas'' (is taking off), and ''likas'' (took off).

This change of vowel also applies to certain object-focus verbs in the completed aspect. In addition to /u/ becoming /i/, /a/ becomes /e/ in certain cases (for example, ''dela'' [brought something], ''semal'' [worked on something] and ''seli'' [bought]).

There is no written distinction between the two ''mag-'' affixes; ''magsalita'' may mean "is speaking" or "will speak", but there is an audible difference. {{IPA|[mɐɡsaliˈtaʔ]}} means "will speak" while {{IPA|[ˌmaːɡsaliˈtaʔ]}} means "is speaking".

Due to the influence of Buddhism and Hinduism, Kapampangan also acquired words from [[Sanskrit]]. A few examples are:

*''Aláya'', "home", from the Sanskrit आलय ''[[alaya]]''
*''Kalma'', "fate", from the Sanskrit कर्म ''[[karma]]''
*''Damla'', "divine law", from the Sanskrit धर्म ''[[dharma]]''

*''Upáya'', "power", from the Sanskrit उपाय ''[[upaya]]''
*''Siuálâ'', "voice", from the Sanskrit स्वर ''[[swara|svara]]''
*''Lúpa'', "face", from the Sanskrit रुपा ''[[Rūpa|rupa]]''
*''Sabla'', "every", from the Sanskrit सर्व ''sarva''

The language also has many Spanish [[loanword]]s, including ''kómusta'' (from ''cómo estás'', "Hello/How are you?"), ''suérti'' (from ''suerte'', "luck"), ''kurus'' (from ''cruz'', "cross"), ''karni'' (from ''carne'', "meat"), ''kórsunada'' (from ''corazonada'', "crush") and ''kasapégo'' (from ''casa fuego'', "matchbox") and others such as times, for countings and numbers.

==Orthography==
[[Image:Amanung Sisuan in Kulitan.svg|thumb|alt=Kulitan writing|''Amánung Sísuan'' (honorific name for "mother language" (literally "nurtured or suckled language") in Kulitan, Kapampangan's indigenous writing system]]
Kapampangan, like most Philippine languages, uses the Latin alphabet. Before the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, it was written with the [[Kulitan alphabet]]. Kapampangan is usually written in one of three different writing systems: ''sulat Baculud'', ''sulat Wawa'' and a hybrid of the two, ''Amung Samson''.<ref name="K or C">Pangilinan, M. R. M. (2006, January). Kapampángan or Capampáñgan: settling the dispute on the Kapampángan Romanized orthography. In Paper at Tenth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan (pp. 17-20).</ref>

The first system (''sulat Baculud'', also known as ''tutung Capampangan'' or ''tutung Kapampangan'' in the ''sulat Wawa'' system) is based on [[Spanish orthography]], a feature of which involved the use of the letters ⟨c⟩ and ⟨q⟩ to represent the phoneme /k/ (depending on the vowel sound following the phoneme). ⟨C⟩ was used before /a/, /o/ and /u/ (''ca'', ''co'' and ''cu''), and ⟨q⟩ was used with ⟨u⟩ before the vowels /e/ and /i/ (''que'', ''qui''). The Spanish-based orthography is primarily associated with literature by authors from Bacolor and the text used on the Kapampangan ''Pasion''.<ref name="K or C"/>

The second system, the ''Sulat Wawa'', is an "indigenized" form which preferred ⟨k⟩ over ⟨c⟩ and ⟨q⟩ in representing the phoneme /k/. This orthography, based on the [[Abakada alphabet]] was used by writers from Guagua and rivaled writers from the nearby town of Bacolor.<ref name="K or C"/>

The third system, ''Amung Samson'' hybrid orthography, intends to resolve the conflict in spelling between proponents of the ''sulat Baculud'' and ''sulat Wawa''. This system was created by former Catholic priest Venancio Samson during the 1970s to translate the Bible into Kapampangan. It resolved conflicts between the use of ⟨q⟩ and ⟨c⟩ (in ''sulat Baculud'') and ⟨k⟩ (in ''sulat Wawa'') by using ⟨k⟩ before ⟨e⟩ and ⟨i⟩ (instead of [qu]⟩ and using ⟨c⟩ before ⟨a⟩, ⟨o⟩, and ⟨u⟩ (instead of ⟨k⟩). The system also removed ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨ñ⟩ (from Spanish), replacing them with ⟨ly⟩ and ⟨ny⟩.<ref name="K or C"/>

Orthography has been debated by Kapampangan writers, and orthographic styles may vary by writer. The ''sulat Wawa'' system has become the popular method of writing due to the influence of the Tagalog-based [[Filipino language]] (the national language) and its orthography. The ''sulat Wawa'' system is used by the Akademyang Kapampangan and the poet Jose Gallardo.<ref name="K or C"/>

===Attempts at reform===
[[File:PampangoScript.png|thumb|alt=Man writing on a large sheet of paper on a floor|275px|A Kapampangan calligraphist writes in Kulitan script during the inauguration of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]]'s Extension Program on Pampanga's new campus.]]
From the 10th century AD to 1571, before the Spanish conquest of Lúsung Guo which resulted in the creation of the Province of Pampanga, Kapampangans used a writing system known as {{lang-pam|label=none|kúlitan}} or {{lang-pam|label=none|súlat Kapampángan}}. [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] missionaries studied the Kapampangan language and its writing system.<ref>{{cite book | title=An introduction to Kulitan, the indigenous Kapampangan script | publisher=Center for Kapampangan Studies, Philippines. | author=Pangilinan, Michael | year=2012}}</ref>

As late as 1699, more than a century after the Spanish conquest, Spaniards continued studying the Kapampangan language and writing system. The Spanish introduced a Romanized orthography, known as the [[Spanish orthography|Bácolor orthography]] ({{lang-pam|label=none|súlat Bakúlud}}). Because of the number of works written in this orthography, which uses the letters ''q'', ''c'', ''f'', ''ñ'' and ''ll'', its users dub it {{lang-pam|label=none|tutûng Kapampángan}}—"genuine Pampangan".<ref name="K or C"/>

By the end of Spanish colonial rule, the {{lang-fil|label=none|[[abakada]]}}, which was an indigenized orthography based on [[José Rizal]]'s use of ⟨k⟩ for ⟨c⟩ and ⟨qu⟩ but which went further by eliminating ⟨ch⟩, ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨ñ⟩ and modifying general spelling rules, gained favor among [[Philippine nationalism|Philippine nationalist]] writers among the Pampangans, two of them being [[Arturo Tolentino]] and [[Mónico Mercado]].<ref name="K or C"/> As many of these writers, including Tolentino and Mercado, were from [[Guagua]], the ''abakada'' came to be known among Pampangans as {{lang-pam|label=none|súlat Uáuâ}}, "Guagua writing". Another Pampangan and member of the Institute of National Language (INL), [[Zolio Hilario]], would later support the imposition of {{lang-pam|label=none|súlat Uáuâ}}, with the addition of the [[Filipino language|Tagalog]] ⟨w⟩, on the Pampangan language. This action unwittingly introduced into the Pampangan literary scene the bitter orthographic conflict which had by then begun to take root at the national level between writers supportive of one spelling system and the other.<ref name="K or C"/>

In 1970 (before his translation of the [[Bible]] into Kapampangan), Venancio Samson called the dispute over Kapampangan orthography to the attention of the Philippine Bible Society and submitted a proposal aimed at reconciling the old and the new spelling in Kapampangan writing with what is known as Ámung Samson's Hybrid Orthography. Samson's synthesis was readily accepted by the [[Archdiocese of San Fernando|Catholic Archdiocese of Pampanga]], which used it in most of its Kapampangan publications during the early 1970s.<ref name="K or C"/>

In 1997, the organization Batiáuan ("sentry") said that the major obstacle to popularizing Kapampangan was the intense conflict over orthography. The prediction that the Kapampangans would be absorbed by the Tagalogs, at least linguistically, was seen by Kapampangan groups as a real threat, since Tagalog words were replacing indigenous words in spoken Kapampangan. They revised the {{lang-fil|label=none|abakada}} in Kapampangan writing, removing the alien ⟨w⟩ and the {{lang-es|label=none|[[grave accent|acento grave]]}}. According to Pampangan Academy {{lang-pam|label=none|Akademyang Kapampangan}}, the Batiáuan revision complicates Kapampangan writing and confuses adherents of their proposed orthography. Batiáuan insists that the diacritical marks are essential in written Kapampangan, because many words are spelled the same but are pronounced differently. From this perspective, diacritical marks facilitate understanding instead of complicating the language.<ref name="K or C"/>

In 2018, in its ''Statement on the Harmonization of Orthographies'', the [[Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino]] announced the "harmonization" of the spelling systems of all the indigenous languages in the Philippines, on the basis that all "belong[ed] to [[Philippine languages|one family]] of languages" and on the grounds that the previous orthographies were "inefficient" and of "Spanish" origin.<ref name=harmony>https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1052580</ref> While users of the Bácolor system have indeed [[Radicalization|dug their heels in]] for the [[Spanish orthography|Spanish orthographic norms]], the same cannot be said for users of the indigenized [[Guagua]] system popularized by Hilario and later improved on by the Pampangans themselves. In any case, the KWF's [[Filipino orthography|harmonized orthography]] would be compulsory except for the dwindling number of "older users".<ref name=harmony/> Proponents of the adoption of {{lang-pam|label=none|kúlitan}} cite the endless orthographic disputes over the Latin script as a reason to shift to the modernized precolonial [[Brahmic script]].<ref name=pampangan_infighting>http://siuala.com/pauaga-prologue-to-the-kulitan-book/</ref>
