'''Jared Corey Kushner''' (born January 10, 1981) is an American investor, real estate developer, and newspaper publisher who is a [[Senior Advisor to the President of the United States|senior advisor]] to his [[father-in-law]], [[Donald Trump]], the 45th [[president of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bennet |first1=Brian |title=Inside Jared Kushner's Unusual White House Role |url=https://time.com/5766186/jared-kushner-interview/ |website=Time |access-date=July 16, 2020 |date=January 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200713054214/https://time.com/5766186/jared-kushner-interview/ |archive-date=July 13, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Kushner is the son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]] and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.

During the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. In 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor, raising concerns about [[nepotism]]. He also stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration.<ref name=":9" /> Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.

As senior advisor to [[President Trump]], Kushner pushed strongly for the [[First Step Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored the [[Trump peace plan]] in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020 and widely viewed as highly favorable for Israel.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jared Kushner isn't even trying to sell his Middle East 'peace plan' to Palestinians|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/kushner-isnt-even-trying-sell-middle-east-peace-plan-palestine-2020-1|last=Haltiwanger|first=John|website=Business Insider|access-date=May 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200529092508/https://www.businessinsider.com/kushner-isnt-even-trying-sell-middle-east-peace-plan-palestine-2020-1|archive-date=May 29, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Kushner was the primary [[Trump administration]] participant in talks regarding the [[Middle East Peace Process]], leading to the signing of the [[Abraham Accords]] in 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wood |first1=Graeme |title=Why the UAE Made Peace With Israel |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/why-uae-made-peace-israel/615247/ |website=The Atlantic |access-date=15 August 2020 |date=13 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Evangelicals, Democrats praise Trump's Israel-UAE deal: 'A peaceful Middle East is possible'|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/evangelicals-democrats-praise-trumps-israel-uae-deal-a-peaceful-middle-east-is-possible.html|access-date=2020-08-21|website=www.christianpost.com|language=en}}</ref>

=== Conflicts of interest ===

While serving in the Trump administration, Kushner retained ownership of businesses, which drew criticism from government ethics experts who said it created conflicts of interest.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|date=2020|title=Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner earned at least $36 million in outside income last year, new disclosures show|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ivanka-trump-and-jared-kushner-earned-at-least-36-million-in-outside-income-last-year-new-disclosures-show/2020/07/31/9eb71e66-d36a-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801013848/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ivanka-trump-and-jared-kushner-earned-at-least-36-million-in-outside-income-last-year-new-disclosures-show/2020/07/31/9eb71e66-d36a-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html|archive-date=August 1, 2020}}</ref>

After his appointment as Senior Advisor to Donald Trump (in January 2017), Kushner resigned as head of his family's real-estate firm, Kushner Companies, and partially divested himself of some of its assets, including his stake in 666 Fifth Avenue. However, he did not actually sell off his assets or set up a blind trust with outside management. Instead, he transferred ownership of some of his assets to his brother and to a trust overseen by his mother. ''The New York Times'' reported that Kushner managed to retain "the vast majority of his interest in Kushner Companies.
