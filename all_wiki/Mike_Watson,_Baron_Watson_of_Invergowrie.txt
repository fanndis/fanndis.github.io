==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
Watson was born in [[Cambuslang]], [[South Lanarkshire]], but his family moved to [[Invergowrie]], [[Perth and Kinross]] when he was very young. He was educated at Invergowrie Primary School, the [[High School of Dundee]] and [[Heriot-Watt University]], Edinburgh, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A. Hons]] in Economics and [[Industrial Relations]] in 1974.

Prior to entering politics Watson worked as a tutor/organiser for the [[Workers' Educational Association]] and in the trade union movement, for the [[Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs]] (ASTMS) and the [[Manufacturing, Science and Finance]] union (MSF).

==Political career==
Watson was elected to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] as [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]] at a [[1989 Glasgow Central by-election|by-election in 1989]], following the death of [[Bob McTaggart]] MP. He was re-elected in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 election]] and represented that constituency until it was abolished in 1997. He sought the nomination from the Labour party to run for the [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Govan]] seat at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]], but after initially winning the nomination by one vote, he lost a re-run to [[Mohammad Sarwar (politician)|Mohammad Sarwar]].

On 6 November 1997, he was created a [[Life peer]]age as '''Baron Watson of Invergowrie''', of [[Invergowrie]] in [[Perth and Kinross]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=54946 |date=12 November 1997 |page=12703}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-39024|title=Watson of Invergowrie, Baron, (Michael Goodall Watson) (born 1 May 1949) {{!}} WHO'S WHO & WHO WAS WHO|website=www.ukwhoswho.com|language=en|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u39024|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>

In 1999 Lord Watson was elected to the Scottish Parliament to represent the [[Glasgow Cathcart (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Cathcart]] constituency and was re-elected in 2003. On 20 July 1999 Watson announced his intention to introduce the ''Protection of Wild Mammals'' bill as a member's bill to the Scottish Parliament to outlaw [[fox hunting]]. The bill passed a vote 83–36 on 13 February 2002<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1823479.stm|title=Watson's pride over hunting ban|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=15 February 2002|accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> and received [[Royal Assent]] on 15 March, becoming the [[Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002]] and becoming law on 1 August. This was a precursor to the [[Hunting Act 2004]] banning fox hunting in England and Wales.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

When [[Jack McConnell]] became [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] in 2001, Watson entered the [[Scottish Executive]] as Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. He left the Executive in 2003, having lost his position in a reshuffle after the [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003 election]].<ref name = "not guilty"/> He subsequently became deputy convener of the enterprise and culture committee.<ref name = "not guilty"/>

On 15 November 2004, Watson was charged with wilful fire raising, and the Labour whip was withdrawn from him in the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments.<ref name = "not guilty"/> On 1 September 2005 he admitted the offence and resigned from the Scottish Parliament.<ref name = "guilty plea"/> Watson was also expelled from the Labour Party when the sentence was announced.<ref name="sentence"/> After serving a prison sentence he was released in May 2006.

In January 2007 Watson was appointed as an Associate Director with Caledonia Consulting, while also attending the House of Lords on a regular basis.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Watson was re-admitted to membership of the Labour Party in July 2012, after a vote of the National Executive Committee.<ref name = "record">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/labour-blasted-after-firebug-peer-1444710|title=Labour blasted after firebug peer Mike Watson is welcomed back into party seven years after hotel blaze|work=Daily Record|publisher=Trinity Mirror|date=19 November 2012|accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> In September 2015, [[Jeremy Corbyn]] appointed Watson as the Labour spokesman on education in the Lords.<ref name=nelson/>

==Fire-raising conviction==
On 15 November 2004, Lord Watson was charged with two counts of "[[wilful fire raising]]" after a private reception at [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Prestonfield Hotel]] following the [[Scottish Politician of the Year]] awards on 11 November.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4055255.stm |title=MSP bailed on fireraising charges |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=30 November 2004 |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> The first alleged that he set fire to a curtain in the hotel's reception, and the second that he set fire to a curtain in the hotel's Yellow Room. On being charged, the Labour [[whip (politics)|whip]] was suspended in the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments.<ref name="not guilty"/>

After initially registering not guilty pleas to both charges on 23 August 2005,<ref name="not guilty">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4176042.stm|title=MSP denies fire-raising charges|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=23 August 2005|accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> he changed his plea on 1 September to guilty on the first count, and had a not guilty plea accepted on the second charge.<ref name="guilty plea">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4204186.stm|title=Peer pleads guilty to fire charge|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref>

On the same day that Lord Watson admitted his guilt, he resigned from the Scottish Parliament. He resigned as a director of [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United Football Club]].<ref name="guilty plea"/> It was not possible for a life peer to resign from the [[House of Lords]] at that time and there was no provision for peers convicted of criminal offences to be stripped of their titles. Such legislation was last proposed following the conviction of [[Jeffrey Archer]] for [[perjury]] in 2001, but rejected.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

On 22 September 2005, Lord Watson was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment.<ref name="sentence">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4269808.stm|title=Fire-raising peer sent to prison|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=22 September 2005|accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> Sheriff [[Kathrine Mackie]] justified the sentence, stating that there was both "a significant risk of re-offending" and that Lord Watson offered no explanation. She also told Lord Watson that consumption of alcohol "neither excuses nor fully explains your behaviour". The sentence was reduced from 20 months to 16 because Watson had pleaded guilty before the case reached trial.<ref name="sentence"/> Watson appealed against his sentence on 23 March 2006 but the appeal judges refused to cut the term, and he was returned to prison. After serving half of his sentence (eight months), he was released on 23 May 2006.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/1262F80DE5670AF0?p=UKNB|title=Fire-raiser Lord Watson told to do the honourable thing|last=Lydall|first=Ross|date=5 February 2009|work=The Scotsman|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>

== Views on Jeremy Corbyn ==

In an interview with [[The House (magazine)|The House magazine]] in March 2017, Lord Watson was asked whether Labour could win a UK general election under [[Jeremy Corbyn]]. He said: "Probably not. There are trends there that suggest we're not getting through and the result in [[2017 Copeland by-election|Copeland]] certainly suggested that, so it will be difficult to turn that around. But we shouldn't underestimate the extent to which the government can get into difficulties over the [[Brexit|European Union exit]] negotiations. It's not going to be anything approaching plain sailing for them." <ref>https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/84077/excl-labour-frontbencher-we-would</ref>
