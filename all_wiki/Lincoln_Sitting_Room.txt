The '''Lincoln Sitting Room''' is a small [[sitting room]] located next to the [[Lincoln Bedroom]] on the second floor of the [[White House]]. It was used as the White House telegraph room from 1865 to 1902 (until the [[West Wing]] was built). It is furnished in Victorian-style to match the bedroom. The overstuffed sofa and matching chair were formerly furnishings in the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]]. The [[White House#Kennedy restoration|Kennedy restoration]] in 1963 restored it to Victorian-style, and it has been maintained in the same style since.

The room became a favorite hide-away of President [[Richard Nixon]] who had it replicated in [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum|his presidential library]].
