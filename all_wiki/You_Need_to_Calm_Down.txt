The video is set in a colorful [[trailer park]]. Swift awakens in her trailer, wearing a bathrobe over a swimsuit, with an embroidery containing the [[Cher]] quote "Mom, I am a Rich Man" hanging on a wall.<ref name="VultureJG">{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-video-easter-eggs.html|title=Every Easter Egg in Taylor Swift's 'You Need to Calm Down' Music Video|first=Jill|last=Gutowitz|website=Vulture|date=June 18, 2019|accessdate=June 18, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190618032518/https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-video-easter-eggs.html|archivedate=June 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Swift throws her phone onto her bed, which then gives off sparks and starts a fire in the trailer. She nonchalantly walks to a pool, ignoring her burning trailer. She goes into the pool, lying on a float, while looking at the camera and singing.The camera then switches to other residents in the trailer park and their activities, including Mayfield dancing, Hart weightlifting a [[boombox]] and Cox watering her yard of [[plastic flamingo]]es and greeting Lockhart, who promptly faints.

The scene cuts to Swift walking and dancing down a street with Hall, interspersed with scenes of Kiyoko shooting an arrow into a target with the number "5" (a clue to Swift's next promotional single "[[The Archer (song)|The Archer]]", the fifth track on the album), protestors holding placards with anti-gay slogans (a reference to a real-life religious group that picketed Swift's concerts),<ref name="VogueCover2019"/> Ciara officiating a wedding between Ferguson and Mikita, and Rippon serving [[snow cone]]s to customers from a stall. Swift also holds a tea party with the Fab Five and Hall. In another trailer, Lambert tattoos the words "Cruel Summer" (later revealed to be a song on the album) onto DeGeneres' right arm. In the next scene, Swift and other residents [[sun tanning|sun tan]] while ignoring the heckling protestors, followed by Porter walking down the middle of the two crowds wearing a dress.

The scene shifts to a "pop queen pageant" with the contestants dressed as numerous female singers. RuPaul walks down the lineup with a crown decorated with [[emerald]]s and [[fleur-de-lis]] motifs,<ref name="VultureJG"/> but instead of crowning a winner, he throws it in the air. A food fight begins, with Swift appearing in a french fries costume and Perry in a hamburger suit. The two see and walk towards each other. Elsewhere, Reynolds is portraying [[Norman Rockwell]] working on a painting of the [[Stonewall Inn]].<ref name="VultureJG"/><ref name="IndiewireJD"/> Swift and Perry smile, dance and share a hug. At the end of the video, a message appears urging viewers to sign Swift's Change.org petition for the United States Senate to pass the Equality Act.
