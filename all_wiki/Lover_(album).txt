'''''Lover''''' is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift enlisted producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]], and [[Joel Little]] for the project. 

Inspired by the connections felt with fans during her [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] (2018), Swift sought to make an album with bright and lighter tones by delving deep into her personal life, departing from the dark sound of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). She defined ''Lover'' as a "love letter to love itself" that celebrates the full spectrum of love. It also incorporates politically charged themes, such as [[feminism]], disillusionment and [[LGBT rights]]. ''Lover'' is primarily a 1980s [[retro style|retro]]-styled [[Pop music|pop]] record that combines [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] with influences from [[Country music|country]], [[funk]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]. The album's artwork and visuals use a [[summer]] theme consisting of [[pastel (color)|pastel colors]].

Contemporary critics received ''Lover'' with mostly positive reviews. Praise centered on Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity, while a few critics found the album sprawling and inconsistent. The album contains collaborations with [[Brendon Urie]] and [[the Dixie Chicks]], and was supported by four singles: "[[Me!]]", "[[You Need to Calm Down]]", "[[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|Lover]]", and "[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]", the first three of which reached the top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In the United States, ''Lover'' was Swift's sixth number-one album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]]. All of its 18 tracks charted simultaneously on the Hot 100, breaking the all-time record for most simultaneous entries. The album topped the charts in several other countries, including Canada, Australia, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Selling 3.2&nbsp;million copies in 2019, it was the world's best-selling studio album of the year.

At the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]], the album received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]], and its singles "You Need to Calm Down" and "Lover" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. ''Lover'' won [[American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album|Favorite Pop/Rock Album]] at the [[American Music Awards of 2019|American Music Awards]], and out of 17 nominations at [[MTV Video Music Awards]], its music videos won four. ''Lover'' was listed as one of the best albums of 2019 by numerous publications.

Speculation of the album began on February 24, 2019, when Swift posted a photo of seven palm trees with a pastel blue backdrop and superimposed stars on her [[Instagram]] account, which the singer later confirmed was the day she finished the album.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elizabeth|first=De|title=Taylor Swift Might Have Just Dropped a Huge Clue About Her Next Album |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album|website=Teen Vogue|access-date=July 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326190044/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album|archive-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name="EWMay">{{cite magazine|last=Suskind|first=Alex|date=May 9, 2019|title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135902/https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|archive-date=August 12, 2019|access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref> The post generated widespread theories online, with the majority of media and fans interpreting it to be about Swift's seventh studio album.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lindsay|first=Kathryn|date=February 27, 2019|title=Taylor Swift Responded To Those Theories About Her New Album|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/225424/taylor-swift-album-7-instagram-clues|access-date=July 23, 2020|website=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=February 28, 2019|title=All the signs Taylor Swift is dropping her new album soon|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/taylor-swift/2019-instagram-album-news-theories/|access-date=July 23, 2020|website=[[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bruner|first=Raisa|date=March 15, 2019|title=New Taylor Swift Music Is Here.

Swift encouraged fans to find the forthcoming album's title in the "Me!" video. In a May 2019 interview for ''[[The Independent]]'', Swift was asked about the clues to the album title; she answered "I think you see it once, and you hear it twice", which led fans to believe that ''Lover'' is the title, as the word appears once in the video and twice in the lyrics of "Me!". In the video, the word ''Lover'' appeared on a [[Neon lighting|neon light-up sign]] in the background.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=Savannah|title=Taylor Swift's New Album Title Hint Suggests That Apparently Fans May Already Know It|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-new-album-title-hint-suggests-that-apparently-fans-may-already-know-it-17921363|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621150341/https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-new-album-title-hint-suggests-that-apparently-fans-may-already-know-it-17921363|archive-date=June 21, 2019|access-date=June 21, 2019|website=Bustle}}</ref><ref name="Album title">{{Cite web|last=Bailey|first=Alyssa|date=May 24, 2019|title=Taylor Swift Gives Away What Her TS7's Album Title Is – Taylor Swift 'Lover' Hints Interview and Songs|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a27582853/taylor-swift-lover-album-title-hints/|access-date=July 3, 2020|website=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]}}</ref> On June 13, 2019, she confirmed the album title in an Instagram live-stream, and that ''Lover'' would be released on August 23, 2019.<ref name="release">{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5606187/taylor-swift-album-release-date-2019/|first=Raisa|last=Bruner|title=Taylor Swift Just Announced the Summer Release Date for Her New Album Lover and Next Song|date=June 13, 2019|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=June 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613235726/https://time.com/5606187/taylor-swift-album-release-date-2019/|archive-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> Swift also announced that the album's second single, "[[You Need to Calm Down]]", would be released the next day on June 14, followed by its music video three days later.<ref name="billboardpop">{{cite web |last=Atkinson|first=Katie|title=Taylor Swift Announces New Song 'You Need to Calm Down' & 'Lover' Album Release Date |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8515910/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-lover-album-release-date-cover |website=Billboard|date=June 13, 2019|access-date=June 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190614004337/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8515910/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-lover-album-release-date-cover |archive-date=June 14, 2019}}</ref> On July 22, Swift revealed information about the deluxe edition of the album; the next day, "[[The Archer (song)|The Archer]]" was released as the only [[Promotional recording|promotional single]] from ''Lover''.<ref name=":8" /> A week prior to the album release, on August 16, Swift released the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] as the third single from ''Lover'' and revealed the album's track-list on her social media.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8527633/taylor-swift-lover-track-list|title=Taylor Swift Unveils 'Lover' Track List|first=Rania|last=Aniftos|magazine=Billboard|date=August 16, 2019|access-date=August 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817020143/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8527633/taylor-swift-lover-track-list|archive-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref>

== Conception ==
Inspired by the "positive energy" she felt during her [[Reputation Stadium Tour]], ''Lover'' was conceived by the "symbiotic relationship" Swift has with her fans, who led her to feel a "tonal shift", and helped her "dig out of the darker era of ''Reputation''". Swift stated she had an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] during the tour, that "despite the caricature that she thought had been created of her, there were many people who saw what others had simply refused to"; she added: "I would look out into the audience and I'd see these amazing, thoughtful, caring, wonderful, empathetic people". Swift explained, "so often with our takedown culture, talking shit about a celebrity is basically the same as talking shit about the new [[iPhone]]. So when I go and I meet fans, I see that they actually see me as a flesh-and-blood human being. That—as contrived as it may sound—changed [me] completely, assigning humanity to my life". At the tour's end, Swift channeled this positive energy into the making of ''Lover''.<ref name="EWMay" />

Swift described ''Lover'' as a [[Romance (love)|romantic]] one, stating that it was "not just simply thematically, like it's all [[love song]]s or something. The idea of something being romantic, it doesn't have to be a happy song. You can find romance in loneliness or sadness or going through things in your life... it just looks at those things through a romantic gaze".<ref name="release" /> In a ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' interview published in August 2019, Swift described the album as a "[[love letter]] to love, in all of its maddening, passionate, exciting, enchanting, horrific, tragic, wonderful glory".<ref name="Vogue">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-cover-september-2019|title=Taylor Swift on Sexism, Scrutiny, and Standing Up for Herself|first=Abby|last=Aguirre|magazine=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=August 8, 2019|access-date=August 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190810081937/https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-cover-september-2019?verso=true|archive-date=August 10, 2019}}</ref> On August 23, Swift described the album as "a celebration of love, in all its complexity, coziness, and chaos".<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B1fgxY-DsvJ/|title=Taylor Swift on Instagram|date=August 23, 2019|website=Instagram|access-date=March 25, 2020}}</ref> In an [[Instagram]] post dated September 17, 2019, Swift defined ''Lover'' as an album that feels like "fields, sunsets, + SUMMER".<ref name="IG2019-09-172">{{Cite web|date=September 17, 2019|title=Taylor Swift on Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B2hAIecjv5J/|access-date=March 8, 2020|website=Instagram}}</ref> In an interview with [[Zane Lowe]] for [[Beats 1]] on October 30, 2019, Swift said she considered ''Lover'' a return to "singing about my life in the way I actually experience it", unlike "through a filter of extremes" as is the case with ''Reputation''. She added the album was the first time she wrote about "love that was very real", compared to earlier songs such as "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]" (2008).<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Aniftos|first=Rania|date=October 30, 2019|title=Taylor Swift Compares 'Lover' to 'Reputation', Talks #MeToo Movement With Zane Lowe For Beats 1 Interview|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8541404/taylor-swift-zane-lowe-beats-1-interview|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=November 14, 2019}}</ref> Swift told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' that, compared to the "theatricality" of ''Reputation'' where she "said everything [she] needed to say", ''Lover'' turned out to be the album where she was no longer "answering to something".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Chiu|first=Melody|date=December 4, 2019|title=Inside Taylor Swift's Life-Changing Year: 'I'm Proud of the Things I've Withstood'|url=https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-people-of-the-year-life-changing-year/|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref> She explained to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', that the true distinction between the two albums is the delivery: "This time around I feel more comfortable being brave enough to be vulnerable, because my fans are brave enough to be vulnerable with me. Once people delve into the album [''Lover''], it'll become pretty clear that that's more of the fingerprint of this – that it's much more of a singer-songwriter, personal journey than the last one [''Reputation'']".<ref name="EWMay" />

=== Title ===

While promoting the album in a YouTube livestream on August 22, Swift revealed that the album was originally titled ''Daylight'' before she wrote the song "[[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|Lover]]" which changed her mind; she stated: "I decide an album title based on something that has a nice theme to it and a ring; it's very [[mood board]] how I go about [it]. The only time I ever started with a title was ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]''. That was the only time I started an album with a title so I began writing songs around that word. For this album, I actually thought the title of this album was going to be ''Daylight'' for a couple months. Then I wrote 'Lover' and I was like 'That's the title'".<ref name="YouTube Livestream22">{{cite magazine|last=Bailey|first=Alyssa|date=August 22, 2019|title=What Taylor Swift Revealed During Her YouTube Live: Her Lover Song Meanings, Old Diary Entries, and More|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28789479/taylor-swift-lover-youtube-live-recap/|magazine=Elle|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823085153/https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28789479/taylor-swift-lover-youtube-live-recap/|archive-date=August 23, 2019|access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> In the voice memos for Lover, which are found on the deluxe editions of the album, Swift further explained that after she wrote the song, she knew it would be the title and that it would "depict the tone for the record, and it's been a real catalyst for what this album has become."

=== Writing and production ===
Swift wrote ''Lover'' from an "open, free, romantic, whimsical place"; she added that the album felt "aesthetically very daytime", whereas its predecessor ''Reputation'' (2017) was "all [[cityscape]], darkness, full [[Swamp Witch]]".<ref name=":110">{{Cite web|last=Huff|first=Lauren|date=August 22, 2019|title=Taylor Swift talks all things 'Lover,' reveals album's original title|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/08/22/taylor-swift-lover-livestream-details-original-album-title/|access-date=March 22, 2020|website=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> Swift stated that she tried "not to go into making an album with any expectation"; she started to "write so much" that she "knew immediately it [''Lover''] would probably be bigger" than her other studio albums.<ref name="EWMay"/> Swift was the sole writer of three tracks—"[[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|Lover]]", "Cornelia Street" and "Daylight"; the rest were co-written with the producers. She co-produced every song and served as the sole executive producer of the album. Swift also highlighted that every song on ''Lover'' were written specifically for the album, devoid of leftovers from other albums; citing "This Love" as an example, which she had written closer to ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012), but ended up being on ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014). Her percussion credits for the track "Paper Rings" made ''Lover'' her first album since ''1989'' that she actively participated in instrumental recordings.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dominick|first=Nora|date=August 26, 2019|title=Here Are 19 Behind-The-Scenes Facts About Taylor Swift's "Lover"|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/noradominick/taylor-swift-lover-behind-the-scenes-facts|access-date=June 8, 2020|website=[[BuzzFeed]]|language=en}}</ref> [[File:Antonoff in Tucson (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Jack Antonoff]], Swift's frequent collaborator since 2013, co-produced the majority of ''Lover''.|alt=Man performing with a guitar|right|261x261px]]
Swift produced ''Lover'' with frequent collaborator [[Jack Antonoff]], as well as first-time collaborators [[Joel Little]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]], and [[Sounwave]].<ref name="LinerNotes" /> Swift and Antonoff first worked together on the song "[[Sweeter than Fiction]]" for the 2013 film ''[[One Chance (film)|One Chance]]''; Antonoff went on to write and produce on two of Swift's albums—''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017), as well as the song "[[I Don't Wanna Live Forever]]" for the 2017 film ''[[Fifty Shades Darker (film)|Fifty Shades Darker]]''. Antonoff co-wrote eight and co-produced eleven songs in the album. Little, known for being the lead singer of the punk band [[Goodnight Nurse]] and for his work with [[Lorde]], co-wrote and co-produced four songs, including the singles "[[Me!]]" and "[[You Need to Calm Down]]". Bell and Dukes, who worked with artists including [[Camila Cabello]] and [[Post Malone]], co-wrote and co-produced three songs. Swift co-produced tracks with Bell, Dukes, and Little from November to December 2018. Meanwhile, Swift worked with Antonoff on the album from January to February 2019. Sounwave has co-writing and co-producing credits on the song "London Boy"; other artists with writing credits include [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]], [[Cautious Clay]], and [[Brendon Urie]].

{{Quote|quote= I was sitting up at the piano up in my loft, and I had the chorus. It just kind of happened immediately.

"Lover", the title track, was written by Swift on piano, late at night at her home in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; Swift messaged a voice memo of the song to Antonoff. The next day, Swift flew to New York City to work on the song with Antonoff and recording engineer Laura Sisk, at the Electric Lady Studios. Swift played the song on the piano for them; herself and Antonoff produced the final version of the song during a six-hour recording session, using a "space echo" [[reverberation]] effect, a [[Paul McCartney]]-inspired [[bassline]], a "washy" piano, a "dream sequence wedding" [[mellotron]], a [[12 string]], live drums and a "[[Snare drum|snare]] hit really hard with a brush".<ref>{{cite news|last=Coscarelli|first=Joe|date=December 24, 2019|title=How Taylor Swift Writes a Love Song|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/arts/music/taylor-swift-lover.html|access-date=May 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Jack Antonoff Says Taylor Swift 'Wrote Every Stitch' of New Song 'Lover' Before He Joined Her in the Studio|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8527674/jack-antonoff-taylor-swift-lover-tweets|date=August 17, 2019|website=Billboard|access-date=May 21, 2020}}</ref>

|quote=''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' was so far from what I usually do. And ''Lover'' feels like a return to the fundamental songwriting pillars that I usually build my house on. It's really honest; it's not me playing a character. It's really just how I feel, undistilled. And there are a lot of very personal admissions in it. And also, I love a [[metaphor]]. I love building on the metaphor for a very long time. You know, the whole of ''Reputation'' was just a metaphor, but this [''Lover''] is a very personal record. So that's been really fun.

''[[The A.V.

The highly detailed lyrics have been found reminiscent to that of Swift's old-school work, where characters had novelistic aspects,<ref name=":13"/> especially the personal lyricism of ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010)<ref name=":15"/> and the confessional songwriting of ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012).<ref name="TheObserverreview"/> Deborah Krieger of ''[[PopMatters]]'' observed that the songs on ''Lover'' largely stem from contentment and satisfaction "in the middle of a strong relationship", rather than chronicling its downfall, which she cited as the main difference between ''Lover'' and its predecessors like ''Speak Now'', ''Red'' and ''1989.''<ref>{{Cite web|last=Krieger|first=Deborah|date=September 3, 2019|title=Taylor Swift's 'Lover' Finds Her in Romantic Bliss and at Peak Creativity|url=https://www.popmatters.com/taylor-swift-lover-review-2640081922.html|access-date=June 8, 2020|website=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref> In agreement, Larry Fitzmaurice saw Swift reaching a point of contentment in her art and self-perception In ''Lover''.<ref name="EWreview"/> The album has been found to be saturated in Swift's personal stories, packed with autobiographical details, emotional clarity and wisdom;<ref name=":14"/><ref name="telegraphreview"/><ref name="avclub"/><ref name="LATimesreview"/> ''Variety''<nowiki/>'s Chris Wilman highlighted "the minor war between past doubts and current happiness" which adds sophisticated layers to the lyrics.<ref name="Variety review"/> Critics further noticed how ''Lover'' provides glimpses into Swift's inner life using specific lyrics; Dana Schwartz of ''Time'' described it as "lifting a curtain to reveal the three-dimensional interiority behind two-dimensional paparazzi photos", while ''The A.V. Club''<nowiki/>'s Annie Zaleski thought that it delves into "love's day-to-day joys" that "drop just enough breadcrumb hints into reality to make songs more believable".<ref name=":15"/><ref name="avclub"/>

Open-hearted [[love song]]s dominate ''Lover,'' and examines all aspects of love. The songs consist of diaristic lyrics, emotional [[Bridge (music)|bridges]], ebullience, witty [[couplet]]s and turns of [[phrase]]; while also celebrating Swift's sense of humor, departing from the serious ''Reputation'' persona. As seen in "[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]", "[[Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince]]" and "[[You Need to Calm Down]]", the album incorporates politically charged lyrics, a previously less explored territory for Swift, while also embodying [[Americana (music)|Americana]]-inspired songwriting.<ref name=":15" /><ref name="NMEreview" /><ref name="telegraphreview" /><ref name=":16" /><ref name="Variety review" /> ''The Daily Telegraph'' attributed the "romantic zippiness" of "Paper Rings" and "I Think He Knows" to that of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals.<ref name="telegraphreview" /> Many songs on ''Lover'' continue Swift's self-assertive attitude and a sense of authority that has been observed in her preceding works.<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|title=The many sounds of Taylor Swift's new album "Lover"|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/culture/the-many-sounds-of-taylor-swifts-new-album-lover/article_fe34ae40-c7ad-11e9-9034-070a1eac9e9d.html|last=Schilz|first=Libby|date=August 26, 2019|website=[[The Daily Nebraskan]]|access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref> 

The album has also been theorized as a part of a trilogy. [[MTV]] opined that if''1989'' is Swift's "pop magnum opus, a high-pitched trumpeting into a newfound universe of freedom and independence", and ''Reputation'' "reflects the scorn felt when the reality of the world's cruelty drives her to distress", then ''Lover'' completes the [[trilogy]]—"a pastel-hued compromise between the good and the bad, not in spite of who she's been, but because of who she's been".<ref name="MTV" /> ''[[The Quietus]]'' argued ''Lover'' could be the finale to a ''Red'' and ''1989'' trilogy (considering ''Reputation'' as an odd standalone), or the first part to a new trilogy constituting Swift's future projects.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Thorpe-Tracey|first=CJ|date=September 3, 2019|title=Taylor Swift – Lover |url=https://thequietus.com/articles/27028-taylor-swift-lover-review|access-date=June 8, 2020|website=The Quietus|language=en-us}}</ref>

Detailing the emotional weight of the lyrics, Craig Jenkins of''[[Vulture magazine|Vulture]]'' called ''Lover'' a [[song cycle]] that celebrates the feeling of "meeting someone you'd happily spend the rest of your life with".<ref name=":13" /> Zaleski opined that ''Lover'' finds Swift in a confident headspace, with the knowledge she is not required to prove herself to anybody.<ref name="avclub" /> Moore broke down the album into three different parts: Swift and love, Swift and fame, Swift and her audience, with its 18 songs traversing "a hard road to the freedom that exists in surrendering to the best and worst this world has to offer" with peaceful grace.<ref name="MTV" /> ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' writer Rebecca Lewis outlined that all 18 tracks of ''Lover'' work together, with lyrics bouncing between happiness, anger, lust, infatuation and heartache, enabling a showcase of the "full spectrum of love".<ref name=":16" />

===Marketing===
Swift teased her seventh studio album through cryptic hint-dropping and "[[Easter egg (media)|easters eggs]]" on [[social media]]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, Swift "has perfected the [[pop culture]] feedback loop: She shares updates about her life and drops hints about new music, which fans then gobble up and re-promote with their own theories, which Swift then re-shares on her [[Tumblr]] or incorporates into future clues. It's like a T-Swift-built [[Penrose stairs|Escher staircase]] of personal memories and moments that tease what's next". Swift commented that she loves "that they [fans] like the cryptic hint-dropping. Because as long as they like it, I'll keep doing it. It's fun. It feels mischievous and playful". The magazine added that Swift "has designed the ultimate artistic [[scavenger hunt]] – and it's easy to get swept up in its drama, even if you don't listen to her music", and that she makes the audience "feel like they're on the journey with her".<ref name="EWMay" />

A few weeks before the expected release of ''Lover'', Swift invited a select group of fans to private listening parties called ''Secret Sessions'', to listen to the album, a tradition which began with ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' in 2014. These sessions were held in [[London]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1062021/secrets-revealed-from-taylor-swift-s-first-lover-secret-session|title=Secrets Revealed From Taylor Swift's First Lover Secret Session|first=McKenna|last=Aiello|date=August 2, 2019|website=E!

When talking about the second track on the album, ''Cruel Summer'', she said, "It deals with the idea of being in a relationship where there's some element of desperation and pain in it, where you're yearning for something that you don't quite have yet." When speaking on her song ''The Man'', she revealed, "I often think about what my career would have been like, and what my headlines about my career would have been like if I had been a man instead of a woman."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-25|title=Taylor Swift Shares Intimate Details of 'Lover' Songs During Secret Session {{!}} iHeartRadio|url=https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-08-23-taylor-swift-shares-intimate-details-of-lover-songs-during-secret-session/|access-date=2020-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825122533/https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-08-23-taylor-swift-shares-intimate-details-of-lover-songs-during-secret-session/|archive-date=August 25, 2019}}</ref>

Nora Princiotti of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' labelled ''Lover'' as "satisfying pop" that dips back into many of Swift's "creative wells", with songs that "snatch elements from all over her past", instead of "going for a clear, new sound like she did on her previous two albums"; she added that the result is a "dreamy record that makes good use of its stylistic freedom".<ref name="BostonGlobe"/> Nick Levine from ''[[NME]]'' considered ''Lover'' to be "more sprawling and further from flawless" than ''1989'' (2014), but it succeeds due to Swift's "frequently dazzling" melodies, and the "loved-up lyrics are ultimately quite touching."
