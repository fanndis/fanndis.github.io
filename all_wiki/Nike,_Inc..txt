Nike, originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), was founded by [[University of Oregon]] track athlete [[Phil Knight]] and his coach, [[Bill Bowerman]], on January 25, 1964.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-nike-facts-about-its-50th-anniversary-2014-11|title=11 Things Hardly Anyone Knows About Nike|last=O'Reilly|first=Lara|website=Business Insider|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref> The company initially operated in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], Oregon as a distributor for Japanese shoe maker [[Onitsuka Tiger]], making most sales at track meets out of Knight's automobile.<ref>O' Reilly, Lara (November 4, 2014).

According to [[Otis Davis]], a University of Oregon student athlete coached by Bowerman and Olympic gold medalist at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], his coach made the first pair of Nike shoes for him, contradicting a claim that they were made for Phil Knight. According to Davis, "I told [[Tom Brokaw]] that I was the first. I don't care what all the billionaires say. Bill Bowerman made the first pair of shoes for me. People don't believe me. In fact, I didn't like the way they felt on my feet. There was no support and they were too tight. But I saw Bowerman made them from the [[waffle iron]], and they were mine".<ref name=HudReporter2006>{{cite web|author=Hague, Jim|title=Truant officer was Olympic hero Emerson High has gold medalist in midst|newspaper=The Hudson Reporter|date=May 14, 2006|url=http://hudsonreporter.com/view/full_stories_home/2408547/article-Truant-officer-was-Olympic-hero-Emerson-High-has-gold-medallist-in-midst?|access-date=March 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504210729/http://hudsonreporter.com/view/full_stories_home/2408547/article-Truant-officer-was-Olympic-hero-Emerson-High-has-gold-medallist-in-midst|archive-date=May 4, 2012|url-status=dead |author-link=Jim Hague}}</ref>

Nike produces a wide range of sports equipment. Their first products were track running shoes. They currently also make shoes, jerseys, shorts, [[Cleat (shoe)|cleats]], [[baselayers]], etc. for a wide range of sports, including track and field, baseball, [[ice hockey]], tennis, association football (soccer), [[lacrosse]], basketball, and [[cricket]]. [[Nike Air Max]] is a line of shoes first released by Nike, Inc. in 1987. Additional product lines were introduced later, such as Air Huarache, which debuted in 1992. The most recent additions to their line are the Nike 6.0, Nike NYX, and [[Nike SB]] shoes, designed for [[skateboarding]].  Nike has recently introduced cricket shoes called Air Zoom Yorker, designed to be 30% lighter than their competitors'.<ref>{{cite web | title = Nike launches cricket shoe Air Zoom Yorker | publisher = The Hindu Business Line | date = September 2, 2006 | url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2006/09/02/stories/2006090203260500.htm | access-date = June 2, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110811035656/http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2006/09/02/stories/2006090203260500.htm | archive-date = August 11, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>  In 2008, Nike introduced the Air Jordan XX3, a high-performance basketball shoe designed with the environment in mind.

Nike sells an assortment of products, including shoes and apparel for sports activities like association football,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerpro.com/Nike-Air-Zoom-Control-II-FS-Indoor-Soccer-Shoes-c439/ |title=Nike Air Zoom Control II FS Futsal Shoes at Soccer Pro |publisher=Soccerpro.com |access-date=March 4, 2010}}</ref> basketball, running, [[combat sports]], tennis, [[American football]], athletics, golf, and [[cross training]] for men, women, and children. Nike also sells shoes for outdoor activities such as tennis, golf, [[skateboarding]], association football, baseball, [[American football]], cycling, volleyball, [[wrestling]], [[cheerleading]], aquatic activities, auto racing, and other athletic and recreational uses.  Nike recently teamed up with [[Apple Inc.]] to produce the [[Nike+iPod|Nike+]] product that monitors a runner's performance via a radio device in the shoe that links to the [[iPod nano]].  While the product generates useful statistics, it has been criticized by researchers who were able to identify users' [[RFID]] devices from {{convert|60|ft|m}} away using small, concealable intelligence [[Crossbow Technology|motes]]<!--- intended reference is Intel Mote iMote2---> in a [[wireless sensor network]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/systems/nikeipod/tracker-paper.pdf |title=Devices That Tell On You: The Nike+iPod Sport Kit |author1=T.

=== Collectibles ===
On July 23, 2019 a pair of Nike Inc. running shoes sold for $437,500 at a [[Sotheby's]] auction. The so-called "Moon Shoes" were designed by Nike co-founder and track coach Bill Bowerman for runners participating in the 1972 Olympics trials. The buyer was [[MDC Partners|Miles Nadal]], a Canadian investor and car collector, who had just paid $850,000 for a group of 99 rare of limited collection pairs of sport shoes.  The purchase price was the highest for one pair of sneakers, the previous record being $190,373 in 2017 for a pair of signed [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] shoes in [[California]], said to have been worn by [[Michael Jordan]] during the 1984 basketball final of the Olympics that year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-auction-sneakers-idUSKCN1UI2KM|title=Nike shoes race to $437,500 world record auction price for sneakers|date=July 24, 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=October 3, 2019|language=en}}</ref>

==Headquarters==<!-- This section is linked from [[Unincorporated area]] -->
Nike's world headquarters are surrounded by the city of Beaverton but are within [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]]. The city attempted to forcibly annex Nike's headquarters, which led to a lawsuit by Nike, and [[lobbying]] by the company that ultimately ended in Oregon Senate Bill 887 of 2005. Under that bill's terms, Beaverton is specifically barred from forcibly annexing the land that Nike and [[Columbia Sportswear]] occupy in Washington County for 35 years, while [[Electro Scientific Industries]] and [[Tektronix]] receive the same protection for 30 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/oregonianextra/2006/06/appellate_court_rejects_beaver.html |title=Appellate court rejects Beaverton annexation &#124; The Oregonian Extra |publisher=Blog.oregonlive.com |date=June 16, 2006 |access-date=March 4, 2010}}</ref> Nike is planning to build a 3.2 million square foot expansion to its World Headquarters in Beaverton.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news | title =A first look at Nike's $380M-plus HQ expansion (Renderings) | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/threads_and_laces/2016/01/nike-releases-first-images-of-expanded-washington.html | first=Erik | last=Siemers | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=January 20, 2016}}</ref> The design will target LEED Platinum certification and will be highlighted by natural daylight, and a gray water treatment center.<ref name=":0" />

Nike has contracted with more than 700 shops around the world and has offices located in 45 countries outside the United States.<ref>[http://www.nike.com/nikebiz/investors/reporting_sec/ar_99/corporate.html NikeBiz | Investors | Corporate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090302/http://www.nike.com/nikebiz/investors/reporting_sec/ar_99/corporate.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> Most of the factories are located in Asia, including Indonesia, China, Taiwan, India,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-indias-50-most-trusted-brands/20110120.htm |title=India's 50 most trusted brands |publisher=rediff.com |date=January 20, 2011}}</ref> Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, Philippines, and Malaysia.<ref>[http://www.nike.com/nikebiz/gc/mp/pdf/disclosure_list_2005-06.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620125833/http://www.nike.com/nikebiz/gc/mp/pdf/disclosure_list_2005-06.pdf|date=June 20, 2007}}</ref> Nike is hesitant to disclose information about the contract companies it works with.  However, due to harsh criticism from some organizations like [[CorpWatch]], Nike has disclosed information about its contract factories in its Corporate Governance Report.

===Sweatshops===
{{main|Nike sweatshops}}
In 1990s, Nike has received unending criticism<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nike is facing a new wave of anti-sweatshop protests - Business & Human Rights Resource Centre|url=https://www.business-humanrights.org/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=www.business-humanrights.org|language=en}}</ref> for its use of sweatshops. Later on that year, many protests occurred in big cities such as in Washington, DC and Boston in order to show public outcry for Nikes use of child labor and sweatshops. Nike has been criticized for contracting with factories (known as [[Nike sweatshops]]) in countries such as [[Labor relations in China|China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Mexico]]. Vietnam Labor Watch, an activist group, has documented that factories contracted by Nike have [[Wage theft|violated]] [[minimum wage]] and overtime [[laws in Vietnam]] as late as 1996, although Nike claims that this practice has been stopped.<ref>[http://www.saigon.com/nike/reports/report1.html Nike Labor Practices in Vietnam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010418214242/http://www.saigon.com/nike/reports/report1.html |date=April 18, 2001 }}</ref>  The company has been subject to much critical coverage of the often poor working conditions and [[exploitation of labor|exploitation]] of cheap overseas labor employed in the [[free trade zone]]s where their goods are typically manufactured.  Sources for this criticism include [[Naomi Klein]]'s book ''[[No Logo]]'' and [[Michael Moore]] documentaries.

Campaigns have been taken up by many colleges and universities, especially [[anti-globalisation]] groups, as well as several [[anti-sweatshop movement|anti-sweatshop groups]] such as the United Students Against Sweatshops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentsagainstsweatshops.org//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=45&Itemid=27 |title=Sweatfree Campus Campaign Launch |publisher=Studentsagainstsweatshops.org |date=September 28, 2005 |access-date=September 18, 2010}}</ref>

As of July 2011, Nike stated that two-thirds of its factories producing Converse products still do not meet the company's standards for worker treatment. A July 2011 [[Associated Press]] article stated that employees at the company's plants in [[Indonesia]] reported constant abuse from supervisors.<ref>[[Associated Press]], "Nike still dogged by worker abuses", ''[[Japan Times]]'', July 15, 2011, p. 4.</ref>

===Child labor allegations===
During the 1990s, Nike faced criticism for the use of [[child labor]] in [[Child labour in Cambodia|Cambodia]] and [[Child labour in Pakistan|Pakistan]] in factories it contracted to manufacture soccer balls. Although Nike took action to curb or at least reduce the practice, they continue to contract their production to companies that operate in areas where inadequate regulation and monitoring make it hard to ensure that child labor is not being used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/ipc/publications/pdf/02-007.pdf |title=MIT |access-date=September 18, 2010}}</ref>

In 2001, a BBC documentary uncovered occurrences of child labor and poor working conditions in a Cambodian factory used by Nike.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sun Thyda, 12 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/970385.stm |title=Programmes &#124; Panorama &#124; Archive &#124; Gap and Nike: No Sweat? October 15, 2000 |publisher=BBC News  |date=October 15, 2000 |access-date=March 4, 2010}}</ref> The documentary focused on six girls, who all worked seven days a week, often 16 hours a day.

===Strike in China factory===
In April 2014, one of the biggest strikes in mainland China took place at the [[Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings]] [[Dongguan]] shoe factory, producing amongst others for Nike. Yue Yuen did underpay an employee by 250 yuan (40.82 US Dollars) per month. The average salary at Yue Yuen is 3000 yuan per month. The factory employs 70,000 people. This practice was in place for nearly 20 years.<ref>[http://www.clb.org.hk/en/content/more-ten-thousand-workers-stage-strike-massive-dongguan-shoe-factory More than ten thousand workers stage strike at massive Dongguan shoe factory], April 14, 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1483287/yue-yuen-shoe-factory-workers-strike-dongguan-plants-continues Yue Yuen shoe factory workers' strike at Dongguan plants continues], April 17, 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1486399/yue-yuen-strikers-vow-continue-until-benefit-contribution-deficit-paid Yue Yuen strikers vow to continue until benefit contribution deficit paid in full], South China Morning Post, April 18, 2013.</ref>

===Paradise Papers===
{{Main|Paradise Papers}}
On November 5, 2017, the [[Paradise Papers]], a set of confidential [[electronic document]]s relating to [[offshore investment]], revealed that Nike is among the corporations that used [[Offshore company|offshore companies]] to avoid taxes.<ref>"[http://www.dw.com/en/paradise-papers-expose-tax-evasion-schemes-of-the-global-elite/a-41246087 'Paradise papers' expose tax evasion schemes of the global elite]".

[[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]] documents detail how Nike boosted its after-tax profits by, among other maneuvers, transferring ownership of its Swoosh trademark to a Bermudan subsidiary, Nike International Ltd. This transfer allowed the subsidiary to charge royalties to its European headquarters in [[Hilversum]], [[Netherlands]], effectively converting taxable company [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s to an account payable in [[Tax haven|tax-free]] [[Bermuda]].<ref name=Nike>{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|title=How NikeStays One Step Ahead of the Regulators: When One Tax Loophole Closes, Another Opens|author=Simon Bowers|publisher=ICIJ|date=November 6, 2017|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref> Although the subsidiary was effectively run by executives at Nike's main offices in [[Beaverton, Oregon]]—to the point where a duplicate of the Bermudan company's seal was needed—for tax purposes the subsidiary was treated as Bermuda. Its profits were not declared in Europe and came to light only because of a mostly unrelated case in US Tax Court, where papers filed by Nike briefly mention royalties in 2010, 2011 and 2012 totaling $3.86 billion.<ref name=Nike/> Under an arrangement with Dutch authorities, the tax break was to expire in 2014, so another reorganization transferred the intellectual property from the Bermudan company to a Dutch ''commanditaire vennootschap'' or limited partnership, Nike Innovate CV. Dutch law treats income earned by a CV as if it had been earned by the principals, who owe no tax in the Netherlands if they do not reside there.<ref name=Nike/>

===Colin Kaepernick===
In September 2018, Nike announced it had signed former American football quarterback [[Colin Kaepernick]], noted for his [[U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)|controversial decision to kneel]] during the playing of the US national anthem, to a long-term advertising campaign.<ref>{{cite web | last = Einhorn | first = Bruce | title = Nike Falls as Critics Fume on Social Media Over Kaepernick Deal | publisher = Bloomberg | date = September 4, 2018 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/nike-decides-a-colin-kaepernick-deal-is-worth-the-backlash}}</ref> According to Charles Robinson of [[Yahoo Sports|Yahoo! Sports]], Kaepernick and Nike agreed to a new contract despite the fact Kaepernick has been with the company since 2011 and said that "interest from other shoe companies" played a part in the new agreement. Robinson said the contract is a "wide endorsement" where Kaepernick will have his own branded line including shoes, shirts, jerseys and more. According to Robinson, Kaepernick signed a "star" contract that puts him level with a "top-end NFL player" worth millions per year plus royalties.<ref>{{cite web | last = Daniels | first = Tim | title = Colin Kaepernick Named Face of Nike's 30th Anniversary of 'Just Do It' Campaign | publisher = Bleacher Report | date = September 3, 2018 | url = https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2793994-colin-kaepernick-named-face-of-nikes-30th-anniversary-of-just-do-it-campaign}}</ref> In response, some people set fire to their own Nike-branded clothes and shoes or cut the Nike swoosh logo out of their clothes, and the [[Fraternal Order of Police]] called the advertisement an "insult";<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquire.com/style/mens-fashion/a22969808/colin-kaepernick-nike-ad-burning-sneakers-response/|title=People Are Already Burning Their Nikes in Response to the Colin Kaepernick Ad|date=September 4, 2018|work=Esquire|access-date=September 5, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/nike-advert-with-colin-kaepernick-has-people-burning-products-2018-9|title=People are destroying their Nike shoes and socks to protest Nike's Colin Kaepernick ad campaign|website=Business Insider France|language=fr-FR|access-date=September 5, 2018}}</ref><ref name="vibe" /> others, such as [[LeBron James]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cancian |first1=Dan |title=LeBron 'Stands with Nike' in Support of Colin Kaepernick's Campaign |url=https://www.newsweek.com/lebron-stands-nike-support-colin-kaepernicks-campaign-1108699 |website=Newsweek |access-date=September 7, 2018|date=September 6, 2018 }}</ref> [[Serena Williams]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Serena Williams supports Nike's decision to endorse Colin Kaepernick |url=https://globalnews.ca/video/4427989/serena-williams-supports-nikes-decision-to-endorse-colin-kaepernick |website=Global News |access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref> and the [[National Black Police Association (United States)|National Black Police Association]],<ref name="vibe">{{cite web |last1=Golding |first1=Shenequa |title=The National Black Police Association Is In Full Support Of Nike's Colin Kaepernick Ad |url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/09/national-association-of-black-police-support-nike-colin-kaepernick/ |website=Vibe |date=September 6, 2018 |access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref> praised Nike for its campaign.

=== Nike Vaporfly Shoe ===
{{Main|Nike Vaporfly and Tokyo 2020 Olympics Controversy}}
On January 31, 2020, the [[World Athletics]] issued new guidelines concerning shoes to be used in the upcoming [[2020 Summer Olympics|Tokyo 2020 Olympics]].<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldathletics.org/news/press-releases/modified-rules-shoes|title=World Athletics modifies rules governing competition shoes for elite athletes |website=www.worldathletics.org|language=en|access-date=March 26, 2020}}</ref> These updates came in response to criticisms concerning technology in the Nike Vaporfly running shoes, which had been submitted beginning around 2017–2018.<ref name=":2">{{Citation|title=The Race for Brands to Match Nike's Vaporfly|url=https://www.wsj.com/video/the-race-for-brands-to-match-nikes-vaporfly/2FBD7367-FE45-4879-851A-ABED237F7987.html|language=en-US|access-date=March 26, 2020}}</ref> These criticisms stated that the shoes provided athletes with an unfair advantage over their opponents and some critics considered it to be a form of [[mechanical doping]].<ref name=":03"/><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/02/23/808681604/nike-vaporfly-shoes-controversy|title=Nike Vaporfly Shoes Controversy|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=March 26, 2020}}</ref> According to Nike funded research, the shoes can improve efficiency by up to 4.2%<ref name=":03" /> and runners who have tested the shoe are saying that it causes reduced soreness in the legs; sports technologist Bryce Dyer attributes this to the ZoomX and carbon fiber plate since it absorbs the energy and "spring[s] runners forward".<ref name=":3" /> Some athletes, scientists, and fans have compared this to the 2008 [[LZR Racer|LAZR swimsuit controversy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/02/09/nikes-vaporfly-shoes-changed-running-track-field-world-is-still-sifting-through-fallout/|title=Nike's Vaporfly shoes changed running, and the track and field world is still sifting through the fallout |first=Adam |last=Kilgore |website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=March 26, 2020}}</ref>

Some of the major changes in the guidelines that have come about as a result of these criticisms include that the "sole must be no thicker than 40mm" and that "the shoe must not contain more than one rigid embedded plate or blade (of any material) that runs either the full length or only part of the length of the shoe. The plate may be in more than one part but those parts must be located sequentially in one plane (not stacked or in parallel) and must not overlap". The components of the shoes are not the only thing that had major changes; starting April 30, 2020, "any shoe must have been available for purchase by any athlete on the open retail market (online or in store) for a period of four months before it can be used in competition".<ref name=":12" /> Prior to these new guidelines World Athletics reviewed the Vaporfly shoes and "concluded that there is independent research that indicates that the new technology incorporated in the soles of road and spiked shoes may provide a performance advantage" and that it recommends further research to "establish the true impact of [the Vaporfly] technology."<ref name=":12" />

==Environmental record==
In 2007, [[New England]]-based environmental organization Clean Air-Cool Planet ranked Nike among the top three companies (out of 56) in a survey of climate-friendly companies.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zabarenko |first=Deborah |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSN1840883720070619?feedType=RSS |title=Reuters report |agency=Reuters  |date= June 19, 2007|access-date=September 18, 2010}}</ref> Nike has also been praised for its [[Nike Grind]] program, which closes the [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|product lifecycle]], by groups such as [[Climate Counts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://climatecounts.org/scorecompany.php?co=43 |title=Nike |publisher=ClimateCounts |access-date=September 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212032423/http://climatecounts.org/scorecompany.php?co=43 |archive-date=February 12, 2011 }}</ref>

A campaign that Nike began for Earth Day 2008 was a commercial that featured basketball star [[Steve Nash]] wearing Nike's Trash Talk Shoe, which had been constructed in February 2008 from pieces of leather and synthetic leather waste from factory floors. The Trash Talk Shoe also featured a sole composed of ground-up rubber from a shoe recycling program. Nike claims this is the first performance basketball shoe that has been created from manufacturing waste, but it only produced 5,000 pairs for sale.<ref>[http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003793129&imw=Y] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505070832/http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003793129 |date=May 5, 2008 }} <!-- April 23, 2008.

A project through the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] found workers were exposed to toxic [[isocyanate]]s and other chemicals in footwear factories in [[Thailand]].

==Marketing strategy==
Nike promotes its products through [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship agreements]] with celebrity athletes, professional teams and college athletic teams.

===Advertising===
In 1982, Nike aired its first three national television ads, created by newly formed ad agency [[Wieden+Kennedy]] (W+K), during the broadcast of the [[New York Marathon]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nudd|first1=Tim|title=W+K Finds Its First Ads Ever, for Nike, on Dusty Old Tapes|url=http://www.adweek.com/creativity/wieden-kennedy-finds-its-first-ads-ever-made-nike-dusty-old-tapes-156511/|website=Adweek|access-date=April 9, 2017}}</ref> The Cannes Advertising Festival has named Nike its Advertiser of the Year in 1994 and 2003, making it the first company to receive that honor twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/4121690-1.html |title=Nike's Knight Is Advertiser of the Year |publisher=AllBusiness.com |access-date=March 4, 2010}}</ref>

Nike also has earned the [[Emmy Award]] for best commercial in 2000 and 2002. The first was for "The Morning After," a satirical look at what a runner might face on the morning of January 1, 2000, if every dire prediction about the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K problem]] came to fruition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fass |first=Allison |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEFDA1430F932A0575BC0A9669C8B63 |title=The Media Business – Advertising – Addenda – Nike Spot Wins An Emmy Award |work=New York Times |date=August 31, 2000 |access-date=March 4, 2010}}</ref> The second was for a 2002 spot called "Move," which featured a series of famous and everyday athletes in a variety of athletic pursuits.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rutenberg |first=Jim |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E6D61130F933A1575AC0A9649C8B63&n=Top%2FNews%2FBusiness%2FCompanies%2FNike%20Inc |title=Nike Spot Wins An Emmy Award |work=The New York Times |date=September 20, 2002 |access-date=March 4, 2010}}</ref>

====Beatles song====
Nike was criticized for its use of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]" in a 1987 commercial against the wishes of [[Apple Records]], the Beatles' recording company. Nike paid US$250,000 to [[Capitol Records]] Inc., which held the North American licensing rights to the recordings, for the right to use the Beatles' rendition for a year.<ref name=":5" /> 

That same year, Apple Records sued Nike Inc., Capitol Records Inc., [[EMI|EMI Records]] Inc. and Wieden+Kennedy for $15&nbsp;million.<ref name=":5">According to a July 28, 1987 article written by the [[Associated Press]].</ref>  Capitol-EMI countered by saying the lawsuit was "groundless" because Capitol had licensed the use of "Revolution" with the "active support and encouragement of [[Yoko Ono]], a shareholder and director of Apple Records."

Nike discontinued airing ads featuring "Revolution" in March 1988. Yoko Ono later gave permission to Nike to use [[John Lennon]]'s "Instant Karma" in another advertisement.

====New media marketing====
Nike was an early adopter of [[internet marketing]], [[email management]] technologies, and using [[broadcast]] and [[narrowcasting|narrowcast]] communication technologies to create multimedia marketing campaigns.

====Minor Threat advertisement====
In late June 2005, Nike received criticism from [[Ian MacKaye]], owner of [[Dischord Records]], guitarist/vocalist for [[Fugazi]] and [[The Evens]], and front man of the defunct punk band [[Minor Threat]], for appropriating imagery and text from Minor Threat's [[First Two 7"s on a 12"|1981 self-titled album]]'s cover art in a flyer promoting [[Nike Skateboarding]]'s 2005 East Coast demo tour.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Levine|first=Robert|date=July 4, 2005|title=A Nike Poster Upsets Fans of the Punk Rock Band Minor Threat in a Major Way|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/04/business/media/a-nike-poster-upsets-fans-of-the-punk-rock-band-minor-threat.html|access-date=August 31, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> {{Clear}}
On June 27, Nike Skateboarding's website issued an apology to Dischord, Minor Threat, and fans of both and announced that they have tried to remove and dispose of all flyers. They stated that the people who designed it were skateboarders and Minor Threat fans themselves who created the advertisement out of respect and appreciation for the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nike.com/nikeskateboarding/v2/letter/index.html |title=Skateboarding |publisher=Nike |access-date=September 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125082327/http://www.nike.com/nikeskateboarding/v2/letter/index.html |archive-date=November 25, 2010 }}</ref>  The dispute was eventually settled out of court between Nike and Minor Threat.

====Nike 6.0====
As part of the 6.0 campaign, Nike introduced a new line of T-shirts that include phrases such as "Dope", "Get High" and "Ride Pipe" – sports lingo that is also a [[double entendre]] for [[Recreational drug use|drug use]]. Boston Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] expressed his objection to the shirts after seeing them in a window display at the city's Niketown and asked the store to remove the display. "What we don't need is a major corporation like Nike, which tries to appeal to the younger generation, out there giving credence to the drug issue," Menino told ''[[The Boston Herald]]''. A company official stated the shirts were meant to pay homage to extreme sports, and that Nike does not condone the illegal use of drugs.<ref>{{cite news | first = Allan | last = Brettman | title = Nike courts controversy, publicity with drug-themed skater shirts | newspaper=The Oregonian | date = June 22, 2011 | url = http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2011/06/nike_courts_controversy_public.html | access-date = June 24, 2011}}</ref> Nike was forced to replace the shirt line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stocksandshares.tv/nike-inc-nysenke-facing-slogan-backlash/3209121 |title=Nike Inc.

Nike sponsors top athletes in many sports to use their products and [[promotion (marketing)|promote]] and advertise their technology and design. Nike's first professional athlete endorser was Romanian tennis player [[Ilie Năstase]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/lifestyle/history-of-nike-15057083|title=History of Nike: Timeline and Facts|website=[[TheStreet.com]]|author=Meyer, Jack|date=August 14, 2019|access-date=September 20, 2019}}</ref> The first track endorser was distance runner [[Steve Prefontaine]]. Prefontaine was the prized pupil of the company's co-founder, [[Bill Bowerman]], while he coached at the University of Oregon. Today, the Steve Prefontaine Building is named in his honor at Nike's corporate headquarters. Nike has only made one statue of its sponsored athletes and it is of Steve Prefontaine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0WMzYGhCgw|title=Fire on the Track - The Steve Prefontaine Story - Part 1|website=YouTube|language=en-US|access-date=June 4, 2019}}</ref>
