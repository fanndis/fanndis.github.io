==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words. As of July 4, 2020, the word count for this plot summary is 693 words. -->
Mookie is a 25-year-old pizza delivery man living in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant]], with his sister Jade. He and his girlfriend Tina have a toddler son named Hector. Mookie works at a local pizzeria owned by Sal, an [[Italian-American]] who has been in the neighborhood for 25 years. Sal's eldest son Pino is racist, and does not get along with Mookie. Because of this, Pino is at odds with both his father, who refuses to leave the [[African-American neighborhood|majority African-American]] neighborhood, and his younger brother Vito, who is friendly with Mookie.

Many distinctive residents are introduced, including Da Mayor, a friendly drunk; Mother Sister, who watches the neighborhood from her [[brownstone]]; Radio Raheem, who blasts [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] on his [[boombox]] wherever he goes; and Smiley, a [[mentally disabled]] man who meanders around the neighborhood trying to sell hand-colored pictures of [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]

While at Sal's, Mookie's friend Buggin' Out questions Sal about his "Wall of Fame", a wall decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. Buggin' Out demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal replies that it is his business, and that he can have whoever he wants on the wall. Buggin' Out attempts to start a boycott over the Wall of Fame.

During the day, local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the other neighbors to beat the heat wave before officers intervene. After a phone call, Mookie and Pino begin arguing over race. Mookie confronts Pino about his negative attitudes towards African Americans, although the latter's favorite celebrities are black. Various characters express racial insults: Mookie against Italians, Pino against African Americans, Latino Stevie against Koreans, white officer Gary Long against Puerto Ricans, and Korean  owner Sonny against Jews. Pino expresses his contempt for African Americans to Sal, but Sal insists that he will not leave the neighborhood.
 
That night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march into Sal's and demand that Sal change the Wall of Fame. Raheem's boombox is blaring and Sal demands that he turn it off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out calls Sal and sons "guinea bastards" and threatens to close down the pizzeria until they change the Wall of Fame. Frustrated and angry, Sal calls Buggin' Out a "[[nigger]]" and destroys Raheem's boombox with a baseball bat. Raheem attacks Sal, leading to a fight that spills out into the street and attracts a crowd. The police arrive, break up the fight, and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. Despite the pleas of onlookers, one officer refuses to release his chokehold on Raheem, killing him. Realizing that Raheem has been killed in front of witnesses, the officers place his body in the back of a [[squad car]] and drive off.

The onlookers, enraged about Radio Raheem's death, blame Sal and his sons. Da Mayor tries to convince the crowd that Sal was not responsible for his death but the crowd remain where they are. Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the window of Sal's pizzeria, sparking the crowd to rush into the store and destroy it. Smiley sets the building on fire, and Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito out of the mob's way. Firemen and riot patrols arrive to put out the fire and disperse the crowd. After they issue a warning, the firefighters turn their hoses on the rioters, leading to more fighting and arrests. Mookie and Jade sit on the curb, watching in disbelief. Smiley wanders back into the smoldering building and hangs one of his pictures on what is left of Sal's Wall of Fame.

The next day, after an argument with Tina, Mookie returns to Sal. He feels that Mookie had betrayed him, but Mookie demands his weekly pay. The two men argue and cautiously reconcile, and Sal finally pays Mookie. Mister Señor Love Daddy, a local DJ, dedicates a song to Radio Raheem.

The film ends with two quotations that express different views about violence, one by Martin Luther King and one by Malcolm X. It fades to a photograph of the two leaders shaking hands. Prior to the credits, Lee dedicates the film to the families of six victims of brutality or racial violence: [[Eleanor Bumpurs]], [[Michael Griffith (manslaughter victim)|Michael Griffith]], Arthur Miller Jr., [[Edmund Perry]], Yvonne Smallwood, and [[Death of Michael Stewart|Michael Stewart]].

==Production==
Lee first got the idea for the film after watching the ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' episode "Shopping for Death," in which the main characters discuss their theory that hot weather increases violent tendencies. He was also inspired by the 1986 [[Howard Beach racial incident]], in which an African-American man was killed; and also the [[shooting of Eleanor Bumpurs]] by police.<ref name=ew>{{cite news|last1=Staskiewicz|first1=Keith|title=Do the Right Thing: 1989|work=Entertainment Weekly|issue=1282/1283|date=October 25, 2013|page=42}}</ref> Lee wrote the screenplay in two weeks.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/fight-the-power-spike-lee-on-do-the-right-thing-20140620 |title= Fight the Power: Spike Lee on 'Do the Right Thing' |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |author= Gavin Edwards |date= 20 June 2014  |access-date= 29 April 2015}}</ref>

The original script of ''Do the Right Thing'' ended with a stronger reconciliation between Mookie and Sal than Lee used in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/do-the-right-thing-script.html |title='Do the Right Thing' Script (Archived) |publisher=Script-O-Rama |date=28 April 2007 |access-date=29 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428033003/http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/do-the-right-thing-script.html |archivedate=April 28, 2007 }}</ref> In this version, Sal's comments to Mookie are similar to Da Mayor's earlier comments in the film and hint at some common ground, and perhaps Sal's understanding of why Mookie tried to destroy his restaurant. Lee has not explicitly explained why he changed the ending but his contemporaneous notes compiled in the film's companion book indicate [[Lisa Jones]] expressed Sal's reaction as "too nice" as originally written.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WyMoc4YZKl8C&q=%22monty+and+lisa+jones%22&pg=PA72 |title=Lee, Spike; Jones, Lisa.

===Casting===
Lee campaigned for [[Robert De Niro]] to play Sal the pizzeria owner, but De Niro had to decline due to prior commitments. Aiello eventually played Sal and his son Rick played Gary Long, the police officer who kills Radio Raheem. The character of Smiley was not in the original script; he was created by [[Roger Guenveur Smith]], who was pestering Lee for a role in the film.<ref>Do The Right Thing DVD Audio Commentary</ref>

Four of the cast members were stand-up comedians: [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]], [[Steve White (actor)|Steve White]], and [[Robin Harris]]. Lee originally wanted Nunn to play the role of Mister Señor Love Daddy, but later recast him as Radio Raheem. The acting couple Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee were friends of Lee's father [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill]]; they were cast as Mother Sister and Da Mayor.<ref name=ew/> Perez was cast as Mookie's love interest Tina after Lee saw her dancing at a Los Angeles dance club. Perez decided to take the part because her sister lived four blocks from the set. She had never been in a film before and became upset during the filming of Radio Raheem's death scene.<ref name=ew/>

===Filming===
The film was shot entirely on Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the [[Bedford–Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]]. The street's color scheme was altered by the production designer, who used a great deal of red and orange paint to convey the sense of a heatwave. The Korean grocery store and Sal's pizzeria were built from scratch on two empty lots. The pizzeria was fully functional and the actors cooked pizzas in the ovens. During filming, the neighborhood's [[crack cocaine|crack]] dealers threatened the film crew for disturbing their business there. Lee hired [[Fruit of Islam]] members to provide security.<ref name=ew/> Jackson later revealed that he spent much of his time on set sleeping as he has no scenes outside.<ref name=ew/>

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 93%, based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 9.14/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Smart, vibrant and urgent without being didactic, ''Do the Right Thing'' is one of Spike Lee's most fully realized efforts – and one of the most important films of the 1980s."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/do_the_right_thing/ |title= Rotten Tomatoes 'Do the Right Thing' profile |website= Rotten Tomatoes |access-date= October 19, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 93 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "universal acclaim", and placing it as the 68th-highest film of all-time on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/do-the-right-thing |title= 'Do the Right Thing' Metacritic profile |website= Metacritic |access-date= 29 April 2015}}</ref>

Both [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] ranked the film as the best of 1989, and later each ranked it as one of the top 10 films of the decade ({{Numero|6}} for Siskel and {{Numero|4}} for Ebert).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjYS8EUakgs |title= Siskel & Ebert 1989-Best of 1989 (2of2) |publisher= [[YouTube]] |date= 17 December 2010 |access-date= 29 April 2015}}</ref> Siskel described the film as "a spiritual documentary that shows racial joy, hatred and confusion at every turn",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-06-30-8902130689-story.html|title=A Serious 'Right Thing' For a Frivolous Summer|first=Gene|last=Siskel|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=June 30, 1989|accessdate=October 19, 2020}}</ref> while Ebert lauded it for coming "closer to reflecting the current state of race relations in America than any other movie of our time."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/do-the-right-thing-1989|title=Do the Right Thing|first=Roger|last=Ebert|publisher=rogerebert.com|date=June 30, 1989|accessdate=October 19, 2020}}</ref> Ebert later added the film to his list of ''[[The Great Movies]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/great-movies/ |title= The Great Movies |author= Roger Ebert |publisher= rogerebert.com |access-date= 29 April 2015}}</ref> In a retrospective review in 2019, Kambole Campbell of the British magazine ''[[Little White Lies (magazine)|Little White Lies]]'' noted the film's lasting relevance and called it "a bold expression of love and frustration and care and anger that is so vivid and expressive it feels like it exists in the here and now."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwlies.com/reviews/do-the-right-thing-1989/|title=Do the Right Thing (1989)|first=Kabole|last=Campbell|publisher=[[Little White Lies (magazine)|Little White Lies]]|date=July 30, 2019|accessdate=October 19, 2020}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' film critic [[Wesley Morris]] has called ''Do the Right Thing'' his favorite film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/2019/8/27/20834497/do-the-right-thing-with-sean-fennessey-and-wesley-morris|title='Do The Right Thing' With Sean Fennessey and Wesley Morris|last=Fennessey|first=Sean|date=2019-08-27|website=The Ringer|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>

Some critics were less favorable in their reviews. [[Dave Kehr]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film two stars out of four; while calling the film "amiable", he resented it for employing [[white guilt]] and "seeing violence as a liberating symbol rather than a debasing reality."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-06-30-8902130690-story.html|title='Do the Right Thing' at Least Takes a Stab at Complexity|first=Dave|last=Kehr|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=June 30, 1989|accessdate=October 19, 2020}}</ref> Ralph Novak, writing for ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', panned the film as incoherent and having an unclear message and no likable characters: "If Lee is saying that racism is profoundly painful, frustrating and confusing, no one will argue. But this film states the case without offering any insight."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/picks-and-pans-review-do-the-right-thing-vol-32-no-1/|title=Picks and Pans Review: Do the Right Thing|first=Ralph|last=Novak|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=July 3, 1989|accessdate=October 19, 2020}}</ref>

According to online film resource ''They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?'', ''Do the Right Thing'' is the most acclaimed film of 1989.<ref>{{cite web | title = The 1,000 Greatest Films (Full List) | url = http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php | work = They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?}}</ref>

===Controversies===
After release, many reviewers protested its content. Some columnists opined that the film could incite black audiences to riot.<ref>Klein, Joe. "Spiked?" New York<!-- What paper? -->, June 26, 1989: 14–15.</ref> Lee criticized white reviewers in turn for suggesting that black audiences were incapable of restraining themselves while watching a fictional motion picture.<ref name="autogenerated1">"Spike Lee's Last Word", special feature on the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD (2000)</ref> In a 2014 interview, Lee said, "That still bugs the shit out of me," calling the remarks "outrageous, egregious and, I think, racist." He said, "I don't remember people saying people were going to come out of theaters killing people after they watched [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] films."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Gavin|title=Fight the Power: Spike Lee on 'Do the Right Thing'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/fight-the-power-spike-lee-on-do-the-right-thing-20140620|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=4 April 2017|date=June 20, 2014}}</ref>

An open question near the end of the film is whether Mookie "does the right thing" when he throws the garbage can through the window, inciting the riot that destroys Sal's pizzeria. Some critics have interpreted Mookie's action as one that saves Sal's life by redirecting the crowd's anger away from Sal to his property, while others say that it was an "irresponsible encouragement to enact violence".<ref name="Reid1997">{{cite book|author=Mark A. Reid|title=Spike Lee's Do the right thing|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521550765|url-access=registration|access-date=September 25, 2010|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55954-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521550765/page/43 43]–}}</ref> The quotations by two major black leaders used at the end the film provide no answers: one advocates nonviolence, the other advocates armed self-defense in response to oppression.<ref name="Reid1997" />

Spike Lee has remarked that only white viewers ask him if Mookie did the right thing; black viewers do not ask the question.<ref>''Do The Right Thing'' DVD, Director's commentary</ref> Lee believes the key point is that Mookie was angry at the wrongful death of Radio Raheem, stating that viewers who question the riot are explicitly failing to see the difference between damage to property and the death of a black man.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Lee has been criticized for his representation of women. For example, [[bell hooks]] said that he wrote black women in the same objectifying way that white male filmmakers write the characters of white women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=hooks|first=bell|date=2014-10-10|title=Black Looks|doi=10.4324/9781315743226|isbn=9781315743226}}</ref> Rosie Perez, who was in an acting role for the first time as Tina in ''Do the Right Thing'', said later that she was very uncomfortable with doing the nude scene in the film:

{{Quote
|text="My first experience [with doing nude scenes] was ''Do the Right Thing''. And I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was afraid of what my family would think — that’s what was really bothering me. It wasn’t really about taking off my clothes. But I also didn’t feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn’t correct. And when Spike Lee puts ice cubes on my nipples, the reason you don’t see my head is because I’m crying. I was like, I don’t want to do this."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/25/magazine/the-pressure-to-take-it-off.html|title=The Pressure To Take It Off|last=Udovitch|first=Mim|date=2000-06-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
