Bhumibol's U.S. birth certificate reads simply "'''Baby Songkla'''", as the parents had to consult his uncle, King [[Prajadhipok|Rama VII]] (Prajadhipok), then head of the House of Chakri, for an auspicious name. The king chose a name of [[Sanskrit]] origin, ''Bhumibol Adulyadej'' ([[Devanagari]]: भूमिबल अतुल्यतेज, <small>[[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]</small>: ''Bhūmibala Atulyateja''), a [[compound word#Sanskrit language|compound]] of ''Bhūmi'' ([[wikt:भूमि|भूमि]]), meaning "Land"; ''Bala'' ([[wikt:बल|बल]]), meaning "Strength" or "Power"; ''Atulya'' ([[wikt:अतुल्य|अतुल्य]]), meaning "Incomparable"; and ''Tej'' ([[wikt:तेज|तेज]]), meaning "Power". Thus, ''Bhūmibala Atulyateja'', or ''Bhumibol Adulyadej'' as it is transliterated in [[Thai language|Thai]], can be literally translated as "Strength of the Land, Incomparable Power".

==Early life==
[[File:Mom Sangwal and children.JPG|thumb|230px|Bhumibol (centre) with his mother and siblings Ananda Mahidol (left) and Galyani Vadhana (right)]]
[[File:King Bhumibol Adulyadej Portrait-1945.jpg|thumb|upright|Bhumibol in 1945]]
Bhumibol was born at [[Mount Auburn Hospital]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in the United States, on 5 December 1927.<ref name=Kanchanapisek /> He was the youngest son of Prince [[Mahidol Adulyadej]], the Prince of Songkla, and his commoner wife [[Thai royal and noble titles#Mom|Mom]] Sangwan (later Princess [[Srinagarindra]], the Princess Mother). His father was enrolled in the public health program at [[Harvard University]], which is why Bhumibol was the only monarch to be [[Accidental American|born in the US]].<ref name="Grossman-Faulder">{{cite book|last1=Grossman|first1=Nicholas|last2=Faulder|first2=Dominic|title=King Bhumibol Adulyadej – A Life's Work|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|isbn=978-9814260565|date=2012}}</ref>{{RP|46–47}} Bhumibol had an older sister, Princess [[Galyani Vadhana]], and an older brother, Prince [[Ananda Mahidol]].

Bhumibol came to Thailand in 1928, after his father obtained a certificate from Harvard. His father died of kidney failure in September 1929, when Bhumibol was less than two years old.<ref name="Grossman-Faulder" />{{RP|62}} He briefly attended [[Mater Dei School (Thailand)|Mater Dei school]] in [[Bangkok]], but in 1933 his mother took her family to Switzerland, where he continued his education at the [[École nouvelle de la Suisse romande]] in [[Lausanne]]. In 1934 Bhumibol was given his first camera, which ignited his lifelong enthusiasm for photography.<ref name="Grossman-Faulder" />{{RP|67}} When Bhumibol's childless uncle [[Prajadhipok]] abdicated in 1935, his nine-year-old brother [[Ananda Mahidol]] became King Rama VIII. However, the family remained in Switzerland and the affairs of the head of state were conducted by a [[regency]] council. They returned to Thailand for only two months in 1938. In 1942, Bhumibol became a jazz enthusiast, and started to play the saxophone, a passion that he kept throughout his life.<ref name="Grossman-Faulder" />{{RP|73–74}} He received the ''[[baccalauréat]] des lettres'' (high-school diploma with a major in [[French literature]], [[Latin]], and Greek) from the Gymnase Classique Cantonal de [[Lausanne]], and by 1945 had begun studying sciences at the [[University of Lausanne]], when [[World War II]] ended and the family was able to return to Thailand.<ref name=Kanchanapisek />

==Succession and marriage==
Bhumibol ascended the throne following the death by gunshot wound of his brother, King [[Ananda Mahidol]], on 9 June 1946, under circumstances that remain unclear. While a first government statement stated that Ananda had accidentally shot himself,<ref name=HandleyPM />{{RP|76–77}} an investigation committee ruled this was virtually impossible.<ref name=HandleyPM />{{RP|87}} Two palace aides were eventually convicted of [[regicide]] and executed. A third possibility, that Bhumibol accidentally shot his brother while the brothers played with their pistols, was never officially considered.<ref name=HandleyPM />{{RP|77–78}}<ref>For an in-depth exploration of this theory, see {{cite web |last1=MacGregor Marshall |first1=Andrew |title=Thailand's saddest secret |url=http://www.zenjournalist.com/2013/03/thailands-saddest-secret/ |date=2013}}</ref>

Bhumibol succeeded his brother, but returned to Switzerland before the end of the 100-day mourning period. Despite his interest in science and technology, he changed his major and enrolled in law and [[political science]] to prepare for his duties as head of state. His uncle, [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi|Rangsit, Prince of Chainat]], was appointed [[Regent of Thailand|Prince Regent]]. In Bhumibol's name, Prince Rangsit acknowledged a [[Siamese coup d'état of 1947|military coup that overthrew]] the government of [[Thawan Thamrongnawasawat|Thamrongnawasawat]] in November 1947.<ref name=HandleyPM />{{RP|88}} The regent also signed the [[Constitutions of Thailand|1949 constitution]], which returned to the monarchy many of the powers it had lost by the [[Siamese revolution of 1932|1932 Revolution]].<ref name=HandleyPM />{{RP|91–93}}

In December 1946, the Siamese government allocated several hundred thousand dollars for the ceremonial cremation of the remains of the late King Ananda, a necessary preliminary to the coronation of Bhumibol who was required by religious custom to light the funeral pyre. Unsettled conditions in 1947 following a coup d'état resulted in a postponement, and court astrologers determined that 2 March 1949 was the most auspicious date.<ref name="TelegraphObituary">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/10/13/king-bhumibol-adulyadej-of-thailand--obituary/|title=King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand – obituary|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 October 2016}}</ref>

While doing his degree in Switzerland, Bhumibol visited Paris frequently. It was in Paris that he first met [[Mom Rajawongse]] [[Sirikit]] Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France ([[Nakkhatra Mangala]]) and a great-granddaughter of King [[Chulalongkorn]] and thus a [[cousin]] of Bhumibol.

On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol was driving a [[Fiat Topolino]] on the [[Geneva]]-[[Lausanne]] road, he [[rear-end collision|collided with the rear]] of a braking truck 10&nbsp;km outside Lausanne.

After presiding over the long-delayed, ceremonial cremation of his brother [[Ananda Mahidol]], Bhumibol was crowned King of Thailand on 5 May 1950 in the Baisal Daksin Throne Hall in the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. It was the first [[Coronation of the Thai monarch|coronation ceremony]] of a Thai sovereign to rule under the system of [[constitutional monarchy]].<ref name="TelegraphObituary" /> During the ceremony, he pledged that he would "reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese people" ("เราจะครองแผ่นดินโดยธรรม เพื่อประโยชน์สุขแห่งมหาชนชาวสยาม").<ref name="oath">{{cite web |url=http://www.2bangkok.com/news05t.shtml |title=Royal Power Controversy |website=2Bangkok.com |accessdate=4 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018132746/http://www.2bangkok.com/news05t.shtml |archive-date=18 October 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Notable elements associated with the coronation included the [[Bahadrabith Throne]] beneath the Great White Umbrella of State and royal regalia and utensils.<ref name="regalia_utensils">{{cite web|title=The Royal Regalia and Royal Utensils of Siam|url=http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/royal-regalia_utensils.html|website=Chiangmai & Chiangrai Magazine|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906090634/http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/royal-regalia_utensils.html|archivedate=6 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1950 on Coronation Day, Bhumibol's consort was made queen ([[Thai royal and noble titles#Somdej Phra Boromarajini|Somdej Phra Boromarajini]]). The date of his coronation is celebrated each 5 May in Thailand as [[Coronation Day]], a public holiday. On 9 June 2006, Bhumibol celebrated his 60th anniversary as the King of Thailand, becoming the longest reigning monarch in Thai history.

In the early years of his reign, during the government of military dictator [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]], Bhumibol had no real political power and was little more than a ceremonial figure under the military-dominated government. In August 1957, six months after parliamentary elections, General [[Sarit Thanarat]] accused the government of Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram of ''[[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse-majesté]]'' due to its conduct of the 2,500th anniversary celebration of [[Buddhism]].<ref name=HandleyPM />{{RP|129–130,136–137}}<ref name="Thak1979" /> On 16 September 1957, Phibunsongkhram went to Bhumibol to seek support for his government.<ref>{{cite book |author=Suwannathat-Pian, Kobkua |title=Thailand's Durable Premier |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |page=30 |isbn=967-65-3053-0}}</ref> Bhumibol advised the field marshal to resign to avoid a coup. Phibunsongkhram refused. That evening, Sarit Thanarat seized power.

It included the following:<ref>{{cite journal|date= 16 September 1957|title=The Proclamation Appointing the Military Defender|journal=The Government Gazette of Thailand|volume=74|issue=76|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2500/A/076/1.PDF}}</ref>

<blockquote>Whereas it appears that the public administration by the government under the premiership of Field Marshal P. Phibunsongkhram is untrustworthy, and that the government could not maintain the public order; and whereas the military, led by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, has successfully taken over the public administration and now acts as the Military Defender of the Capital; now, therefore, I do hereby appoint Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat as the Military Defender of the Capital, and command that all the citizens shall remain calm whilst all the government officers shall serve the orders issued by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat. This Proclamation shall come into force immediately. Done this 16th Day of September, Buddhist Era 2500 (1957).</blockquote> Sarit later admitted in a rare interview with foreign correspondent that the king had no involvement and did not acknowledge anything about the coup until it had been done successfully.<ref>Translated from Matichon Weekly. 20–26 July 2018 p.55.</ref>

During Sarit's dictatorship, the monarchy was revitalised. Bhumibol attended public ceremonies, toured the provinces and patronised development projects, he also visited the [[United States]] and many countries in [[Europe]]. Under Sarit, the practice of crawling in front of royalty during audiences, banned by King [[Chulalongkorn]], was revived in certain situations and the royal-sponsored [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya|Thammayut Nikaya]] order was revitalised. For the first time since the absolute monarchy was overthrown, a king was conveyed up the [[Chao Phraya River]] in a [[Royal Barge Procession]] to offer robes at temples.<ref>{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Dr. Grant |author2=citing Christine Gray |year=1998 |url=http://www.laosnet.org/fa-ngum/ewans.htm |title=The Politics of Ritual and Remembrance: Laos since 1975 |website=Laosnet.org |accessdate=5 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Evans, Dr. Grant |title=The Politics of Ritual and Remembrance: Laos since 1975 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=1998 |pages=89–113 |isbn=0-8248-2054-1}}</ref>

Following Sarit's death General [[Thanom Kittikachorn]] rose to power to lead Thailand's military dictatorship, ultimately challenged by the [[1973 Thai popular uprising]]. Bhumibol initially asked student protestors to disband. When police attacked and killed dozens of students, sparking protest riots, Bhumibol announced general Thanom's resignation and departure from Thailand.<ref name="rosario">{{cite book|last1=Rosario|first1=Prizzia|title=Thailand in transition: the role of oppositional forces|date=1985|publisher=University of Hawaii Press}}</ref>
According to William Stevenson, the king had asked the three tyrants to avoid bloodshed, although the three tyrants had agreed, they later changed their minds. Eventually, it led to the incidents of October 1973.<ref>Stevenson, William (2001). The Revolutionary King. Constable and Robinson. P. 180-183</ref>

Bhumibol distanced himself from the Thai military after Thanom's fall. Political events in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos brought powerful guerrilla and communist movements into power or prominence, which threatened the Thai monarchy and political establishment. Fearing unrest, Bhumibol began to court the military in 1975, visiting camps throughout the country, and publicly warning of internal and external threats.<ref name="mallet" />{{RP|87}} At this time, Bhumibol increasingly cultivated far-right militias and paramilitary forces, including the [[Red Gaurs]] and the Village Scouts, warning that students and political dissidents planned to bring communists to power in Thailand.<ref name=HandleyPM />{{RP|232-9}} Finally, Bhumibol provoked outrage among students and legal groups by inviting general Thanom back into the country.

The ensuing chaos was used as a pretext for a military coup, which Bhumibol backed and described as a manifestation of the people's will.<ref name="mallet">{{cite journal|last1=Mallet|first1=Marian|title=Causes and Consequences of the October '76 Coup|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1978|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://thirdworld.nl/causes-and-consequences-of-the-october-76-coup|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006012057/http://thirdworld.nl/causes-and-consequences-of-the-october-76-coup|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-10-06|accessdate=5 October 2016}}</ref>{{RP|90-1}} The event that catalyzed the coup was the [[Thammasat University massacre]], carried out in the name of defending Bhumibol's throne.<ref name=HandleyPM />{{RP|9}} The victorious military junta submitted three names to the king as possible premiers: Deputy President of the king's [[Privy Council]] [[Prakob Hutasingh]], right-wing Bangkok Governor [[Thamnoon Thien-ngern]], and staunchly anti-communist Supreme Court judge [[Thanin Kraivichien]].<ref name="mallet" />{{RP|90-1}}<ref name="nationgracious">{{cite web |date=2 February 2007 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/webblog/view_blog.php?uid=492&bid=1817%20His%20Gracious%20Majesty |title=His Gracious Majesty |work=The Nation |accessdate=25 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013115031/http://nationmultimedia.com/webblog/view_blog.php?uid=492&bid=1817%20His%20Gracious%20Majesty |archivedate=13 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Thanin was a member of the [[Nawaphon]] monarchist paramilitary group, which had the backing of the [[CIA]], and which Bhumibol was alleged to have sponsored.<ref name="mallet" />{{RP|84-5}}{{Citation needed|reason=This citation's linked document does not contain the words CIA or Central Intelligence Agency- a new accurate citation needed here to support this CIA related claim|date=December 2019}} Bhumibol chose Thanin as the most suitable premier, leading student protesters to flee to join the communists in the jungle.

{{Main|Black May (1992) }}

In 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand's transition to a democratic system. A coup on 23 February 1991 returned Thailand to military dictatorship. After a general election in 1992, the majority parties invited General [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]], a leader of the coup group, to be prime minister. This caused much dissent, which escalated into demonstrations that led to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control protesters. The situation became increasingly critical as police and military forces clashed with protesters. Violence and riots spread to many areas of the capital with rumours of a rift among the armed forces.<ref name="bloodymay">{{cite web|year=2000 |url=http://www.seameo.org/vl/92may/92may1.htm |title=Development Without Harmony |publisher=Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization |accessdate=26 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927141226/http://www.seameo.org/vl/92may/92may1.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

Amidst the fear of civil war, Bhumibol intervened. He summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, retired Major General [[Chamlong Srimuang]], to a televised audience, and urged them to find a peaceful resolution. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation, and led to Suchinda's resignation soon afterwards.

It was one of the few occasions in which Bhumibol directly and publicly intervened in a political conflict. A general election was held shortly afterward, leading to a civilian government.<ref name="srimuang">{{cite web|year=2000|url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographySrimuangCha.htm|title=Biography of Chamlong Srimuang|work=The 1992 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service|publisher=Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation|accessdate=26 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014004644/http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographySrimuangCha.htm|archivedate=14 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{See also|2005–06 Thai political crisis}}
Weeks before the [[April 2006 Thailand legislative election|April 2006 legislative election]], the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]]-led opposition and the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] petitioned Bhumibol to appoint a replacement prime minister and cabinet. Demands for royal intervention were met with much criticism from the public. Bhumibol, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded, "Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational".<ref name="invalidate">{{cite web| url= http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/27/headlines/headlines_30002592.php| title= HM the King's 26 April speeches| work= The Nation| accessdate= 5 July 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060708001830/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/27/headlines/headlines_30002592.php| archivedate= 8 July 2006| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}</ref>

After publicly claiming victory in the boycotted [[April 2006 Thailand legislative election|April parliamentary elections]], [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] had a private audience with the king. A few hours later, Thaksin appeared on national television to announce that he would be taking a break from politics.

In May 2006, the [[Sondhi Limthongkul]]-owned ''[[Manager Daily]]'' newspaper published a series of articles describing the "[[Finland Plot]]", alleging that Thaksin and former members of the [[Communist Party of Thailand]] planned to overthrow the king and seize control of the nation. No evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his [[Thai Rak Thai]] party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.

In a rare, televised speech to senior judges, Bhumibol requested the judiciary to take action to resolve the political crisis.<ref name="invalidate"/> On 8 May 2006, the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] invalidated the results of the April elections and ordered [[October 2006 Thailand legislative election|new elections scheduled for 15 October 2006]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php |title=Constitution Court invalidate the April election and order new election |work=The Nation |accessdate=5 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616174003/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php |archivedate=16 June 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Criminal Court later jailed the Election Commissioners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/25/headlines/headlines_30009521.php |title=EC Commissioners arrive at Bangkok Remand Prison |work=The Nation |accessdate=25 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805193731/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/25/headlines/headlines_30009521.php |archivedate=5 August 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=111195 |title=EC Guilty in Historic Ruling |work=Bangkok Post |accessdate=25 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010030203/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=111195 |archivedate=10 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>

====The coup====

On the evening of 19 September, the Thai military overthrew the Thaksin government and seized control of Bangkok in a bloodless coup. The junta, led by the [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin]], Commander of the Army, called itself the [[Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarchy]]. It accused the deposed prime minister and his regime of crimes, including lèse majesté, and pledged its loyalty to Bhumibol. Martial law was declared, the constitution repealed and the October elections cancelled. Protests and political meetings were banned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,214498,00.html |title=Thai Military Launches Coup to Remove PM Thaksin |agency=Associated Press |work=Fox News |accessdate=19 September 2006 |date=19 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920220834/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C214498%2C00.html |archivedate=20 September 2006 }}</ref>

====After the coup====
The junta appointed a [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|constitutional tribunal]] to rule on alleged polling fraud involving the [[Thai Rak Thai Party|Thai Rak Thai]] and [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat]] political parties. Guilty rulings would have dissolved both parties, Thailand's largest and oldest, respectively, and banned the parties' leadership from politics for five years. The weeks leading up to the verdicts saw rising political tensions. On 24 May 2007, about a week before the scheduled verdict, Bhumibol gave a rare speech to the Supreme Administrative Court (the president of which is also a member of the constitutional tribunal). "You have the responsibility to prevent the country from collapsing", he warned them in the speech, which was shown on all national television channels simultaneously during the evening. "The nation needs political parties... In my mind, I have a judgment but I cannot say", he said. "Either way the ruling goes, it will be bad for the country, there will be mistakes".<ref name="chinapost1">{{cite web |last=Ahuja|first=Ambika |date=25 May 2007|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/international/110557.htm |title=Thai king urges firm, clear verdict in key case |work=China Post |location=Taiwan (ROC) |accessdate=25 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030424/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/international/110557.htm| archivedate= 30 September 2007| url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="gulftimes1">{{cite web |date=25 May 2007|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/international/110557.htm |title=Thai king against dissolving parties |work=Gulf Times|accessdate=25 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030424/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/international/110557.htm| archivedate= 30 September 2007| url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="bbcxyz">{{cite news |date=25 May 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6690441.stm  |title=Thai king warns over court ruling |work=BBC News|accessdate=25 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071007151710/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6690441.stm| archivedate= 7 October 2007| url-status= live}}</ref> The tribunal later acquitted the Democrat Party, but dissolved the Thai Rak Thai Party and banned 111 of its executives from politics for five years.

==Royal powers==

===Constitutional powers===
{{For|a historical perspective on how Bhumibol's constitutional powers changed over time, see|Constitutions of Thailand}}

[[File:Rama IX of Thailand and Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|Bhumibol in a meeting with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], 18 November 2012]]

Bhumibol retained enormous powers, partly because of his immense popularity and partly because his powers – although clearly defined in the Thai constitution – were often subject to conflicting interpretations. This was highlighted by the controversy surrounding the appointment of [[Jaruvan Maintaka]] as Auditor-General. Jaruvan had been appointed by The State Audit Commission, but in July 2004, the Constitutional Court ruled that her appointment was unconstitutional. Jaruvan refused to vacate her office without an explicit order from Bhumibol, on the grounds that she had previously been royally approved. When the Senate elected a replacement for Jaruvan, Bhumibol refused to approve him.<ref>{{cite web |date=9 September 2005|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p25.php |title=My govt serves His Majesty |publisher=The Nation |accessdate=14 August 2006}}</ref> The Senate declined to vote to override Bhumibol's veto.<ref>{{cite web |date=11 October 2005|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p53.php |title=Senate steers clear of motion on Jaruvan |publisher=The Nation |accessdate=14 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060828215631/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p53.php| archivedate= 28 August 2006| url-status= live}}</ref> Finally in February 2006 the Audit Commission reinstated Jaruvan when it became clear from a memo from the Office of the King's Principal Private Secretary that King Bhumibol supported her appointment.<!--Senator [[Kaewsan Atibhodi]], a former member of the 1997 Constitution Drafting Committee, noted that under Article Seven of the 1997 Constitution said that: "whenever no provision under this Constitution is applicable to any case, it shall be decided in accordance with the constitutional practice in the democratic regime of government with the King as Head of the State".

Bhumibol only vetoed legislation on rare occasions.

The law was not enforced as General Sarit soon overthrew the elected government in a coup and repealed the law.

Bhumibol had the constitutional prerogative to pardon criminals, although there are several criteria for receiving a pardon, including age and remaining sentence. The 2006 pardoning of several convicted [[Child sexual abuse|child rapists]], including an Australian rapist and [[child pornography|child pornographer]], caused controversy.<ref>{{cite web |year=2006 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30007691 |title=Aussie pedophile free on royal pardon |work=The Nation |accessdate=5 July 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060707203217/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30007691 |archivedate = 7 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=McDonald |first=Phillipa |date=30 June 2006 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200606/s1675208.htm |title=Campaigners condemn paedophile's release |work=ABC News Online |accessdate=5 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702065255/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200606/s1675208.htm |archivedate=2 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bathersby |first=Damien |date=2 July 2006 |url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3690777&thesection=localnews&thesubsection=&thesecondsubsection= |title=Royal pardon for child predator |work=Sunshine Coast Daily |accessdate=5 July 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> However, under the Thai constitution, the king has the prerogative to grant pardons and all laws, royal rescripts, and royal commands relating to state affairs must be countersigned by a minister unless otherwise provided for in the constitution.

===Network monarchy and extraconstitutional powers===
[[File:King bhumibol monument.jpg|thumb|right|upright|City decoration in observance of King Bhumibol's birthday in [[Phitsanulok]], Thailand]]

Several academics outside Thailand, including [[Duncan McCargo]] and Federico Ferrara, noted the active but indirect political involvement of Bhumibol through a "network monarchy", whose most significant proxy is Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda. McCargo claimed that Bhumibol's conservative network worked behind the scenes to establish political influence in the 1990s, but was threatened by the landslide election victories of Thaksin Shinawatra in 2001 and 2005.<ref>Duncan McCargo, Network monarchy and legitimacy crises in Thailand, The Pacific Review, Volume 18, Issue 4 December 2005</ref> Ferrara claimed, shortly before the Thai Supreme Court delivered its verdict to seize Thaksin Shinawatra's assets, that the judiciary was a well-established part of Bhumibol's network and represented his main avenue to exercise extra-constitutional prerogatives despite having the appearance of being constitutional. He also noted how, in comparison to the Constitutional Court's 2001 acquittal of Thaksin, the judiciary was a much more important part of the "network" than it was in the past.<ref>Federico Ferrara, Thailand Unhinged: unraveling the myth of a Thai-style democracy, Equinox Publishing 2010</ref>

The network's ability to exercise power is based partly on Bhumibol's popularity and strict control of Bhumibol's popular image. According to Jost Pachaly of the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], Bhumibol "plays an important role behind the scenes. But the role is difficult to assess because nothing is reported about it and no one really knows anything specific", due to lese majeste laws forbidding discussion about Bhumibol's political activities.<ref>DW.de, [http://www.dw.de/thai-monarchy-a-hindrance-to-democracy/a-16555274 Thai monarchy a hindrance to democracy?], 28 January 2013</ref> Bhumibol's popularity was demonstrated following the [[2003 Phnom Penh riots]] in Cambodia, when hundreds of Thai protesters, enraged by rumors that Cambodian rioters had stomped on photographs of Bhumibol, gathered outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok. Photographs of the stomping were not published in Thailand, but were available on the internet. The situation was resolved peacefully only when Police General Sant Sarutanonda told the crowd that he had received a call from royal secretary Arsa Sarasin conveying Bhumibol's request for calm. The crowd dispersed.<ref>{{cite web |year=2003 |url=http://www.2bangkok.com/burning.shtml |title=The Burning of the Thai Embassy in Cambodia |publisher=The Nation, 2Bangkok.com |accessdate=5 July 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060626060437/http://www.2bangkok.com/burning.shtml| archivedate= 26 June 2006| url-status= live}}</ref>

Bhumibol was involved in many social and economic development projects. The nature of his involvement varied by political regime.<ref>{{cite web |last=Chitbundid |first=Chanida |year=2003 |url=http://tic.car.chula.ac.th/royal-projects/item/25749-the-royally-initiated-projects-the-making-of-royal-hegemony-b-e-2494-2546 |title=The Royally-initiated Projects: The Making of Royal Hegemony (B.E. 2494–2546) |publisher=Thammasat University |accessdate=27 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630004915/http://tic.car.chula.ac.th/royal-projects/item/25749-the-royally-initiated-projects-the-making-of-royal-hegemony-b-e-2494-2546 |archivedate=30 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The government of [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (1951–1957) limited Bhumibol to a ceremonial role. During that period Bhumibol produced some films and operated a radio station from Chitlada Palace using personal funds.

In the military governments of [[Sarit Thanarat]] and his successors (1958–1980), Bhumibol was portrayed as the "development King" and the inspiration for the economic and political goals of the regime. Royally ordered projects were implemented under the financial and political support of the government, including projects in rural areas and communities under the influence of the [[Communist Party of Thailand]]. Bhumibol's visits to these projects were heavily promoted by the Sarit government and broadcast in state-controlled media.

During the governments of General [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] (1981–1987), the relationship between the Thai state and the monarch was at its closest. Prem, later to become President of Bhumibol's [[Privy Council (Thailand)|Privy Council]], officially allocated government budgets and manpower to support royal projects. Most activities in this period involved the development of large-scale irrigation projects in rural areas.

During the modern period (post-1988), the structured development of the royal projects reached its apex. Bhumibol's [[Chaipattana Foundation]] was established, promoting his [[Localism in Thailand|"sufficiency economy"]] theory, an alternative to the export-oriented policies adopted by the period's elected governments. Following the 2006 coup, establishment of a "sufficiency economy" was enshrined in the constitution as being a primary goal of the government, and government financial support for royal projects was boosted.

Also called the Diamond Jubilee, the 60th anniversary celebrations of the king's accession to the throne were a series of events marking Bhumibol's reign in June 2006. Events included a [[Thailand's Royal Barge Procession|royal barge procession]] on the Chao Phraya River, fireworks displays, art exhibitions, and the pardoning of 25,000 prisoners,<ref>{{cite web|last=Pinyorat |first=Rungrawee C. |year=2006 |url=https://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2006/06/09/millions_of_thai_honor_king |title=Millions of Thai honor king |website=Boston.com News|agency=Associated Press |accessdate=5 July 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013150334/http://boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2006/06/09/millions_of_thai_honor_king |archivedate = 13 October 2007}}</ref> concerts, and dance performances.

Tied in with the anniversary, United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] presented Bhumibol with the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s first Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award on 26 May 2006. National holidays were observed on 9 June and 12–13 June 2006. On 9 June, the king and queen appeared on the balcony of [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]] before hundreds of thousands of people. The official royal barge procession on 12 June was attended by the king and queen and royal visitors from 26 other countries. On 13 June, a state banquet for the royal visitors was held in the newly constructed Rama IX Throne Hall at the Grand Palace, the first official function of the hall. The Chiang Mai Royal Floral Expo was also held to honour the anniversary.

On 16 January 2007, the CDRM officially declared the end of the 60th anniversary celebrations and commenced year-long celebrations of Bhumibol's 80th birthday.<ref name="hmanniv">{{cite news|date=16 February 2007 |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/16/headlines/headlines_30027071.php |title=Govt launches commemorative events for HM the King's 80th birthday |work=The Nation |accessdate=25 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013114934/http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/16/headlines/headlines_30027071.php |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Private life==
{{Chakri Kings}}
Bhumibol was a painter, musician, photographer, author and translator. His book ''Phra Mahachanok'' is based on a traditional ''[[Jataka]]'' story of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] scripture. ''The Story of Thong Daeng'' is the story of his dog [[Tongdaeng|Thong Daeng]].<ref>HM King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. ''The Story of Tongdaeng''. Amarin, Bangkok. 2004. {{ISBN|974-272-917-4}}</ref>

In his youth, Bhumibol was greatly interested in firearms. He kept a carbine, a Sten gun and two automatic pistols in his bedroom, and he and his elder brother, King [[Ananda Mahidol]], often used the gardens of the palace for target practice.<ref name=HandleyPM />{{RP|70}}

There are two English-language books that provide extensive detail—albeit not always verifiable—about Bhumibol's life, especially his early years and then throughout his entire reign. One is ''The Revolutionary King'' (2001) by William Stevenson, the other is ''[[The King Never Smiles]]'' (2006) by Paul M. Handley. A third and earlier work, ''[[The Devil's Discus]]'' (1964), is also available in Thai and English. The latter two books are banned in Thailand, while the first has never been sold in the country due to its "inaccuracies", despite having been written with royal patronage.<ref name=HandleyPM />{{RP|162}}

Bhumibol's creativity in, among other things, music, art and invention, was the focus of a two-minute long documentary created by the government of Abhibisit Vejjajiva that was screened at all branches of the Major Cineplex Group and SF Cinema City, the two largest cinema chains in Thailand.<ref>MCOT, [https://archive.today/20120903182753/http://www.mcot.net/content/19232 Commerce Ministry launches film to honour creative King Bhumibol], 10 February 2010</ref>

Much of it is jazz swing but he also composed marches, waltzes, and Thai patriotic songs. His most popular compositions were ''Candlelight Blues'', ''Love at Sundown'', and ''Falling Rain'' which were all composed in 1946.<ref name=WP26Jun06/> Bhumibol's musical influences included [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Sidney Bechet]], [[Benny Carter]], and [[Johnny Hodges]].<ref name=WP26Jun06/> The Bhumibol Adulyadej (King of Thailand) Collection, 1946–1954 at the [[Library of Congress]] Music Division includes some of his compositions, including 13 music manuscripts, 100 pieces of printed music, clippings, correspondence, and other miscellaneous documents.<ref>[https://lccn.loc.gov/2006560670 Bhumibol Adulyadej (King of Thailand) Collection, 1946-1954] at [[Library of Congress]]</ref>

Bhumibol initially received general music training privately while he was studying in Switzerland, but his older brother, then King [[Ananda Mahidol]], who had bought a saxophone, sent Bhumibol in his place.<ref name=BPJan06/> King Ananda would later join him on the clarinet.<ref name=BPJan06/> On his permanent return to Thailand in 1950, Bhumibol started a jazz band, Lay Kram, whom he performed with on a radio station he started at his palace.<ref name=BPJan06/> The band grew, being renamed the Au Sau Wan Suk Band and he would perform with them live on Friday evenings, occasionally taking telephoned requests.<ref name=BPJan06/> Bhumibol also performed with his band at Thai universities, composing anthems for the universities of Chulalongkorn, Thammasat, and Kasetsart.<ref name=BPJan06/> Bhumibol performed with [[Benny Goodman]] at the [[Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall]], in 1956, and later played at Goodman's home in New York in 1960.<ref name=WP26Jun06/> Many bands such as [[Les Brown and His Band of Renown]], [[Claude Bolling|Claude Bolling Big Band]], and [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]] recorded some of Bhumibol's compositions and can still be heard in Thailand.<ref name=WP26Jun06/> A 1996 documentary, ''Gitarajan'', was made about Bhumibol's music.<ref name=WP26Jun06/>

Bhumibol still played music with his Au Sau Wan Suk Band in later years, but was rarely heard in public.<ref name=BPJan06/> In 1964, Bhumibol became the 23rd person to receive the Certificate of Bestowal of Honorary Membership on behalf of Vienna's [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|University of Music and Performing Arts]].<ref name="Music"/> In 2000, he was awarded the [[Sanford Medal]] for his contribution in music from [[Yale School of Music]].

Bhumibol's influence is widely regarded as one reason why Thailand, and Bangkok in particular, has for decades had a strong jazz and improvised music "scene" relative to other Asian nations.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The wealth and properties of Bhumibol and the royal family are managed by the Privy Purse. The CPB manages the assets of the Crown as an institution. It was established by law, but is directed without the involvement of the Thai government and reports only to the king.<ref name="FORBES">{{cite news |first=Devon |last=Pendelton |first2= Tatiana |last2= Serafin |title= The World's Richest Royals |date=30 August 2007|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/30/worlds-richest-royals-biz-royals07-cx_lk_0830royalintro.html |work=Forbes |accessdate=4 March 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080303215406/http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/30/worlds-richest-royals-biz-royals07-cx_lk_0830royalintro.html| archivedate= 3 March 2008| url-status= live}}</ref> The CPB receives many state privileges.

The CPB also lets or leases about 36,000 properties to third parties, including the sites of the [[Anantara Siam Bangkok Hotel]], the [[Suan Lum Night Bazaar]], [[Siam Paragon]], and the [[Central World Plaza|Central World Tower]]. The CPB spearheaded a plan to turn Bangkok's historical [[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] into a shopping street known as the "[[Champs-Élysées]] of Asia" and in 2007, shocked longtime residents of traditional marketplace districts by serving them with eviction notices.<ref name= sentinel>{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=402&Itemid=32 |title=Thailand's Royal Wealth: How Thailand's Royals Manage to Own All the Good Stuff |work=Asia Sentinel |date=1 March 2007 |accessdate=25 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212544/http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=402&Itemid=32 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Crown's substantial income from the CPB, estimated to be at least five billion baht in 2004, is exempt from taxes.<ref name= sentinel /><ref name= crownact>{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://www.crownproperty.or.th/history.php |title=Royal Assets Structuring Act of 1936 |website=The Crown Property Bureau |language=th |accessdate= 25 September 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070809204241/http://www.crownproperty.or.th/history.php |archivedate = 9 August 2007}} (พระราชบัญญัติ จัดระเบียบทรัพย์สิน ฝ่ายพระมหากษัตริย์)</ref>

==Criticism==
[[File:2012 CM Governors reception for HM's birthday 02.jpg|thumb|300px|A government officer pays respect to the portrait of King Bhumibol.]]
{{main|Lèse majesté in Thailand}}
Although Bhumibol was held in great respect by many Thais,<ref name="Head-20071205" /> he was also protected by some of the strictest ''[[lèse-majesté]]'' laws in the world. Under these laws, critics could be jailed for three to fifteen years.<ref name="reuters1">{{cite news |last=Champion |first=Paul |date=25 September 2007|url=https://www.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=67215&videoChannel=1 |title=Professor in lese majeste row|agency=Reuters |accessdate=26 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013134234/https://www.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=67215&videoChannel=1| archivedate= 13 October 2007| url-status= live}}</ref> After the Thammasat University Massacre in 1976, the laws were toughened during the dictatorship of royalist and anti-communist Premier [[Thanin Kraivichien]]. Criticism of any member of the royal family, the royal development projects, the royal institution, the Chakri Dynasty or any previous Thai king was also banned.

During his 2005 birthday speech, Bhumibol invited criticism: "Actually, I must also be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know. Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human", he claimed. "If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong."<ref name="wrong"/> A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in ''lèse-majesté'' prosecutions. ''Lèse-majesté'' cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=High time to concede the Thai king can do wrong|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f3ad24f4-b305-11e0-86b8-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1h67G3sai|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=Financial Times|date=20 July 2011|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

Although ''lèse-majesté'' officially only applies to current kings, in practice the laws are very broadly construed and flexible. Even after his death, Bhumibol remains protected by ''lèse-majesté''.

==Biographies==
American journalist Paul Handley, who spent thirteen years in Thailand, wrote the biography ''[[The King Never Smiles]]''. The [[Thailand Ministry of Information and Communication Technology|Information and Communications Ministry]] banned the book and blocked the book's page on the [[Yale University Press]] website in January 2006. In a statement dated 19 January 2006, Thai National Police Chief General [[Kowit Wattana]] said the book had "contents which could affect national security and the good morality of the people".<ref>{{cite web |last=Warrick-Alexander |first=James|date=6 February 2006|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/article.asp?AID=31649 |title=Thailand Bars Univ. Website |publisher=Yale Daily News |accessdate=5 July 2006}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The book provided a detailed discussion of Bhumibol's role in Thai political history, and it also analyzed the factors behind Bhumibol's popularity.

[[William Stevenson (Canadian writer)|William Stevenson]], who had access to the royal court and the royal family, wrote the biography ''The Revolutionary King'' in 2001.<ref>{{cite book |author=Stevenson, William |title=The Revolutionary King |publisher=Constable and Robinson |year=2001 |isbn=1-84119-451-4}}</ref> An article in ''Time'' said the idea for the book was suggested by Bhumibol.<ref name="Time magazine">{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Terry |date=6 December 1999|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1206/thai1.king.html |title=The King and Ire |work=Time Asia |accessdate=5 July 2006}}</ref> Critics noted that the book displayed intimate knowledge about personal aspects of Bhumibol. However, the book was unofficially banned in Thailand and the Bureau of the Royal Household warned the Thai media about even referring to it in print. An official ban was not possible as it was written with Bhumibol's blessing. The book was criticised for factual inaccuracies, disrespecting Bhumibol (it refers to him by his personal nickname "Lek"), and proposing a controversial theory explaining the mysterious death of [[Ananda Mahidol|King Ananda]]. Stevenson said: "The king said from the beginning the book would be dangerous for him and for me."<ref name="Time magazine" />

==Succession to the throne==
[[File:Royal Flag of King Rama IX.svg|thumb|200px|right|The King's [[Royal Cypher]] and [[Royal Flags of Thailand|personal flag]]]]
Bhumibol's only son, Prince [[Vajiralongkorn]], was given the title "Somdej Phra Boroma Orasadhiraj Chao Fah Maha Vajiralongkorn Sayam Makutrajakuman" (Crown Prince of Siam) on 28 December 1972 and made heir apparent (องค์รัชทายาท) to the throne in accordance with the [[Palace Law on Succession of 1924]].<ref>[http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2515/A/200/1.PDF The Royal Gazette, 28 December 1972]</ref>

On 5 December 1977, Princess Sirindhorn was given the title "Siam Boromrajakumari" (Princess Royal of Siam). Her title is often translated by the English-language press as "Crown Princess", although her official English-language title is simply "Princess".<ref>{{cite web |year=2004 |url=http://kanchanapisek.or.th/biography/sirindhorn/index.en.html |title=Biography of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn |publisher=The Golden Jubilee Network |accessdate=5 July 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060702014151/http://kanchanapisek.or.th/biography/sirindhorn/index.en.html| archivedate= 2 July 2006| url-status= live}}</ref>

Although the [[Constitution of Thailand|constitution]] was later amended to allow the [[Privy Council (Thailand)|Privy Council]] to appoint a princess as successor to the throne, this would only occur in the absence of an heir apparent. This amendment is retained in Section 23 of the [[Constitution of Thailand|1997 "People's Constitution"]]. This effectively allowed Princess [[Sirindhorn]] to potentially be second in line to the throne, but did not affect Prince [[Vajiralongkorn]]'s status as heir apparent.

Recent constitutions of Thailand have made the amendment of the [[1924 Palace Law of Succession|Palace Law of Succession]] the sole prerogative of the reigning king. According to Assoc. Prof. Gothom Arya, former election commissioner, this allows the reigning king, if he so chooses, to appoint his son or any of his daughters to the throne.<ref>{{cite web|last=Aryan |first=Gothan |date=16 September 2004 |url=http://www.idea.int/news/upload/Nepal%20-%20Thai%20monarchy%20paper%20-%20Gothom%20Aryan.pdf |title=Thai Monarchy |publisher=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance |accessdate=5 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623005429/http://www.idea.int/news/upload/Nepal%20-%20Thai%20monarchy%20paper%20-%20Gothom%20Aryan.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead }} presented in Kathmandu, Nepal</ref>

King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Thai full title was "'''Phra Bat Somdet Phra Poraminthra Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej Mahitalathibet Ramathibodi Chakkrinaruebodin Sayamminthrathirat Borommanatbophit'''" ({{lang-th|พระบาทสมเด็จพระปรมินทรมหาภูมิพลอดุลยเดช มหิตลาธิเบศรรามาธิบดี จักรีนฤบดินทร สยามินทราธิราช บรมนาถบพิตร}}; {{Audio|Th-King Bhumibol's ceremonial name.ogg|listen}}), which was referred to in the chief legal documents; and in general documents, the title was shortened to "''Phra Bat Somdet Phra Poraminthra Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej Sayamminthrathirat Borommanatbophit''" or just "''Phra Bat Somdet Phra Poraminthra Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej''".

When his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne on 1 December 2016, King Bhumibol was referred as '''Phra Bat Somdet Phra Poraminthra Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej Borommanatbophit''' ({{lang-th|พระบาทสมเด็จพระปรมินทรมหาภูมิพลอดุลยเดช บรมนาถบพิตร}})

The literal translation of the title was as follows:<ref name=Kanchanapisek>{{cite web|title=Biography of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej|url=http://kanchanapisek.or.th/biography/hmk.en.html|website=The Golden Jubilee Network|publisher=Kanchanapisek Network|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>
* ''Phra Bat'' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:พระบาท|พระบาท]]}}) – "Divine Feet", an honorific given to a god or monarch
* ''Somdet'' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:สมเด็จ|สมเด็จ]]}}) – "Supremacy", an honorific given to a god or monarch

* ''Maha'' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:มหา|มหา]]}}) – "Great"
* ''Bhumibol'' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:ภูมิ|ภูมิ]] [[:wikt:พล|พล]]}}) – "Strength of the Land"

* ''Borommanatbophit'' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:บรมนาถบพิตร|บรมนาถบพิตร]]}}) – "Supreme Holy Shelter"

On 5 May 2019, Vajiralongkorn bestowed on his father the title '''Phra Bat Somdet Phra Boromchanakathibet Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej Maharaj Borommanatbophit''' ({{lang-th|พระบาทสมเด็จพระบรมชนกาธิเบศร มหาภูมิพลอดุลยเดชมหาราช บรมนาถบพิตร}}). It is extremely rare for a King to be bestowed with a distinction of ''"Maharaja"'' (The Great). The last of such was for King Taksin which was posthumously given in 1981, nearly 200 years since the latter's demise. Until 5 May 2019, King Rama I and King Rama V was the only Chakri Dynasty monarchs to be given such distinctions.
