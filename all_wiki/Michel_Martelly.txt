'''Michel Joseph Martelly'''<ref name=MiamiHeraldApr2012/> ({{IPA-fr|miʃɛl ʒɔzɛf maʁteli}}; born 12 February 1961)<ref name=Miller/> is a Haitian singer and former politician who served as the [[President of Haiti]] from May 2011 until February 2016. He is from [[Côte-de-fer]], a commune located in the South East of Haiti. Martelly was one of Haiti's best-known musicians for over a decade, going by the stage name '''Sweet Micky'''. For business and musical reasons, Martelly has moved a number of times between the United States and Haiti. When travelling to the United States, Martelly mostly stays in Florida. After his presidency, Martelly returned to his former band and sang a carnival [[meringue]] entitled "Bal Bannan nan" (Give Her the Banana), as a mocking response to [[Liliane Pierre Paul]], a famous Haitian female journalist in Port-au-prince.<ref>{{cite web|title=Haiti's president releases sexually suggestive song targeting journalist|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/02/haiti-president-michel-martelly-song-targets-journalist-activist-sweet-micky-bal-bannann-nan|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

As a singer and keyboardist, "Sweet Micky" is known for his [[Kompa]] music, a style of Haitian dance music sung predominantly in the Haitian Creole language, but he blended this with other styles. Martelly popularized a "new generation" of compas with smaller bands relying on synthesizers and electronic instruments. From 1989 to 2008, Martelly recorded over a dozen studio albums and a number of live CDs. As a musician and club owner in Haiti in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Martelly became associated with the neo-Duvalierist [[Defence Force of Haiti|Haitian military]] and police, including figures such as police chief [[Michel François]], and he agreed with the [[1991 Haitian coup d'état]] against [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. In 1995, after Aristide had been restored to office, Martelly's name appeared on a hit list of coup supporters, and he stayed away from Haiti for almost a year. During this time, he released a song, "Prezidan" (on the album ''Pa Manyen''), "an exuberant ditty that called for a president who played compas".<ref name=Ackerman321/> However, he did not run for political office until 2010, when he became a candidate for President of Haiti.

After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|catastrophic earthquake]], Martelly won the [[Haitian general election, 2010–11]] for his party [[Repons Peyizan]] (''Farmers' Response Party''), after a run-off against candidate [[Mirlande Manigat]]. Martelly had come in third in the first round of the election, until the [[Organization of American States]] forced [[Jude Célestin]] to withdraw due to alleged fraud. Martelly assumed his position of the [[President of Haiti]] on 14 May 2011 after [[René Préval]] retired to his home in Marmelade. His election campaign included a promise to reinstate the nation's military, which had been abolished in the 1990s by [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]].

== Early life ==
Martelly was born in [[Cote de Fer]], the son of Gerard Martelly, a [[Shell Oil]] executive and Marie Madeleine Martelly (''née'' De Pradines, b. 1931 – d. 21 October 2016).<ref name="Miami New Times">{{cite news|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/his-music-rules-in-haiti-6360759|title=BREAKING NEWS: Michel Joseph Martelly celebrities as they laid to rest his mother, Marie Madeleine D.

Upon his return to Haiti, Martelly had his first breakthrough in the music industry when he began playing keyboard as a fill-in musician in local venues in [[Pétion-Ville]] and [[Kenscoff]], upscale suburbs of Port-au-Prince.<ref name=Ackerman321>Ackerman, Elise.

== Music ==
Martelly has been heralded as a pioneer of a unique genre of [[compas]], a style of Haitian dance music sung predominantly in the [[Haitian Creole]] language. Originally, compas, was the creation of [[Nemours Jean-Baptiste]]. Martelly, a keyboardist and the self-proclaimed "President of Compas," popularized a ''nouvelle génération'', or "new generation" style, of smaller bands with few members that relied predominantly on synthesizers and electronic instruments to reproduce a fuller sound. Martelly's live performances and recordings are sometimes laced with physical humor and humorous sociopolitical commentaries and satires. Although he is the most recognized musician and public personality in Haiti, Martelly's performance style has sometimes ignited controversy throughout Haitian communities.

===Recording career===
By 1988, Martelly's musical talent, stage craft, and his pattering style of [[compas]] had gained tremendous popularity at El Rancho Hotel and Casino and The Florville, another local venues. That year, he recorded his first single, "Ou La La", which became an instant hit, followed by "Konpas 'Foret des Pins'" in 1989, also from his debut album ''Ou La La''. During the period of about 1988–2008 Martelly, using his stage name Sweet Micky, recorded fourteen studio albums and a number of live CDs. His music features slow méringue, [[compas]], [[troubadour]], carnival méringue, [[rabòday]], etc.

In 1997, Martelly's crossover appeal to other musical genres was evident when hip hop star, [[Wyclef Jean]] of [[The Fugees]] featured him on the title track for Jean's solo effort ''Wyclef Jean Presents The Carnival featuring the Refugee Allstars''. As Jean proclaims on 'The Carnival,' "Surprise – it's Sweet Micky, y'all!" Also in 1997, Martelly released an album containing one of his most celebrated hits, Pa Manyen ("Don't Touch"). The song is an adaptation of "Angola", composed by the renowned artist/composer/record producer [[Ramiro Mendes]] (of the Mendes Brothers), first recorded by [[Cesária Évora]], the legendary Cape Verdean singer. Pa Manyen went on to be featured in various compilation albums, including the popular ''Putumayo Presents: French Caribbean'' in 2003. The song was also covered by Venezuelan singer, [[Soledad Bravo]] as "Canta, Canta Corazon" and by Jose Luiz Cortes of Cuba. See also the Mendes Brothers' original version of the song, performed by Ramiro Mendes included in the group's 1997 album—''Para Angola Com Um Xi Coracao''. Martelly is also notorious for his cursing on stage, cross-dressing as well as using homophobic slurs. His celebrity status as a popular compas musician would become a major factor in his popularity as a politician.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|title = The Bad Boy Makes Good|url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/04/08/the-bad-boy-makes-good/|website = Foreign Policy|date = 9 April 2011|first = Elizabeth|last = McAlister}}</ref>

==Political career==
In 1992, Martelly played for free at a protest against the arrival of a UN representative charged with negotiating the return of [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] after the [[1991 Haitian coup d'état]].<ref name=Miller/> Martelly later explained "I did not want Aristide back... You want me to be a de facto [supporter of the coup]. I'm a de facto. It's my right. It's my country. I can fight for whatever I believe in."<ref name=Miller/> After [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] had been restored to office, some former military officers, paramilitaries and secret police associated with the old regime were assassinated. In February 1995, a "hit list" of such individuals was circulated, and included Martelly's name. After an individual on the list was murdered, Martelly's wife warned him not to come back from his tour, and it was almost a year before he returned to Haiti.<ref name=Ackerman321/> During this time he released a song, ''Prezidan'', "an exuberant ditty that called for a president who played compas".<ref name=Ackerman321/> At the 1996 Carnival, to which [[Manno Charlemagne]], the mayor of Port-au-Prince, invited him, Martelly dressed in a pink wig and bra.<ref name=Ackerman321/> As Martelly explained, it was intended in part as a political statement: <blockquote>"If you see me as a [[Tontons Macoute|Macoute]], then I'm a Macoute. If you see me as gay, I'm gay. What you think of me is no problem, as far as I am concerned. You have the right to think what you want. I know who I am, and that's the main thing."<ref name=Ackerman321/></blockquote>

In 1997, Martelly participated in "Knowledge is Power", an [[HIV]] educational music video with a message about preventing the spread of HIV. His humanitarian work as the president of the Fondation Rose et Blanc, created by his wife Sophia and himself, to help the poor and disenfranchised of the country, was the basis for his choice as the Good Will Haitian Ambassador for the Protection of the Environment by the Haitian Government.

In 2004, following the [[2004 Haitian coup d'état]] against Aristide, [[Gérard Latortue]], a friend of Martelly's, became Prime Minister.<ref name=Miller/> At this time, Martelly was living in Florida but in 2007, he moved back to Haiti. In the process, when the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|mortgage/financial sector crashed]], he defaulted on more than $1m in loans, losing 3 properties to foreclosure.<ref name=Miller/>

Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]], Martelly ran for President of Haiti in the [[Haitian general election, 2010-11|general elections]]. He benefited from his celebrity status as a musician, and held musical rallies called koudjay (musical political endorsement rallies), drawing crowds and media attention.<ref name="auto"/> He also benefited from the support of [[Bill Clinton]] (UN Special Envoy to Haiti) and the active support of US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref name="KQ_Haiti">{{cite web |last1=Katz |first1=Jonathan |title=The King and Queen of Haiti |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/the-king-and-queen-of-haiti/ |website=Politico|date=4 May 2015|quote=[T]he government that Hillary Clinton helped put in power during that January 2011 trip—and that both Clintons have backed strongly since—has proven itself unworthy of that trust.}}</ref> He challenged the results as to whether he placed second, making the runoff, or third.

In 2015 an award-winning feature documentary, Sweet Micky for President was released. The film intimately chronicles Martelly's campaign journey as told through one of his first supporters, Pras Michel<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://massappeal.com/pras-ben-patterson-sweet-micky-for-president-interview/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120065628/https://massappeal.com/pras-ben-patterson-sweet-micky-for-president-interview/ |archive-date=20 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of the Fugees.

==Presidency==
After the devastating earthquake, Martelly was sworn in as [[President of Haiti]] on 14 May 2011, marking the first time in Haitian history that an incumbent president's peacefully transferred power to a member of the opposition. On the anniversary of the earthquake, the incumbent [[Prime Minister of Haiti|Haitian Prime Minister]], [[Jean-Max Bellerive]], resigned to allow Martelly to choose his own Prime Minister.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/05/15/2218209/haiti-prime-minister-jean-max.html Miami Herald, 15 May 2011]</ref> Martelly was quick to pledge reforms for the post-earthquake reconstruction process.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Haiti reconstruction desperately slow – Martelly – News|url = http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Haiti-reconstruction-desperately-slow---Martelly_8694993|website = Jamaica Observer|access-date = 19 January 2016|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160125053002/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Haiti-reconstruction-desperately-slow---Martelly_8694993|archivedate = 25 January 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

In August 2011, Martelly announced a plan to reinstate the nation's military. This plan was controversial as many human rights activists were concerned about the return of a military responsible for many atrocities in the past.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/27/haiti-disbanded-army_n_983964.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Haiti: Disbanded Army Reportedly To Be Restored | date=27 September 2011}}</ref>

In September 2011, Martelly formed an advisory board that included business executives, bankers, and politicians such as former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]], which he hoped would improve the economy .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Haiti-pres-Clinton-form-board-apf-2417127420.html?x=0&.v=2|title=Haiti pres, Clinton form board to court investors|date=9 September 2011|work=Yahoo Finance|access-date=17 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007104205/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Haiti-pres-Clinton-form-board-apf-2417127420.html?x=0&.v=2|archive-date=7 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In February 2012, Martelly's Prime Minister [[Garry Conille]] resigned after having been in office five months. He was replaced in May by [[Laurent Lamothe]], the Haitian Foreign Minister.

Between March and April 2012, Martelly was accused of corruption, with allegations that during and after the 2010 earthquake and presidential election, he had accepted $2.6 million in bribes to ensure that a [[Dominican Republic]] construction company would continue to receive contracts under his Presidency. Martelly denied the allegations.<ref>Ezra Fieser, ''[[TIME]]'', 14 April 2012, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2112023,00.html A Year Under Martelly: Corruption Controversy Sidetracks Haiti's Effort to Rebuild]</ref> Companies owned or controlled by [[Félix Bautista]] had received no-bid contracts worth $200 million, awarded by former Haitian Prime Minister [[Jean-Max Bellerive]].<ref>Ezra Fieser and Jacqueline Charles, ''[[Miami Herald]]'', 2 April 2012, [http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/04/02/2728451/dominican-authorities-investigating.html Dominican authorities investigating Haitian contracts of senator]</ref> In October 2013, Martelly met with a Franco-Polish arms dealer [[Pierre Dadak]] and two Canadian businessmen to discuss a $20 billion plan to develop [[Île-à-Vache]], a plan which came to nothing, but has the source of some controversy.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Belford |first1=Aubrey |last2=Ciesla |first2=Wojciech |last3=Gesina-Torres |first3=Endy |last4=Sarcevic |first4=Lejla |title=How a French Fraudster Climbed the World of International Arms Dealing |url=https://www.occrp.org/en/theatreofwar/how-a-french-fraudster-climbed-the-world-of-international-arms-dealing |accessdate=18 April 2020 |publisher=Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Unit |date=24 February 2018}}</ref>In November 2013, anti-government protests were held in the country over the high cost of living and corruption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/11/haiti-anti-government-protests-turn-violent-2013111944053271210.html|title=Haiti anti-government protests turn violent}}</ref>

Mid-term Senate elections had been originally due in May 2012, while the municipal poll was three years behind schedule.  They were again postponed on 26 October 2014—the day they were due to be held—because of an ongoing stalemate between the government and a group of opposition senators over an electoral law. The Haitian government faced months of protests over the delayed elections. Haitian Prime Minister [[Laurent Lamothe]] resigned on 14 December and was replaced by [[Evans Paul]]. But street protests continued, with renewed calls for the president's resignation.

On 13 January 2015, the parliament was dissolved after its term expired and four days later, thousands of protesters in [[Port-au-Prince]] again demanded the president's resignation. Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowd. Martelly urged protesters to respect public order and said he had reached a deal with the opposition to form a consensus government within the next 48 hours.<ref>BBC [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30859928 Haiti: New calls for Martelly to resign as deal is announced]</ref> New election dates were announced in March 2015, both for [[Haitian Parliament|parliament]] and for president.

On 9 August 2015, [[2015 Haitian parliamentary election|the first election]] Haiti had under President Michel Martelly took place. The citizens voted in the first round to fill two-thirds of the 30-member [[Senate (Haiti)|Senate]] and the entire 119-member [[Chamber of Deputies (Haiti)|Chamber of Deputies]]. In the capital, groups of young men ripped up paper ballots as heavily armed police shot into the air to re-establish order. Rocks were thrown in response before authorities closed the polling station. Local media reported the closure of numerous polling places in other parts of the country and scattered arrests of people accused of voting more than once. 54 polling stations, roughly 5 percent of the total, were closed amid violence and other disruptions. The first round of Haiti's presidential election was scheduled for 25 October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/08/09/disorder-rife-as-haitians-vote-in-long-delayed-elections|title=Disorder as Haitians vote in long-delayed elections – US News|work=US News & World Report}}</ref>

After the preliminary results were published on 25 October 2015, Jude Célestin said he did not recognize them. His criticism was joined by five other presidential candidates. They issued a joint statement denouncing the results as "anti-democratic" and called for the people's vote to be respected.
