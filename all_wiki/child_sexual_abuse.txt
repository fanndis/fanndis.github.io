A 1998 [[Rind et al. controversy|meta-analysis by Bruce Rind et al.]] generated controversy by suggesting that child sexual abuse does not always cause pervasive harm, that girls were more likely to be psychologically harmed than boys, that some college students reported such encounters as positive experiences and that the extent of psychological damage depends on whether or not the child described the encounter as "consensual."<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/00224499709551891 |title=A meta-analytic review of findings from national samples on psychological correlates of child sexual abuse |year=1997 |last1=Rind |first1=Bruce |last2=Tromovitch |first2=Philip |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=34 |pages=237–255|issue=3}}</ref> The study was criticized for flawed methodology and conclusions.<ref name="LC Dallam">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Dallam SJ, Gleaves DH, Cepeda-Benito A, Silberg JL, Kraemer HC, Spiegel D | title=The effects of child sexual abuse: Comment on Rind, Tromovitch, and Bauserman (1998) |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=127 |issue=6 |pages=715–33 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11726068 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.6.715}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Oltmanns |first1=Thomas F. |last2=Emery |first2=Robert E. |title=Abnormal Psychology |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2001 |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=978-0-13-187521-0}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The US Congress condemned the study for its conclusions and for providing material used by pedophile organizations to justify their activities.<ref name="congress">{{cite web|author=US Congress|year=1999|title=Whereas no segment of our society is more critical to the future of human survival than our children|work=106th Congress, Resolution 107|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&docid=f:hc107enr.txt.pdf}}</ref>

===Commercial sexual exploitation===
{{Main|Commercial sexual exploitation of children}}

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) is defined by the Declaration of the First World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm in 1996, as "sexual abuse by an adult accompanied by remuneration in cash or in kind to the child or third person(s)."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/eapro/Fact_sheet_SexualExploitation.pdf|title=UNICEF|website=unicef.org}}</ref> CSEC usually takes the form of [[child prostitution]] or [[child pornography]], and is often facilitated by [[child sex tourism]]. CSEC is particularly a problem in developing countries of [[Asia]].<ref>[http://www.unescap.org/pmd/documents/me/Sexual%20abuse.pdf Unescap.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222151144/http://www.unescap.org/pmd/documents/me/Sexual%20abuse.pdf |date=February 22, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rosa/commercial.pdf|title=UNICEF|website=unicef.org}}</ref> In recent years, new innovations in technology have facilitated the trade of Internet child pornography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/eapro/activities_3757.html|title=What we do – Commercial sexual exploitation of children|work=unicef.org|access-date=23 March 2015}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the term ''child sexual exploitation'' covers any form of sexual abuse which includes an exchange of a resource for sexual activity with a child.<ref name="Williams discussion" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=DFE |title=Child sexual exploitation Definition and a guide for practitioners, local leaders and decision makers working to protect children from child sexual exploitation |date=February 2017 }}</ref> Prior to 2009, the term commonly used to describe child sexual exploitation was ''child prostitution''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Phoenix |first1=Jo |title=Out of place: The policing and criminalisation of sexually exploited girls and young women. |date=2012 |publisher=The Howard League for Penal Reform |location=London |url=https://howardleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Out-of-place.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Hallet |first1=Sophie |title=Making sense of child sexual exploitation: exchange, abuse and children and young people. |date=2017 |publisher=Policy Press |location=Bristol }}</ref> The term ''child sexual exploitation'' first appeared in government guidance in 2009 as part of an attempt to promote an understanding that children involved in exploitation were victims of abuse rather than criminals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=DCSF |title=Safeguarding Children and Young People from Sexual Exploitation |date=2009 |url=http://www.haringeylscb.org/sites/haringeylscb/files/safeguarding_cpy_from_sexual_exploitation_1_.pdf |access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref><ref name="Words Matter">{{cite book |last1=Beckett |first1=Helen |last2=Walker |first2=Joanna |editor-last1=Beckett |editor-first1=Helen |editor-last2=Pearce |editor-first2=Jenny |title=Understanding and Responding to Child Sexual Exploitation |publisher=Routledge |location=London |pages=9–23 |date=2018 |chapter=Words Matter}}</ref> Because early definitions of child sexual exploitation were created to foster a move away from use of the term ''child prostitution'', the concept of exchange, which made child sexual exploitation different from child sexual abuse, referred to financial gain only. However, in the years since the birth of the concept of child sexual exploitation, the notion of exchange has been widened to include other types of gain, including love, acquisition of status and protection from harm.<ref name="Words Matter"/>

The [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] provides guidelines for what to say to the victim and what to do following the disclosure.<ref>[http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/responding_to_child_sexual_abuse "Responding To Child Sexual Abuse." ''American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry''.]</ref> Asa Don Brown has indicated: "A minimization of the trauma and its effects is commonly injected into the picture by parental caregivers to shelter and calm the child. It has been commonly assumed that focusing on children’s issues too long will negatively impact their recovery. Therefore, the parental caregiver teaches the child to mask his or her issues."<ref>Brown, Asa Don, "The effects of childhood trauma on adult perception and worldview". (Dissertation) Capella University, 2008, 152 pages. AAT 3297512. {{ISBN|978-0-549-47057-1}}; Publication #3297512.{{page needed|date=November 2013}}</ref>

In many jurisdictions, abuse that is suspected, not necessarily proven, requires reporting to [[child protection]] agencies, such as the [[Child Protection Services]] in the United States. Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as [[primary care provider]]s and [[nurse]]s, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child's immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child that he or she has done the right thing by telling and that they are not bad and that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information. [[Anatomically correct doll]]s are sometimes used to help explain what happened, although some researchers consider the dolls too explicit and overstimulating, which might contribute to non-abused children behaving with the dolls in one or more ways that suggest they were sexually abused.<ref name="Segal">{{cite book|authors=Daniel L. Segal, Michel Hersen|title=Diagnostic Interviewing|publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]]|isbn=978-1441913203|year=2009|page=455|access-date=November 23, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfDRjsei03kC&pg=PA455}}</ref>  For the suspected abusers, it is also recommended to use a nonjudgmental, nonthreatening attitude towards them and to withhold expressing shock, in order to help disclose information.<ref>Wilson, S.F.W, Giddens, J.F.G. (2009) Health Assessment for Nursing Practice. St. Louis: Mosby Elsevier, page 506.</ref>

==Treatment==
The initial approach to treating a person who has been a victim of sexual abuse is dependent upon several important factors:
*Age at the time of presentation
*Circumstances of presentation for treatment
*Co-morbid conditions

The goal of treatment is not only to treat current mental health issues, and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] related symptoms, but also to prevent future ones.

===Children and adolescents===
Children often present for treatment in one of several circumstances, including criminal investigations, custody battles, problematic behaviors, and referrals from child welfare agencies.<ref name=NCCAN>{{Cite book|author1=Cynthia Winn |author2=Anthony J. Urquiza |title=Treatment For Abused And Neglected Children: Infancy To Age 18 – User Manual Series |publisher=Diane Pub Co |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7881-1661-2 }}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}</ref>

The three major modalities for therapy with children and adolescents are [[family therapy]], [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]], and [[psychotherapy|individual therapy]]. Which course is used depends on a variety of factors that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For instance, treatment of young children generally requires strong parental involvement and can benefit from family therapy. Adolescents tend to be more independent; they can benefit from individual or group therapy. The modality also shifts during the course of treatment; for example, group therapy is rarely used in the initial stages, as the subject matter is very personal and/or embarrassing.<ref name=NCCAN/> In a 2012 systematic review, [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavior therapy]] showed potential in treating the adverse consequences of child sexual abuse.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=G|first1=Macdonald|last2=Jp|first2=Higgins|last3=P|first3=Ramchandani|last4=Jc|first4=Valentine|last5=Lp|first5=Bronger|last6=P|first6=Klein|last7=R|first7=O'Daniel|last8=M|first8=Pickering|last9=B|first9=Rademaker|date=2012-05-16|title=Cognitive-behavioural Interventions for Children Who Have Been Sexually Abused|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=5|pages=CD001930|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001930.pub3|pmc=7061273|pmid=22592679}}</ref>

Major factors that affect both the pathology and response to treatment include the type and severity of the sexual act, its frequency, the age at which it occurred, and the child's family of origin.  Roland C. Summit, a medical doctor, defined the different stages the victims of child sexual abuse go through, called [[child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome]]. He suggested that children who are victims of sexual abuse display a range of symptoms that include secrecy, helplessness, entrapment, accommodation, delayed and conflicted disclosure and recantation.<ref name="Summit">{{cite journal|last=Summit|first=Roland C.|title=The child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|date=January 1983|volume=7|issue=22|pmid=6605796|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(83)90070-4|pages=177–93}}</ref>

===Adults===
Adults who have been sexually abused as children often present for treatment with a secondary mental health issue, which can include [[substance abuse]], [[eating disorders]], [[personality disorders]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and conflict in romantic or interpersonal relationships.<ref name="Swaby-">{{Cite journal| last1 = Swaby | first1 = AN. | last2 = Morgan | first2 = KA. | title = The relationship between childhood sexual abuse and sexual dysfunction in Jamaican adults | journal = J Child Sex Abuse | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–66 | year =  2009| doi =  10.1080/10538710902902679| pmid = 19856732 | s2cid = 33062149 }}</ref>

Generally, the approach is to focus on the present problem, rather than the abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the person's specific issues. For instance, a person with a history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. However, there is often an emphasis on [[cognitive restructuring]] due to the deep-seated nature of the trauma. Some newer techniques such as [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]] (EMDR) have been shown to be effective.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Edmond | first1 = T. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = A. | title = Assessing the long-term effects of EMDR: results from an 18-month follow-up study with adult female survivors of CSA | journal = J Child Sex Abuse | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–86 | year = 2004 | doi =  10.1300/J070v13n01_04| pmid = 15353377 | s2cid = 28012364 }}</ref>

Although there is no known cure for pedophilia,<ref name=SetoReview>{{cite journal | author = Seto MC | year = 2009 | title = Pedophilia | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 5 | pages = 391–407 | doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.032408.153618 | pmid=19327034}}</ref> there are [[Pedophilia#Treatment|a number of treatments for pedophiles and child sexual abusers]]. Some of the treatments focus on attempting to change the sexual preference of pedophiles, while others focus on keeping pedophiles from committing child sexual abuse, or on keeping child sexual abusers from committing child sexual abuse again. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), for example, aims to reduce attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that may increase the likelihood of sexual offenses against children. Its content varies widely between therapists, but a typical program might involve training in self-control, social competence and empathy, and use [[cognitive restructuring]] to change views on sex with children. The most common form of this therapy is [[relapse prevention]], where the patient is taught to identify and respond to potentially risky situations based on principles used for treating addictions.<ref name="seto171">{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|page= 171}}</ref>

The evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy is mixed.<ref name="seto171" /> A 2012 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane Review]] of randomized trials found that CBT had no effect on risk of reoffending for contact sex offenders.<ref name="cochrane">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dennis JA, Khan O, Ferriter M, Huband N, Powney MJ, Duggan C | year = 2012 | title = Psychological interventions for adults who have sexually offended or are at risk of offending | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = CD007507 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007507.pub2| pmid = 23235646 }}</ref> Meta-analyses in 2002 and 2005, which included both randomized and non-randomized studies, concluded that CBT reduced recidivism.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lösel F, Schmucker M | year = 2005 | title = The effectiveness of treatment for sexual offenders: a comprehensive meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Experimental Criminology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 117–46 | doi=10.1007/s11292-004-6466-7| s2cid = 145253074 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hanson RK, Gordon A, Harris AJ, Marques JK, Murphy W, etal | year = 2002 | title = First report of the collaborative outcome data project on the effectiveness of treatment for sex offenders | journal = Sexual Abuse | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–94 | doi=10.1177/107906320201400207| pmid = 11961890 | s2cid = 34192852 }}</ref> There is debate over whether non-randomized studies should be considered informative.<ref name=SetoReview/><ref name="rice2012">{{cite book |vauthors=Rice ME, Harris GT | year = 2012 | chapter = Treatment for adult sex offenders: may we reject the null hypothesis? | title = Handbook of Legal & Ethical Aspects of Sex Offender Treatment & Management |veditors=Harrison K, Rainey B | location = London | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell}}</ref> More research is needed.<ref name="cochrane" />

Sexual abuse is associated with many sub-clinical behavioral issues as well, including [[re-victimization]] in the teenage years, a bipolar-like switching between sexual compulsion and shut-down, and [[cognitive distortion|distorted thinking]] on the subject of sexual abuse (for instance, that it is common and happens to everyone).  When first presenting for treatment, the patient can be fully aware of their abuse as an event, but their ''appraisal'' of it is often distorted, such as believing that the event was unremarkable (a form of [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]]). Frequently, victims do not make the connection between their abuse and their present pathology.

===Typology===
Early research in the 1970s and 1980s began to classify offenders based on their motivations and traits. Groth and Birnbaum (1978) categorized child sexual offenders into two groups, "fixated" and "regressed".<ref name="Groth">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01542377 |title=Adult sexual orientation and attraction to underage persons |year=1978 |last1=Groth |first1=A. Nicholas |last2=Birnbaum |first2=H. Jean |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=175–81 |pmid=666571|s2cid=11477434 }}</ref> Fixated were described as having a primary attraction to children, whereas regressed had largely maintained relationships with other adults, and were even married. This study also showed that adult [[sexual orientation]] was not related to the sex of the victim targeted, e.g. men who molested boys often had adult relationships with women.<ref name="Groth"/>

Later work (Holmes and Holmes, 2002) expanded on the types of offenders and their psychological profiles.  They are divided as follows:<ref name="holmes">{{Cite book| last = Holmes | first = Ronald M. |author2=Holmes, Stephen T.  | title =Profiling Violent Crimes: An Investigative Tool  | publisher = Sage Publications, Inc | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | date = 2002-03-12 |  isbn = 978-0-7619-2593-4}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}</ref>
*Situational – does not prefer children, but offend under certain conditions.
**''Regressed'' – Typically has relationships with adults, but a stressor causes them to seek children as a substitute.
**''Morally Indiscriminate'' – All-around sexual deviant, who may commit other sexual offenses unrelated to children.
**''Naive/Inadequate'' – Often mentally disabled in some way, finds children less threatening.
*Preferential – has true sexual interest in children.
**''Mysoped'' – Sadistic and violent, target strangers more often than acquaintances.
**''Fixated'' – Little or no activity with own age, described as an "overgrown child".

===Causal factors===
Causal factors of child sex offenders are not known conclusively.<ref name=psychtoday2008>{{cite web |url=http://psychologytoday.com/conditions/pedophilia.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080219104453/http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/pedophilia.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 February 2008 |title=Pedophilia |publisher=Sussex Publishers, LLC |work=Psychology Today |date=7 September 2006 |access-date=9 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The experience of sexual abuse as a child was previously thought to be a strong risk factor, but research does not show a causal relationship, as the vast majority of sexually abused children do not grow up to be adult offenders, nor do the majority of adult offenders report childhood sexual abuse. The US [[Government Accountability Office]] concluded, "the existence of a cycle of sexual abuse was not established." Before 1996, there was greater belief in the theory of a "cycle of violence", because most of the research done was retrospective—abusers were asked if they had experienced past abuse. Even the majority of studies found that most adult sex offenders said they had ''not'' been sexually abused during childhood, but studies varied in terms of their estimates of the percentage of such offenders who had been abused, from 0 to 79 percent. More recent prospective [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] research—studying children with documented cases of sexual abuse over time to determine what percentage become adult offenders—has demonstrated that the cycle of violence theory is not an adequate explanation for why people molest children.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cycle of Sexual Abuse: Research Inconclusive About Whether Child Victims Become Adult Abusers|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1996/gg96178.pdf|work= US Government Accountability Office General Government Division United States|author1=E L Rezmovic |author2=D Sloane |author3=D Alexander |author4=B Seltser |author5=T Jessor |year=1996}}</ref>

===Pedophilia===
{{Main|Pedophilia}}
Pedophilia is a condition in which an adult or older adolescent is primarily or exclusively attracted to prepubescent children, whether the attraction is acted upon or not.<ref>World Health Organization, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10. § F65.4</ref><ref>American Psychiatric Association (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition text revision), § 302.2</ref> A person with this attraction is called a ''pedophile''.

In [[Police|law enforcement]], the term ''pedophile'' is sometimes used to describe those accused or convicted of child sexual abuse under [[Minor (law)|sociolegal definitions of ''child'']] (including both prepubescent children and adolescents younger than the local [[age of consent]]);<ref name="ames">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01541928 |title=Legal, social, and biological definitions of pedophilia |year=1990 |last1=Ames |first1=M.

One study found that 42% of offenders re-offended (either a sex crime, violent crime, or both) after they were released.

Significant underreporting of sexual abuse of boys by both women and men is believed to occur due to sex stereotyping, social denial, the minimization of male victimization, and the relative lack of research on sexual abuse of boys.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb00862.x | last1 = Watkins | first1 = B. | last2 = Bentovim | first2 = A. | year = 1992 | title = The sexual abuse of male children and adolescents: a review of current research | url = http://www.sasian.org/papers/boysngirls.htm | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology & Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 10| pages = 197–248 | pmid=1737828}}</ref> Sexual victimization of boys by their mothers or other female relatives is especially rarely researched or reported.

In the United Kingdom, reported child sex abuse has increased, but this may be due to greater willingness to report.  Police need more resources to deal with it.  Also parents and schools need to give children and adolescents regular advice about how to spot abuse and about the need to report abuse.  Software providers are urged to do more to police their environment and make it safe for children.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/29/estimated-20000-british-men-interested-in-sexually-abusing-children-police-chief-says Estimated 20,000 British men interested in sexually abusing children] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

The United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) is an international [[treaty]] that legally obliges states to protect children's rights.  Articles 34 and 35 of the CRC require states to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. This includes outlawing the coercion of a child to perform sexual activity, the [[prostitution of children]], and the [[child pornography|exploitation of children in creating pornography]]. States are also required to prevent the abduction, sale, or trafficking of children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htm|title=unhchr.ch|website=www.unhchr.ch}}</ref>  As of November 2008, 193 countries are bound by the CRC,<ref name=untreaty>United Nations Treaty Collection.

The Council of Europe has adopted the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] in order to prohibit child sexual abuse that occurs within home or family.

In the [[European Union]], child sexual abuse is subject to a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]].<ref>DIRECTIVE 2011/92/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:335:0001:0014:EN:PDF Eur-lex.europa.eu]</ref> This directive deals with several forms of sexual abuse of children, especially [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]].

==History==
Child sexual abuse has gained public attention in the past few decades and has become one of the most high-profile crimes. While sexual use of children by adults has been present throughout history, public interest in prevention has tended to fluctuate.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://tif.ssrc.org/2012/07/13/placing-childhood-sexual-abuse-in-historical-perspective/|title=Placing childhood sexual abuse in historical perspective – The Immanent Frame|last=Mintz|first=Steven|website=tif.ssrc.org|access-date=2018-01-29|date=2012-07-13}}</ref> Initially, concern centered around children under the age of ten, but over time, advocates have attracted attention toward the sexual abuse of children between the ages of 11 to 17.<ref name=":0" /> Up until the 1930s, the psychological impact of sexual abuse was not emphasized, instead emphasis was placed on the physical harm or the child's reputation.<ref name=":0" /> Widespread public awareness of children's sexual abuse did not occur until the 1970s in the West.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conte|first=Jon|date=1994|title=Child Sexual Abuse: Awareness and Backlash|url=https://www.princeton.edu/futureofchildren/publications/docs/04_02_11.pdf|journal=The Future of Children|volume=4|issue=2|pages=224–225|doi=10.2307/1602532|jstor=1602532|pmid=7804765|access-date=2018-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815035025/http://www.princeton.edu/futureofchildren/publications/docs/04_02_11.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Early writings===
The first published work dedicated specifically to child sexual abuse appeared in France in 1857: ''Medical-Legal Studies of Sexual Assault'' ''(Etude Médico-Légale sur les Attentats aux Mœurs)'', by [[Auguste Ambroise Tardieu]], the noted French pathologist and pioneer of [[forensic medicine]].<ref>{{cite book  | last = Masson   | pages = 15–25 |first =  Jeffrey Moussaieff  | author-link = Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson  | title = Assault on the Truth  | publisher = Farrar Straus  | year = 1984  | location = New York  | isbn = 978-0-374-10642-3  }}</ref>

===Public concern===
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=October 2015}}
Child sexual abuse became a public issue in the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to this point in time, sexual abuse remained rather secretive and socially unspeakable.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Studies on child molestation were nonexistent until the 1920s and the first national estimate of the number of child sexual abuse cases was published in 1948. By 1968 44 out of 50 U.S. states had enacted mandatory laws that required physicians to report cases of suspicious child abuse. Legal action began to become more prevalent in the 1970s with the enactment of the [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] in 1974 in conjunction with the creation of the National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect. Since the creation of the Child Abuse and Treatment Act, reported child abuse cases have increased dramatically.  Finally, the [[National Abuse Coalition]] was created in 1979 to create pressure in congress to create more sexual abuse laws.

[[Second wave feminism]] brought greater awareness of child sexual abuse and [[violence against women]], and made them public, political issues.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Reavey | first1 = Paula | last2 = Warner | first2 = Sam | contribution = Introduction | editor-last1 = Reavey | editor-first1 = Paula | editor-last2 = Warner | editor-first2 = Sam | title = New feminist stories of child sexual abuse: sexual scripts and dangerous dialogues | page = 2 | publisher = New York Routledge | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415259446 | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=obHkvCPnos0C&pg=PA2 Preview.]</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Valentich | first = Mary | contribution = Feminist theory and social work practice (child sexual abuse) | editor-last = Turner | editor-first = Francis J. | title = Social work treatment: interlocking theoretical approaches | page = 215 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780195394658 | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_k8Aptn6tEC&pg=PA215 Preview.]</ref> [[Judith Lewis Herman]], Harvard professor of psychiatry, wrote the first book ever on father-daughter incest when she discovered during her medical residency that a large number of the women she was seeing had been victims of father-daughter incest.

In 1986, Congress passed the [[Child Abuse Victims' Rights Act]], giving children a civil claim in sexual abuse cases. The number of laws created in the 1980s and 1990s began to create greater prosecution and detection of child sexual abusers. During the 1970s a large transition began in the legislature related to child sexual abuse. [[Megan's Law]] which was enacted in 1996 gives the public access to knowledge of sex offenders nationwide.<ref name=wright>{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Ph.D Richard G.|title=Sex offender laws : failed policies, new directions|date=2014|publisher=Springer Publishing Co Inc|isbn=9780826196712|pages=50–65|edition=Second|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms75AwAAQBAJ}}</ref>

Anne Hastings described these changes in attitudes towards child sexual abuse as "the beginning of one of history's largest social revolutions."<ref>''From Generation to Generation: Understanding Sexual Attraction to Children'', p.15</ref>

According to John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor B.J. Cling,

<blockquote>"By the early 21st century, the issue of child sexual abuse has become a legitimate focus of professional attention, while increasingly separated from second wave feminism...As child sexual abuse becomes absorbed into the larger field of interpersonal trauma studies, child sexual abuse studies and intervention strategies have become degendered and largely unaware of their political origins in modern feminism and other vibrant political movements of the 1970s. One may hope that unlike in the past, this rediscovery of child sexual abuse that began in the 70s will not again be followed by collective amnesia. The institutionalization of child maltreatment interventions in federally funded centers, national and international societies, and a host of research studies (in which the United States continues to lead the world) offers grounds for cautious optimism. Nevertheless, as Judith Herman argues cogently, 'The systematic study of psychological trauma...depends on the support of a political movement.'"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sexualized Violence Against Women and Children: A Psychology and Law Perspective|author=B.J. Cling|page=177|year=2004|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-061-6}}</ref> </blockquote>

===Civil lawsuits===
In the United States growing awareness of child sexual abuse has sparked an increasing number of civil [[lawsuits]] for [[monetary damages]] stemming from such incidents.  Increased awareness of child sexual abuse has encouraged more victims to come forward, whereas in the past victims often kept their abuse secret. Some states have enacted specific [[laws]] lengthening the applicable [[statutes of limitations]] so as to allow victims of child sexual abuse to file suit sometimes years after they have reached the age of majority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/state-civil-statutes-of-limitations-in-child-sexua.aspx|title=State Civil Statutes of Limitations in Child Sexual Abuse Cases|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref>  Such lawsuits can be brought where a person or entity, such as a school, church or youth organization, or daycare was charged with supervising the child but failed to do so with child sexual abuse resulting, making the individual or institution liable.  In the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]] the various [[Roman Catholic]] Diocese in the [[United States]] have paid out approximately $1 billion settling hundreds of such lawsuits since the early 1990s.  There have also been lawsuits involving the American [[Christian right|Religious Right]].  Crimes have allegedly gone unreported and victims were pressured into silence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/25/1211671/-The-Church-Child-Sex-Abuse-Scandal-Widens-and-Deepens|title=The Church Child Sex Abuse Scandal Widens and Deepens|work=dailykos.com|access-date=23 March 2015}}</ref>
As lawsuits can involve demanding procedures there is a concern that [[children]] or adults who file suit will be re-victimized by defendants through the [[legal process]], much as [[rape]] victims can be re-victimized by the accused in [[criminal]] rape trials.  The child sexual abuse plaintiff's attorney [[Thomas A. Cifarelli]] has written that children involved in the legal system, particularly victims of sexual abuse and molestation, should be afforded certain procedural safeguards to protect them from harassment during the legal process.<ref>Cifarelli, T.A.,''Shielding Minors'', Los Angeles Daily Journal, (October 10, 2001).</ref>

In June 2008 in [[Zambia]] the issue of teacher-student sexual abuse and sexual assault was brought to the attention of the High Court of Zambia where a landmark case decision, with presiding Judge Philip Musonda, awarded $45million Zambian kwacha (US$13,000) to the plaintiff, a 13-year-old girl for sexual abuse and rape by her school teacher. This claim was brought against her teacher as a "person of authority" who, as Judge Musonda stated, "had a moral superiority (responsibility) over his students" at the time.<ref>[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/08/11/rapecasezambia-articl804/ "When A Girl Student Stands Up and Wins"], ''Women News Network'' – WNN, August 11, 2008</ref>

A 2000 World Health Organization – Geneva report, “World Report on Violence and Health (Chap 6 – Sexual Violence)” states, “Action in schools is vital for reducing sexual and other forms of violence. In many countries a sexual relation between a teacher and a pupil is not a serious disciplinary offence and policies on sexual harassment in schools either do not exist or are not implemented. In recent years, though, some countries have introduced laws prohibiting sexual relations between teachers and pupils. Such measures are important in helping eradicate sexual harassment in schools. At the same time, a wider range of actions is also needed, including changes to teacher training and recruitment and reforms of curricula, so as to transform gender relations in schools.”<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf World Health Organization Report on Sexual Violence], 2002</ref>
