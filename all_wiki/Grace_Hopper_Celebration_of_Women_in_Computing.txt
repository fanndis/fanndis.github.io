'''The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing''' ('''GHC''') is a series of conferences designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. It is the world's largest gathering of women in computing. The celebration, named after computer scientist [[Grace Hopper]], is organized by the [[Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. The 2020 conference was held virtually at the end of September 2020 due to the [[COVID-19_pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ghc.anitab.org|title=An Exciting Announcement about GHC 20!|work=Grace Hopper Celebration|access-date=2020-05-03|language=en-US}}</ref> 

==History==
In 1994, [[Anita Borg]] and [[Telle Whitney]] founded the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. With the initial idea of creating a conference by and for women computer scientists, Borg and Whitney met over dinner, with a blank sheet of paper, having no idea how to start a conference, and started to plan out their vision. The first Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing was held in Washington, D.C., in June 1994, and brought together 500 technical women.<ref name="biogvid">{{cite web|title=Anita Borg Celebration: Changing the World for Women and Technology|url=https://www.youtube.com/abiwt#p/c/71607DB3B12823E9/2/resEXQgcaJo|work=Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=22 June 2011|date=14 June 2011}}</ref> More than a dozen conferences have been held from 1994 to the present; the second was held in 1997 and the conference has been held annually since 2006.<ref name="2008ghc">{{cite web|last=Colborn|first=Kate|title=2008 Grace Hopper Celebration: "We build a better world"|url=http://www.diversitycareers.com/articles/pro/08-decjan/soc_news_grace_hopper.htm|work=Diversity/Careers|publisher=Diversity/Careers|accessdate=29 June 2011|date=December 2008 – January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928005121/http://www.diversitycareers.com/articles/pro/08-decjan/soc_news_grace_hopper.htm|archivedate=28 September 2011}}</ref> The sold-out 2010 conference attracted 2,147 attendees from 29 countries.

==Criticisms==
The GHC conference has been criticized for a lack of diversity, particularly racial diversity,<ref name="Dickey">{{cite news |last1=Dickey |first1=Megan Rose |title=Grace Hopper organizers struggle to practice the diversity they advocate |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/anita-borg-institute-grace-hopper-diversity/ |accessdate=10 June 2020 |publisher=TechCrunch |date=20 October 2016}}</ref> and financial inaccessibility due to the high cost of attendance.<ref name="Mashable">{{cite news |last1=Hinchliffe |first1=Emma |title=The energy at the Grace Hopper Celebration is enough to make you less cynical about tech |url=https://mashable.com/2017/10/10/grace-hopper-celebration-women-tech-2017/ |accessdate=10 June 2020 |publisher=Mashable |date=10 October 2017}}</ref><ref name="Muthukumar">{{cite news |last1=Muthukumar |first1=Raksha |title=The case against Grace Hopper Celebration |url=https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/the-case-against-grace-hopper-celebration/ |accessdate=10 June 2020 |publisher=TechCrunch |date=12 November 2019}}</ref> In 2019, the cost of registration, not including hotel, transportation, or other costs, was $450 for students, $600 for academics, and $1,150 for general registration.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 FAQ |url=https://ghc.anitab.org/2019-faq/#:~:text=General%20Registration%20is%20%241150.,group%20of%20people%20for%20GHC. |website=Grace Hopper Celebration |publisher=AnitaB.org |accessdate=10 June 2020}}</ref>

In 2015, GHC faced criticism, including from engineer [[Erica Baker]], when two white men and zero black women were featured as "headline" speakers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Erica Joy |title=#FFFFFF Diversity |url=https://medium.com/this-is-hard/ffffff-diversity-1bd2b3421e8a |website=Medium |accessdate=10 June 2020 |date=7 October 2015}}</ref> The organization responded by targeting more diversity in speakers and collecting race and ethnicity data at the following year's event.<ref>{{cite web |title=GHC 16: Reflecting Our Community’s Diversity |url=https://ghc.anitab.org/news/commentary-perspectives/ghc-16-communitys-diversity/ |website=Grace Hopper Celebration |publisher=AnitaB.org |accessdate=10 June 2020}}</ref>

GHC does not pay its speakers. In past years GHC required speakers to purchase their own conference ticket, but as of 2020, speakers receive complimentary registration. (In the case of two selected poster presenters, only one will receive complimentary registration.) Speakers are not paid and travel and hotel expenses are not covered.<ref name="GHC 20 Speakers FAQ">{{cite web |title=GHC 20 Speakers FAQ |url=https://ghc.anitab.org/2020-speakers/speakers-faq/ |website=Grace Hopper Celebration |publisher=AnitaB.org |accessdate=10 June 2020}}</ref> The "pay to speak" approach has been criticized by people including author and software engineer [[Gayle Laakmann McDowell]].<ref name="Laakmann McDowell">{{cite web |last1=Laakman McDowell |first1=Gayle |title=Why I Won’t Be Speaking at the Grace Hopper Conference |url=https://medium.com/@gayle/why-i-won-t-be-speaking-at-grace-hopper-2071df640fc2 |website=Medium |accessdate=10 June 2020 |date=29 February 2016}}</ref>
