'''Alan Gabriel Ludwig García Pérez''' ({{IPA-es|ˈalaŋ ɡaβˈɾjel luðˈwiɣ ɡaɾˈsi.a ˈpeɾes}}; 23 May 1949 – 17 April 2019) was a Peruvian politician who served as [[President of Peru]] from 1985 to 1990 and from 2006 to 2011.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110202075344/http://english.aljazeera.net// García wins to become Peru president] [[Al-Jazeera]], 5 June 2006</ref> He was the second leader of the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|Peruvian Aprista Party]] and the only party member ever to have served as [[List of Presidents of Peru|President]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coha.org/welcome-mr-peruvian-president-why-alan-garcia-is-no-hero-to-his-people/|title=Welcome, Mr. Peruvian President: Why Alan García is no hero to his people|date=2 June 2010|website=[[Council on Hemispheric Affairs]]|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418150551/http://www.coha.org/welcome-mr-peruvian-president-why-alan-garcia-is-no-hero-to-his-people/|archive-date=18 April 2019|url-status=live|access-date=2019-04-18|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Mentored by the founder of the APRA, [[Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre]], he served in the [[Constituent Assembly of Peru|Constituent Assembly of 1978–1979]] presided over by his leader, which drafted the Constitution of 1979. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1980, he quickly rose as the long-term successor to Haya, becoming party Secretary General in 1982. He was elected to the Presidency in the [[1985 Peruvian general election|1985 general election]] with 53% of the popular vote.

His first presidential term was marked by a severe economic crisis, social unrest and violence. He ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in [[2001 Peruvian general election|2001]], losing in a run-off to [[Alejandro Toledo]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/node/18486281|title=The risk of throwing it all away|journal=The Economist|accessdate=10 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310201638/https://www.economist.com/node/18486281|archive-date=10 March 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all|date=2011-03-31}}</ref> In [[2006 Peruvian general election|2006]], he was elected to the presidency for a second term. Throughout Garcia's second term, Peru experienced a steady economy, becoming the fastest growing country in Latin America in 2008, surpassing China in terms of rising GDP. The economic success of his presidency would be acclaimed by world leaders as a triumph, as poverty was reduced from 48% to 28% nationally. During his presidency, Peru signed [[free trade]] agreements with the United States and China, but Garcia was also accused of corruption. He was succeeded by his former 2006 run-off rival [[Ollanta Humala]] in 2011. He withdrew from party politics after failing to advance to the second round of the [[2016 Peruvian general election|2016 general election]], placing fifth in his bid for a record third term as president as the candidate of the heavily-criticized [[Popular Alliance (Peru)|Popular Alliance]] coalition between his party and the [[centre-right]] [[Christian People's Party (Peru)|Christian People's Party]], which included former rival [[Lourdes Flores]] as his first running mate.<ref>https://busquedas.elperuano.pe/normaslegales/inscriben-a-la-alianza-electoral-alianza-popular-en-el-reg-resolucion-no-004-2016-dnropjne-1330546-1/</ref>

García became the second head of state of Peru to die of suicide after [[Gustavo Jiménez]], who did so in 1933.

García is considered one of the most controversial yet talented politicians of Peru's contemporary history.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/17/peru-alan-garcia-ex-president-shoots-himself-critical-condition|title=Alan García: former Peru president dies after shooting himself before arrest|work=The Guardian|date=17 April 2019|accessdate=30 June 2020|first1=Tom|last1=Phillips|first2=Dan |last2=Collyns}}</ref> He was known as an immensely charismatic orator.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-peru-garcia/perus-former-leader-garcias-political-life-at-risk-over-pardons-idUSBRE93H0YL20130418|title=Peru's former leader Garcia's political life at risk over pardons|work=Reuters|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=30 June 2020|first=Marco|last=Aquino}}</ref>

==Early life==
Born in the Maison de Santé Clinic of the [[Barranco District]] into a middle-class family, García met his father for the first time when he was five due to his father's imprisonment for being a member of the [[Peruvian Aprista Party]].<ref name=bioES>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/g/garcia_alan.htm|title=Biografia de Alan García|website=www.biografiasyvidas.com|access-date=2019-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417191744/https://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/g/garcia_alan.htm|archive-date=2019-04-17|url-status=live}}</ref> His mother founded the party's base in the [[Camaná Province]] of the [[Arequipa Region]].

At 14, he was already an immensely talented [[orator]] when he first gave a speech in honour of party founder [[Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre]], whom he admired and followed until his death.<ref name=bioES/>

García studied law, first at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]] -although the official records of his tenure in this university were never found- and later earning a law degree from the [[National University of San Marcos]] in 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elcomercio.pe/politica/elecciones/alan-garcia-hizo-llegar-tesis-bachiller-derecho-392305|title=Alan García nos hizo llegar su tesis de bachiller en Derecho|date=2016-02-11|website=El Comercio|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417190223/https://elcomercio.pe/politica/elecciones/alan-garcia-hizo-llegar-tesis-bachiller-derecho-392305|archive-date=2019-04-17|url-status=live|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref> A year later, he left Peru for [[Spain]], where he studied for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in law.

Already recognized as a young leader with a bright future in the country, he was elected to [[Congress of Peru|Congress]] in 1980.<ref name=britbio/> Two years later, he was elected General Secretary of the [[Peruvian Aprista Party]]. He was elected to serve as president of the Republic in the [[1985 Peruvian general election|1985 general elections]].<ref name=britbio/>

==First presidency==
{{see also|First presidency of Alan García}}
García won the presidential election on 14 April 1985 with 45% of the votes. Since he did not receive the 50% of the votes required for a first-round victory, a run-off was scheduled between him and [[Alfonso Barrantes Lingán|Alfonso Barrantes]] (the former mayor of Lima) of the [[United Left (Peru)|United Left]] party. Barrantes, however, withdrew and decided not to enter the run-off, saying he did not want to prolong the country's political uncertainty. García was thus declared President on 1 June and officially took power on 28 July 1985. For the first time in its sixty-year history, the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] party came to power in Peru. Aged 36, García was dubbed "[[Latin America]]'s [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]", becoming the region's youngest president at the time,<ref name=britbio/> and the second youngest president in Peruvian history (the youngest was [[Juan Crisostomo Torrico]] in 1842, aged 34).

His economic policy was based on APRA's initial anti-imperialist values with García distancing Peru from international markets, resulting in lower investment in the country.<ref name=":1" /> Despite his initial popularity among voters, García's term in office was marked by bouts of [[hyperinflation]], which reached 7,649% in 1990<ref name=britbio/> and had a cumulative total of 2,200,200% over the five years, which destabilized the Peruvian economy. Foreign debt under García's administration increased to $19 billion by 1989.<ref name=":1" /> Owing to this [[chronic inflation]], the Peruvian currency, the [[Peruvian sol (1863–1985)|sol]], was replaced by the [[Peruvian inti|inti]] in February 1985 (before his presidency began), which itself was replaced by the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|nuevo sol]] ("new sun") in July 1991, at which time the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion (1,000,000,000) old soles.

According to studies by the [[INEI|National Institute of Statistics and Informatics]] and the [[United Nations Development Programme]],<ref>[http://www.yachay.com.pe/especiales/internet/index1.htm Perú] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411234724/http://www.yachay.com.pe/especiales/internet/index1.htm |date=2005-04-11 }}, Atlas Internet ([[Spanish language|Spanish]])</ref> around the start of his presidency, 41.6% of Peruvians lived in poverty. During his presidency, this percentage increased by 13% (to 55%) in 1991. García also made an attempt to [[nationalization|nationalise]] the banking and insurance industries. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and the financial community recoiled after García's administration unilaterally declared a limit on debt repayment equal to 10% of the [[Gross National Product]], thereby isolating Peru from international financial markets.

His presidency was marked by world-record hyperinflation with the annual rate exceeding 13,000 percent per year. The administration devastated the local economy as well as all governmental institutions. Hunger, corruption, injustice, abuse of power, partisan elitism, and social unrest raised to dramatic levels spreading throughout the whole nation due to García's misdeeds and incompetence, spurring terrorism. The economic turbulence exacerbated social tensions and contributed in great part to the rise of the violent [[Maoist]] rebel movement known as the [[Shining Path]], which launched the [[internal conflict in Peru]] and began attacking electrical towers, causing a number of blackouts in Lima. The period also saw the emergence of the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] (MRTA).<ref>[[BBC News]].  "Peru Guerrilla Leader Convicted." 22 March 2006.

The anecdotical event was televised. That same day the board of the Chamber of Deputies requested the creation of a special committee to investigate García's Presidency, accusing him of massive corruption and illicit enrichment. The committee attacked García with numerous proven accusations involving embezzlement, misappropriation and bribery, based -among other trustworthy sources- on a U.S. congressional investigation that linked García with the BCCI scandal and had found millions of dollars in this as well as other banks. In 1991, New York District Attorney [[Robert Morgenthau]] charged García officially. Later in 1992, then U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]] presided over the BCCI Scandal Report (https://archive.org/details/TheBCCIAffair), which concluded García was not only guilty of corruption, but directly involved in an international racketeering network with activities that included drug and arm trafficking. Finally, the [[Supreme Court of Peru|Peruvian Supreme Court]] declared null all the probes and constitutional accusations gathered against García, allowing him to return to Peru after a 9-year long self-imposed exile.

==Exile==
On [[1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis|5 April 1992]], [[Alberto Fujimori]] conducted a [[self-coup]], through which he dissolved the [[Peruvian Congress]] unconstitutionally and intervened in the Judiciary and other public institutions . Due to these actions, various politicians were persecuted and prevented from leaving their homes. García had been serving as [[Senator for life]] since 1990, although he was unable to perform his duty due to the accusations of the Chamber of Deputies. He was able to return to the Senate in March 1992, after the [[Supreme Court of Peru|Supreme Court]] dropped all constitutional charges against him. According to [[Jorge Del Castillo]] in 2008, Alberto Fujimori ordered [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] to capture and assassinate García on the day of the coup.<ref>https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elmundo/4-97704-2008-01-19.html</ref><ref>https://oklahoman.com/article/3194456/afirman-que-gobierno-de-fujimori-quiso-asesinar-a-alan-garc237a</ref> According to his own testimony, García escaped his home while military tanks took over the bloc where he lived. After weeks of hiding in a construction site, he was able to enter the residence of the Colombian Ambassador at the end of May, where he requested political asylum.<ref>https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/325537.afirman-que-fujimori-quiso-asesinar-a-alan-garcia.html</ref> The request was granted on 1 June, by the government of President [[César Gaviria]]. The former president left Peru through a pass that allowed him to board a Colombian Air Force jet that transferred him to Bogotá, along with then congressman [[Jorge Del Castillo]].
García arrived at Catam military airport and in statements to the press promised to fight against the dictatorship of Alberto Fujimori.<ref>[https://elpais.com/diario/1992/06/04/internacional/707608813_850215.html Alan García promete luchar contra la dictadura peruana desde su exilio en Colombia]</ref> The regime opened judicial processes to investigate illicit enrichment and for various accusations of corruption; after that, the extradition of García was requested from the Colombian government, which was denied.<ref>[http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-30774 ALAN GARCÍA NO SERÁ EXTRADITADO]</ref>

In 1994, the Human Rights Commission of the [[Organization of American States]] denounced the Fujimori Government for violation of the rights to liberty, security and due defense of Alan García and asked the Peruvian government to nullify the processes initiated.<ref>[https://elpais.com/diario/1994/05/29/internacional/770162402_850215.html La OEA denuncia al Gobierno peruano por su persecución de Alan García]</ref>

In April 1995, Congress lifted Alan García's parliamentary immunity in response to accusations of him having received bribes from the Italian consortium Tralima for the construction of the [[Lima Metro]]. Based on this, the Civil Sector of the [[Supreme Court of Peru|Supreme Court]] once again made a request to the Government of Colombia for García's extradition, which was denied because García went to live in [[Paris]] for the rest of his exile.

During the years between 1993 and 2001, Alan García did not actively participate in Peruvian politics, except in the publication of some works on his first presidency, and a literary work entitled "The World of Maquiavelo". He continued denouncing the human rights violations committed by the Fujimori administration. On rare occasions, Alan García appeared on Peruvian television and radio from Bogotá, Colombia.

In 2001, the Supreme Court declared the allegations that were imputed to him at the end of his first term had been annulled.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1125214.stm |title=Peru court lifts Garcia corruption charge |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 January 2001 |website=[[bbc.co.uk]]|access-date=30 August 2020}}</ref>

== Return to politics ==

=== Peruvian National Election 2001 ===
Alan García returned to Lima on January 27th 2001 at 5:35pm. His return caused so much anticipation that a huge crowd of supporters was waiting for him at the airport chanting his name and showing support with hundreds of signs with the words "ALAN VUELVE". That same day at 8:30pm a rally was called in the Plaza San Martin de Lima where Garcia gave a speech in front of a large crowd.<ref>https://larepublica.pe/politica/330429-ante-multitud-en-la-plaza-san-martin-planteo-acabar-con-modelo-neoliberal-impuesto-por-el-fujimo/</ref> Some say{{Who?|date=August 2020}} there were around 20,000 people that night. Garcia ran for president in the new elections called by the interim president [[Valentín Paniagua]], and in a 60-day election campaign he finished in second place in the first round behind [[Alejandro Toledo]], qualifying him for the second round. Toledo's popularity remained stable, while Garcia's popularity was based on his innovative proposals on the issue of the agrarian bank,{{Explain|date=August 2020|reason=Need to at least explain what "the issue of the agrarian bank" was.}} not continuing with a [[neoliberal]] model, etc. However, it was not enough to acquire more endorsements and support from Peruvian voters and Alejandro Toledo won the general elections in the second round. After the [[Peruvian National Elections of 2001|2001 election]], Garcia, as leader of the APRA party, became [[Leader of the Opposition (Peru)|Leader of the Opposition]].<ref name = britbio />

García officially started his campaign for the [[2006 Peruvian national election|April 2006 presidential election]] in Lima on 20 April 2005. [[Ollanta Humala]] won the first round with 32.50% of the valid votes, followed by García, who got 24.32% (against [[Lourdes Flores]]' 23.81%). As no candidate won a majority, a run-off election was held on 4 June 2006 between Humala and García. Preliminary official results gave García an advantage over his run-off opponent, who conceded defeat.<ref name=britbio/>

On 28 April 2006, prior to the run-off, García had become involved in a dispute with [[Venezuela]]n President [[Hugo Chávez]]. For the second time in Peruvian presidential election, Chávez declared his support for Ollanta Humala, García's opponent, and referred to García as a "robber", a "bandit", and "the [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] of Peru". In response, García stated that Chávez was "not acting as a statesman" and challenged Chávez to a debate to be hosted by [[CNN]]. García called on the [[Organization of American States]] to intervene in the matter.<ref>{{lang|es|[http://www.eluniversal.com/2006/04/28/pol_ava_28A700911.shtml García reta a Chávez a polemizar por CNN]}}, ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', 28 April 2006 ([[Spanish language|Spanish]])</ref><ref>[http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/peru/archives/026151.php Alan García in Dispute with Hugo Chávez] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504183346/http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/peru/archives/026151.php |date=2006-05-04 }}, [[University of British Columbia]]—Peru Elections 2006, 28 April 2006</ref>

On 31 May 2006, a few days before the run-off election, García's economic adviser Enrique Cornejo told the media that if García won in the second round, his government would renew a US$422&nbsp;million aid package with the [[International Monetary Fund]].<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000086&sid=aamnzC.ydw6g "Peru's García Pledges to Renew IMF Loan Agreement (Update2)"], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], 31 May 2006</ref> [[Anoop Singh]], the IMF's Western Hemisphere Director, responded positively by saying he was "impressed by the vision of the president-elected for Peru, especially his commitment to applying prudent economic policy."<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/investing/financeArticle.aspx?type=bondsNews&storyID=2006-06-14T173726Z_01_N14243851_RTRIDST_0_ECONOMY-PERU-IMF-URGENT.XML "IMF says "impressed" with Peru's García's vision"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712194130/http://today.reuters.com/investing/FinanceArticle.aspx?type=bondsNews&storyID=2006-06-14T173726Z_01_N14243851_RTRIDST_0_ECONOMY-PERU-IMF-URGENT.XML |date=2006-07-12 }}, 14 June 2006 (''[[Reuters]]'').</ref>

[[Image:Garciaalan09112006-1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Alan García in Brasilia right after winning his second presidency.]]
On 28 July 2006, García was sworn in as president, after winning approximately 53% of the nationwide vote in the elections held on 4 June.<ref name=britbio/> He would spend the majority of his second term attempting to improve his reputation compared to his first term.<ref name=":1" />

He won in the capital city, Lima, and the northern coast, a geographical base of the APRA party, but lost in the southern region (mostly impoverished but including major cities such as [[Cuzco]] and [[Arequipa]]) and the [[rainforest]] areas, considered Humala's strongholds. A third of the voters said that voting for him was "voting for the lesser of two evils": although many Peruvians had a very negative impression of García after his first term, they were frightened by rumours that Humala would create a government based on [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuba]] and would turn [[Hugo Chávez]], President of Venezuela, into the virtual ruler of Peru, due to Chavez's patronage of Humala's party. These fears were accompanied by declarations of militarization, the re-introduction of the death penalty and criminalization and disrespect for LGBT communities. Humala denied these rumours, but his conflicting statements about his government's vision and Chávez's strong campaigning for him created enough suspicions among voters to cost him the [[Two-round system|ballotage]]. With 36 seats, APRA was the second largest bloc in the 120-seat unicameral [[Congress of Peru|Congress]] which was sworn in a couple of days before the President. With 45 seats, Humala's [[Union for Peru]] Party was the largest bloc, although it divided itself up into three factions.<ref>[http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/peru/archives/027538.php Exit Poll Results: Alan García in First Place] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618131022/http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/peru/archives/027538.php |date=2006-06-18 }} [[University of British Columbia]] profile of the 2006 Peruvian election. 4 June 2006.</ref>

On 28 June, one month before García was sworn in, his party gave 25 of the 79 votes (almost one third of the votes) that ratified the [[Peru–United States Trade Promotion Agreement]] in the [[Peruvian Congress]], one month prior to the new legislature that included the Union for Peru congressmen, who opposed the agreement with the USA.

In his first speech as president, García said he would appoint a Finance Minister who was neither "an orthodox market liberal" nor a person "excessively in favour of state intervention in the economy". The position of Prime Minister was given to [[Jorge Del Castillo|Jorge del Castillo]]. According to the [[BBC]], in private interviews García had stated his interest in a possible future trade agreement with Brazil and considered himself "an admirer" of Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]].<ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_5053000/5053786.stm "García desestima roces con Chávez"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106124207/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_5053000/5053786.stm |date=2012-11-06 }}, 6 June 2006 ''BBC Mundo''.</ref>

In press conferences with the foreign press, García acknowledged that the support Humala received in the election "could not be ignored". García, in a recognition of future domestic politics with a UPP controlled Congress, was quoted as saying "Mr. Humala is an important political figure, and a President should consult with different political factions".<ref name=BBC/> However, Humala said he wouldn't salute the winner personally, adding that "he and his party will constitute the principal opposition bloc, not to fight Mr. García, but to defend the interests of the State and watch the government".<ref>[http://www.elcomercioperu.com.pe/EdicionImpresa/Html/2006-06-08/ImpPortada0519174.html "Humala says he won't give García truce"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074116/http://www.elcomercioperu.com.pe/EdicionImpresa/Html/2006-06-08/ImpPortada0519174.html |date=2006-06-23 }}, [[El Comercio (Peru)|El Comercio]], 8 June 2006.</ref>

President Chávez of Venezuela responded to García's comments on his show ''[[Aló Presidente]]'' by stating that it was García who owed him an apology, saying: "the only way relations between the two countries can be restored is if Peru's elected President [García] gives an explanation and offers an apology to the Venezuelan people.

On 20 July 2006, García named [[Luis Carranza]] as Finance Minister, a former executive at [[Spain]]-based [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria]] and Central Bank director and deputy finance chief from August 2004 to August 2005 in [[Alejandro Toledo]]'s government. The appointment was welcomed by some detractors of García's fiscal policies during his first administration.

García faced his first major political defeat of his second term in office on 11 January 2007 when his proposal to introduce the death penalty as a punishment for captured [[Shining Path]] rebels was rejected by [[Congress of Peru|Congress]] in a vote of 49 to 26. García had promised to introduce the death penalty for Shining Path rebels during the [[2006 Peruvian national election|2006 Presidential election]].

With the passage of time, studies of human rights violations in Peru have discovered a close relationship between García and the forces within Peru who promote impunity for human rights violators, through his involvement in appointing judges who would be sympathetic to perpetrators of human rights violations.  Additionally, García was supportive of efforts to punish judges who handed down indictments of perpetrators.  García himself was in the presidency during many gross violations of human rights and was quite hostile to human rights organizations and to judicial actors who seek justice for victims of human rights violations.  During his presidency García sought to tilt the legal playing field in favour of the military and against victims.  He also tried to make life difficult for [[NGO]]s seeking to help victims.  For example, he offered extensive resources to defendants and military officers while creating new laws that would make it difficult for human rights NGOs to do their jobs, receive necessary resources, and pursue the advancement of judicial action that attempted to bring human rights violators to justice.<ref>Ezequiel A.

=== Odebrecht scandal and suicide ===

The Peruvian press reported that in May 2012, after leaving office, García was paid US$100,000 to give a speech to Brazilian business leaders in São Paulo, money which was later characterized in the media as, and suspected by Peruvian prosecutors to be, a [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]] from the [[Brazil]]ian construction company [[Odebrecht]]. Because García reported and paid taxes on each payment he received, and multiple organizations were willing to pay him to have him as speaker, his defense and lawyers were optimistic that they could show that the payments did not constitute bribery.<ref>

In 2016 and 2017, five of García's former ministers were accused of [[corruption]] by the Peruvian justice system: [[Yehude Simon]] (Prime Minister), [[Rosario Fernández]] (Minister of Justice), [[Mercedes Cabanillas]] (Minister of the Interior), [[Ántero Flores Aráoz]] (Minister of Defence), and [[Luis Nava Guibert]] (Minister of Production).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larepublica.pe/politica/892438-caso-odebrecht-cinco-ministros-de-alan-garcia-son-citados-por-la-fiscalia|title=Caso Odebrecht: Cinco ministros de Alan García son citados por la Fiscalía - LaRepublica.pe|first=Redacción|last=LR|date=5 July 2017|accessdate=10 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812060737/http://larepublica.pe/politica/892438-caso-odebrecht-cinco-ministros-de-alan-garcia-son-citados-por-la-fiscalia|archive-date=12 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In November 2018, García was banned from leaving Peru by the courts due to the Odebrecht scandal investigation. He entered the residence of the Uruguayan ambassador on 17 November, requesting [[Asylum seeker|asylum]]. However, on 3 December his request was denied, and he subsequently left the ambassador's residence.<ref>{{cite news |title=Peru corruption: Ex-President Alan García denied asylum |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46430050 |publisher=3 December 2018 |accessdate=9 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209172513/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46430050 |archive-date=9 December 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all |work=BBC News |date=2018-12-03 }}</ref>
