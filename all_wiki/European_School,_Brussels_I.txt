The '''European School, Brussels I''' ('''ESB1''') is a [[European School]] located in [[Uccle]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Originally the second of the European Schools to be founded, the European School, Brussels I, is today one of four in Brussels, and thirteen such schools across the [[European Union]] (EU). It is an [[all-through school]], which exists primarily to provide an education to children of [[Brussels and the European Union|EU staff and officials based in Brussels]] leading to the [[European Baccalaureate]] as their [[Secondary school qualifications|secondary leaving qualification]]. Its alumni include the President of the European Commission, [[Ursula von der Leyen]], and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, [[Boris Johnson]].{{refn|group=nb|Von der Leyen and Johnson's status as alumni of the school was the first topic of conversation at their first face-to-face meeting at the [[10 Downing Street|UK prime minister's residence]], following their appointments to their respective posts.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Boffey |first1=Daniel |title=Johnson's first meeting with Von der Leyen lays trade deal faultlines bare |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/08/johnsons-first-meeting-with-von-der-leyen-lays-trade-deal-faultlines-bare |accessdate=18 January 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=8 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media |date= 8 January 2020| title=Boris Johnson reveals he went to the same school as Ursula von der Leyen |medium=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2p-Xun0LpA |access-date=18 January 2020 |location=London |publisher=The Telegraph}}</ref>}}

==Language sections==

In keeping with the multilingual and multicultural ethos and curriculum of the European Schools, the four Brussels-based European Schools are divided into language sections, with all schools required to host [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] sections.<ref name="Policy on Enrolment">{{cite web |title=Policy on Enrolment in the Brussels European Schools for the 2019-2020 school year {{!}} Central Enrolment Authority |url=https://www.eursc.eu/Documents/2018-12-D-14-en-2.pdf |website=eursc.eu |publisher=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=25 July 2019}}</ref> In addition to these, ESB1 comprises [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] sections.<ref name="Policy on Enrolment" /> The [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Slovakian language|Slovakian]] sections of the school currently operate to the end of the primary cycle.<ref name="Policy on Enrolment" />{{refn|group=nb| Since the ESB1's establishment in 1958, the language sections operating within it have varied owing to local student demand, and the requirements imposed on the European Schools by new European Communities - and now European Union - Member States which then aceded to the international treaties governing them. Additionally, the opening of other European Schools in Brussels offered the possibility of dedicating the resources needed to run particular language sections to particular European Schools within the city.}}

Applications for enrolment in the four Brussels-based European Schools are administered centrally, with all applications for those whose [[mother-tongue]] is Danish, Hungarian, Polish, [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] or [[Maltese language|Maltese]] referred automatically to the ESB1, along with applications for enrolment in the nursery and primary cycles of the Latvian section.<ref name="Policy on Enrolment" /> 
 
Students enroled in the schools are generally instructed in the language of their respective section. Students must choose from either English, French or German for their second language, which becomes the language of instruction for [[History]] and [[Geography]] curriculum from the third-year secondary, as well as the optional [[Economics]] course available from fourth year. Students are also expected to take a third language upon entering the secondary cycle. Students whose mother-tongue is not covered by a language section, are enroled in the English, French or German sections, and can opt for their mother-tongue in place of English, French or German studies, respectively.

==History==
{{Further|European_Schools#History}}
The first [[European School, Luxembourg I|European School]] was founded in [[Luxembourg]] in 1953 as a private initiative of officials working for the institutions of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), based within the jurisdiction, to provide an education to their children in their [[mother-tongue]]s, whilst instructing them in a multilingual, multicultural environment.<ref name="60thAnniversary">{{cite book |author1=European Schools |title=European Schools, 1953-2013 |date=2013 |publisher=Publications Office of the European Union |location=Luxembourg |isbn=978-92-9188-143-7 |doi=10.2842/11549 |url=https://www.eursc.eu/Documents/QI0313276ENCp.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|pages=3, 6–7}} On 12 April 1957, the [[Inner Six|six founding states]] of the ECSC transformed the initiative into an [[intergovernmental organisation]], signing the Statute of the European School, with the Board of Governors of the School being composed of the [[Minister of education|ministers of education]] of the six signatory states. The month prior, on 25 March 1957, the same states had signed the two Treaties of Rome, which established the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) on 1 January 1958. In a meeting of the foreign ministers of the six founding states of the three communities, held on 6 and 7 January 1958, Brussels and Luxembourg were selected as [[Institutional seats of the European Union|provisional seats of the Commissions and Council meetings of the EEC and Euratom.]]<ref name="institutions">{{cite web |last1=Valls |first1=Raquel |title=The seats of the institutions of the European Union |url=https://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_seats_of_the_institutions_of_the_european_union-en-cd672879-aeb1-4cad-a0c1-9e4ff75ff660.html |website=cvce.eu |publisher=CVCE.EU by UNI.LU |accessdate=19 March 2019 |date=8 July 2016}}</ref> Consequently, at the request of the Belgian authorities, the Board of Governors of the European School agreed to the founding of a European School in Brussels.

Upon its opening at site on rue du Trône in September 1958, the school had just 26 pupils and six teachers.<ref name="60thAnniversary" />{{rp|pages=8–9}} In September 1959, the school relocated to its current main campus, made available by [[Federal Government of Belgium|the Belgian State]], in the leafy Brussels suburb of [[Uccle]].<ref name="60thAnniversary" />{{rp|pages=8–9}}[[File:European School Brussels I-1971-001.jpg|thumb|Flags of the then 6 European Communities states fly in front of the school's administrative building in 1971.]]

Demand for school places increased following the [[Merger Treaty|merging]] of the executives and Councils of the three [[European Communities]] (EC) in 1967, with most of their departments relocating permanently to Brussels, along with their staff and families.<ref name="institutions" /> The [[Enlargement of the European Union#First enlargement|first wave of enlargement of the EC]] in 1973, also saw the same States accede to the Statue of the European School, in order to provide an education to children of staff seconded or hired from their respective nations. Increasing demand for school places led to the establishment of a [[European School, Brussels II|second School]] in Brussels in 1974. The [[Maastricht Treaty|incorporation]] of the EC into the [[European Union]] in 1993, and successive waves of [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] of its membership, led to increased staff presence in the city. With new EC - and then EU - entrants each successively acceding to the international framework governing the Schools (repealed and replaced in 2002 by the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools, originally signed in 1994), a [[European School, Brussels III|third]] and [[European School, Brussels IV|fourth]] school were founded in Brussels in 1999 and 2007, respectively.

In 2015 the Boards of Governors of the [[European Schools]] agreed to the use of the European School, Brussels I's Berkandael site as a temporary overflow campus for the school up until the establishment of a fifth European School in Brussels on the site of the former [[NATO]] headquarters originally due in September 2019.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Board of Governors of the European Schools|authorlink1=European_Schools#Board_of_Governors|title=Decisions of the meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Schools: Meeting of 1-3 December 2015 – Brussels |url=https://www.eursc.eu/Documents/2018-10-D-17-en-3.pdf|website=eursc.eu|publisher=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools|accessdate=19 March 2019|pages=14–15|quote= The European School, Brussels I has two sites, at Uccle and at Berkendael. In accordance with the Board of Governors’ decision of 6 May 2010 (2010-D-232-en-2), in the future, a fifth European School will be opened in Brussels, designed to accommodate 2500 pupils.[…] In the meantime, stop-gap solutions to the structural shortage of places available lie in: […] continuing temporary availability of the Berkendael Site (subject to confirmation to be obtained from the Council of Ministers of Belgium’s Federal Government) until the fifth school opens. […] The Administrative Board of the European School, Brussels I retains responsibility for management of the two sites.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hope |first1=Alan |title=Fifth European School to take over former site of NATO |url=http://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/education/12099/fifth-european-school-to-take-over-former-site-of-nato |accessdate=19 March 2019 |work=The Brussels Times |date=29 July 2018}}</ref> In January 2020, the Belgian government approved the project, with the school expected to open in time for the 2021 academic year.<ref>{{cite news |title=New European School will open in Brussels in 2021 |url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels/93008/new-european-school-will-open-in-brussels-in-2021/ |accessdate=1 June 2020 |work=The Brussels Times |date=31 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Green light for new European School in Evere |url=https://www.thebulletin.be/green-light-new-european-school-evere |accessdate=1 June 2020 |work=The Bulletin |date=2 February 2020}}</ref>
