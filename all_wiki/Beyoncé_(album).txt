'''''Beyoncé''''' (often stylized in [[all caps]]) is the [[eponymous]] fifth solo studio album by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. The record was released on December 13, 2013, by [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]]. Developed as a "visual album", its songs are accompanied by non-linear short films that illustrate the musical concepts conceived during production. Its dark, intimate subject material includes [[feminist]] themes of [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[Monogamy|monogamous love]], and relationship issues, inspired by Beyoncé's desire to assert her full creative freedom.

The album's initial recording began in [[New York City]], where Beyoncé invited producers and songwriters to live with her for a month. During extensive touring the following year, the album changed as she conceived of creating a visual accompaniment to its songs and resumed recording sessions with [[Electronic music|electronic]] producer and [[Rock music|rock]] musician [[Boots (musician)|Boots]]. Their collaboration led to more sonically [[Experimental music|experimental]] material, which combined [[contemporary R&B]] with electronic and [[soul music]]. Throughout this period, the album's songs and videos were composed in strict secrecy as Beyoncé devised an unexpected release.

''Beyoncé'' was released digitally on the [[iTunes Store]] without prior announcement or promotion, and debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], earning Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album on the chart. The album sold over 617,000 copies in the United States and 828,773 copies worldwide in its first three days of sales, becoming the fastest-selling album in the history of the iTunes Store up to that point.<ref>{{cite news|first=Clarisse|last=Loughrey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/adeles-album-is-no1-in-almost-every-country-in-the-world-a6749626.html|title=Adele's new album 25 is No.1 on iTunes in almost every country in the world|date=November 26, 2015|work=Independent|access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref> According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Beyoncé'' was globally the tenth-best-selling album of 2013.<ref name="IFPI 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|access-date=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> The album was [[reissue]]d in November 2014 as part of a [[Beyoncé: Platinum Edition|platinum edition]], along with an [[More (Beyoncé EP)|extended play]] of new songs, and has sold over <!--please, don't inflate the number-->5 million copies worldwide. Part of the album was promoted on [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour]] during the 2014 legs.

''Beyoncé'' received universal acclaim from critics upon release who praised its production, exploration of sexuality, vocal performance, as well as the album's surprise release strategy which was subsequently replicated by many artists.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6406019/pulling-a-beyonce-fleek-slang-terms|title=From 'Pulling a Beyonce' to 'On Fleek,' Slang Terms That Invaded 2014 {{!}} ''Billboard''|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> ''Beyoncé'' is generally considered one of the greatest and most influential albums of the 21st century, and was ranked 81st in [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|''Rolling Stone''<nowiki/>'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] list.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Rolling|last2=Stone|first2=Rolling|date=2020-09-22|title=The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/beyonce-beyonce-1063152/|access-date=2020-09-27|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

In mid-2013, a relatively unknown artist [[Boots (producer)|Boots]], signed a publishing deal with Jay-Z's [[Roc Nation]]. In an interview for ''Pitchfork'' after the album's release, Boots was coy when answering questions about how Beyoncé discovered his demo or of his work previous to the project, only confirming his signing. In June 2013, they met in person for the first time and Boots presented Beyoncé with material he felt would resonate with her. However, Beyoncé was more interested in his experimental material, and he reluctantly played her his song "[[Haunted (Beyoncé song)|Haunted]]" on his cellphone. She refused to ignore its potential. At a later meeting, he played her a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] rap called "Ghost", which he wrote after an exasperating meeting with a potential record label. Boots began by composing a [[melody]] that reminded him of a hypnotic state, then layering guitar [[arpeggios]] to resemble the work of English electronic musician [[Aphex Twin]]. Subsequently, "Ghost" became the first half of "Haunted"; he later described Beyoncé as the "only visionary in the room" for her ability to find potential in scraps of songs. Following these sessions, Boots would go on to work on eighty percent of ''Beyoncé''.<ref name=boots>{{cite news|last=Greene|first=Jason|title=Beyoncé's Muse|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9309-beyonces-muse/|access-date=March 17, 2014|work=Pitchfork|date=January 21, 2014}}</ref>

Similarly, the bassline of "[[Partition (song)|Partition]]", which Beyoncé found reminiscent of hip hop music during her early romance with Jay-Z, influenced her to accompany the track with sexual lyrics.<ref name="liberation" /> She took to a microphone without pen and paper and rapped the first verse, finding herself initially embarrassed by the explicitness of the lyrics. When composing "Partition", a rap known as "Yoncé" was used as the opening of the track, the beat of which was built by Justin Timberlake banging on buckets in the studio.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who Is Yoncé?

She highlighted the immersive experience of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' (1982) as the principal influence for creating a body of work that "people would hear things differently and [...] actually be able to see the whole vision of the album".<ref name="thevisualalbum">{{cite AV media |people=[[Zachary Heinzerling|Heinzerling, Zachary]] (Director) |title="Self Titled" Part 1.

"Flawless", "Rocket" and "Mine" were noted as having been changed by their visual counterparts, Tourso commenting that "she would rewrite some lines, or she would add certain audio, or she would add bridges" and believed that "it would complete the picture of where the audio needed to go".<ref name="atlantic" />

Several videos were intended to demonstrate the album's central theme of "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition ''[[Star Search]]'' as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had taught her how to embrace imperfection in the future.<ref name="imperfection" /> The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, all of the time that I lost".<ref name="imperfection" /> It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for "Drunk in Love", "Yoncé", "No Angel", "XO" and "Blue" shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them.<ref name="runngun" /> Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, "I know finding my sensuality, getting back into my body, being proud of growing up, it was important to me that I expressed that... I know that there are so many women who feel the same way".<ref name="liberation" />

==Music and lyrics==
''Beyoncé'' is a fourteen track set with seventeen short films: a video for each audio track, two extra videos to accompany the two-part tracks "Haunted" and "Partition", as well as a bonus video for "Grown Woman", which lacks an equivalent audio counterpart.<ref name="credits" /> Departing from the traditional R&B leanings of its predecessor, ''4'' (2011),<ref name=fact>{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Chris|title=Beyoncé|url=http://www.factmag.com/2013/12/17/beyonce/|access-date=October 25, 2016|work=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]|date=December 17, 2013}}</ref> ''Beyoncé''{{'}}s songs are predominantly [[alternative R&B]].<ref name="pitchfork" />{{refn|group=nb|Chris DeVille, writing in [[Stereogum]] five months after ''Beyoncé''{{'}}s release argues that alternative R&B reached its saturation point in early 2014.

Other songs allude to darker themes of fear and personal insecurities.

==Artwork==
Tourso and his small team of designers was tasked with designing ''Beyoncé''{{'}}s album cover, which he found difficult considering it was a visual album and thus "inundated with imagery". Over three months he considered over a hundred options, only to proceed with his very first idea. He was inspired by the cover of [[Metallica]]'s [[Metallica (album)|eponymous fifth studio album]] (1991) to create a bold statement, specifically to deviate from a "beauty shot" of Beyoncé which he felt would be expected. They used a font similar to placards used in boxing matches to represent abrasive masculinity, which was contrasted by the greyish-pink font which they described as "a subversion of femininity".<ref name=atlantic>{{cite news|last1=Kornhaber|first1=Spencer|title=Beyoncé's 'Flawless': The Full Story|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/the-full-story-of-beyonces-flawless/373480/|access-date=July 5, 2014|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=June 26, 2014}}</ref>

''Beyoncé'' received widespread acclaim from [[music critics]]. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted mean]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received a high score of 85, based on 34 reviews.<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/beyonce/beyonce|title=Reviews for Beyoncé by Beyoncé|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=December 13, 2013}}</ref> Critics generally commended the album as thematically and musically bold, as well as emphasizing its visual aspect and [[Surprise album|surprise release]]; many said it was her ''[[wikt:magnum opus|magnum opus]]''.<ref name="spin" /><ref name="chicago" /><ref name="hampp" /><ref name="allmusic" /> Summarising the album for ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]],'' Jillian Mapes calls ''Beyoncé'' "MJ-level talent met pop-perfectionism in a moment that defined album-cycle disruption [and] a victory lap Bey took as pop feminism's reigning goddess".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21867-lemonade/|title=Beyoncé: Lemonade|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>

The album's exploration of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} chief critic [[Jon Pareles]] described the tracks as "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" noting that "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist".<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/14/arts/music/beyonces-new-album-is-steamy-and-sleek.html |title=A December Surprise, Without Whispers (or Leaks)|author-link=Jon Pareles|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 13, 2013|access-date=December 13, 2013}}</ref> Caitlin White, writing for ''[[The 405 (website)|The 405]]'', characterized ''Beyoncé'' as a feminist text. She noted that the tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly.<ref name="the405">{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Caitlin|title=Beyoncé – Beyoncé|url=http://www.thefourohfive.com/music/review/beyonce-beyonce|access-date=May 30, 2016|publisher=The 405|date=January 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407034027/http://www.thefourohfive.com/music/review/beyonce-beyonce|archive-date=April 7, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] admired the album's "sex sequence" of songs, where for "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [she] knows eroticism does, for each of us in our individual responses as well as for her".<ref name="xgau">{{cite news|last1=Christgau|first1=Robert|author-link1=Robert Christgau|title=Beyoncé/D'Angelo|url=https://medium.com/cuepoint/robert-christgau-expert-witness-156a033a8dc1|publisher=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|access-date=October 25, 2016|date=January 2, 2015}}</ref> [[PopMatters]]' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men want to hear what she has to say and the women feel like they can say it to men as well".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Amidon|first1=David|title=Beyoncé – Beyoncé|url=https://www.popmatters.com/review/177859-beyonce-beyonc/|work=[[PopMatters]]|access-date=July 28, 2014|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>

Other reviews recognized that the album eschewed [[contemporary R&B]] in favor of more [[Experimental music|experimental]] compositions. ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' writer Carrie Battan of the same publication wrote that Beyoncé was "exploring sounds and ideas at the grittier margins of popular music" and rejecting "traditional pop structures in favor of atmosphere".<ref name="pitchfork" /> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''{{'}}s Anupa Mistry felt it was "more textured than its predecessors in both sound and content", and applauded the singer's transition to a maturer sound of "big-hook message pop, multi-directional, mood-shifting suites and delicately resonant R&B ballads".<ref name="spin" /> Noting the lack of "guaranteed hits", ''[[NME]]'' believed that the "low-key, moody production throws the spotlight on the words and the images brought to play" and described it as her most experimental work to date.<ref name="NME" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s pop critic [[Rob Sheffield]] found ''Beyoncé''{{'}}s boldness among its best attributes, believing the album is at its "strongest when it goes for full-grown electro soul with an artsy boho edge".<ref name="rollingstone" /> Mikael Wood of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' highlighted a desire to push creative boundaries among the tracks and admired "how the music similarly blends the intimate and the extravagant",<ref name="latimes" /> while ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Nick Catucci concluded that the album was characterized by "clashing impulses—between strength and escape, megapop and fresh sounds, big messages and resonant lyrics".<ref name="Entertainment Weekly" />

Praise was also reserved for Beyoncé's vocal performance. ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Neil McCormick declared Beyoncé as "one of the most technically gifted vocalists in pop" favoring her "gospel power, hip-hop flow and [huge] range". He was particularly complimentary of the vocal restraint displayed across the tracks that was absent from previous releases.<ref name="telegraph" /> [[Kitty Empire]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' noted the diverseness of her vocals on the album's up-tempo songs and found the singer ranging between "squeaky sexed-up falsettos, hood rat rapping, wordless ecstasies and effortless swoops".<ref name="observer" /> ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' regarded her voice most effective on the album's ballads, where they commented on how diversely her vocals conveyed feelings of love and described her "power and control [as] breathtaking".<ref name="clash">{{cite news|last1=Diver|first1=Mike|title=Beyoncé – Beyoncé|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/beyonce-beyonce|access-date=May 31, 2016|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>
