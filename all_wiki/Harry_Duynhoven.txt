Duynhoven entered [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] in the [[1987 New Zealand general election|1987 election]], winning the [[New Plymouth (New Zealand electorate)|New Plymouth]] seat from incumbent [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] MP, [[Tony Friedlander]]. In the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 election]], he lost the seat to [[New Zealand National Party|National]]'s [[John Armstrong (New Zealand politician)|John Armstrong]], but won it back in the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993 election]]. In the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 election]] he lost to [[New Zealand National Party]] candidate, [[Jonathan Young (politician)|Jonathan Young]] by 105 votes,<ref>[http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2008/electorate-31.html Chief Electoral Office: Official Count Results: New Plymouth.]</ref> the smallest margin in the election.<ref>[http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2008/electoratestatus.html Chief Electoral Office: Official Count Results: Electorate Status.]</ref>

In 2003, Duynhoven raised with the Speaker of Parliament his status, and whether he might have breached electoral law, thus disqualifying him from retaining his seat. The Speaker was responsible for determining whether a vacancy existed. This matter arose after Duynhoven applied to resume his [[citizenship]] of the [[Netherlands]]. His father was from the [[Netherlands]], and Duynhoven had possessed citizenship from birth, but had temporarily lost it due to a change of [[Netherlands]] law. According to electoral law, applying for foreign citizenship would disqualify Duynhoven from retaining his seat. The Speaker ruled on 23 July 2003 that Parliament's Privileges Committee, who were until 2002 responsible for determining whether a vacancy exists, would consider the matter, and that he would be guided by their report. The Solicitor General advised the Privileges Committee that the law was clear, and that Duynhoven's seat became vacant on 11 June 2003. The majority decision of the Privileges Committee was that Duynhoven was disqualified from holding his seat, and that it had accordingly been vacated. However the government introduced an act retroactively amending the law, to allow Duynhoven to resume his seat.{{fact|date=February 2020}}

Duynhoven served as a Minister outside [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] of [[Helen Clark]]'s [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour Government]] with the portfolio of Associate Minister of Transport, and later, Minister for Transport Safety and Associate Minister of Energy until his government's defeat. He did not stand as a [[party list]] candidate in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]].

In 1990, Duynhoven was awarded the [[New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Alister |last2=Coddington |first2=Deborah |authorlink1=Alister Taylor |authorlink2=Deborah Coddington |title=Honoured by the Queen – New Zealand |year=1994 |publisher=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa |location=Auckland |isbn=0-908578-34-2 |page=129}}</ref> He was appointed a [[Queen's Service Order|Companion of the Queen's Service Order]] in the [[2012 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2012 New Year Honours]], for services as a Member of Parliament.<ref name="DMPC_NYHonours2012">{{cite web | url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/new-year-honours-list-2012 | title=New Year honours list 2012|date=31 December 2011 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref>

== Local government politics ==
In October 2010, Duynhoven was elected [[Mayor of New Plymouth]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/local-elections-2010/4215593/New-Plymouths-new-mayor |title=New Plymouth's new mayor |last=Keith | first=Leighton |date=9 October 2010 |work=[[Taranaki Daily News]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref> Three years later, on 12 October 2013, Mr Duynhoven became the first New Plymouth mayor since Edward Hill in 1956 to be ousted after one term."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/9276437/Andrew-Judd-mayor-of-New-Plymouth |title=Andrew Judd mayor of New Plymouth |last=Rilkoff | first=Matt  |date=12 October 2013 |work=[[Taranaki Daily News]] |accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> He attributed his defeat at that election to being overshadowed by maverick councillor John McLeod.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-09-27|title=Horse's political legacy|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/10551278/Horses-political-legacy|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Stuff|language=en}}</ref>

McLeod, along with fellow councillor Len Houwers, resigned in late 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-12-04|title='Ineffective' councillor quits|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/63860629/ineffective-councillor-quits|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Stuff|language=en}}</ref> On 11 January 2015, Duynhoven confirmed months of speculation that he would stand in the by-election to fill the vacancies. Duynhoven said his decision to stand in the by-election came after receiving "a huge number of phone calls and visits from people asking me to stand."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/64846633/Harry-Duynhoven-returns-in-by-election |title=Harry Duynhoven returns in by-election |date=11 January 2013 |work=[[Taranaki Daily News]] |accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> Duynhoven was one of the two successful candidates. He was re-elected in the [[2016 New Zealand local elections|2016 local elections]] and the [[2019 New Zealand local elections|2019 local elections]]. In both of those elections, he was also elected to the [[Taranaki District Health Board]].
