==History==
The institute was founded in St. Thomas Convent, [[Mylapore]]. In 1888, St. Antony's school was run by the parish priest for the education of [[Anglo-Indian]] children. In 1897, the [[Franciscan Missionaries of Mary]] sisters took charge of it and it came to be called as St. Thomas European School. In 1909 the name "Holy Angels' " was given to the boarding house for Anglo-Indian children. But larger accommodations were soon required. Mgr. Teixeira, the Portuguese Bishop of Mylapore since 1928 proposed to sell to the FFM a piece of church property measuring approximately 5 acres at Mambalam (now [[T. Nagar]]).

In February 1933 the institution purchased the land and plans were made for the construction of an Anglo-Indian School, a boarding home and a convent. Eight rooms were erected by 21 March 1934. Two months later, Bishop Carvalho laid the foundation for a new building in [[Mambalam]](now [[T.Nagar]]). On 1 June 1934 Our Lady's Kindergarten was opened comprising the outhouses. The first headmistress was M. Notre Dame de Pompei, born in India to Irish parents.

On 2 August 1934 the foundation stone for the new mission was blessed by the Bishop of Mylapore. On 2 July 1935, Holy Angels' was placed in a magnificent new building. On 27 June 1935 Mgr. Carvalho blessed each section of the new construction. Between 1937 and 1940 the original block was lengthened, a wing added and a floor constructed, and the complete building was bridged to the main building.

==Convent==
By July 1935 the [[Franciscan Missionaries of Mary|FMM]] superior at [[Mylapore]] decided that the Holy Angels' institution would need to have a separate community with its own superior. On 5 August 1935 the decision was finalised and a community of nine sisters moved into a wing of the new building. An [[International Eucharistic Congress]] was held in [[Madras]] from 28 to 30 December 1937, the convent hosted a number of sisters of different congregations.

==World War II==
In 1942, the children of the school, the sisters of the convent and the teachers were evacuated to [[Palmaner]]. A total of 252 pupils, 14 sisters, 8 lay teachers and 20 housemaids left. Meanwhile, the government authorities requisitioned the Holy Angels' property to be used as Air Raid Precaution Headquarters, the Madras High Court and the Law College for the duration of the war. In the chapel, a section of the main construction at Holy Angels' the Eucharist was celebrated very early on the morning of 22 April 1942. One very valuable item was left standing in the empty chapel: the beautiful and venerated statue of the Madonna, which would guard and protect Holy Angels' for the next four years. This statue of Madonna and the child Christ is a souvenir of [[Helene de Chappotin]] and is today housed in St. Thomas convent, provincial house of the Chennai Province.
