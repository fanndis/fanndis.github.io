'''John Dimitri Negroponte''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɛ|ɡ|r|oʊ-|ˈ|p|ɒ|n|t|i}}; born July 21, 1939) is an American diplomat. He is currently a James R. Schlesinger Distinguished Professor at the Miller Center for Public Affairs at the University of Virginia.  He is a former J.B. and Maurice C. Shapiro Professor of International Affairs at the [[George Washington University]]'s [[Elliott School of International Affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gwtoday.gwu.edu/ambassador-john-d-negroponte-briefing-future-president-about-foreign-policy |title=Ambassador John D.

Negroponte served in the [[United States Foreign Service]] from 1960 to 1997. From 1981 to 1996, he had tours of duty as [[Ambassadors from the United States|United States ambassador]] in [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]], and the [[Foreign relations of the Philippines|Philippines]]. After leaving the Foreign Service, he subsequently served in the [[George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] as [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations]] from 2001 to 2004, and was ambassador to [[Iraq]] from June 2004 to April 2005. In November 2010, some of Negroponte's letters were released on the website [[WikiLeaks]].<ref>[https://wikileaks.org/cable/2008/12/08STATE134490.html purported Negroponte cable], accessed February 6, 2014</ref>

==Early life and education==
Negroponte was born in [[London]], United Kingdom, on July 21, 1939, to Greek parents {{Interlanguage link multi|Dimitri John|el|3=Δημήτριος Νεγρεπόντης}} (1915–1996) and Catherine Coumantaros Negroponte (1916–2000). His father was a [[Greece|Greek]] shipping magnate and alpine skier who competed in the [[1936 Winter Olympics]]. Negroponte attended the [[Allen-Stevenson School]] and graduated from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in 1956 and Yale University in 1960. He was a member of Fence Club ([[Psi Upsilon]] fraternity), alongside [[William H. T. Bush]], the brother of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]], and [[Porter Goss]], who served as [[Director of Central Intelligence]] and [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] under Negroponte from 2005 to 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/008390.php |title=Big world, small world |last=Marshall |first=Joshua Micah |work=Talking Points Memo blog |date=2006-05-07 |access-date=2006-07-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819222949/http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/008390.php |archive-date=2006-08-19 }}</ref>

After less than a semester at [[Harvard Law School]], Negroponte joined the Foreign Service in 1960.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/29/politics/29negroponte.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|title=Poker-Faced Diplomat, Negroponte Is Poised for Role as Spy Chief|author=Scott Shane|date=March 29, 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=2007-10-12}}</ref> He served at eight different Foreign Service posts in Asia (including the [[U.S. Embassy, Saigon]]),<ref>{{Citation |last=Paxman |first=Jeremy |author-link=Jeremy Paxman |title=Through the Volcanoes: A Central American Journey |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Paladin |page=133}}</ref> Europe and Latin America, and he also held important positions at the [[State Department]] and the White House. As a young Foreign Service officer—one of the few men in Washington who dared to openly disagree with Henry Kissinger's secret handling of the Vietnam peace talks—Negroponte attempted to convince his superior that any peace agreement negotiated without the consent of South Vietnam's leader [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu|Nguyen Van Thieu]] would be doomed to failure. [[Seymour Hersh]] claims in his book ''The Price of Power'' that Kissinger never forgave Negroponte, and, upon becoming Secretary of State, exiled him to Quito, Ecuador. Ironically, this was to be the beginning of Negroponte's long distinguished career as an ambassador. In 1981, he became the U.S. Ambassador to [[Honduras]]. From 1985 to 1987, Negroponte held the position of Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. Subsequently, he served as [[Deputy National Security Advisor|Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs]], from 1987 to 1989; Ambassador to [[Mexico]], from 1989 to 1993; and Ambassador to the [[Philippines]] from 1993 to 1996. As Deputy National Security Advisor to President [[Ronald Reagan]], he was involved in the campaign to remove from power General [[Manuel Noriega]] in [[Panama]]. From 1997 until his appointment as ambassador to the U.N., Negroponte was an executive with [[McGraw-Hill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/outofdate/bios/n/34156.htm|title=U.S. State Department Biographies|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>

Negroponte speaks five languages ([[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]). He is the elder brother of [[Nicholas Negroponte]], founder of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s [[MIT Media Lab|Media Lab]] and of the [[One Laptop per Child]] project. His brother [[Michel Negroponte]] is an [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[filmmaker]], and his other brother, George Negroponte, is an [[artist]] and was President of the Drawing Center from 2002 to 2007. Negroponte and his wife, [[Diana Villiers Negroponte|Diana Mary Villiers]] (b. August 14, 1947), have five adopted children, Marina, Alexandra, John, George and Sophia, all of whom were adopted from [[Honduras]]. On February 16, 2020 it was reported that daughter Sophia was arrested on the charge of first-degree murder for the stabbing death of a man.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/feb/16/sophia-negroponte-john-negropontes-daughter-charge/|title=Former U.S. ambassador's daughter charged with first-degree murder|publisher=[[Washington Times]]|date=February 16, 2020|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/15/us/john-negroponte-daughter-arrested/index.html|title=The daughter of former US diplomat John Negroponte is accused of stabbing a man to death|author1=Nicole Chavez |author2=Laura Ly |author3=Kenneth Cooper|website=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/john-negroponte-daughter-charged-with-murder|title=Adopted daughter of former top diplomat John Negroponte charged with murder in Maryland stabbing|first=Samuel|last=Chamberlain|date=February 14, 2020|website=Fox News}}</ref> The Negropontes were married on December 14, 1971.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Career==

===Ambassador to Honduras (1981–1985)===
[[File:OHE19840416 04.jpg|thumb|left|John Negroponte at the Military Camp in Honduras in April 1984]]
From 1981 to 1985, Negroponte was the U.S. ambassador to [[Honduras]]. During this time, military aid to Honduras grew from $4 million to $77.4 million a year, and the US began to maintain a significant military presence there, with the goal of [[Iran–Contra affair|overthrowing]] the revolutionary [[Sandinista]] government of [[Nicaragua]], a leftist party which had driven out the Somoza dictatorship.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The previous U.S. ambassador to Honduras, [[Jack Binns]], who was appointed by President [[Jimmy Carter]], made numerous complaints about human rights abuses by the Honduran military under the government of [[Policarpo Paz García]]. After the inauguration of [[Ronald Reagan]], Binns was replaced by Negroponte, who has denied having knowledge of any wrongdoing by Honduran military forces.

In 1995, ''The [[Baltimore Sun]]'' published an extensive investigation of U.S. activities in Honduras. Speaking of Negroponte and other senior U.S. officials, an ex-Honduran congressman, Efraín Díaz, was quoted as saying:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cohn|first1=Gary|last2=Thompson|first2=Ginger|title=A Carefully Crafted Deception |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte4-story.html|website=Baltimore Sun|access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref>

<blockquote>Their attitude was one of tolerance and silence. They needed Honduras to loan its territory more than they were concerned about innocent people being killed.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}</blockquote>

Substantial evidence subsequently emerged to support the contention that Negroponte was aware that serious violations of human rights were carried out by the Honduran government, but despite this did not recommend ending U.S. military aid to the country. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Christopher Dodd]] of [[Connecticut]], on September 14, 2001, as reported in the ''Congressional Record'', aired his suspicions on the occasion of Negroponte's nomination to the position of UN ambassador:

<blockquote>Based upon the Committee's review of State Department and [[CIA]] documents, it would seem that Ambassador Negroponte knew far more about government perpetrated human rights abuses than he chose to share with the committee in 1989 or in Embassy contributions at the time to annual State Department Human Rights reports.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/2001_cr/s091401.html |title=Nomination of John Negroponte |work=Congressional Record: (Senate) |date=2001-09-14 |access-date=2006-07-21 |pages=S9431–S9433}}</ref></blockquote>

Among other evidence, Dodd cited a cable sent by Negroponte, in 1985, that made it clear that Negroponte was aware of the threat of "future human rights abuses" by "secret operating cells" left over by General [[Gustavo Álvarez Martínez]], the chief of the Honduran armed forces, after he was forcibly removed from his post by fellow military commanders in 1984.The cables reveal that Negroponte repeatedly urged reform of the Honduran criminal code and justice system to replace arbitrary measures taken by the Honduran government after events such as the blowing up of the nation's main power plant at Tegucigalpa and the kidnapping of the entire business establishment of San Pedro Sula, the second largest city, in 1982.<ref>{{cite book |last=Menzel |first=Sewall |year=2006 |title=Dictators, Drugs & Revolution: Cold War Campaigning in Latin America 1965 - 89 |location=New York |publisher=AuthorHouse |pages=141–43 |isbn=9781425935535 }}</ref> Negroponte's predecessor as Ambassador, Carter appointee Jack Binns has acknowledged that human rights abuses carried out by the Honduran military were fostered by military assistance from the Argentine junta and the C.I.A. during the Carter administration, and that neither the Honduran government nor the CIA kept the embassy informed of what it was doing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Binns |first=Jack |year=2000 |title=The United States in Honduras, 1980–81: An Ambassador's Memoir |location=Jefferson |publisher=McFarland & Company |pages=13, 14, 33, 51, 320–22 |isbn=9780786407347 }}</ref> The scale of the carnage in Honduras was limited to less than 300 'disappearances' during the five years of the Negroponte and Binns ambassadorships as compared with 70,000 lost lives as a result of civil war and repression in El Salvador, notwithstanding that Honduras was involved in a low-level civil war punctuated at times by invasions of its territory.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In April 2005, as the Senate confirmation hearings for the National Intelligence post took place, hundreds of documents were released by the State Department in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The documents, cables that Negroponte sent to Washington while serving as ambassador to Honduras, indicated that he played a more active role than previously known in managing US efforts against the leftist Sandinistas. According to the ''Post'', the image of Negroponte that emerges from the cables is that of an:

<blockquote>exceptionally energetic, action-oriented ambassador whose anti-communist convictions led him to play down human rights abuses in Honduras, the most reliable U.S. ally in the region. There is little in the documents the State Department has released so far to support his assertion that he used "quiet diplomacy" to persuade the Honduran authorities to investigate the most egregious violations, including the mysterious disappearance of dozens of government opponents.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44944-2005Apr11.html |title=Papers Illustrate Negroponte's Contra Role |last=Dobbs |first=Michael |date=2005-04-12 |page=A04 |work=The Washington Post|access-date=2006-07-21}}</ref></blockquote>

The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that the documents revealed:
 
<blockquote>a tough cold warrior who enthusiastically carried out President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s strategy. They show he sent admiring reports to Washington about the Honduran military chief, who was blamed for human rights violations, warned that peace talks with the Nicaraguan regime might be a dangerous "Trojan horse" and pleaded with officials in Washington to impose greater secrecy on the Honduran role in aiding the contras.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}</blockquote>

<blockquote>The cables show that Mr. Negroponte worked closely with [[William J. Casey]], then director of central intelligence, on the Reagan administration's anti-Communist offensive in Central America. He helped word a secret 1983 presidential "finding" authorizing support for the Contras, as the Nicaraguan rebels were known, and met regularly with Honduran military officials to win and retain their backing for the covert action.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B16FE385A0C708DDDAD0894DD404482 |title=Cables Show Central Negroponte Role in 80's Covert War Against Nicaragua |work=The New York Times|date=2005-04-13 |last=Shane |first=Scott |access-date=2006-07-21 |page=A14}} (preview only)</ref></blockquote>

Both papers based their stories on cables obtained by a ''Post'' FOIA request. George Washington University's National Security Archive writes of:

<blockquote>dozens of cables in which the Ambassador sought to undermine regional peace efforts such as the Contadora initiative that ultimately won Costa Rican president [[Oscar Arias]] a Nobel Prize, as well as multiple reports of meetings and conversations with Honduran military officers who were instrumental in providing logistical support and infrastructure for CIA covert operations in support of the contras against Nicaragua—"our special project" as Negroponte refers to the contra war in the cable traffic.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB151/index.htm |title=The Negroponte File: Negroponte's Chron File From Tenure in Honduras Posted |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |date=2005-04-12 |last=Kornbluh |first=Peter}}</ref></blockquote>

Negroponte was opposed to early drafts of peace settlements on the ground that they would have left undisturbed what he described as an enormous threat presented by expansion of the Nicaraguan armed forces with Soviet and Cuban aid. In his tenure in Honduras, Negroponte steered a middle course between State Department and journalistic critics who favored a policy of nonresistance to the militarization of the Sandinista regime to power Nicaragua and its aid to rebel movements in Honduras and El Salvador and 'hard line' persons within the Reagan administration who would have involved the United States in Central America through actions such as blockades, bombing of Nicaraguan airfields, the provision of offensive weapons, and the installation of permanent military bases. A study of American policy has noted that "the United States had a great deal to do with the preservation of Honduran stability. Had it not been for U.S. enticements and pressures elections probably would not have been held in 1980 and 1981. The perpetuation of the military dictatorship would have undermined the legitimacy of the political order, making it far more vulnerable to revolutionary turmoil. By the same token, strong North American opposition to President Suazo's attempt to remain in power in 1985 helped preserve the fragile legitimacy that had been built over the preceding five years ... massive economic aid prevented the economy's collapse ... without the United States, it might well have disintegrated into chaos."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schulz |first1=Donald |last2=Deborah |first2=Sundloff Schulz |year=1994 |title=The United States, Honduras and the Crisis in Central America |url=https://archive.org/details/unitedstateshond00schu/page/321 |location=Boulder |publisher=Westview Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/unitedstateshond00schu/page/321 321] |isbn=9780813313238 }}</ref> Following Bush-Gorbachev meetings beginning in 1986, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union ended military support for 'proxy wars', in Central America, and free elections in Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador followed. Senator Bill Bradley regarded the whole episode as "a minor issue--the supply of arms to the Nicaraguan contras, a policy that took on monumental proportions inside the Beltway and upon those liberals who saw another quagmire in every exercise of military power."<ref>{{cite book |last=Bradley |first=Bill |year=1996 |title=Time Present, Time Past: A Memoir |url=https://archive.org/details/timepresenttimep00bradrich/page/54 |location=New York |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |page=[https://archive.org/details/timepresenttimep00bradrich/page/54 54] |isbn=9780679444886 }}</ref>

===Assistant Secretary for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries (1985&ndash;1989)===
In this posting, Negroponte together with Ambassador Richard Benedick negotiated the Montreal Protocol on Ozone, the most successful modern environmental treaty, overcoming opposition from Europe, Russia, and China and from some Reagan administration officials. (R. Benedick, Ozone Diplomacy: New Directions in Safeguarding the Planet (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard, 1998), 101) He also fostered scientific cooperation with the Soviet Union clashing with 'hard liners' like Richard Perle as well as two treaties relating to cooperation in dealing with nuclear accidents in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Ambassador to Mexico (1989–1993)===
During Negroponte's tour as US Ambassador to Mexico, he was instrumental in persuading the Bush administration to respond to a Mexican initiative by negotiating the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] despite initial opposition by the U.S. Office of Trade Representative. His tenure in Mexico was thus the most consequential of any modern American ambassadorship. It was observed twenty years later that "Every so often, there comes to light a document revealing the foresight of a public servant who grasped the full consequences and implications of a particular government measure or policy. Such a document was written in the spring of 1991 by the then U.S.Ambassador to Mexico, John Negroponte."<ref>Joseph Contreras (2009), "In the Shadow of the Giant: The Americanization of Mexico", pp. 40-42.</ref> Another commentator noted the subsequent proliferation of Negroponte's vision in other free trade agreements.<ref name="mead">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.harpers.org/archive/1992/09/0001004 | title = Bushism, found: A second-term agenda hidden in trade agreements | author = [[Walter Russell Mead]] | magazine = [[Harper's Magazine]]|date = September 1992 | pages = 37–45 | access-date = March 29, 2011 }}</ref> He officiated at the block-long, fortified embassy where he liberalized visa practices.

===Ambassador to the UN (2001&ndash;2004)===
President George W. Bush appointed Negroponte to be U.S. ambassador to the [[United Nations]] in February 2001, and after substantial opposition from Senate Democrats the nomination was ratified by the Senate on September 15, 2001, four days after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the United States.  According to CBS News:

<blockquote>At the United Nations, Negroponte, 64, was instrumental in winning unanimous approval of a Security Council resolution that demanded Saddam Hussein comply with U.N. mandates to disarm.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/13/iraq/main611673.shtml | title = Bush Taps Negroponte For Iraq Post | publisher = [[CBS News]]|date = 2004-04-09 | access-date = 2006-08-17 }}</ref></blockquote>

During [[Colin Powell]]'s speech to the [[Security Council]] on Iraqi [[weapons of mass destruction]], Negroponte could be seen sitting behind Powell's left shoulder. Negroponte, however, had warned the Bush Administration about the adverse consequences of intervening in Iraq.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/01/14/un-ambassador-emerges-as-voice-of-caution-on-iraq/62ae4035-2854-40f9-9703-d991e85d5821/ "U.N. Ambassador Emerges As Voice of Caution on Iraq"], Colum Lynch. Washington Post. January 14, 2003. Retrieved February 16, 2017</ref>

In the ''New York Review of Books'', Stephen Kinzer reported that the messages sent by nominating Negroponte were that "the Bush administration will not be bound by diplomatic niceties as it conducts its foreign policy."  A State Department official told him that "Giving him this job is a way of telling the UN: 'We hate you.'"<ref>

====Ambassador to Iraq (2004–2005)====
[[Image:negroponte iraq.jpg|thumb|John D. Negroponte's remarks at swearing in ceremony as new [[U.S. Ambassador to Iraq]]]]

On April 19, 2004, Negroponte was nominated by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] to be the [[United States Ambassador to Iraq]] after June 30 handover of sovereignty. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on May 6, 2004, by a vote of 95 to 3, and was sworn in on June 23, 2004, replacing [[L. Paul Bremer]] as the U.S.'s highest ranking American civilian in Iraq. He advised the Bush administration that security had to precede reconstruction in Iraq, organized a peaceful election, and gave advice, equally unwelcome to Secretary Rumsfeld and Democrats in Congress, that a five-year commitment would be required.<ref>R.

Reaction in the intelligence community to Negroponte's nomination was, according to ''Newsweek'', "overwhelmingly positive" because he had "earned the respect of many intel professionals since those early days of the Reagan counterinsurgency."<ref name="wwwmsnbcmsncom20050220">{{Citation

Congressional reaction was also positive.  Sen. [[Jay Rockefeller]] (D-WV), then-vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said, "I think that Ambassador Negroponte is a very sound choice. Ambassador Negroponte has served bravely and with distinction in Iraq and at the United Nations during a time of turmoil and uncertainty. He brings a record of proven leadership and strong management." Rep. [[Jane Harman]] (D-CA), then-ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee noted, "John Negroponte is a smart choice for a very important job. He's a seasoned and skilled diplomat, who has served with distinction at the United Nations and in Iraq -- and he has the full confidence of the president."<ref name="wwwcnncom7">{{Citation

|access-date=2007-10-12}}</ref>

According to [[John MacGaffin]], the CIA's former associate deputy director for [[clandestine operation]]s, "This is a guy who plays hardball. He's a man who understands the whole range of counterintelligence, intelligence and covert action. They're all parts of foreign policy and protecting ourselves."<ref name="wwwmsnbcmsncom20050220" /> "We've known for the last 40 years that what's wrong [with intelligence] is that no one's in charge," one retired CIA official told ''Newsweek''. "For once we have a chance to do something with someone truly in charge. Negroponte's going to decide what the answer is."<ref name="wwwmsnbcmsncom20050220" />

As DNI, Negroponte, "embarked on an impressive array of reform efforts," with "perhaps the most transformational work ... [involving] the effort to retool the creaky electronic infrastructure of the intelligence community."<ref name="usnewscDefense" />

According to ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', one of Negroponte's first tests was on an overbudget satellite system.  The $25 billion system, called the "Future Imagery Architecture," was created as the "foundation for the next generation of America's space-based surveillance efforts."  The reality was quite different, as it became, "a managerial nightmare – five years behind schedule and billions over budget.  Poor quality control and technical problems raised questions about whether the system would ever work properly."  Negroponte "moved decisively" and jettisoned half the classified project.<ref name="usnewscDefense" />

Negroponte also appointed "mission managers" – intelligence professionals focused on America's hardest targets and most looming threats.  The mission managers are focused on [[counterterrorism]], [[counterproliferation]], [[counterintelligence]], [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], and [[Cuba]] and [[Venezuela]].<ref name="wwwdnigov12">{{Citation

It has also proven beneficial during potential crises. According to a senior intelligence official quoted in ''U.S. News & World Report'', "In the days after North Korea's recent nuclear test, the DNI put mission manager and CIA veteran [[Joseph DeTrani]] at the center of the developing crisis.  Along with issuing a twice-daily intelligence summary, DeTrani served as a 'traffic cop,' coordinating analysis, briefing the White House, and tasking spies on what to target."<ref name="usnewscDefense" />

In a November 2006 cover story in ''U.S. News & World Report'', it was noted that Negroponte and his office, "have made a promising start – and, remarkably, encountered an apparent willingness to embark on the necessary reforms."<ref name="usnewscDefense" />  Progress made included the White House approval of more than 30 DNI recommendations on improving the flow of intelligence and terrorism data to state and local authorities; requiring intelligence agencies to accept each other's clearance; "open[ing] up the analytic process to new ideas and new people" to prevent groupthink – and the creation of an analytic ombudsman; the establishment of an Open Source center, "designed to broaden the flow of ideas to analysts"; and more "red teams" to challenge conventional thinking.<ref name="usnewscDefense" />
Furthermore, the [[President's Daily Brief]], the highly classified report given to the President each morning by Negroponte, once prepared solely by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], is now compiled from intelligence agencies across the government.  "I believe what I can bring to the community is a sense of what our most important customer is interested in," Negroponte told US News about briefing the president.<ref name="usnewscDefense" />

In spite of his progress leading the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]], though, there were rumors that Negroponte wanted to move back to the field in which he spent 37 years – the [[State Department]] and Foreign Service.<ref name="wwwwashingtonpostcom18">{{Citation

According to ''[[Newsweek]]'', "Under Negroponte, the [[Director of National Intelligence|intel czar]]'s office was praised by both congressional and executive-branch officials for greatly improving—via its National Counterterrorism Center—the sharing among relevant agencies of intelligence reports about terror threats."<ref name=McLaughlin2007-0107 /><ref name="wwwmsnbcmsncom21">{{Citation
