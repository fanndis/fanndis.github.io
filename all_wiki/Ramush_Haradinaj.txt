==Early life and education==
Haradinaj was born on 3 July 1968, as the second of nine children, in the village of Glođane, near [[Dečani]] ({{lang-sq|Deçan}}), in [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]], then part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. His paternal descent is from [[Berisha (tribe)|Berishë]] in northern Albania, around the city of [[Pukë]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kosovalive360.com/ramush-haradinaj-u-nderua-me-cmimin-qytetar-nderi-i-pukes.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=1 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705104415/http://www.kosovalive360.com/ramush-haradinaj-u-nderua-me-cmimin-qytetar-nderi-i-pukes.html|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> He spent his youth in his native village with his parents and siblings, and completed primary school in Rznić ({{lang-sq|Irzniq}}) and secondary school in Dečani and [[Gjakova]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} After graduating from high school in 1987, he did his mandatory military service in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]], where he was later promoted to platoon commander. After the [[Kosovo War]], Haradinaj attended law school at the [[Universiteti i Prishtinës|University of Pristina]].<ref name="BBC03092005">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4329091.stm|title=Profile: Ramush Haradinaj|last=Hawton|first=Nick|date=9 March 2005|work=BBC News Europe|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> Haradinaj also earned a master's degree in business from the [[American University in Kosovo]], which is associated with the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] in [[New York (state)|New York]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Emigration to Switzerland and joining KLA==
In 1989, using a false name, Haradinaj emigrated to [[Leysin]], [[Switzerland]]. He worked there for eight years as a construction worker, security guard, and a bouncer in a nightclub.<ref name="BBC03092005"/> As the Soviet Union dealt with new internal challenges, movements for independence began to form among many of the ethnicities of [[Balkans|the Balkans]] and other states. In Switzerland, Haradinaj joined the Albanian nationalist organization "[[People's Movement of Kosovo]]", from which the KLA originated; this organization wanted to separate Kosovo from Yugoslavia through armed struggle. In 1996, he went through sabotage training in Albania, then participated in the establishment of KLA bases in [[Kukës]] and [[Tropojë]].<ref name="telegraf-436080">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraf.rs/vesti/436080-ko-je-ramus-haradinaj-od-nocnog-izbacivaca-do-premijera|title=KO JE RAMUŠ HARADINAJ: Od noćnog izbacivača do premijera|date=2012-11-29|work=Telegraf}}</ref> According to media outlets, he organized the smuggle of arms into Kosovo; in one of those operations he was ambushed by border patrols, during which he was wounded and his brother Luan was killed.<ref name=telegraf-436080/> In 1998, Haradinaj returned to his hometown of Glođane (now Deçan) in Kosovo.<ref name="From bouncer to prime minister">{{cite news|title=Haradinaj's career: From bouncer to prime minister|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=11&dd=29&nav_id=83404|accessdate=29 November 2012|publisher=B92|date=29 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203053640/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=11&dd=29&nav_id=83404|archive-date=3 December 2012}}</ref>

==Kosovo War==
In February 1998, the conflict in Kosovo erupted. According to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] indictment against [[Fatmir Limaj]], [[Haradin Bala]] and [[Isak Musliu]], between 28 February and 5 March, Serb forces launched an [[Attacks on Likošane and Ćirez|offensive against KLA-held villages of Likošane, Cirez, and Prekaze]].

Serbian special forces attacked three adjacent villages in Drenice. In all 83 Kosovar Albanians were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/limaj/4#tjug |title=ICTY Trial Judgment: The Prosecutor v.

Less than three weeks after the attacks in Drenica, Serbian forces surrounded the village of Glodjane and mounted a similar attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&s=f&o=235663&apc_state=henitri2005|title=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|publisher=IWPR|year=2005|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdhrf.org/English/Weekly/CDHRFReprotNo-401E.pdf|title=REPORT NO.401|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013204957/http://www.cdhrf.org/English/Weekly/CDHRFReprotNo-401E.pdf|archive-date=13 October 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=27 January 2007}}</ref><ref name="Hamzaj 2000">{{cite book|last=Hamzaj|first=Bardh|title=A Narrative of War and Freedom|year=2000|publisher=Zeri|location=Prishtina}}</ref> The Haradinaj family, however, was aware of the previous attacks in Drenice and defended the village.<ref name="Hamzaj 2000"/><ref name="Vanity Fair">{{cite web|last=Langewiesche|first=WIlliam|title=House of War page 4|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/12/kosovo200812?printable=true&currentPage=all|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Vanity Fair|accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref> They utilized their superior knowledge of the terrain and local defenses to good effect and under the leadership of Haradinaj, they successfully repelled the attack.<ref name="Hamzaj 2000"/> This job was made more difficult because Serbian police forces captured a group of civilians and used them as human shields - marching the group in front of Serb soldiers as the forces took cover behind them and attempted to kill the Haradinajs.<ref name="Hamzaj 2000"/><ref name="Vanity Fair"/>

In September 1998, some months later, the bodies of 39 people were found near Glodjane. The victims were local people, of both Albanian and Serbian ethnicities. The discovery of their bodies led to public accusations of war crimes against Haradinaj and his group.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article422280.ece], ''Times Online'' (UK) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316130643/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article422280.ece |date=16 March 2007 }}</ref>

==From soldier to politician==

After demilitarization of the KLA following [[NATO]]'s entry into Kosovo in 1999, the KLA was transformed into the [[Kosovo Protection Corps]] (KPC). In this new force, Haradinaj was appointed as a deputy commander, under [[Agim Çeku]].

He retired from the KPC on 11 April 2000, and announced that he was entering politics. With support from the former communist leader [[Mahmut Bakalli]], Haradinaj founded the [[Alliance for the Future of Kosovo]] (''AAK''), on 29 April 2000. He was elected president of the party.

Following the Kosovo elections of October 2004, Haradinaj entered into coalition talks with the LDK, led by Dr. Rugova, then [[President of Kosovo]]. Rugova formed a government and nominated Haradinaj as [[Prime Minister of Kosovo|Prime Minister]]. In the [[Assembly of Kosovo|Kosovo Assembly]], Haradinaj's candidacy for Prime Minister won the support of 72 members out of 120, with only three opposing.

The PDK opposed Haradinaj's coalition with the Rugova-led LDK. Haradinaj appeared to form a close and productive working relationship with Ibrahim Rugova and other senior figures in the LDK.

In February 2009 the [[Uganda]]n Rebel Group "Allied Democratic Forces", a [[Muslim]] group, asked Haradinaj to mediate peace talks with the central government in [[Kampala]].<ref name="AFP">{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gHTGr8lGZ8gty7Z2Clg4iVt9gYNw|title=Uganda Muslim rebels taps ex-Kosovo PM for peace talks|date=18 February 2009|work=AFP|publisher=AFP|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref>

On 10 November 2012 Albanian President [[Bujar Nishani]] decorated Haradinaj with the [[Skanderbeg's Order]].<ref>[http://www.president.al/?p=4836 Presidenti Nishani dekoron zotin Ramush Haradinaj me Urdhrin “Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208114434/http://president.al/?p=4836 |date=8 February 2013 }}, President of Albania, 2012-12-10 (in Albanian)</ref>

Following the elections in Kosovo in June 2017, Haradinaj was elected Prime Minister of Kosovo on 9 September 2017 as leader of the PANA coalition (PDK-AAK-Nisma-AKR) which also includes Kosovo's ethnic minorities.

==Trial for war crimes at ICTY==

===First trial===
Haradinaj served 100 days as Prime Minister in 2005 before being indicted for [[war crimes]] by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ([[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]]), at [[The Hague]]. The indictment alleges that Haradinaj, as a commander of the KLA, committed [[crimes against humanity]] and violations of the laws or customs of war between March and September 1998, the alleged purpose of which was to exert control over territory, targeting both [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Albanians|Albanian]], and [[Romani people|Romani]] civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/har-rsi070111e.pdf |title=The Prosecutor of the Tribunal against Ramush Haradinaj, Idriz Balaj, Lahi Brahimaj. Revised second amended indictment. |accessdate=2007-02-21 |date=2006-10-11|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409065849/http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/har-rsi070111e.pdf |archive-date=9 April 2008 }}</ref> He was acquitted on 3 April 2008, because of lack of convincing evidence.

When the ICTY indictment was issued in March 2005, Haradinaj chose to step down immediately from his position as Prime Minister. The following day he travelled voluntarily to The Hague where he submitted himself to the custody of the court and remained for two months until he was granted provisional release pending trial. The head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ([[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]) during this time, [[Søren Jessen-Petersen]], welcomed the decision Haradinaj to face the tribunal voluntarily, praised his work and described Haradinaj as a "close partner and friend", regardless Western intelligence reports that Haradinaj was a key figure in the range between [[organized crime]] and politics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dirk Auer and Boris Kanzleiter|title=The "Fist of God" before the UN tribunal Freedom struggle and organized crime in Kosovo|url=http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/dasfeature/720121/http://www.icty.org/sid/8586|publisher=The [[Deutschlandfunk]]|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> Citing Mr. Haradinaj's compliance with the ICTY and the fact that he posed no risk of flight and no risk towards witnesses, the Trial Chamber of the ICTY extended his provisional release and allowed him to wait for trial in his hometown of Prishtina.<ref name="ICTY Press Release">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/8586|title=ICTY Press Release|publisher=ICTY|accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref> Further, the Appeals Chamber later granted Haradinaj the unprecedented right for an indictee to engage in public political activity. Such activity was, however, subject to the approval of UNMIK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/sid/8795|title=ICTY Press Release|publisher=ICTY|accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref> This step was unprecedented in the history of international criminal law and seen as a reflection of the fact that Mr. Haradinaj voluntarily submitted himself to the court. Critics (and the prosecution) however, argued that this went too far. The Prosecution argued that although Mr. Haradinaj posed no threat to witnesses, his mere presence in Kosovo could have a "chilling" effect on whether witnesses would testify.<ref name="ICTY Press Release"/>

On 26 February 2007 Haradinaj was flown back to Hague so that the trial could proceed. In the previous days he held meetings with Kosovo's President [[Fatmir Sejdiu]], Prime Minister [[Agim Çeku]], the head of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, [[Joachim Rücker]], and various diplomatic offices. At a news conference he urged the public to remain calm and was steadfast in his belief that the trial would result in a full acquittal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L23192334.htm|title=A Thomson Reuters Foundation Service |publisher=AlertNet|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2007/02/26/feature-01|title=War crimes indictee Haradinaj urges stability in Kosovo|publisher=SETimes|date=26 February 2007|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2007&mm=02&dd=26&nav_category=113&nav_id=39830|title=Child welfare system at fault?|publisher=B92|year=2007|accessdate=29 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026033101/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2007&mm=02&dd=26&nav_category=113&nav_id=39830|archive-date=26 October 2012}}</ref>

The longtime Chief Prosecutor of International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ([[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]]), [[Carla Del Ponte]], has remained steadfastly unimpressed by the international support for Haradinaj, continuing to make strongly negative statements about him. She told the German [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] that ''"according to the decision to provisionally release him, he is a stability factor for Kosovo. I never understood this. For me he is a war criminal."''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/s/RubFC06D389EE76479E9E76425072B196C3/Doc~E5F799F035A554334BE1ADCA8FA0B9B26~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Del Ponte&nbsp;– Milosevic hat mich fasziniert|publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=20 February 2007|language=de|quote=In der Entscheidung heißt es, er sei ein Sicherheitsfaktor für das Kosovo.

The trial, which was enforced by [[Carla Del Ponte]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/dasfeature/720121/| title=Die "Faust Gottes" vor dem UN-Tribunal|publisher= The [[Deutschlandfunk]]| accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> began on 5 March 2007 and Haradinaj's defence team was led by [[Queen's Counsel]] Ben Emmerson, an international human rights lawyer, who had supporting counsel in Rodney Dixon, also of [[Matrix Chambers]] of London. The legal defence team as a whole was coordinated by Irish political consultant and financier Michael O'Reilly. At the opening of proceedings, Carla Del Ponte pointed to the problems of the accuser. The intimidation of witnesses was a major problem in the investigation. She claimed that it was difficult to find witnesses who were willing to testify not just to the prosecutors, but also for the tribunal. "The difficulty in Kosovo was that no one helped us, neither the UN administration nor NATO."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/s/RubFC06D389EE76479E9E76425072B196C3/Doc~E5F799F035A554334BE1ADCA8FA0B9B26~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Del Ponte&nbsp;– Milosevic hat mich fasziniert|publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=20 February 2007|language=de|quote=Gerade im Kosovo sei es schwer, Zeugen zu finden, die nicht nur vor den Anklägern, sondern auch vor dem Tribunal aussagen wollten. 'Die Schwierigkeit im Kosovo war, daß uns niemand geholfen hat, nicht die UN-Verwaltung und nicht die Nato'.}}</ref>

On 20 July 2007, Ramush Haradinaj's application for provisional release during the summer court recess was denied. He was granted a second exceptional provisional release over the Christmas court recess. The trial chamber rendered its decision on 3 April 2008; not guilty. Defenders of Haradinaj, Balaj and [[Lahi Brahimaj]] have not taken a single witness of the defence to the stand considering that unnecessary. The prosecution was unable to bring to the courtroom three planned witnesses. One of them was committed to a mental health institution at the time he was called to testify. Another, Shefqet Kabashi, refused to testify citing the prosecution's failure to live up to the conditions set for his testimony.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/haradinaj/trialc/judgement/tcj080403e.pdf|title=Icty - Tpiy|publisher=UN|date=5 March 2007|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> Haradinaj's full acquittal, however, was palled by whispers that witnesses had been intimidated. In fact, during the first trial two witnesses failed to attend and it was feared their evidence could have been determinative to the outcome.

The judges addressed the atmosphere of intimidation that surrounded the trial directly and noted: "the Chamber encountered significant difficulties in securing the testimony of a large number of these witnesses. Many cited fear as a prominent reason for not wishing to appear before the Chamber to give evidence. In this regard, the Chamber gained a strong impression that the trial was being held in an atmosphere where witnesses felt unsafe, due to a number of factors set out in the Judgement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1232e-summary.htm|title=Icty - Tpiy|publisher=UN|date=5 March 2007|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>

===Witness intimidation===
{{see also|Kosovo War crimes witness intimidation and murder}}
Because witness intimidation had been such an important issue during the initial trial, witness protection was a prominent feature in both trials. During both trial the Prosecution took great pains to protect the identity of witnesses called to testify. This often included, voice modification, pseudonyms, and in some cases witness relocation. During the retrial, the Court took the extraordinary measure of moving the entire court to an undisclosed secret location in order to secure the testimony of a protected witness.<ref name="Haradinaj Trial Judgment and Summary">{{cite web |title=Haradinaj Trial Judgment and Summary |url=http://icty.org/case/haradinaj/4#tjug |accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Haradinaj Trial Judgment and Summary |url=http://icty.org/case/haradinaj |accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref> These efforts paid off.

The ICTY stated that no witnesses were murdered during either trial.<ref name="Haradinaj Trial Judgment and Summary"/> The judgments of each trial chamber can be found on the ICTY's website: www.icty.org.  There was some confusion over this point because during the first trial, 97 witnesses were called by the Prosecution to testify against Mr. Haradinaj; however, two did not testify, and one witness died shortly before trial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/cases/haradinaj|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122070402/https://www.icty.org/cases/haradinaj|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 January 2020|title=Trial Chamber Judgment|publisher=U.N|date=3 April 2008|accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref> His name was Kujtim Berisha and his death has been used as evidence that witnesses were killed.<ref name="b92.net">{{cite web |title=Hague Tribunal "responsible for deaths of witnesses" |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=11&dd=28&nav_id=83378 |accessdate=30 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201032007/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=11&dd=28&nav_id=83378 |archive-date=1 December 2012}}</ref>

Kujtim Berisha, was killed on 18 February 2007 in a drunk driving car accident in [[Podgorica|Podgorica, Montenegro]]. This accident was ''thoroughly'' investigated by Montenegrin authorities who found that the perpetrator was a 67-year-old Montenegrin Serb named Aleksandar Ristović. Ristović drove his car into Berisha and two other men while under the influence of alcohol. The Montenegrin daily ''[[Vijesti]]'' states that police "confirmed that at the moment of accident Ristović was drunk—driving at a very high speed".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vijesti.cg.yu/naslovna.php?akcija=vijest&id=227818 |title=Ristović u spužu |newspaper=Vijesti |url-status=dead |language=hr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003457/http://www.vijesti.cg.yu/naslovna.php?akcija=vijest&id=227818 |archive-date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>

The ICTY Tribunal confirmed this noting: "The (ICTY) tribunal noted that Kujtim Berisha was "'the only person [who died] who was planned to be called as a witness in the Haradinaj et al. trial.' He died in a 2007 car accident in Podgorica. Montenegrin investigators found 'no evidence that the accident was staged'".<ref name="setimes.com">{{cite web |url=http://setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2011/09/19/feature-03 |work=Southeast Europe Times|title=Key witness in Haradinaj trial sentenced |accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>

The first time the ICTY formally refuted this rumor was shortly after the initial trial. Serbian media claimed that Haradinaj's acquittal was based on the 'mafia style killing of witnesses.' The ICTY Spokeswoman in Serbia, Nerma Jelačić stated that these allegations were untrue and served only to politicize the work of the court.<ref name="Belgrade Reaction to Haradinaj">{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=04&dd=10&nav_id=49272 |title=Belgrade Reaction to Haradinaj Acquittal Concerning |publisher=B92 |date=10 April 2010 |url-status=dead |accessdate=30 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026033127/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=04&dd=10&nav_id=49272 |archive-date=26 October 2012}}</ref> Her statement was later echoed and reaffirmed by the ICTY Trial Chamber itself which commented that no witnesses in the protected witness program were killed during the initial trial.<ref name="setimes.com"/>

The Serbian war crimes prosecutor disagreed with the ICTY. He claimed that potential ICTY witnesses had been murdered in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |work=Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=09&dd=15&nav_id=76403 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130221051620/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=09&dd=15&nav_id=76403 |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 February 2013 |title=Daily of witness intimidation in Haradinaj case |accessdate=30 January 2013 }}</ref> The Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor, however, is not connected with the ICTY in any capacity whatsoever.<ref>{{cite web|title=structure of the Office of the Prosecutor|url=http://www.icty.org/sections/AbouttheICTY/OfficeoftheProsecutor|accessdate=14 April 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429115741/http://icty.org/sections/AbouttheICTY/OfficeoftheProsecutor|archive-date=29 April 2013}}</ref> Instead, he is a Serbian political appointee elected by the Serbian National Assembly who is charged with prosecuting war crimes in Serbia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor|url=http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/o_nama_eng.htm|accessdate=14 April 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404083306/http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/o_nama_eng.htm|archive-date=4 April 2013}}</ref>

===Second trial===
[[File:Supporting Ramush Haradinaj.jpg|thumb|right|Banner to show support for Haradinaj in the streets of Pristina. September 2010]]
The second trial began on 18 August 2011 in front of a second Trial Chamber made up of three different judges. Haradinaj was represented again by Ben Emmerson Q.C, Mr. Rodney Dixon Q.C. and Andrew Strong. The Prosecution called 56 witnesses against Haradinaj and again Haradinaj called no defense witness.

On 29 November 2012, Haradinaj was acquitted a second time.<u><ref>http://www.icty.org/cases/haradinaj{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></u>This time, due to the extreme diligence of the court and of the parties there was no allegation of witness intimidation. Instead the judges found that not only was there no evidence to convict Mr. Haradinaj, the Court held that the evidence established that he had acted to prevent criminal behaviour where he could.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/world/europe/un-court-frees-former-leader-of-kosovo.html | work=The New York Times | first=Marlise | last=Simons | title=U.N. Court Frees Former Leader of Kosovo Ramush Haradinaj | date=29 November 2012}}</ref>

The central allegation against Haradinaj was that he participated in a criminal plan to persecute civilians. The Court directly addressed this allegation and stated in its summary of the judgment that:

"Even if the existence of such common plan were established, which is not the finding of the Chamber, there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that Ramush Haradinaj or Idriz Balaj may have been involved in any such common plan. On the contrary, the evidence establishes that when Ramush Haradinaj found out about the detention and mistreatment of Skender Kuçi, he went to Jabllanicë/Jablanica to speak to Nazmi Brahimaj regarding Skender Kuçi’s release, telling him that "no such thing should happen anymore because this is damaging our cause". When Witness 3 was brought to Ramush Haradinaj after his escape from Jabllanicë/Jablanica and subsequent apprehension by Lahi Brahimaj, Ramush Haradinaj offered food and accommodation to Witness 3 and released him to his family. No credible evidence has been presented by the Prosecution to establish that Ramush Haradinaj was even aware of the crimes committed at the KLA compound in Jabllanicë/Jablanica."

After this ruling, there were serious questions raised as to why Haradinaj was ever indicted in the first place. Indeed, a former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Madonald of River Glaven QC, said: "This prosecution was a stupid attempt to equate resistance with aggression. It was an embarrassment to the international community."<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/02/ramush-haradinaj-kosovo-acquitted | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ed | last=Vulliamy | title=Kosovo (News), Europe (News), World news, Serbia (News), War crimes, Law | date=2 December 2012}}</ref> The governments of both Albania and Kosovo have demanded a public inquiry into the behavior of the Chief Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte over her conduct to bring this indictment forward.<ref>{{cite web|last=Insight|first=Balkan|title=Kosovo And Albania Demand Inquiry into Del Ponte|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/03122012-kosovo-and-albania-demand-inquiry-into-del-ponte/|publisher=Eurasia Review|accessdate=15 October 2013}}</ref>

[[Geoffrey Nice]], the ICTY prosecutor in the Milošević case, wrote in a column in ''[[Koha Ditore]]'' that at least three experienced prosecution lawyers advised Del Ponte against indicting Ramush Haradinaj since it could not be proved he was guilty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=04&dd=10&nav_id=49282|title=Del Ponte almost dropped charges against Milošević|publisher=B92|accessdate=29 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026033153/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=04&dd=10&nav_id=49282|archive-date=26 October 2012}}</ref> One of those lawyers was Andrew T Cayley Q.C. one of the most esteemed lawyers at the Tribunal and currently the Chief Prosecutor at the Cambodian Tribunal. He stated that he felt increasing pressure to bring the case despite an acute lack of evidence.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> Sir Geoffrey Nice Q.C. commented that the pressure to bring the case against Ramush Haradinaj stemmed from the lead Prosecutor at the time, Carla Del Ponte and he speculated that she wanted to use the indictment against Haradinaj as a "coin" to trade with Belgrade in order to convince the Serbian Government to hand over its high-profile war criminal fugitives, [[Radovan Karadžić]] and [[Ratko Mladić]].<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2012/11/30/mixed-international-reactions-to-haradinaj-s-acquittal/|title=Mixed International Reactions to Haradinaj's Acquittal|last=Ristić|first=Marija|date=2012-11-30|work=BalkanInsight}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.helsinki.org.rs/tjtribunal_t12.html|title=Del Ponte destroyed prosecution|date=2007-12-13|work=Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia}}</ref>

After a thorough review of the initial evidence, Andrew T. Cayley Q.C. wrote to the Chief Prosecutor at the time in which he told her that the prosecution could not proceed on the evidence it had.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> That report was immediately discarded and Cayley was reprimanded for his views.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> As a result of the manner in which the chief prosecutor ignored Cayley's advice and pursued the indictment against Haradinaj, three senior prosecutors Geoffery Nice Q.C., Andrew T Cayley Q.C. and Mark Harmon left the office of the Prosecutor.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/>

On 25 April 2008, the ICTY officially opened indictments against Astrit Haraqija and his councilor Bajrush Morina for contempt of court in Haradinaj's case. On 23 July 2009 Astrit Haraqija was acquitted of all charges by the Appeals Chamber.<ref name="icty.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/contempt_haraqija_morina/27#acjug|title=Haraqija & Morina (IT-04-84-R77.4)|website=ICTY}}</ref>
The Court sentenced Bajrush Morina to three months imprisonment for attempting to obstruct a witness from testifying. In rendering its sentence the court acknowledged that there were no aggravating factors that should increase the sentence,<ref name="icty.org"/> The sentence did have mitigating factors, however. These included the fact that the witness Morina was convicted of intimidating stated that the conversation occurred in a "friendly atmosphere", that he never felt intimidated once felt threatened or intimidated, and that Bajrush Morina apologized to the witness immediately after speaking to him and before he was arrested.<ref name="icty.org"/>

In 2009, ''[[The Trial (2009 film)|The Trial]]'', a feature-length documentary on Haradinaj's trial at the ICTY was produced and released.<ref name="Official Website">{{cite web|url=http://www.headlandpictures.com/the-trial-film.html|title=Official Website|publisher=Headlandpictures.com|accessdate=21 July 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208182240/http://www.headlandpictures.com/the-trial-film.html|archive-date=8 February 2011}}</ref> The film premiered at the Galway Film Fleadh in 2009.<ref name="Murphy">{{cite web|url=http://www.galwayfilmfleadh.com/pr_2009.php?p=wednesday/the_trail|title=Feature Documentary, The Trial|last=Murphy|first=John|author2=Rob O’Reilly|accessdate=21 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Arrests in Slovenia and in France==
In June 2015 Haradinaj was arrested by [[Slovenia|Slovene]] police but was released after two days following diplomatic pressure.

On 5 January 2017 Haradinaj was arrested on a Serbian arrest warrant by [[France|French]] border police upon his arrival at [[EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg]] on a flight from [[Pristina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/05/kosovo-former-pm-arrested-in-france-on-serbian-warrant|title=Kosovo former PM arrested in France on Serbian warrant|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref> 
Serbian authorities urged France to extradite Haradinaj urgently, citing that he "Personally took part in the torture, murder, and rape of civilians." The director of the Serbian Office for Kosovo and Metohija, [[Marko Đurić]] said that he was "surprised that Serbia is criticized for something while a criminal like this is free." He added that: "Serbia is sending out a warning that it does not accept fake justice, according to which killings and crimes are allowed if they're in the interest of great powers. As France acts on Serbia's warrants, so we will act on theirs."
Serbian Justice Minister, [[Nela Kuburović]], said that: "The entire international community is under an obligation to prosecute war crimes suspects."<ref>[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2017&mm=01&dd=13&nav_id=100222 Serbia wants France to extradite Haradinaj "urgently"] B92 13. 1. 2017</ref>

In reaction to this event U.S. Representative [[Eliot Engel]] stated "This is not about the rule of law and justice. International courts have freed Mr. Haradinaj twice. This action only increases tensions and increases the possibility of future conflicts. I call on the judicial authorities of France to accelerate the procedure and the release of Mr. Haradinaj as soon as possible". He also stated that "Serbia is abusing the red Interpol notice and thus substantially violating this commitment, the EU should not promote the accession of Serbia until it returns to the path of normalization of relations with Kosovo".<ref name="almakos.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.almakos.com/engel-papranueshem-keqperdorimi-interpolit-nga-serbia |title=Engel: I papranueshëm keqpërdorimi i Interpolit nga Serbia |date=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref name="Radio Slobodna Evropa">{{Cite web |url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/28217892.html |title=Engel: Srbija zloupotrebljava Interpol u slučaju Haradinaj |date= 6 January 2017}}</ref>

On 27 April 2017, a French court turned down a Serbian request to extradite Ramush Haradinaj and released him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/europe/france-kosovo-ramush-haradinaj.html|title=French Court Refuses to Extradite Former Kosovo Leader|last=Breeden|first=Aurelien|date=2017-04-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Election==
{{Main| Second Haradinaj Cabinet}}
Following the 11 June 2017 [[2017 Kosovan parliamentary election|elections]], Haradinaj was elected as the Prime Minister of Kosovo on 9 September 2017, with 61 votes for and 1 abstention after a long political crisis. The rest of the 58 MPs boycotted the vote. His government consisted of a coalition, named the [[PANA Coalition]].

In 2018, Kosovo president [[Hashim Thaçi]] and Serb president [[Aleksandar Vučić]] were supportive of a [[Partition of Kosovo|land-swap between Kosovo and Serbia]] and Haradinaj stated that any change of the Kosovo border with Serbia would trigger and lead to war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/kosovo-premier-warns-border-change-with-serbia-would-mean-war-1.3611717|title=Kosovo premier warns border change with Serbia 'would mean war'|last=McLaughlin|first=Daniel|date=29 August 2018|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Resignation==
On 19 July 2019, Haradinaj resigned after being summoned for questioning by the Specialist Prosecutor's Office in The Hague. He said that he "could not be Kosovo's prime minister and a suspect at the same time". Similar scenarios occurred in April 2008, where he was acquitted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] due to "lack of proof", and in November 2012 by the UN tribunal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2019/07/19/kosovo-pm-resigns-after-hague-prosecutors-call-for-questioning/|title=Kosovo PM Resigns after Summons from Hague Prosecutors|last1=Fazliu|first1=Eraldin|date=2019-07-19|work=BalkanInsight|access-date=2019-07-20|last2=Begisholli|first2=Blerta}}</ref>

==Presidential Bid==
On 12 August 2020, Haradinaj announced that he would run for president.<ref>https://www.gazetaexpress.com/ramush-haradinaj-e-shpall-kandidaturen-per-president/</ref>

In a press release, the steering council of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, AAK, said it had "authorized party leader Haradinaj to hold any talks on behalf of the Alliance on the eventual reconfiguration of the government, including the issue of the president if this is on the agenda.
"The Steering Council has also requested… that in these talks, the candidate for president should be Haradinaj", it added.
On Facebook, Haradinaj said he felt honoured by the party's decision to entrust him with this goal. "I consider the trust that I will be the candidate for president, if this is discussed … a high responsibility and special honour", he wrote.<ref>https://balkaninsight.com/2020/08/13/haradinaj-eyes-succeeding-thaci-as-kosovo-president/</ref>

==Controversies==
In spring 2000, Ramush Haradinaj was involved in a fist fight with [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian soldiers]] at a [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] checkpoint, and later that year was involved in a shootout in Strellc with members of the Musaj family (members of the FARK), which was covered up by US officials of [[Camp Bondsteel]].<ref name=US-coverup>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/10/balkans.internationalcrime|title=US 'covered up' for Kosovo ally|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=16 December 2012|location=London|date=9 September 2000}}</ref> He was injured, and sent by a US helicopter to Germany, while the location, long from US area of responsibility, was cleansed of evidence.<ref name=US-coverup/>

It is alleged that he beat the soldiers under his command in order to maintain discipline, and was described as "a psychopath" by one of his former soldiers.<ref name=US-coverup/>

==Family and personal life==
Haradinaj's ancestors originated from [[Iballë]], [[Pukë]] in Northern Albania, who later then migrated to [[Kosovo]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kosovalive360.com/ramush-haradinaj-u-nderua-me-cmimin-qytetar-nderi-i-pukes.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705104415/http://www.kosovalive360.com/ramush-haradinaj-u-nderua-me-cmimin-qytetar-nderi-i-pukes.html |archive-date=5 July 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
His father, mother and remaining family member still reside in the family home in the community of Glodjane. Ramush Haradinaj is currently married to the [[Radio Television of Kosovo|RTK]] news reporter Anita Haradinaj, they have three young children, two boys and one girl.

Haradinaj has five brothers. Two of them, [[Luan Haradinaj]] and [[Shkelzën Haradinaj]], were killed as members of the KLA during the fights with the Serbian security forces. In December 2002, Haradinaj's brother Daut was sentenced by a [[UN]] court in Kosovo for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of four Kosovo Albanians, who belonged to the [[Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosovo|FARK]], an armed formation of Kosovo Albanians and rivals of the KLA, to five years in prison. Enver Haradinaj, another brother of Ramush, was assassinated in April 2005 in a drive-by shootout in Kosovo. According to the UN security forces, there was a confrontation between rival Kosovo-Albanian clans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/comments.php?nav_id=31799 |title=Ramush Haradinaj's brother murdered |publisher=B92 |url-status=dead |accessdate=30 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026033203/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/comments.php?nav_id=31799 |archive-date=26 October 2012}}</ref> The youngest brother Frashër was still a student as of 2007 and worked in the service of the now former Provisional Institutions of Self-Government.
