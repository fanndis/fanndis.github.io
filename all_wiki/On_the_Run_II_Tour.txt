==Critical response==
[[File:Beyonce in Rome.jpg|thumb|Beyoncé in Rome]]
The opening show in Cardiff received positive reviews. Mark Sutherland from ''Rolling Stone'' gave the opening show in Cardiff a positive review. He called it a sort of reaffirmation of dominance for the pair as they deliver a "a hits-packed, visually stunning show".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-beyonce-is-asserting-her-dominance-at-on-the-run-ii-w521221|title=5 Ways Beyonce Is Asserting Her Dominance at the 'On the Run II' Tour|work=Rolling Stone|first=Brittany|last=Spanos|date=June 7, 2018|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref> Writing for ''The Guardian'', Rachel Aroesti awarded the concert four out of five stars and noted that the concept of the show revolved around the singers showing the "deathless nature of their love rather than its perfection".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/07/beyonce-jay-z-otr-ii-tour-review-opening-night-cardiff|title=Beyoncé & Jay-Z: OTR II review – heart-stopping scenes from a marriage|first=Rachel|last=Aroesti|date=June 7, 2018|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref> Beyoncé was critiqued after some of her "biggest hits" were left out of the set list on the opening night, including "[[Halo (Beyoncé song)|Halo]]" and "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]". However, with over 60 songs rehearsed for the tour, the set list was believed to change between shows.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44384522|title=Beyonce and Jay-Z loved-up as tour begins|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=2018-06-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-GB}}</ref>
Bonginkosi Tshabalala of ''No Name'' publications added that the show at Houston proved that "no matter what happens LOVE wins".
