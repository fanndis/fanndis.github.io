The '''Most Excellent Order of the British Empire''' is a British [[order of chivalry]], rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences, work with charitable and welfare organisations, and public service outside the [[civil service]].<ref name="obe_royal">{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/OrderoftheBritishEmpire.aspx |title=Order of the British Empire |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--> |website=The Official Website of the British Monarchy |publisher=The Royal Household |accessdate=24 August 2009|archivedate=27 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327214051/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/OrderoftheBritishEmpire.aspx}}</ref> It was established on 4 June 1917 by [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King]] [[George V]] and comprises five classes across both civil and military divisions, the most senior two of which make the recipient either a [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Modern honours|knight]] if male or [[dame (title)|dame]] if female.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30250|supp=2|date=24 August 1917|pages=8791–8999}}</ref> There is also the related [[British Empire Medal]], whose recipients are affiliated with, but not members of the order.

Recommendations for appointments to the Order of the British Empire were originally made on the nomination of the United Kingdom, the self-governing [[Dominion]]s of the Empire (later Commonwealth) and the [[Viceroy of India]]. Nominations continue today from Commonwealth countries that participate in recommending British (Imperial) honours. Most Commonwealth countries ceased recommendations for appointments to the Order of the British Empire when they created their own honours.{{efn|The last Canadian recommendation for the Order of the British Empire was an MBE for gallantry gazetted in 1966, a year before the creation of the Order of Canada. The Australian Honours System unilaterally created in 1975 did not achieve bi-partisan support until 1992 when  Australian federal and state governments agreed to cease Australian recommendations for British honours. The last Australian recommended Order of the British Empire appointments were in the 1989 Queen’s Birthday Honours. New Zealand ceased to use the order when it introduced its own honours system.}}

==Current classes==
The five classes of appointment to the Order are, in descending order of precedence:<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is the difference between a CBE, OBE, MBE and a knighthood?|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/awards-and-accreditation/content/103372|access-date=2020-08-19|website=www.thegazette.co.uk|language=en}}</ref>
# '''GBE''' – [[Grand Cross|Knight Grand Cross]] or Dame Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire{{efn|It is commonly written without "of the Most Excellent Order" and other words not implied by the post-nominals.}}
# '''KBE or DBE''' – [[Knight Commander]] or Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire
# '''CBE''' – Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire 
# '''OBE''' – Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire 
# '''MBE''' – Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire

==Styles and honorary knighthoods==
The senior two ranks of Knight or Dame Grand Cross, and Knight or Dame Commander, entitle their members to use the title of ''Sir'' for men and ''Dame'' for women before their forename. Most members are citizens of the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth realms that use the Imperial system of honours and awards.

When the recipient is not a citizen of a country where [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] is [[head of state]], they receive an honorary knighthood. They may permit use of post-nominal letters but not the title of ''Sir'' or ''Dame''. Occasionally, honorary appointees are incorrectly referred to as Sir or Dame. Honorary appointees who later become a citizen of a Commonwealth realm can convert their appointment from honorary to substantive, then enjoy all privileges of membership of the order, including use of the title of ''Sir'' and ''Dame'' for the senior two ranks of the Order. An example is Irish broadcaster [[Terry Wogan]], who was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Order in 2005, and on successful application for British citizenship, held alongside his Irish citizenship, was made a substantive member and subsequently styled as Sir Terry Wogan.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=57855|date=31 December 2005|page=26|supp=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4503018.stm|title=Radio's Wogan becomes Sir Terry|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line-->|date=6 December 2005|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:MBE-Cobh-Heritage-Centre-2012.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|MBE (civil division) as awarded in 1918]]
[[File:Ster Orde van het Britse Rijk.jpg|thumb|[[Knight Grand Cross|Grand Cross]] Star of the Order of the British Empire]]
[[File:Mbe Cpt Masterman 05-02-2010.jpg|thumb|Close-up of an MBE from 1945 showing the "For God and the Empire"]]

[[George V|King George V]] founded the Order to fill gaps in the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|British honours system]]:

* The Orders of the [[Order of the Garter|Garter]], the [[Order of the Thistle|Thistle]], and [[Order of St Patrick|St Patrick]] honoured royals, peers, statesmen, and eminent military commanders;
* The [[Order of the Bath]] honoured senior military officers and civil servants;
* The [[Order of St Michael and St George]] honoured diplomats and colonial officials;
* The [[Order of the Star of India]] and the [[Order of the Indian Empire]] honoured Indian rulers and British and Indian officials of the [[British Indian Empire]]; and
* The [[Royal Victorian Order]], in the personal gift of the monarch, honoured those who had personally served the royal family.
In particular, King George V wished to create an Order to honour many thousands of those who had served in a variety of non-combatant roles during the [[First World War]]. When first established, the Order had only one division. However, in 1918, soon after its foundation, it was formally divided into Military and [[Civil service|Civil]] Divisions.{{explain|date=June 2020}}<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31084|page=15135|date=27 December 1918}}</ref> The Order's motto is ''For God and the Empire''.<ref name="obe_royal"/>

At the foundation of the Order, the 'Medal of the Order of the British Empire' was instituted, to serve as a lower award granting recipients affiliation but not membership. In 1922, this was renamed the '[[British Empire Medal]]' (BEM). It stopped being awarded by the United Kingdom as part of the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Reform|1993 reforms]] to the honours system, but was again awarded beginning in 2012, starting with 293 BEMs awarded for [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-18456068|title=Birthday Honours: 'Working class' British Empire Medal revived|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=16 June 2012 |accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref> In addition, the BEM is awarded by the [[Cook Islands]] and by some other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations. 

In 2004, a report titled "A Matter of Honour: Reforming Our Honours System" by a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]] committee recommended to phase out the Order of the British Empire, as its title was "now considered to be unacceptable, being thought to embody values that are no longer shared by many of the country's population".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/212/212.pdf|title=A Matter of Honour: Reforming Our Honours System|work=House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee|publisher=Parliament.uk|date=13 July 2004|accessdate =15 January 2016}}</ref>

==Composition==
The [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] is Sovereign of the Order, and appoints all other members of the Order (by convention, on the advice of the governments of the United Kingdom and some [[Commonwealth realm]]s). The next most senior member is the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]], of whom there have been three: [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII)]] (1917–1936); [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] (1936–1953); and the current Grand Master, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] (since 1953).

The Order is limited to 300 Knights and Dames Grand Cross, 845 Knights and Dames Commander, and 8,960 Commanders. There are no limits applied to the total number of members of the fourth and fifth classes, but no more than 858 Officers and 1,464 Members may be appointed per year. Foreign appointees, as honorary members, do not contribute to the numbers restricted to the Order as full members do. Although the Order of the British Empire has by far the highest number of members of the British Orders of Chivalry, with over 100,000 living members worldwide, there are fewer appointments to knighthoods than in other orders.<ref name="obe_royal"/>

Though men can be [[Knight Bachelor|knighted separately from an order of chivalry]] (Knight Bachelor), women cannot, and so the rank of Knight/Dame Commander of the Order is the lowest rank of damehood, and second-lowest of knighthood (above Knights Bachelor). Because of this, an appointment as Dame Commander is made in circumstances in which a man would be created a Knight Bachelor. For example, by convention, female judges of the [[High Court of Justice]] are created Dames Commander after appointment, while male judges become Knights Bachelor.

From time to time, individuals are appointed to a higher grade within the Order, thereby ceasing usage of the junior post-nominal letters.

===Officers===
The Order has six offices:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.centralchancery.org.uk/Content/documents/OBE%20Newsletter%20Dec2015.pdf|title=The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire : Newsletter|date=December 2015|website=Centralchancerry.org.uk|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> The King of Arms is not a member of the [[College of Arms]], as are many other [[heraldry|heraldic]] officers. [[Gentleman Usher of the Purple Rod]] does not – unlike the [[Order of the Garter]] equivalent, the [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]] – perform any duties related to the [[House of Lords]].

* '''Prelate''': [[Bishop of London]], the Rt Hon. & Rt Rev. Dame [[Sarah Mullally]] {{postnominals|country=GBR|DBE}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/3162918|title=Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood|last=HM Government|date=2018-12-07|website=The London Gazette|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref>

==Gallantry==
[[File:Order of the British Empire for gallantry, oak leaves ribbon emblem.jpg|145px|thumb|right|OBE silver oak-leaf emblem for gallantry]]
Although initially intended to recognise meritorious service, the Order began to also be awarded for gallantry. There were an increased number of cases in the [[Second World War]] for service personnel and civilians including the merchant navy, police, emergency services and civil defence, mostly MBEs but with a small number of OBEs and CBEs. Such awards were for gallantry that did not reach the standard of the [[George Medal]], but, as an Order, were listed before it on the Order of Wear. Awards for meritorious service usually appear without a citation but there were often citations for gallantry awards, some detailed and graphic.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Abbott, PE |author2=Tamplin, J.M.A. |title=British Gallantry Awards |date=1981 |publisher=Nimrod Dix & Co. |location=[[London]] |isbn=978-0-902633-74-2}} Chapters 35–38.</ref> From 14 January 1958, these awards were designated Commander, Officer or Member of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry.<ref name=LG1958>{{London Gazette|issue=41285|page=365|date=14 January 1958 |supp=y}}</ref>

Any individual made a member of the Order for gallantry after 14 January 1958 wears an emblem of two crossed silver oak leaves on the same ribbon as the badge, with a miniature version on the ribbon bar when worn alone. When the ribbon only is worn the emblem is worn in miniature.<ref name=LG1958/> It could not be awarded [[posthumous award|posthumously]], and was replaced in 1974 with the [[Queen's Gallantry Medal]] (QGM). If recipients of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry received promotion within the Order, whether for gallantry or otherwise, they continued to wear also the insignia of the lower grade with the oak leaves.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=56878|page=3353|date=17 March 2003 |supp=y}}</ref> However, they only used the post-nominal letters of the higher grade.

==Vestments and accoutrements==
Members of the Order wear elaborate vestments on important occasions (such as quadrennial services and [[coronation of the British monarch|coronations]]), which vary by rank (the designs underwent major changes in 1937):
* The ''mantle'', worn by only Knights and Dames Grand Cross, was originally made of yellow satin lined with blue silk, but is now made of rose pink satin lined with pearl-grey silk. On the left side is a representation of the star (see below).
* The ''collar'', also worn by only Knights and Dames Grand Cross, is made of gold. It consists of six medallions depicting the Royal Arms, alternating with six medallions depicting the Royal and Imperial Cypher of George V (''GRI'', which stands for "''{{Lang|la|Georgius Rex Imperator}}''"). The medallions are linked with gold cables depicting lions and crowns.

</gallery>

On certain "[[collar day]]s" designated by the Sovereign, members attending formal events may wear the Order's collar over their military uniform, formal day dress, or evening wear. When collars are worn (either on collar days or on formal occasions such as coronations), the badge is suspended from the collar. Collars are returned upon the death of their owners, but other insignia may be retained.

At less important occasions, simpler insignia are used:

* The ''star'' is an eight-pointed silver star used by only Knights and Dames Grand Cross and Knights and Dames Commander. It is worn pinned to the left breast. Varying in size depending on class, it bears a crimson ring with the motto of the Order inscribed. Within the ring, a figure of [[Britannia]] was originally shown. Since 1937, however, the effigies of George V and Mary of Teck have been shown instead.
* The ''badge'' is the only insignia used by all members of the Order. Until 1937, it was suspended on a purple ribbon, with a red central stripe for the military division; since then, the ribbon has been rose-pink with pearl-grey edges, with the addition of a pearl-grey central stripe for the military division. Knights and Dames Grand Cross wear it on a riband or sash, passing from the right shoulder to the left hip. Knights Commander and male Commanders wear the badge from a ribbon around the neck; male Officers and Members wear the badge from a ribbon on the left chest; all females other than Dames Grand Cross wear it from a bow on the left shoulder. The badge is in the form of a ''cross [[wikt:patonce|patonce]]'' (having the arms growing broader and floriated toward the end), the obverse of which bears the same field as the star (that is, either Britannia or [[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]); the reverse bears George V's Royal and Imperial Cypher. Both are within a ring bearing the motto of the Order. The size of the badges varies according to rank: the higher classes have slightly larger badges. The badges of Knights and Dames Grand Cross, Knights and Dames Commander and Commanders are enamelled with pale blue crosses and crimson rings; those of Officers are plain gold; those of Members are plain silver.
* The ''British Empire Medal'' is made of silver. On the obverse is an image of Britannia surrounded by the motto, with the words "For Meritorious Service" at the bottom; on the reverse is George V's Imperial and Royal Cypher, with the words "Instituted by King George V" at the bottom. The name of the recipient is engraved on the rim. This medal is nicknamed 'the Gong', and comes in both a full-sized and miniature versions – the latter for formal white-tie and informal black-tie occasions.
* A [[Award pin|lapel pin]] for everyday wear was first announced at the end of December 2006, and is available to recipients of all levels of the Order, as well as to holders of the [[British Empire Medal]]. The pin design is not unique to any level. The pin features the badge of the Order, enclosed in a circle of ribbon of its colours of pink and grey. Lapel pins must be purchased separately by a member of the Order.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emblem for honours (Archived 4 April 2012)|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Honoursawardsandmedals/DG_067923|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120404103105/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Honoursawardsandmedals/DG_067923|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 April 2012|website=The National Archives|publisher=DirectGov (UK)|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> The creation of such a pin was recommended in Sir [[Hayden Phillips]]' review of the honours system in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|title=BEM Recipients Entitled to New Emblem|url=http://www.berwickshirenews.co.uk/news/local-news/all-local-news/bem-recipients-entitled-to-new-emblem-1-241213|publisher=The Berwickshire News|date=12 November 2008|accessdate=26 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729200444/http://www.berwickshirenews.co.uk/news/local-news/all-local-news/bem-recipients-entitled-to-new-emblem-1-241213|archive-date=29 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Chapel==
[[File:St-Pauls-Cathedral London Crypta Chapel-Order-Of-The-British-Empire-01.jpg|thumb|Chapel of the Order in the [[crypt]] of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]]]
The chapel of the Order is in the far eastern end of the crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], but it holds its great services upstairs in the main body of the cathedral. (The cathedral also serves as the home of the chapel of [[Order of St Michael and St George|The Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George]].) Religious services for the whole Order are held every four years; new Knights and Dames Grand Cross are installed at these services. The chapel was dedicated in 1960.

==Precedence and privileges==
{{see also|Order of precedence in England and Wales}}
[[File:Order of the British Empire - Non Arms.svg|thumb|Knights, Dames and Commanders of the [[OBE|Order]] may display its [[circlet]] around (and suspend its [[Heraldic badge|Badge]] below) their [[coat of arms]].]]
Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commander prefix ''Sir'', and Dames Grand Cross and Dames Commander prefix ''Dame'', to their forenames.{{efn|Never surnames – thus Sir [[Antony Sher]] may be shortened to Sir Antony, but not to Sir Sher.}} Wives of Knights may prefix ''Lady'' to their surnames, but no equivalent privilege exists for spouses of Knights or husbands of Dames. Such forms are not used by peers and princes, except when the names of the former are written out in their fullest forms. Male clergy of the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church of Scotland]] do not use the title ''Sir'' as they do not receive the [[accolade]] (they are not dubbed "knight" with a sword), although they do append the [[post-nominal letters]]: dames do not receive the accolade, and therefore female clergy are free to use the title ''Dame''.

Knights and Dames Grand Cross use the post-nominal, GBE; Knights Commander, KBE; Dames Commander, DBE; Commanders, CBE; Officers, OBE; and Members, MBE. The post-nominal for the British Empire Medal is BEM.

Members of all classes of the Order are assigned positions in the [[Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom|order of precedence]]. Wives of male members of all classes also feature on the order of precedence, as do sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commander; relatives of Ladies of the Order, however, are not assigned any special precedence. As a general rule, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives.

Knights and Dames Grand Cross are also entitled to be granted [[Supporters (heraldry)|heraldic supporters]]. They may, furthermore, encircle their arms with a depiction of the [[circlet]] (a circle bearing the motto) and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. Knights and Dames Commander and Commanders may display the circlet, but not the collar, surrounding their arms. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar or circlet.

==Recommendations by Commonwealth countries==
[[File:Countries awarding the Order of the British Empire (2020).svg|thumb|Countries making recommendations to the Order of the British Empire (2020)]]
{{Main|Orders and decorations of the Commonwealth realms}}

Recommendations for appointments to the Order of the British Empire continue to be made by most smaller Commonwealth realms. In 2019, [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Grenada]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Saint Christopher and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and [[Tuvalu]], as well as the [[New Zealand]] associated state of the [[Cook Islands]] all included Order of the British Empire awards in their New Year's and/or Queen's Birthday honours lists.<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/awards-and-accreditation/content/100138|Commonwealth New Year and Birthday Honours]. The Gazette, Retrieved 19 May 2020.</ref> 

However, since the Second World War, several [[Commonwealth realm]]s have established their own national system of honours and awards and have created their own unique orders, decorations and medals. 

Canada seldom made recommendations for appointments to the Order of the British Empire except for the Second World War and Korea but continued to recommend gallantry awards for both military and civilians until the creation of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1967.<ref>However, there were awards of the related British Empire Medal for Gallantry, whose recipients are affiliated with, but not members of the Order of the British Empire, after the creation of the Order of Canada. see {{London Gazette|issue=44630|page=7607|date=9 July 1968}}</ref> 

Although [[Australian Commonwealth|Commonwealth of Australia]] recommendations ended with the creation of the [[Order of Australia]] in 1975, [[Australian State|State]] governments continued to recommend the Order of the British Empire until the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours, nearly 15 years later.<ref>''London Gazette'' 51778, Sat, 17 June 1989, p. 45</ref> 

The New Zealand Government ceased to recommend the Order after the establishment of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]] in 1996, but the Government of the Cook Islands continues to do so.<ref>[https://dpmc.govt.nz/our-programmes/new-zealand-royal-honours/new-zealand-royal-honours-system/history|The New Zealand Royal Honours System: History], Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Retrieved on 19 May 2020</ref>

==Criticism==

In 2003, the ''Sunday Times'' published a list of the people who had rejected the Order of the British Empire, including [[David Bowie]], [[John Cleese]], [[Nigella Lawson]], [[Elgar Howarth]], [[L. S. Lowry]], [[George Melly]] and [[J. G. Ballard]].<ref name = mcgavin>{{Cite web|first=Henry|last=McGavin|date=22 December 2003|title=Honoured?

The Order has attracted some criticism for its naming having connection with the idea of the now-extinct [[British Empire]].<ref name=FifthReport>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/212/21209.htm A reformed Honours system], Select Committee on Public Administration, 7 July 2004, Retrieved 13 May 2012</ref> [[Benjamin Zephaniah]], a [[British Jamaican]] poet, publicly rejected appointment as an Officer in 2003 because, he asserted, it reminded him of "thousands of years of brutality". He also said that "It reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers brutalised".<ref>{{Cite web|first=Merope|last=Mills|date=27 November 2003|title=Rasta poet publicly rejects his OBE|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/27/iraq.monarchy|website=The Guardian|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref>

In 2004, a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] recommended changing the name of the award to the ''Order of British Excellence'', and changing the rank of ''Commander'' to ''Companion''; as the former was said to have a "militaristic ring".<ref name=FifthReport/><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3888581.stm "Honours system outdated, say MPs"], BBC News, 13 July 2004, Retrieved 28 February 2007</ref>

A notable person to decline the offer of membership was the author [[C. S. Lewis]] (1898–1963), who had been named on the last list of honours by [[George VI]] in December 1951. Despite being a [[monarchist]], he declined so as to avoid association with any political issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cslewis.org/resources/chronocsl.html |title=Chronology of the Life of C.S. Lewis |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206021046/http://www.cslewis.org/resources/chronocsl.html |archivedate=6 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name="Letters of C.S.

[[The Beatles]] were appointed Members in 1965: [[John Lennon]] justified the comparative merits of his investiture by comparing military membership in the Order: "Lots of people who complained about us receiving the MBE [status] received theirs for heroism in the war&nbsp;— for killing people&nbsp;... We received ours for entertaining other people. I'd say we deserve ours more." Lennon later returned his MBE insignia on 25 November 1969, as part of his ongoing peace protests.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian Roylance|author2=George Harrison|author3=John Lennon|author4=Paul McCartney|author5=Ringo Starr|title=The Beatles Anthology|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2000|pages=[https://archive.org/details/beatlesanthology0000unse/page/183 183]|isbn=978-0-8118-2684-6|url=https://archive.org/details/beatlesanthology0000unse/page/183}}</ref> Other criticism centres on the claim that many recipients of the Order are being rewarded with honours for simply doing their jobs; critics claim that the Civil Service and Judiciary receive far more orders and honours than leaders of other professions.<ref name=FifthReport/>

[[Chin Peng]], a veteran guerrilla fighter of the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army]], was appointed as an Officer for his role in fighting against the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]] during [[World War II]], in close co-operation with the British commando [[Force 136#Malayan Communist Party|Force 136]]. Several years after World War II his OBE membership was withdrawn by the British government and became undesirable to Chin Peng as well when the Communist leader headed his party's guerrilla insurgency against the British Empire during the [[Malayan Emergency]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,806357,00.html Dead or Alive],{{subscription required}} ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine, 12 May 1952</ref>
