'''Mackay Memorial Hospital''' ({{zh|t=馬偕紀念醫院|p=Mǎjiē Jìniàn Yīyuàn}}), established on 26 December 1912, is one of the largest medical centers in Taiwan. It is a private Christian hospital in [[Zhongshan District, Taipei|Zhongshan District]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], mostly associated with [[George Leslie Mackay]], the first modern [[missionary]] to northern Taiwan. The [[hospital]] is deeply rooted in the [[Presbyterian]] tradition and under the spiritual guidance of the [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]].

==History==
The original Mackay Hospital — named Mackay Clinic — was built by Mackay in [[Tamsui]] in 1880 and named to commemorate [[George Leslie Mackay]], whose widow donated the funds.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mackay |first=George L. |authorlink=George Leslie Mackay |year=1896 |title=From Far Formosa: the island, its people and missions |place=New York |publisher=F. H. Revell Co. |URL=https://archive.org/details/fromfarformosais00mackrich |page=316}}</ref> At that time, the Mackay Clinic was the first western medical institution in northern Taiwan. It was temporarily closed in 1901 at the death of Mackay.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Han Cheung|title=Taiwan in Time: Healing and preaching|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/12/25/2003661872/2|accessdate=25 December 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=25 December 2016}}</ref>

Mackay Hospital was reopened in 1906. In 1912, it was relocated from Tamsui to [[Taipei]] and renamed Mackay Memorial Hospital.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Chronicle of Events|url=http://eng.mmh.org.tw/dnn/AboutMackay/AChronicleofEvents/tabid/179/language/zh-TW/Default.aspx|accessdate=25 December 2016|publisher=Mackay Memorial Hospital}}</ref> Its logo bears the date of the original foundation: 1880.

In 1967, the hospital built the first [[intensive care unit]] in Taiwan and, two years later, the first suicide prevention center in Southeast Asia. In 1994, it established the first demonstration burn ward in Taiwan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Surgeons for Smiles|url=https://www.taiwantoday.tw/fp.asp?xItem=1079&CtNode=2196|accessdate=25 December 2016|work=Taiwan Today|date=1 May 2005}}</ref>
