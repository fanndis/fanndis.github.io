==History==
The 2008 ceremonies were not held due to several factors, including the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]], the ill health of [[Don Cornelius]] at the time, and ''Soul Train'' distributor [[Tribune Entertainment]] terminating operations in the wake of the sale of [[Tribune Media]] to [[Sam Zell]]. With the rights to ''Soul Train'' acquired by MadVision Entertainment, the Soul Train Music Awards were presented on November 24, 2009 on [[BET Her]].  MadVision now holds the [[rerun]] rights to ''Soul Train''.

The 2009 ceremony was held at the [[Georgia World Congress Center]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], marking the first time in the show's 22-year history it was held outside of the [[Greater Los Angeles]].  The 2010 awards was held on November 10 just outside Atlanta at the [[Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre]], and aired November 28.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/radio-tv-talk/2010/07/14/soul-train-awards-returning-to-atlanta-november-10|title=Soul Train Awards Returning to Atlanta, November 10th|newspaper=AJC.com|date=July 14, 2010|accessdate=July 14, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719123245/http://blogs.ajc.com/radio-tv-talk/2010/07/14/soul-train-awards-returning-to-atlanta-november-10/|archivedate=July 19, 2010}}</ref> The 2011 show was once again held in Atlanta and aired November 27.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/radio-tv-talk/2011/07/05/sixth-annual-bet-hip-hop-awards-soul-train-awards-will-return-to-atlanta/?cxntlid=thbz_hm|title=Sixth Annual BET Hip-Hop Awards and Soul Train Awards will Return to Atlanta|newspaper=AJC.com|date=July 5, 2011|accessdate=July 5, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105184038/http://blogs.ajc.com/radio-tv-talk/2011/07/05/sixth-annual-bet-hip-hop-awards-soul-train-awards-will-return-to-atlanta/?cxntlid=thbz_hm|archivedate=November 5, 2013}}</ref> The 2012 ceremony was held live on November 25 at [[Planet Hollywood Las Vegas]] in [[Las Vegas Valley]], [[Nevada]].

==Soul Cypher==
In 2015, host [[Erykah Badu]] added a new tradition to the award show, the Soul Cypher. Similar to a Hip-Hop [[Freestyle rap|cypher]], it features a quartet of R&B/Soul/Gospel singers coming together to perform a freestyle. Accompanied by an instrumental beat and a live band, the artists deliver a freestyle arrangement by incorporating lyrics, hooks and/or titles from their popular hits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lalah Hathaway, Eddie Levert, Chrisette Michele & K-Ci Rock Over “Shook Ones” At Soul Train Awards Soul Cypher|url=https://www.okayplayer.com/news/lalah-hathaway-eddie-levert-chisette-michelle-k-ci-soul-train-awards-soul-cypher-video.html/|work=[[Okayplayer]]|date=December 1, 2020}}</ref>

==Trophy==
The original trophy is a bronze abstract sitting figure known as the Vanguard in 1987. However, the trophy is an African mask which is known as the Heritage Award. Its distinctive design created by an unknown sculptor, but its remains a visual trademark for Soul Train's representation of Black music.

From 1989 to 2007, the Heritage mask remained the trophy for Soul Train Music Awards until 2009 when BET and its sister channel Centric revived the awards. Thunderdog designed a brand new trophy based on the program's mascot, an actual train.
