'''George VI''' (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895&nbsp;– 6 February 1952) was [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Commonwealth]] from 11 December 1936 until his death in 1952. He was also [[Emperor of India]] from 1936 until 1947, when the [[British Raj]] was dissolved.

Known as "Bertie" among his family and close friends, George VI was born in the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]] and was named after his great-grandfather [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. As the second son of [[King George V]], he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. He attended naval college as a teenager and served in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[First World War]]. In 1920, he was made [[Duke of York]]. He married [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923, and they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]]. In the mid-1920s, he had speech therapy for a [[stammer]], which he learned to manage to some degree. George's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII after their father died in 1936. Later that year, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] to marry the American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]], and George became the third monarch of the [[House of Windsor]].

In September 1939, the [[British Empire]] and Commonwealth—[[Irish neutrality during World War II|except Ireland]]—declared [[World War II|war]] on [[Nazi Germany]]. War with the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. George was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. [[Buckingham Palace]] was bombed during [[the Blitz]] while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent]], was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. [[Allies of World War II|Britain and its allies]] were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had [[Adoption of the Constitution of Ireland|largely broken away]], followed by [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India and Pakistan]] in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died of [[coronary thrombosis]] in 1952. He was succeeded by his daughter, [[Elizabeth II]].

==Early life==
[[File:Edward VII UK and successors.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Four kings: [[Edward VII]] (far right); his son George, Prince of Wales, later [[George V]] (far left); and grandsons Edward, later [[Edward VIII]] (rear); and Albert, later George VI (foreground), c. 1908]]

The future George VI was born at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Rhodes James, p. 90; Weir, p. 329</ref> His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later [[King George V]]), the second and eldest surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]]). His mother, the Duchess of York (later [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]), was the eldest child and only daughter of [[Francis, Duke of Teck]], and [[Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck]].<ref>Weir, pp. 322–323, 329</ref> His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, [[Albert, Prince Consort]].<ref>Judd, p. 3; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8</ref> Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been "rather distressed". Two days later, he wrote again: "I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name ''Albert'' to her."<ref>Judd, pp. 4–5; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8</ref>

The Queen was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: "I am all impatience to see the ''new'' one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good."<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8</ref> Consequently, he was [[baptised]] "Albert Frederick Arthur George" at [[St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham]], three months later.{{efn|His godparents were: [[Queen Victoria]] (his great-grandmother, for whom his grandmother the [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Frederick William, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg|Grand Duke]] and [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge|Grand Duchess]] of Mecklenburg (his maternal great-aunt and great-uncle, for whom his grandfather the [[Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke of Teck]] and his paternal aunt [[Maud of Wales|Princess Maud of Wales]] stood proxy); [[Empress Frederick]] (his paternal great-aunt, for whom his paternal aunt [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]] (his great-uncle, for whom his grandfather the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]] (his great-uncle); the [[Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Duchess of Fife]] (his paternal aunt); and [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Prince Adolphus of Teck]] (his maternal uncle).<ref>''[[The Times]]'', Tuesday 18 February 1896, p. 11</ref>}} Within the family, he was known informally as "Bertie".<ref>Judd, p. 6; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Windsor, p. 9</ref> The Duchess of Teck did not like the first name her grandson had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name "may supplant the less favoured one".<ref>Bradford, p. 2</ref> Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]].

He often suffered from ill health and was described as "easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears".<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 17–18</ref> His parents were generally removed from their children's day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He had a [[stammer]] that lasted for many years. Although naturally [[left-handed]], he was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time.<ref>{{citation|first=Howard I. |last=Kushner |title=Retraining the King's left hand |journal=The Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9782 |year=2011 |pages=1998–1999 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60854-4|pmid=21671515 |s2cid=35750495 }}</ref> He suffered from chronic stomach problems as well as [[knock knees]], for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.<ref name="matthew">{{citation|first=H. C. G.|last=Matthew|author-link=Colin Matthew|title=George VI (1895–1952)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004}}</ref> Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. Prince Albert moved up to third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.

==Military career and education==
From 1909, Albert attended the [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]], as a naval [[cadet]]. In 1911 he came bottom of the class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]].<ref>Bradford, pp. 41–45; Judd, pp. 21–24; Rhodes James, p. 91</ref> When his grandfather, Edward VII, died in 1910, his father became King George V. Edward became Prince of Wales, with Albert second in line to the throne.<ref>Judd, pp. 22–23</ref>

Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship {{HMS|Cumberland|1902|6}} in the [[West Indies]] and on the east coast of Canada.<ref>Judd, p. 26</ref> He was rated as a [[midshipman]] aboard {{HMS|Collingwood|1908|6}} on 15 September 1913. He spent three months in the Mediterranean, but never overcame his seasickness.<ref>Judd, p. 186</ref> Three weeks after the outbreak of World War I he was medically evacuated from the ship to Aberdeen, where his appendix was removed by [[Sir John Marnoch]].<ref>{{citation|title=Royal Connections |url=http://www.med-chi.co.uk/heritage/history/the-archive/royal-connections.html#nav |website=Aberdeen Medico-Chirugical Society |access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref> He was [[mentioned in despatches]] for his actions as a turret officer aboard ''Collingwood'' in the [[Battle of Jutland]] (31 May – 1 June 1916), the great naval battle of the war. He did not see further combat, largely because of ill health caused by a [[duodenal ulcer]], for which he had an operation in November 1917.<ref name=Bradford55>Bradford, pp. 55–76</ref>
[[File:Prince Albert in RAF uniform.png|thumb|upright|Albert at an RAF dinner in 1919]]
In February 1918 he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the [[Royal Naval Air Service]]'s training establishment at [[RAF Cranwell|Cranwell]]. With the establishment of the [[Royal Air Force]] Albert transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force.<ref>Bradford, p. 72</ref> He served as Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918,<ref>Bradford, pp. 73–74</ref> before reporting to the RAF's Cadet School at [[St Leonards-on-Sea]]. He completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, p. 115</ref> He was the first member of the British royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot.<ref>Judd, p. 45; Rhodes James, p. 91</ref>

Albert wanted to serve on the Continent while the war was still in progress and welcomed a posting to [[General Trenchard]]'s staff in France. On 23 October, he flew across the Channel to [[Autigny, Seine-Maritime|Autigny]].<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, p. 116</ref> For the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's [[Independent Air Force]] at its headquarters in [[Nancy, France]].<ref>{{citation |last= Boyle |first= Andrew |author-link= Andrew Boyle |title= Trenchard Man of Vision |year= 1962 |publisher= Collins |location= St James's Place London |page= 360|chapter= Chapter 13}}</ref> Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as an RAF staff officer until posted back to Britain.<ref>Judd, p. 44</ref> He accompanied Belgian [[King Albert I]] on his triumphal re-entry into Brussels on 22 November. Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and was promoted to [[squadron leader]] the following day.<ref>{{citation|last= Heathcote |first= Tony |date= 2012 |title= The British Field Marshals: 1736–1997: A Biographical Dictionary |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KAkkUN7s4TIC&pg=PT226 |publisher= Casemate Publisher |isbn= 978-1783461417}}</ref>

In October 1919, Albert went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied history, economics and civics for a year,<ref>Judd, p. 47; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 128–131</ref> with the historian [[Reginald Vere Laurence|R. V. Laurence]] as his "official mentor".<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, p. 128</ref> On 4 June 1920 his father created him [[Duke of York]], [[Earl of Inverness]] and [[Baron Killarney]].<ref>Weir, p. 329</ref> He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father, and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the "Industrial Prince".<ref>''Current Biography 1942'', p. 280; Judd, p. 72; Townsend, p. 59</ref> His stammer, and his embarrassment over it, together with a tendency to shyness, caused him to appear less confident in public than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis. He played at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in the [[1926 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Doubles|Men's Doubles]] with [[Louis Greig]] in 1926, losing in the first round.<ref>Judd, p. 52</ref> He developed an interest in working conditions, and was president of the [[Industrial Welfare Society]]. His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds.<ref>Judd, pp. 77–86; Rhodes James, p. 97</ref>

==Marriage==

In a time when royalty were expected to marry fellow royalty, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite [[Sheila Chisholm|Lady Loughborough]] came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/457107/Sheila-The-Australian-Ingenue-Who-Bewitched-British-Society-review| last=Henderson| first=Gerard| title=Sheila: The Australian Ingenue Who Bewitched British Society – review| date=31 January 2014| newspaper=Daily Express| access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{citation| url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/02/28/sheila-who-captured-londons-heart| author=Australian Associated Press| title=A Sheila who captured London's heart| date=28 February 2014| publisher=Special Broadcasting Service| access-date=14 March 2015}}</ref> That year, he met for the first time since childhood [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the youngest daughter of the [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]. He became determined to marry her.<ref>Rhodes James, pp. 94–96; Vickers, pp. 31, 44</ref> She rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family.<ref>Bradford, p. 106</ref> In the words of her mother [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne]], Albert would be "made or marred" by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.<ref>Bradford, p. 77; Judd, pp. 57–59</ref>

They were married on 26 April 1923 in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Albert's marriage to someone not of royal birth was considered a modernising gesture.<ref>{{citation | last=Roberts |first=Andrew |editor=Antonia Fraser |title=The House of Windsor|publisher=Cassell & Co. |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-304-35406-1 |pages=57–58|editor-link=Antonia Fraser}}</ref> The newly formed [[British Broadcasting Company]] wished to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the Abbey [[Dean and Chapter of Westminster|Chapter]] vetoed the idea (although the [[Dean of Westminster|Dean]], [[Herbert Edward Ryle]], was in favour).<ref>{{citation |last=Reith |first=John |author-link=John Reith, 1st Baron Reith |title=Into the Wind |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London |year=1949 |page=94}}</ref>

From December 1924 to April 1925, the Duke and Duchess toured [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]], and the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], travelling via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Aden]]. During the trip, they both went [[big game hunting]].<ref>Judd, pp. 89–93</ref>

Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking.<ref>Judd, p. 49</ref> After his closing speech at the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley]] on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners,<ref>Judd, pp. 93–97; Rhodes James, p. 97</ref> he began to see [[Lionel Logue]], an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently.<ref>Judd, p. 98; Rhodes James, p. 98</ref> Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation.<ref>''Current Biography 1942'', pp. 294–295; Judd, p. 99</ref> With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]], Australia, during a tour of the empire with the Duchess in 1927.<ref>Judd, p. 106; Rhodes James, p. 99</ref> Their journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took them via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.<ref>Shawcross, p. 273</ref>

The Duke and Duchess had two children: [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] (called "Lilibet" by the family) who was born in 1926, and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] who was born in 1930. The close and loving family lived at 145 [[Piccadilly]], rather than one of the royal palaces.<ref>Judd, pp. 111, 225, 231</ref> In 1931, the [[Canadian prime minister]], [[R. B. Bennett]], considered the Duke for [[Governor General of Canada]]—a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]], [[J. H. Thomas]].<ref>Howarth, p. 53</ref>

==Reluctant king==
{{Main|Abdication of Edward VIII}}

King George V had severe reservations about Prince Edward, saying "After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in twelve months" and "I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne."<ref>Ziegler, p. 199</ref> On 20 January 1936, George V died and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. In the [[Vigil of the Princes]], Prince Albert and his three brothers (the new king, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], and [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]) took a shift standing guard over their father's body as it [[lay in state]], in a closed casket, in [[Westminster Hall]].

As Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry his mistress, [[Wallis Simpson]], who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by [[British prime minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. He abdicated and Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept.<ref>Judd, p. 140</ref> The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary. He wrote in his diary, "When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child."<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, p. 286</ref>

On the day of the abdication, the [[Oireachtas]], the parliament of the [[Irish Free State]], [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed all direct mention of the monarch]] from the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Irish constitution]]. The next day, it passed the [[External Relations Act]], which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.<ref>Townsend, p. 93</ref>

Across Britain gossip spread that Albert was physically and psychologically incapable of handling the kingship. He worried about that himself. No evidence has been found to support the rumour that the government considered bypassing him in favour of his scandal-ridden younger brother, George.<ref>Bradford, p. 208; Judd, pp. 141–142</ref>

==Early reign==
[[File:Darlington God save the king..JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three-storey Victorian building festooned with garlands with the words "God Save the King" mounted on the pitched roof|[[Darlington]] Town Hall decorated for the coronation, 1937]]

Albert assumed the [[regnal name]] "George VI" to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy.<ref>Howarth, p. 66; Judd, p. 141</ref> The beginning of George VI's reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as "His Royal Highness Prince Edward" for the abdication broadcast,<ref>Judd, p. 144; Sinclair, p. 224</ref> but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession, Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including "Royal Highness".<ref>Howarth, p. 143</ref> In settling the issue, George's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title "[[Duke of Windsor]]" with the style "Royal Highness", but the [[letters patent]] creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]], as these were private properties and did not pass to him automatically.<ref>Ziegler, p. 326</ref> Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new [[queen consort]], with the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>Bradford, p. 223</ref>

[[George VI's coronation]] at Westminster Abbey took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, his mother Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a show of support for her son.<ref>Bradford, p. 214</ref> There was no [[durbar (court)|Durbar]] held in [[Delhi]] for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the [[British Raj|Government of India]].<ref>Vickers, p. 175</ref> Rising [[Indian independence movement|Indian nationalism]] made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best,<ref>Bradford, p. 209</ref> and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.<ref>Bradford, pp. 269, 281</ref>

The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement of Hitler]].<ref name="matthew"/><ref>Sinclair, p. 230</ref> When the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]] with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family.<ref name="matthew" /> While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which led historian [[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]] to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as "the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century".<ref>[[Hitchens, Christopher]] (1 April 2002), [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/01/queenmother.monarchy9 "Mourning will be brief"], ''The Guardian'', retrieved 1 May 2009</ref>

The official royal tour historian, [[Gustave Lanctot]], wrote "the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality" and George gave a speech emphasising "the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth".<ref>{{citation| last=Galbraith| first=William| title=Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=12| issue=3| pages=7–9| year=1989| url=http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=820&param=130| access-date=24 March 2015}}</ref>

The trip was intended to soften the strong [[isolationist]] tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public.<ref>Judd, pp. 163–166; Rhodes James, pp. 154–168; Vickers, p. 187</ref> The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor was dispelled.<ref>Bradford, pp. 298–299</ref> They visited the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and stayed with President [[Franklin D.

A</ref> A strong bond of friendship was forged between the King and Queen and the President during the tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.<ref>{{citation |last=Swift |first=Will |title=The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2004}}</ref><ref>Judd, p. 189; Rhodes James, p. 344</ref>

In 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, though personally George would have preferred to appoint [[Lord Halifax]].<ref>Judd, p. 180</ref> After the King's initial dismay over Churchill's appointment of [[Lord Beaverbrook]] to the Cabinet, he and Churchill developed "the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister".<ref>Rhodes James, p. 195</ref> Every Tuesday for four and a half years from September 1940, the two men met privately for lunch to discuss the war in secret and with frankness.<ref>Rhodes James, pp. 202–210</ref> The King related much of what the two discussed in his diary, which is the only extant first-hand account of these conversations.<ref>Weisbrode, Kenneth (2013), ''Churchill and the King'', New York: Viking, pp. 107, 117–118, 148, 154–155, 166. {{ISBN|978-0670025763}}.</ref>

Throughout the war, the King and Queen provided morale-boosting visits throughout the United Kingdom, visiting bomb sites, munitions factories, and troops. The King visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939, North Africa and [[Malta]] in June 1943, [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]] in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944.<ref>Judd, pp. 176, 201–203, 207–208</ref> Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place as symbols of national resistance.<ref>Judd, p. 170</ref> At a social function in 1944, the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Alan Brooke]], revealed that every time he met Field Marshal Sir [[Bernard Montgomery]], he thought Montgomery was after his job. The King replied: "You should worry, when I meet him, I always think he's after mine!"<ref>{{citation|author=Reagan, Geoffrey|year=1992|title=Military Anecdotes|page=25|publisher=Guinness|isbn=978-0-85112-519-0}}</ref>

In 1945, crowds shouted "We want the King!" in front of Buckingham Palace during the [[Victory in Europe Day]] celebrations. In an echo of Chamberlain's appearance, the King invited Churchill to appear with the royal family on the balcony to public acclaim.<ref>Judd, p. 210</ref> In January 1946, George addressed the [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations]] at their first assembly, which was held in London, and reaffirmed "our faith in the equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small".<ref>Townsend, p. 173</ref>

==Empire to Commonwealth==
[[File:Attlee with GeorgeVI HU 59486.jpg|thumb|King George VI and British prime minister [[Clement Attlee]] (left) at Buckingham Palace, July 1945]]

George VI's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the [[British Empire]]. The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], gathered pace after the Second World War.<ref>Townsend, p. 176</ref> During the ministry of [[Clement Attlee]], [[British India]] became the two independent Dominions of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] in August 1947.<ref>Townsend, pp. 229–232, 247–265</ref> George relinquished the title of [[Emperor of India]], and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In January 1950, he ceased to be King of India when it became a full republic within the Commonwealth and recognised his new title of [[Head of the Commonwealth]]; he remained King of Pakistan until his death. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as [[Burma]] in January 1948, [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] (divided between [[Israel]] and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.<ref>Townsend, pp. 267–270</ref>

In 1947, the King and his family toured Southern Africa.<ref>Townsend, pp. 221–223</ref> The prime minister of the [[Union of South Africa]], [[Jan Smuts]], was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit.<ref>Judd, p. 223</ref> George was appalled, however, when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites,<ref>Rhodes James, p. 295</ref> and referred to his South African bodyguards as "the [[Gestapo]]".<ref>Rhodes James, p. 294; Shawcross, p. 618</ref> Despite the tour, Smuts lost [[1948 South African general election|the election the following year]], and the new government instituted a [[apartheid|strict policy of racial segregation]].

==Illness and death==
The stress of the war had taken its toll on the King's health,<ref>{{citation|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|title=King George VI|url=https://www.royal.uk/george-vi-r1936-1952|access-date=18 April 2016|date=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref>Judd, p. 225; Townsend, p. 174</ref> made worse by his heavy [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]<ref>Judd, p. 240</ref> and subsequent development of [[lung cancer]] among other ailments, including [[arteriosclerosis]] and [[Buerger's disease]]. A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after the King suffered an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right [[lumbar sympathectomy]] in March 1949.<ref>Rhodes James, pp. 314–317</ref> His elder daughter Elizabeth, the heir presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Elizabeth and her husband, [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], taking the place of the King and Queen.

The King was well enough to open the [[Festival of Britain]] in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, he underwent a surgical operation where his entire left [[pneumonectomy|lung was removed]] by [[Clement Price Thomas]] after a malignant tumour was found.<ref>Bradford, p. 454; Rhodes James, p. 330</ref> In October 1951, Elizabeth and Philip went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the [[State Opening of Parliament]] in November, the King's [[speech from the throne]] was read for him by the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Lord Simonds]].<ref>Rhodes James, p. 331</ref> His [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas broadcast]] of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.<ref>Rhodes James, p. 334</ref>

On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, the King went to [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]]{{efn|Renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/our-history|title=About Heathrow Airport: Heathrow's history|publisher=LHR Airports|access-date=9 March 2015}}</ref>}} to see Elizabeth and Philip off on their tour to Australia via [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]]. It was his last public appearance. Six days later, at 07:30 [[GMT]] on the morning of 6 February, he was found dead in bed at [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/6/newsid_2711000/2711265.stm|title=1952: King George VI dies in his sleep|publisher=BBC|access-date=29 May 2018|date=6 February 1952}}</ref> He had died in the night from a [[coronary thrombosis]] at age 56.<ref>Judd, pp. 247–248</ref> His daughter flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1802079.stm|title=The day the King died|publisher=BBC|date=6 February 2002|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref>

In the words of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[George Hardie (politician)|George Hardie]], the abdication crisis of 1936 did "more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda".<ref>Hardie in the British House of Commons, 11 December 1936, quoted in Rhodes James, p. 115</ref> George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed "a rocking throne" and tried "to make it steady again".<ref>Letter from George VI to the Duke of Windsor, quoted in Rhodes James, p. 127</ref> He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb. During his reign his people endured the hardships of war, and imperial power was eroded. However, as a dutiful family man and by showing personal courage, he succeeded in restoring the popularity of the monarchy.<ref>{{Citation|last=Ashley|first=Mike|author-link=Mike Ashley (writer)|year=1998|title=British Monarchs|publisher=Robinson|location=London|isbn=978-1-84119-096-9|pages=703–704}}</ref><ref>Judd, pp. 248–249</ref>

The [[George Cross]] and the [[George Medal]] were founded at the King's suggestion during the Second World War to recognise acts of exceptional civilian bravery.<ref>Judd, p. 186; Rhodes James, p. 216</ref> He bestowed the George Cross on the entire "[[Siege of Malta (World War II)|island fortress of Malta]]" in 1943.<ref>Townsend, p. 137</ref> He was posthumously awarded the [[Ordre de la Libération]] by the French government in 1960, one of only two people (the other being Churchill) to be awarded the medal after 1946.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_doc/liste_compagnons.pdf|publisher=Ordre de la Libération|access-date=19 September 2009|title=List of Companions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306131445/http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_doc/liste_compagnons.pdf|archive-date=6 March 2009}}</ref>
