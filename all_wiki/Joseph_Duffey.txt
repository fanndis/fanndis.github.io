'''Joseph Daniel Duffey''' (born July 1, 1932) is an [[United States|American]] academic, educator and political appointee.

==Early life and career==
Duffey was born in [[Huntington, West Virginia]]. He received an A.B. from [[Marshall University]] in 1954, a B.D. from [[Andover Newton Theological School|Andover Theological School]] in 1957, an S.T.M. from [[Yale University]] in 1963, and a Ph.D. from Hartford Seminary Foundation in 1969. From 1960 to 1970, Duffey was an assistant professor and then acting dean and associate professor, at [[Hartford Seminary]]. He was also founder and director of the Center for Urban Studies there. 

==1970 election==
Duffey ran for the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1970 as a prominent anti-Vietnam War candidate; he had just turned 35 years old. The campaign became notable because several of Duffey's young supporters went on to prominent careers in Democratic politics, including future president [[Bill Clinton]], a [[Yale Law School]] student at the time.<ref name=Spivack>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-01-18/news/0000107202_1_campaign-worker-senate-campaign-bill-clinton"Rekindling Memories Of Clinton, 1970 Senate Campaign"], ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'', January 18, 1993.</ref>

The [[incumbent]] in that race, [[Thomas J. Dodd]], was the father of future Connecticut Senator [[Christopher Dodd]]. Dodd, who had been censured by the Senate for corruption, was not re-nominated by the Democratic Party. Instead, Duffey joined Stamford businessman Alphonsus J. (Al) Donahue, State Senate President Edward Marcus, and former congressman [[Donald J. Irwin]]<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/27/archives/democrats-meet-in-connecticut-bayh-is-keynote-speaker-at-state.html</ref> in a race to win the party endorsement. Donahue won the Democratic convention, but Duffey went on to win the primary. He finished second in a three-way general election race to [[Lowell Weicker]], with Senator Dodd running as an independent. Some of these events were captured in a documentary, ''Dissent of the Governed''.<ref>https://archive.org/details/DissentOfTheGoverned_201410</ref>

Anne Wexler ran his 1970 campaign, and the two married in September 1974 after they had both divorced their respective spouses.<ref name=Wexler>Martin, Douglas.
