'''Japan''' ({{lang-ja|日本}}, ''Nippon'' {{IPA-ja|ɲippoꜜɴ||ja-nippon(日本).ogg}} or ''Nihon'' {{IPA-ja|ɲihoꜜɴ||ja-nihon(日本).ogg}}) is an [[island country]] in [[East Asia]] located in the northwest [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is bordered by the [[Sea of Japan]] to the west and extends from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the north to the [[East China Sea]] and [[Taiwan]] in the south. Part of the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]], Japan comprises [[Japanese archipelago|an archipelago]] of [[List of islands of Japan|6,852 islands]] covering {{convert|377,975|sqkm|sqmi|sp=us}}; the country's five main islands, from north to south, are [[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Shikoku]], [[Kyushu]], and [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]]. [[Tokyo]] is Japan's capital and largest city; other major cities include [[Yokohama]], [[Osaka]], [[Nagoya]], [[Sapporo]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Kobe]], and [[Kyoto]].

Japan is the [[List of countries by population|eleventh-most populous country]] in the world, as well as one of the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most densely populated]] and [[Urbanization by country|urbanized]]. About three-fourths of the [[Geography of Japan|country's terrain]] is mountainous, concentrating its population of 126.2 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into [[Prefectures of Japan|47 administrative prefectures]] and [[Regions of Japan|eight traditional regions]]. The [[Greater Tokyo Area]] is the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous metropolitan area]] in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.

Japan [[Japanese Paleolithic|has been inhabited]] since the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (30,000 BC), though the first mentions of the archipelago appear in [[Book of Han|Chinese chronicles]] from the 1st century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] and his [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial court]] based in [[Heian-kyō]]. Beginning in the 12th century, however, political power was held by a series of military dictators (''[[shōgun]]'') and feudal lords (''[[daimyō]]''), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (''[[samurai]]''). After a [[Sengoku period|century-long period of civil war]], the country was reunified in 1603 under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which enacted an [[Sakoku|isolationist foreign policy]]. In 1854, a [[Perry Expedition|United States fleet]] forced Japan to [[Bakumatsu|open trade to the West]], which led to [[Boshin War|the end of the shogunate]] and the [[Meiji Restoration|restoration of imperial power]] in 1868. In the [[Meiji period]], the [[Empire of Japan]] adopted a [[Meiji Constitution|Western-styled constitution]] and pursued a program of [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]]. In 1937, Japan [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invaded China]]; in 1941, it entered [[World War II]] as an [[Axis power]]. After suffering defeat in the [[Pacific War]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two atomic bombings]], Japan [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered]] in 1945 and came under a seven-year [[Occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]], during which it adopted a [[Constitution of Japan|new constitution]]. Since 1947, Japan has maintained a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature, the [[National Diet]].

Japan is a [[great power]] and a member of numerous international organizations, including the [[United Nations]] (since 1956), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], and the [[G7]]. Although it has [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|renounced its right to declare war]], the country maintains [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]] that are ranked as the world's [[Military#Capability development|fourth-most powerful military]]. After World War II, Japan experienced [[Japanese economic miracle|high economic growth]], becoming the [[List of countries by largest historical GDP|second-largest economy]] in the world by 1990 before being surpassed by China in 2010. Despite [[Economic stagnation|stagnant growth]] since the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]], the [[Economy of Japan|country's economy]] remains the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|third-largest by nominal GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth-largest by PPP]]. A leader in the [[Automotive industry in Japan|automotive]] and [[Electronics industry in Japan|electronics industries]], Japan has made significant contributions to [[Science and technology in Japan|science and technology]]. Ranked the [[List of countries in Asia and Oceania by Human Development Index|second-highest country]] on the [[Human Development Index]] in Asia after [[Singapore]], Japan has the world's [[List of countries by life expectancy|second-highest life expectancy]], though it is currently experiencing a [[Aging of Japan|decline in population]]. [[Japanese culture]] is well-known around the world, including its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]], [[Japanese music|music]], and [[Japanese popular culture|popular culture]], which encompasses prominent [[anime|animation]] and [[Video gaming in Japan|video game]] industries.
