'''Sexism''' is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] based on a person's [[Sex and gender distinction|sex or gender]]. Sexism can affect anyone, but it primarily affects [[Woman|women]] and [[Girl|girls]].<!--NOTE: Consensus among WP: Reliable sources, assessed via WP: Due weight, is that sexism is typically against women. Before removing this text, raise the issue on the talk page first.--><ref name="Sexism">There is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism refers primarily to discrimination against women, and primarily affects women. See, for example:

* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition |year=2015}} Defines sexism as "prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls".

It functions to maintain patriarchy, or male domination, through ideological and material practices of individuals, collectives, and institutions that oppress women and girls on the basis of sex or gender."

* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Collins Dictionary of Sociology |year=2006 |publisher=[[Harper Collins]]}} Defines sexism as "any devaluation or denigration of women or men, but particularly women, which is embodied in institutions and social relationships."
* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Palgrave MacMillan Dictionary of Political Thought |year=2007 |publisher=[[Palgrave MacMillan]]}} Notes that "either sex may be the object of sexist attitudes{{nbsp}}... however, it is commonly held that, in developed societies, women have been the usual victims".
* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Love, Courtship, and Sexuality through History, Volume 6: The Modern World |year=2007 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood]]}} "Sexism is any act, attitude, or institutional configuration that systematically subordinates or devalues women.

== Etymology and definitions ==

According to [[Fred R. Shapiro]], the term "sexism" was most likely coined on November 18, 1965, by Pauline M. Leet during a "Student-Faculty Forum" at [[Franklin and Marshall College]].<ref name="wordpress2007">{{cite web|url=http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/feminism-friday-the-origins-of-the-word-sexism/ |title=Feminism Friday: The origins of the word "sexism" |website=Finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com |date=October 19, 2007 |access-date=July 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=Daniel J.|title=The Wise Legacy: How One Professor Transformed the Nation|date=February 16, 2015|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=9781507625590|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjbGBgAAQBAJ|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=June 2020}} Specifically, the word sexism appears in Leet's forum contribution "Women and the Undergraduate", and she defines it by comparing it to racism, stating in part (on page&nbsp;3): "When you argue&nbsp;... that since fewer women write good poetry this justifies their total exclusion, you are taking a position analogous to that of the racist—I might call you in this case a 'sexist'&nbsp;... Both the racist and the sexist are acting as if all that has happened had never happened, and both of them are making decisions and coming to conclusions about someone's value by referring to factors which are in both cases irrelevant."<ref name="wordpress2007"/>

Also, according to Shapiro, the first time the term "sexism" appeared in print was in [[Caroline Bird (American author)|Caroline Bird]]'s speech "On Being Born Female", which was published on November 15, 1968, in ''Vital Speeches of the Day'' (p.&nbsp;6).<ref name="wordpress2007"/> In this speech she said in part: "There is recognition abroad that we are in many ways a sexist country. Sexism is judging people by their sex when sex doesn't matter. Sexism is intended to rhyme with racism."<ref name="wordpress2007"/>

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Kate Manne]] defines sexism as one branch of a [[patriarchy|patriarchal order]]. In her definition, sexism rationalizes and justifies patriarchal norms, in contrast with [[misogyny]], the branch which polices and enforces patriarchal norms. Manne says that sexism often attempts to make patriarchal social arrangements seem natural, good, or inevitable so that there appears to be no reason to resist them.<ref>{{cite book |last=Manne |first=Kate |author-link=Kate Manne |date=2019 |title=Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=78–79 |isbn=9780190604981}}</ref>

Sexism may have been the impetus that fueled the witch trials between the 15th and 18th centuries.<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 01.</ref> In [[early modern Europe]], and in the European colonies in North America, claims were made that [[witch]]es were a threat to [[Christendom]]. The misogyny of that period played a role in the persecution of these women.<ref>Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco: Pandora.</ref><ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 42–45.</ref>

In ''[[Malleus Malificarum]]'', the book which played a major role in the witch hunts and trials, the authors argue that women are more likely to practice witchcraft than men, and write that:

: All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman&nbsp;... What else is a woman but a foe to friendship, an inescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair colors!<ref>Kramer and Sprenger. Malleus Maleficarum.</ref>

Witchcraft remains illegal in several countries, including [[Saudi Arabia]], where it is [[punishable by death]]. In 2011, a woman was beheaded in that country for "witchcraft and sorcery".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/13/world/meast/saudi-arabia-beheading/ | work=[[CNN]].com | title=Saudi woman beheaded for 'witchcraft and sorcery' | date=December 14, 2011}}</ref> Murders of women after being accused of witchcraft remain common in some parts of the world; for example, in [[Tanzania]], about 500 elderly women are murdered each year following such accusations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=World Health Organization |title=World Report on Violence Chapter 5 – Abuse of the elderly |url=https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap5.pdf |access-date=June 20, 2020 |website=who.int}}</ref>

When women are targeted with accusations of witchcraft and subsequent violence, it is often the case that several forms of discrimination interact—for example, discrimination based on gender with discrimination based on [[caste]], as is the case in India and Nepal, where such crimes are relatively common.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Shrestha |first=Deepesh |date=February 15, 2010 |title=Witch-hunts of low-caste women in Nepal |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7241937/Witch-hunts-of-low-caste-women-in-Nepal.html |access-date=June 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Iaccino |first=Ludovica |date=July 22, 2014 |title=Witch Hunting in India: Poor, Low Caste and Widows Main Targets |work=International Business Times |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/witch-hunting-india-poor-low-caste-widows-main-targets-1457809 |access-date=June 20, 2020}}</ref>

Laws, regulations, and traditions related to marriage continue to discriminate against women in many parts of the world, and to contribute to the mistreatment of women, in particular in areas related to [[sexual violence]] and to self-determination regarding [[sexuality]], the violation of the latter now being acknowledged as a violation of [[women's rights]]. In 2012, [[Navi Pillay]], then [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]], stated that:

<blockquote>Women are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence. Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate, while infertile women are rejected by husbands, families and communities. In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception{{nbsp}}... Ensuring that women have full autonomy over their bodies is the first crucial step towards achieving substantive equality between women and men. Personal issues—such as when, how and with whom they choose to have sex, and when, how and with whom they choose to have children—are at the heart of living a life in dignity.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pillay |first=Navi |author-link=Navi Pillay |date=2012 |title=Valuing women as autonomous beings: Women's sexual reproductive health rights |website=United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner |access-date=April 18, 2015 |url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313210726/http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf |archive-date=March 13, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>

=== Suffrage and politics ===

[[File:Annie Kenney and Christabel Pankhurst.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Two woman carry a sign reading "Votes for Women". |[[Annie Kenney]] and [[Christabel Pankhurst]]]]

Gender has been used as a tool for discrimination against women in the political sphere. [[Women's suffrage]] was not achieved until 1893, when New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. Saudi Arabia is the most recent country, as of August 2015, to extend the right to vote to women in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline of Women's Suffrage Granted, by Country|url=https://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0931343.html|publisher=Infoplease|access-date=December 1, 2013}}</ref> Some Western countries allowed women the right to vote only relatively recently.

While almost every woman today has the right to vote, there is still progress to be made for women in politics. Studies have shown that in several democracies including Australia, Canada, and the United States, women are still represented using gender stereotypes in the press.<ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008">{{cite journal|last1=Kittilson|first1=Miki Caul|last2=Fridkin|first2=Kim|title=Gender, Candidate Portrayals and Election Campaigns: A Comparative Perspective|journal=[[Politics & Gender]]|volume=4|issue=3|year=2008|issn=1743-923X|doi=10.1017/S1743923X08000330}}</ref> Multiple authors have shown that gender differences in the media are less evident today than they used to be in the 1980s, but are still present. Certain issues (e.g., education) are likely to be linked with female candidates, while other issues (e.g., taxes) are likely to be linked with male candidates.<ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"/> In addition, there is more emphasis on female candidates' personal qualities, such as their appearance and their personality, as females are portrayed as emotional and dependent.<ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"/>

Sexism in politics can also be shown in the imbalance of lawmaking power between men and women. Lanyan Chen stated that men hold more political power than women, serving as the gatekeepers of policy making. It is possible that this leads to women's needs not being properly represented. In this sense, the inequality of lawmaking power also causes gender discrimination in politics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Lanyan|title=The Gendered Reality of Migrant Workers in Globalizing China|date=2009|publisher=The [[University of Ottawa]]|location=Ottawa|isbn=978-0-7766-0709-2|pages=186–207}}</ref> The ratio of women to men in legislatures is used as a measure of gender equality in the [[United Nations]] (UN) created [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] and its newer incarnation the [[Gender Inequality Index]].

==== Menus ====

Until the early 1980s, some high-end restaurants had two [[menu]]s: a regular menu with the prices listed for men and a second menu for women, which did not have the prices listed (it was called the "ladies' menu"), so that the female diner would not know the prices of the items.<ref name="Frost">{{cite web |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ladies-menus-no-prices-lawsuit |title=The Court Case That Killed the 'Ladies Menu' |last=Frost |first=Natasha |date= February 2, 2018 |website=www.atlasobscura.com |publisher=[[Atlas Obscura]]|access-date=February 23, 2019}}</ref> In 1980, Kathleen Bick took a male business partner out to dinner at L'Orangerie in West Hollywood. After she was given a women's menu without prices and her guest got one with prices, Bick hired lawyer [[Gloria Allred]] to file a discrimination lawsuit, on the grounds that the women's menu went against the California Civil Rights Act.<ref name="Frost"/> Bick stated that getting a women's menu without prices left her feeling "humiliated and incensed". The owners of the restaurant defended the practice, saying it was done as a courtesy, like the way men would stand up when a woman enters the room. Even though the lawsuit was dropped, the restaurant ended its gender-based menu policy.<ref name="Frost"/>

Thoman and others (2008) hypothesize that "[t]he socio-cultural salience of ability versus other components of the gender-math stereotype may impact women pursuing math". Through the experiment comparing the math outcomes of women under two various gender-math stereotype components, which are the ability of math and the effort on math respectively, Thoman and others found that women's math performance is more likely to be affected by the negative ability stereotype, which is influenced by sociocultural beliefs in the United States, rather than the effort component. As a result of this experiment and the sociocultural beliefs in the United States, Thoman and others concluded that individuals' academic outcomes can be affected by the gender-math stereotype component that is influenced by the sociocultural beliefs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Thoman | first1=Dustin B. | last2=White | first2=Paul H. | last3=Yamawaki | first3=Niwako | last4=Koishi | first4=Hirofumi | year=2008 | title=Variations of Gender–math Stereotype Content Affect Women's Vulnerability to Stereotype Threat | journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume=58 | issue=9–10| pages=702–12 | doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9390-x| s2cid=144788626 }}</ref>

"Gender and Spoken Interaction: A Survey of Feminist Theories and Sociolinguistic Research in the United States and Britain." {{cite web|url=http://paul-server.hum.aau.dk/research/cv/Pubs/mille-mcilvenny.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309145105/https://paul-server.hum.aau.dk/research/cv/Pubs/mille-mcilvenny.pdf |archive-date=March 9, 2005 }}</ref> Most of these theories have maintained a critical stance on language that calls for a change in the way speakers use their language.

One of the most common calls is for gender-neutral language. Many have called attention, however, to the fact that the English language is not inherently sexist in its linguistic system, but the way it is used becomes sexist and gender-neutral language could thus be employed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam034/90034404.pdf|title=Feminist literary studies: an introduction|website=catdir.loc.gov|access-date=November 18, 2019}}</ref> Other opposed critiques of sexism in language maintain that language is descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and attempts to control it can be fruitless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/language.htm |title=Against the Theory of "Sexist Language" |publisher=Friesian.com |date=March 9, 2012 |access-date=March 31, 2015}}</ref>

=== Sexism in languages other than English ===

[[Romanic languages]] such as [[French language|French]]<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/world/europe/france-drops-mademoiselle-from-official-use.html|title=France Drops 'Mademoiselle' From Official Use|last=Sayare|first=Scott|date=February 22, 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 26, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]<ref name="auto1">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12843948 |title=Mexico advises workers on sexist language—BBC News |publisher=bbc.co.uk|access-date=March 31, 2015|work=BBC News |date=March 23, 2011 }}</ref> may be seen as reinforcing sexism, in that the masculine form is the default.

[[German language|German]] speakers have also raised questions about how sexism intersects with grammar.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nandi |first=Jacinta |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/03/05/grappling-with-language-sexism/ |title=Grappling with language sexism |publisher=blogs.reuters.com |date= March 5, 2011 |access-date=March 31, 2015}}</ref> The German language is heavily inflected for gender, number, and case; nearly all nouns denoting the occupations or statuses of human beings are gender-differentiated. For more gender-neutral constructions, gerund nouns are sometimes used instead, as this eliminates the grammatical gender distinction in the plural, and significantly reduces it in the singular. For example, instead of ''die Studenten'' ("the men students") or ''die Studentinnen'' ("the women students"), one writes ''die Studierenden'' ("the [people who are] studying").<ref>{{cite news|last=Osel|first=Johann|date=February 18, 2015|title=Gleichberechtigung im Studium: Studenten, äh, Studierende|language=de|newspaper=Sueddeutsche.de|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bildung/gleichberechtigung-im-studium-studenten-aeh-aeh-studierende-1.2355340}}</ref> However, this approach introduces an element of ambiguity, because gerund nouns more precisely denote one currently engaged in the activity, rather than one who routinely engages in it as their primary occupation.<ref>Osel, ibid.</ref>

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], some writers have pointed to sexism inherent in the structure of written characters. For example, the character for man is linked to those for positive qualities like courage and effect while the character for wife is composed of a female part and a broom, considered of low worth.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=4316075|title=Sexism in the Chinese Language|first=Dali|last=Tan|date=1 January 1990|journal=[[NWSA Journal]]|volume=2|issue=4|pages=635–639}}</ref>

=== Gender-specific pejorative terms ===

Gender-specific pejorative terms intimidate or harm another person because of their gender. Sexism can be expressed in language with negative gender-oriented implications,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/media/7480/sst-guidance-quick-guide.pdf|title=Guidance for schools on preventing and responding to sexist, sexual and transphobic bullying : quick guide|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=Great Britain Department for Children, Schools and Families|oclc=663427461|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716122907/http://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/media/7480/sst-guidance-quick-guide.pdf|archive-date=July 16, 2014}}</ref> such as [[Disdain|condescension]].

Occupational sexism refers to [[discrimination|discriminatory]] practices, statements or actions, based on a person's [[sex]], occurring in the workplace. One form of occupational sexism is [[wage discrimination]]. In 2008, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) found that while female employment rates have expanded and gender employment and wage gaps have narrowed nearly everywhere, on average women still have 20% less chance to have a job and are paid 17% less than men.<ref name="oecd1"/> The report stated: <blockquote>[In] many countries, labour market discrimination—i.e. the unequal treatment of equally productive individuals only because they belong to a specific group—is still a crucial factor inflating disparities in employment and the quality of job opportunities [...] Evidence presented in this edition of the ''Employment Outlook'' suggests that about 8{{nbsp}}percent of the variation in gender employment gaps and 30 percent of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the labor market.<ref name="oecd1">[[OECD]].

=== Gap in hiring ===

Research has repeatedly shown that mothers in the United States are less likely to be hired than equally qualified fathers and if hired, receive a lower salary than male applicants with children.<ref name="Folbre" /><ref name="Goodman" /><ref name="Cahn" /><ref name="Young" /><ref name="Correll" /><ref name="Cornell" />

One study found that female applicants were favored; however, its results have been met with skepticism from other researchers, since it contradicts most other studies on the issue. Joan C. Williams, a distinguished professor at the University of California's Hastings College of Law, raised issues with its methodology, pointing out that the fictional female candidates it used were unusually well-qualified. Studies using more moderately qualified graduate students have found that male students are much more likely to be hired, offered better salaries, and offered mentorship.<ref>{{cite journal |title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|author=Wendy M.

=== Earnings gap ===

{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
[[File: EU 27 Gender Pay Gap 2014.png|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=Bar graph showing the gender pay gap in European countries|Gender pay gap in average gross hourly earnings according to [[Eurostat]] 2014<ref name="EC stats" />]]

Studies have concluded that on average women earn lower wages than men worldwide. Some people argue that this results from of widespread gender discrimination in the workplace. Others argue that the wage gap results from different choices by men and women, such as women placing more value than men on having children, and men being more likely than women to choose careers in high paying fields such as business, engineering, and technology.

[[Eurostat]] found a persistent, average gender pay gap of 27.5% in the 27 [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] in 2008.<ref name="EC stats">[[European Commission]]. [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/situation-europe/index_en.htm ''The situation in the EU''.] Retrieved on August 19, 2011.</ref> Similarly, the OECD found that female full-time employees earned 27% less than their male counterparts in OECD countries in 2009.<ref name="oecd1"/><ref name="oecd2"/>

In the United States, the female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.77 in 2009; female full-time, year-round (FTYR) workers earned 77% as much as male FTYR workers. Women's earnings relative to men's fell from 1960 to 1980 (56.7–54.2%), rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (54.2–67.6%), leveled off from 1990 to 2000 (67.6–71.2%) and rose from 2000 to 2009 (71.2–77.0%).<ref name="census 2009">U.S. Census Bureau.

Research conducted in the Czech and Slovak Republics shows that, even after the governments passed anti-discrimination legislation, two thirds of the gender gap in wages remained unexplained and segregation continued to "represent a major source of the gap".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Štěpán |last=Jurajda |year=2005 |title=Gender Segregation and Wage Gap: An East-West Comparison |journal=[[Journal of the European Economic Association]] |volume=3 |issue=2–3 |pages=598–607 |doi=10.1162/jeea.2005.3.2-3.598 |s2cid=54763679 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d81f696cbc2021e5bc7725325b8d57a83671d1c1 }}</ref>

The gender gap can also vary across-occupation and within occupation. In Taiwan, for example, studies show how the bulk of gender wage discrepancies occur within-occupation.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Joseph E., Jr. |last1=Zveglich |first2=Yana van der Meulen |last2=Rodgers |title=Occupational Segregation and the Gender Wage Gap in a Dynamic East Asian Economy |journal=[[Southern Economic Journal]] |volume=70 |issue=4 |year=2004 |pages=850–875 |doi=10.2307/4135276 |jstor=4135276 }}</ref> In Russia, research shows that the gender wage gap is distributed unevenly across income levels, and that it mainly occurs at the lower end of income distribution.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |first1=Christopher J. |last1=Gerry |first2=Byung-Yeon |last2=Kim |first3=Carmen A. |last3=Li |title=The Gender Wage Gap and Wage Arrears in Russia: Evidence from the RLMS |journal=[[Journal of Population Economics]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=267–288 |doi=10.1007/s00148-003-0160-3 |s2cid=7435706 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/17553/1/17553.pdf }}</ref> The research also found that "wage arrears and payment in-kind attenuated wage discrimination, particularly amongst the lowest paid workers, suggesting that Russian enterprise managers assigned lowest importance to equity considerations when allocating these forms of payment".<ref name=":1" />

The gender pay gap has been attributed to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between men and women (such as education, hours worked and occupation), innate behavioral and biological differences between men and women and discrimination in the labor market (such as gender stereotypes and customer and employer bias). Women take significantly more time off to raise children than men.<ref>The Open University: Learning Space.[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON303-8.2.1.pdf "Economics Explains Discrimination in the Labour Market."] Accessed June 29, 2012</ref> In certain countries such as South Korea, it has also been a long-established practice to lay-off female employees upon marriage.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Gyeongjoon |last=Yoo |year=2003 |title=Quality of Life Across Population Groups: Women in the Workplace: Gender and Wage Differentials |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=62 |issue=1–3 |pages=367–385 |doi=10.1023/A:1022661604653 |s2cid=153671276 }}</ref> A study by Professor [[Linda C.

Wage discrimination is theorized as contradicting the economic concept of [[supply and demand]], which states that if a good or service (in this case, labor) is in demand and has value it will find its price in the market. If a worker offered equal value for less pay, supply and demand would indicate a greater demand for lower-paid workers. If a business hired lower-wage workers for the same work, it would lower its costs and enjoy a [[competitive advantage]]. According to supply and demand, if women offered equal value demand (and wages) should rise since they offer a better price (lower wages) for their service than men do.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swifteconomics.com/2009/09/21/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-the-wage-gap/ |title=Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics: The Wage Gap |publisher=Swift Economics |date=September 21, 2009 |access-date=July 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705013033/http://www.swifteconomics.com/2009/09/21/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-the-wage-gap |archive-date=July 5, 2013 }}</ref>

There is research to suggest that the gender wage gap leads to big losses for the economy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Output Cost of Gender Discrimination: A Model-based Macroeconomics Estimate |journal=The Economic Journal|date=February 1, 2016|issn=1468-0297|pages=109–134|volume=126|issue=590|doi=10.1111/ecoj.12303|language=en|first1=Tiago|last1=Cavalcanti|first2=José|last2=Tavares|s2cid=15210316|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/267278}}</ref>

==== {{anchor|Proposed Explanations}} Causes for wage discrimination ====

According to Denise Venable at the [[National Center for Policy Analysis]], the "wage gap" in the United States is not the result of discrimination but of differences in lifestyle choices. Venable's report found that women are less likely than men to sacrifice personal happiness for increases in income or to choose full-time work. She found that among American adults working between one and thirty-five hours a week, and part-time workers who have never been married, women earn more than men. Venable also found that among people aged 27 to 33 who have never had a child, women's earnings approach 98% of men's and "women who hold positions and have skills and experience similar to those of men face wage disparities of less than 10 percent, and many are within a couple of points".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba392 |title=The Wage Gap Myth |publisher=NCPA |access-date=July 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830055457/http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba392/ |archive-date=August 30, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Venable concluded that women and men with equal skills and opportunities in the same positions face little or no wage discrimination: "Claims of unequal pay almost always involve comparing apples and oranges".

There is considerable agreement that gender wage discrimination exists, however, when estimating its magnitude, significant discrepancies are visible. A meta-regression analysis concludes that "the estimated gender gap has been steadily declining" and that the wage rate calculation is proven to be crucial in estimating the wage gap.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=T. D. |last1=Stanley |first2=Stephen B. |last2=Jarrell |title=Gender Wage Discrimination Bias?

=== Glass ceiling effect ===

{{Main|Glass ceiling}}

"The popular notion of glass ceiling effects implies that gender (or other) disadvantages are stronger at the top of the hierarchy than at lower levels and that these disadvantages become worse later in a person's career."<ref>{{cite journal |first1=David A. |last1=Cotter |first2=Joan M. |last2=Hermsen |first3=Seth |last3=Ovadia |first4=Reeve |last4=Vanneman |year=2001 |title=The Glass Ceiling Effect |journal=[[Social Forces]] |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=655–681 |doi=10.1353/sof.2001.0091 |s2cid=145245044 }}</ref>

In the United States, women account for 52% of the overall labor force, but make up only three percent of corporate CEOs and top executives.<ref name="David A 2011">{{cite journal |first1=David A. |last1=Matsa |first2=Amalia R. |last2=Miller |year=2011 |title=Chipping away at the Glass Ceiling: Gender Spillovers in Corporate Leadership |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |series=Papers and Proceedings |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=635–639 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.635 |s2cid=154536609 |url=http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/working_papers/2011/RAND_WR842.pdf }}</ref> Some researchers see the root cause of this situation in the tacit discrimination based on gender, conducted by current top executives and corporate directors (primarily male), and "the historic absence of women in top positions", which "may lead to [[hysteresis]], preventing women from accessing powerful, male-dominated professional networks, or same-sex mentors".<ref name="David A 2011" /> The glass ceiling effect is noted as being especially persistent for women of color. According to a report, "women of colour perceive a 'concrete ceiling' and not simply a glass ceiling".<ref name="David A 2011" />

In the economics profession, it has been observed that women are more inclined than men to dedicate their time to teaching and service. Since continuous research work is crucial for promotion, "the cumulative effect of small, contemporaneous differences in research orientation could generate the observed significant gender difference in promotion".<ref>{{cite journal |first1=John M. |last1=McDowell |first2=Larry D., Jr. |last2=Singell |first3=James P. |last3=Ziliak |year=1999 |title=Cracks in the Glass Ceiling: Gender and Promotion in the Economics Profession |journal=American Economic Review |volume=89 |issue=2 |series=Papers and Proceedings |pages=392–396 |jstor=117142 |doi=10.1257/aer.89.2.392 }}</ref> In the high-tech industry, research shows that, regardless of the intra-firm changes, "extra-organizational pressures will likely contribute to continued gender stratification as firms upgrade, leading to the potential masculinization of skilled high-tech work".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Steven C. |last=McKay |year=2006 |title=Hard Drives and Glass Ceilings: Gender Stratification in High-Tech Production |journal=[[Gender and Society]] |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=207–235 |doi=10.1177/0891243205285371 |s2cid=154793796 }}</ref>

==== Potential remedies ====

Research by David Matsa and Amalia Miller suggests that a remedy to the glass ceiling could be increasing the number of women on corporate boards, which could lead to increases in the number of women working in top management positions.<ref name="David A 2011"/> The same research suggests that this could also result in a "feedback cycle in which the presence of more female managers increases the qualified pool of potential female board members (for the companies they manage, as well as other companies), leading to greater female board membership and then further increases in female executives".<ref name="UN-IWD2006" />

=== Weight-based sexism ===

A 2009 study found that being overweight harms women's career advancement, but presents no barrier for men. [[Overweight]] women were significantly underrepresented among company bosses, making up between five and 22% of female CEOs. However, the proportion of overweight male CEOs was between 45% and 61%, over-representing overweight men. On the other hand, approximately five percent of CEOs were obese among both genders. The author of the study stated that the results suggest that "the '[[glass ceiling]] effect' on women's advancement may reflect not only general negative stereotypes about the competencies of women but also weight bias that results in the application of stricter appearance standards to women."<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1108/02610150910937916 | volume=28 | title=Weight discrimination and the glass ceiling effect among top US CEOs | year=2009 | journal=[[Equal Opportunities International]] | pages=179–196 | last1 = Roehling | first1 = Patricia V.| issue=2 }}.</ref><ref>Moult, Julie.

In August 1995, Kimberly Nixon filed a complaint with the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] against Vancouver Rape Relief & Women's Shelter. Nixon, a [[trans woman]], had been interested in volunteering as a counsellor with the shelter. When the shelter learned that she was [[transsexual]], they told Nixon that she would not be allowed to volunteer with the organization. Nixon argued that this constituted illegal discrimination under Section 41 of the British Columbia ''[[Human Rights Code (British Columbia)|Human Rights Code]]''. Vancouver Rape Relief countered that individuals are shaped by the [[socialization]] and experiences of their formative years, and that Nixon had been socialized as a male growing up, and that, therefore, Nixon would not be able to provide sufficiently effective counselling to the female born women that the shelter served. Nixon took her case to the Supreme Court of Canada, which refused to hear the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2007/02/03/Nixon/|title=Transsexual Loses Fight with Women's Shelter {{!}} The Tyee|last=Rupp|first=Shannon|date=2007-02-03|website=[[The Tyee]]|language=en|access-date=June 17, 2016}}</ref>

== Objectification ==

[[File:Menu.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Illustration of a woman splayed across a wine menu |Example of [[sexual objectification]] of women on a wine menu]]

In [[social philosophy]], [[objectification]] is the act of treating a person as an object or thing.

While advertising used to portray women and men in obviously stereotypical roles (e.g., as a housewife, breadwinner), in modern advertisements, they are no longer solely confined to their traditional roles. However, advertising today still stereotypes men and women, albeit in more subtle ways, including by sexually objectifying them.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Zimmerman | first1=Amanda | last2=Dahlberg | first2=John | year=2008 | title=The sexual objectification of women in advertising: A contemporary cultural perspective | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4682b9942712c00d48f819e9039023c9bae4ede6| journal=[[Journal of Advertising Research]] | volume=48 | issue=1| pages=71–79 | doi=10.2501/s0021849908080094| s2cid=30977582 }}</ref> Women are most often targets of sexism in advertising.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed|date=April 2018}} When in advertisements with men they are often shorter and put in the background of images, shown in more "feminine" poses, and generally present a higher degree of "body display".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zotos|first1=Yorgos|last2=Tsichla|first2=Eirini|date=October 2014|title=Snapshots of Men and Women in Interaction: An Investigation of Stereotypes in Print Advertisement Relationship Portrayals|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267842958|journal=Journal of Euromarketing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=35–58|via=ResearchGate|doi=10.9768/0023.03.035}}</ref>

Anti-pornography feminist [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that [[pornography]] contributes to sexism by objectifying women and portraying them in submissive roles.<ref>MacKinnon, Catharine (1987).

MacKinnon writes:
<blockquote>Pornography affects people's belief in rape myths. So for example if a woman says "I didn't consent" and people have been viewing pornography, they believe rape myths and believe the woman did consent no matter what she said. That when she said no, she meant yes. When she said she didn't want to, that meant more beer. When she said she would prefer to go home, that means she's a lesbian who needs to be given a good corrective experience. Pornography promotes these rape myths and desensitizes people to violence against women so that you need more violence to become sexually aroused if you're a pornography consumer. This is very well documented.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon | date=April 12, 2006}}</ref>}}</blockquote>

Women in any of these categories were seen at law as 'commonly available' to men, as always consenting to sexual activity and thus, as not able to be raped. Men accused of sexual assault were therefore able to use evidence of prostitution to defend themselves, to undermine the credibility of rape complainants and to successfully avoid conviction. | doi=10.1375/acri.40.2.127| s2cid=145263451 }}</ref> As a result, sex workers face higher [[violence against prostitutes|rates of violence]] and sexual assault.

=== Sexist jokes ===

[[Frederick T. Attenborough|Frederick Attenborough]] argues that sexist jokes can be a form of sexual objectification, which reduce the butt of the joke to an object.

== Gender identity discrimination ==

Gender discrimination is discrimination based on actual or perceived [[gender identity]].<ref name="fas.org"/> Gender identity is "the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual's designated sex at birth".<ref name="fas.org">{{cite web|author1=Feder, Jody |author2=Cynthia Brougher |name-list-style=amp |title=Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Discrimination in Employment: A Legal Analysis of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) |date=July 15, 2013 |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40934.pdf |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |access-date=March 31, 2015}}</ref> Gender discrimination is theoretically different from sexism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kimmel |first=Michael S. |year=2004 |title=The Gendered Society |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-514975-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/genderedsociety00kimm_0 }}</ref> Whereas sexism is prejudice based on biological sex, gender discrimination specifically addresses discrimination towards gender identities, including [[third gender]], [[genderqueer]], and other [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] identified people.<ref name="Macklem"/> It is especially attributed to how people are treated in the workplace,<ref name="Lenhart"/> and banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression has emerged as a subject of contention in the American legal system.<ref name="hrc.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/employment-non-discrimination-act |title=Employment Non-Discrimination Act &#124; Resources &#124; Human Rights Campaign |publisher=Hrc.org |date=March 9, 2015 |access-date=March 31, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520071809/http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/employment-non-discrimination-act |archive-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>

According to a recent report by the [[Congressional Research Service]], "although the majority of federal courts to consider the issue have concluded that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not sex discrimination, there have been several courts that have reached the opposite conclusion".<ref name="fas.org"/> Hurst states that "[c]ourts often confuse sex, gender and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hurst |first=C. |title=Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences |edition=Sixth |location=Boston |publisher=[[Allyn and Bacon|Pearson/Allyn and Bacon]] |year=2007 |pages=131, 139–142 |isbn=978-0-205-48436-2 }}</ref>

=== Oppositional sexism ===

Oppositional sexism is a term coined by [[Transfeminism|transfeminist]] author [[Julia Serano]], who defined oppositional sexism as "the belief that male and female are rigid, mutually exclusive categories".<ref name=":439">{{Cite book|title=Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|last=Serano|first=Julia|author-link=Julia Serano|publisher=[[Seal Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-786-74791-7|location=Emeryville, CA}}</ref> Oppositional sexism plays a vital role in a number of [[social norm]]s, such as [[cissexism]], [[heteronormativity]], and traditional sexism.

Oppositional sexism normalizes masculine expression in males and feminine expression in females while simultaneously demonizing femininity in males and masculinity in females. This concept plays a crucial role in supporting cissexism, the social norm that views cisgender people as both natural and privileged as opposed to transgender people.<ref name=":889">{{Cite book|title=Counseling Across Cultures|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2015|isbn=9781452217529|location=United States of America|edition=7th|editor-first2=Walter|editor-last=Pedersen|editor-first=Paul|editor-last2=Lonner|editor-last3=Draguns|editor-first3=Juris|editor-last4=Trimble|editor-first4=Joseph|editor-last5=Scharrón-del Río|editor-first5=María}}</ref>

The idea of having two, opposite genders is tied to sexuality through what [[Gender studies|gender theorist]] [[Judith Butler]] calls a "compulsory practice of heterosexuality".<ref name=":889" /> Because oppositional sexism is tied to heteronormativity in this way, non-heterosexuals are seen as breaking gender norms.<ref name=":889" />

The concept of opposite genders sets a "dangerous precedent", according to Serano, where "if men are big then women must be small; and if men are strong then women must be weak".<ref name=":439" /> The [[gender binary]] and oppositional norms work together to support "traditional sexism", the belief that femininity is inferior to and serves masculinity.<ref name=":889" />

Serano states that oppositional sexism works in tandem with "traditional sexism". This ensures that "those who are masculine have power over those who are feminine, and that only those that are born male will be seen as authentically masculine."<ref name=":439" />

=== Transgender discrimination ===

{{See also|Transphobia|Healthcare and the LGBT community}}

Transgender discrimination is discrimination towards peoples whose gender identity differs from the social expectations of the biological sex they were born with.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://campusclimate.berkeley.edu/students/ejce/geneq|title=GenEq {{!}} Campus Climate, Community Engagement & Transformation|website=campusclimate.berkeley.edu|access-date=August 26, 2019}}</ref> Forms of discrimination include but are not limited to identity documents not reflecting one's gender, sex-segregated public restrooms and other facilities, dress codes according to binary gender codes, and lack of access to and existence of appropriate health care services.<ref name="verdict.justia.com">{{Cite web|url=https://verdict.justia.com/2012/05/01/the-eeoc-rules-that-transgender-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination|title=The EEOC Rules That Transgender Discrimination Is Sex Discrimination: The Reasoning Behind That Decision|last=Grossman|first=Joanna L.|website=verdict.justia.com|language=en|access-date=August 26, 2019}}</ref> In a recent adjudication, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) concluded that discrimination against a transgender person is sex discrimination.<ref name="verdict.justia.com"/>

The 2008–09 National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS)—a U.S. study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in collaboration with the National Black Justice Coalition that was, at its time, the most extensive survey of transgender discrimination—showed that Black [[transgender people in the United States]] suffer "the combination of anti-transgender bias and persistent, structural and individual racism" and that "black transgender people live in extreme poverty that is more than twice the rate for transgender people of all races (15%), four times the general Black population rate (9%) and over eight times the general US population rate (4%)".<ref>{{cite web|title=Injustice at every turn: A look at Black respondents in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://nbjc.org/sites/default/files/trans-adjustment-web.pdf|website=[[National Black Justice Coalition]]|access-date=20 January 2018}}</ref> Further discrimination is faced by gender nonconforming individuals, whether transitioning or not, because of displacement from societally acceptable gender binaries and visible stigmatization. According to the NTDS, transgender gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face between eight percent and 15% higher rates of self and social discrimination and violence than binary transgender individuals. Lisa R. Miller and Eric Anthony Grollman found in their 2015 study that "gender nonconformity may heighten trans people's exposure to discrimination and health-harming behaviors. Gender nonconforming trans adults reported more events of major and everyday transphobic discrimination than their gender conforming counterparts."<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Miller | first1=Lisa R. | last2=Grollman | first2=Eric Anthony | year=2015 | title=The Social Costs of Gender Nonconformity for Transgender Adults: Implications for Discrimination and Health | journal=[[Sociological Forum]] | volume=30 | issue=3| pages=809–831 | doi=10.1111/socf.12193| pmid=27708501 | pmc=5044929}}</ref>

According to a report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women:
<blockquote>The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in [[Brazil]], and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of Argentina, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Peru, Syria, Venezuela, and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].<ref name="unhchr">''Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour: Report of the Secretary-General''.

The criminalization of marital rape is very recent, having occurred during the past few decades; in many countries it is still legal.

The criminal justice system in many [[common law countries]] has also been accused of discriminating against women. [[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]] is, in many common law countries, a partial defense to [[murder]], which converts what would have been murder into [[manslaughter]]. It is meant to be applied when a person kills in the "heat of passion" upon being "provoked" by the behavior of the victim. This defense has been criticized as being gendered, favoring men, because of it being used disproportionately in cases of [[adultery]], and other domestic disputes when women are killed by their partners. As a result of the defense exhibiting a strong gender bias, and being a form of legitimization of male violence against women and minimization of the harm caused by violence against women, it has been abolished or restricted in several jurisdictions.<ref>[http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/F2BA1BFEED2D87EECA257A4800001BD7/$File/briefing%20paper.provocation%20and%20self-defence.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623052433/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/F2BA1BFEED2D87EECA257A4800001BD7/%24File/briefing%20paper.provocation%20and%20self-defence.pdf|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Kate Fitz-Gibbon |title=Provocation in New South Wales: The need for abolition |journal=Australian & New Zealand Journal of Criminology |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=194–213 |date=August 1, 2012 |doi=10.1177/0004865812443681 |s2cid=144833987 }}</ref>

Women are more likely to avoid charges entirely, and to avoid imprisonment if convicted.<ref name="huffingtonpost.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/men-women-prison-sentence-length-gender-gap_n_1874742.html |title=Men Sentenced To Longer Prison Terms Than Women For Same Crimes, Study Says |work=Huffington Post |access-date=July 20, 2013 |first=Simon |last=McCormack |date=September 11, 2012}}</ref><ref name="University of Michigan">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx|title=Study finds large gender disparities in federal criminal cases|publisher=Law.umich.edu|access-date=August 30, 2013}}</ref> The gender disparity varies according to the nature of the case.

There have been several reasons postulated for the gender criminal justice disparity in the United States. One of the most common is the expectation that women are predominantly care-givers.<ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/><ref name="University of Michigan"/><ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"/> Other possible reasons include the "girlfriend theory" (whereby women are seen as tools of their boyfriends),<ref name="University of Michigan"/> the theory that female defendants are more likely to cooperate with authorities,<ref name="University of Michigan"/> and that women are often successful at turning their violent crime into victimhood by citing defenses such as [[postpartum depression]] or [[battered wife syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Patricia|title=When She Was Bad: How and Why Women Get Away With Murder|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0140243888|pages=[https://archive.org/details/whenshewasbadhow00pear/page/236 236–239]|url=https://archive.org/details/whenshewasbadhow00pear/page/236}}</ref> However, none of these theories account for the total disparity,<ref name="University of Michigan"/> and sexism has also been suggested as an underlying cause.<ref>"Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, however, the evidence is more consistent that part of this gap is due to different treatment of offenders based on their gender."{{cite web|url=http://www.ussc.gov/Research_and_Statistics/Research_Projects/Miscellaneous/15_Year_Study/chap4.pdf|title=Chapter Four: Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities In Federal Sentencing Today|publisher=Ussc.gov|access-date=August 30, 2013}}</ref>

Gender discrimination also helps explain the differences between trial outcomes in which some female defendants are sentenced to death and other female defendants are sentenced to lesser punishments. [[Phillip Barron]] argues that female defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death for crimes that violate gender norms, such as killing children or killing strangers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barron|first1=Phillip|title=Gender Discrimination in the U.S. Death Penalty System|journal=[[Radical Philosophy Review]]|date=2000|volume=3|issue=1|pages=89–96|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BARGDI|doi=10.5840/radphilrev20003110}}</ref>

Transgender people face widespread discrimination while incarcerated. They are generally housed according to their legal birth sex, rather than their gender identity. Studies have shown that transgender people are at an increased risk for harassment and sexual assault in this environment. They may also be denied access to medical procedures related to their reassignment.<ref>"Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, however, the evidence is more consistent that part of this gap is due to different treatment of offenders based on their gender."{{cite web|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/real-life-sophia-bursets-transgender-women-face-a-nightmare-in-mens-prisons-186876/|title=Real life Sophia Bursets Transgender Women face a nightmare in Men's Prisons|access-date=October 18, 2013|date=July 25, 2013}}</ref>

Some countries use [[stoning]] as a form of capital punishment. According to Amnesty International, the majority of those stoned are women and women are disproportionately affected by stoning because of sexism in the legal system.<ref>{{cite web|date=January 15, 2008|title=Amnesty International—Iran: Death by stoning, a grotesque and unacceptable penalty|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020184028/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|archive-date=October 20, 2013|website=amnesty.org}}</ref>

One study found that: <blockquote>[O]n average, women receive lighter sentences in comparison with men{{nbsp}}... roughly 30% of the gender differences in incarceration cannot be explained by the observed criminal characteristics of offense and offender. We also find evidence of considerable heterogeneity across judges in their treatment of female and male offenders.

A 2017 study by Knepper found that "female plaintiffs filing workplace sex discrimination claims are substantially more likely to settle and win compensation whenever a female judge is assigned to the case.
