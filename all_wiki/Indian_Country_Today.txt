'''''Indian Country Today''''' ('''''ICT''''') is a daily digital news platform that covers the Indigenous world, including American Indians, Alaska Natives and First Nations.

It was founded in 1981 as a weekly print newspaper, ''The Lakota Times''; the publication's name changed in 1992 to ''Indian Country Today''. It was acquired in 1998 by Four Directions Media, an enterprise of the [[Oneida Nation of New York]]. In January 2011, ICT became Indian Country Today Media Network (ICTMN), an online multimedia news platform. In June 2014, ICTMN had 1,009,761 unique monthly visitors, according to [[Google Analytics]];<ref>[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/09/indian-country-today-media-network-reaches-online-traffic-milestone-155736 ''Indian Country Today'', July 9, 2014]</ref>  and Indian Country Today's [[Facebook]] page received more than 500,000 [[Facebook like button|likes]]. In addition to the online news site, ICTMN published a weekly news magazine and special sections available online and in print.

On [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]] 2017, publication of new content was temporarily suspended to explore alternative [[business model]]s.<ref name="2017 suspension">{{cite news|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/native-news/indian-country-today-media-network-cease-active-operations/|title=Indian Country Today Media Network To Cease Active Operations|last=Halbritter|first=Ray|date=September 4, 2017|newspaper=Indian Country Media Network|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}</ref> In October 2017, the [[Oneida Nation of New York]] donated ICT to the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/native-news/oneida-nation-donate-indian-country-today-media-network-assets-ncai/|title=Oneida Nation to Donate Indian Country Today Media Network Assets to NCAI|last=|first=|date=2017-10-04|website=Indian Country Media Network|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-01-20}}</ref> [[Vincent Schilling]], ICT's former arts and entertainment editor, maintained the site and published articles until ''Indian Country Today'' came back online under NCAI's ownership.

On Feb. 28, 2018, ''Indian Country Today'' resumed regular publication with Mark Trahant ([[Fort Hall Indian Reservation|Shoshone-Bannock]]) as editor. Gradually new staff was added, with a renewed focus on Native American writers and editors. In March 2020, Katie Oyan ([[Oglala Lakota]]) was announced as the publication's first managing editor.<ref name=Oyan>"[https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/katie-oyan-named-as-first-managing-editor-of-indian-country-today-Ls4Oa0Q6UEOp6tG6pacLwg Katie Oyan named as first managing editor of Indian Country Today]" by Kolby KickingWoman, 19 March 2020.

==History==
ICT carries original news reporting on issues of interest to [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|Native American]]s and other readers interested in Indian Country.

'''• 1981-1998:''' ''Indian Country Today'' was founded in 1981 as ''The Lakota Times'' by journalist [[Tim Giago]], Oglala Lakota; Giago changed the publication's name in 1992 to ''Indian Country Today'' ('''motto: "The Nations' Leading American Indian News Source"'''). ICT was based on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] but operated independently of Tribal government.

'''• 1998-2017:''' In 1998, Giago sold ''Indian Country Today'' to Four Directions Media, Inc., an enterprise of the Oneida Nation of New York and the newspaper's headquarters moved to [[Canastota, New York]]. In 2011, operations moved to New York City <ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/about-us/  |title=About  |work=Indian Country Today Media Network}}</ref> and ''Indian Country Today'' became ''Indian Country Today Media Network'' ('''motto: "Serving the Nations | Celebrating the People"''').<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/indian-country-today-media-network-to-launch-january-14-2011-113009119.html  |title=Indian Country Today Media Network to Launch January 14, 2011  |work=RNewswire  |date=January 6, 2011 |accessdate=December 2, 2012}}</ref> In 2013, the printed newspaper ceased publication, replaced by digital-first online reporting and a weekly news magazine available online and in print.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/national-native-american-magazine-going-digital| title=National Native American Magazine Going Digital  |work=The Big Story  |last1=Eaton |first1=Kristi |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}</ref> In October 2017, the Oneida Nation of New York donated ICT to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI).

'''• 2018–present:''' On Feb. 28, 2018, after a hiatus during the transfer of ownership to NCAI, ''Indian Country Today'' announced its return. '''Its motto:''' '''"Digital. Indigenous. News."'''.<ref>[https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/native-news/official-indian-country-today-back/ Official - Indian Country Today Back]</ref> "Indian Country Today is a daily digital news platform that covers the Indigenous world, including American Indians and Alaska Natives. Indian Country Today is the largest news site that covers Tribes and Native people throughout the Americas. Our primary focus is delivering news to a national audience via a mobile phone or the web."

On July 24, 2019, Trahant and ''Indian Country Today'' headquarters moved to the campus of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications at Arizona State University in Phoenix. Trahant wrote on social media that he would be hiring a team to build a television show and improve ''ICT's'' national report. Associate Editor Schilling remained in the D.C. bureau.

By the end of the year, ICT had a bureau at Alaska Pacific University in Anchorage, in addition to its newsroom in Phoenix and its bureau in Washington, D.C. In February, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians awarded a grant of $1 million to ''Indian Country Today'' and became founding partner for a national news broadcast about American Indian and Alaska Native issues.

The coverage included a guest editorial by the president of the Charleston, South Carolina, branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/10/13/baby-veronica-baby-deseray-dont-let-them-sell-our-babies |title= Baby Veronica & Baby Deseray: Don't Let Them Sell Our Babies! |first1=Dot|last1=Scott|work=Indian Country Today Media Network |date=October 13, 2013 |accessdate=August 15, 2014}}</ref>

More than 104,000 people had signed a petition to President Obama, "We the People | Stop Apache Land Grab" to which the [[White House]] gave an official response.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/13/white-house-responds-stop-apache-land-grab-petition-158680 |last1=ICTMN Staff |title=White House Responds to 'Stop Apache Land Grab' Petition |newspaper=Indian Country Today Media Network |date=January 13, 2015 |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref>

The publication has featured numerous stories and editorials on the [[Washington Redskins name controversy]] and Washington NFL team owner [[Daniel Snyder|Dan Snyder]].

• Since before 2016, ICT reported on issues related to the Dakota Access pipeline project, which proposed to put an oil pipeline extending through four states below the Missouri River. The Standing Rock Sioux objected to the Army Corps of Engineers' acceptance of less than a full Environmental Impact Statement, saying the project threatened their water quality and would destroy ancient artifacts and burial grounds. Standing Rock Sioux sought an injunction to halt construction of the pipeline. The case attracted national and international attention and coverage.

After a federal court refused the injunction, the U.S. Department of Justice, Department of Interior and Army Corps of Engineers entered the case at the national level, halting construction temporarily. Standing Rock Sioux protesters at the site were joined by activists from hundreds of other Tribes and supporters, including indigenous peoples from South America. ICT published its first "single-subject, event-driven edition in [its] history" in October 2016, based on the reporting done and exploring the many complex issues related to the project and protests.<ref>[http://ictmn.lughstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DAPL-Magazine-2016_PREVIEW_r1.pdf ''Water Is Life: The NoDAPL Movement''], ''Indian Country Today'', October 2016; accessed 24 October 2016</ref>

• On Nov. 5, 2018, ''Indian Country Today'' teamed with FNX | First Nations Experience and Native Voice One in broadcasting and streaming the first national news report focused on Native American candidates from coast to coast. A team of 18 correspondents reported from sites across the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. The election desk was anchored by Mark Trahant, editor of ''Indian Country Today.''

She simply ignored us."<ref>Simon Moya-Smith, [https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/opinions/elizabeth-warren-native-heritage-where-has-she-been-moya-smith/index.html I am a Native American.
