==Biography==

===Early life===
Mykola Tomenko (born in a village of Mali Kanivtsi, [[Chornobai Raion]], currently [[Zolotonosha Raion]], in [[Cherkasy Oblast]] of Ukraine) is one of the few [[veteran]]s of the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet-Afghan War]] among the Ukrainian politicians. Between 1983 and 1985 Tomenko served his [[conscript]] service in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Russian Airborne Troops|Airborne Troops]], reaching a rank of [[Sergeant]] during the war.

In 1989, after his military service, Tomenko graduated from [[Kyiv University]] specializing in Ukrainian [[political history]]. Shortly after, in 1992 he obtained his [[Kandidat]] degree (roughly equivalent to [[Ph.D.]]) defending his thesis on the topic "The issue of statehood in the program, documents and activities of the present-day parties in Ukraine (historical-political analysis)."

During his student years, after initially being a [[Komsomol]] activist, Tomenko later became the initiator of the local Komsomol organization's dissolution.

Tomenko began his professional career in 1992 at the Institute of National Operation and Self-government as the Head of the Political Science Department. Between 1992-1998 he was the vice-president of the [[Foundation (charity)|Foundation]] "The Ukrainian Outlook", the director of the Institute of Post-communism Society and the Institute of Politics (listed are [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental politics research organizations]]). At the same time he continued lecturing history and political science courses at Kyiv universities, finally becoming the Head of the Politology department in the National University [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|"Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"]].

===Political career===
[[File:Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Mykola Tomenko.JPG|thumb|left|Mykola Tomenko seated with [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]], then the leader of the [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]].]]

In mid-1990s Tomenko began his political career as a member of "My" (Ukrainian for ''Us'') Political Union - a liberal-patriotic group close to [[Reforms and Order Party]]. In 1998 he was number 15 in the electoral list of [[Verhovna Rada|Parliament]] candidates for Reforms and Order Party, but the party obtained no seats in parliament.

In 2002 Tomenko was elected to the Parliament on the list of the "[[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]]" Block (which contained Reforms and Order Party).

In late 2005 he left the party over a split on whether to back [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] or President [[Viktor Yuschenko]] (at the time he accused [[Petro Poroshenko]] and other Yuschenko allies of [[corruption in Ukraine|corruption]]<ref>[https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/540626.html All In The Family: The Sequel], [[Kyiv Post]] (7 October 2016)</ref>), and became a member of [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]]. In 2006 Tomenko became elected to Verkhovna Rada on the list of that Bloc. Tomenko was placed at number 8 on the electoral list of [[Batkivshchina]] during the [[2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election]].<ref>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/58995 They Call Themselves the Opposition], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (31 August 2012)</ref><ref name="electedintoVRUK111112"/> He was re-elected into parliament.<ref name="electedintoVRUK111112">{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2012/11/11/6977259/ Список депутатів нової Верховної Ради], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (11 November 2012)</ref>

In the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] Tomenko was re-elected into parliament after being in the top 10 of the electoral list of [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc]].<ref name="General official results of Rada election 2014"/> On 25 December 2015 Tomenko left the party's parliamentary faction.<ref name=TouVrJ16/> On 25 March 2016 the party Congress of Petro Poroshenko Bloc withdraw his parliamentary mandate using the [[Imperative mandate (Ukraine)|Imperative mandate provisions]] of the [[Ukrainian constitution]].<ref name=TouVrJ16/> This was considered illegal by Tomenko; on 28 July 2016 Ukraine's highest Administrative Court rejected his appeal to gain back his parliamentary seat.<ref name=TouVrJ16/>

In April 2016 Tomenko founded and became the chairman of the “Native Land” organization aimed to "discuss an alternative public strategy for Ukraine".<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [https://zik.ua/news/2016/04/04/eksnardep_mykola_tomenko_stvoryv_i_ocholyv_ruh_ridna_kraina_687318 Former People's Deputy Mykola Tomenko created and headed the movement "Native land"], [[zik.ua]] (4 April 2016)</ref>

After declaring support for the candidature of [[Anatoliy Hrytsenko]] in the [[2019 Ukrainian presidential election]] Tomenko became the supervisor of Hrytsenko's media strategy in Hrytsenko's election headquarters.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2018/12/17/7201485/ The team of Gritsenko was replenished by two Nikolajs], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (17 December 2018)</ref>

In the July [[2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] Tomenko was placed in the top five in the top ten of the party list of [[Civil Position]].<ref>https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2019/06/10/7217683/</ref> But the party did not win any seats (winning 1.04% of the national vote and not one constituency).<ref>[https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-elections/2748306-cec-counts-100-percent-of-vote-in-ukraines-parliamentary-elections.html CEC counts 100 percent of vote in Ukraine's parliamentary elections], [[Ukrinform]] (26 July 2019)<br />{{in lang|ru}} [https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/articles/2019/07/21/7221526/ Results of the extraordinary elections of the People's Deputies of Ukraine 2019], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (21 July 2019)</ref>

Tomenko is a candidate (and party leader) for the [[Kyiv City Council]] and was simultaneously candidate for [[Mayor of Kyiv]] for the party "Native Land" in the [[2020 Kyiv local election]].<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2020/09/26/7267808/ Two former heads of the Kyiv City State Administration have been registered as candidates for mayors of Kyiv], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (26 September 2020)</ref><ref name="chesno.org/post/4222">{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.chesno.org/post/4222 Mykola Tomenko's top ten "Ridna Kraina" party: agrarian, journalist, singer and politicians], [[Civil movement "Chesno"]] (20 September 2020)</ref><ref>[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/674837.html Rada appoints next elections to local self-govt bodies for Oct 25], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (15 July 2020)</ref> He finished 8th place with 15.039 votes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://vybory.24tv.ua/vibori-mera-kiyiv-2020-rezultati-golosuvannya-ofitsiyno_n1437890 |script-title=uk:На виборах мера Києва переміг Кличко: хто пройшов до Київміськради |trans-title=Klitschko won the Kyiv mayoral election: who went to the Kyiv City Council |work=[[:uk:24 (телеканал)|24 Kanal]] |date=6 November 2020 |access-date=24 November 2020 |language=uk}}</ref> "Native Land" also failed to win any seats in the Kyiv City Council.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://vybory.24tv.ua/vibori-mera-kiyiv-2020-rezultati-golosuvannya-ofitsiyno_n1437890 |script-title=uk:На виборах мера Києва переміг Кличко: хто пройшов до Київміськради |trans-title=Klitschko won the Kyiv mayoral election: who went to the Kyiv City Council |work=[[:uk:24 (телеканал)|24 Kanal]] |date=6 November 2020 |access-date=24 November 2020 |language=uk}}</ref> The “Native Land” party was a continuation of the (2016 established) organization with  the same name.<ref name="chesno.org/post/4222"/>

==Political style==
Entering politics after studying it, Tomenko became a public speaker and hot issues commenter. This was criticized by his political opponents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In summer 2005, President [[Viktor Yuschenko]] became dissatisfied with Tomenko's public attitude towards coalition allies and accused him of willingness to "comment anything on Earth" and a lack of in-government team-play sense.
One controversy during Tomenko's political career occurred when the [[2005 Eurovision song contest]] was hosted in [[Kyiv]]. He openly supported the [[GreenJolly|GreenJolly music group]] as a candidate for representative of Ukraine. This caused criticism from [[show business]] professionals that alleged a poor choice and Tomenko's abuse of Deputy Prime Minister position during the process.

==Ukrainian Cultural Development==
Tomenko initiated several promotional programs to familiarize Ukraine to visitors as well as the well established residents with the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]] followed by the [[Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine]] and the Seven Most Scenic Routes of Ukraine.

Mykola Tomenko authored several scholarly books, more than a dozen of journal articles, and, an [[essay]], like "Theory of Ukrainian Love".
