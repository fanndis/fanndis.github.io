'''CNBC''' is an American [[pay television]] [[Business channels|business news channel]] that is owned by [[NBCUniversal Television and Streaming#NBCUniversal News Group|NBCUniversal News Group]], a division of [[NBCUniversal]], with both being ultimately owned by [[Comcast]].

CNBC was originally established on April 17, 1989 as a joint venture between [[NBC]] and [[Cablevision]] as the '''Consumer News and Business Channel'''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/27/business/the-media-business-new-cnbc-president.html |title=The Media Business; New CNBC President |work=[[The New York Times]]

==History==
[[File:111807f.jpg|thumb|left|325px|The newsroom at CNBC headquarters, also used to host ''[[Power Lunch]]'']]
CNBC had its beginnings in 1979 as the [[Satellite Program Network]] (SPN), showing a low-budget mix of old movies, instructional and entertainment programs. The channel later changed its name to Tempo Television. After initially signing a letter of intent to acquire Tempo,<ref>{{cite news

NBC and [[Cablevision]] initially operated CNBC as a 50-50 [[joint venture]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/10/business/the-media-business-television-nbc-walks-into-a-cable-minefield.html?pagewanted=2|title=The Media Business: Television; NBC Walks Into a Cable Minefield|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 19, 2007|date=April 10, 1989}}</ref> choosing to headquarter the channel in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]].

CNBC had considerable difficulty getting cable carriage at first, as many providers were skeptical of placing it alongside the longer-established [[Financial News Network]]. By the winter of 1990, CNBC was only in 17 million homes – less than half of FNN's potential reach – despite having the muscle of NBC standing behind it.<ref name="Fabrikant">{{cite news | author = Fabrikant, Geraldine | title = The Media Business; Surprise Pact By G.E. Unit To Buy FNN | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = February 27, 1991 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/27/business/the-media-business-surprise-pact-by-ge-unit-to-buy-fnn.html | accessdate = October 19, 2007}}</ref> The original financial television concept predates both CNBC and FNN, as several independent TV stations commenced financial programming starting in the late 1960s (WCIU Chicago & KWHY Los Angeles); as Gene Inger, a Registered Investment Advisor, pioneered financial programming in several cities; notably San Francisco, Miami / Fort Lauderdale; then his part-owned WWHT Channel 68 Newark (serving the NY market). Mr. Inger (never part of FNN) disengaged operationally after the sale of Channel 68 to Miami-based Wometco; and today Channel 68 is an NBC property. (Inger was a guest on CNBC for years and as of 2019 provides online commentary from Florida.)

However, around this time, FNN encountered [[Financial News Network#Downfall|serious financial difficulties]]. After a protracted bidding war with a [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]]-[[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] consortium (the former's assets would be used to build a [[Fox Business Network|rival channel]] almost two decades later),<ref name="Fabrikant" /> CNBC acquired FNN for $154.3 million on May 21, 1991 and immediately merged the two operations, hiring around 60 of FNN's 300-strong workforce.<ref name="Seattle">{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910526&slug=1285405|title=Purchase Of Fnn Boosts NBC's Cable-Market Share|date=May 26, 1991|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=July 21, 2008}}</ref> The deal increased the distribution of the newly enlarged network to over 40 million homes.<ref name="Seattle" /> Cablevision sold its 50% stake to NBC upon completion of the deal.<ref>{{cite news | author = Guy, Pat | title = NBC Wins FNN; Dow Jones Jilted | work = [[USA Today]] | date = February 27, 1991 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/4107507.html?dids=4107507&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS&date=Feb+27%2C+1991&author=Guy%2C+Pat&pub=USA+TODAY&edition=&startpage=B4&desc=NBC+Wins+FNN%3B+Dow+Jones+Jilted | accessdate = October 19, 2007}}</ref> With the full name "Consumer News and Business Channel" dropped, the network's daytime business programming was branded "CNBC/FNN Daytime," although this was phased out by 1992.

[[Roger Ailes]] was hired as the new president of CNBC in 1993, tasked by NBC CEO [[Bob Wright]] with turning around the struggling network. Under Ailes' leadership from 1993 through 1995, the $400 million network doubled in value, and its revenues tripled. In addition, Ailes oversaw the launch of a 1994 spin-off channel from CNBC, called "America's Talking."<ref>[[America's Talking]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} Ailes left CNBC and America's Talking in late 1995 when Microsoft and NBC created a joint venture to reprogram America's Talking as MSNBC.<ref>https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/18/how-foxs-ailes-changed-cable-news.html</ref>

CNBC grew during the 1990s, launching [[CNBC Asia|Asian]] and [[CNBC Europe|European]] versions of the channel in 1995 and 1996 respectively.<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Report 1995: Business Review: NBC | work = [[General Electric]] | url = http://www.ge.com/annual95/ibb10a18.htm | accessdate = July 16, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070612014628/http://www.ge.com/annual95/ibb10a18.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 12, 2007}}</ref> In 1997, CNBC formed a strategic alliance with Dow Jones, including content sharing with [[Dow Jones Newswires]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and the rebranding of the channel as "a service of NBC Universal and Dow Jones".<ref name="alliance">{{cite press release | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Dec_9/ai_20053978/pg_1 | title=NBC And Dow Jones To Form Global Business Television And Internet Alliance | publisher=[[NBC]], [[Dow Jones & Company]] | date=December 9, 1997 | accessdate=March 29, 2008}}</ref> CNBC's international channels were then merged into a 50-50 joint venture with their Dow Jones-owned rivals, London-based EBN (European Business News) and Singapore-based ABN (Asia Business News) in 1998,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/29924/0000029924-98-000002.txt|title=Form 10-K submitted by Dow Jones & Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]], [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]]|date=March 17, 1998|accessdate=July 16, 2007}}</ref> while ratings grew on the U.S. channel until the new [[millennium]]'s [[dot-com bubble]] burst in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2003/6/cnbc-brady.asp|title=CNBC Fell from Grace When the Bubble Burst.

NBC Universal reacquired full control of loss-making CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia from Dow Jones at the end of 2005. The licensing agreement between Dow and CNBC U.S. remained intact, however.<ref>{{cite news|last=Loades-Carter |first=Jonathan |url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto072120050044006171&page=1 |title=Dow Jones pulls out of joint venture with CNBC |work=[[Financial Times]] |accessdate=November 28, 2007 |date=July 21, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615001218/http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto072120050044006171&page=1 |archivedate=June 15, 2009 }}</ref>

Today, CNBC provides business news programming on weekdays from 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&nbsp;p.m., [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], while broadcasting [[talk show]]s, investigative reports, [[documentaries]], [[infomercial]]s, and other programs at all other times. A [[CNBC Ticker|rolling ticker]] provides real-time updates on share prices on the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]], [[NASDAQ]], and [[American Stock Exchange|AMEX]], as well as market indices, news summaries, and weather updates by NBC meteorologists (prior to March 27, 2006, all of CNBC's weather reports were provided by [[AccuWeather]]). A rotating top band of the screen rotates provides real-time updates on index and commodity prices from world markets.

On October 13, 2014, coincidentally the 11th anniversary of CNBC's relocation to its current facilities in Englewood Cliffs, NJ, CNBC switched to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation, in line with its [[CNBC Asia|Asian]] and [[CNBC Europe|European]] siblings (see "On-air presentation" below for more information). As of January 4, 2016, the network's 480i standard definition feed now shows the same 16:9 HD feed on its 4:3 picture, due to the application of the [[Active Format Description|AFD]] #10 flag.

On September 17, 2007, the network has also run hourly ''CNBC.com News Now'' update segments during business day programming. These short bulletins, which are around 30 seconds in length (similar to [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]] Right Now''), air before the start of the network's programs from ''Squawk on the Street'' through ''The Kudlow Report''. The ''CNBC.com News Now'' update segments were discontinued as of early 2010. These bulletins were reintroduced in 2015 and were renamed CNBC News Update. They are aired hourly, on the half-hour between 10:30&nbsp;a.m. and 4:30&nbsp;p.m. The bulletins are read by [[Sue Herera]].

CNBC also produced ''[[Nightly Business Report]]'', a 30-minute weeknight business newscast distributed to U.S. [[public television]] stations. Launched in 1979, CNBC assumed production of the series in 2013 and ended production in December 2019. ''NBR'' was hosted by CNBC personalities [[Sue Herera]] and [[Bill Griffeth]].

On August 24, 2020, CNBC announced that it would premiere a new evening news program hosted by former [[Fox News Channel]] anchor [[Shepard Smith]], ''The News with Shepard Smith'', on September 30. The upcoming program was described as being "non-partisan" and "fact-based".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ted|date=2020-08-24|title=CNBC Sets September 30 Premiere Date For Shepard Smith Newscast|url=https://deadline.com/2020/08/shaped-smith-cnbc-newscast-1203021432/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=Deadline|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Primetime and weekend business programming===
CNBC's breakout hit among its original series is ''[[Mad Money]]''. Hosted by money manager [[Jim Cramer]], the hour-long show gives stock advice to viewers who call to the program. The show also has a popular segment called "The Lightning Round". In August 2007, Cramer's on-air tirade about the weakening economy, which was seen during the "Stop Trading" segment on ''[[Street Signs (CNBC)|Street Signs]]'', received national attention and helped galvanize widespread support for the [[Federal Reserve Board]] to cut interest rates.

On January 24, 2007, the network launched a long-anticipated monthly newsmagazine called ''[[Business Nation]]'', which is anchored by award-winning journalist [[David Faber (CNBC)|David Faber]]. Each edition of the program covers three stories; a mixture of profiles, investigative pieces and features. The format of the show is structured similarly to [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Sports]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-10-30-cnbc_x.htm|title=CNBC looking to distinguish itself|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=July 16, 2007|date=October 30, 2006}}</ref>

Other special or weekend programming includes ''[[CNBC on Assignment]]'' (for example, ''[[The Age of Wal-Mart]]''), ''[[Cover to Cover (2005 TV program)|Cover to Cover]]'', ''[[Suze Orman|The Suze Orman Show]]'' and ''[[On the Money (2013 TV series)|On the Money]]''.

In the fall of 2011, CNBC began to brand its primetime lineup under the title ''CNBC Smart''. Continuing its focus on documentaries focusing on business, CNBC marketed ''Smart'' as "the place where the who's who comes to learn the what's what."<ref name=tvn-smart>{{cite web|title=CNBC Making Major Pitch For 'CNBC Smart' Block|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc-making-major-pitch-for-cnbc-smart-block_b128027|publisher=TVNewser|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}</ref> Since 2013, CNBC regularly shows one [[Premier League]] game at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. ET.

===Non-business programming===
CNBC has experimented with non-business programming during [[primetime]] hours with a mixed record of success, including a talk show hosted by [[Dennis Miller]]. The channel has at times rebroadcast several [[NBC]] programs, including ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[Deal or No Deal (American game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', ''[[The Apprentice: Martha Stewart]]'', and ''[[1 vs. 100 (American game show)|1 vs. 100]]''. Until 2017, CNBC participated in USA Network's coverage of the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] due to conflicts with ''[[WWE Raw]]''.<ref name=variety-foxwm>{{cite web|title=Westminster Kennel's Dog Show Leaves NBCU's USA for Fox Sports|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/westminster-kennel-club-dog-show-leaves-usa-fox-sports-1201550004/|website=Variety|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>

{{Anchor|Sports coverage}}
CNBC has occasionally served as an overflow outlet for [[NBC Sports]] programming; beginning in [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], CNBC has carried portions of NBC's [[Olympics on NBC|coverage]] of the [[Olympic Games]] outside of business day hours. The frequent delegation of [[curling]] coverage to CNBC during the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] helped the sport gain a cult following among the business community.<ref name=variety-cnbcspga/><ref name=nyt-curlingcnbc>{{cite news|title=On Wall Street, a Romance With Curling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/business/26curling.html?_r=0|accessdate=11 November 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref> In 2001, CNBC began a four-year deal to televise events from the [[Senior PGA Tour]], either live or tape delayed, with early-round coverage broadcast on cable feeds of [[Ion Television|Pax]]. CNBC president Bill Bolster stated that the decision was meant to help reduce CNBC's reliance on paid programming on weekends. PGA Tour commissioner [[Tim Finchem]] also felt that golf and business audiences were "extremely compatible" with each other.<ref name=variety-cnbcspga>{{cite web|title=CNBC drives Senior PGA b'cast deal|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/cnbc-drives-senior-pga-b-cast-deal-1117780910/|website=Variety|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>

Since the 2011–12 season, CNBC has shown coverage of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Stanley Cup playoffs]], produced as part of the ''[[NHL on NBC]]'' package.<ref name=variety-raisesnbcgame>{{cite web|title=NBC deal raises NHL's game|url=https://variety.com/2011/tv/news/nbc-deal-raises-nhl-s-game-1118043506/|website=Variety|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref> CNBC has also participated in NBC's ''[[Survival Sunday|Championship Sunday]]'' effort to broadcast all matches on the final day of the [[Premier League]] soccer season.<ref>{{cite press release|title=NBCUNIVERSAL PRESENTS UNPRECEDENTED COVERAGE OF PREMIER LEAGUE'S "CHAMPIONSHIP SUNDAY" ON MAY 11|publisher=[[NBC Sports]] Group|date=17 April 2014|url=http://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2014/04/16/nbcuniversal-presents-unprecedented-coverage-of-premier-leagues-championship-sunday-on-may-11/|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> In 2016, CNBC broadcast several [[NASCAR]] races (as part of the ''[[NASCAR on NBC]]'' package) due to scheduling conflicts with other NBCUniversal channels during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Lee|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/olympics-will-force-some-nascar-coverage-off-nbc-nbc-sports-669882/|title=Olympics will force some NASCAR coverage off NBC/NBC Sports|work=[[Motorsport.com]]|date=January 26, 2016 |accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>

==Ratings==
There is a fairly clear long-term correlation between the performance of global [[stock market]]s and the audience ratings of CNBC. The network had a difficult time attracting viewers in the first half of the decade, but has seen viewership increase from a 2005 bottom to record highs in 2008, coinciding with the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. CNBC continues to possess the wealthiest audience (in terms of average income) of any television channel in the United States.<ref name="Hempel">{{cite news|first=Jessi |last=Hempel |url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/03/31/news/companies/cnbc_pain.fortune/?postversion=2008033112 |title=CNBC Feels Your Pain... |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |date=March 31, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409205739/https://money.cnn.com/2008/03/31/news/companies/cnbc_pain.fortune/?postversion=2008033112 |archivedate=April 9, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, CNBC's ratings were increasing sharply along with the stock market, often beating those of [[CNN]] during market hours.<ref>{{cite news | author = Fishman, Charles | title = The Revolution Will Be Televised (on CNBC) | work = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] | date = May 2000 | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/35/cnbc.html | accessdate = July 17, 2007}}</ref> In 2000, daytime viewership of the network peaked at 343,000,<ref name="Topcik">{{cite news | author = Topcik, Joel | title = Wald Boosts Business at CNBC | work = [[Broadcasting & Cable]] | date = September 18, 2006 | url = http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6372783.html?display=People | accessdate = July 17, 2007}}</ref> around the time the [[Nasdaq Composite]] crossed 5000. However, when the [[dot-com bubble]] began to burst later that year, CNBC's viewing figures declined in tandem. The network's ratings steadily fell quarter after quarter, year after year, until bottoming in Q1 2005, with an average viewership of 134,000 during the day.<ref>{{cite news | author = Learmonth, Michael | title = CNBC on a Road Bound for Revamps | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = February 7, 2005 | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117917550.html?categoryid=1237&cs=1 | accessdate = October 19, 2007}}</ref> From the bottom, the network, along with the markets, rebounded significantly – average daytime viewership (6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m.) reached a 7-year high of 310,000 viewers in the first quarter of 2008.<ref name="Hempel" /> Coinciding with the extreme market volatility of the ongoing [[Economic crisis of 2008|global economic crisis]], ratings hit an all-time high of 416,000 in Q3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/September%20%2708%20P2+%20Ranker%20(LIVE+SD)%20FINAL.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028225128/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/September%20%2708%20P2%2B%20Ranker%20%28LIVE%2BSD%29%20FINAL.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 28, 2008 |title=Sep'08 P2+ Weekday Ranker |work=[[TV Newser]] |accessdate=October 25, 2008 |date=October 2, 2008 }}</ref> Although the figures remain considerably less than those achieved by [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] and [[CNN]] today, it has still had a 210% increase in viewership since the beginning of 2005.

The network often sees large spikes in viewership on days of major market moves. During the week of February 27, 2007, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its seventh-largest loss ever, CNBC's continuing coverage of events<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-rke3JXqb4 | title=Video: CNBC's Market Plunge Coverage | publisher=[[YouTube]] | accessdate=July 17, 2007 | date=February 27, 2007}}</ref> resulted in its best ratings week since the market crash after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], with ''Kudlow & Company'', ''Mad Money'', and ''Fast Money'' recording their best ratings ever in the coveted 25-54 demographic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/market_selloff_cnbcs_best_week_since_01_54378.asp |title=Market Selloff: CNBC's Best Week Since '01 |work=[[TV Newser]] |accessdate=July 17, 2007 |date=March 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204751/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/market_selloff_cnbcs_best_week_since_01_54378.asp |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> When the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|financial crisis]] wreaked havoc in the worldwide equity markets, CNBC recorded some of the highest ratings in the network's two-decade history.

While daytime viewership has rebounded from its 2005 lows, [[prime time|primetime]] ratings remain weak relative to those of other news networks<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/1Q'08%20(LIVESD)%20FINAL%20P2%20Cable%20News%20Program%20Ranker.pdf |title=1Q'08 P2+ Weekday Ranker |work=[[TV Newser]] |accessdate=May 21, 2008 |date=April 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528031025/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/1Q%2708%20%28LIVESD%29%20FINAL%20P2%20Cable%20News%20Program%20Ranker.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}</ref> and CNBC continues to try and rejuvenate its evening lineup. Along with developing new program formats such as ''Fast Money'' and ''Mad Money'', the network operates a "checkerboard" programming approach, airing various genres of shows including documentaries, town-hall style discussions and repeats of some NBC output.<ref>{{cite press release|title=CNBC Programming Schedule Changes |publisher=CNBC |date=June 8, 2006 |url=http://www.nbcumv.com/cnbc/release_detail.nbc/cnbc-20060608000000-cnbcprogrammingsch.html |accessdate=July 17, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

When discussing the network's ratings, CNBC management and press releases regularly suggest that considerable viewership, particularly during the daytime, is done "out of home" in places such as offices, restaurants, fitness centers, financial institutions, and hotel rooms.<ref>{{cite news | author = Greppi, Micehle | title = Q&A: CNBC President Mark Hoffman | work = [[TelevisionWeek]] | date = October 7, 2007 | url = http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/10/qa_cnbc_president_mark_hoffman.php | accessdate = October 19, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011190507/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/10/qa_cnbc_president_mark_hoffman.php | archive-date = October 11, 2007 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="ratingspresser">{{cite press release|title=CNBC Has Best August in Five Years |publisher=CNBC |date=August 31, 2007 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/20528897 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070813094518/http://www.cnbc.com/id/20528897 |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 13, 2007 |accessdate=October 19, 2007 }}</ref> As this demographic is not covered by [[Nielsen ratings]], CNBC claims that the network's true viewership is considerably higher than what is measured.<ref name="ratingspresser" />

On January 6, 2015, the ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that CNBC would be partnering with Cogent Research to calculate the viewership of its business day programming by surveying financial advisers and investors. This change will help to provide a more accurate measurement of the network's out-of-home viewership; Nielsen will still be used to track the viewership of its entertainment programming.<ref name=waj-cogentcnbc>{{cite news|title=CNBC to Stop Using Nielsen for Ratings|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/cnbc-to-stop-using-nielsen-for-ratings-1420520556?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsC|accessdate=7 January 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 6, 2014}}</ref>

==On-air presentation==
{{overly detailed|date=January 2017}}

===Ticker===
The CNBC Ticker is a computer simulation of [[ticker tape]] shown on the lower part of the screen during the network's live weekday business programming and on weekends during replays of ''Options Action'' (a Friday [[options trader]]'s debate program following ''Fast Money'' that airs from 5:30&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. ET, with the same crew as ''Fast Money''), from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 6:30&nbsp;a.m. ET (albeit with the ticker hidden during the commercial breaks), containing security and index symbols along with movements in their value, updated every 20 minutes, despite being advertised as "Real-Time".

====Flippers====
At the right of the screen above the ticker, three vertically stacked "flippers", provides index and commodity prices (although during commercial breaks, the flippers relocate to the top of the ticker in a horizontal fashion to make room for the commercials themselves, which in turn, grow to four, except during the 30 minutes to the opening and closing bells, and during trading, where a bigger rectangular box, covering part of the ticker, usually shows the current trading status for the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], and the fourth flipper is replaced by the CNBC bug with the current time of the six different time zones). On weekdays, the flippers are hidden during the commercial break leading to, and including the last segment of ''Fast Money'' and throughout ''Mad Money'', as the latter show uses different graphics which cover up the space (the three flippers however, remain in the right atop the ticker during weekend 6{{nbsp}}am ET replays of ''Options Action'').

===Music===
[[File:CNBC News Store - Detroit.jpg|thumb|CNBC News Store at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]]]]
[[File:CNBC News Store - Raleigh-Durham.jpg|thumb|CNBC News Store at [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]]]]

The music used from October 2003 to December 2005 was produced by [[615 Music]] of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. This music (though only edited versions of the arrangements for ''Street Signs'' and ''Closing Bell'') continues as of February 2009 to be used by CNBC Europe, although CNBC Asia ceased using it in March 2007. CNBC Europe continued also to use "CNBC Anthem" (a.k.a. "Bold & Grand"), which was composed by [[Edd Kalehoff]] and used by CNBC U.S. between 2000 and 2002. For its main channel ident used until a relaunch on September 30, 2008, the anthem was remixed, adding the NBC chimes to the music. However, it is still used for its "Europe Update" segments during U.S. programming. The current music package is composed by James Ryan of Rampage Music New York, a company that has also created music for co-owned [[WNBC]], also in New York City. Ryan also composed the network's 2002 music package. Willie Wilcox composed the themes for ''[[The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch|The Big Idea]]'', ''[[Mad Money]]'', ''Conversations with [[Michael Eisner]]'' and currently ''[[Fast Money (CNBC)|Fast Money]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=T-RackS |title=Willie Wilcox |url=http://www.t-racks.com/MainPhp.html?NewsDisplay.php&Id=618 |accessdate=July 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930100108/http://www.t-racks.com/MainPhp.html?NewsDisplay.php&Id=618 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref>

===Announcer===
CNBC's main voice-over announcer during business-day programming is Jim Birdsall, who also works for [[NFL Films]], and was the narrator in the commercials for [[pizza]] chain [[CiCi's Pizza]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000267984 | title=The voice of CNBC, live! | publisher=CNBC | date=17 April 2014 | accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref> In addition, Birdsall is the main station announcer for [[KING-TV]], the [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]]-owned NBC affiliate station in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]. The signature voice for CNBC Prime is Brian Lee. Lee also covers business-day announcer duties when Birdsall is absent.

The voice-over announcer for CNBC Europe is UK Based, Philip Banks.

===2014 picture format change to 16:9===
As previously mentioned, on October 13, 2014, CNBC switched to a full 16:9 letterbox picture, in line with its Asian and European siblings (both of which did the same thing on March 31 of that same year). As a result, both of the network's standard-definition and high-definition feeds now show the same 16:9 format. CNBC also updated its graphics package, replacing what had been used since March 1, 2010. The "flippers", which appeared across the top of the screen from December 19, 2005 to October 10, 2014, have returned to a bug and were moved back to the lower right of the screen. Its lower thirds are now the same as CNBC Asia and CNBC Europe, the former updated its own graphics package on February 9, 2015, with CNBC Europe following suit exactly a month later (March 9, 2015). In breaking news mode, the background color is changed from blue to red.

The graphics are designed by Sweden-based Magoo 3D studios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magoo3dstudios.com/work/cnbc201/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026123022/http://www.magoo3dstudios.com/work/cnbc201/ |archivedate=October 26, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>

==Partnerships==

===Dow Jones & Company===
Since December 1997, the network has held a strategic alliance with the publishing and financial information firm [[Dow Jones & Company]].<ref name="alliance" /> Under the agreement, CNBC has extensive access to the journalism of such outlets as [[MarketWatch]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [[Dow Jones Newswires]] and ''[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]'', with their reporters and editorial staff making frequent appearances on the channel.

==International channels==

{{main|List of CNBC channels}}
CNBC has operated international versions of the channel since 1995, when [[CNBC Asia]] originally launched. [[CNBC Europe]] followed in 1996. On December 9, 1997, [[Dow Jones & Company]] and [[NBC]] announced the merger of their international business news channels. This resulted in a merger of CNBC Europe with Dow Jones' [[European Business News]], and likewise of CNBC Asia with [[Asia Business News]]. From then (until January 2006) the international CNBC services carried the tagline "A Service of NBC (Universal) and Dow Jones" (or depending on other local partners, a variation of this tagline). Correspondents from Dow Jones Newswires contribute to the channels. On December 31, 2005, the sale by Dow Jones of its interests in the international CNBC channels took effect. On January 1, 2006, the "A Service of NBC Universal and Dow Jones" tagline was removed from the international CNBC channels, in line with this.

In 2007, CNBC Asia dropped the word "Asia" from its channel idents, on September 30, 2008, CNBC Europe similarly dropped the word "Europe" from its logo. This means the three major CNBC channels: U.S., Europe, and Asia are all known on-screen as simply CNBC.

[[CNBC Europe]] is headquartered in [[London]], and [[CNBC Asia]] is headquartered in [[Singapore]].

Besides [[CNBC Europe]] and [[CNBC Asia]], the network also operates a number of local business news channels in association with other companies. These channels include [[Class CNBC]] in Italy, [[CNBC-e]] in Turkey, [[CNBC Arabiya]] in the UAE, [[Nikkei CNBC]] in Japan, [[CNBC TV18]], [[CNBC Awaaz]], and CNBC Baazar(A special [[Gujarati language|Gujarati Language]] channel) in India, [[CNBC Pakistan]] in Pakistan and [[TVN CNBC]] in [[Poland]].

[[CNBC Europe]] and [[CNBC Asia]] are rebranded in some parts of the world with tickers containing local financial information. Examples include CNBC Nordic, CNBC Singapore, CNBC Hong Kong and CNBC Australia (CNBC Australia and Singapore also produce five-minute updates at 12:55&nbsp;p.m., 5:55&nbsp;p.m. and 9:55&nbsp;p.m. for free-to-air network, [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS TV]]).

In North America, [[CNBC World]] airs business programming from [[CNBC Europe]] and [[CNBC Asia]], as well as weekly magazine programs provided by [[CNBC TV18]] and the [[United Nations]].

In Canada, CNBC can be seen with most of the programming identical to the U.S. counterpart. However, due to Canadian programming rights, the 9:00&nbsp;p.m. slot which had shown television programming in the past such as ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', ''[[1 vs. 100 (American game show)|1 vs. 100]]'', and ''[[Heads Up Poker (TV series)|Heads Up Poker]]'', as well as any and all [[Olympic Games]] coverage that the channel continues to carry, are replaced by CNBC World programming. However, documentaries are shown in Canada. This had the making of a major problem, as a highlight episode of ''[[The Apprentice (American season 5)|The Apprentice 5]]'' that aired April 23, 2006, was assumed to not be available anywhere for Canadians due to these blackouts. While the first airing at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. ET was blacked out, the second airing at midnight ET was accidentally shown. Blackouts on episodes that originally air on [[NBC]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]] are likely to continue. However, occasionally, the television shows are shown and are not blacked out, possibly due to a mistake in transmission.

[[CNBC Africa]] was launched on June 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pfanner | first = Eric | title = CNBC pushes hard to fend off rival Fox | work = [[International Herald Tribune]] | date = October 1, 2006 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/01/business/tv02.php | accessdate = July 17, 2007}}</ref> With roughly $600 million spent on advertising in [[South Africa]] alone, the network sees great potential in grabbing a potential share of that pot. It has bureaus in [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and South Africa and produces nine hours of local programming per business day.

The launch of the [[Korean language]] channel [[SBS-CNBC]] in January 2010 marked the fifteenth CNBC-branded channel worldwide.<ref name="SBS-CNBCLaunch" />

On January 10, 2016, CNBC and [[Trans Corp|Trans Media]] announced a strategic partnership that will see the creation of the [[Indonesian language]] channel [[CNBC Indonesia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/10/cnbc-and-pt-trans-media-corpora-announce-indonesia-partnership.html|title=CNBC and PT Trans Media Corpora announce Indonesia Partnership|date= 10 January 2016|work=[[CNBC.com]]|accessdate=2016-07-04}}</ref>

==CNBC Audio==
CNBC business news and market reports are updated hourly and available on demand on [[Smart Speakers]] including [[Amazon Echo]] devices with [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]], [[Google Home]] and app devices with [[Google]] Assistant, and on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Siri]] voice interfaces including [[iPhones]].<ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/24/amazon-echo-tips-and-tricks.html]</ref> Many CNBC TV shows such as [[Mad Money]] and [[American Greed]] are available as podcasts for on-demand listening. Original content podcasts include "Strange Success" with [[Jane Wells]], "Speakeasy" with [[John Harwood (journalist)|John Harwood]], and "Fort Knox" with Jon Fortt.<ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/podcasts/]</ref>

==CNBC.com==
CNBC.com is the companion website to the financial network. It was launched in 1996 with minimal content, other than showing program grids, host biographies and basic network images (on the internet, business news then was handled by msnbc.com, which later became [[NBCNews.com]]). The site gradually progressed alongside internet technology, giving investors more useful information such as stock quotes, news bulletins, in-depth programming information and a whole host of other data.

In August 2001, CNBC.com merged with [[MSN]]'s Moneycentral.com, creating "CNBC on MSN." This new partnership allowed the two parties to meet two objectives: 
#provide richer content to visitors, with expanded news offerings, a wider array of stock tools (including interactive charting, free online portfolio managers) plus more in-depth market coverage and
# more effectively compete with other finance related websites, such as [[MarketWatch|Marketwatch.com]], [[AOL Finance]] and [[Yahoo! Finance]].

During this period, the editorial content on the CNBC.com site was controlled by [[Microsoft Corporation]]. CNBC.com officially ended its relationship with [[MSN]] in mid-November 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/msn-money-same-microsoft-money-20698.html |publisher=[[AZ Central]] |title=Is MSN Money the Same as Microsoft Money? |date=5 December 2006}}</ref>

CNBC.com was relaunched on December 4, 2006. The website provides new online tools for investors and better integration of the website with daytime programming. Some of the new features include:
* exclusive online interviews (the first being with Chicago Fed President Michael Moskow)
* live market updates from CNBC personalities three times per day during the trading day (discontinuing the "Market in a Minute" updates in June 2007)
* a streaming desktop ticker, real-time data and the network's "tick-by-tick" charts (for major indices)
* themed blogs by various correspondents (i.e., "Tech Check" with tech reporter Jim Goldman)
* unedited, full-length interviews from CNBC specials or other on-air interviews
* free video of recent on-air segments, interviews, features etc.
* an exclusive "CNBC.com" set built at CNBC's U.S. headquarters from which the market update segments (among other things) are taped
* blogging from on-air personalities about the various "goings-on" within the network
* an original show to air exclusively online with Maria Bartiromo, Bill Griffeth and Joe Kernen (yet to debut)<ref>{{cite news

Content on the new website is edited 24 hours a day during the business week. CNBC U.S. updates the content from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. ET, CNBC Asia then takes over from 7:00&nbsp;p.m. to 2:00&nbsp;a.m., and CNBC Europe handles the remaining four hours.

In August 2012, CNBC.com attracted 6.9 million unique visitors, according to comScore Media Metrix. Its [[iPad]] app recorded 547,000 unique visitors and its [[iPhone]] app attracted 551,000 unique visitors.<ref>{{cite news | last = Roush | first = Chris | title = CNBC.com sees drop in August readers | date = September 15, 2012 | url = http://www.talkingbiznews.com/1/cnbc-com-sees-drop-in-august-readers/}}</ref>

This format was used from its launch on October 10, 2007 through October 10, 2014. The screenshot above was taken during ''Closing Bell'' on April 9, 2014.]]
'''CNBC HD''' (formerly '''CNBC HD+''') is a [[1080i]] [[high-definition television|high-definition]] enhanced [[simulcast]] of CNBC, that was launched on October 10, 2007. The channel used a modified screen format during trading-day programming, which shifted the existing [[4:3]] feed to the left of the screen to add a sidebar on the right side of the screen (which contained additional market statistics and a window showing video content from CNBC.com, whose audio was carried on [[Second audio program|SAP]] until 2011, when the service seemed to be discontinued; silent video promos for upcoming and primetime programming were aired in the window), and a wider version of the ticker. Primetime programming is shown in full-screen 16:9 and usually produced in HD.

On May 30, 2012, the right sidebar graphic was changed to show headlines (business news and otherwise), upcoming corporate earnings releases, upcoming economy data, easier-to-read charts, market statistics and stories coming up on the program being aired. On May 7, 2013, the CNBC HD ticker grew in size to match its standard-definition counterpart. The five "flippers" on the top were dropped to four, with the fourth one (on the upper right-hand corner of the screen) displaying the times of day in each global time zone (Eastern, Central, Pacific, London, Dubai, Singapore). On July 25, 2013, the right sidebar graphic was changed again, this time to show slightly larger displays (including charts).

On October 13, 2014, CNBC HD was relaunched, due to the aforementioned network-wide switch to a full-screen 16:9 presentation. The sidebar graphic was permanently removed as well (having started with ''Mad Money'' on August 4 of the same year and before that, during commercial breaks), which in turn, led to all other live shows being presented in full-screen 16:9 and therefore, eliminating the enhanced format altogether.

[[DirecTV]] was the first provider to introduce CNBC HD, with various others eventually taking suit (all of the providers have the HD feed as of the October 13, 2014 redesign).<ref>{{cite news | last = Dickson | first = Glen | title = CNBC To Throw HD Switch | work = [[Broadcasting & Cable]] | date = September 17, 2007 | url = http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6478870.html | accessdate = September 17, 2007}}</ref>
