'''Ehud Olmert''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|l|m|ər|t|,_|-|m|ɛər|t}};<ref>[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/olmert "Olmert"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{lang-he-n|אֶהוּד אוֹלְמֶרְט}}, {{IPA-he|eˈhud ˈolmeʁt|IPA|Ehud olmert.ogg}}; born 30 September 1945) is an Israeli politician and lawyer. He served as the 12th [[Prime Minister of Israel]] from 2006 to 2009 and before that as a [[cabinet minister]] from 1988 to 1992 and from 2003 to 2006. Between his first and second stints as a cabinet member, he served as [[mayor of Jerusalem]] from 1993 to 2003. After serving as PM he was sentenced to serve a prison term over convictions for accepting bribes and for obstruction of justice during his terms as mayor of Jerusalem and as trade minister.

==Early life==
Olmert was born near [[Binyamina]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. According to Olmert, his parents, Bella (Wagman) and [[Mordechai Olmert]], escaped "persecution in [[Ukraine]] and Russia, and found sanctuary in [[Harbin]], China. They emigrated to Israel to fulfill their dream of building a [[Jewish and democratic state]] living in peace in the land of our ancestors."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.israelemb.org/articles/2006/May/2006052400.htm |title=Address by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to Joint meeting of US Congress |work=Israel Embassy Washington, D.C. |date=24 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817060550/http://www.israelemb.org/articles/2006/May/2006052400.htm |archive-date=17 August 2007 |access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref> His father later became a member of the Knesset for [[Herut]]. Olmert's childhood included membership in the [[Betar|Beitar Youth Organization]] and dealing with the fact that his parents were often blacklisted and alienated due to their affiliation with the Jewish militia group the [[Irgun]]. They were also part of Herut, the opposition to the long-ruling [[Mapai]] party. However, by the 1970s, this was proving less detrimental to one's career than during the 1950s.

==Education and Military Service==
Olmert graduated from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] with degrees in [[psychology]], philosophy and law. He opened a successful law partnership in [[Jerusalem]]. Olmert served with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in the [[Golani Brigade]].<ref>{{cite news

During the [[Yom Kippur War]], he joined the headquarters of [[Ariel Sharon]] as a military correspondent. Already a member of the [[Knesset]], he decided to go through an officer's course in 1980 at the age of 35.

==MK and Minister==
In 1966, during the [[Gahal]] party convention (a predecessor to today's [[Likud]]), party leader [[Menachem Begin]] was challenged by the young Olmert, who called for his resignation. Begin announced that he would retire from party leadership, but soon reversed his decision when the crowd emotionally pleaded with him to stay. Olmert was first elected to the [[Knesset]] in 1973 at the age of 28, and was re-elected seven consecutive times. Between 1981 and 1989, he served as a member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and served on the Finance, Education and Defense Budget Committees. He served as [[minister without portfolio]], responsible for minority affairs between 1988 and 1990, and as minister of health from 1990 until 1992. Following Likud's defeat in the 1992 election, instead of remaining a Knesset member in the opposition, he successfully ran for mayor of Jerusalem in November 1993.

==Mayor of Jerusalem==
[[File:Imagem 214 600x600 100KB.jpg|thumb|Bronze plate situated in the [[Wire Opera House]] in [[Curitiba]], Brazil, commemorating Olmert's visit as mayor of Jerusalem]]
Between 1993 and 2003, Olmert served two terms as mayor of [[Jerusalem]], the first member of [[Likud]] or its precursors to hold the position. During his term in office, he devoted himself to the initiation and advancement of major projects in the city, the development and improvement of the education system, and the development of road infrastructure. He also spearheaded the development of the [[light rail]] system in Jerusalem, and the investment of millions of [[Israeli new sheqel|shekels]] in the development of [[mass transportation]] options for the city.

While mayor of Jerusalem, Olmert was an invited speaker at an international conflict resolution conference held in [[Derry]], Northern Ireland. In his address, he spoke of how "Political leaders can help change the psychological climate which affects the quality of relationships among people." His speech concluded with reflections on the importance of political process in overcoming differences: "How are fears born? They are born because of differences in tradition and history; they are born because of differences in emotional, political and national circumstances. Because of such differences, people fear they cannot live together. If we are to overcome such fear, a credible and healthy political process must be carefully and painfully developed. A political process that does not aim to change the other or to overcome differences, but that allows each side to live peacefully in spite of their differences."<ref>{{cite news

==Deputy leader of Israel==
Olmert was elected as a member of the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|sixteenth Knesset]] in January 2003. He served as the head of the election campaign for [[Likud]] in the elections, and subsequently was the chief negotiator of the coalition agreement. Following the elections he was appointed as [[Acting Prime Minister of Israel|Designated Acting Prime Minister]] and [[Industry, Trade and Labour Minister of Israel|Minister of Industry, Trade and Labor]]. From 2003 to 2004, he also served as [[Communications Minister of Israel|Minister of Communications]].

On 7 August 2005, Olmert was appointed acting [[Finance Minister of Israel|finance minister]], replacing [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], who had resigned in protest against the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|planned Israeli withdrawal]] from the [[Gaza Strip]].<ref>{{cite news

After his appointment, Olmert said:<blockquote>I voted against [[Menachem Begin]], I told him it was a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, and so on and so on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong.

==Acting prime minister==
On 4 January 2006, as the [[Acting Prime Minister of Israel|designated Acting Prime Minister]], Olmert became [[Acting Prime Minister of Israel|Acting Prime Minister]] as a result of the serious stroke suffered by then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. This occurred after consultations took place between [[Cabinet Secretary]] [[Yisrael Maimon]] and [[Attorney General of Israel|Attorney General]] [[Menachem Mazuz]], who declared Sharon "temporarily incapable to carry out the duties of his office", while only officially in office. Then, Olmert and the cabinet reaffirmed in an announcement that the [[2006 Israel legislative election|28 March elections]] would be held as scheduled. During the days following the stroke, Olmert met with [[Shimon Peres]] and other Sharon supporters to try to convince them to stay with Kadima, rather than return to [[Likud]] or, in Peres' case, [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor]]. On 16 January 2006, Olmert was elected chairman of Kadima, and Kadima's candidate for prime minister in the upcoming election.<ref>{{cite news

Following the March 2006 election, Kadima won 29 seats, making it the largest party. On 6 April, Olmert was officially asked by President [[Moshe Katsav]] to form a government. Olmert had an initial period of 28 days to form a governing [[coalition government|coalition]], with a possible two-week extension. On 11 April, the Israeli Cabinet deemed that Sharon was incapacitated. The 100-day replacement deadline was extended due to the Jewish festival of [[Passover]], and a provision was made that, should Sharon's condition improve between 11 and 14 April, the declaration would not take effect. Therefore, the official declaration took effect on 14 April, formally ending Sharon's term as prime minister and making Olmert the country's new Interim Prime Minister in office (he would not become the official prime minister until he formed a government).

On 9 December 2006, Olmert stated that he could not rule out the possibility of a military attack against [[Iran]], and called for the international community to step up action against that country. He called Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s repeated threats to destroy Israel "absolutely criminal", and said that he expected "more dramatic steps to be taken". In an interview with German TV network [[Sat.1]] on 11 December 2006, Olmert included Israel in a list of nuclear powers, saying: "Iran, openly, explicitly and publicly, threatens to wipe Israel off the map. Can you say that this is the same level, when they are aspiring to have nuclear weapons, as America, France, Israel and Russia?" He immediately attempted to backtrack, insisting that Israel's doggedly held position of nuclear weapons ambiguity had not changed.<ref>{{cite news

===Annapolis peace talks===
Olmert welcomed the [[Arab League]]'s 2007 re-endorsement of the [[Arab Peace Initiative]]. Olmert wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper that Israel was ready to make "painful concessions" to achieve peace with the Palestinians.
<blockquote>"I take the offer of full normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab world seriously; and I am ready to discuss the Arab peace initiative in an open and sincere manner. Working with our Jordanian and Egyptian partners, and hopefully other Arab states, we must pursue a comprehensive peace with energy and vision.... But the talks must be a discussion, not an ultimatum."<ref>{{cite news

"If the day comes when the two-state solution collapses, and we face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights (also for the Palestinians in the territories), then, as soon as that happens, the State of Israel is finished", Olmert said on the last day of the [[Annapolis Conference]]. "The Jewish organizations, which were our power base in America, will be the first to come out against us", Olmert said, "because they will say they cannot support a state that does not support democracy and equal voting rights for all its residents".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/929439.html |title=Two-state solution, or Israel is done for |work=Haaretz |date=29 November 2007 |access-date=30 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506110123/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/929439.html |archive-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

During the talks, Olmert agreed that Israel would share [[Jerusalem]] as the joint capital of Israel and a Palestinian state and hand over its holy sites to a multinational committee, land swaps that would allow Israel to keep its major settlement blocs in the [[West Bank]], the construction of a tunnel connecting the West Bank and the [[Gaza Strip]], and a demilitarized Palestinian state with an American-led international security force stationed on the Palestinian–Jordanian border. Both sides disagreed over how much land would be exchanged in the swaps, with Olmert demanding at least 6.3–6.8% of the West Bank and Abbas insisting a swap would not exceed 1.9%.<ref name="Thrall" >[[Nathan Thrall]],  [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/aug/15/what-future-israel/ 'What Future for Israel?,'] [[New York Review of Books]] 15 August 2013 pp.64-67.</ref>  In his memoirs, Olmert wrote that he agreed Israel would generously compensate the remaining refugees. Olmert later stated that U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] offered to accept another 100,000 refugees as American citizens if a peace agreement was signed. U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] wrote in her memoirs that the Palestinians demanded they be allowed to negotiate additional "returns" to Israel following the peace deal, insisting that the [[Palestinian right of return|right of return]] was a matter of individual choice that would ultimately have to apply to every refugee. In his memoirs, Olmert claimed that he and Abbas were very close to an agreement, but Abbas' hesitation, Olmert's legal troubles, and the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] caused the talks to end. President Bush wrote in his memoirs that the talks broke down when Olmert announced that he would resign from office, and Abbas then broke off the talks and refused to finalize an agreement on the grounds that he did not want to sign a peace deal with a Prime Minister on his way out of office.<ref>{{cite news

During at least two meetings, Olmert made a secret promise to Abbas: Once a prisoner exchange deal for captive Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]] was finalized with [[Hamas]], Israel would bolster Abbas' government by releasing [[Fatah]] prisoners. After a [[Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange|prisoner exchange deal]] was agreed upon in 2011 under Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], Olmert's successor, Palestinian officials demanded that Netanyahu live up to Olmert's promise and release Fatah prisoners.<ref>{{cite news

===Operation Orchard===
{{further|Operation Orchard}}
On 6 September 2007, Israel launched [[Operation Orchard]], an airstrike against a suspected nuclear reactor in [[Syria]], allegedly being built with North Korean and Iranian assistance. The strike was preceded by years of covert operations by Israeli special forces and the [[Mossad]]. Details of the strike were censored in Israel, and the attack was not confirmed to have taken place until 2 October. Following the attack, Olmert's approval rating rose to 35%.

President Bush wrote in his memoirs that Olmert had first asked him to bomb the facility, but ordered the attack after Bush refused and told him that he would prefer diplomatic action and sanctions. Following the strike, Bush claimed to have suggested to Olmert to hide the strike for a while and then make it public as a way to isolate the Syrian government, but Olmert asked for total secrecy, wanting to avoid anything that could force Syria to retaliate.<ref name="bush memoirs"/> However, Israeli columnist [[Caroline Glick]] wrote that Israel had bowed to US demands in concealing the airstrike.<ref>{{cite news|last=Glick|first=Caroline|title=''Hardball with Washington'': Column One|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}</ref>

===Controversial UN vote===
The [[UN Security Council]] passed a resolution on 8 January 2009 calling for an immediate ceasefire to the hostilities in the Gaza Strip. It passed 14–0–1, with one abstention from the United States. Olmert told reporters, "[U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]]] was left shamed. A resolution that she prepared and arranged, and in the end she did not vote in favor. In the night between Thursday and Friday, when the Secretary of State wanted to lead the vote on a ceasefire at the Security Council, we did not want her to vote in favor. I said 'get me [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] on the phone'. They said he was in the middle of giving a speech in [[Philadelphia]]. I said I didn't care. 'I need to talk to him now'. He got off the podium and spoke to me. I told him the United States could not vote in favor. It cannot vote in favor of such a resolution. He immediately called the Secretary of State and told her not to vote in favor."<ref>{{cite news

==Corruption and bribery criminal investigations==
Beginning in the mid-1980s, Olmert was subjected to a string of corruption allegations that resulted in multiple police investigations. According to Israeli journalist [[Yossi Melman]], the repeated investigations led some to believe that Olmert was corrupt but a master at covering his tracks, while others believed that the authorities were simply obsessed with harassing him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.583096|title=One of Israel's best prime ministers, but corrupt|date=1 April 2014|work=Haaretz.com|access-date=1 December 2014}}</ref>

In July 2008, ''[[Haaretz]]'' reported that in 1992, Olmert took a loan from U.S. businessman Joe Almaliah, but never repaid it, and concealed the true size of the loan from the State Comptroller. In March 2003, State Comptroller [[Eliezer Goldberg]] asked Olmert to submit the wealth-declaration statement required of all cabinet ministers. Olmert disclosed that he had taken a loan from Almaliah, but did not say when it was due. In 2004, Olmert conceded that he had taken $75,000, and stressed that Almaliah had not asked for repayment of the loan. At Goldberg's insistence, Olmert signed a contract with Almaliah undertaking to repay the loan in January 2009. According to an indictment, Olmert had actually taken another $100,000 from Almaliah, which was deposited into his personal bank account. The State Prosecutor's office said that it was not aware of Olmert's repayment of either loan.<ref>{{cite news

Olmert resisted calls to resign, and stated: "I never took bribes, I never took a penny for myself.

On 26 November 2008, Attorney General [[Menachem Mazuz]] informed Olmert that he decided to file an indictment against him in what has come to be known as "Rishon Tours" affair, pending a hearing before Mazuz. The scheme allegedly worked as follows: Olmert would speak abroad on behalf of groups such as the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, a support group for the [[Israel Defense Forces]] or a charity for mentally disabled Israeli children. Rishon Tours then billed each group for the same trip as if they alone were paying, and placed the money in a special bank account allegedly for Olmert's personal use.
