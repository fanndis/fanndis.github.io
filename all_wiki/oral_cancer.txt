<!-- Prevention and treatment -->
Oral cancer can be prevented by avoiding tobacco products, limiting alcohol use, sun protection on the lower lip, HPV vaccination, and avoidance of paan. Treatments used for oral cancer can include a combination of [[surgery]] (to remove the tumor and [[Neck dissection|regional lymph nodes]]), [[radiation therapy]], [[chemotherapy]], or [[targeted therapy]].  The types of treatments will depend on the size, locations, and spread of the cancer taken into consideration with the general health of the person.<ref name="Marx" />

<!-- Epidemiology and history -->

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Cervical lymphadenopathy right neck.png|thumb|Swelling of the right neck from the spread of oral cancer.]][[File:Left lower lip cancer.jpg|thumb|right|Ulceration on the left lower lip caused by cancer]]
The signs and symptoms of oral cancer depend on the location of the [[tumor]] but are generally thin, irregular, white patches in the mouth. They can also be a mix of red and white patches (mixed red and white patches are much more likely to be cancerous when biopsied). The classic warning sign is a persistent rough patch with [[ulceration]], and a raised border that is minimally painful. On the lip, the ulcer is more commonly crusting and dry, and in the [[pharynx]] it is more commonly a mass. It can also be associated with a white patch, loose teeth, bleeding gums, persistent [[ear ache]], a feeling of numbness in the lip and chin, or swelling.<ref name="textbookom">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unNtAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA387|page=387|title= Textbook of Oral Medicine, Oral Diagnosis and Oral Radiology|editor= Ravikiran Ongole, Praveen B N|isbn= 978-8131230916|year=2014|publisher= Elsevier India}}</ref>

When the cancer extends to the [[pharynx|throat]], there can also be [[difficulty swallowing]], [[Odynophagia|painful swallowing]], and an altered voice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/oral/signs-and-symptoms/?region=on|title=Symptoms of oral cancer—Canadian Cancer Society|website=www.cancer.ca|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref> Typically, the lesions have very little pain until they become larger and then are associated with a burning sensation.<ref name=":16">{{cite journal | vauthors = Markopoulos AK | title = Current aspects on oral squamous cell carcinoma | journal = The Open Dentistry Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 126–30 | date = 2012-08-10 | pmid = 22930665 | pmc = 3428647 | doi = 10.2174/1874210601206010126 }}</ref> As the lesion spreads to the [[lymph node]]s of the neck, a painless, hard mass will develop. If it spreads elsewhere in the body, general aches can develop, most often due to [[bone metastasis]].<ref name=":16" />

==Causes==
Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a disease of environmental factors, the greatest of which is tobacco. Like all environmental factors, the rate at which cancer will develop is dependent on the dose, frequency and method of application of the [[carcinogen]] (the substance that is causing the cancer).<ref name="IARC"/> Aside from cigarette smoking, other carcinogens for oral cancer include alcohol, viruses (particularly HPV 16 and 18), radiation, and UV light.<ref name="Marx" />

=== Tobacco ===
[[Tobacco]] is the greatest single cause of oral and pharyngeal cancer. It is a known multi-organ [[carcinogen]], that has a [[interaction|synergistic interaction]] with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to cause cancers of the mouth and pharynx by directly damaging cellular DNA.<ref name="IARC">{{cite journal | title = Personal habits and indoor combustions.

=== Alcohol ===
Some studies in Australia, Brazil and Germany pointed to alcohol-containing mouthwashes as also being potential causes. The claim was that constant exposure to these alcohol-containing rinses, even in the absence of smoking and drinking, leads to significant increases in the development of oral cancer. However, studies conducted in 1985,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mashberg A, Barsa P, Grossman ML | title = A study of the relationship between mouthwash use and oral and pharyngeal cancer | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 110 | issue = 5 | pages = 731–4 | date = May 1985 | pmid = 3859544 | doi = 10.14219/jada.archive.1985.0422 }}</ref> 1995,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Elmore JG, Horwitz RI | title = Oral cancer and mouthwash use: evaluation of the epidemiologic evidence | journal =  	Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery | volume = 113 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–61 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 7675486 | doi = 10.1016/S0194-5998(95)70114-1 | s2cid = 20725009 }}</ref> and 2003<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cole P, Rodu B, Mathisen A | title = Alcohol-containing mouthwash and oropharyngeal cancer: a review of the epidemiology | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 134 | issue = 8 | pages = 1079–87 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12956348 | doi = 10.14219/jada.archive.2003.0322 }}</ref> summarize that alcohol-containing mouth rinses are not associated with oral cancer.

===Human papillomavirus===
{{main|HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer}}

Infection with [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), particularly type 16 (there are over 180 types), is a known risk factor and independent causative factor for oral cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gillison ML, Chaturvedi AK, Anderson WF, Fakhry C | title = Epidemiology of Human Papillomavirus-Positive Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 33 | issue = 29 | pages = 3235–42 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26351338 | pmc = 4979086 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2015.61.6995 }}</ref> A fast-growing segment of those diagnosed does not present with the historic stereotypical demographics.

Recent research from multiple peer-reviewed journal articles indicates that HPV16 is the primary risk factor in this new population of oral cancer victims. HPV16 (along with HPV18) is the same virus responsible for the vast majority of all [[cervical cancer]]s and is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the US. Oral cancer in this group tends to favor the tonsil and tonsillar pillars, base of the tongue, and the [[oropharynx]]. Recent data suggest that individuals who develop the disease from this particular cause have a significant survival advantage,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/2010/06/hpv-positive-tumor-status-indicates-better-survival-in-patients-.html|title=HPV-Positive Tumor Status Indicates Better Survival in Patients with Oropharyngeal Cancer—MD Anderson Cancer Center|website=www.mdanderson.org}}</ref> as the disease responds better to radiation treatments than tobacco caused disease.

===Betel nut===
[[File:Sweet Beeda.jpg|thumb|right|Stall selling betel quid]]
Chewing [[betel]], [[paan]] and [[Areca]] is known to be a strong risk factor for developing oral cancer even in the absence of tobacco. It increases the rate of oral cancer 2.1 times, through a variety of genetic and related effects through local irritation of the mucous membrane cells, particularly from the areca nut and slaked lime.<ref name="IARC"/> In [[India]] where such practices are common, oral cancer represents up to 40% of all cancers, compared to just 4% in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

===Stem cell transplantation===
People after [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (HSCT) are at a higher risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma. Post-HSCT oral cancer may have more aggressive behavior with poorer prognosis, when compared to oral cancer in people not treated with HSCT.<ref name="HSCT">{{cite journal | vauthors = Elad S, Zadik Y, Zeevi I, Miyazaki A, de Figueiredo MA, Or R | title = Oral cancer in patients after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation: long-term follow-up suggests an increased risk for recurrence | journal = Transplantation | volume = 90 | issue = 11 | pages = 1243–4 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21119507 | doi = 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181f9caaa }}</ref> This effect is supposed to be owing to the continuous lifelong [[immune system|immune]] suppression and chronic oral [[graft-versus-host disease]].<ref name="HSCT" />

===Premalignant lesions===
[[File:Severe dysplasia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Oral [[leukoplakia]] (white patch) on the left tongue. Proven to be severe dysplasia on biopsy]]
A [[premalignant]] (or precancerous) lesion is defined as "a benign, morphologically altered tissue that has a greater than normal risk of malignant transformation." There are several different types of premalignant lesion that occur in the mouth. Some oral cancers begin as white patches ([[leukoplakia]]), red patches ([[erythroplakia]]) or mixed red and white patches (erythroleukoplakia or "speckled leukoplakia"). Other common premalignant lesions include [[oral submucous fibrosis]] and [[actinic cheilitis]].<ref name="Neville 2002">{{cite book|vauthors=Neville BW, Damm DD, Allen CM, Bouquot JE|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|url=https://archive.org/details/oralmaxillofacia00nevi|url-access=limited|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0721690032|pages=[https://archive.org/details/oralmaxillofacia00nevi/page/n349 337], 345, 349, 353|edition=2nd}}</ref> In the Indian subcontinent oral submucous fibrosis is very common due to [[areca nut|betel nut]] chewing. This condition is characterized by limited opening of mouth and burning sensation on eating of spicy food. This is a progressive lesion in which the opening of the mouth becomes progressively limited, and later on even normal eating becomes difficult. It occurs almost exclusively in India and Indian communities living abroad.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Carcinogenesis}}
Oral [[squamous cell carcinoma]] is the end product of an unregulated proliferation of mucous basal cells. A single precursor cell is transformed into a clone consisting of many daughter cells with an accumulation of altered genes called [[oncogenes]]. What characterizes a malignant tumor over a benign one is its ability to metastasize. This ability is independent of the size or grade of the tumor (often seemingly slow growing cancers like the adenoid cystic carcinoma can metastasis widely). It is not just rapid growth that characterizes a [[cancer]], but their ability to secrete enzymes, angiogeneic factors, invasion factors, growth factors and many other factors that allow it to spread.<ref name="Marx" />

==Diagnosis==
[[File:SquamousCellCarcinomaTongueCT.png|thumb|A large squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue as seen on CT imaging]]
[[File:Squamous cell carcinoma - p16 positive -- very low mag.jpg|thumbnail|Histopathologic appearance of a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma specimen. Hematoxylin-eosin stain. p16 positive, EBV negative]]
Diagnosis of oral cancer is completed for (1) initial diagnosis, (2) [[Cancer staging|staging]], and (3) treatment planning. A complete history, and clinical examination is first completed, then a [[Biopsy|wedge of tissue]] is cut from the suspicious lesion for [[Histopathology|tissue diagnosis]]. This might be done with scalpel biopsy, [[Skin biopsy|punch biopsy]], [[Fine-needle aspiration|fine or core needle biopsy]]. In this procedure, the [[oral and maxillofacial surgeon|surgeon]] cuts all, or a piece of the tissue, to have it examined under a microscope by a [[pathologist]].<ref name=Gullane16>{{Cite book|title=Sataloff's Comprehensive Textbook of Otolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery: Head and Neck Surgery (Vol. 5)|last=Gullane|first=Patrick|publisher=The Health Sciences Publisher|year=2016|isbn=978-93-5152-458-8|location=New Delhi, India|pages=600}}</ref> Brush biopsies are not considered accurate for the diagnosis of oral cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = H Alsarraf A, Kujan O, Farah CS | title = The utility of oral brush cytology in the early detection of oral cancer and oral potentially malignant disorders: A systematic review | journal = Journal of Oral Pathology & Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 104–116 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29130527 | doi = 10.1111/jop.12660 | s2cid = 46832488 }}</ref>

With the first biopsy, the [[pathologist]] will  provide a [[histopathology|tissue diagnosis]] (e.g. [[squamous cell carcinoma]]), and [[Squamous cell carcinoma#Classification|classify]] the cell structure. They may add additional information that can be used in staging, and treatment planning, such as the [[Mitosis|mitotic rate]], the [[Breslow's depth|depth of invasion]], and the [[HPV]] status of the tissue.

After the tissue is confirmed cancerous, other tests will be completed to:
*better assess the size of the lesion ([[CT scan]], [[MRI]] or [[PET scan]] with [[18F-fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG)),<ref name=Gullane16/>{{rp|pages=143}} 
*look for other cancers in the upper [[aerodigestive tract]] (which may include [[endoscopy]] of the [[nasal cavity]]/[[pharynx]], [[laryngoscopy|larynx]], [[bronchoscopy|bronchus]], and [[esophagoscopy|esophagus]] called panendoscopy or quadoscopy),
*spread to the [[Cervical lymph nodes|lymph nodes]] ([[computed tomography|CT scan]]) or
*spread to [[Metastasis|other parts]] of the body ([[chest X-ray]], [[nuclear medicine]]).

Other, more invasive tests, may also be completed such as [[fine needle aspiration]], [[biopsy]] of [[lymph node]]s, and [[Sentinel lymph node|sentinel node biopsy]]. When the cancer has spread to lymph nodes, their exact location, size, and spread beyond the capsule (of the lymph nodes) needs to be determined, as each can have a significant impact on treatment and prognosis. Small differences in the pattern of lymph node spread, can have a significant impact on treatment and prognosis. Panendoscopy may be recommended, because the tissues of the entire upper [[aerodigestive tract]] are generally affected by the same [[carcinogen]]s, so other primary cancers are a common occurrence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levine B, Nielsen EW | title = The justifications and controversies of panendoscopy--a review | journal = Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal | volume = 71 | issue = 8 | pages = 335–40, 343 | date = August 1992 | pmid = 1396181 | doi = 10.1177/014556139207100802 | s2cid = 25921527 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Clayburgh DR, Brickman D | s2cid = 19124543 | title = Is esophagoscopy necessary during panendoscopy? | journal = The Laryngoscope | volume = 127 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–3 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27774605 | doi = 10.1002/lary.25532 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

From these collective findings, taken in consideration with the health and desires of the person, the cancer team develops a plan for treatment. Since most oral cancers require surgical removal, a second set of [[histopathologic]] tests will be completed on any tumor removed to determine the prognosis, need for additional surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, or other interventions.

===Classification===
Oral cancer is a subgroup of [[head and neck cancer]]s which includes those of the [[Pharynx|oropharynx]], [[larynx]], [[nasal cavity]] and [[paranasal sinuses]],  [[salivary gland]]s, and [[Thyroid|thyroid gland]]. Oral [[melanoma]], while part of head and neck cancers is considered separately.<ref name="AJCC7" /> Other cancers can occur in the mouth (such as [[Osteosarcoma|bone cancer]], [[lymphoma]], or [[Metastasis|metastatic cancers]] from distant sites) but are also considered separately from oral cancers.<ref name="AJCC7" />

===Staging===
Oral [[cancer staging]] is an assessment of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source.<ref name="Holland-Frei2">{{cite book | vauthors=Connolly JL, Goldsmith JD, Wang HH, etal | title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition=8th | chapter=37: Principles of Cancer Pathology | publisher=People's Medical Publishing House | year=2010 |isbn=978-1-60795-014-1 }}</ref> It is one of the factors affecting both the [[prognosis]] and the potential treatment of oral cancer.<ref name="Holland-Frei2" />

The evaluation of squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth and pharynx staging uses the [[TNM staging system|TNM classification]] (tumor, node, metastasis). This is based on the size of the primary tumor, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.<ref name=AJCC8th>{{cite web|title=AJCC Cancer Staging Form Supplement.

==Screening==
The [[US Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) in 2013 stated evidence was insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for oral cancer in adults without symptoms by primary care providers.<ref name=US2013Oral>{{cite web|title=Final Recommendation Statement: Oral Cancer: Screening—US Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/oral-cancer-screening1|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|access-date=23 November 2017|date=November 2013}}</ref> The [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] comes to similar conclusions while the [[American Cancer Society]] recommends that adults over 20 years who have periodic health examinations should have the oral cavity examined for cancer.<ref name=US2013Oral/> The [[American Dental Association]] recommends that providers remain alert for signs of cancer during routine examinations.<ref name=US2013Oral/>

There are a variety of screening devices, however, there is no evidence that routine use of these devices in general dental practice is helpful.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brocklehurst P, Kujan O, O'Malley LA, Ogden G, Shepherd S, Glenny AM | title = Screening programmes for the early detection and prevention of oral cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 11 | pages = CD004150 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24254989 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004150.pub4 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, there are compelling reasons to be concerned about the risk of harm this device may cause if routinely used in general practice. Such harms include false positives, unnecessary surgical biopsies and a financial burden. Micronuclei assays can help in early detection of pre-malignant and malignant lesions, thereby improving survival and reducing morbidity associated with treatment.

==Management==
[[File:Dvt rendering bionerd.gif|thumb|right|Post-operative image after removal of oral cancer with part of the [[mandible]] ([[feeding tube]] in nose)]]Oral cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) is usually treated with surgery alone, or in combination with adjunctive therapy, including radiation, with or without chemotherapy.<ref name=Gullane16/>{{rp|pages=602}} With small lesions (T1), surgery or radiation have similar control rates, so the decision about which to use is based on functional outcome, and complication rates.<ref name=Gullane16/>

===Surgery===
In most centres, removal of [[squamous cell carcinoma]] from the oral cavity and neck is achieved primarily through surgery. This also allows a detailed examination of the tissue for [[histopathologic]] characteristics, such as depth, and spread  to lymph nodes that might require radiation or chemotherapy. For small lesions (T1–2), access to the oral cavity is through the mouth. When the lesion is larger, involves the bone of the [[maxilla]] or [[mandible]], or access is limited due to mouth opening, the upper or lower lip is split, and the cheek pulled back to give greater access to the mouth.<ref name=Gullane16/> When the tumor involves the jaw bone, or when surgery or radiation will cause severe limited mouth opening, part of the bone is also removed with the tumor.

====Management of the neck====
[[File:Diagram showing the scar line after lymph node dissection in the neck CRUK 368.svg|thumb|right|Common scar line after cervical lymph node dissection]]
Spread of cancer from the oral cavity to the [[Cervical lymph nodes|lymph nodes]] of the neck has a significant effect on [[Cancer survival rates|survival]]. Between 60–70% of people with early stage oral cancer will have no lymph node involvement of the neck [[Cervical lymphadenopathy|clinically]], but 20–30% of those people (or up to 20% of all those affected) will have clinically undetectable spread of cancer to the lymph nodes of the neck (called occult disease).

The management of the neck is crucial, since spread to it reduces the chance of survival by 50%.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robbins KT, Ferlito A, Shah JP, Hamoir M, Takes RP, Strojan P, Khafif A, Silver CE, Rinaldo A, Medina JE | display-authors = 6 | title = The evolving role of selective neck dissection for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma | journal = European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology | volume = 270 | issue = 4 | pages = 1195–202 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 22903756 | doi = 10.1007/s00405-012-2153-x | s2cid = 22423135 }}</ref> If there is evidence of lymph node involvement of the neck, during the diagnostic phase, then a modified radical [[neck dissection]] is generally performed. Where the neck lymph nodes have no evidence of involvement clinically, but the oral cavity lesion is high risk for spread (e.g. T2 or above lesions), then a neck dissection of the lymph nodes above the level of the [[omohyoid muscle]] may be completed. When disease if found in the nodes after removal (but not seen clinically) the recurrence rates is 10–24%. If post-operative radiation is added, the failure rate is 0–15%. When lymph nodes are clinically found during the diagnosis phase, and radiation is added post-operative, disease control is >80%.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zelefsky MJ, Harrison LB, Fass DE, Armstrong JG, Shah JP, Strong EW | title = Postoperative radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity and oropharynx: impact of therapy on patients with positive surgical margins | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–21 | date = January 1993 | pmid = 8416876 | doi = 10.1016/0360-3016(93)90139-m }}</ref>

===Radiotherapy and chemotherapy===
[[File:Radiation (10613606134).jpg|thumb|right|Radiation treatment]]
Chemotherapy and [[radiotherapy]] are most often used, as an adjunct to surgery, to control oral cancer that is greater than stage 1, or has spread to either regional lymph nodes or other parts of the body.<ref name=Gullane16/> Radiotherapy alone can be used instead of surgery, for very small lesions, but is generally used as an adjunct when lesions are large, cannot be completely removed, or have spread to the lymph nodes of the neck. [[Chemotherapy]] is useful in oral cancers when used in combination with other treatment modalities such as radiation therapy but it is not used alone as a monotherapy. When a cure is unlikely, it can also be used to extend life and can be considered palliative but not [[curative care]].<ref name=Petrelli14>{{cite journal | vauthors = Petrelli F, Coinu A, Riboldi V, Borgonovo K, Ghilardi M, Cabiddu M, Lonati V, Sarti E, Barni S | display-authors = 6 | title = Concomitant platinum-based chemotherapy or cetuximab with radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies | journal = Oral Oncology | volume = 50 | issue = 11 | pages = 1041–8 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25176576 | doi = 10.1016/j.oraloncology.2014.08.005 }}</ref>

[[Monoclonal antibody therapy]] (with agents such as [[cetuximab]]) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of squamous cell head and neck cancers, and are likely to have an increasing role in the future management of this condition when used in conjunction with other established treatment modalities, although it is not a replacement for chemotherapy in head and neck cancers.<ref name="Chan2015" /><ref name=Petrelli14/> Likewise, molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies maybe be effective for the treatment of oral and oropharyngeal cancers. Adding epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody (EGFR mAb) to standard treatment may increase survival, keeping the cancer limited to that area of the body and may decrease reappearance of the cancer.<ref name="Chan2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan KK, Glenny AM, Weldon JC, Furness S, Worthington HV, Wakeford H | title = Interventions for the treatment of oral and oropharyngeal cancers: targeted therapy and immunotherapy | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD010341 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26625332 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010341.pub2 }}</ref>

===Rehabilitation===
Following treatment, [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] may be necessary to improve movement, chewing, swallowing, and speech. [[Speech and language pathology|Speech and language pathologist]]s may be involved at this stage. Treatment of oral cancer will usually be by a multidisciplinary team, with treatment professionals from the realms of radiation, surgery, chemotherapy, nutrition, dentistry, and even psychology all possibly involved with diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and care. Due to the location of oral cancer, there may be a period where the person requires a [[tracheotomy]] and [[feeding tube]].

==Prognosis==
Survival rates for oral cancer depend on the precise site and the stage of the cancer at diagnosis. Overall, 2011 data from the SEER database shows that survival is around 57% at five years when all stages of initial diagnosis, all genders, all ethnicities, all age groups, and all treatment modalities are considered. Survival rates for stage 1 cancers are approximately 90%, hence the emphasis on early detection to increase survival outcome for people. Similar survival rates are reported from other countries such as Germany.<ref name="Listl2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Listl S, Jansen L, Stenzinger A, Freier K, Emrich K, Holleczek B, Katalinic A, Gondos A, Brenner H | display-authors = 6 | title = Survival of patients with oral cavity cancer in Germany | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = e53415 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23349710 | pmc = 3548847 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0053415 | editor1-last = Scheurer | author10 = GEKID Cancer Survival Working Group | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...853415L | editor1-first = Michael }}</ref>

===Europe===
Europe places second-highest after Southeast Asia among all continents for age-standardised rate (ASR) specific to oral and oropharyngeal cancer. It is estimated that there were 61,400 cases of oral and lip cancer within Europe in 2012. Hungary recorded the highest number of mortality and morbidity due to oral and pharyngeal cancer among all European countries while Cyprus reported the lowest numbers&nbsp;<ref name=":6">{{cite journal|title=Cancer of lip, oral cavity and pharynx.

====United Kingdom====
British Cancer Research found 2,386 deaths due to oral cancer in 2014; other studies show this is particularly within the elder population category; only 6% of people affected by oral cancer are under 45.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=oral cancer statistics|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/oral-cancer|website=CancerresearchUK|access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref> The UK is 16th-lowest for males and 11th-highest for females for oral cancer incidence among Europe. Additionally, there is a regional variability within the UK, with Scotland and northern England having higher rates than southern England. The same analysis applies to lifetime risk of developing oral cancer, as in Scotland it is 1.84% in males and 0.74% in females, higher than the rest of the UK, being 1.06% and 0.48%, respectively.

Oral cancer is the sixteenth most common cancer in the UK (around 6,800 people were diagnosed with oral cancer in the UK in 2011), and it is the nineteenth-most -common cause of cancer death (around 2,100 people died from the disease in 2012).<ref name=":0"/>

====Northern Europe====
The highest incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancer was recorded in Denmark, with age-standardised rates per 100,000 of 13.0, followed by Lithuania (9.9) and the United Kingdom (9.8).<ref name=":6" /> Lithuania reported the highest incidence in men while Denmark reported the highest in women. The highest rates for mortality in 2012 were reported in Lithuania (7.5), Estonia (6.0), and Latvia (5.4).<ref name=":6" /> The high incidence rate of oral and pharyngeal cancer in Denmark could be attributed to their higher alcohol intake than citizens of other Scandinavian countries and low intake of fruits and vegetables in general.

====Eastern Europe====
Hungary (23.3), Slovakia (16.4), and Romania (15.5) reported the highest incidences of oral and pharyngeal cancer.<ref name=":6" /> Hungary also recorded the highest incidence in both genders as well as the highest mortality rates in Europe.<ref name=":6" /> It is ranked third globally for cancer mortality rates.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal|title=World Life Expectancy|date=2014|url=http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com}}</ref> Cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, inequalities in the care received by people with cancer, and gender-specific systemic risk factors have been determined as the leading causes for the high morbidity and mortality rates in Hungary.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal|vauthors=Diz P, Meleti M, Diniz-Freitas M, Vescovi P, Warnakulasuriya S, Johnson N, Kerr A |title=Oral and pharyngeal cancer in Europe|journal=Translational Research in Oral Oncology|date=2017|volume=2|pages=2057178X1770151|doi=10.1177/2057178X17701517|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nemes JA, Redl P, Boda R, Kiss C, Márton IJ | title = Oral cancer report from Northeastern Hungary | journal = Pathology Oncology Research | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–92 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18351444 | doi = 10.1007/s12253-008-9021-4 | s2cid = 1187249 | display-authors = etal }}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite journal|vauthors=Suba Z, Mihályi S, Takács D, Gyulai-Gaál S |title=Oral cancer: Morbus hungaricus in the 21st century|journal=Fogorv Sz|date=2009|volume=102|issue=2|pages=63–68|pmid=19514245}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite journal|vauthors=Endre A|title=Hungarian national cancer control programme|date=2006}}</ref>

====Western Europe====
The incidence rates of oral cancer in western Europe found France, Germany and Belgium to be highest. The ASRs (per 100,000) were 15.0, 14.6, and 14.1, respectively. When filtered by gender category, the same countries rank top 3 for male, however, in different order of Belgium (21.9), Germany (23.1), and France (23.1). France, Belgium, and the Netherlands ranks highest for females, with ASRs 7.6, 7.0, and 7.0, respectively.<ref name=":6" />

====Southern Europe ====
Incidence of oral and oropharyngeal cancers were recorded, finding Portugal, Croatia and Serbia to have highest rates (ASR per 100,000). These values are 15.4, 12, and 11.7, respectively.

===United States===
In 2011, close to 37,000 Americans are projected to be diagnosed with oral or pharyngeal cancer. 66% of the time, these will be found as late stage three and four disease. It will cause over 8,000 deaths. Of those newly diagnosed, only slightly more than half will be alive in five years. Similar survival estimates are reported from other countries. For example, five-year relative survival for oral cavity cancer in Germany is about 55%.<ref name="Listl2013" /> In the US oral cancer accounts for about 8 percent of all malignant growths.

Oral cancers overall risk higher in black males opposed to white males, however specific oral cancers-such as of the lip, have a higher risk in white males opposed to black males. Overall, rates of oral cancer between gender groups (male and female) seem to be decreasing, according to data from 3 studies.<ref name=":13">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore SR, Johnson NW, Pierce AM, Wilson DF | title = The epidemiology of mouth cancer: a review of global incidence | journal = Oral Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 65–74 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10702782 | doi = 10.1111/j.1601-0825.2000.tb00104.x }}</ref>

Of all the cancers, oral cancer attributes to 3% in males, opposed to 2% in women. New cases of oral cancer in US as of 2013, approximated almost 66,000 with almost 14000 attributed from tongue cancer, and nearly 12000 from the mouth, and the remainder from the oral cavity and pharynx. In the previous year, 1.6% of lip and oral cavity cancers were diagnosed, where the age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) across all geographic regions of United States of America estimates at 5.2 per 100,000 population.<ref name=":14">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta N, Gupta R, Acharya AK, Patthi B, Goud V, Reddy S, Garg A, Singla A | display-authors = 6 | title = Changing Trends in oral cancer - a global scenario | journal = Nepal Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 613–619 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 28804673 | pmc = 5506386 | doi = 10.3126/nje.v6i4.17255 }}</ref> It is the eleventh-most-common cancer in the United States among males while in Canada and Mexico it is the twelfth and thirteenth-most-common cancer respectively. The ASIR for lip and oral cavity cancer among men in Canada and Mexico is 4.2 and 3.1, respectively.<ref name=":14" />

===South America===
The ASIR across all geographic regions of South America as of 2012 sits at 3.8 per 100,000 population where approximately 6,046 deaths have occurred due to lip and oral cavity cancer, where the age-standardized mortality rate remains at 1.4.<ref name=":15">{{cite news|title=Cancer Facts & Figures 2017|url=https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/cancer-facts-figures-2017.html|publisher=America cancer society}}</ref>

In Brazil, however, lip and oral cavity cancer is the 7th most common cancer, with an estimated 6,930 new cases diagnosed in the year 2012. This number is rising and has an overall higher ASIR at 7.2 per 100,000 population whereby an approx 3000 deaths have occurred <ref name=":15" />

Rates are increasing across both males and females. As of 2017, almost 50000 new cases of oropharyngeal cancers will be diagnosed, with incidence rates being more than twice as high in men than women.<ref name=":15" />

===Asia===
Oral cancer is one of the most-common types of cancer in Asia due to its association with smoking (tobacco, bidi), betel quid and alcohol consumption. Regionally incidence varies with highest rates in South Asia, particularly Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Philippines, and Sri Lanka.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalanon J, Esguerra R, Diano LM, Matsuka Y | title = Analysis of the Filipinos' Interest in Searching Online for Oral Cancer | journal = Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 1121–1127 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 32334480 | doi = 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.4.1121 | pmc = 7445963 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=":9">{{cite journal | vauthors = Krishna Rao SV, Mejia G, Roberts-Thomson K, Logan R | title = Epidemiology of oral cancer in Asia in the past decade--an update (2000-2012) | journal = Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 5567–77 | date = 30 October 2013 | pmid = 24289546 | doi = 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.10.5567 | publisher = Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention | doi-access = free }}</ref> In South East Asia and Arab countries, although the prevalence is not as high, estimated incidences of oral cancer ranged from 1.6 to 8.6/ 100,000 and 1.8 to 2.13/ 100,000 respectively.<ref name=":8">{{cite journal|last1=Cheong|first1=Sok Ching|last2=Vatanasapt|first2=Patravoot|last3=Yi-Hsin|first3=Yang|last4=Zain|first4=Rosnah B|last5=Kerr|first5=Alexander Ross|last6=Johnson|first6=Newell W|title=Oral cancer in South East Asia|journal=Translational Research in Oral Oncology|volume=2|year=2017|pages=2057178X1770292|issn=2057-178X|doi=10.1177/2057178X17702921|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Jaber A, Al-Nasser L, El-Metwally A | title = Epidemiology of oral cancer in Arab countries | journal = Saudi Medical Journal | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–55 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26905345 | pmc = 4800887 | doi = 10.15537/smj.2016.3.11388 }}</ref> According to GLOBOCAN 2012, the estimated age-standardised rates of cancer incidence and mortality was higher in males than females.

====India====
Oral cancer is the third-most-common form of cancer in India with over 77 000 new cases diagnosed in 2012 (2.3:1 male to female ratio).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mallath MK, Taylor DG, Badwe RA, Rath GK, Shanta V, Pramesh CS, Digumarti R, Sebastian P, Borthakur BB, Kalwar A, Kapoor S, Kumar S, Gill JL, Kuriakose MA, Malhotra H, Sharma SC, Shukla S, Viswanath L, Chacko RT, Pautu JL, Reddy KS, Sharma KS, Purushotham AD, Sullivan R | display-authors = 6 | title = The growing burden of cancer in India: epidemiology and social context | journal = The Lancet.

===Africa===
There is limited data for the prevalence of oral cancer in Africa. The following rates describe the number of new cases (for incidence rates) or deaths (for mortality rates) per 100 000 individuals per year.<ref name=":10" />

The incidence rate of oral cancer is 2.6 for both sexes. The rate is higher in males at 3.3 and lower in females at 2.0.<ref name=":10" />

The mortality rate is lower than the incidence rate at 1.6 for both sexes. The rate is again higher for males at 2.1 and lower for females at 1.3.<ref name=":10" />

===Australia===
The following rates describe the number of new cases or deaths per 100 000 individuals per year. The incidence rate of oral cancer is 6.3 for both sexes; this is higher in males at 6.8–8.8 and lower in females at 3.7–3.9.<ref name=":11">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaturvedi AK, Anderson WF, Lortet-Tieulent J, Curado MP, Ferlay J, Franceschi S, Rosenberg PS, Bray F, Gillison ML | display-authors = 6 | title = Worldwide trends in incidence rates for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 31 | issue = 36 | pages = 4550–9 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24248688 | pmc = 3865341 | doi = 10.1200/jco.2013.50.3870 }}</ref> The mortality rate is significantly lower than the incidence rate at 1.0 for both sexes.

The location ‘other mouth’ refers to the buccal mucosa, the vestibule and other unspecified parts of the mouth. The data suggests lip cancer has the highest incidence rate while gingival cancer has the lowest rate overall. In terms of mortality rates, oropharyngeal cancer has the highest rate in males and tongue cancer has the highest rate in females. Lip, palatal and gingival cancer have the lowest mortality rates overall.<ref name=":12" />
