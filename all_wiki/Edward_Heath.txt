'''Sir Edward Richard George Heath''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100|sep=,|KG|MBE}} (9 July 1916{{spnd}}17 July 2005), often known as '''Ted Heath''', was a British politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1974 and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1965 to 1975. Heath served 51 years as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] from 1950 to 2001. He was a strong supporter of the [[European Communities]] (EC), and after winning the decisive vote in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by 356 to 244,<ref>{{cite web |title=EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES (Hansard, 28 October 1971) |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1971/oct/28/european-communities |website=api.parliament.uk |accessdate=3 June 2020}}</ref> he led the negotiations that culminated in [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|Britain's entry into the EC on 1 January 1973]]. It was, according to biographer [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]], "Heath's finest hour".<ref>John Campbell, ''Edward Heath'' (1993) pp. 404–405.</ref> Although Heath planned to be an innovator as Prime Minister, his government foundered on economic difficulties, including high inflation and major strikes. He became an embittered critic of [[Margaret Thatcher]], who supplanted him as party leader.

Born the child of a carpenter and a maid, Heath was educated at a grammar school and became a leader in student politics at the [[University of Oxford]]. He served as an officer in the [[Royal Artillery]] during the Second World War. He worked briefly in the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-33772016 |title=Edward Heath: A profile of the former UK Prime Minister |date=4 August 2015 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref> but resigned in order to stand for Parliament, and was elected for [[Bexley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bexley]] in the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]]. He was the [[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party|Chief Whip]] from 1955 to 1959. Having entered the Cabinet as [[Minister of Labour]] in 1959, he was promoted to [[Lord Privy Seal]] and later became [[President of the Board of Trade]]. Heath was [[1965 Conservative Party leadership election|elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1965]]; he retained that position despite losing the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]]. Heath became Prime Minister after winning the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]]. In 1971 he oversaw the [[Decimal Day|decimalisation of British coinage]], and in 1972 he reformed Britain's system of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]], reducing the number of local authorities and creating a number of new metropolitan counties. In 1973 he led the United Kingdom into the [[European Communities]] (which would later become the [[European Union]]) as a [[Member state of the European Union|member state]]. This was later endorsed by the British people, two and half years later, in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|referendum on continued membership]], the first ever national referendum in the United Kingdom, in which he played a modest role in helping the "Yes" vote to win.

Heath's premiership also coincided with the height of [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], with his approval of [[Operation Demetrius| internment without trial]] and subsequent suspension of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont Parliament]] and the imposition of direct British rule. Unofficial talks with [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] delegates were unsuccessful, as was the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973, which led the MPs of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] to withdraw from the Conservative whip. Heath also tried to curb the trade unions with the [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], and hoped to deregulate the economy and make a transfer from [[Direct tax|direct]] to [[indirect tax]]ation. Rising unemployment in 1972 led him to reflate the economy; he attempted to control the resulting high inflation by a prices and [[incomes policy]]. Two miners' strikes, in 1972 and at the start of 1974, damaged the government; the latter caused the implementation of the [[Three-Day Week]] to conserve energy. Heath eventually called an [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|election for February 1974]] to obtain a mandate to face down the miners' wage demands, but this instead resulted in a [[hung parliament]] as the Conservative Party lost their working majority. The opposition Labour Party, despite gaining fewer votes, held four more seats. Heath resigned as Prime Minister after talks with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to form a coalition government were unsuccessful. Despite losing a [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|second general election in October 1974]], he vowed to continue as party leader. In February 1975, Margaret Thatcher [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|challenged and defeated him]] to win the leadership.

Returning to the backbenches, Heath was openly critical of [[Thatcherism]]. He remained a backbench MP until retiring at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 election]], serving as the [[Father of the House (United Kingdom)|Father of the House]] for his last nine years in Parliament. Outside politics, Heath was a world-class yachtsman and a talented musician. He died in 2005, aged 89. He is one of four British prime ministers never to have married. Heath's origins were also unusual for a Conservative leader when he was elected. In 2015, the BBC described Heath as "the first working-class meritocrat" to become Conservative leader in "the party's modern history" and "a [[One-nation conservatism|'One Nation' Tory]] in the [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] tradition who rejected the laissez-faire capitalism that Baroness Thatcher would enthusiastically endorse."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33958116 |title=Sir Edward Heath: One Nation Tory's political legacy |work=BBC News |first=Julia |last=Langdon |date=1 October 2015 |accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref>

==Early life==
Edward Heath was born at 54 Albion Road, Broadstairs, Kent on 9 July 1916, the son of William George Heath (1888–1976), a carpenter who built air frames for [[Vickers Limited|Vickers]] during the First World War, and was subsequently employed as a builder<ref name="Britain, Arthur Marwick 1996, p. 158">British Society Since 1945: The Penguin Social History of Britain, [[Arthur Marwick]], Penguin Books, 1996, p. 158</ref> and Edith Anne Heath (''née'' Pantony; 1888–1951), a maid. His father was later a successful small businessman after taking over a building and decorating firm. Heath's paternal grandfather had run a small dairy business, and when that failed worked as a porter at Broadstairs Station on the Southern Railway.<ref name="Britain, Arthur Marwick 1996, p. 158"/> Edward was four years old when his younger brother, John, was born; there was no question that Edward was the "favoured brother."<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Campbell |title=Edward Heath |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I7wqAQAAMAAJ |publisher=Pimlico |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-7126-5898-0 |page=7}}</ref> Heath was known as "Teddy" as a young man.<ref>{{cite book |author=John Campbell|title=Edward Heath: A Biography |year=2013 |page=5 |isbn=978-1-84595-205-1}}</ref> He was educated at [[Chatham House Grammar School]] in [[Ramsgate]], and in 1935 with the aid of a county scholarship he went up to study at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].<ref>Ziegler, ''Edward Heath'' (2010) ch. 1</ref>

In later years, Heath's peculiar accent, with its "strangulated" vowel sounds, combined with his non-Standard pronunciation of "l" as "w" and "out" as "eout", was satirised by [[Monty Python]] in the audio sketch "[[Teach Yourself Heath]]" (released on a 7" flexi-disc single included with initial copies of their 1972 LP ''[[Monty Python's Previous Record]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZByWk6SPM0 |title=Learn How To Speak Propah English&nbsp;– Ted Heath &#124; Teach Yourself Heath |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> Heath's biographer [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] speculates that his speech, unlike that of his father and younger brother, who both spoke with Kent accents, must have undergone "drastic alteration on encountering Oxford", although retaining elements of Kent speech.

==Oxford==
A talented musician, Heath won the college's [[organ scholar]]ship in his first term (he had previously tried for the organ scholarships at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]], and [[Keble College, Oxford]]) which enabled him to stay at the university for a fourth year; he eventually graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|Second Class Honours]] BA in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] in 1939.

While at university Heath became active in Conservative Party politics. On the key political issue of the day, foreign policy, he opposed the Conservative-dominated government of the day ever more openly. His first Paper Speech (i.e. a major speech listed on the [[Order Paper]] along with the visiting guest speakers) at the [[Oxford Union]], in 1936, was in opposition to the [[appeasement]] of Germany by returning her colonies, confiscated during the First World War.

In June 1937 he was elected President of the [[Oxford University Conservative Association]] as a pro-[[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] candidate, in opposition to the pro-[[Francisco Franco|Franco]] [[John Stokes (Conservative politician)|John Stokes]] (himself later a Conservative MP). In 1937–38 Heath was chairman of the national [[Federation of University Conservative Associations]], and in the same year (his third at university) he was Secretary and then Librarian of the Oxford Union. At the end of the year he was defeated for the Presidency of the Oxford Union by another Balliol candidate, Alan Wood, on the issue of whether the [[Chamberlain war ministry|Chamberlain government]] should give way to a left-wing [[Popular Front (UK)|Popular Front]]. On that occasion Heath supported the government.<ref>Ziegler, ''Edward Heath'' (2010) ch. 2</ref>

In his final year Heath was President of Balliol College [[Junior Common Room]], an office held in subsequent years by his near-contemporaries [[Denis Healey]] and [[Roy Jenkins]], and as such was invited to support the Master of Balliol [[Sandie Lindsay, 1st Baron Lindsay of Birker|Alexander Lindsay]], who stood as an anti-appeasement 'Independent Progressive' candidate against the official Conservative candidate, [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], in the [[1938 Oxford by-election]].

Heath, who had himself applied to be the Conservative candidate for the by-election,<ref>Heath, Edward. ''The Course of My Life''. London: [[Hodder & Stoughton]], 1998, p. 58</ref> accused the government in an October Union Debate of "turning all four cheeks" to [[Adolf Hitler]], and was elected as [[list of Presidents of the Oxford Union|President of the Oxford Union]] in November 1938, sponsored by Balliol, after winning the Presidential Debate that "This House has No Confidence in the National Government as presently constituted". He was thus President in [[Hilary term]] 1939; the visiting [[Leo Amery]] described him in his diaries as "a pleasant youth".

As an undergraduate, Heath travelled widely in Europe. His opposition to appeasement was nourished by his witnessing first-hand a [[Nuremberg Rally]] in 1937, where he met leading Nazis [[Hermann Göring]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], and [[Heinrich Himmler]] at an [[SS]] cocktail party. He later described Himmler as "the most evil man I have ever met".<ref>{{cite web |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 18 July 2005 (pt. 6 |year=2005 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050718/debtext/50718-06.htm |accessdate=30 March 2009}}</ref> He was in Germany for two months to learn German, but did not keep up any fluency in the language in later life.<ref>Ziegler 2010, pp. 31</ref> In 1938 he visited [[Barcelona]], then under attack from Spanish Nationalist forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. On one occasion a car in which he was travelling came under machine-gun fire, while on another a bomb hit his hotel whilst he was observing an air raid from outside.<ref>Ziegler 2010, pp. 30 Ziegler notes that the claim in his memoirs that the bomb killed those who had taken shelter does not tally with an earlier account in which he stated that nobody was hurt, and suggests that the story may have grown a little in the telling.</ref> In the summer of 1939, accompanied by his Jewish friend [[Madron Seligman]], he travelled to [[Danzig]] and [[Poland]]. They made the return journey by hitchhiking and rail across Germany through mobilising troops, returning to Britain just before the declaration of war.<ref>Ziegler 2010, pp. 31–2</ref>

==Second World War==
Heath spent late 1939 and early 1940 on a debating tour of the United States before being called up. On 22 March 1941, he received an emergency commission as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Artillery]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35133 |supp=y |page=2100 |date=8 April 1941}}</ref> During the war he initially served with heavy anti-aircraft guns around [[Liverpool]] (which suffered [[May Blitz, Liverpool|heavy German bombing]] in May 1941) and by early 1942 was regimental [[adjutant]], with the war substantive rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].<ref name="auto">Ziegler, ''Edward Heath'' (2010) ch. 3</ref><ref name="auto1">{{London Gazette |issue=37340 |supp=y |page=5437 |date=6 November 1945}}</ref>

Heath participated as an adjutant in the [[Normandy landings]], where he met [[Maurice Schumann]], French Foreign Minister under [[Georges Pompidou|Pompidou]].<ref>Heath, Edward. ''The Course of My Life''. p. 390</ref> As a temporary major commanding a battery of his own, he provided artillery support during the Allied campaigns in France and Germany in 1944–45, for which he received a [[mention in despatches]] on 8 November 1945.<ref name="auto1"/><ref name="auto"/>

Heath later remarked that, although he did not personally kill anybody, as the British forces advanced he saw the devastation caused by his unit's artillery bombardments. In September 1945 he commanded a firing squad that executed a Polish soldier convicted of rape and murder. He was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]], Military Division (MBE) on 24 January 1946.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37442 |supp=y |page=621 |date=22 January 1946}}</ref> He was demobilised in August 1946 and promoted to the substantive rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]] on 1 May 1947.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38006 |supp=y |page=3065 |date=1 July 1947}}</ref>

Heath joined the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] as a lieutenant-colonel on 1 September 1951,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=39334 |supp=y |page=4872 |date=14 September 1951}}</ref> in which he remained active throughout the 1950s, rising to commanding officer of the Second Battalion; a portrait of him in full dress uniform still hangs in the HAC's Long Room. In April 1971, as Prime Minister, he wore his lieutenant-colonel's insignia to inspect troops.<ref>{{cite book |author=Staff |title=A History of Our Reserves |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/283812/a-history-our-Reserves-Epub-v2.pdf |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] |page=31 |year=2014}}</ref>

==Post-war, 1945–1950==
Before the war Heath had won a scholarship to [[Gray's Inn]] and had begun making preparations for a career at the Bar, but after the war he was placed in joint top position in the [[civil service examination]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1494246/Sir-Edward-Heath.html |title=Sir Edward Heath obituary |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=18 July 2005 |location=London}}</ref> He then became a civil servant in the Ministry of Civil Aviation (he was disappointed not to be posted to the Treasury, but declined an offer to join the Foreign Office, fearing that foreign postings might prevent him from entering politics).<ref>Heath, Edward. ''The Course of My Life''. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1998, p. 111</ref>

Heath joined a team under [[Alison Munro]] tasked with drawing up a scheme for British airports using some of the many Second World War [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] bases, and was specifically charged with planning the home counties. Years later she attributed his evident enthusiasm for Maplin Airport to this work. Then much to the surprise of civil service colleagues, he sought adoption as the prospective parliamentary candidate for [[Bexley]] and resigned in November 1947.

After working as news editor of the ''[[Church Times]]'' from February 1948 to September 1949,<ref>Palmer, Bernard ''Gadfly for God'' London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1991 p. 197<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Heath worked as a management trainee at the [[merchant bank]]ers [[Brown, Shipley & Co.]] until his election as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Bexley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bexley]] in the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|February 1950 general election]]. In the election he defeated an old contemporary from the Oxford Union, [[Ashley Bramall]], by a margin of 133 votes.

==Member of Parliament (1950–1965)==
[[File:Sir Edward Heath.jpg|thumb|Heath in 1960]]
Heath made his [[maiden speech]] in the House of Commons on 26 June 1950, in which he appealed to the Labour government to participate in the [[Schuman Plan]]. As MP for Bexley, he gave enthusiastic speeches in support of the young candidate for neighbouring [[Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)|Dartford]], Margaret Roberts, later [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>Ziegler, ''Edward Heath'' (2010) ch. 5</ref>

He was appointed as an [[Whip (politics)|opposition whip]] by [[Winston Churchill]] in February 1951. He remained in the whips' office after the Conservatives won the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], rising rapidly to Joint Deputy Chief Whip, Deputy Chief Whip and, in December 1955, [[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party|Government Chief Whip]] under [[Anthony Eden]]. Journalist [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]] has observed that "Of all government jobs, this requires firmness and fairness allied to tact and patience and Heath's ascent seems baffling in hindsight".<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/><ref>Ziegler, ''Edward Heath'' (2010) ch. 6</ref>

Due to the convention that whips do not speak in Parliament, Heath managed to keep out of the controversy over the [[Suez Crisis]]. On the announcement of Eden's resignation, Heath submitted a report on the opinions of the Conservative MPs regarding Eden's possible successors. This report favoured [[Harold Macmillan]] and helped to secure Macmillan the premiership in January 1957. Macmillan later appointed Heath Minister of Labour, a Cabinet Minister—as Chief Whip Heath had attended Cabinet, but had not been formally a member—after winning the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|October 1959 election]].

In 1960 Macmillan appointed Heath [[Lord Privy Seal]] with responsibility for the negotiations to secure the UK's first attempt to join the [[European Communities]] (or [[Common Market]], as it was then more widely known). After extensive negotiations, involving detailed agreements about the UK's agricultural trade with [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[New Zealand]], British entry was vetoed by the French President, [[Charles de Gaulle]], at a press conference in January 1963 – much to the disappointment of Heath, who was a firm supporter of European common market membership for the United Kingdom. He oversaw a successful application when serving in a higher position a decade later.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/heath_edward.shtml Historic Figures: Edward Heath (1916–2005)], BBC. Retrieved 21 June 2015.</ref><ref>Ziegler, ''Edward Heath'' (2010) ch. 7</ref>

After this setback, a major humiliation for Macmillan's foreign policy, Heath was not a contender for the party leadership on Macmillan's retirement in October 1963. Under Prime Minister [[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] he was [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|President of the Board of Trade]] and Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development, and oversaw the abolition of [[retail price maintenance]].

==Leader of the Opposition (1965–1970)==

After the Conservative Party lost the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1964]], the defeated Home changed the party leadership rules to allow for a ballot by MPs, and then resigned. The following year, Heath—who was [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer|Shadow Chancellor]] at the time, and had recently won favourable publicity for leading the fight against Labour's [[Finance Bill]]—unexpectedly won the [[1965 Conservative Party leadership election|party's leadership contest]], gaining 150 votes to [[Reginald Maudling]]'s 133 and [[Enoch Powell]]'s 15.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/27/newsid_2956000/2956082.stm |title=Heath is new Tory leader |work=BBC News |date=27 July 1996 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> Heath became the Conservatives' youngest leader and retained office after the party's defeat in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1966]].

In April 1968, Enoch Powell made his controversial [[Rivers of Blood speech|"Rivers of Blood" speech]], which criticised [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration to the United Kingdom]]. Soon afterwards, Heath telephoned [[Margaret Thatcher]] to inform her that he was going to sack Powell from the [[Shadow Cabinet]]; she recalled that she "really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis". The next day, Heath sacked Powell. Several Conservatives on the right protested against Powell's sacking.<ref>{{cite book |title=Like the Roman: The Life of Enoch Powell |last=Heffer |first=Simon |year=1999 |page=466}}</ref> According to Heath, he never spoke to Powell again.<ref>Heath, Edward.

=== 1970 election ===
With another general election approaching in 1970 a Conservative policy document emerged from the [[Selsdon Park Hotel]] that offered free-market oriented policies as solutions to the country's unemployment and inflation problems.<ref name="ReferenceA">Young, Hugo. ''One Of Us'' London: MacMillan, 1989</ref> Heath stated that the Selsdon weekend only reaffirmed policies that had actually been evolving since he became leader of the Conservative Party. The Labour prime minister, [[Harold Wilson]], thought the document a vote-loser and dubbed it the product of ''Selsdon Man'' – after the supposedly prehistoric ''[[Piltdown Man]]''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Jonathan|title=Dictionary of Jargon|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1987|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofjarg00jona/page/482 482]|isbn=978-0-7100-9919-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofjarg00jona/page/482}}</ref> – to portray it as reactionary. Heath's Conservative Party won the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1970]] with 330 seats to Labour's 287. The new cabinet included [[Margaret Thatcher]] (Education and Science), [[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|William Whitelaw]] (Leader of the House of Commons) and the former prime minister Alec Douglas-Home (Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs).<ref>Ziegler, ''Edward Heath'' (2010) ch. 12</ref>

===Welfare state===
During Heath's first year in office, higher charges were introduced for benefits of the welfare state such as school meals, spectacles, dentistry, and prescriptions. Entitlement to [[Social security|State Sickness Benefit]] was also changed so that it would only be paid after the first three days of sickness.<ref name="ReferenceB">The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State by Nicholas Timmins</ref> As a result of the squeeze in the education budget, Thatcher ended the provision of [[Education Act 1944#School milk|free school milk]] for 8- to 11-year-olds (it had already been ended for older children by Harold Wilson); the tabloid press christened her "Margaret Thatcher: Milk Snatcher", although Wilson, a Labour prime minister, had received no such criticism.<ref>Smith, Rebecca (8 August 2010). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/7932963/How-Margaret-Thatcher-became-known-as-Milk-Snatcher.html "How Margaret Thatcher became known as 'Milk Snatcher{{'"}}.] ''The Daily Telegraph''. London.</ref> Despite these measures, the Heath government encouraged a significant increase in welfare spending, and Thatcher blocked Macleod's other posthumous education policy: the abolition of the [[Open University]], which had recently been founded by the preceding Labour government.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The chancellors: a history of the chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945–90'' (1997) pp. 389–399.</ref>

Provision was made under the 1970 National Insurance (Old Persons' and Widows' Pensions and Attendances Allowances) Act for pensions to be paid to old people who had been excluded from the pre-1948 pension schemes and were accordingly excluded from the comprehensive scheme that was introduced in 1948. About 100,000 people were affected by this change, half of whom were receiving [[Supplementary Benefit]] under the social security scheme. The Act also made improvements to the Widow's Pension scheme by introducing a scale that started at 30 shillings a week for women widowed at the age of 40 and rose to the full rate of £5 at the age of 50.<ref>''Britannica Book of the Year 1971'', (Encyclopædia Britannica, 1972)</ref>

Considerable support was provided for nursery school building, and a long-term capital investment programme in school building was launched. A [[Family Fund]] was set up to provide assistance to families with children who had congenital conditions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familyfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/Brief%20history%20of%20the%20Family%20Fund.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511115347/http://www.familyfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/Brief%20history%20of%20the%20Family%20Fund.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 May 2013|title=Family Fund&nbsp;– Home|publisher=familyfund.org.uk}}</ref> while new benefits were introduced benefiting hundreds of thousands of disabled persons whose disabilities had been caused neither by war nor by industrial injury. An [[Attendance Allowance]] was introduced for those needing care at home, together with [[Invalidity Benefit]] for the long-term sick, while a higher Child Allowance was made available where invalidity allowance was paid. Widow's Benefits were introduced for those aged between forty and fifty years of age, improved subsidies for [[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|slum clearance]] were made available, while Rent Allowances were introduced for private tenants.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> In April 1971, the right to education was given to all children with Down's syndrome for the first time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lorenz|first1=Stephanie|title=Children with Down's Syndrome: A Guide for Teachers and Support Assistants in Mainstream Education|date=1998|publisher=David Fulton|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aY5tZP4c5uwC&pg=PA7|isbn=978-1-136-61241-1}}</ref>

The school leaving age was raised to 16,<ref>Sally Tomlinson, ''Education in a post-welfare society'' (2005) p 24</ref> while [[Family Income Supplement]] was introduced to boost the incomes of low-income earners.<ref>John Dixon and Robert P. Scheurell, ''The state of social welfare: The Twentieth Century in cross-national review'' (2002) pp. 97–98.</ref>

Families who received this benefit were exempted from [[Prescription charges|NHS charges]] while the children in such families were eligible for [[School meal#United Kingdom|free school meal]]s. [[Social pension|Non-contributory pensions]] were also introduced for all persons aged eighty and above,<ref>Poverty, inequality and health in Britain, 1800–2000: a reader edited by George Davey Smith, Daniel Dorling, and Mary Shaw</ref> while the Social Security Act 1973 was passed which introduced benefit indexation in the United Kingdom for the first time by index-linking benefits to prices to maintain their real value.<ref>Michael James Hill, ''Understanding Social Policy''</ref>

===Scottish nationalism===
[[Scottish National Party|Scottish nationalism]] grew as a political force, while the [[Decimal Day|decimalisation of British coinage]], begun under the previous Labour government, was completed eight months after Heath came to power. The [[Central Policy Review Staff]] was established by Heath in February 1971,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Greenwood|first1=John R.|last2=Wilson|first2= David Jack|title=Public administration in Britain today|publisher=Routledge|year=1989|page=58|isbn=978-0-04-445195-2}}</ref> while the [[Local Government Act 1972]] changed the boundaries of the counties of England and Wales and created Metropolitan Counties around the major cities (e.g. Merseyside around Liverpool): this caused significant public anger. Heath did not divide England into regions, choosing instead to await the report of the [[Crowther Commission]] on the constitution; the 10 [[Regions of England|Government Office Regions]] were eventually set up by the Major government in 1994.

===Economic policy===
Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Iain Macleod]] died and was replaced on 20 July 1970 by [[Anthony Barber]]. Heath's planned economic policy changes (including a significant shift from direct to indirect taxation) remained largely unimplemented: the Selsdon policy document was more or less abandoned as unemployment increased considerably by 1972. By January that year, the number of unemployed reached a million, the highest level for more than two decades. Opposed to unemployment on moral grounds, Heath encouraged a famous "U-Turn" in economic policy that precipitated what became known as the "Barber boom". This was a two-range process involving the budgets of 1972 and 1973, the former of which pumped £2.5&nbsp;billion into the economy in increased pensions and benefits and tax reductions. By early 1974, as a result of this Keynesian economic strategy, unemployment had fallen to under 550,000. The economic boom did not last, and the Heath government implemented various cuts that led to the abandonment of policy goals such as a planned expansion of nursery education.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===Trade unions===
Much of the government's attention, as well as the media and public opinion, focused on deteriorating labour relations, as the government sought to weaken the economic power of the trade unions, which had grown steadily since 1945.   The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]] set up a special court under the judge [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Lord Donaldson]]. Its imprisonment of striking dockworkers was a public relations disaster and became an object lesson for the Thatcher government of the 1980s. Thatcher relied instead on confiscating the assets of unions that courts found to have violated anti-strike laws.

The trade unions responded with a full-scale counterattack on a government hobbled by inflation and high unemployment. Especially damaging to the government's credibility were the two miners' strikes of 1972 and 1974, the latter of which resulted in much of the country's industry working a [[Three-Day Week]] in an attempt to conserve energy. The [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] won its case but the energy shortages and the resulting breakdown of domestic consensus contributed to the eventual downfall of his government.

===Unemployment===
There was a steep rise in unemployment for the first two years of the Heath ministry, but it was then reversed. Labour in 1964 had inherited an unemployment count of around 400,000, but saw unemployment peak at 631,000 in early 1967. At election time June 1970, the unemployment numbers were still high at 582,000. Heath and the Conservatives were pledged to "full employment" but within a year it became clear that they were losing that battle, as the official unemployment count crept towards 1,000,000 and some newspapers suggested that it was even higher. In January 1972 it was officially confirmed that unemployment had risen above 1,000,000 – a level not seen for more than 30 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/20/newsid_2506000/2506897.stm |title=UK unemployment tops one million |work=BBC News |date=20 January 1972 |accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> Various other reports around this time suggested that unemployment was higher still, with ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper claiming that "nearly 3,000,000" people were jobless by March of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.socialiststudies.org.uk/cinc%201930s.shtml |title=Capitalism In Crisis&nbsp;– Unemployment in 1930s |publisher=Socialist Studies |accessdate=25 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028013514/http://www.socialiststudies.org.uk/cinc%201930s.shtml |archive-date=28 October 2012}}</ref>

Upon entering office in June 1970, Heath immediately set about trying to reverse Wilson's policy of ending Britain's military presence [[East of Suez]].<ref>''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 362</ref>  Heath took the United Kingdom into Europe on 1 January 1973, following passage in Parliament of the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] in October (21 Eliz. II c.68).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/pdfs/ukpga_19720068_en.pdf |title=European Communities Act 1972 |accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> He publicly supported the massive US bombing of [[Hanoi]] and [[Haiphong]] in April 1972.<ref>Curtis, Mark [http://markcurtis.wordpress.com/2007/02/01/britains-secret-support-for-us-aggression-the-vietnam-war/ Britain's Secret Support For US Aggression: The Vietnam War]. Markcurtis.wordpress.com. Retrieved 21 June 2015.</ref>

In October 1973 he placed a British arms embargo on all combatants in the Arab-Israeli [[Yom Kippur War]], which mostly affected the Israelis by preventing them obtaining spares for their Centurion tanks. Heath refused to allow US intelligence gathering from British bases in [[Cyprus]], resulting in a temporary halt in the US signals intelligence tap.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb137/is_3_24/ai_n28939894/ |archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20111208143958/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb137/is_3_24/ai_n28939894/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 December 2011 |work=Harvard International Review |title=Dangerous liaisons: post-September 11 intelligence alliances |year=2002  }}</ref> He also refused permission for the US to use any British bases for resupply.<ref>[http://spyinggame.wordpress.com/2011/07/30/us-uk-special-relationship-06] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413192315/http://spyinggame.wordpress.com/2011/07/30/us-uk-special-relationship-06|date=13 April 2012}}</ref>

He favoured links with the [[People's Republic of China]], visiting [[Mao Zedong]] in Beijing in 1974 and 1975 and remaining an honoured guest in China on frequent visits thereafter and forming a close relationship with Mao's successor [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Heath realised that to become closer to Europe he needed to be further from the United States, so he downplayed the [[Special Relationship]] that had long knitted the two nations together.  The two nations differed on such major crises as Britain's EC membership, the [[Nixonomics|Nixon economic "shocks" of 1971]], the war between India and Pakistan, détente with Russia, Kissinger's Year of Europe and the Middle East crisis of 1973.<ref>Andrew Scott, ''Allies Apart: Heath, Nixon & the Anglo-American Relationship'' (2011).</ref>

===Northern Ireland===
Heath governed during a bloody period in the history of the [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland Troubles]]. On [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday in 1972]], 14 men were shot dead by British soldiers during an anti-internment march in [[Derry|Derry City]]. In early 1971 Heath sent in a [[Secret Intelligence Service]] officer, Frank Steele, to talk to the IRA and find out what common ground there was for negotiations. Steele had carried out secret talks with [[Jomo Kenyatta]] ahead of the British withdrawal from [[Kenya]].<ref>Smith, Michael, ''The Spying Game, the Secret History of British Espionage'', Politicos, London, pp. 378–82<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> In July 1972, Heath permitted his Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw, to hold unofficial talks in London with an IRA delegation by [[Seán Mac Stíofáin]]. In the aftermath of these unsuccessful talks, the Heath government pushed for a peaceful settlement with the democratic political parties.<ref>Ziegler, ''Edward Heath'' (2010) ch. 15</ref>

The 1973 [[Sunningdale Agreement]], which proposed a power-sharing deal, was strongly repudiated by many Unionists and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] who withdrew its MPs at Westminster from the Conservative whip. The proposal was finally brought down by the Loyalist [[Ulster Workers' Council strike]] in 1974, by which time Heath was no longer in office.<ref>Paul Dixon, "British policy towards Northern Ireland 1969–2000: continuity, tactical adjustment and consistent 'inconsistencies'." ''British Journal of Politics and International Relations'' 3#3 (2001): 340–368.</ref>

Heath was targeted by the IRA for introducing internment in Northern Ireland. In December 1974, the [[Balcombe Street siege|Balcombe Street]] [[Active service unit|ASU]] threw a bomb onto the first-floor balcony of his home in Wilton Street, [[Belgravia]] where it exploded. Heath had been conducting a Christmas carol concert at Broadstairs and arrived home 10 minutes after the bomb exploded. No one was injured in the attack, but a landscape painted by Winston Churchill – given to Heath as a present – was damaged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/t-z/year02.html|title=History&nbsp;– The Year London Blew Up|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>

In January 2003, Heath gave evidence to the [[Saville Inquiry]] and stated that he had never sanctioned unlawful lethal force in Northern Ireland.<ref>Douglas Murray, ''Bloody Sunday: Truth, Lies and the Saville Inquiry'' (Biteback Publishing, 2011) ch. 11</ref>

==Fall from power==
===1974 general elections===
Heath tried to bolster his government by calling a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 28 February 1974, using the election slogan "Who governs Britain?". The result of the election was inconclusive with no party gaining an overall majority in the House of Commons; the Conservatives had the most votes but Labour had slightly more seats. Heath began negotiations with [[Jeremy Thorpe]], leader of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] but, when these failed, he resigned as Prime Minister on 4 March 1974, and was replaced by Wilson's minority Labour government, eventually confirmed, though with a tiny majority, in a second election in October.<ref>David E. Butler et al. ''The British General Election of February 1974'' (1975); David E. Butler et al. ''The British General Election of October 1974'' (1975)</ref>

===Rise of Thatcher===
Heath came to be seen as a liability by many Conservative MPs, party activists and newspaper editors. His personality was considered cold and aloof, annoying even to his friends. [[Alan Watkins]] observed in 1991 that his "brusqueness, his gaucherie, his lack of small or indeed any talk, his sheer bad manners" were among the factors costing him the support of Conservative backbenchers in the subsequent [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|Conservative Party leadership election of 1975]].<ref>Watkins 1991, pp. 174–175</ref>

He resolved to remain Conservative leader, even after losing the October 1974 general election, and at first it appeared that by calling on the loyalty of his front-bench colleagues he might prevail. In the weeks following the second election defeat, Heath came under tremendous pressure to concede a review of the rules and agreed to establish a commission to propose changes and to seek re-election. There was no clear challenger after [[Enoch Powell]] had left the party and [[Keith Joseph]] had ruled himself out after controversial statements implying that the working classes should be encouraged to use more birth control. Joseph's close friend and ally [[Margaret Thatcher]], who believed that an adherent to the philosophy of the [[Centre for Policy Studies]] should stand, joined the leadership contest in his place alongside the outsider [[Hugh Fraser (British politician)|Hugh Fraser]]. Aided by [[Airey Neave]]'s campaigning among backbench MPs — whose earlier approach to [[William Whitelaw]] had been rebuffed, out of loyalty to Heath — she emerged as the only serious challenger.<ref>Moore, ''Thatcher'' vol 1, chapters 11–12</ref>

The new rules permitted new candidates to enter the ballot in a second round of voting should the first be inconclusive, so Thatcher's challenge was considered by some to be that of a stalking horse. Neave deliberately understated Thatcher's support in order to attract wavering votes from MPs who were keen to see Heath replaced even though they did not necessarily want Thatcher to replace him.<ref>John Campbell, ''The Grocer's Daughter''</ref><ref>Heath, Edward. ''The Course of My Life'' (1998), p. 532</ref>

On 4 February 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the first ballot by 130 votes to 119, with Fraser coming in a distant third with 16 votes. This was not a big enough margin to give Thatcher the 15% majority necessary to win on the first ballot, but having finished in second place Heath immediately resigned and did not contest the next ballot. His favoured candidate, William Whitelaw, lost to Thatcher in the second vote one week later (Thatcher 146, Whitelaw 79, Howe 19, Prior 19, Peyton 11).<ref>Moore, ''Thatcher'' 1:289–295</ref> The vote polarised along right-left lines, with in addition the region, experience and education of the MP having their effects.  Heath and Whitelaw were stronger on the left, among Oxbridge and public school graduates, and in MPs from Northern England or Scotland.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 194287|title = Peasants' Uprising or Religious War?

Thatcher had promised Heath a seat in the Shadow Cabinet, and planned to offer him whatever post he wanted. His advisors agreed he should wait at least six months, so he declined. He never relented and his refusal was called "the incredible sulk."<ref>Moore, ''Thatcher'' 1:297–298</ref> Thatcher visited Heath at his home shortly after her election as leader, and had to stay for coffee with his PPS [[Timothy Kitson|Tim Kitson]] so the waiting press would not realise how brief the visit had been. Heath claimed that he had simply declined her request for advice about how to handle the press, whilst Thatcher claimed that she offered him any Shadow Cabinet position he wanted and asked him to lead the Conservative campaign in the imminent [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|EEC referendum]], only to be rudely rebuffed.<ref>Ziegler 2010, pp. 490–491</ref>

==Later career (1975–2001)==
[[File:Edward Heath appearing on 'After Dark', 10 June 1989.jpg|thumb|Appearing on television discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV programme)|After Dark]]'' in 1989]]
For many years, Heath persisted in criticism of the party's new ideological direction. At the time of his defeat, he was still popular with rank and file Conservative members and was warmly applauded at the 1975 Conservative Party Conference. He played a leading role in the 1975 referendum campaign in which the UK voted to remain part of the EEC, and he remained active on the international stage, serving on the [[Willy Brandt|Brandt]] Commission investigation into developmental issues, particularly on [[North–South divide in the World|North–South]] projects ([[Brandt Report]]).<ref>Michael McManus, ''Edward Heath: A Singular Life''  (2016) ch. 5</ref>

His relations with Thatcher remained poor, and in 1979–80, he turned down her offers of the positions of [[Incumbent Ambassadors to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]] and [[Secretary General of NATO]].<ref>Moore, ''Thatcher'' 1:430</ref> He continued as a central figure on the left of the party and, at the 1981 Conservative Party conference, openly criticised the government's economic policy of [[monetarism]], which had seen inflation rise from 13% in 1979 to 18% in 1980 then fall to 4% by 1983,<ref>Morely, Stephen. [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120830011628/http://safalra.com/other/historical-uk-inflation-price-conversion/ Historical UK Inflation And Price Conversion].

In 1990, he flew to [[Baghdad]] to attempt to negotiate the release of aircraft passengers and other British nationals taken hostage when [[Saddam Hussein]] invaded [[Kuwait]]. After the events of [[Black Wednesday]] in 1992, he stated in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that government should build a fund of reserves to counter currency speculators.

In 1987, he was nominated in the [[1987 University of Oxford Chancellor election|election for the Chancellorship of the University of Oxford]] but lost to [[Roy Jenkins]] as a result of splitting the Conservative vote with [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Lord Blake]].<ref>McManus, ''Edward Heath: A Singular Life''  (2016) ch. 5</ref>

[[File:Sir Edward Heath 1995.jpg|thumb|upright|Heath in 1995]]
Heath continued to serve as a backbench MP for the London constituency of [[Old Bexley and Sidcup (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Bexley and Sidcup]] and was, from 1992, the longest-serving MP ("[[Father of the House (United Kingdom)|Father of the House]]") and the oldest British MP. As Father of the House, he oversaw the election of two [[Speaker (politics)|Speakers]] of the Commons, [[Betty Boothroyd]] and [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]]. Heath was created a [[Knight of the Garter]] on 23 April 1992.<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/52903/pages/7175 Official announcement of knighthood for Heath], ''The London Gazette''. (issue 52903, 24 April 1992)</ref> He retired from Parliament at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]]. Heath and [[Tony Benn]] were the last two serving MPs to have been elected under the reign of [[George&nbsp;VI]], Heath being the only one to have served continuously since 1950, as Benn's Bristol South East seat was abolished due to boundary changes in 1983 and he failed to win the newly created Bristol East seat, and did not return to the House of Commons until winning the [[1984 Chesterfield by-election|Chesterfield by-election on 1 March 1984]].

==Illness and death==
[[File:Edward Heath monument.jpg|thumb|Heath's monument in [[Salisbury Cathedral]]]]
In August 2003, at the age of 87, Heath suffered a [[pulmonary embolism]] while on holiday in [[Salzburg]], Austria. He never fully recovered, and owing to his declining health and mobility made very few public appearances in the last two years of his life, his last one being at the unveiling of a set of gates at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] dedicated to Sir [[Winston Churchill]] on 30 November 2004.

In his final public statement Heath paid tribute to [[James Callaghan]], who died on 26 March 2005, saying "James Callaghan was a major fixture in the political life of this country during his long and varied career. When in opposition he never hesitated to put firmly his party's case. When in office he took a smoother approach towards his supporters and opponents alike. Although he left the House of Commons in 1987 he continued to follow political life and it was always a pleasure to meet with him. We have lost a major figure from our political landscape".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4385189.stm |title='Tough operator' remembered |work=BBC News |date=26 March 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>

Sir Edward Heath died at his home from [[pneumonia]] at 7.30pm on 17 July 2005, at the age of 89.<ref>https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/sir-edward-heath-dies-1077040</ref> He was cremated on 25 July 2005 at a funeral service attended by 1,500 people. On the day after his death, the [[BBC Parliament]] channel showed the BBC results coverage of the 1970 election. A memorial service was held for Heath in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 8 November 2005, which was attended by 2,000 people. Three days later his ashes were interred in [[Salisbury Cathedral]]. In a tribute to him, the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] stated "He was a man of great integrity and beliefs he held firmly from which he never wavered".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/edward-heath |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825211306/http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/edward-heath |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 August 2008 |title=Edward Heath |publisher=10 Downing Street |accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref>

==Personal life==
===Private residence===
[[File:Sir Edward Heath - Arundells 59 Cathedral Close Salisbury SP1 2EN.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque located on the boundary wall of Arundells]]
In the 1960s, Heath had lived in the [[Albany (London)|Albany]], off Piccadilly; at the unexpected end of his premiership, the French couple living there refused his demand that they move out so that he could have his flat back ("So much for European Unity!" Heath later wrote in his memoirs). For four months, Heath took the flat of Conservative MP [[Timothy Kitson]]; Kitson declined his offer to pay rent but later recalled an occasion when his own watch broke, and Heath in response invited him to take one of a large collection that he had been given on his travels. In July 1974, [[Robert Grosvenor, 5th Duke of Westminster|the Duke of Westminster]], a major London landowner and ardent Europhile, allowed Heath to rent a property in Wilton Street, [[Belgravia]], for an annual rent of £1,250 (just under £10,000 at 2014 prices), a tenth of the market value. The house had three storeys and a basement flat for Heath's housekeeper, and he continued to use it as his London home until old age prevented him from climbing the stairs.<ref>Ziegler 2010, pp. 443–444</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php |title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.K. Pound Amount |publisher=measuringworth.com |accessdate=27 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331194822/https://measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php |archive-date=31 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In February 1985, Heath acquired a Wiltshire home, [[Arundells]], in the [[Cathedral close]] at [[Salisbury]], where he resided until his death twenty years later. In January 2006, it was announced that Heath had placed his house and contents, valued at £5&nbsp;million in his will, in a charitable foundation, the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, to conserve the house as a museum to his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arundells.org/the-foundation/ |title=The Foundation |publisher=Arundells |accessdate=4 September 2016}}</ref> The house is open to the public for guided tours from March to October; displayed therein is a large collection of personal effects as well as Heath's personal library, photo collections, and paintings by Winston Churchill.<ref>[http://www.arundells.org/ Arundells website], arundells.org. Retrieved 27 March 2016.</ref>

In his will, Heath, who had no descendants, left only two legacies: £20,000 to his brother's widow, and £2,500 to his housekeeper.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4632094.stm |title=Former PM Heath left £5m in will |work=BBC News |date=20 January 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>

===Yachting===
Heath was a keen yachtsman. He bought his first yacht ''[[Morning Cloud]]'' in 1969 and won the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] that year. He captained Britain's winning team for the [[Admiral's Cup]] in 1971<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rorc.org/admiralscup/history/1971/default.html |title=rorc.org: "CHAMPAGNE MUMM ADMIRAL'S HISTORY – 1971" |access-date=27 October 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027083822/http://www.rorc.org/admiralscup/history/1971/default.html |archive-date=27 October 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref> – while [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] – and also captained the team in the [[1979 Fastnet race]]. He was a member of the Broadstairs Sailing Club, where he learnt to sail on a [[Snipe (dinghy)|Snipe]] and a [[Fireball (dinghy)|Fireball]] before moving on to success in larger boats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadstairssailingclub.com/history.aspx|title=Broadstairs Sailing Club – History|website=www.broadstairssailingclub.com|accessdate=5 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006012205/http://www.broadstairssailingclub.com/history.aspx|archive-date=6 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Classical music===
Heath maintained an interest in classical music as a pianist, organist and orchestral conductor, famously installing a [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] grand in [[10 Downing Street|10&nbsp;Downing Street]] – bought with his £450 [[Charlemagne Prize]] money, awarded for his unsuccessful efforts to bring Britain into the EEC in 1963, and chosen on the advice of his friend, the pianist [[Moura Lympany]] – and conducting Christmas carol concerts in Broadstairs every year from his teens until old age. Heath often played the organ for services at [[Holy Trinity Brompton Church]] in his early years.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Heath conducted the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], notably at a gala concert at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in November 1971, at which he conducted [[Edward Elgar|Sir Edward Elgar]]'s overture ''[[Cockaigne (In London Town)]]''. He also conducted the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]] and the [[English Chamber Orchestra]], as well as orchestras in [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]. During his premiership, Heath invited musician friends, such as [[Isaac Stern]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[Clifford Curzon]] and the [[Amadeus Quartet]], to perform either at [[Chequers]] or 10 Downing Street.  Heath was the founding President of the European Community Youth Orchestra (in 1976), now the [[European Union Youth Orchestra]].

In 1988, Heath recorded [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto, Op.&nbsp;56]] (with members of the Trio Zingara as soloists) and [[Luigi Boccherini|Boccherini's]] Cello Concerto in G major, G480.<ref>[http://www.juneclassic.net/EN/album/albumdetail.jsp?albumno=gxzht8ra June Classic] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130901020240/http://www.juneclassic.net/EN/album/albumdetail.jsp?albumno=gxzht8ra |date=1 September 2013 }}, juneclassic.net.

===Football===
Heath was a supporter of the [[Lancashire]] football club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], and just after the end of his term as prime minister in 1974 he opened the £450,000 [[Bob Lord (football chairman)|Bob Lord]] Stand at the club's [[Turf Moor]] stadium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/History/0,,10413~1031447,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201152821/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/History/0%2C%2C10413~1031447%2C00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 December 2008 |title=Burnley &#124; The Turf Moor Story |publisher=Burnleyfootballclub.com |accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref>

===Author===
[[File:Boeken, politici, Bestanddeelnr 929-1293.jpg|thumb|Heath [[Book signing|book-signing]] in 1977]]
Heath wrote several books in the second half of the 1970s: ''Sailing'', ''Music'', and ''Travels''. He also compiled a collection of carols called ''The Joy of Christmas'', published in 1978 by Oxford University Press, which contained the music and lyrics to a wide variety of Christmas carols, each accompanied by a reproduction of a piece of religious art and a short introduction by Heath.

Heath's autobiography, ''The Course of My Life'', appeared in 1998. According to his obituary in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', this "had involved dozens of researchers and writers (some of whom he never paid) over many years".<ref>{{cite news |title=Obituary: Sir Edward Heath |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7868577/Sir-Edward-Heath.html |accessdate=23 November 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=18 July 2005}}</ref>

==="Grocer Heath"===
In 1964, despite substantial opposition from many Conservative MPs and independent grocers and shopkeepers, Heath led a successful fight to abolish [[resale price maintenance]].<ref name="RPM">{{cite book |last1=Yamey |first1=Basil S. |title=Resale Price Maintenance |date=2008 |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-202-36227-4 |page=290 |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OI3eRMWZjNwC&q=resale+prices+act+1964+%2B+Edward+Heath&pg=PA290 |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>

===Sexuality===
Heath never married. He had been expected to marry childhood friend Kay Raven, who reportedly tired of waiting and married an RAF officer whom she met on holiday in 1950. In a four-sentence paragraph of his memoirs, Heath claimed that he had been too busy establishing a career after the war and had "perhaps&nbsp;... taken too much for granted". In a 1998 TV interview with Michael Cockerell, Heath said that he had kept her photograph in his flat for many years afterwards.<ref>''Edward Heath&nbsp;– A Very Singular Man'', Blakeway Productions for BBC2, 1998</ref>

His interest in music kept him on friendly terms with female musicians, including pianist [[Moura Lympany]]. When Heath was Prime Minister she was approached by the Conservative MP [[Tufton Beamish, Baron Chelwood|Tufton Beamish]], who said: "Moura, Ted must get married. Will you marry him?" She said she would have done but was in love with someone else.<ref>{{cite news |title=UK Politics: Talking Politics A very singular man |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/179358.stm |accessdate=3 October 2015 |work=BBC News |date=25 September 1998}}</ref> She later said the most intimate thing Heath had done was to put his arm around her shoulder.<ref>''The Guardian'', 19 March 2001</ref>

[[Bernard Levin]] wrote at the time in ''[[The Observer]]'' that the UK had to wait until the emergence of the [[permissive society]] for a prime minister who was a virgin.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/04/edward-heath-philip-ziegler-review |work=The Observer |location=London |first=Geoffrey |last=Wheatcroft |title=Edward Heath: The Authorised Biography by Philip Ziegler |date=4 July 2010}}</ref> In later life, according to his official biographer [[Philip Ziegler]], at dinner parties Heath was "apt to relapse into morose silence or completely ignore the woman next to him and talk across her to the nearest man";<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> others at the time claimed Heath was just not talkative at parties.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benn |first1=Tony |last2=Winstone |first2=Ruth |title=The Benn Diaries |date=1996 |publisher=Arrow |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-963411-9 |pages=363–364 |edition=New single vol. |quote=[[Shirley Williams]] recalled sitting next to Ted Heath at a dinner and when she tried to speak to him, he declined to answer...

[[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]], who published a biography of Heath in 1993, devoted four pages to a discussion of the evidence concerning Heath's sexuality. While acknowledging that Heath was often assumed by the public to be [[gay]], not least because it is "nowadays&nbsp;... whispered of any bachelor", he found "no positive evidence" that this was so "except for the faintest unsubstantiated rumour" (the footnote refers to a mention of a "disturbing incident" at the beginning of the [[Second World War]] in a 1972 biography by [[Andrew Roth]]). Campbell ultimately concluded that the most significant aspect of Heath's sexuality was his complete [[Psychological repression|repression]] of it.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

[[Brian Coleman]], the Conservative Party London Assembly member for [[Barnet and Camden (London Assembly constituency)|Barnet and Camden]], claimed in 2007 that Heath, in order to protect his career, had stopped [[cottaging]] in the 1950s. Coleman said it was "common knowledge" among Conservatives that Heath had been given a stern warning by police when he underwent background checks for the post of [[Privy Councillor]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ted Heath 'stopped cottaging for gay sex to protect his career', says Tory MP {{sic|nolink=y}} |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/ted-heath-stopped-cottaging-for-gay-sex-to-protect-his-career-says-tory-mp-7186167.html |accessdate=8 October 2014 |work=London Evening Standard |date=24 April 2007}}</ref> Heath's biographer Philip Ziegler wrote in 2010 that Coleman was able to provide "little or no information" to back up this statement, that no man had ever claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Heath, nor was any trace of homosexuality to be found in his papers, and that "those who knew him well" insist that he had no such inclination. He believes Heath to have been [[asexuality|asexual]].<ref>Ziegler 2010, pp. 81–82</ref>

[[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Lord Armstrong of Ilminster]], who was Heath's friend and former [[Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister|Private Secretary]], stated his belief that Heath was asexual, saying that he "never detected a whiff of sexuality in relation to men, women or children."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Edward Heath 'completely asexual', says former PM's adviser |date=11 August 2015 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/11/edward-heath-asexual-says-former-adviser |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=11 August 2015 |first=Jamie |last=Grierson}}</ref> Another friend and confidant, Sara Morrison, former Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party, said Heath had "effectively" told her "that he was sexless".<ref>Hanning, James (15 August 2015).
