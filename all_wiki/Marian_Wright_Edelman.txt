Edelman moved in 1968 to [[Washington, D.C.]], where she continued her work and contributed to the organizing of the [[Poor People's Campaign]] of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spelman.edu/about-us/news-and-events/our-stories/stories/2016/01/29/marian-wright-edelman|title=Marian Wright Edelman, Founder and President of the Children's Defense Fund|website=www.spelman.edu|access-date=2018-01-01|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensdefense.org/about/our-history/the-poor-peoples-campaign.html|title=The Poor People's Campaign|website=www.childrensdefense.org|access-date=2018-01-01|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She founded the Washington Research Project, a public interest law firm,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensdefense.org/about/leadership/marian-wright-edelman/|title=Marian Wright Edelman|website=www.childrensdefense.org|access-date=2018-01-01|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and also became interested in issues related to childhood development and children.

In 1973, she founded the [[Children's Defense Fund]] as a voice for poor children, children of color, and children with disabilities. The organization has served as an advocacy and research center for children's issues, documenting the problems and possible solutions to children in need. She also became involved in several school desegregation cases and served on the board of the Child Development Group of Mississippi, which represented one of the largest Head Start programs in the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Darlene Clark|last2=Thompson|first2=Kathleen|title=A shining thread of hope the history of Black women in America|date=1999|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=9780767901116}}</ref>

As leader and principal spokesperson for the CDF, Edelman worked to persuade [[United States Congress]] to overhaul [[foster care]], support adoption, improve child care and protect children who are disabled, homeless, abused or neglected. As she expresses it, "If you don't like the way the world is, you have an obligation to change it. Just do it one step at a time."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Traver|first=Nancy|last2=Ludtke|first2=Melissa|date=1987-03-23|df=mdy-all|title=''They Cannot Fend for Themselves'' That is why Marian Edelman became a top lobbyist for children|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963803,00.html|magazine=Time|volume=129|issue=12}}</ref>

She continues to advocate youth pregnancy prevention, child-care funding, prenatal care, greater parental responsibility in teaching values and curtailing what she sees as children's exposure to the barrage of violent images transmitted by mass media. Several of Edelman's books highlight the importance of children's rights. In her 1987 book titled, ''Families in Peril: An Agenda for Social Change'', Edelman stated, "As adults, we are responsible for meeting the needs of children. It is our moral obligation. We brought about their births and their lives, and they cannot fend for themselves."<ref name="almanac">"Marian Wright Edelman (1939–)."
