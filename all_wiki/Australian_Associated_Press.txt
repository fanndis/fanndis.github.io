AAP's main focus is on breaking news but is also known for its court reporting, sport, comprehensive political coverage, feature stories, and award-winning photographs. It also produces video and visual explainers. AAP is one of the few remaining non-government newswires in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hardaker|first=David|last2=Wilkins|first2=Georgia|date=2020-03-09|title=Inside story: who — or what — killed Australian Associated Press?|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/03/09/aap-australian-associated-press-closing/|access-date=2020-11-19|website=Crikey|language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:KeithMurdoch.jpg|thumb|263x263px|[[Keith Murdoch]], who led the merger to form the AAP.]]
Australia was first linked to international telegraph services by a submarine cable that linked Java to Darwin, which was laid by the British-Australian Telegraph Company, and completed on 18 November 1871.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stephen|first=Thompson|date=January 2012|title=1871 The Overland Telegraph Line: Telegraph Collection|url=http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/1871-the-overland-telegraph-line-telegraph-collection/index.html|access-date=2020-11-19|website=NSW Migration Heritage Centre|language=en-US}}</ref> The Eastern states were connected through Adelaide on the completion of the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]] in 1872.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|date=15 April 2020|title=Overland telegraph|url=https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/overland-telegraph|access-date=2020-11-19|website=National Museum of Australia|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> As a result, the time it took to transmit news from Europe to Australia was dramatically reduced, having previously taken weeks or months to arrive via post on ships, news could now be transmitted in just hours by telegraph.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=Thompson|first=David|date=2008|title=Australia and the global telegraph network 1854-1902|url=https://collections.museumsvictoria.com.au/articles/2619|access-date=2020-11-19|website=Museums Victoria Collections}}</ref> Anticipating that the cost of sending messages would be high, the Melbourne newspaper [[The Argus (Melbourne)|''The Argus'']] formed an association with ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', creating an agreement with the [[Reuters]] news agency for the transmission of news to Australia.<ref name=":6" /> This group successfully lobbied the Government of Victoria to pass the first copyright legislation of its kind in the world in 1871, protecting news material transmitted electronically for 24 hours from its first publication.<ref name=":6" />

=== New Zealand Newswire ===
After the closure of the AAP’s New Zealand counterpart the [[New Zealand Press Association]] on the 31 August 2011, the AAP launched a '''New Zealand Newswire''' (NZN) division on 5 September 2011 with offices in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stone|first=Andrew|date=2011-08-30|title=Farewell NZPA, hello three new services|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/farewell-nzpa-hello-three-new-services/55GKH4KOF2DNYZ722F5HD2MFBI/|access-date=2020-11-04|website=NZ Herald|language=en-NZ}}</ref> NZN employed 14 journalists split across Auckland and Wellington.

While news outlets initially sourced content from the AAP predominantly for foreign news and war reporting, they became increasingly reliant on the service for domestic and breaking news.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Jane|last2=Forde|first2=Susan|date=2009|title='Not wrong for long': the role and penetration of news wire agencies in the 24/7 news landscape|url=https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/30680|journal=Global Media Journal|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=1–16}}</ref> It has been noted that all major newspapers once reported from Canberra’s parliamentary press gallery, but in recent times often only AAP and ABC reporters were present.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":7" /> As a result the AAP is increasingly seen as the ‘silent partner’ of Australian news outlets, almost all of which publish increasing amounts of copy from the newswire.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Jane|last2=Forde|first2=Susan|date=2011-01-24|title=The Silent Partner: News Agencies and 21st Century news|url=https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/928|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=5|issue=0|pages=20|issn=1932-8036}}</ref>

By the 2010s it became common practice for newspapers to republish AAP copy, with minor edits and sometimes verbatim, sometimes including an ‘AAP’ byline and at times omitting one.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":9" /> This practice of publishing AAP, and other newswire, copy with little to no changes has been referred to as ‘churnalism’.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":12" /> Content from the AAP is particularly prevalent on online news sites, as a way to cut down costs.<ref name=":12" /> A 2009 study found that the online breaking news sections of [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|''The Daily Telegraph'']] and ''The Age'', were more that half unchanged AAP reports, with the remainder predominantly sourced from international newswires, and suggested errors in AAP reporting are spread and republished in a homogeneous news environment.<ref name=":12" /> A 2013 study found that when the AAP reported on media relations output like press releases, it most often included little change from the original source, and as a result many newspapers were publishing media release content 'recycled' through the AAP.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Forde|first=Susan|last2=Johnston|first2=Jane|date=2013-02-01|title=The News Triumvirate|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2012.679859|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=14|issue=1|pages=113–129|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2012.679859|issn=1461-670X}}</ref>

The AAP established [[AAPT Limited|AAPT]], a telecommunications division offering long-distance voice and data services in 1991, which was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] and sold to [[Telecom New Zealand]] in 2000.<ref name=":1" /> It was sold again to [[TPG Telecom]] in 2013.

As part of AAP's sale and relaunch in 2020, several divisions of the agency were spun off and retained by the agency's prior owners [[Nine Entertainment Co.|Nine Entertainment]], News Corp Australia, [[Seven West Media]] and [[Australian Community Media]]. This included ‘Medianet’ its media planning and public relations service, ‘Mediaverse’ a service for research and analysis of media, ‘ConnectWeb’ a directory service for biographical data, ‘Pagemasters’ a digital publishing and design service, and ‘Megaform’ which provides information about horse racing.<ref name=":3" /> The services were housed under the umbrella of a new company called Medality, employing 130 staff, 95 being full-time roles, with the head office in Sydney moving into the News Corp Australia Building.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|last=Pash|first=Chris|date=20 July 2020|title=What’s left of AAP will be called Mediality|url=https://www.adnews.com.au/news/what-s-left-of-aap-will-be-called-mediality|access-date=2020-11-20|website=AdNews|language=en}}</ref> Bruce Davidson, the former CEO of the AAP became the CEO of Mediality.<ref name=":11" />
