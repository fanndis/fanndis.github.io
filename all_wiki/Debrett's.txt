==Appearances in popular culture==
An out-of-date Debrett's is a key plot element in an Elizabeth Mapp story{{vague|date=May 2019}} (1920–1939) by [[E. F. Benson]].

In series three of the television series ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', Lady Cora Grantham mentions ''Debrett's'' in jest when defending the choice of her late daughter, Sybil, to have her daughter baptised as [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].

There was a storyline in ''[[Doonesbury]]'' where [[Zonker Harris|Zonker]] had a large cash windfall with which he planned to purchase a British [[peerage]]. To prepare for his new role, he had a friend quiz him from ''Debrett's'', to great comic effect.

In ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' by [[Evelyn Waugh]], Sebastian says to Charles on defending his not letting Charles meet his family when they visit Brideshead the first time together, "You don't know what you've been saved. There are lots of us. Look them up in Debrett."

In [[Montague Rhodes James]]' ''The Residence at Whitminster'', Uncle Oldys draws his information about the (spooking) viscount of Kildonan from Debrett's ''Peerage'': "It's all in Debrett's – two little fat books".

==John Debrett==
{{Main|John Debrett}}
John Debrett (8 January 1753 – 15 November 1822) was the London-born son of Jean Louys de Bret, a French cook of [[Huguenot]] extraction and his wife Rachel Panchaud. As a boy of thirteen, John Debrett was apprenticed to a [[Piccadilly]] bookseller and publisher, Robert Davis. He remained there until 1780, when he moved across Piccadilly to work for John Almon, bookseller and stationer. John Almon edited and published his first edition of ''The New Peerage'' in 1769, and went on to produce at least three further editions. By 1790 he had passed the editorship on to John Debrett who, in 1802, put his name to the two small volumes that made up ''The Correct Peerage of England, Scotland and Ireland''. Despite twice being declared bankrupt, Debrett continued as a bookseller and editor of the ''Peerage''; the last edition edited by him was the 15th edition, which was published in 1823. He was found dead at his lodgings on 15 November 1822, and was buried at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St James's Church]], Piccadilly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.co.uk/about.php?category=1|title=About Debrett's |website=Debrett's |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804113925/http://www.debretts.co.uk/about.php?category=1 |archivedate=4 August 2008 }}</ref>

John Debrett married on 27 April 1787 in Piccadilly to Sophia Granger (1762–1833), daughter of Captain John Granger and Sophia Spencley. They had six children, none of whom followed their father into the book trade although Sophia did work with her husband and at one point ran the business herself.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage|publisher=Debrett's Ltd|year=2019|isbn=978-1999767006|edition=150th|location=https://www.debretts.com/product/debretts-peerage/|pages=2–11}}</ref>
