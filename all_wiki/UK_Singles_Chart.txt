The '''UK Singles Chart''' (currently entitled '''Official Singles Chart''') is compiled by the [[Official Charts Company]] (OCC), on behalf of the British [[record industry]], listing the top-selling singles in the [[United Kingdom]], based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and [[music streaming|streaming]]. The Official Chart, broadcast on BBC Radio 1 and MTV (Official UK Top 40), is the UK music industry's recognised official measure of singles and albums popularity because it is the most comprehensive research panel of its kind, today surveying over 15,000 retailers and digital services daily, capturing 99.9% of all singles consumed in Britain across the week, and over 98% of albums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/getting-into-the-charts/how-the-charts-are-compiled/|title=How The Charts Are Compiled|last=Kreisler|first=Lauren|date=12 March 2018|website=OfficialCharts.com|access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref> To be eligible for the chart, a [[Single (music)|single]] is currently defined by the [[Official Charts Company]] (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/media/319099/official-uk-charts-singles-chart-rules-april-2013.pdf|title=Rules For Chart Eligibility: Singles|date=April 2013|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|location=London|page=4|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in July 2014.<ref name="streaming">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/streaming-and-the-official-singles-chart-everything-you-need-to-know-3109/ |title=Streaming and the Official Singles Chart: Everything you need to know! |first=Daniel |last=Lane |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>

The Top 40 chart is first issued on Friday afternoons by [[BBC Radio 1]] as ''[[The Official Chart]]'' from 16:00 to 17:45, before the full Official Singles Chart Top 100 is posted on the Official Charts Company's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/singles-chart/ |title=Official UK Singles Top 100 - 8th December 2012 &#124; Official UK Top 40 &#124; music charts &#124; Official Singles Chart |publisher=Officialcharts.com |accessdate=5 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201070644/http://www.officialcharts.com/singles-chart/ |archivedate=1 December 2013 }}</ref> A rival chart show, ''[[The Official Big Top 40]]'', is broadcast on Sunday afternoons from 16:00 to 19:00 on [[Capital (radio network)|Capital]] and [[Heart (radio network)|Heart]] stations across the United Kingdom. The Official Big Top 40 is based on Apple data only, (Apple Music streams and iTunes downloads) plus commercial radio airplay across the Global Radio network. There is also a show called "Official KISS Top 40", counting down 40 most played songs on [[Kiss (UK radio station)|Kiss FM]] every Sunday 17:00 to 19:00.

The UK Singles Chart began to be compiled in 1952. According to the Official Charts Company's statistics, as of 1 July 2012, 1,200 singles have topped the UK Singles Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/will.i.ams-first-solo-number-1-this-is-love-smashes-100k-sales-1467 |title=Will.I.Am's This Is Love becomes UK's 1200th Number 1 |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=6 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022155808/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/will.i.ams-first-solo-number-1-this-is-love-smashes-100k-sales-1467 |archivedate=22 October 2012 }}</ref> The precise number of chart-toppers is debatable due to the profusion of competing charts from the 1950s to the 1980s, but the usual list used is that endorsed by the [[Guinness Book of British Hit Singles]] and subsequently adopted by the Official Charts Company. The company regards a selected period of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' chart (only from 1952 to 1960) and the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart from 1960 to 1969 as predecessors for the period prior to 11 February 1969, where multiples of competing charts (none official) coexisted side by side. For example, the BBC compiled its own chart based on an average of the music papers of the time; many songs announced as having reached number one on BBC Radio and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' prior to 1969 are not listed as chart-toppers according to the legacy criteria of the Charts Company.

The first number one on the UK Singles Chart was "[[Here in My Heart]]" by [[Al Martino]] for the week ending 14 November 1952. As of the week ending 3 December 2020, the UK Singles Chart has had 1378 different number one hits. The current number one is "[[Positions (song)|Positions]]" by [[Ariana Grande]].

== History ==

=== {{anchor|early}}Early charts ===
Before the compilation of sales of records, the music market measured a song's popularity by sales of [[sheet music]]. The idea of compiling a chart based on sales originated in the [[United States]], where the music-trade paper ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' compiled the first chart incorporating sales figures on 20 July 1940. Record charts in the UK began in 1952, when Percy Dickins of the [[NME|''New Musical Express'' (''NME'')]] gathered a pool of 52 stores willing to report sales figures.<ref name="Dickins">{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/19/guardianobituaries1 |title= Obituary: Percy Dickins|last= Williams |first= Mark|date= 19 February 2002|work= [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 July 2010}}<!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20100722115740/http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,652467,00.html if this goes dead --></ref><ref name="McAleer">{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Alan |title=50s & 60s UK Charts – The Truth! |url=http://www.davemcaleer.com/page21.htm |work=[[Dave McAleer]]'s website |accessdate=4 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510032556/http://www.davemcaleer.com/page21.htm |archivedate=10 May 2011 }}</ref> For the first British chart Dickins telephoned approximately 20 shops, asking for a list of the 10 best-selling songs.

However, until 1969 the Record Retailer chart was only seen by people working in the industry. The most widely circulated chart was the NME one, as used by [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]]'s Sunday night ''Top 20'' show, as well as by ABC TV's ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (TV series)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'', which had an audience of up to 6 million on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

Before 1969 there was no official singles chart.<ref name="McAleer"/><ref name="Independent"/>{{sfn|Warwick|Kutner|Brown|2004|p=v}}<!--Quote: Until 15 February 1969, there was no officially compiled chart.--> ''Record Retailer'' and the [[BBC]] commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to compile charts, beginning 15 February 1969.<ref name="McAleer"/><ref name="The Official Charts Company"/> The BMRB compiled its first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops.<ref name="The Official Charts Company"/> The sampling cost approximately [[Pound sterling|£]]52,000; shops were randomly chosen from a pool of approximately 6,000, and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. The sales diaries were translated into [[Punched card|punch cards]] so the data could be interpreted by a computer. A computer then compiled the chart on Monday, and the BBC were informed of the Top 50 on Tuesday in time for it to be announced on [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)#BBC Radio 1|Johnnie Walker's afternoon show]]. The charts were also published in ''Record Retailer'' (rebranded ''Record & Tape Retailer'' in 1971 and ''[[Music Week]]'' in 1972)<ref name="BL"/> and ''[[Record Mirror]]''.<ref name="McAleer"/> However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The [[1971 United Kingdom postal workers strike|1971 postal strike]] meant data had to be collected by telephone (and that the chart was reduced to a Top 40 during this period),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/who-we-are/seventies-history/|title= The history of the Official Charts: the Seventies|website=OfficialCharts.com|access-date=4 May 2020}}</ref> but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart; by 1973, the BMRB was using [[motorcycle courier]]s to collect sales figures.<ref name="McAleer"/> In March 1978, two record industry publications, ''Radio & Record News'' and ''Record Business'' both started publishing Top 100 singles charts, so in response, in May 1978, the BMRB singles chart was expanded from a Top 50 to a Top 75, while abolishing the system where some falling records were excluded from the 41-50 section, as well as abandoning the additional list of 10 "Breakers". Earlier that year, the [[Daily Mirror]] and the BBC's [[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]] television programme both investigated chart hyping, where record company representatives allegedly purchased records from chart return shops. A ''[[World in Action]]'' documentary exposé in 1980 also revealed corruption within the industry; stores' chart-returns dealers would frequently be offered bribes to falsify sales logs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yMEAAAAMBAJ&q=World+in+Action+John+Fruin&pg=PT77|title=Inquiry Expected After Claims Of U.K. Chart Hyping|last=Hennesey|first=Mike|date=30 August 1980|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|pages=1, 78, 83|accessdate=6 September 2010|location=London}}</ref>

The 1980s also saw the introduction of the [[cassette single]] (or "cassingle") alongside the [[7-inch single|7-inch]] and [[12-inch single|12-inch]] record formats; in 1987, major record labels developed a common format for the compact disc single.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/02/arts/cassette-singles-new-45-s.html|title=Cassette Singles: New 45's|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=2 September 1987|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=21|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> In May 1989, chart regulations kept [[Kylie Minogue]]'s song "[[Hand on Your Heart]]" from entering at number one because sales from cassette singles were not included (they were sold for £1.99 – cheaper than allowed at the time).

Subsequently, CIN sought to develop new marketing opportunities and sponsorship deals; these included premium-rate fax and telephone services and the chart newsletters ''Charts+Plus'' (published from May 1991 to November 1994) and ''[[Hit Music (Newsletter)|Hit Music]]'' (published from September 1992 to May 2001). Beginning in May 1991 ''Charts+Plus'' featured singles charts with positions 76–200 (plus artist albums positions 76–150, Top 50 compilations, and several genre and format charts). In September 1992, a second newsletter was created: ''Hit Music'', a sister publication of ''Music Week'' featuring (among other charts) the singles Top 75 and a revived "Next 25". In November 1994, ''Charts+Plus'' ceased publication; ''Hit Music'' expanded its chart coverage to an uncompressed (without special rules) Top 200 Singles, Top 150 Artists Albums and Top 50 Compilations. In November 1996, the Artist Albums chart extended to a Top 200. ''Hit Music'' ceased publication in May 2001 with issue number 439.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukchartsplus.co.uk/background.htm|title=Background|work=[[ChartsPlus|UKChartsPlus]]|accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref>

In February 1997, CIN and BARD agreed to a new 18-month deal for the charts.<ref>{{cite journal|date=20 December 1997|title=News Review of the Year – 97's menu: Spice, Ginger and Elton|journal=[[Music Week]]|issn=0265-1548}}</ref> In 1998 the CSC agreed to new rules reducing the number of tracks on a single from four to three, playing time from 25 minutes to 20 and the compact disc single minimum dealer price to £1.79.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Robert|last=Ashton|date=4 April 1998|title=CSC acts to solve "fillers" issue|journal=[[Music Week]]|issn=0265-1548}}</ref>
This particularly affected the dance music industry which had previously released CDs full of remixes, with some labels having to edit or fade out remixes early in order to fit them on a CD single. On 1 July 1998, BARD and BPI took over management of the chart from the CIN (a Miller Freeman and BPI venture) with new company Music Industry Chart Services (Mics);<ref>{{cite journal|date=1 August 1998|title=MW signs new charts deal|journal=[[Music Week]]|issn=0265-1548}}</ref> however, in August they decided to return to compiling the charts under the name CIN.<ref>{{cite journal|date=8 August 1998|title=BPI–BARD venture keeps CIN name|journal=[[Music Week]]|issn=0265-1548}}</ref>

In 1999, Millward Brown began "re-chipping" some retailers' machines, in anticipation of the [[millennium bug]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=13 February 1999|title=Millward Brown launches indie millennium initiative|journal=[[Music Week]]|issn=0265-1548}}</ref> However, some independent retailers lost access to the record-label-funded Electronic Record Ordering System (Eros); it was "too costly to make it [[Year 2000 problem#Programming solutions|Year 2000 compliant]]".<ref>{{cite journal|date=13 March 1999|title=A lifeline for Epos stores?|journal=[[Music Week]]|issn=0265-1548}}</ref> Towards the end of the 1990s companies anticipated distributing singles over the Internet, following the example of [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]] and [[Liquid Audio]] (who made 2,000 tracks available for digital download in the US).<ref>{{cite journal|date=22 June 1999|title=Sony blazes internet singles trail|journal=[[Music Week]]|issn=0265-1548}}</ref>

[[File:Nobel Peace Price Concert 2009 Westlife2.jpg|thumb|Irish boy band [[Westlife]] achieved the first number one on the UK Singles Downloads Chart with "[[Flying Without Wings]]" in September 2004.]]
In January 2004, [[MyCoke]] Music launched as the "first significant download retailer".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/history-of-the-official-charts/ |title=History Of The Official Charts |publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=15 November 2010 |format=<span style="font-size:0.95em; font-weight:bold; color:#555;">[[Adobe Flash]] required</span> |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010123714/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/history-of-the-official-charts/ |archivedate=10 October 2010 }}<br />''Click or hover mouse on the picture of the laptop in January 2004''</ref> Legal downloading was initially small, with MyCokeMusic selling over 100,000 downloads during its first three months.

In 2005, [[Wes Butters]] presented his final UK Top 40 show, concluding his tenure at Radio 1. The chart show was then rebranded for the chart week ending 16 April, and the first singles chart combining physical-release sales with legal downloads began. Several test charts (and a download-sales chart) were published in 2004; this combination (within the official singles chart) reflected a changing era in which sales of physical singles fell and download sales rose. On 17 April 2005, hosts JK and Joel commented during their [[BBC Radio 1]] broadcast that the incorporation of download sales resulted in an approximate doubling of singles sales for the week. For the first week's combined chart the impact of this doubling was not readily apparent at the top of the chart, although a few singles in the middle positions benefited.

Initially, the British Association of Record Dealers was concerned that the popularity of downloading would siphon business from the [[High Street]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} It also complained that including singles not available physically would confuse customers and create gaps in stores' sale racks. However, it agreed to the new rules provided that digital sales were only included to a single's sales tally if there was a physical equivalent sold in shops at the time. Since there was no rule governing a minimum number of pressings, [[Gorillaz]] released only 300 vinyl copies of their single "[[Feel Good Inc.]]" on 12 April 2005 (a month before its general release). This allowed it to debut in the chart at number 22 (eventually reaching number 2), and remain in the Top 40 for a longer period.

After pressure from elsewhere in the music industry a second compromise was reached in 2006, which now allowed singles to chart on downloads the week before their physical release. The first song to make the Top 40 on downloads alone was "[[Pump It]]" by [[The Black Eyed Peas]], which charted at number 16 on 12 March 2006. Three weeks later, "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]" by [[Gnarls Barkley]] became the first song to top the charts on download sales alone. As part of the revised rules, singles would now be removed from the chart two weeks after the deletion of their physical formats; "Crazy" left the chart 11 weeks later from number 5. This was in addition to the existing rule that to be eligible for the chart, the physical single had to have been released within the last twelve months, supporting the general view that the chart reflected the top-selling "current" releases.

On 1 January 2007 the integration of downloaded music into the charts became complete when all downloads – with or without a physical equivalent – became eligible to chart, redefining the UK singles chart by turning it into a "songs" chart. "[[Chasing Cars]]" by [[Snow Patrol]] returned at a Top 10 position (number 9, just three places below the peak it had reached the previous September), while "[[Honey to the Bee]]" by [[Billie Piper]] (following a tongue-in-cheek promotional push by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[Chris Moyles]] to test the new chart rules) reappeared at number 17 (nearly eight years after its original appearance on the charts).

The first number-one hit never released physically was "[[Run (Snow Patrol song)#Leona Lewis version|Run]]" by [[Leona Lewis]], the 11th song in total to reach number one on downloads alone. Unlike the previous 10, it did not receive a physical release in subsequent weeks (although it was released physically overseas, notably in Germany).

It was announced in June 2014 that as of Sunday, 29 June, audio streams from services such as [[Spotify]], [[Deezer]], [[Napster]], O2 Tracks, [[Xbox Music]], Sony Unlimited and [[Rara.com|rara]] would be counted towards the Official Singles Chart, in order to reflect changing music consumption in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kreisler|first1=Lauren|title=UK's Official Singles Chart to include streaming data for first time|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uks-official-singles-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time-3105/|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=OfficialCharts.com|date=22 June 2014}}</ref> The final number one on the UK Singles Chart to be based on sales alone was "[[Gecko (Overdrive)]]" by [[Oliver Heldens]] featuring [[Becky Hill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/oliver-heldens-and-becky-hill-knock-ella-henderson-off-number-1-3124/|title=Oliver Heldens and Becky Hill knock Ella Henderson off Number 1|work=officialcharts.com}}</ref> On Sunday 6 July 2014, the [[Official Charts Company]] announced that [[Ariana Grande]] had earned a place in UK chart history when her single "[[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]]" featuring [[Iggy Azalea]] became the first number-one single based on sales and streaming data.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lane|first1=Daniel|title=Ariana Grande earns a place in Official Chart history with Problem|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/ariana-grande-earns-a-place-in-official-chart-history-with-problem-3146/|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|date=6 July 2014}}</ref>

On 7 December 2014, [[Ed Sheeran]]'s "[[Thinking Out Loud]]" became the first single to reach number one as a direct result of streaming inclusion. Despite [[Union J]]'s "[[You Got It All (Union J song)|You Got It All]]" topping the Sales Chart that week, "Thinking Out Loud" was streamed 1.6 million times in the same week, resulting in an overall lead of 13,000 chart sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/ed-sheeran-returns-to-official-singles-chart-number-1-with-thinking-out-loud__7639/|title=Ed Sheeran returns to Official Singles Chart Number 1 with Thinking Out Loud|work=officialcharts.com}}</ref>

On 10 March 2017, [[Ed Sheeran]] claimed 9 of the top 10 positions in the chart when his album ''[[÷ (album)|÷]]'' was released.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39265093|title=Five ways the singles chart can be fixed|newspaper=BBC News|date=14 March 2017|last1=Savage|first1=Mark}}</ref> The large number of tracks from the album on the singles chart, 16 in the top 20, led to a change in how the chart is compiled with tracks from a lead artist eligible for entry limited to three.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/official-charts-company-new-rules-cut-ed-sheeran-dominance-2094617|title=Official Charts Company introduces new rules that could prevent repeat of Ed Sheeran's chart dominance |work=NME |first=Sam |last=Moore |date=26 June 2017 |accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>

===Comparison of singles charts (1952–1969)===
{{Main|List of UK charts and number-one singles (1952–1969)}}

With no official chart before 1969, a number of periodicals compiled their own charts during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|Pirate radio]] stations such as [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] and [[Radio Caroline]] also broadcast their own charts.<ref name=mw>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Music Week]]|title=From Rivals Chart To Popstars Rivals|page=5|edition=Celebrating 50 Years of the Singles Chart|date=16 November 2002|last=Williams|first=Paul}}</ref> The five main charts (as used by [[BBC]]'s ''[[Pick of the Pops]]'') were:
* [[NME|''New Musical Express'' (''NME'')]] (1952–1988): The first singles chart, a major source until March 1960, widely followed throughout the 1960s
* ''[[Record Mirror]]'' (1955–1962): The second singles chart; compiled the first album chart, published ''Record Retailer'' chart from 1962. The ''Pick of the Pops'' average stopped using ''Record Mirror'' after 21 May 1960, due to the paper changing its weekly publication day
* ''[[Melody Maker]]'' (1956–1988): The third singles chart, major source for album charts from 1958 onwards
* [[Disc (magazine)|''Disc'']] (1958–1967): The fourth singles chart
* ''[[Record Retailer]]'' (1960–1969): The fifth singles chart; a trade paper, regarded as a major source from its inception; jointly formed BMRB chart in 1969. Not included in the ''Pick of the Pops'' average until 31 March 1962.

=={{anchor|Criteria for inclusion}}Inclusion criteria==
The full regulations may be downloaded from the Official Charts Company website (see "[[#External links|External links]]", below).

To qualify for inclusion in the UK singles chart, a single must be available in one or more of the following eligible formats:

The managing director of the Official Charts Company, Martin Talbot, said in a statement that it would provide "insight into how the race for number one is shaping up".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/10056409|title=Official midweek 'chart update' launched|work=[[Newsbeat]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 November 2010|date=2 January 2010}}</ref> [[Scott Mills]] became the host of the Chart Update from April 2012, due to schedule changes which saw Mills host what was Greg's early afternoon show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-02-28/scott-mills-loses-drive-time-slot-to-greg-james-in-radio-1-shake-up|title=Scott Mills Loses Drive Time Slot to Greg James|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref>  When the chart moved to Fridays in July 2015, the chart update moved to 5:30 pm on Mondays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-chart-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-week-ahead__9971/|title=The Official Chart: Everything you need to know about the week ahead|date=4 July 2015|first=Martin|last=Talbot|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> The show was then once again hosted by Greg James and the top ten songs are quickly overviewed with the top three being played in full before [[Newsbeat]] at 5:45. It was presented by [[Nick Grimshaw]] due to his swap of times with Greg James. In 2019 it was moved to a new time of Sunday evenings between 6  pm and 7 pm presented by [[Cel Spellman]] and [[Katie Thistleton]] replacing the Radio 1 Most Played Chart. The top twenty is overviewed with around fifteen song being played in full including the full top ten.

==Sponsorship==
In 1999, the chart was sponsored by worldpop.com with the company receiving name recognition during the BBC programme. However, the deal ended when the website went out of business in late 2001. As part of an agreement with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' to publish the UK chart in section of their magazine, ''Billboard'' required the chart to have a sponsor. In 2003, it was announced that [[Coca-Cola]] had signed a two-year contract with the Official Charts Company beginning 1 January 2004. Although the amount was not publicly disclosed, it was believed to be between [[Pound sterling|£]]1.5&nbsp;million and £2&nbsp;million. Since advertising on the BBC is prohibited under the [[BBC Charter]] and the government was attempting to reduce [[childhood obesity]], the decision was widely criticised. Coca-Cola was restricted to two on-air mentions during the chart show, with the BBC justifying the deal by saying it did not negotiate or benefit financially.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Legrand|first=Emmanuel|date=13 December 2003|title=Coke Deal is Real Thing for U.K. Music Charts|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc.]]|volume=115|issue=50|pages=9, 62|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9}}</ref> A few days into the contract, the BBC agreed to drop on-air mentions of the brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=6029&sectioncode=1|title=BBC to pull chart sponsor credits|date=2 January 2004|work=[[Music Week]]|accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref>
