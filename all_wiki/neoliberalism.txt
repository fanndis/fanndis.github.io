==Terminology==

===Origins===
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Hayek]]]]
An early use of the term in English was in 1898 by the French economist [[Charles Gide]] to describe the economic beliefs of the Italian economist [[Maffeo Pantaleoni]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gide|first=Charles|date=1898-01-01|title=Has Co-operation Introduced a New Principle into Economics?|jstor=2957091|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=8|issue=32|pages=490–511|doi=10.2307/2957091|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1449661}}</ref> with the term ''néo-libéralisme'' previously existing in French,<ref name="OxfordNeoliberalism"/> and the term was later used by others including the classical liberal economist [[Milton Friedman]] in his 1951 essay [https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 "Neo-Liberalism and its Prospects].<ref name="Burgin2012">{{cite book|author=Angus Burgin|title=The Great Persuasion: Reinventing Free Markets since the Depression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnZ1qKdXojoC&pg=PA170|date=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06743-1|page=170}}</ref> In 1938 at the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]], the term ''neoliberalism'' was proposed, among other terms, and ultimately chosen to be used to describe a certain set of economic beliefs.<ref name="mirowski"/>{{rp|12–13}}<ref>[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}, p. 19</ref> The colloquium defined the concept of neoliberalism as involving "the priority of the price mechanism, free enterprise, the system of competition, and a strong and impartial state".<ref name="mirowski"/>{{rp|13–14}} To be ''neoliberal'' meant advocating a modern economic policy with [[state intervention]].<ref name="mirowski"/>{{rp|48}} Neoliberal state interventionism brought a clash with the opposing ''laissez-faire'' camp of classical liberals, like [[Ludwig von Mises]].<ref>[[Jörg Guido Hülsmann]], [https://mises.org/daily/6022/ Against the Neoliberals], Ludwig von Mises Institute, May 2012</ref> Most scholars in the 1950s and 1960s understood neoliberalism as referring to the social market economy and its principal economic theorists such as Eucken, Röpke, Rüstow and Müller-Armack. Although Hayek had intellectual ties to the German neoliberals, his name was only occasionally mentioned in conjunction with neoliberalism during this period due to his more pro-free market stance.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Neoliberalism: From New Liberal Philosophy to Anti-Liberal Slogan |author=Taylor C.

During the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|military rule under Augusto Pinochet]] (1973–1990) in Chile, opposition scholars took up the expression to describe the [[Economic history of Chile (1973-1990)#"Neoliberal" reforms (1973–1990)|economic reforms implemented there]] and its proponents (the [[Chicago Boys]]).<ref name=Boas2009/> Once this new meaning was established among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of political economy.<ref name=Boas2009/> According to one study of 148 scholarly articles, neoliberalism is almost never defined but used in several senses to describe ideology, economic theory, development theory, or economic reform policy. It has become used largely as a [[term of abuse]] and/or to imply a ''laissez-faire'' [[market fundamentalism]] virtually identical to that of classical liberalism – rather than the ideas of those who attended the 1938 colloquium. As a result there is controversy as to the precise meaning of the term and its usefulness as a descriptor in the [[social science]]s, especially as the number of different kinds of market economies have proliferated in recent years.<ref name=Boas2009/>

Another center-left movement from [[modern American liberalism]] that used the term "neoliberalism" to describe its ideology formed in the [[United States]] in the 1970s. According to political commentator [[David Brooks (commentator)|David Brooks]], prominent neoliberal politicians included [[Al Gore]] and [[Bill Clinton]] of the Democratic Party of the United States.<ref>David Brooks, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/opinion/11brooks.html?_r=0 The Vanishing Neoliberal], The New York Times, 2007</ref> The neoliberals coalesced around two magazines, ''[[The New Republic]]'' and the ''[[Washington Monthly]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/04/chait-neoliberal-new-inquiry-democrats-socialism/|title=The First Neoliberals|last= Robin|first=Corey|date= April 28, 2016|website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|access-date= April 23, 2017}}</ref> The "godfather" of this version of neoliberalism was the journalist [[Charles Peters]],<ref>Matt Welch, [http://reason.com/archives/2013/03/25/the-death-of-contrarianism The Death of Contrarianism.

===Current usage===
Elizabeth Shermer argued that the term gained popularity largely among left-leaning academics in the 1970s to "describe and decry a late twentieth-century effort by policy makers, think-tank experts, and industrialists to condemn social-democratic reforms and unapologetically implement free-market policies;"<ref>Elizabeth Tandy Shermer, "Review," ''Journal of Modern History''  (Dec 2014) 86#4 pp. 884–90</ref> economic historian Phillip W.

''Neoliberalism'' is contemporarily used to refer to market-oriented reform policies such as "eliminating [[price control]]s, [[deregulation|deregulating]] [[capital markets]], lowering [[trade barriers]]" and reducing state influence in the economy, especially through [[privatization]] and [[austerity]].<ref name="Boas2009" /> It is also commonly associated with the economic policies introduced by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States.<ref name="For Business Ethics" /> Some scholars note it has a number of distinct usages in different spheres:{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

* As a [[development model]], it refers to the rejection of [[structuralist economics]] in favor of the [[Washington Consensus]].
* As an [[ideology]], it denotes a conception of freedom as an overarching [[Value (ethics)|social value]] associated with reducing state functions to those of a [[minimal state]].
* As a [[public policy]], it involves the privatization of public economic sectors or services, the deregulation of private corporations, sharp decrease of [[government debt]] and reduction of spending on [[public works]].

There is, however, debate over the meaning of the term. Sociologists [[Fred L. Block]] and Margaret R. Somers claim there is a dispute over what to call the influence of free-market ideas which have been used to justify the retrenchment of [[New Deal]] programs and policies since the 1980s: neoliberalism, ''[[laissez-faire]]'' or "free market ideology".<ref>[[Fred L.

Neoliberalism is also, according to some scholars, commonly used as a [[pejorative]] by critics, outpacing similar terms such as [[monetarism]], [[neoconservatism]], the [[Washington Consensus]] and "market reform" in much scholarly writing.<ref name="Boas2009" /> ''The Handbook of Neoliberalism'', for instance, posits that the term has "become a means of identifying a seemingly ubiquitous set of market-oriented policies as being largely responsible for a wide range of social, political, ecological and economic problems".<ref name="Handbook2"/> Its use in this manner is controversial<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/neoliberalism-making-a-boogeyman-out-of-a-buzzword/|title=Neoliberalism: Making a Boogeyman Out of a Buzzword {{!}} Max Borders|last=Borders|first=Max|date=2015-06-26|access-date=2017-01-24|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://reason.com/archives/2001/07/01/global-village-or-global-pilla|title=Global Village or Global Pillage?|date=2001-07-01|newspaper=Reason.com|access-date=2017-01-24|language=en}}</ref> and has been especially criticized by those who advocate for policies characterized as neoliberal.<ref name="kotz" />{{rp|74}} The ''Handbook'', for example, further argues that "such lack of specificity [for the term] reduces its capacity as an analytic frame.

The [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, which severely decreased [[economic output]] throughout the world and produced high [[unemployment]] and widespread [[poverty]], was widely regarded as a failure of [[economic liberalism]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=van Otten |first1=George |title=The End of Economic Liberalism |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog597i_02/node/767 |website=GEOG 597i: Critical Geospatial Thinking and Applications |publisher=Penn State Department of Geography |accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref> To renew the damaged ideology, a group of 25 liberal intellectuals, including a number of prominent academics and journalists like [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Wilhelm Röpke]], [[Alexander Rüstow]], and [[Louis Rougier]], organized the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann|Walter Lippmann Colloquium]], named in honor of Lippman to celebrate the publication of the French translation of Lippmann’s pro-[[Market (economics)|market]] book ''An Inquiry into the Principles of the Good Society''.<ref name="NR-Colloqium">{{cite news |last1=Solow |first1=Robert M. |title=Hayek, Friedman, and the Illusions of Conservative Economics |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/110196/hayek-friedman-and-the-illusions-conservative-economics |accessdate=14 August 2019 |publisher=The New Republic |date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Burgin|first=Angus|title=The Great Persuasion: Reinventing Free Markets since the Depression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnZ1qKdXojoC&pg=PA58|date=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06743-1|page=58–62}}</ref> Meeting in Paris in August 1938, they called for a new liberal project, with "neoliberalism" one name floated for the fledgling movement.<ref name="Hartwich">[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}</ref>{{rp|18–19}} They further agreed to develop the Colloquium into a permanent think tank based in Paris called the Centre International d'Études pour la Rénovation du Libéralisme.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burgin|first=Angus|title=The Great Persuasion: Reinventing Free Markets since the Depression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnZ1qKdXojoC&pg=PA56|date=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06743-1|page=56}}</ref>

While most agreed that the ''[[status quo]]'' liberalism promoting ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics had failed, deep disagreements arose around the proper role of the [[Government|state]]. A group of "true (third way) neoliberals" centered around Rüstow and Lippmann advocated for strong state supervision of the economy while a group of old school liberals centered around Mises and Hayek continued to insist that the only legitimate role for the state was to abolish barriers to market entry. Rüstow wrote that Hayek and Mises were relics of the liberalism that caused the Great Depression while Mises denounced the other faction, complaining that the [[ordoliberalism]] they advocated really meant "ordo-interventionism".<ref name="Hartwich"/>{{rp|19–20}}

Divided in opinion and short on funding, the Colloquium was mostly ineffectual; related attempts to further neoliberal ideas, such as the effort by Colloque-attendee [[Wilhelm Röpke]] to establish a journal of neoliberal ideas, mostly floundered.<ref name="NR-Colloqium"/> Fatefully, the efforts of the Colloquium would be overwhelmed by the outbreak of [[World War II]] and were largely forgotten.<ref name="JACKSON p=129">{{closed access}} {{cite journal | last=Jackson | first=Ben | title=At the Origins of Neo-Liberalism: The Free Economy and the Strong State, 1930–1947 | journal=The Historical Journal | volume=53 | issue=1 | date=2010-01-29 | issn=0018-246X | doi=10.1017/s0018246x09990392  | pages=129–51}}</ref> However, the Colloquium did serve as the first meeting of the nascent "neoliberal" movement and would serve as the precursor to the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], a far more successful effort created after the war by many of those who had been present at the Colloquium.<ref name=Masters/>

===Mont Pelerin Society===
Neoliberalism began accelerating in importance with the establishment of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] in 1947, whose founding members included [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Karl Popper]], [[George Stigler]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Meeting annually, it would become a "kind of international 'who's who' of the classical liberal and neo-liberal intellectuals."<ref>[[George H. Nash]], ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945'', Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1976, {{ISBN|978-1-882926-12-1}}, pp. 26–27</ref> While the first conference in 1947 was almost half American, the Europeans dominated by 1951. Europe would remain the epicenter of the community as Europeans dominated the leadership roles.<ref name="mirowski"/>{{rp|16–17}} 

Established during a time when [[central planning]] was in the ascendancy worldwide and there were few avenues for neoliberals to influence policymakers, the society became a "rallying point" for neoliberals, as Milton Friedman phrased it, bringing together isolated advocates of liberalism and [[capitalism]]. They were united in their belief that individual freedom in the developed world was under threat from collectivist trends,<ref name=Masters/> which they outlined in their statement of aims:
<blockquote>
"The central values of civilization are in danger.  Over large stretches of the Earth’s surface the essential conditions of human dignity and freedom have already disappeared.  In others, they are under constant menace from the development of current tendencies of policy.  The position of the individual and the voluntary group are progressively undermined by extensions of arbitrary power.  Even that most precious possession of Western Man, freedom of thought and expression, is threatened by the spread of creeds which, claiming the privilege of tolerance when in the position of a minority, seek only to establish a position of power in which they can suppress and obliterate all views but their own...The group holds that these developments...have been fostered by a decline of belief in private property and the competitive market...[This group's] object is solely, by facilitating the exchange of views among minds inspired by certain ideals and broad conceptions held in common, to contribute to the preservation and improvement of the free society."<ref>{{cite web |title=Statement of Aims |url=https://www.montpelerin.org/statement-of-aims/ |website=The Mont Pelerin Society |accessdate=16 July 2019 |date=8 April 1947}}</ref>
</blockquote>

The society set out to develop a neoliberal alternative to, on the one hand, the [[laissez-faire]] economic consensus that had collapsed with the [[Great Depression]] and, on the other, [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]], collectivist trends which they believed posed a threat to individual freedom.<ref name=Masters/> They believed that classical liberalism had failed because of crippling conceptual flaws which could only be diagnosed and rectified by withdrawing into an intensive discussion group of similarly minded intellectuals;<ref name="mirowski"/>{{rp|16}} however, they were determined that the liberal focus on [[individualism]] and [[economic freedom]] must not be abandoned to collectivism.<ref>{{cite news |title=The birth of neoliberalism |url=https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2012/10/13/new-brooms |accessdate=25 July 2019 |publisher=The Economist |date=13 October 2012}}</ref>

==Post–World War II neoliberal currents==
For decades after the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], the ideas of the society would remain largely on the fringes of political policy, confined to a number of think-tanks and universities<ref name="harvey1"/>{{rp|40}} and achieving only measured success with the [[ordoliberal]]s in [[Germany]], who maintained the need for strong state influence in the economy. It would not be until a succession of economic downturns and crises in the 1970s that neoliberal policy proposals would be widely implemented.

By this time, however, neoliberal thought had evolved. The early neoliberal ideas of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] had sought to chart a middle way between the trend of increasing government intervention implemented after the [[Great Depression]] and the [[laissez-faire]] economics many in the society believed had produced the Great Depression. For instance, [[Milton Friedman]], one of the most influential neoliberal figures, wrote in his early essay "Neo-liberalism and Its Prospects": "Neo-liberalism would accept the nineteenth-century liberal emphasis on the fundamental importance of the individual, but it would substitute for the nineteenth century goal of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' as a means to this end, the goal of the competitive order", which requires limited state intervention to "police the system, establish conditions favorable to competition and [[United States antitrust law |prevent monopoly]], provide a stable [[Central bank|monetary framework]], and relieve acute misery and distress".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Friedman |first1=Milton |title=Neo-Liberalism and Its Prospects |url=https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 |accessdate=25 July 2019 |publisher=Farmand |date=17 February 1951}}</ref> By the 1970s, however, neoliberal thought—including Friedman's—focused almost exclusively on [[market liberalization]] and was adamant in its opposition to nearly all forms of state interference in the economy.<ref name=Masters/>

One of the earliest and most influential turns to neoliberal reform occurred in [[Chile]] after an economic crisis in the early 1970s. After less than 3 years of [[socialist]] economic policies under president [[Salvador Allende]], a [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 ''coup d'état'']] that established a [[military junta]] under dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] led to the implementation of a number of sweeping neoliberal economic reforms that had been proposed by the [[Chicago Boys]], a group of Chilean economists educated under [[Milton Friedman]]. This "neoliberal project" served as "the first experiment with neoliberal state formation" and provided an example for neoliberal reforms elsewhere.<ref name="harvey1"/>{{rp|7}} Beginning in the early 1980s, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] and [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] implemented a series of neoliberal economic reforms to counter the chronic [[stagflation]] the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] had each experienced throughout the 1970s. Neoliberal policies would continue to dominate American and British politics until the [[2008 financial crisis]].<ref name=Masters/> Following British and American reform, neoliberal policies were exported abroad, with countries in [[Latin America]], the [[Asia-Pacific]], the [[Middle East]], and even [[Communism|communist]] [[China]] implementing significant neoliberal reform. Additionally, the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] encouraged neoliberal reforms in many [[developing countries]] by placing reform requirements on loans, in a process known as [[structural adjustment]].<ref name="harvey1"/>{{rp|29}}

===Germany===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F015320-0010, Ludwig Erhard.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Ludwig Erhard]]]]

Neoliberal ideas were first implemented in [[West Germany]]. The economists around [[Ludwig Erhard]] drew on the theories they had developed in the 1930s and 1940s and contributed to West Germany's reconstruction after the Second World War.<ref>[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf ''Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword''], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}, p. 22.</ref> Erhard was a member of the Mont Pelerin Society and in constant contact with other neoliberals. He pointed out that he is commonly classified as neoliberal and that he accepted this classification.<ref>Ludwig Erhard, [http://www.franz-oppenheimer.de/le64a.htm "Franz Oppenheimer, dem Lehrer und Freund"], In: Ludwig Erhard, ''Gedanken aus fünf Jahrzehnten, Reden und Schriften'', hrsg. v. Karl Hohmann, Düsseldorf u. a. 1988, S. 861, Rede zu Oppenheimers 100. Geburtstag, gehalten in der Freien Universität Berlin (1964). {{isbn|9783430125390}}.</ref>

The [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] [[Freiburg School]] was more pragmatic. The German neoliberals accepted the classical liberal notion that competition drives economic prosperity, but they argued that a laissez-faire state policy stifles competition, as the strong devour the weak since monopolies and cartels could pose a threat to freedom of competition. They supported the creation of a well-developed legal system and capable regulatory apparatus. While still opposed to full-scale Keynesian employment policies or an extensive [[welfare state]], German neoliberal theory was marked by the willingness to place [[Humanistic capitalism|humanistic]] and social values on par with economic efficiency. [[Alfred Müller-Armack]] coined the phrase "social market economy" to emphasize the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and humanistic bent of the idea.<ref name=Boas2009/> According to Boas and Gans-Morse, [[Walter Eucken]] stated that "social security and social justice are the greatest concerns of our time".<ref name=Boas2009/>

[[File:Marshallplanhilfe.gif|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Builders in [[West Berlin]], 1952]]

Erhard emphasized that the market was inherently social and did not need to be made so.<ref name="Hartwich"/> He hoped that growing prosperity would enable the population to manage much of their social security by self-reliance and end the necessity for a widespread welfare state. By the name of ''Volkskapitalismus'', there were some efforts to foster private savings. However, although average contributions to the public old age insurance were quite small, it remained by far the most important old age income source for a majority of the German population, therefore despite liberal rhetoric the 1950s witnessed what has been called a "reluctant expansion of the welfare state". To end widespread poverty among the elderly the pension reform of 1957 brought a significant extension of the German welfare state which already had been established under [[Otto von Bismarck]].<ref>Werner Abelshauser, ''Deutsche Wirtschaftsgeschichte seit 1945'', C.H. Beck, 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-406-510946}}, Seite 192</ref> Rüstow, who had coined the label "neoliberalism", criticized that development tendency and pressed for a more limited welfare program.<ref name="Hartwich"/>

Hayek did not like the expression "social market economy", but stated in 1976 that some of his friends in Germany had succeeded in implementing the sort of social order for which he was pleading while using that phrase. However, in Hayek's view the social market economy's aiming for both a market economy and [[social justice]] was a muddle of inconsistent aims.<ref>Josef Drexl, ''Die wirtschaftliche Selbstbestimmung des Verbrauchers'', J.C.B. Mohr, 1998, {{ISBN|3-16-146938-0}}, Abschnitt: Freiheitssicherung auch gegen den Sozialstaat, p. 144.</ref> Despite his controversies with the German neoliberals at the Mont Pelerin Society, [[Ludwig von Mises]] stated that Erhard and Müller-Armack accomplished a great act of liberalism to restore the German economy and called this "a lesson for the US".<ref>Ralf Ptak, Vom Ordoliberalismus zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft: Stationen des Neoliberalismus in Deutschland, 2004, pp. 18–19</ref> However, according to different research Mises believed that the ordoliberals were hardly better than socialists. As an answer to Hans Hellwig's complaints about the interventionist excesses of the Erhard ministry and the ordoliberals, Mises wrote: "I have no illusions about the true character of the politics and politicians of the social market economy". According to Mises, Erhard's teacher [[Franz Oppenheimer]] "taught more or less the [[New Frontier]] line of" [[John F Kennedy|President Kennedy's]] "Harvard consultants ([[Arthur M. Schlesinger|Schlesinger]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith]], etc.)".<ref>Guido Jorg Hulsmann, Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism, {{ISBN|978-1933550183}}, pp. 1007–08</ref>

In Germany, neoliberalism at first was synonymous with both ordoliberalism and social market economy. But over time the original term neoliberalism gradually disappeared since social market economy was a much more positive term and fit better into the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' (economic miracle) mentality of the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name="Hartwich" />

====Chile====
{{further|Crisis of 1982|Miracle of Chile|2019 Chilean protests}}
Chile was among the earliest nations to implement neoliberal reform. [[Marxism|Marxist]] economic geographer [[David Harvey]] has described the substantial neoliberal reforms in Chile beginning in the 1970s as "the first experiment with neoliberal state formation", which would provide "helpful evidence to support the subsequent turn to neoliberalism in both Britain...and the United States."<ref name="harvey1"/>

They studied directly under [[Milton Friedman]] and his disciple, [[Arnold Harberger]], and were exposed to [[Friedrich Hayek]].

====Argentina====
{{further|José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz|Domingo Cavallo}}
In the 1960s, [[Latin America]]n intellectuals began to notice the ideas of [[ordoliberalism]]; they often used the Spanish term "neoliberalismo" to refer to this school of thought. They were particularly impressed by the [[social market economy]] and the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] ("economic miracle") in Germany and speculated about the possibility of accomplishing similar policies in their own countries. Note that neoliberalism in 1960s Argentina meant a philosophy that was more moderate than entirely [[Laissez-faire]] [[free market|free-market]] [[capitalism]] and favored using state policy to temper [[social inequality]] and counter a tendency towards monopoly.<ref name="Boas2009" />

In 1976, the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]]'s economic plan led by [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz]] was the first attempt at establishing a neoliberal program in Argentina. They implemented a fiscal [[austerity]] plan that reduced money printing in an attempt to counter inflation. In order to achieve this, salaries were frozen. However, they were unable to reduce inflation, which led to a drop in the real salary of the working class. They also liberalized trade policy so that foreign goods could freely enter the country. Argentina's industry, which had been on the rise for 20 years after the economic policies of former president [[Arturo Frondizi]], rapidly declined as it was not able to compete with foreign goods. The deregulation of the financial sector, however, lead to short-term economic growth, before rapid decline after capital fled to the United States.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Following the measures, there was an increase in poverty from 9% in 1975 to 40% at the end of 1982.<ref name=":0" />

From 1989 to 2001, more neoliberal policies were implemented by [[Domingo Cavallo]]. This time, the privatization of public services was the main focus, although financial deregulation and free trade with foreign nations were also re-implemented. Along with an increased [[labour market flexibility]], the unemployment rate dropped to 18.3%.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2005|title=Poster Child or Victim of Imperialist Globalization?

On January 1, 1994 the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista Army]] of National Liberation, named for [[Emiliano Zapata]], a leader in the Mexican revolution, launched an armed rebellion against the Mexican government in the Chiapas region.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Godelmann|first=Iker Reyes|date=July 30, 2014|title=The Zapatista Movement: The Fight for Indigenous Rights in Mexico|work=Australian Institute for International Affairs|url=http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/news-item/the-zapatista-movement-the-fight-for-indigenous-rights-in-mexico/}}</ref>  Among their demands were rights for indigenous Mexicans as well as opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which solidified a strategic alliance between state and business.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bensabat Kleinberg|first1=Remonda|year=1999|title=Strategic Alliances: State‐Business Relations in Mexico Under Neo‐Liberalism and Crisis|journal=Bulletin of Latin American Research|volume=18|issue=1|pages=71–87|doi=10.1111/j.1470-9856.1999.tb00188.x}}</ref>  NAFTA, a trade agreement between the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and Mexico, significantly aided in Mexico’s efforts to liberalize trade.

In 1994, the same year of the Zapatista rebellion and the enactment of NAFTA, Mexico faced a [[Mexican peso crisis|financial crisis]].

After Salinas, [[Ernesto Zedillo]] (1995-2000) maintained similar economic policies to his predecessor. Despite the crisis, Zedillo continued to enact neoliberal policies and signed new agreements with the [[World Bank]] and the IMF.<ref name=":6" /> As a result of these policies and the 1994 recession, Mexico’s economy did gain stability. Neither the 2001 or [[Great Recession|2008]] recessions were caused by internal economic forces in Mexico. Trade increased dramatically, as well as FDI. However, as Mexico's [[business cycle]] synced with that of the United States, it was much more vulnerable to external economic pressures.<ref name=":5" /> FDI benefited the Northern and Central regions of Mexico while the Southern region was largely excluded from the influx of investment. The crisis also left the banks mainly in the hands of foreigners.

The PRI’s 71 year rule ended when [[Vicente Fox]] of the PAN, the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]], won the election in 2000.  However, Fox and his successor [[Felipe Calderón|Calderon]] did not significantly diverge from the economic policies of the PRI governments. They continued to privatize the financial system and encourage foreign investment.<ref name=":6" /> Despite significant opposition, [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], president from 2012 to 2018, pushed through legislation that would privatize the [[Petroleum industry in Mexico|oil]] and [[Electricity sector in Mexico|electricity industries]]. These reforms marked the conclusion to the neoliberal goals that had been envisioned in Mexico in the 1980s.<ref name=":6" /> 

====Brazil====
{{Main|Economic history of Brazil}}
Brazil adopted neoliberal policies in the late 1980s, with support from the worker's party on the left. For example, tariff rates were cut from 32 percent in 1990 to 14 percent in 1994. During this period, Brazil effectively ended its policy of maintaining a closed economy focused on [[import substitution industrialization]] in favor of a more open economic system with a much higher degree of privatization. The market reforms and trade reforms ultimately resulted in price stability and a faster inflow of capital, but had little effect on income inequality and poverty. Consequently, mass protests continued during the period.<ref> Edmund Amann, and Werner Baer, "Neoliberalism and its consequences in Brazil."

Neoconservative leaders called for the enlargement, diversification, intensification, and corporatization of the farms receiving government subsidies.

Many neoliberal thinkers advance the view that economic and political freedom are inextricably linked. [[Milton Friedman]] argued in his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' that [[economic freedom]], while itself an extremely important component of [[freedom|absolute freedom]], is also a necessary condition for [[political freedom]]. He claimed that [[centrally planned economy|centralized control of economic activities]] is always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, the voluntary character of all transactions in an unregulated market economy and the wide diversity of choices that it permits pose fundamental threats to repressive political leaders by greatly diminishing their power to coerce people economically. Through the elimination of centralized control of economic activities, [[economic power]] is separated from political power and each can serve as a counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.<ref name=":1">Milton Friedman. ''Capitalism and freedom''. (2002). The University of Chicago. {{ISBN|0-226-26421-1}} pp. 8–21</ref> In ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] offered a similar argument: "Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends".<ref name="Chicago Press 1944 p.95"/> Amplifying their arguments, it has often been pointed out that increasing economic freedoms tends to raise expectations on political freedoms, eventually leading to democracy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Monetarism is often associated with the policies of the [[Federal Reserve System|US Federal Reserve]] under the [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Chairmanship]] of economist [[Paul Volcker]],<ref name="harvey1"/> which centered around high interest rates that are widely credited with ending the high levels of inflation seen in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hutchinson |first1=Martin |title=To Treat the Fed as Volcker Did |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/business/05views.html |accessdate=8 July 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=4 November 2008}}</ref> as well as contributing to the [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|1980–1982 recession]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Paul Volcker |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Adolph-Volcker |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> Monetarism had particular force in Chile, whose central bank raised interest rates to counter inflation that had spiraled to over 600%.<ref name=":4"/> This helped to successfully reduce inflation to below 10%,<ref name=":4"/> but also resulted in job losses.

A 2016 report by researchers at the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) was critical of neoliberal policies for increasing economic inequality.<ref name="Ostry2016"/> While the report included praise for neoliberalism, saying "there is much to cheer in the neoliberal agenda," it noted that certain neoliberal policies, particularly freedom of capital and fiscal consolidation, resulted in "increasing [[economic inequality|inequality]]," which "in turn jeopardized durable [economic] expansion". The report contends that the implementation of neoliberal policies by economic and political [[elite]]s has led to "three disquieting conclusions":
* The benefits in terms of increased [[economic growth|growth]] seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.
* The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and [[equity (economics)|equity]] effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.
* Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/imf-neoliberalism-warnings-2016-5 IMF: The last generation of economic policies may have been a complete failure].

[[Marxism|Marxist]] economic geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] describes neoliberalism as a "[[social class|class]] project" "carried out by the corporate capitalist class", and argued in his book ''A Brief History of Neoliberalism'' that neoliberalism is designed to increase the class power of economic [[elite]]s.<ref name=Harvey-Jacobin>{{cite news |last1=Harvey |first1=David |last2=Risager |first2=Bjarke Skærlund |title=Neoliberalism Is a Political Project |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/07/david-harvey-neoliberalism-capitalism-labor-crisis-resistance/ |accessdate=6 July 2019 |publisher=Jacobin |date=23 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="DavidHarvey">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkWWMOzNNrQ |title=A Brief History of Neoliberalism 1/5 |last=Harvey |first=David |author-link=David Harvey (geographer) |website=YouTube |series=A Brief History of Neoliberalism |access-date=2018-07-07}} Also see {{YouTube|playlist=PLA27CFAD836E1638A|title=David Harvey : A Brief History of Neoliberalism}}.</ref><ref name="harvey1"/> Economists [[Gérard Duménil]] and Dominique Lévy posit that "the restoration and increase of the power, income, and wealth of the upper classes" are the primary objectives of the neoliberal agenda.<ref name="Duménil Lévy 2016 p. 551">{{cite book |first1=Gérard |last1=Duménil |author-link=Gérard Duménil |first2=Dominique |last2=Lévy |editor-last=Springer |editor-first=Simon |editor-last2=Birch |editor-first2=Kean |editor-last3=MacLeavy |editor-first3=Julie |title=The handbook of neoliberalism |publisher=Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group |location=New York & London |year=2016 |isbn=978-1317549666  |oclc=953604193 |chapter=The crisis of neoliberalism |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZmkDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT645 |pages=551–557 |access-date=2018-07-07}}</ref> Economist David M.

In expanding upon Wacquant's thesis, sociologist and political economist John L. Campbell of [[Dartmouth College]] suggests that through [[Private prison|privatization]] the prison system exemplifies the centaur state. He states that "on the one hand, it punishes the lower class, which populates the prisons; on the other hand, it profits the upper class, which owns the prisons, and it employs the middle class, which runs them." In addition, he argues that the prison system benefits corporations through outsourcing, as inmates are "slowly becoming a source of low-wage labor for some US corporations". Both through privatization and outsourcing, Campbell argues, the penal state reflects neoliberalism.<ref name="campbell">{{cite journal |title= Neoliberalism's penal and debtor states |author=[http://dartmouth.edu/faculty-directory/john-l-campbell John L.

Ramaa Vasudevan, associate professor of economics at Colorado State University, states that trade policies and treaties fostered by the United States in the neoliberal era, along with bailouts brokered by the World Bank and the IMF, have allowed corporate capital to expand around the world unimpeded by trade protections or national borders, "sucking countries in different regions of the world into global corporations' logic of accumulation." This expansion of global corporate capital, Vasudevan says, has buttressed its ability to "orchestrate a global division of labor most conducive to the demands of profitability" which in turn has facilitated "a brutal, global [[race to the bottom]]."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vasudevan|first=Ramaa|date=2019|title=The Global Class War|journal=Catalyst|volume=3|issue=1|pages=113, 129|issn=2475-7365}}</ref>

Mark Arthur, a Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development Research in Denmark, has written that the influence of neoliberalism has given rise to an "[[anti-corporatists|anti-corporatist]]" movement in opposition to it. This "anti-corporatist" movement is articulated around the need to reclaim the power that corporations and global institutions have stripped from governments. He says that [[Adam Smith]]'s "rules for mindful markets" served as a basis for the anti-corporate movement, "following government's failure to restrain corporations from hurting or disturbing the happiness of the neighbor [Smith]".<ref>Struggle and the Prospects for World Government.

Geographer [[David Harvey]] argues neoliberalism encourages an indirect form of imperialism that focuses on the extraction of resources from developing countries via financial mechanisms.<ref name="harvey1"/>{{rp|73–74}} This is practiced through international institutions like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]] who negotiate debt relief with developing nations. He alleges that these institutions prioritize the financial institutions that grant the loans over the debtor countries and place requirements on loans that, in effect, act as financial flows from debtor countries to developed countries (for example, to receive a loan a state must have sufficient foreign exchange reserves—requiring the debtor state to buy US Treasury bonds, which have interest rates lower than those on the loan). Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] has said of this: "What a peculiar world in which poor countries are in effect subsidizing the richest."<ref name="harvey1"/>{{rp|74}}

The neoliberal approach to global health advocates [[privatization]] of the [[healthcare industry]] and [[deregulation|reduced government interference]] in the market, and focuses on [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and international organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] rather than government.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=James|date=17 September 2016|title='Blind Spot: How Neoliberalism Infiltrated Global Health' Book Review|url=https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article-pdf/38/3/624/8518513/fdv082.pdf|journal=Journal of Public Health|volume=38|issue=3|pages=624|doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdv082}}</ref> This approach has faced considerable criticism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Baru|first1=Rama|last2=Mohan|first2=Malu|date=9 October 2018|title=Globalisation and neoliberalism as structural drivers of health inequities|journal=Health Research Policy and Systems|volume=16|issue=Suppl 1|pages=91|doi=10.1186/s12961-018-0365-2|pmid=30301457|pmc=6178247}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=The Deadly Ideas of Neoliberalism: How the IMF has Undermined Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS|last=Rowden|first=Rick|publisher=Zed Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1848132856|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Blind Spot: How Neoliberalism Infiltrated Global Health|last=Keshavjee|first=Salmaan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2014|isbn=9780520282841}}</ref> James Pfeiffer, Professor of Global Health at the [[University of Washington]], has criticised the use of [[Structural adjustment|Structural Adjustment Programs]] (SAPs) by the World Bank and IMF in [[Mozambique]], which resulted in reduced government health spending, leading international NGOs to fill service holes previously filled by government.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pfeiffer|first1=J|year=2003|title=International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a new model of collaboration|journal=Social Science & Medicine|volume=56|issue=4|pages=725–38|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00068-0|pmid=12560007}}</ref> He alleges this "new policy agenda" fragmented local health systems, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to [[social inequality]]. Rick Rowden, a Senior Economist at Global Financial Integrity, has criticised the IMF's [[monetarism|monetarist]] approach of prioritising [[price stability]] and fiscal restraint, which he alleges was unnecessarily restrictive and prevented developing countries from scaling up long-term [[investment]] in public health infrastructure.<ref name=":3" /> He argues this resulted in chronically underfunded public health systems and demoralising working conditions, which fueled a [[brain drain]] of medical personnel and undermined the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]], as well as public health more generally, in developing countries.

Some academics and commentators have blamed neoliberalism and hyper-capitalism for exacerbating and normalizing the social ills and violence of contemporary society,<ref name="Berdayes">{{cite book|editor1-last=Berdayes|editor1-first=Vicente|editor2-last=Murphy |editor2-first=John W.|date=2016 |title=Neoliberalism, Economic Radicalism, and the Normalization of Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G64vCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2|publisher=Springer |page=2 |isbn=978-3-319-25169-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Collins|first1=Victoria E.|last2= Rothe|first2=Dawn L.|date=2019 |title=The Violence of Neoliberalism: Crime, Harm and Inequality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=us2gDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT11|page=11|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781138584778}}</ref> including the increase in [[mass shootings]],<ref name="Berdayes"/><ref>{{cite news |last= McIntyre|first=Niamh|date=April 16, 2015 |title=This Theorist Believes That Capitalism Creates Mass Murderers by Causing People to 'Malfunction'|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wd7eyw/berardi-interview|work=Vice |access-date=August 11, 2019 }}</ref> particularly [[Mass shootings in the United States|in the United States]].<ref>{{cite news |last1= Wolff|first1=Richard D.|last2= Fraad|first2=Harriet|date=November 8, 2017 |title=American hyper-capitalism breeds the lonely, alienated men who become mass killers|url=https://www.salon.com/2017/11/08/american-hyper-capitalism-breeds-the-lonely-alienated-men-who-become-mass-killers_partner/|work=Salon |access-date=August 11, 2019|author-link1=Richard D.

===Infrastructure===
Nicolas Firzli has argued that the rise of neoliberalism eroded the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower-era Republican centrism]] that had resulted in the massive allocation of public capital to large-scale infrastructure projects throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s in both [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]]: "In the pre-Reagan era, infrastructure was an apolitical, positively connoted, technocratic term shared by mainstream economists and policy makers […] including President Eisenhower, a praetorian Republican leader who had championed investment in the Interstate Highway System, America's national road grid […] But Reagan, Thatcher, Delors and their many admirers amongst Clintonian, "[[New Labour]]" and EU Social-Democrat decision makers in Brussels sought to dismantle the generous state subsidies for social infrastructure and public transportation across the United States, Britain and the European Union".<ref>Nicolas J. Firzli, [https://www.academia.edu/26978017/After_The_Neoliberals_A_New_Middle_Way_for_Britain_and_America_Rescuing_Native_Workers_and_Jumpstarting_the_Economy/ The End of 'Globalization'? Economic Policy in the Post-Neocon Age], ''Revue Analyse Financière'' (July 12, 2016).</ref>

Following [[Brexit]], the [[2016 United States presidential election]] and the progressive emergence of a new kind of "self-seeking capitalism" ("[[wikt:Trumponomics|Trumponomics]]") moving away to some extent from the neoliberal orthodoxies of the past, there is speculation that the United States, Britain, and other advanced economies may see increases in infrastructure investment:<ref>Jeremy Weltman : [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1157nr86h8byh/country-risk-review-2016-populism-is-risky "Country Risk Review: Populism Is Risky", Euromoney Global Capital, January 6 2017]</ref><ref>M. Nicolas J. Firzli : [https://www.academia.edu/26978017/After_The_Neoliberals_A_New_Middle_Way_for_Britain_and_America_Rescuing_Native_Workers_and_Jumpstarting_the_Economy "The End of Globalization? Economic Policy in the Post-Neocon Age", Revue Analyse Financière, Q3 2016 – Issue N°60]</ref> <blockquote>With the victory of [[Donald Trump|Donald J. Trump]] on November 8, 2016, the 'neoliberal-neoconservative' policy consensus that had crystallized in 1979–1980 (Deng Xiaoping's visit to the United States, election of Reagan and Thatcher) finally came to an end [...] The deliberate neglect of America's creaking infrastructure assets (notably public transportation and water sanitation) from the early 1980s on eventually fueled a widespread popular discontent that came back to haunt both [[Hillary Clinton]] and the Republican establishment. Donald Trump was quick to seize on the issue to make a broader slap against the ''laissez-faire'' complacency of the federal government.<ref>M. Nicolas J. Firzli : [http://www.analysefinanciere.org/2017/01/26/understanding-trumponomics 'Understanding Trumponomics', Revue Analyse Financière, 26 January 2017 – Supplement to Issue N°62]</ref></blockquote>

Others, such as Catherine Rottenberg, do not see Trump's victory as an end to neoliberalism, but rather a new phase of it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/12/trumping-neoliberalism-steroids-161215144834626.html|title=Trumping it up: Neoliberalism on steroids|last= Rottenberg|first=Catherine|date=December 18, 2016 |website=Al Jazeera|access-date= April 20, 2017}}</ref> American political theologian [[Adam Kotsko]] argues that contemporary right-wing populism, exemplified by Brexit and the [[Trump Administration]], represent a "heretical" variant of neoliberalism, which accepts its core tenets but pushes them to new, almost "parodic" extremes.<ref>{{cite book |last= Kotsko|first=Adam|date=2018 |title=Neoliberalism's Demons: On the Political Theology of Late Capital|url=https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=29538|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|isbn=978-1503607125|page=10|author-link=Adam Kotsko}}</ref>

===Environmental impact===
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Press conference EU-Mercosul on June 26, 2019 (VII).jpg|thumb|The [[European Union–Mercosur free trade agreement]], which would form one of the world's largest [[free trade]] areas, has been denounced by environmental activists and indigenous rights campaigners.]]
It has been argued that trade-led, unregulated economic activity and lax state [[regulation of pollution]] have led to [[environmental degradation]].<ref>Peet, Richard. "Neoliberalism and Nature: The Case of the WTO". Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol 590 November 2003: 188–211.</ref> Furthermore, modes of production encouraged under neoliberalism may reduce the availability of natural resources over the long term, and may therefore not be sustainable within the world's [[resource depletion|limited geographical space]].<ref>Moore, Jason W. (2011) 'Transcending the metabolic rift: a theory of crises in the capitalist worldecology', Journal of Peasant Studies, 38: 1, 1–46</ref>

[[Marxism|Marxist]] economic geographer [[David Harvey]] argues neoliberalism is to blame for [[Holocene extinction|increased rates of extinction]].<ref name="harvey1"/>{{rp|173}} Notably, he observes that "the era of neoliberalization also happens to be the era of the fastest mass extinction of species in the Earth's recent history." American philosopher and animal rights activist [[Steven Best]] argues that three decades of neoliberal policies have "marketized the entire world" and intensified "the assault on every ecosystem on the earth as a whole".<ref>{{cite book |last= Best|first=Steven|date=2014 |title=The Politics of Total Liberation: Revolution for the 21st Century|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|page=160 |isbn=978-1137471116|author-link=Steven Best}}</ref>

The [[Friedman doctrine]], which Nicolas Firzli has argued defined the neoliberal era,<ref name="Analyse Financière">{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth? |url= https://www.academia.edu/28982570 |accessdate=1 November 2016 |work=Analyse Financière|date=October 2016}}</ref> may lead companies to neglect concerns for the environment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} Firzli insists that prudent, [[fiduciary]]-driven long-term investors cannot ignore the [[environmental, social and corporate governance]] consequences of actions taken by the CEOs of the companies whose shares they hold as "the long-dominant Friedman stance is becoming culturally unacceptable and financially costly in the boardrooms of pension funds and industrial firms in Europe and North America".<ref name="Analyse Financière"/>

===Political opposition===
Neoliberalism has given rise to many instances of political opposition:
* The rise of anti-austerity parties in Europe and [[SYRIZA]]'s victory in the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|Greek legislative elections of January 2015]] have some proclaiming "the end of neoliberalism".<ref>Paul Mason (25 January 2015). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/25/greece-shows-what-can-happen-when-young-revolt-against-corrupt-elites Greece shows what can happen when the young revolt against corrupt elites]. ''[[The Guardian]].'' Retrieved 25 January 2015.</ref>
* In Latin America, the "[[pink tide]]" that swept leftist governments into power at the turn of the millennium can be seen as a reaction against neoliberal hegemony and the notion that "[[there is no alternative]]" (TINA) to the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Neoliberal Hegemony and the Pink Tide in Latin America: Breaking Up With TINA? (International Political Economy Series)|last=Chodor|first=Tom|year=2014|isbn=978-1137444677|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/neoliberal-hegemony-and-the-pink-tide-in-latin-america-tom-chodor/?K=9781137444677|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]}}</ref>
* In protest against neoliberal globalization, South Korean farmer and former president of the Korean Advanced Farmers Federation [[Lee Kyung-hae]] committed suicide by stabbing himself in the heart during a meeting of the [[World Trade Organization]] in Cancun, Mexico in 2003.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last= Frye|editor1-first=Joshua|editor2-last= Bruner|editor2-first=Michael|date=2013 |title=The Rhetoric of Food: Discourse, Materiality, and Power |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IR9woMrfFs4C&pg=PA147|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page= 147|isbn=978-0415727563}}</ref> He was protesting against the decision of the South Korean government to reduce subsidies to farmers.<ref name = "For Business Ethics"/>{{rp|96}}
* Research by [[Kristen Ghodsee]], ethnographer and Professor of Russian and East European Studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], shows that widespread discontent with neoliberal capitalism has led to a "[[Communist nostalgia|red nostalgia]]" in much of the former Communist bloc. She notes that "the political freedoms that came with democracy were packaged with the worst type of unregulated, free-market capitalism, which completely destabilized the rhythms of everyday life and brought crime, corruption and chaos where there had once been comfortable predictability,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wamc.org/post/dr-kristen-ghodsee-bowdoin-college-nostalgia-communism|title=Dr. Kristen Ghodsee, Bowdoin College – Nostalgia for Communism|publisher=Wamc.org|date=2011-11-01|accessdate=2018-07-26}}</ref> which ultimately fueled a resurgence of extremist [[nationalism]].<ref name="Ghodsee2017"/>
*In the late 2010s, various protest movements, such as the [[Yellow vests movement]] in France and the [[2019–2020 Chilean protests]], have emerged in direct opposition to neoliberal governments and policies including [[privatization]] and [[austerity]], which are blamed for the rising [[cost of living]], surging personal debts, and increased [[economic inequality]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Haskins
