The '''Abortion Legislation Act 2020''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] in [[New Zealand]] that amends the law to decriminalise abortion. Under the act, abortion is available without restrictions to any woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant. Women seeking an abortion after 20 weeks have to be assessed by a qualified health professional.<ref name="Bill Digest">{{cite web |title=Abortion Legislation Bill 2019 164-1: Bill Digest |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-digests/document/52PLLaw25991/abortion-legislation-bill-2019-bills-digest-2599 |publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref>

==Legislative features==
The Abortion Legislation Act decriminalises abortion, better aligns the regulation of abortion services with other health services, and modernises the legal framework of abortion provided by the [[Crimes Act 1961]] and the [[Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977]] (CSA Act 1977). The Abortion Legislation Act repeals Sections 10 to 46 of the CSA Act 1977 including the Abortion Supervisory Committee (Section 10), the requirement that abortions need to be certified by two certifying consultants (Section 29), and the ban on women unlawfully procuring a miscarriage (Section 44). Under the Abortion Legislation Act, women can seek an abortion without restrictions within the first 20 weeks of their pregnancy. After the 20 week period, women seeking an abortion must consult a qualified health practitioner who will assess the patient's physical health, mental health, and well-being.<ref name="Bill Digest" />

The Act also requires medical practitioners who have a [[conscientious objection to abortion|conscientious objection]] to performing abortions to inform their patients at the earliest opportunity and to provide them with information on how to access the closest abortion services. The Act also contains provisions for protecting the rights of conscientious objecting medical professionals from discrimination and termination.<ref name="Bill Digest" />

The Abortion Legislation Act also amends section 182 of the Crimes Act (killing an unborn child) to exempt abortion services within the provisions of the CSA Act. The Act also repeals Sections 183 to 187A of the Crimes Act including the 14 year prison term for any persons with the exception of the woman or girl seeking to unlawfully procure abortion (section 183); a seven year prison term for persons who unlawfully provide the means of procuring an abortion (section 186), and seeking an abortion illegally before or after the 20 week gestation period (section 187). The Abortion Legislation Act replaces these sections with section 183 (clause 12) which makes it an offense for a person who is not a health practitioner to procure or perform an abortion for a woman.<ref name="Bill Digest" />

The Abortion Legislation Act also extends the definition of health services in the [[Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994]] (HDC Act) to include abortion services.<ref name="Bill Digest" />

==History==
[[File:Andrew Little 2019 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|175px|Andrew Little, the sponsor of the Abortion Legislation Act.]]
===Background===
On 5 August 2019, the [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Minister of Justice]] [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] announced that the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-led coalition government]] would be introducing new legislation to decriminalise abortion and to allow women unrestricted access to abortion within the 20 week gestation period. The [[New Zealand Law Commission]] had proposed three options for abortion reform: having no statutory test to make sure the abortion was appropriate at any point; taking abortion off the Crimes Act but having a statutory test; or only having a test for later-term abortions, after 22 weeks. The Government adopted the third approach but reduced it to 20 weeks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Little |first1=Andrew |title=Bill to modernise abortion law introduced |url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/bill-modernise-abortion-law-introduced |website=Beehive.govt.nz |publisher=[[New Zealand Government]] |accessdate=6 August 2019 |date=5 August 2019}}</ref><ref name="ODT 5 August 2019">{{cite news |title=Govt unveils sweeping abortion law changes |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/govt-unveils-sweeping-abortion-law-changes |accessdate=5 August 2019 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=5 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Whyte |first1=Anna |title=New Government bill seeks to remove abortion from Crimes Act, treat it as a health issue |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/new-government-bill-seeks-remove-abortion-crimes-act-treat-health-issue |accessdate=5 August 2019 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=5 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Jancic |first1=Boris |title=Government unveils abortion law reforms |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12255624 |accessdate=4 August 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=5 August 2019}}</ref> While pro-choice groups like the [[Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand]] (ALRANZ) and Family Planning have welcomed the proposed changes but criticized the 20 week limit, the Government's proposed abortion law reform was opposed by the conservative lobby group [[Family First New Zealand]].<ref name="ODT 5 August 2019" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Radical abortion law reform is deeply anti-human rights – Family First |url=http://www.voxy.co.nz/politics/5/344561 |accessdate=5 August 2019 |agency=Fuseworks Media |publisher=Voxy.com |date=5 August 2019}}</ref>

According to media reports, the ruling [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] and its coalition partner [[New Zealand First]] conducted months of negotiations on the proposed Abortion Legislation Bill. New Zealand First Member of Parliament and Minister of Children [[Tracey Martin]], a supporter of abortion reform, played an active role in the negotiations. On 6 August 2019, NZ First leader and [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Winston Peters]] surprised both Martin and Labour by demanding a binding referendum on the Abortion Legislation Bill. The NZ First parliamentary caucus voted by a majority to support their leader's calls for a referendum. In response, Justice Minister Andrew Little ruled out support for a binding referendum on abortion, claiming that it had not been discussed during the negotiations. NZ First subsequently confirmed that it would support the Abortion Legislation Bill through its first and second readings while pushing for a referendum.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Patterson |first1=Jane |title=Abortion legislation: 'It wasn't part of our coalition agreement so why is it there' – Winston Peters |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/396224/abortion-legislation-it-wasn-t-part-of-our-coalition-agreement-so-why-is-it-there-winston-peters |accessdate=8 August 2019 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=8 August 2019}}</ref><ref name="NZ First blindsides Andrew Little">{{cite news |last1=Jancic |first1=Boris |title=NZ First blindsides Andrew Little with talk of abortion referendum |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12256174 |accessdate=7 August 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Walls |first1=Jason |title=All nine NZ First MPs to vote in favour of abortion bill in first and second reading |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12256917 |accessdate=8 August 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=8 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Henry |title=Winston Peters suggests NZ First want binding referendum on abortion |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/114790808/winston-peters-suggests-nz-first-want-binding-referendum-on-abortion |accessdate=7 August 2019 |publisher=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=6 August 2019}}</ref>

The opposition [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] leader [[Simon Bridges]] voiced his support for abortion reform but stated that more safeguards were needed. Voting for the Abortion Legislation Bill was conducted by a [[conscience vote]], allowing MPs to vote individually on the bill.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jancic |first1=Boris |title=National leader Simon Bridges to back abortion law changes at first reading |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12256040 |accessdate=8 August 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=8 August 2019}}</ref> Opposition National MP [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]] criticized NZ First's call for a referendum, saying that the matter should be decided by Parliament.<ref name="NZ First blindsides Andrew Little" />

On 8 August 2019, the New Zealand Parliament held its first vote on the Abortion Legislation Act, which passed by 94 votes against 23.

===Select committee stage===
[[File:Ruth Dyson, 2011.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Ruth Dyson, Chairperson of the Abortion Legislation Committee]]
Submissions for the Abortion Legislation Act were held until 19 September 2019. Labour MP [[Ruth Dyson]] was designated Chairperson of the Abortion Legislation Committee.<ref>{{cite web |title=Abortion Legislation Bill: Make a submission |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/52SCAL_SCF_BILL_89814/abortion-legislation-bill |publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] |accessdate=9 October 2019 |date=18 September 2019}}</ref> Other Committee members have included Green MP [[Jan Logie]], Labour MPs [[Priyanca Radhakrishnan]] and [[Anahila Kanongata'a-Suisuiki]], and National MPs [[Nikki Kaye]] and [[Agnes Loheni]].<ref name="Stuff 8 October 2019">{{cite news |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Matthew |title=Abortion bill: Emotions run high at select committee hearing in Auckland |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/116396137/abortion-bill-emotions-run-high-at-select-committee-hearing-in-auckland |accessdate=9 October 2019 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=8 October 2019}}</ref> By 9 October 2019, the Abortion Legislation Committee had received 25,000 written submissions from a range of legal and medical experts, religious groups, national organisations and ordinary people sharing personal experiences including Dr Alison Knowles, the Mental Health Foundation, and Family First. Due to the large volume, the Committee confirmed that it would be hearing 150 oral submissions out of the 2,890 who had opted to speak. Family First national director [[Bob McCoskrie]] criticised the select committee for excluding certain voices and rushing the process. In response, Dyson reiterated the committee's commitment to hearing a range of perspectives while remarking that "hearing the same thing over and over again doesn't add value to the committee at all." Submissions were held in [[Auckland]] on 8 October and scheduled for [[Christchurch]] on 11 October and [[Wellington]] on 15 October.<ref name="Stuff 8 October 2019" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Abortion law critics angered by handling of submissions |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12274970 |accessdate=9 October 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=9 October 2019}}</ref>

In 14 February 2020, the Select Committee delivered its report which called for safeguards to address sex selection, late-term abortions and to remove some barriers for women seeking abortions. Another recommendation was requiring a health professional approving abortion after 20 weeks to consult at least one other health professional before authorising an abortion. The definition for consultation was also widened to include Registered Nurses as well and qualified medical practitioners.<ref name="Final report">{{cite web |title=Final report: Abortion Legislation Bill |url=https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-NZ/SCR_94828/dd87c15733b01d9d26c3f7a79c8f0188ab898d3a |publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] |accessdate=24 March 2020 |date=14 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dreaver |first1=Charlie |title=Select committee delivers report on abortion Bill |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/409570/select-committee-delivers-report-on-abortion-bill |accessdate=22 February 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=14 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cheng |first1=Derek |title=Abortion law reform: Extra doctor consultation recommended for later than 20-week abortions |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12308695 |accessdate=22 February 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=14 February 2020}}</ref> In addition, Loheni published a minority report criticising the bill for what she regarded as a lack of safeguards on foetal abnormalities and late-term abortions.

===Committee of the Whole House stage===
[[File:David Seymour (cropped).jpg|left|upright|thumb|ACT Leader David Seymour, successfully moved a motion eliminating "safe zones" from the Act.]]
The Committee of the Whole House stage began on 10 March 2020. On the first day of debate on Part 1, parliamentarians narrowly rejected, by 56–59, the first part of David Seymour's amendment to scrap "safe zones" from the Act. However, the second part of Seymour's amendment, which effectively scrapped the proposed "safe zones", was passed during a voting mix-up. Parliament also adopted an amendment by Ruth Dyson dealing with [[Conscientious objection to abortion|conscientious objectors]]. In addition, Parliament considered but rejected several amendments including: 
*Green Co-Leader [[Marama Davidson]]'s amendment reducing penalties around safe zones and removing political involvement in their setting up (21–96);
*An amendment to remove all statutory tests for abortions up to birth (12–106);
*A supplementary order paper by National MP [[Parmjeet Parmar]]  aiming to prevent gender-selective abortions failed; and 
*An amendment by National MP Simon O'Connor requiring medical intervention of unintended live births after attempted termination (37–80).<ref>{{cite web |title=Abortion Legislation Bill — In Committee |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/combined/HansDeb_20200310_20200310_20 |publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] |date=10 March 2020|accessdate= 11 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Wade |first1=Amelia |title=Voting mix-up sees abortion safe-zones axed and MPs 'gutted' |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12315875 |accessdate=11 March 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=11 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=McCullough |first1=Yvette |title=MPs vote to remove abortion clinic safe zones from Bill |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/411409/mps-vote-to-remove-abortion-clinic-safe-zones-from-bill |accessdate=11 March 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=11 March 2020}}</ref>

On 18 March, parliamentarians voted against holding a referendum on the abortion law changes by margin of 100 to 19. New Zealand First had proposed a referendum on the changes in return for supporting the passage of the legislation through Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |title=Abortion referendum scrapped – public won't decide on law change |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12317689 |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Coughlan |first1=Thomas |title=Attempt to put abortion law changes to a referendum fails crucial Parliamentary vote |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/120365532/attempt-to-put-abortion-law-changes-to-a-referendum-fails-crucial-parliamentary-vote |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Small |first1=Zane |title=Lawmakers vote against putting abortion law changes to referendum |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/03/lawmakers-vote-against-putting-abortion-law-changes-to-referendum.html |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[Newshub]] |date=18 March 2020}}</ref>

===Third reading===
On the evening of 18 March, the Abortion Legislation Act passed its third reading by a margin of 68 to 51. Green MP Marama Davidson attempted to reverse David Seymour's amendment eliminating safe zones around abortion clinics but MPs voted by a margin 77 to 43 against it. During the final reading, the bill's initiator Justice Minister Little argued that it would make significant changes to the country's abortion framework by eliminating abortion from the Crimes Act. Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Justice Minister, [[Jan Logie]], hailed the bill's passage as a victory for women having the freedom to make decisions about having a child. Abortion Legislation Committee's chair Ruth Dyson and National MP [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]] welcomed the bill's passage as long overdue for women's rights but expressed disappointment at the elimination of the safe zones around abortion clinics.<ref name="RNZ 18 March">{{cite news |title=Abortion Legislation Bill passes third and final reading in Parliament |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/412087/abortion-legislation-bill-passes-third-and-final-reading-in-parliament |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=18 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330023938/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/412087/abortion-legislation-bill-passes-third-and-final-reading-in-parliament|archive-date=30 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="NZH 18 March">{{cite news |last1=Wade |first1=Amelia |title=Abortion law reform passes third reading |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12317885 |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200410085449/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12317885|archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="Newshub 18 March">{{cite news |last1=Small |first1=Zane |title=Abortion no longer a crime in New Zealand as law change passes final reading in Parliament |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/03/abortion-no-longer-a-crime-in-new-zealand-as-law-change-passes-final-reading-in-parliament.html |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=[[Newshub]] |date=18 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319032334/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/03/abortion-no-longer-a-crime-in-new-zealand-as-law-change-passes-final-reading-in-parliament.html|archive-date=19 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="Stuff 18 March" /> 

During the final reading, Labour List MP [[Kieran McAnulty]] spoke about his Catholic faith and being adopted as a child but supported women's reproductive rights. ACT Leader David Seymour expressed support for women's reproductive rights and eliminating abortion from the Crimes Act but defended his amendment to eliminate safe zones. Labour MP [[Marja Lubeck]] said that abortion was not a decision that women made lightly, describing the previous legislation as "archaic."<ref name="NZH 18 March" /><ref name="Stuff 18 March" />

Several MPs opposed to the Abortion Legislation Act also made speeches during the final reading. National MP Agnes Loheni, a member of the Abortion Legislation Committee, described the bill as an "attack on our humanity." She highlighted the fact that 91.6% of the 25,000 submissions had opposed the bill.<ref name="NZH 18 March" /><ref name="RNZ 18 March" /><ref name="Newshub 18 March" /><ref name="Stuff 18 March" /> Labour MP [[Greg O'Connor (politician)|Greg O'Connor]] expressed concerns that the Bill's Section 11 did not do enough to protect disabled infants while talking about his experiences as the father of a disabled child. National MP [[Simon O'Connor]] claimed that the bill did not afford rights and dignity to unborn children. Fellow National MP [[Andrew Bayly]] expressed concerns that the bill would allow minors to seek abortions without the knowledge of their parents and guardians. National MP [[Chris Penk]] disputed assertions that the previous abortion legislation criminalised women and claimed that the new bill would deny unborn children the right of protection under the law.<ref name="NZH 18 March" />

===Royal assent and entry into force===
The Act was given the Royal assent on 23 March,<ref name="auto"/> and came into force on 24 March.

=== Proposed amendments ===
Following the voting mix-up which saw the safe area provisions scrapped, Labour MP [[Louisa Wall]] entered the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion (Safe Areas) Amendment Bill, proposing their restoration, into the [[Private member's bill|member's bill]] ballot. The bill was drawn from the ballot on 23 July 2020 and introduced. When Parliament dissolved prior to the 17 October 2020 general election, the bill was still awaiting its first reading.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion (Safe Areas) Amendment Bill - New Zealand Parliament|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_99649/contraception-sterilisation-and-abortion-safe-areas|access-date=2020-10-27|website=www.parliament.nz|language=en}}</ref>
