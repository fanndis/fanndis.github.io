'''Francis, Duke of Teck''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|GCB|GCVO|KStJ}} (Francis Paul Charles Louis Alexander; 28 August 1837 &ndash; 21 January 1900), known as '''Count Francis von Hohenstein''' until 1863, was an Austrian-born nobleman who married into the [[British royal family]]. He was the father of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], and thus a great-grandfather of the current British monarch, [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. Francis held the Austrian title of Count of Hohenstein (''Graf von Hohenstein''), and the German titles of Prince (''[[Fürst]]'') and later [[Duke of Teck]] (''Herzog von Teck''), and was given the style of [[Serene Highness]] in 1863. He was granted the British style of [[His Highness|Highness]] in 1887.

==Background and early military career==
Francis was born on 28 August 1837 in [[Esseg]], [[Kingdom of Slavonia|Slavonia]] (now [[Osijek]], [[Croatia]]), and christened ''Franz Paul Karl Ludwig Alexander''.<ref>Huberty, M., Giraud, A., Magdelaine, F. & B. (1979) ''L’Allemagne Dynastique, Vol. II'' (Alain Giraud, Le Perreux, France) p.524 {{ISBN|2-901138-02-0}}</ref> His father was [[Duke Alexander of Württemberg (1804–1885)|Duke Alexander of Württemberg]], the son of [[Duke Louis of Württemberg]]. His mother was [[Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde]]. The marriage was [[morganatic]], meaning that Francis had no succession rights to the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]]. His title at birth was Count Francis von Hohenstein, after his mother was created Countess von Hohenstein in her own right by [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria]].

He was educated at the Imperial Austrian Academy of Engineers from 1849 to 1853 and joined the Imperial Austrian Army as a [[lieutenant]] in the 1st Lancers in 1854. He transferred to the Guard Squadron in 1858 and later became a Captain (''[[Rittmeister]]'') in the 7th Hussars. He served as Orderly Officer under [[Franz Graf von Wimpffen|Count von Wimpffen]] in Italy during the [[Austro-Sardinian War]] and was awarded the gold medal for distinguished service at the [[Battle of Solferino]] and the bronze war medal, 1859.<ref name=whowaswho>‘TECK’, ''[[Who Was Who]]'', [[A & C Black]], 1920–2008; online edn, [[Oxford University Press]], Dec 2007 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U191492, accessed 4 Jan 2012]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 1863, Francis was created Prince of Teck, with the style of ''[[Serene Highness]]'', in the Kingdom of Württemberg. He served during the [[Austro-Prussian War]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} and retired from the Austrian Army when he married and moved to England in 1866.

==Marriage and dukedom==
[[Image:Teck und Württemberg 1865.JPG|thumb|Francis, Duke of Teck, and Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck, with [[Duke Philipp of Württemberg|Duke Philipp]] and Duchess Marie Therese of Württemberg in England, around 1866]]
As the product of a [[morganatic marriage]], and without succession rights to the throne, Francis was not acceptable as a husband for princesses in most of the European royal houses.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, James; Vickers, Hugo (ed.) ''The Quest For Queen Mary'', Zulieka, 2018, p20.</ref>  Further, Francis had little income in comparison with other European princes. He thus married into a richer family, by marrying his father's third cousin (in descent from [[George II of Great Britain|King George II of Great Britain]]) [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge]], the younger daughter of [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge]], and a granddaughter of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].

The couple married on 12 June 1866 at [[St Anne's Church, Kew]], in [[Surrey]].<ref>Weir, A. (1996) ''Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy, Revised edition'' (Pimlico, London)</ref> They had one daughter and three sons:<ref name=whowaswho/>

*[[Mary of Teck|Princess Victoria Mary of Teck]] (1867–1953); later Queen Mary, consort of [[King George V]] of the United Kingdom.
*[[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Prince Adolphus of Teck]] (1868–1927); later [[Duke of Teck]] and [[Marquess of Cambridge]].
*[[Prince Francis of Teck]] (1870–1910).
*[[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Prince Alexander of Teck]] (1874–1957); later [[Earl of Athlone]].

He was created [[Duke of Teck]] by the [[Charles I of Württemberg|King of Württemberg]] in 1871.<ref>James Pope-Hennessy, Queen Mary, Reprint Society 1959, p 61.</ref>

==Later military career==
Teck was made  [[Colonel (United Kingdom)#Honorary Colonel|Honorary Colonel]] of the [[1st Surrey Artillery Volunteers]] on 15 June 1867 and continued as supernumerary Honorary Colonel of the [[City of London Artillery|1st City of London Artillery]] after the units merged in 1883.<ref>''Army List''.</ref><ref name=whowaswho/> He was also made Honorary Colonel of the [[49th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers]] (Post Office Rifles) on 16 August 1876.<ref>{{London Gazette|page=3714|issue=26417|date=15 August 1876}}</ref>

He was attached to the staff of British General [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Sir Garnet Wolseley]] during the  [[Urabi Revolt|Egyptian campaign]] of 1882. He received the [[Egypt Medal|silver medal]] for the [[Battle of Tel-el-Kebir]], the [[Khedive's Star]], and the [[Order of Osmanieh]], first class.<ref name=whowaswho/> On his return from Egypt he was gazetted a Colonel in the [[British Army]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=25169|page=5173|date=17 November 1882}}</ref>

The Duke of Teck was made Colonel (''[[Oberst]]'') [[à la suite]] of the [[25th (1st Württemberg) Dragoons "Queen Olga"]]<ref name=whowaswho/> on 6 March 1889, and a ''[[Generalmajor]]'' in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] on 18 October 1891.<ref name=dew>Karl Spieß and Hans Ritter, ''Geschichte des Dragoner-Regiments Königin Olga (1. Württ.) Nr. 25'' (Ludwigsburg, 1913), p. 509</ref> He was made a supernumerary [[major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] in the British Army in July 1893<ref>''London Gazette'', 30 June 1893</ref> and a ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' in the German Army on 18 April 1895.<ref name=dew/>

Because Francis had no inheritance, the couple lived on Mary Adelaide's Parliamentary allowance of £5,000 per annum (equivalent to ca. £525,000 in 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/resources/inflationtools/calculator/flash/default.aspx|title = Bank of England Inflation Calculator|date = |accessdate = 2014-11-27|website = Bank of England|publisher = Bank of England|last = |first = }}</ref>), supplemented by income from her mother, [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|the Duchess of Cambridge]]. Mary Adelaide's requests to her cousin, [[Queen Victoria]], for more funds were met with refusal; however, they were granted a [[grace-and-favour]] apartment in [[Kensington Palace]], [[London]] and a country house, [[White Lodge]], the former Royal deer-hunting lodge in [[Richmond Park]], Southwest London.

The Duke and Duchess lived beyond their means, leading to the build-up of large debts. In 1883, the Tecks fled the UK to continental Europe, where they stayed with relatives in [[Florence]] and [[Germany]]. They eventually returned to the UK in 1885.

==Later life==
With an [[Order in Council]] on 1 July 1887, Queen Victoria granted Francis the style of ''[[Highness]]'', as a gift to celebrate her [[Golden Jubilee]].<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#1887 Royal Styles and Titles – 1887 Order-in-Council]</ref> Despite this, the Tecks were still seen as minor relatives, with little status or wealth. Their fortunes improved when their only daughter, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (known as ''May'' to her family) became engaged to the second-in-line to the British throne, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale]]. There was initial opposition to the match from the Duke of Clarence's parents, the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]]: [[Arthur Balfour]] wrote to [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] in 1890 that "(t)he Teck girl they won't have because they hate Teck and because the vision of Princess Mary haunting [[Marlborough House]] makes the Prince of Wales ill."<ref>Balfour to Salisbury, 30 August 1890, quoted in [[Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont|Max Egremont]], ''Balfour: A Life of Arthur James Balfour'' (Collins, 1980) page 103</ref> Nevertheless, the Queen gave her official consent to the engagement on 12 December 1891.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=26233|page=6911|date=15 December 1891}}</ref> The death of the Duke of Clarence only six weeks later was a cruel blow. However, Princess May consented when the Duke of Clarence's brother (and next in the line of succession), [[George V of the United Kingdom|Prince George, Duke of York]], proposed to her instead. 

In 1897, the Duchess of Teck died, leaving Francis a widower. He continued to live at White Lodge, Richmond, but did not carry out any royal duties.

In ''[[Who's Who]]'', the Duke of Teck listed his recreations as "a little of all". He was President of the [[Royal Botanic Society]] and a member of numerous clubs, including [[White's]], the [[Marlborough Club]], the [[Bachelors' Club]], the [[Army and Navy Club]], the [[United Service Club]], the [[Cavalry Club]], the [[Naval and Military Club]], the [[Travellers' Club]], the [[St George's Club]], the [[Hurlingham Club]], the [[Ranelagh Club]] and the [[Jockey Club]], as well as the Adels-Casino at Vienna and the Herren-Casino at [[Stuttgart]].<ref name=whowaswho/>

The Duke of Teck died on 21 January 1900 at White Lodge.<ref>''[[The Times]]'' Tuesday, 23 Jan 1900; pg. 7; Issue 36046; col D</ref> He was buried next to his wife in the Royal Vault at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor]].

There is a pub in [[Earls Court]], London, called the [[Prince of Teck (Earls Court)|Prince of Teck]].
