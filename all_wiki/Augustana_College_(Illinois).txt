'''Augustana College''' is a private [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Lutheran]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Rock Island, Illinois]]. The college enrolls approximately 2,500 students.  Covering {{Convert|115|acre|ha|1}} of hilly, wooded land, Augustana is adjacent to the [[Mississippi River]].

==History==
Augustana College was founded as Augustana College and Theological Seminary in 1860 by the [[Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod]]. Located first in Chicago, it moved to [[Paxton, Illinois]], in 1863 and to Rock Island, Illinois, its current home, in 1875.<ref>Conrad Bergendoff, "Augustana...A Profession of Faith, A History of Augustana College, 1860–1935" (1969)</ref>

After 1890, an increasingly large [[Swedish American]] community in America promoted a new institutional structure, including a lively Swedish-language press, many new churches, several colleges, and a network of  ethnic organizations. The result was to foster a sense of Swedishness with pride in the United States. Thus, there emerged a self-confident Americanized generation. Augustana College put itself in the lead of the movement to affirm Swedish American identity. Early on all the students had been born in Sweden but by 1890 the second generation of American-born students predominated. They typically had white-collar or professional backgrounds; few were the sons and daughters of farmers and laborers. These middle class youth  developed an idealized view of Sweden, characterized by romanticism, patriotism, and idealism, just like their counterparts across the Atlantic. The new generation was especially proud of the Swedish contributions to American democracy and of the creation of a republic that promised liberty and destroyed the menace of slavery.<ref>Dag Blanck, ''The Creation of an Ethnic Identity: Being Swedish American in the Augustana Synod, 1860–1917'' (2006)</ref>

The college grew by donation of {{convert|5|acre|ha}} on the south in 1886 and purchase, enabled by donation of [[C.J.A. Ericson]], of 10–12 acres to the north in 1899.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Augustana Campus History: 1900–1929 |url=http://www.augustana.edu/SpecialCollections/CampusHistory/section2.html |publisher=Augustana College |accessdate=27 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906135148/http://www.augustana.edu/SpecialCollections/CampusHistory/section2.html |archivedate=6 September 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ato0AAAAIAAJ |title=The Swedish Element in Illinois, Survey of the Last Seven Decades, With Life Sketches of Men of Todayr |publisher=Swedish American Biographical Association |date=1917 |author=Ernst W. Olsen |page=125}} (from sub-chapter section on "Augustana College and Theological Seminary")</ref>

In 1947, when [[Conrad Bergendoff]] was college president, the Augustana Seminary formally separated from Augustana College and became an independent body.  It remained on the Rock Island campus until the 1960s, when the Seminary moved to Chicago.<ref>Thomas Tredway, "Coming of Age: A History of Augustana College, 1935–1937" (2010)</ref> It merged with other [[Lutheran]] seminaries to form the [[Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago]].

==Academics==
Augustana ranks among the top 40 U.S. liberal arts colleges in the sciences, based on the number of graduates earning Ph.D.s. Students accepted to Augustana typically rank in the top 20% of their high school classes. The middle 50 percent of enrolled students for the class of 2012 scored 26–30 on the ACT, well above the national averages. Augustana College is considered highly selective.<ref name=Princeton_Review>{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/schools/college/CollegeAdmissions.aspx?iid=1022999|title=College Advice|work=princetonreview.com|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref> 73% of Augustana students graduate in four years and 78% graduate in six years.

The services offered through CORE (Careers, Opportunities, Research and Exploration) afford students an advantage in graduate school placement and the job market. Three distinguishing opportunities are:
Augie Choice: $2000 offered to every student to support hands-on learning through research, an internship or international study;
The Viking Scorecard: a career and graduate school preparation guide;
A wide variety of faculty-led international programs ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months and covering all 7 continents.
;Academic programs
Augustana currently has nearly 90 academic programs and fields of study including nine pre-professional and eight interdisciplinary programs: ranging from Accounting to World Literature.
