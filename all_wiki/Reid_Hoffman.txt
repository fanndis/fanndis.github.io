==Career==

===Early years===
While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale.<ref name="Crown Business" /> He saw academia as an opportunity to make an "impact," but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. "When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cree |first=Richard |title=Well connected |journal=Director Magazine |date=July 2009}}</ref>

With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship. His first job was an internship at [[Inglenook (winery)|Inglenook]], a winery in Napa Valley.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.kornferry.com/institute/60-the-brain-behind-linkedin |title=The Brain Behind LinkedIn |work=Korn Ferry |access-date=March 13, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> He later joined Apple Computer in 1994, where he worked on [[eWorld]], an early attempt at creating a social network. eWorld was acquired by AOL in 1996.<ref name="Bloomberg Television">{{cite news |title=Reid Hoffman Revealed: Bloomberg Gamechangers |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/92790093-reid-hoffman-revealed-bloomberg-game-changers.html |publisher=Bloomberg Television |access-date=December 15, 2012}}</ref> He later worked at Fujitsu before co-founding his first company – SocialNet.com in 1997. It focused "on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood."<ref name="Rusli">{{cite news |last=Rusli |first=Evelyn |title=A King of Connections Is Tech's Go–To Guy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/business/reid-hoffman-of-linkedin-has-become-the-go-to-guy-of-tech.html?pagewanted=all |access-date=December 15, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 5, 2011 |ref=New York Times}}</ref> [[Peter Thiel]] has said SocialNet.com was "literally an idea before its time. It was a social network 7 or 8 years before that became a trend."<ref name="Bloomberg Television" />

===PayPal===
While at SocialNet, Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of [[PayPal]], an electronic money transmission service. In January 2000, he left SocialNet and joined PayPal full-time as the company's COO.<ref name="Rusli" /> Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that "PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment."<ref name="Bloomberg Television" /> Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure ([[VISA]], [[MasterCard]], [[ACH Network|ACH]], [[WellsFargo]]), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman "was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires."<ref name="Rusli" /><ref>{{cite web|title= Reid Hoffman Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=   https://www.achievement.org/achiever/reid-hoffman/#interview}}</ref> At the time of PayPal's acquisition by [[eBay]] for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.

===LinkedIn===

Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue), a former college classmate and a former colleague from his time at Fujitsu.<ref name="Crown Business" /> It launched on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.<ref name="LinkedIn: About">{{cite web |title=LinkedIn: About |url=http://press.linkedin.com/about |publisher=LinkedIn |access-date=November 20, 2014 |ref=LinkedIn}}</ref> Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, colleagues of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn.<ref name="Crown Business" /> By November 2014, LinkedIn had over 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.<ref name="LinkedIn: About" /> The site allows registered users to create professional profiles and connect with each other. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. According to Forbes, "LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Your LinkedIn Intervention: 5 Changes You Must Make |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/07/06/your-linkedin-intervention-5-changes-you-must-make/ |magazine=Forbes |access-date=December 15, 2012 |date=July 6, 2012}}</ref>

In an interview, Hoffman said that "you have to think proactively about how to use a tool that enables your ability to move in ways that you weren't able to move before, and most of people are not very good at that".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKDcbFGct8A |title=Fireside Chat With Reid Hoffman |website=Youtube.com |date=August 2012}}</ref>

===''The Start-Up of You''===
Hoffman is co-author, with [[Ben Casnocha]], of the career book ''The Start-Up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform your Career''.<ref name="Crown Business" />

The book was released in the United States on February 14, 2012. It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one – the "CEO of their own career" – and draws many parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual's career.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7398910n |work=CBS News |title=LinkedIn co-founder on "The Start-Up of You"}}</ref>

The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as "allies" and move from a transactional approach to employment to a "relational" one. It proposes a new framework for managers and employers to organize their work, described as "tours of duty." Further, it argues why managers should encourage their employees to gather "network intelligence" and why companies and managers should maintain a lifelong relationship with former employees via a corporate alumni network.<ref name=TheAllianceFramework.com>{{cite web |title=The Alliance |url=http://www.theallianceframework.com/ |website=The Alliance |access-date=November 20, 2014}}</ref>
