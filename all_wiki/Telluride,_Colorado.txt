'''Telluride''' is the [[county seat]] and most populous town of [[San Miguel County, Colorado|San Miguel County]] in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of [[Colorado]].<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|access-date=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref>  The town is a former [[silver]] [[mining]] camp on the [[San Miguel River (Colorado)|San Miguel River]] in the western [[San Juan Mountains]]. The first gold mining claim was made in the mountains above Telluride in 1875, and early settlement of what is now Telluride followed. The town itself was founded in 1878 as "Columbia", but due to confusion with a California town of the same name, was renamed Telluride in 1887 for the [[gold telluride]] minerals found in other parts of Colorado. These telluride minerals were never found near Telluride, but the area's mines for some years provided zinc, lead, copper, silver, and other gold ores.

Telluride sits in a [[Canyon|box canyon]]. Steep forested mountains and cliffs surround it, with [[Bridal Veil Falls (Telluride)|Bridal Veil Falls]] situated at the canyon's head. Numerous weathered ruins of old mining operations dot the hillsides. A free [[Gondola lift|gondola]] connects the town with its companion town, [[Mountain Village, Colorado]], at the base of the ski area. Telluride and the surrounding area have featured prominently in popular culture, and it is the subject of several popular songs. It is especially known for its [[ski resort]] and slopes during the winter, as well as an extensive festival schedule during the summer.

The [[Telluride Historic District]], which includes a significant portion of the town, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is also one of [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Colorado|Colorado's 20 National Historic Landmarks]]. The town population was 2,325 in the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name="United States Census 2010">{{cite web | url = https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php | title = 2010 Census Interactive Population Search | publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division | access-date = January 4, 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Gold-245690.jpg|thumb|Historic gold specimen from Telluride]]

===Mining days===
Gold was first discovered in Colorado near present-day Denver, setting off the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush|Pike's Peak gold rush of 1858]]. The Smuggler gold vein above Telluride, and placer gold in the [[San Miguel River (Colorado)|San Miguel River]], were discovered in 1875.<ref name=Voynick>Voynick, S.M., 1992, Colorado Gold, Missoula: Mountain Press Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0878424555}}</ref>{{rp|51,54}}  John Fallon made the first claim in Marshal Basin above Telluride in 1875 and early settlement of Telluride followed. The town itself was founded in 1878. Telluride was originally named "Columbia", but due to confusion with [[Columbia, California|Columbia]], [[California]], the name was changed by the [[post office]] in 1887. The town was named after valuable ore compounds of the [[chemical element]] [[tellurium]], a [[metalloid]] element which forms natural [[telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]], the most notable of which are telluride ores of gold and silver. Although [[gold telluride]] minerals were never actually found in the mountains near Telluride, the area's [[Mining|mines]] were rich in [[zinc]], [[lead]], [[copper]], silver, and ores which contained gold in other forms.

Telluride began slowly because of its isolated location. In 1881, a [[toll road]] was opened by [[Otto Mears]] which allowed wagons to go where only pack [[mule]]s could go before. This increased the number of people in Telluride, but it was still expensive to get gold-rich [[ore]] out of the valley.

In June 1889, [[Butch Cassidy]], before becoming associated with his gang, "the wild bunch", robbed the San Miguel Valley Bank in Telluride. This was his first major recorded crime. He exited the bank with [[US$|$]]24,580, and later became famous as a bank robber.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/old-text-wrinkles-did-butch-cassidy-survive-083206159.html|access-date=August 15, 2011|title=Old text, new wrinkles: Did Butch Cassidy survive?|agency=Associated Press|first=Mead|last=Gruver|date=August 15, 2011}}</ref>

In 1891, the [[Rio Grande Southern]] [[railroad]], also begun by Mears, arrived in Telluride, eventually building a two stall engine house, water facilities, a section house and a bunkhouse, sidings and a depot. It continued further up the valley to end its Telluride branch at Pandora, serving the mines and the town until 1952. The cheaper and consistent transportation for passengers and freight allowed miners and goods to flow into the San Miguel town and ore to flow out to the mills and foundries elsewhere. This brought a brief but unprecedented boom to Telluride before the [[Panic of 1893]].<ref name=NGC_Telluride>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Jerry|title=Telluride, Colorado – Mile Post 45.1 – Elev. 8,756ft|url=http://www.narrowgauge.org/ngc/html/excursion1/excursion1-telluride.html|work=The Narrow Gauge Circle|publisher=Mark L. Evans|access-date=19 May 2013}}</ref>

Around the turn of the 20th century, there were serious [[trade union|labor disputes]] in the mines near Telluride. The [[Colorado National Guard]] was called out and there were deaths on both sides. [[trade union|Unions]] were formed as miners joined the [[Western Federation of Miners]] in 1896. 1899 brought big changes as union [[strike action]] led most mines to grant miners $3 a day for an 8-hour day’s work plus a boarding pay of $1 a day. At this time, workers were putting in 10- to 12-hour days and the mines ran 24 hours a day. [[Occupational safety and health|Work conditions]] were treacherous, with mines above 12,000&nbsp;ft, a lack of safety measures, and bitter weather in winter months. Even the [[boarding houses]] were precariously placed on the mountainsides.

[[File:Bridal Veil Falls Telluride CO.jpg|thumb|left|Bridal Veil Falls in Telluride]]
Telluride's labor unrest occurred against the backdrop of a statewide struggle between miners and mine owners. [[Bulkeley Wells]] was one mine operator considerably hostile to the union. The Telluride Miners' Union was led by [[Vincent Saint John|Vincent St. John]]. The disappearance of mine guard [[William J. Barney]], which Wells declared a "murder", created much intrigue and national interest. The accusations, animosity, [[gun]]play, and expulsions which followed were part of an ongoing struggle throughout Colorado's mining communities which came to be called the [[Colorado Labor Wars]].

In 1891, Telluride's [[L.L. Nunn]] joined forces with [[George Westinghouse]] to build the [[Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant]], an [[alternating current]] [[power plant]], near Telluride. (Nunn's home can be found at the corner of Aspen and Columbia Streets; next door is the home he purchased for the "pinheads"{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} to study hydro-electric engineering.) The plant supplied power to the [[2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill|Gold King Mine]] 3.5 miles away. This was the first successful demonstration of long-distance transmission of industrial-grade alternating current power and used two 100-hp Westinghouse alternators, one working as a generator producing 3,000 volt, 133 Hertz, single-phase AC, and the other used as an AC motor.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=31O4upzTHQwC&q=In+1891+Telluride+westinghouse+induction+motor&pg=PA39|title=The Foundations of Vacuum Coating Technology|first=D. M.|last=Mattox|date=15 January 2013|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780080947051|access-date=26 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> This hydroelectric AC power plant predated the Westinghouse plant at [[Niagara Falls]] by 4 years.<ref name="books.google.com"/> Nunn and his brother Paul built power plants in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Mexico, and the Ontario Power plant at Niagara Falls on the Canadian side. Nunn developed a keen interest in education as part of his electrical power companies, and in conjunction with Cornell University built the [[Telluride House]] at Cornell in 1909 to educate promising students in [[electrical engineering]]. Later, Nunn along with [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]], started the non-profit [[Telluride Association]]. Nunn founded [[Deep Springs College]] in 1917. All of Nunn's educational endeavors are going strong today. Each year, the Telluride Tech Festival honors Nunn, inventor [[Nikola Tesla]], and Westinghouse, along with current day technology and science leaders.

Telluride's most famous historic mines are the Tomboy, Pandora, Smuggler-Union, Nellie, and Sheridan mines. Beginning in 1939, the hard-rock mining operations in the Red Mountain and Telluride mining districts began a lengthy [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] under the [[Idarado Mine|Idarado Mining Company]] (Idarado), now a division of [[Newmont Mining]]. The consolidation ended in 1953 with Idarado’s acquisition of the Telluride Mines. Idarado kept the underground workings and mill operations open at Telluride’s Pandora hard-rock mine until 1978. When the mine officially closed, the [[snow]] which tormented Telluride's miners became the town's new source of income, in the form of [[skiing]] and tourism. The documentary video "the YX factor" chronicles the transition from mining to skiing and the influx of "[[hippies]]" in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the words of local residents and commentators such as [[Peter Yarrow]] and [[Tom Hayden]].

[[File:AERIAL VIEW OF TELLURIDE SHOWING NEWLY-CUT SKI TRAILS (IN RIGHT FOREGROUND - NARA - 543746.jpg|thumb|upright|Aerial view of newly cut Boomerang Road (May 1972).]]

===Skiing era===
Mining was Telluride’s only industry until 1972, when the first [[Chairlift|ski lift]] was installed by [[Telluride Ski Resort]] founder [[Joseph T. Zoline]] and his Telluride Ski Corporation (Telco). Zoline bought the land for the future resort in 1969 and began to craft the slopes. Along with his mountain manager, Telluride native Bill "Sr." Mahoney, they slowly and thoughtfully put together a plan for sustained development of Telluride and the region. As mining phased out and a new service industry phased in, the local population changed sharply. Mining families fled Telluride to settle in places like [[Moab, Utah]], where uranium mining offered hope of continued employment. Mining families were replaced by what locals referred to as "[[hippie]]s", young people with a 1960s worldview that often clashed with the values of Telluride's old-timers. These newcomers were characterized as idle "trustfunders" drawn to the town for a casual lifestyle and outdoor excitements such as [[hang gliding]], [[Mountaineering|mountain climbing]], and [[kayaking]].
[[File:Tel2wall.jpg|thumb|A view in Telluride from the ski slopes by Mountain Village.]]
The new population opposed town growth and economic expansion, including growth due to tourism and skiing. At one point, a serious effort was made to ban cars from the city limits and force visitors to use horse-drawn carts. The 1970s had fluctuating snowfalls and economic recession, but the town's music and film festivals flourished. They exposed hundreds of thousands to the grandeur of the valley for the first time and created iconic associations with elite entertainers. Meanwhile, ski area founder Joe Zoline worked to develop one of the best mountains in North America for expert skiers,{{fact|date=July 2020}} and created infrastructure for tourism that respected Telluride's need to stay small.{{fact|date=July 2020}}

As the final ore carts were rolling out of the Pandora mine, tourists began to discover Telluride's views, skiing, and autumn color changes. After the brutal snow drought of 1976 nearly wiped out the embryonic ski and lodging industry, the town started to rebound economically. In 1978, Ron Allred and his partner Jim Wells bought a stake of the ski area to form the Telluride Company. They expanded the infrastructure by adding a gondola connecting Telluride with the Mountain Village.

The [[Grateful Dead]] played Telluride on 8/16/87 and 8/17/87 riding the recent success of [[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)]].

During the 1980s, Telluride developed a reputation as "Colorado's best-kept secret", which paradoxically made it one of the better-known resort communities. Wealthy skiers flocked to the mountain all winter, and sightseers kept hotel rooms full all summer. Telluride also became notorious in the drug counterculture as a drop point for Mexican smugglers and a favorite place for wealthy importers to enjoy downtime. The town was even featured in the hit song by [[Glenn Frey]] from ''[[Miami Vice]]'', "Smugglers Blues".  Telluride was living up to its Wild West history. This type of attention helped differentiate it from [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]]. The festivals and Telluride's bad-boy image attracted celebrities like [[Tom Cruise]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], and [[Oliver Stone]]. By the mid-1990s, Telluride had shed both its mining personality and drug image to establish itself as a premier resort town balancing modern culture with fascinating western history. In 2003, Prospect Bowl, an extension to the ski area opened, providing the resort with many new trails and runs. In 2007–08, the ski area opened some of the most extreme, in-bound, hike-to terrain in the country. Most lifts in the area are high-speed quad chairs capable of holding four passengers. The highest lift on the mountain reaches 12,570 feet.

Telluride has a [[free box]] that is well supported by the community.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lise |last=Waring |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |title=The Free Box Provides |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lise-waring/the-free-box-provides_b_603900.html |date=June 9, 2010}}</ref>

==Geography==
Telluride has an elevation of {{convert|8750|ft}} in an isolated spot in Southwest Colorado. From the west, Colorado Route 145 is the most common way into Telluride; two other passes enter the town, [[Imogene Pass]] and [[Black Bear Road|Black Bear Pass]].

On the eastern side of town, there are two waterfalls: Ingram Falls, which is visible from town, and [[Bridal Veil Falls (Telluride)|Bridal Veil Falls]] and the Bridal Veil Hydroelectric plant, which are just out of sight from town to the right of Ingram. The power plant house was leased for a period of time by Eric Jacobson, who restored the house and the generator inside. The hydroelectric plant was built in 1895 to power the Smuggler-Union Mine.

The town is served by air transportation via [[Telluride Regional Airport]] (TEX), once the highest elevation commercial airport in the United States at 9,070 feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/20/aspen-telluride-airport-landings/|title=Aspen, Telluride make list of America's most white-knuckle airport landings|date=20 March 2017|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> The airport is considered challenging by pilots because of frequent adverse weather conditions, high elevation, and the extremely rugged mountain terrain surrounding the airport on nearly all sides. Major airline service is provided seasonally into Montrose (MTJ), approximately {{convert|70|mi}} north by road.

===Climate===
Telluride has a [[humid continental climate]] (Dfb). The coldest month is January, averaging {{convert|21|F|C}}, and the hottest July, which averages {{convert|59.9|F|C}}. Precipitation peaks as snow in winter and as thunderstorms in summer with a dry period in late spring. Telluride gets decent precipitation all year due to its altitude, averaging {{convert|23|in|cm|abbr=}} of rain and {{convert|177|in|cm|abbr=}} inches of snow per year.

==Tourism==

Beyond the ski lifts, Telluride is now widely recognized as an all-season resort. Telluride Ski Resort is the main attraction in the winter. But when summer comes around, Telluride transforms into an outdoor recreation hot spot, with tourists visiting to enjoy [[mountain biking]], [[hiking]], river rafting, [[sightseeing]] and more. The Telluride Tourism Board promotes tourism in the region.

Telluride features over 30 hiking trails ranging in difficulty level. Some of the hiking routes include Ajax Peak, Bear Creek Falls, Hope Lake, and Bridal Veil Falls. Hiking season begins in May and lasts until early October, with waterfalls gushing in June and wildflowers at their peak in early July. The trails range from quick and easy runs to multi-day hiking trips that reach an elevation of 14,000 feet. Nearly all the trails feature waterfalls, wildflowers, and high alpine lakes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telluride.com/activities/hikingrunning|title=Hiking and Running|last=Telluride.com|website=www.telluride.com}}</ref>

Telluride is also home to many endurance events. The [[Hardrock 100]], held in July, has a major aid station in the town park. The Fall Tilt, a 12-hour downhill mountain biking event, is held in Mountain Village each September. And the 40-mile Telluride Mountain Run loops the town in a wide swath that includes some of the most difficult and scenic trails in the area.

==Transportation==
Telluride is served by [[Telluride Regional Airport]]. Scheduled flight options are limited, due to the airport's somewhat short runway and frequent closures under bad weather, so most passengers going to Telluride use [[Montrose Regional Airport]], 67 miles to the north.

Free public transportation is provided in Telluride. The bus system, called ''Galloping Goose'', makes a complete loop around the town and the ''Gondola'' links Telluride with [[Mountain Village, Colorado|Mountain Village]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telluride.com/gondola |title=Gondola |website=Telluride.com |access-date=2016-01-02}}</ref> The Galloping Goose loops around every 20 minutes from 7 am to 9 pm. It stops at major locations such as the Gondola, the Post Office, and the Courthouse.

Telluride's free Gondola is the only one of its kind in North America. It stops at three stations: Telluride, San Sophia, and Mountain Village. It is a 13-minute ride and reaches an elevation of 10,540 feet at the San Sophia station.[16] The gondola cabins feature bike and ski racks for recreational use. There are also pet-friendly and handicap accessible cabins available. The Gondola is open from 6:30 am to midnight during summer and winter season. It closes for six weeks during the off-season. 

Regional bus service is provided by the San Miguel Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART).

Telluride is part of Colorado's [[Bustang]] network. It is on the Durango-Grand Junction Outrider line.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bustang Schedule |url=https://ridebustang.com/schedules/ |website=RideBustang |publisher=CDOT}}</ref>
;Major highways
*[[File:Colorado 145.svg|25px]] '''[[Colorado State Highway 145|State Highway 145]]''' is part of the [[San Juan Skyway]]. It connects Telluride to [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]] and [[Naturita, Colorado|Naturita]]. This road also gives access to [[Colorado State Highway 62|State Highway 62]], the main route to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]] and other important places in [[Colorado]].

;Mountain passes
There are two alternate passes to enter the town: [[Imogene Pass]] and [[Black Bear Road|Black Bear Pass]] (both require high clearance or four-wheel-drive vehicles).

==In popular culture==

The movie ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' by [[Quentin Tarantino]] conducted its [[principal photography]] on December 8, 2014, in Colorado on the Schmid Ranch near Telluride.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quentin Tarantino Starts Shooting 'Hateful Eight'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/quentin-tarantino-starts-shooting-hateful-eight-1201413017/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=5 January 2016}}</ref>
