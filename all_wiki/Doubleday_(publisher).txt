'''Doubleday''' is an American publishing company. It was founded as the '''Doubleday & McClure Company''' in 1897 and was the largest in the United States by 1947. It published the work of mostly U.S. authors under a number of imprints and distributed them through its own stores. In 2009 Doubleday merged with Knopf Publishing Group to form the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, which is now part of [[Penguin Random House]]. In 2019, the official website presents Doubleday as an [[Imprint (trade name) |imprint]], not a publisher.

==History==
The firm was founded as Doubleday & McClure Company in 1897 by [[Frank Nelson Doubleday]] in partnership with [[Samuel Sidney McClure]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|work=randomhouse.com|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/history/}}</ref> McClure had founded the first U.S. newspaper syndicate in 1884 ([[McClure Syndicate]]) and the monthly ''[[McClure's Magazine]]'' in 1893.<!-- from our linked articles --> One of their first [[bestseller]]s was ''[[The Day's Work]]'' by [[Rudyard Kipling]], a short story collection that Macmillan published in Britain late in 1898. <!-- all out of sequence? -->Other authors published by the company in its early years include [[W. Somerset Maugham]] and [[Joseph Conrad]].{{when?|date=April 2019}} [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]] later served as a vice-president of the company.{{when?|date=April 2019}}

The partnership ended in 1900. McClure and [[John Sanborn Phillips]], the co-founder of his magazine, formed McClure, Phillips and Company. Doubleday and [[Walter Hines Page]] formed '''Doubleday, Page & Company'''.

The racist but best-selling novels of [[Thomas Dixon Jr.]] (''[[The Leopard's Spots]]'', 1902; ''[[The Clansman]]'', 1905) "changed a struggling publishing venture into the empire that Doubleday was to become". At the same time, Doubleday helped Dixon launch his writing career. Page and Dixon were both from North Carolina and had known each other in Raleigh.<ref>{{cite book

Co-founder and Garden City resident Walter Hines Page was named [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to Great Britain]] in 1916. In 1922 the company founded its juvenile department, the second in the nation, with [[May Massee]] as head.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.emporia.edu/dotAsset/ca646db2-5b18-40e9-a17b-9a4de3a1a54b.pdf|title=THE MAY MASSEE COLLECTION|date=1979|editor-last=Hodowanec|editor-first=George V.|publisher=Emporia State University|access-date=October 30, 2018}}</ref> The founder's son [[Nelson Doubleday]] joined the firm in the same year.

In 1927, Doubleday, Page merged with the [[George H. Doran Company]], creating '''Doubleday, Doran''', then the largest publishing business in the English-speaking world.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 1944, Doubleday, Doran acquired the Philadelphia medical publisher Blakiston.<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| title = Books -- Authors| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2019-11-10| date = 1944-06-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1944/06/02/archives/books-authors.html}}</ref> In 1946, the company became '''Doubleday and Company'''. [[Nelson Doubleday]] resigned as president, but continued as chairman of the board until his death on January 11, 1949. [[Douglas Black (publisher)|Douglas Black]] took over as president from 1946 to 1963. His tenure attracted numerous public figures to the publishing company, including [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Robert Taft Jr.|Robert Taft]], and [[André Malraux]]. He was a strong opponent of censorship and felt that it was his responsibility to the American public to publish controversial titles. Black also expanded Doubleday's publishing program by opening two new printing plants; creating a new line of quality paperbacks, under the imprint Anchor Books; attracting new book clubs to its book club division; opening 30 new retail stores in 25 cities; and opening new editorial offices in San Francisco, London, and Paris.<ref name="princeton">{{cite web|url=http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=C0858&kw=|publisher=diglib.princeton.edu|title=Daphne Du Maurier Letters to Douglas Black (C0858) -- Daphne Du Maurier Letters to Douglas Black|accessdate=2016-12-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054432/http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=C0858&kw=|archivedate=2011-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/05/17/75285381.html?action=click&contentCollection=Archives&module=LedeAsset&region=ArchiveBody&pgtype=article&pageNumber=34|title=DOUGLAS M.
