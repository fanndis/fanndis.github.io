==History==
[[Penguin Books]] Ltd. (est. 1935) of the United Kingdom was bought over by [[Longman|Pearson Longman]] in 1970. In 1975, Penguin acquired the American hardcover firm [[Viking Press]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/11/archives/viking-press-is-sold-to-penguin-books.html|title=Viking Press Is Sold to Penguin Books|last=Whitman|first=Alden|date=1975-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 1986, Penguin acquired the [[New American Library]], a mass-market paperback publisher.<ref>{{Cite web| last = McDowell| first = Edwin| title = PENGUIN AGREES TO BUY NEW AMERICAN LIBRARY| accessdate = 2018-12-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/garden/penguin-agrees-to-buy-new-american-library.html}}</ref>

Penguin Group (USA) Inc. was formed in 1996 as a result of the merger between Penguin Books USA and the [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam Berkley Group]] after Penguin acquired Putnam Berkley from [[MCA Inc.|MCA]].<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Lyall| first = Sarah| title = Penguin Is Buying MCA's Putnam Berkley for $336 Million| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-12-02| date = 1996-11-27| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/penguin-is-buying-mca-s-putnam-berkley-for-336-million.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/5618/index1.html|title=Now for the Grann Finale|website=NYMag.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}</ref> The newly formed company was originally called Penguin Putnam Inc., but, in 2003, it changed its name to Penguin Group (USA) Inc. to reflect the parent Pearson PLC's grouping of all the Penguin companies worldwide under the supervisory umbrella of Pearson's own Penguin Group division.

The different Penguin companies use many [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s, many of which used to be independent publishers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/index.html|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us}}</ref> Penguin Group (USA) Inc. also operates its own speaker's bureau that books speaking engagements for many of the publisher's authors. In 2011, the online writing and publishing community [[Book Country]] was launched as a subsidiary of Penguin Group USA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcountry.com/AboutUs/Penguin.aspx |title=What's the Penguin About? |publisher=Bookcountry.com |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref>

In April 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] filed ''[[United States v. Apple Inc.]]'', naming [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], Penguin, and four other major publishers as defendants.  The suit alleged that they conspired to [[price-fixing|fix prices]] for [[e-books]] and weaken [[Amazon.com]]'s position in the market in violation of [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]].<ref name="washington post DOJ sues">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/justice-department-files-suit-against-apple-publishers-report-says/2012/04/11/gIQAzyXSAT_story.html |title=Justice Department sues Apple, publishers over e-book prices |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2014 |author=Mui, Ylan Q. and Hayley Tsukayama}}</ref> In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which Penguin and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing.<ref name="usatoday settlements rolling out">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/03/25/amazon-settlements-ebooks/6869033/ |title=E-book price fixing settlements rolling out |work=USA Today |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=1 June 2014 |author=Molina, Brett}}</ref>

In October 2012, Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate [[Bertelsmann]], over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and [[Random House]]. The houses were considered two of the 'Big Six' publishing companies prior to the merger,<ref>{{cite web |last=Edgecliffe |first=Andrew |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/eaf8eaaa-1eac-11e2-be82-00144feabdc0.html |title=Penguin and Random House in deal talks |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> which became the 'Big Five' upon its completion. The [[European Union]] approved the [[Penguin Random House]] merger on 5 April 2013.
