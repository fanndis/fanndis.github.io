The '''United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit''' (in [[case citation]]s, '''2d Cir.''') is one of the thirteen [[United States Courts of Appeals]]. Its territory comprises the states of [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Vermont]]. The court has [[appellate jurisdiction]] over the [[United States district court|district courts]] in the following [[United States federal judicial district|districts]]:

* [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut|District of Connecticut]]
* [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|Eastern District of New York]]
* [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York|Northern District of New York]]
* [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]]
* [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York|Western District of New York]]
* [[United States District Court for the District of Vermont|District of Vermont]]

The Second Circuit has its clerk's office and hears oral arguments at the [[Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse]] at 40 [[Foley Square]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. Due to renovations at that building, from 2006 until early 2013, the court temporarily relocated to the [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse]] across Pearl Street from Foley Square, and certain court offices temporarily relocated to the [[Woolworth Building]] at 233 Broadway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/facelift-scheduled-for-federal-courthouse/32316/|title=Facelift Scheduled for Federal Courthouse - The New York Sun|website=nysun.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref>

Because the Second Circuit includes [[New York City]], it has long been one of the largest and most influential American appellate courts, especially in matters of [[contract law]], [[securities law]], and [[antitrust law]]. Over the course of the twentieth century, it came to be considered one of the two most prestigious federal appellate courts, along with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|District of Columbia Circuit Court]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Solimine|first=Michael E.|date=Summer 2005|title=Judicial Stratification and the Reputations of the United States Courts of Appeals|url=https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1246&context=lr|journal=Florida State University Law Review|volume=32|issue=4|pages=1341–1342|access-date=July 22, 2020}}</ref> Several notable judges have served on the Second Circuit, including three later named [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]: [[John Marshall Harlan II]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], and [[Sonia Sotomayor]]. Judge [[Learned Hand]] served on the court from 1924 to 1961, as did his cousin, [[Augustus Noble Hand]], from 1927 until 1953. Judge [[Henry Friendly]] served from 1959 to 1986.
