In November 2007 he told the [[BBC Radio 4]] ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme that he was not "totally convinced" of the need for 42-day detention (without trial) of terrorist suspects. But less than two hours later, following a meeting with the [[Prime Minister]], he said he was "convinced" of the need for the new legislation. The incident was an embarrassment for the government, particularly as West was the [[minister (government)|minister]] charged with navigating the controversial [[Counter-Terrorism Act 2008]] through the House of Lords.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7097907.stm |title=Pienaar's view: Terror issue not plain sailing |publisher=BBC|date=16 November 2007|accessdate=21 June 2014}}</ref> During his time with the Home Office, he produced the United Kingdom's first ever National Security Strategy (as trailed in his Seaford House paper of 1992) and Cyber Security strategy as well as formulating a series of other new strategies: the counter-terrorist policy, cyber security, chemical, biological radiological and nuclear security, science and technology for countering international [[terrorism]] and guidance for local government in enhancing the security of crowded places.<ref name=solent/> In May 2010, Lord West departed the [[Home Office]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-west-of-spithead/3834|title=UK Parliament - Biography|accessdate=11 August 2016}}</ref>

In the wake of the June 2015 [[Sousse attack]], he said Britain must step up the "propaganda war" against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL). "They are running rings around us in terms of the social media they are putting out." He also suggested the West should consider working with Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]], whom he qualified as a "loathsome man", while he called for Britain to consider joining the US in conducting air strikes against ISIL targets in Syria.<ref name="Sabur Malkin 2015">{{cite web | last=Sabur | first=Rozina | last2=Malkin | first2=Bonnie | title=Tunisia attack: 1000 armed police to protect British tourists as it happened on June 29 | website=The Daily Telegraph| date=2015-06-30 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/tunisia/11707371/Tunisia-attack-shooting-gunman-tourists-victims-live.html | access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name="Forces Network 2015">{{cite web | title="UK Should Work With Assad And Putin To Fight IS" | website=Forces Network | date=2015-06-29 | url=https://www.forces.net/news/tri-service/uk-should-work-assad-and-putin-fight | access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>
