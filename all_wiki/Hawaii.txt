It is the only U.S. state outside [[North America]], the only island state, and the only state in the [[tropics]]. 

The state encompasses nearly the entire [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian archipelago]], which consists of 137 [[High island|volcanic islands]] spanning {{convert|1500|mi}}, which are [[physiography|physiographically]] and [[Ethnography|ethnologically]] part of the [[Polynesia]]n subregion of [[Oceania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/is-hawaii-a-part-of-oceania-or-north-america.html|title=Is Hawaii a Part of Oceania or North America?|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=June 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711143815/https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/is-hawaii-a-part-of-oceania-or-north-america.html|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The state's ocean coastline is consequently the [[list of U.S. states and territories by coastline|fourth longest in the U.S]], at about {{convert|750|mi|km}}.{{efn|After Alaska, Florida, and California.}} The eight main islands, from northwest to southeast, are [[Niihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]], [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]], [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]], [[Lanai|Lāna{{okina}}i]], [[Kahoolawe|Kaho{{okina}}olawe]], [[Maui]], and [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]], after which the state is named; it is often called the "Big Island" or "Hawaii Island" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago.

It has more than 1.4{{nbs}}million residents, and is among the most diverse states in the country, with the nation's only [[Asian American]] demographic majority. The state capital and largest city is [[Honolulu]] on the island of O{{okina}}ahu. Settled by Polynesians some time between 124 and 1120 AD, Hawaii was an independent nation until 1898, when it was annexed by the United States. It became the most recent state to join the union, on August 21, 1959.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title48-chapter3-front&num=0&edition=prelim|title=[USC02] 48 USC Ch. 3: Front Matter|website=uscode.house.gov|access-date=October 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029034308/http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title48-chapter3-front&num=0&edition=prelim|archive-date=October 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> 

Hawaii's diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, active volcanoes, and clear skies on the Big Island make it a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, volcanologists, and astronomers. Due to its central location in the Pacific and successive waves of labor migration, Hawaii is a unique [[melting pot]] of [[Southeast Asian]], [[East Asian]] and [[North America]]n cultures, in addition to its [[Native Hawaiians|indigenous Hawaiian]] culture.

==Etymology==

The state of Hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island, {{lang|haw|[[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]]|italic=no}}. A common Hawaiian explanation of the name of {{lang|haw|Hawai{{okina}}i|italic=no}} is that it was named for {{lang|haw|[[Hawaiiloa|Hawai{{okina}}iloa]]|italic=no}}, a legendary figure from Hawaiian myth. He is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ethnomath.org/resources/cartwright1929.pdf |title=The Legend of Hawaii-loa |author=Bruce Cartwright |journal=Journal of the Polynesian Society |year=1929 |volume=38 |pages=105–121 |via=Ethnomathematics Digital Library (EDL) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713091306/http://www.ethnomath.org/resources/cartwright1929.pdf |archive-date=July 13, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiischoolreports.com/symbols/origins.htm |title=Origins of Hawaii's Names |access-date=February 24, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230195509/http://www.hawaiischoolreports.com/symbols/origins.htm |archive-date=December 30, 2006 }}</ref>

==Geography and environment==

{{Main Hawaiian Islands}}
{{Seealso|List of islands of Hawaii}}

There are eight main Hawaiian islands, seven of which are permanently inhabited. The island of Ni{{okina}}ihau is privately managed by brothers Bruce and [[Keith Robinson (environmentalist)|Keith Robinson]]; access is restricted to those who have permission from the island's owners. Access to uninhabited [[Kahoʻolawe]] island is also restricted.

Hawaii, like Alaska, does not border any other U.S. state. It is the only U.S. state that is not geographically located in North America, the only state completely surrounded by water and that is entirely an archipelago, and the only state in which coffee is commercially cultivable.

In addition to the eight main islands, the state has many smaller islands and islets. [[Kaʻula|Ka{{okina}}ula]] is a small island near Ni{{okina}}ihau. The [[Northwest Hawaiian Islands]] is a group of nine small, older islands to the northwest of Kaua{{okina}}i that extend from [[Nihoa]] to [[Kure Atoll]]; these are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains. Across the archipelago are around 130 small rocks and islets, such as [[Molokini]], which are either volcanic, marine sedimentary or erosional in origin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/haw_volc.html | title=General Information about Hawaiian Shield Volcanoes | last=Rubin | first=Ken | access-date=December 1, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229054039/http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/haw_volc.html | archive-date=December 29, 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref>

===Geology===

{{Main|Hawaii hotspot}}
[[File:Pāhoehoe lava meets Pacific.jpg|thumb|left|{{lang|haw|Pāhoehoe}} (smooth lava) spills into the Ocean, forming new rock.]]

The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea [[magma]] source called the [[Hawaii hotspot|Hawai{{okina}}i hotspot]]. The process is continuing to build islands; the [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] beneath much of the Pacific Ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes. Because of the hotspot's location, all currently active land volcanoes are located on the southern half of Hawai{{okina}}i Island. The newest volcano, [[Loihi Seamount|Lō{{okina}}ihi Seamount]], is located south of the coast of Hawai{{okina}}i Island.

The last volcanic eruption outside Hawai{{okina}}i Island occurred at {{lang|haw|[[Haleakalā]]|italic=no}} on Maui before the late 18th{{nbs}}century, possibly hundreds of years earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1999/99_09_09.html |title = Youngest lava flows on East Maui probably older than A.D. 1790 |publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] |date = September 9, 1999 |access-date = May 5, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20010222184841/http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1999/99_09_09.html |archive-date = February 22, 2001 |url-status = live }}</ref> In 1790, [[1790 Footprints|Kīlauea exploded]]; it was the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs074-97/ |title=Living on Active Volcanoes—The Island of Hawaii, U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 074-97 |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |access-date=November 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025021343/http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs074-97/ |archive-date=October 25, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Up to 5,405 warriors and their families marching on [[Kīlauea]] were killed by the eruption.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Swanson, D.

Because the islands of Hawai{{okina}}i are distant from other land habitats, life is thought to have arrived there by wind, waves (i.e. by ocean currents) and wings (i.e. birds, insects, and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers). This [[reproductive isolation|isolation]], in combination with the diverse environment (including extreme altitudes, tropical climates, and arid shorelines), allowed for the [[evolution]] of new endemic flora and fauna.

The extant main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean for fewer than 10{{nbs}}million years; a fraction of the time biological colonization and evolution have occurred there. The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field. On a single island, the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical (less than {{convert|20|in|mm|disp=or|sp=us}} annual rainfall) to wet tropical; on the slopes, environments range from tropical rainforest (more than {{convert|200|in|mm|disp=or|sp=us}} per year), through a temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold, dry climate. The rainy climate impacts soil development, which largely determines ground permeability, affecting the distribution of streams and wetlands.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Hawai{{okina}}i's climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of near-constant [[trade winds]] from the east. Summer highs usually reach around {{Convert|88|F|C}} during the day, with the temperature reaching a low of {{Convert|75|F|C}} at night. Winter day temperatures are usually around {{Convert|83|F|C}}; at low elevation they seldom dip below {{Convert|65|F|C}} at night. Snow, not usually associated with the tropics, falls at {{convert|4200|m|ft|order=flip}} on Mauna Kea and [[Mauna Loa]] on Hawaii Island in some winter months. Snow rarely falls on Haleakalā. [[Mount Waialeale|Mount Wai{{okina}}ale{{okina}}ale]] on Kaua{{okina}}i has the second-highest average annual rainfall on Earth, about {{convert|460|in|mm}} per year. Most of Hawaii experiences only two seasons; the dry season runs from May to October and the wet season is from October to April.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/pages/climate_summary.php |title=Climate of Hawaii |publisher=Prh.noaa.gov |access-date=November 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101041503/http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/pages/climate_summary.php |archive-date=November 1, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==

{{Main|History of Hawaii}}
{{HI history}}

Hawai{{okina}}i is one of two states that were widely recognized independent nations prior to joining the United States. The [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|the monarchy was overthrown]] by resident American and European capitalists and landholders. Hawai{{okina}}i was an independent republic from 1894 until August 12, 1898, when it officially became a territory of the United States. Hawai{{okina}}i was admitted as a U.S. state on August 21, 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netstate.com/states/government/hi_government.htm |title=Hawaii State Government |publisher=Netstate.com |access-date=November 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019022737/http://netstate.com/states/government/hi_government.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===First human settlement—Ancient Hawai{{okina}}i (800–1778)===

{{Main|Ancient Hawaii}}

Based on archaeological evidence, the earliest habitation of the Hawaiian Islands dates to around 300 CE, probably by Polynesian settlers from the [[Marquesas Islands]].{{doubtful|date=May 2018}} A second wave of migration from [[Raiatea]] and [[Bora Bora]] took place in the {{ordinal|11}} century. The date of the human discovery and habitation of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of academic debate.<ref>{{cite book | first = Patrick Vinton | last = Kirch | author-link = Patrick Vinton Kirch | title = The Evolution of the Polynesian Chiefdoms | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1989 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/evolutionofpolyn0000kirc/page/77 77–79] | isbn = 978-0-521-27316-9 | url = https://archive.org/details/evolutionofpolyn0000kirc/page/77 }}</ref> Some archaeologists and historians think it was a later wave of immigrants from [[Tahiti]] around 1000 CE who introduced a new line of high chiefs, the [[kapu]] system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the building of ''[[heiau]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} This later immigration is detailed in [[Hawaiian mythology]] (''mo{{okina}}olelo'') about [[Pa'ao|Pa{{okina}}ao]]. Other authors say there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of Tahitian settlers and that Pa{{okina}}ao must be regarded as a myth.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The history of the islands is marked by a slow, steady growth in population and the size of the [[chiefdoms]], which grew to encompass whole islands. Local chiefs, called [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]], ruled their settlements, and launched wars to extend their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals. Ancient Hawai{{okina}}i was a [[Makaainana|caste]]-based society, much like that of Hindus in India.<ref>{{cite book | first = Barbara A. | last = West | year = 2009 | url = {{google books |plainurl=y|id=pCiNqFj3MQsC|page=270}} | title = Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania | publisher = Infobase Publishing | page = 270 | isbn = 978-1438119137}}</ref>

===European arrival===

The 1778 arrival of British explorer [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] marked the first documented contact by a European explorer with Hawai{{okina}}i. Cook named the archipelago "the Sandwich Islands" in honor of his sponsor [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]], publishing the islands' location and rendering the native name as ''Owyhee''. The form [[Owyhee (disambiguation)|'Owyhee' or 'Owhyhee']] is preserved in the names of certain locations in the American part of the Pacific Northwest, among them [[Owyhee County, Idaho|Owyhee County]] and [[Owyhee Mountains]] in [[Idaho]], named after three native Hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Name Owyhee|url=http://www.history.idaho.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/reference-series/0036.pdf|publisher=Idaho State Historical Society|access-date=January 1, 2015|date=August 1964|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816231420/http://history.idaho.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/reference-series/0036.pdf|archive-date=August 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

It is very possible that [[Conquistador|Spanish explorers]] arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the 16th century, two hundred years before Cook's first documented visit in 1778. [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] commanded a fleet of six ships that left [[Acapulco]] in 1542 bound for the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot. Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports describe an encounter with either Hawai{{okina}}i or the [[Marshall Islands]].<ref name=Kane>{{cite book| last = Kane| first = Herb Kawainui| author-link = Herb Kawainui Kane| editor = Bob Dye| chapter = The Manila Galleons| title = Hawaii Chronicles: Island History from the Pages of Honolulu Magazine| volume = I| publisher = [[University of Hawaii Press]]| year = 1996| location = Honolulu| pages = 25–32| isbn = 978-0-8248-1829-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://heroesdehispania.blogspot.se/2014/05/ruy-lopez-de-villalobos-descubridor-de.html|title=Ruy López de Villalobos (descubridor de Hawai)|website=heroesdehispania.blogspot.se|language=es|access-date=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106011530/http://heroesdehispania.blogspot.se/2014/05/ruy-lopez-de-villalobos-descubridor-de.html|archive-date=January 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Blogs are not considered [[W:RS|reliable sources]].|date=January 2017}} If de Villalobos' crew spotted Hawai{{okina}}i, Gaetano would thus be considered the first European to see the islands.

Nonetheless, Spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands at the same latitude as Hawai{{okina}}i, but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands. In this manuscript, the island of Maui is named ''La Desgraciada'' (The Unfortunate Island), and what appears to be Hawai{{okina}}i Island is named ''La Mesa'' (The Table).

Despite such contested claims, Cook is generally credited as being the first European to land at Hawai{{okina}}i, having visited the Hawaiian Islands twice. As he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779, a quarrel ensued as Cook took temple idols and fencing as "firewood",<ref>Stanley D. Porteus, ''Calabashes and Kings: An Introduction to Hawaii.'' Kessinger Publishing, 2005; p. 17</ref> and a minor chief and his men stole a boat from his ship. Cook abducted the [[Alii Aimoku of Hawaii|King of Hawai{{okina}}i Island]], [[Kalaniʻōpuʻu|Kalani{{okina}}ōpu{{okina}}u]], and held him for ransom aboard his ship in order to gain return of Cook's boat, as this tactic had previously worked in Tahiti and other islands.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kuykendall |title=The Hawaiian Kingdom Volume I: Foundation and Transformation |page=18 |quote=Cook's plan was to get the king on board the Resolution and keep him there until the stolen boat was returned—a plan that had been effective under similar circumstances in the south Pacific.}}</ref> Instead, the supporters of Kalani{{okina}}ōpu{{okina}}u attacked, killing Cook and four sailors as Cook's party retreated along the beach to their ship. The ship departed without retrieving the stolen boat.

After Cook's visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages, the Hawaiian Islands attracted many European visitors: explorers, traders, and eventually whalers, who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies. Early British influence can be seen in the design of the [[Flag of Hawaii|flag of Hawai{{okina}}i]], which bears the [[Union Jack]] in the top-left corner. These visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands, causing the Hawaiian population to drop precipitously.<ref name="EB">{{Britannica|257332}}</ref> Native Hawaiians had no resistance to Eurasian diseases, such as [[influenza]], [[smallpox]] and [[measles]].

[[File:Kamehameha Statue and flag.jpg|thumb|Kamehameha I conquered the Hawaiian Islands and established a unified monarchy across the archipelago.]]

During the 1780s, and 1790s, chiefs often fought for power. After a series of battles that ended in 1795, all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler, who became known as [[Kamehameha I|King Kamehameha the Great]]. He established the [[House of Kamehameha]], a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fry|first1=Kathie|title=Kamehameha Dynasty|url=http://www.hawaiiforvisitors.com/monarchy/kamehameha-dynasty.htm|website=Hawaii for Visitors|access-date=November 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107221138/http://www.hawaiiforvisitors.com/monarchy/kamehameha-dynasty.htm|archive-date=November 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The death of the bachelor [[Kamehameha V|King Kamehameha V]]—who did not name an heir—resulted in the popular election of [[Lunalilo]] over [[Kalākaua]]. Lunalilo died the next year, also without naming an heir. In 1874, the election was contested within the legislature between Kalākaua and [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Emma, Queen Consort of Kamehameha IV]]. After riots broke out, the United States and Britain landed troops on the islands to restore order.

====1887 Constitution and overthrow preparations====

In 1887, Kalākaua was forced to sign the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. Drafted by white businessmen and lawyers, the document stripped the king of much of his authority. It established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised most Hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier, white elite. Resident whites were allowed to vote but resident Asians were not. As the 1887 Constitution was signed under threat of violence, it is known as the Bayonet Constitution. King Kalākaua, reduced to a figurehead, reigned until his death in 1891. His sister, Queen [[Liliuokalani|Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], succeeded him; she was the last monarch of Hawai{{okina}}i.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=d-0kingdom3-000Sec--11en-50-20-frameset-book--1-010escapewin&a=d&d=D0.21&toc=0|title=Ulukau: The Hawaiian kingdom, vol. 3, 1874–1893, The Kalakaua dynasty|website=www.ulukau.org|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120043915/http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=d-0kingdom3-000Sec--11en-50-20-frameset-book--1-010escapewin&a=d&d=D0.21&toc=0|archive-date=January 20, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1893, Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani announced plans for a new constitution to proclaim herself an absolute monarch. On January 14, 1893, a group of mostly Euro-American business leaders and residents formed the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] to stage a [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|coup d'état]] against the kingdom and seek annexation by the United States. United States Government Minister [[John L. Stevens]], responding to a request from the Committee of Safety, summoned a company of U.S. Marines. The Queen's soldiers did not resist. According to historian William Russ, the monarchy was unable to protect itself.<ref name="Adam">{{cite book | last = Russ | first = William Adam | title = The Hawaiian Revolution (1893–94) | publisher=Associated University Presses | year = 1992 | page = 350 | isbn = 978-0-945636-43-4}}</ref>

On January 17, 1893, Queen [[Liliʻuokalani|Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] was overthrown and replaced by a provisional government composed of members of the Committee of Safety. The United States Minister to the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] ([[John L. Stevens]]) conspired with U.S. citizens to overthrow the monarchy.<ref name="HIgpo"/> After the overthrow, Lawyer [[Sanford B. Dole]], a citizen of Hawaii, became President of the Republic when the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|Provisional Government of Hawai{{okina}}i]] ended on July 4, 1894. Controversy ensued in the following years as the Queen tried to regain her throne. The administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]] commissioned the [[Blount Report]], which concluded that the removal of Lili{{okina}}uokalani had been illegal. The U.S. government first demanded that Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani be reinstated, but the Provisional Government refused.

Congress conducted an independent investigation, and on February 26, 1894, submitted the [[Morgan Report]], which found all parties, including Minister Stevens—with the exception of the Queen—"not guilty" and not responsible for the coup.<ref>{{cite book| author=Kuykendall, R.S. |year=1967 |title=The Hawaiian Kingdom, 1874–1893 |location=Honolulu |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |page=648}}</ref> Partisans on both sides of the debate questioned the accuracy and impartiality of both the Blount and Morgan reports over the events of 1893.<ref name="Adam"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Kinzer | first = Stephen | title = Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change From Hawaii to Iraq | publisher = Times Books | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8050-7861-9 | url = https://archive.org/details/overthrowamerica00kinz }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Hawaii Reporter|url=http://www.hawaiireporter.com/rush-limbaugh-sounds-off-on-akaka-bill/123|title=Rush Limbaugh Sounds Off on Akaka Bill|date=August 18, 2005|access-date=February 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512101435/http://www.hawaiireporter.com/rush-limbaugh-sounds-off-on-akaka-bill/123|archive-date=May 12, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name = "HDAICS">{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/hi5/bigfiles3/AkakaHawaiiDividedFeinJune2005.pdf |title=Hawaii Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand |first=Bruce |last=Fein |author-link=Bruce Fein |date=June 6, 2005 |publisher=[[Grassroot Institute of Hawaii]] |location=Honolulu |access-date=May 7, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205112419/http://www.hawaiireporter.com/file.aspx?Guid=aefef5f6-a533-486a-9459-691138355dd1 |archive-date=February 5, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1993, the US Congress passed a joint [[Apology Resolution]] regarding the overthrow; it was signed by President [[Bill Clinton]]. The resolution apologized and said that the overthrow was illegal in the following phrase: "The Congress—on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the illegal overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i on January 17, 1893, acknowledges the historical significance of this event which resulted in the suppression of the inherent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people."<ref name="HIgpo">{{cite web|title=Public Law 103-150—November 23, 1993|website=gpo.gov|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-107/pdf/STATUTE-107-Pg1510.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407014005/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-107/pdf/STATUTE-107-Pg1510.pdf|archive-date=April 7, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref> The Apology Resolution also "acknowledges that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i or through a plebiscite or referendum".<ref name = "HDAICS"/><ref name="HIgpo"/>

After [[William McKinley]] won the 1896 U.S. presidential election, advocates pressed to annex the Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i.

In 1900, Hawai{{okina}}i was granted self-governance and retained [[Iolani Palace|{{okina}}Iolani Palace]] as the territorial capitol building. Despite several attempts to become a state, Hawaii remained a territory for 60 years. Plantation owners and capitalists, who maintained control through financial institutions such as the [[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]], found territorial status convenient because they remained able to import cheap, foreign labor. Such immigration and labor practices were prohibited in many states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.co.uk/Hawaii-Statehood-Honolulu-Star-Bulletin/7223272607/bd|title=Hawaii Statehood—Honolulu Star-Bulletin by HAWAII: Honolulu, Hawaii No binding—Seth Kaller Inc|website=www.abebooks.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213164159/https://www.abebooks.co.uk/Hawaii-Statehood-Honolulu-Star-Bulletin/7223272607/bd|archive-date=February 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1950s, the power of the plantation owners was broken by the descendants of immigrant laborers, who were born in Hawai{{okina}}i and were U.S. citizens. They voted against the [[Hawaii Republican Party|Hawai{{okina}}i Republican Party]], strongly supported by plantation owners. The new majority voted for the [[Democratic Party of Hawaii|Democratic Party of Hawai{{okina}}i]], which dominated territorial and state politics for more than 40 years. Eager to gain full representation in Congress and the Electoral College, residents actively campaigned for statehood. In Washington there was talk that Hawai{{okina}}i would be a Republican Party stronghold so it was matched with the admission of Alaska, seen as a Democratic Party stronghold. These predictions turned out to be inaccurate; today, Hawai{{okina}}i votes Democratic predominantly, while Alaska votes Republican.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/188969/red-states-outnumber-blue-first-time-gallup-tracking.aspx|title=Red States Outnumber Blue for First Time in Gallup Tracking|first=Gallup|last=Inc.|website=gallup.com|access-date=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104092539/http://www.gallup.com/poll/188969/red-states-outnumber-blue-first-time-gallup-tracking.aspx|archive-date=January 4, 2017|url-status=live|date=February 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>[ 2016 election result—Politico]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/modern-political-parties-59/red-states-vs-blue-states-337-4262/|title=Red States vs. Blue States|last=Boundless|date=August 8, 2016|website=Boundless.com|access-date=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112151613/https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/modern-political-parties-59/red-states-vs-blue-states-337-4262/|archive-date=November 12, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/all/president/|title=2012 Presidential Race—Election Results by State—NBC News|date=December 2, 2011|website=nbcnews.com|access-date=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106174223/http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/all/president/|archive-date=January 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

After Europeans and mainland Americans first arrived during the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] period, the overall population of Hawaii, until that time composed solely of indigenous Hawaiians, fell dramatically. The indigenous Hawaiian population succumbed to foreign diseases, declining from 300,000 in the 1770s, to 60,000 in the 1850s, to 24,000 in 1920. In that year 43% of the population was of Japanese descent.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} The population of Hawaii began to finally increase after an influx of primarily Asian settlers that arrived as migrant laborers at the end of the 19th{{nbs}}century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiianencyclopedia.com/population-and-visitor-statist.asp |title=Hawaiian Encyclopedia : Population and Visitor Statistics |publisher=Hawaiianencyclopedia.com |date=July 1, 2002 |access-date=January 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214051108/http://www.hawaiianencyclopedia.com/population-and-visitor-statist.asp |archive-date=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The unmixed indigenous Hawaiian population has still not restored itself to its 300,000 pre-contact level. {{as of|2010}}, only 156,000 persons declared themselves to be of Native Hawaiian-only ancestry, just over half the pre-contact level Native Hawaiian population, although an additional 371,000 persons declared themselves to possess Native Hawaiian ancestry in combination with one or more other races (including other Polynesian groups, but mostly Asian and/or Caucasian).

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates the population of Hawaii was 1,420,491 on July 1, 2018; an increase of 4.42% since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name="PopEstUS">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/hi,US/PST045218|title=QuickFacts Hawaii; UNITED STATES|website=2018 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=March 10, 2019|access-date=March 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230041652/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/hi,US/PST045218|archive-date=December 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{As of|2018}}, Hawaii had an estimated population of 1,420,491; a decrease of 7,047 from the previous year and an increase of 60,190 (4.42%) since 2010. This includes a natural increase of 48,111 (96,028 births minus 47,917 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 16,956 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 30,068; migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,112 people.

Before the arrival of Captain James Cook, the Hawaiian language had no written form. That form was developed mainly by American Protestant missionaries between 1820 and 1826 who assigned to the Hawaiian phonemes letters from the Latin alphabet. Interest in Hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th century. With the help of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, specially designated immersion schools in which all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian were established. The [[University of Hawaii System|University of Hawaii]] developed a Hawaiian language graduate studies program. Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Hawaiian distinguishes between [[vowel length|long and short vowel sounds]]. In modern practice, vowel length is indicated with a [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] (''[[Hawaiian language#Orthography (writing system)|kahakō]]''). Hawaiian-language newspapers (''nūpepa'') published from 1834 to 1948 and traditional native speakers of Hawaiian generally omit the marks in their own writing. The ʻokina and kahakō are intended to help non-native speakers.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The Hawaiian language uses the [[glottal stop]] (''[[ʻOkina|ʻokina]]'') as a consonant. It is written as a symbol similar to the apostrophe or left-hanging (opening) single quotation mark.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The keyboard layout used for Hawaiian is [[QWERTY]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/dev/keyboards/layouts/haw.html|title=Layouts: Hawaiian (haw)|website=unicode.org|access-date=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525013041/http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/dev/keyboards/layouts/haw.html|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Hawaiian Pidgin ====

Some residents of Hawaii speak [[Hawaiian Pidgin|Hawaiʻi Creole English]] (HCE), endonymically called ''pidgin'' or ''pidgin English''. The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. During the 19th century, the increase in immigration—mainly from China, Japan, Portugal—especially from the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], and Spain—catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as ''pidgin''. By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ''ahi''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

HCE speakers have modified the meanings of some English words. For example, "aunty" and "uncle" may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder. [[Syntax]] and [[grammar]] follow distinctive rules different from those of General American English. For example, instead of "it is hot today, isn't it?", an HCE speaker would say simply "stay hot, eh?"{{efn|English "to be" is often omitted in Pidgin. In contexts where "to be" is used in [[General American]], "to stay" is preferred. "To stay" may have arisen due to an English calque of the Portuguese ''[[wikt:ser#Portuguese|ser]]'', ''[[wikt:estar#Portuguese|estar]]'', or ''[[wikt:ficar#Portuguese|ficar]]''. ''Eh?'' ({{IPA-all|æ̃ː˧˦}}) is a [[tag question]] which may have roots in Japanese, which utilizes ね (ne?) to emphasize a point that may be agreed upon by all parties, or may come from Portuguese [[wikt:né#Portuguese|né?]] (shortened from "[[wikt:não é#Portuguese|não é?]]"), cf. French [[wikt:n'est-ce pas#French|n'est-ce pas ?]]. ''Eh?'' may also have come from English ''yeah''.}} The term ''[[da kine]]'' is used as a [[filler (linguistics)|filler]]; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase. During the [[surfing]] boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang. Some HCE expressions, such as ''brah'' and ''da kine'', have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==== Hawaiʻi Sign Language ====

[[Hawaiʻi Sign Language]], a [[sign language]] for the deaf based on the Hawaiian language, has been in use in the islands since the early 1800s. It is dwindling in numbers due to [[American Sign Language]] supplanting HSL through schooling and various other domains.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Christianity is the most widespread religion in Hawaii, mainly represented by various [[Protestants]], [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Mormons]]. The second-most popular religion is [[Buddhism]], especially among the archipelago's Japanese community. Unaffiliated account for one-quarter of the population.

The [[Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew (Honolulu)|Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew]] in Honolulu was formally the seat of the [[Church of Hawaii|Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church]]. When the Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church, a province of the [[Anglican Communion]], was merged into the [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopal Church]] in the 1890s following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, it became the seat of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii]]. The [[Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace]] and the [[Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus (Honolulu, Hawaii)|Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus]] serve as seats of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu]]. The Eastern Orthodox community is centered around the [[Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Pacific (Honolulu)|Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Pacific]].

=== LGBT ===

Hawaii has had a long history of [[LGBT]] identities. ''[[Māhū]]'' ("in the middle") were a precolonization [[third gender]] with traditional spiritual and social roles; ''māhū'' were a respected group of people widely regarded as healers. The concept of ''[[aikāne]]'' referred to homosexual relationships, widely accepted as a normal part of ancient Hawaiian society.<ref name="Murray2002">{{cite book|author=Stephen O.

Cook's second lieutenant and co-astronomer [[James King (Royal Navy officer)|James King]] observed that "all the chiefs had them", and recounts that Cook was actually asked by one chief to leave King behind, considering the role a great honor.

According to Hawaiian scholar [[Lilikalā Kameʻeleihiwa]], "If you didn't sleep with a man, how could you trust him when you went into battle? How would you know if he was going to be the warrior that would protect you at all costs, if he wasn't your lover?"<ref name="mahu">{{cite AV media |people= Xian, Kathryn and Brent Anbe (Directors)|year= 2001|title= ''Ke Kūlana He Māhū'': Remembering a Sense of Place|medium= DVD}}</ref>

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the word ''aikāne'' was [[Expurgation|expurgated]] of its original sexual meaning by colonialism, and in print simply meant "friend". Nonetheless, in Hawaiian language publications its metaphorical meaning can still mean either "friend" or "lover" without stigmatization.<ref>{{cite book|author=Noenoe K.

Hawaii's very high [[cost of living]] is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic U.S. government trade policy. Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year, such as areas of [[California]], [[Arizona]] and [[Florida]], Hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a "[[Sunshine tax]]". This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many [[island country|island states and territories]] suffer from as well.

The higher costs to ship goods across an ocean may be further increased by the requirements of the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]], which generally requires that goods be transported between places within the U.S., including between the mainland U.S. west coast and Hawaii, using only U.S.-owned, built, and crewed ships. Jones Act-compliant vessels are often more expensive to build and operate than foreign equivalents, which can drive up shipping costs. While the Jones Act does not affect transportation of goods to Hawaii directly from Asia, this type of trade is nonetheless not common; this is a result of other primarily economic reasons including additional costs associated with stopping over in Hawaii (e.g. pilot and port fees), the market size of Hawaii, and the economics of using ever-larger ships that cannot be handled in Hawaii for transoceanic voyages. Therefore, Hawaii relies on receiving most inbound goods on Jones Act-qualified vessels originating from the U.S. west coast, which may contribute to the increased cost of some consumer goods and therefore the overall cost of living.<ref name="Keeping up with the Jones Act">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |title=Keeping up with the Jones Act |date=August 2012 |website=[[Hawaii Business Magazine]] |publisher=PacificBasin Communications |location=Honolulu, HI |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823083544/http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |archive-date=August 23, 2012 |url-status=live|access-date=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name="U.S. Law Restricting Foreign Ships Leads to Higher Gas Prices">{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|title=Jones Act Does Not Bar International Trade From Hawaii|last=Hansen|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2013|publisher=Hawaiʻi Free Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaiʻi|access-date=July 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728040004/http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|archive-date=July 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Critics of the Jones Act contend that Hawaii consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act.<ref name="Star-Bulletin on Jones Act">{{cite news |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/97/04/08/business/story3.html |title=U.S.-only shipping rule praised, blasted; Backers and foes of the Jones Act make their case before the Legislature |first=Russ |last=Lynch |newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date=April 4, 1997 |location=Honolulu, HI |publisher=[[Black Press|Black Press Group Ltd]] |issn=0439-5271 |id={{OCLC|9188300|433678262|232117605|2268098}} |access-date=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013185712/http://archives.starbulletin.com/97/04/08/business/story3.html |archive-date=October 13, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Culture==

{{Main|Culture of the Native Hawaiians}}

The aboriginal culture of Hawaii is Polynesian. Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast [[Polynesian Triangle]] of the south and central Pacific Ocean. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Some of these cultural influences, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of ''[[luau|lū{{okina}}au]]'' and ''[[hula]]'', are strong enough to affect the wider United States.

===Cuisine===

{{Main|Cuisine of Hawaii}}
[[File:Man with a Yoke Carrying Taro by Joseph Strong, oil on canvas board, 1880, Honolulu Museum of Art, accession 12692.1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of a man carrying taro by a yoke.|[[Taro]], or in Hawaiian ''kalo'', was one of the primary staples in Ancient Hawaii and remains a central ingredient in Hawaiian gastronomy today.]]

The [[cuisine of Hawaii]] is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and [[Native Hawaiian cuisine]], and [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Polynesian cuisine|Polynesian]], [[Puerto Rican cuisine|Puerto Rican]], and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] origins. Plant and animal food sources are imported from around the world for agricultural use in Hawaii. ''[[Poi (food)|Poi]]'', a starch made by pounding [[taro]], is one of the traditional foods of the islands. Many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous [[plate lunch]], which features two scoops of rice, a simplified version of American [[macaroni salad]] and a variety of toppings including [[hamburger]] patties, a fried egg, and [[gravy]] of a ''[[loco moco]]'', Japanese style ''[[tonkatsu]]'' or the traditional lū{{okina}}au favorites, including ''[[kalua|kālua]]'' pork and ''[[laulau]]''. ''[[Spam musubi]]'' is an example of the fusion of ethnic cuisine that developed on the islands among the mix of immigrant groups and military personnel. In the 1990s, a group of chefs developed [[Hawaii regional cuisine]] as a contemporary fusion cuisine.

===Customs and etiquette===

{{Main|Customs and etiquette in Hawaii}}

Some key customs and etiquette in Hawaii are as follows: when visiting a home, it is considered good manners to bring a small gift for one's host (for example, a dessert). Thus, parties are usually in the form of potlucks. Most locals take their shoes off before entering a home. It is customary for Hawaiian families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday. It is also customary at Hawaiian weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a money dance (also called the [[pandanggo]]). Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as "locals of Hawaii" or "people of Hawaii".

===Hawaiian mythology===

{{Main|Hawaiian mythology}}
[[File:Ethnologisches Museum Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 009.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone carving of a Hawaiian deity, housed at a German museum]]

Hawaiian mythology includes the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people. It is considered a variant of a more general [[Polynesian mythology]] that developed a unique character for several centuries before ''circa'' 1800. It is associated with the [[Hawaiian religion]], which was officially suppressed in the 19th century but was kept alive by some practitioners to the modern day.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Prominent figures and terms include [[Aumakua]], the spirit of an ancestor or family god and [[Kāne]], the highest of the four major Hawaiian deities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Polynesian mythology===

{{Main|Polynesian mythology}}
[[File:Tahiti-Oro.jpg|thumb|upright|A sacred god figure wrapping for the war god [['Oro]], made of woven dried coconut fibre ([[sennit]]), which would have protected a Polynesian god effigy (''to'o''), made of wood]]

Polynesian mythology is the [[oral tradition]]s of the people of Polynesia, a grouping of Central and South Pacific Ocean island [[archipelago]]s in the [[Polynesian triangle]] together with the scattered cultures known as the [[Polynesian outliers]]. Polynesians speak languages that descend from a language reconstructed as [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] that was probably spoken in the area around Tonga and Samoa in around 1000 BCE.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kirch|first=Patrick Vinton|title=Hawaiki, Ancestral Polynesia: An Essay in Historical Anthropology|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78309-5|pages=99–119|author2=Roger Green }}</ref>

Prior to the 15th century, [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian people]] migrated east to the [[Cook Islands]], and from there to other island groups such as Tahiti and the [[Marquesas]]. Their descendants later discovered the islands Tahiti, Rapa Nui and later the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Polynesian languages are part of the Austronesian language family. Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organization, childrearing, horticulture, building and textile technologies. Their mythologies in particular demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales. The Polynesian cultures each have distinct but related oral traditions; legends or myths are traditionally considered to recount ancient history (the time of "pō") and the adventures of gods ("[[atua]]") and deified ancestors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===List of state parks===

{{Main|List of Hawaiian state parks}}

There are [[list of Hawaiian state parks|many Hawaiian state parks]].
* The [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] has state parks, recreation areas, and historical parks.
* [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] has the [[Ahukini State Recreation Pier]], six state parks, and the [[Russian Fort Elizabeth State Historical Park]].
* [[Maui]] has two state monuments, several state parks, and the [[Polipoli Spring State Recreation Area]]. [[Moloka'i]] has the [[Pala'au State Park]].
* [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] has several state parks, a number of state recreation areas, and a number of monuments, including the [[Ulu Pō Heiau State Monument]].

===Literature===

{{Main|Literature in Hawaii}}

The literature of Hawaii is diverse and includes authors [[Kiana Davenport]], [[Lois-Ann Yamanaka]], and [[Kaui Hart Hemmings]]. Hawaiian magazines include ''[[Hana Hou!]]'', ''[[Hawaii Business Magazine]]'' and ''[[Honolulu (magazine)|Honolulu]]'', among others.

===Music===

{{Main|Music of Hawaii}}

The music of Hawaii includes traditional and popular styles, ranging from native Hawaiian folk music to modern [[rock music|rock]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Hawaii's musical contributions to the [[music of the United States]] are out of proportion to the state's small size.

Styles such as [[slack-key guitar]] are well known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] soundtracks. Hawaii also made a major contribution to [[country music]] with the introduction of the [[steel guitar]].<ref name="Unterberger">{{cite book|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Music USA|isbn=978-1-85828-421-7|location=London|publisher=Rough Guides|year=1999|pages=[https://archive.org/details/musicusaroughgui0000unte/page/465 465–473]|url=https://archive.org/details/musicusaroughgui0000unte/page/465}}</ref>

Traditional Hawaiian folk music is a major part of the state's musical heritage. The Hawaiian people have inhabited the islands for centuries and have retained much of their traditional musical knowledge. Their music is largely religious in nature, and includes chanting and dance music.

Hawaiian music has had an enormous impact on the [[Polynesian music|music of other Polynesian islands]]; according to Peter Manuel, the influence of Hawaiian music a "unifying factor in the development of modern Pacific musics".<ref name="Manuel">{{cite book|last=Manuel|first=Peter|title=Popular Musics of the Non-Western World|url=https://archive.org/details/popularmusicsofn0000manu|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-19-506334-9|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|pages=[https://archive.org/details/popularmusicsofn0000manu/page/236 236–241]}}</ref> Native Hawaiian musician and Hawaiian sovereignty activist [[Israel Kamakawiwoʻole]], famous for his medley of "[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World]]", was named "The Voice of Hawaii" by [[NPR]] in 2010 in its 50 great voices series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kamakawiwo|first=Israel|publisher=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/06/131812500/israel-kamakawiwo-ole-the-voice-of-hawaii|title=Israel Kamakawiwo'ole: The Voice Of Hawaii|date=December 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416062754/http://www.npr.org/2010/12/06/131812500/israel-kamakawiwo-ole-the-voice-of-hawaii|archive-date=April 16, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=April 16, 2017}}</ref>

===Sports===

[[File:Surfing contest - oahu hawaii - north shore - oct 2015.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=6|right|[[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]]]

[[Surfing]] has been a central part of [[Polynesian culture]] for centuries. Since the late 19th century, Hawaii has become a major site for surfists from around the world. Notable competitions include the [[Triple Crown of Surfing]] and [[The Eddie]].

The only [[NCAA Division I]] team in Hawaii is the [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors and Rainbow Wahine]], which competes at the [[Big West Conference]] (major sports), [[Mountain West Conference]] (football) and [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]] (minor sports). There are three teams in NCAA Division II: [[Chaminade Silverswords]], [[Hawaii Pacific Sharks]] and Hawaii-Hilo Vulcans, all of which compete at the [[Pacific West Conference]].

Notable college sports events in Hawaii include the [[Maui Invitational Tournament]], [[Diamond Head Classic]] (basketball) and [[Hawaii Bowl]] (football).

Notable professional teams include [[The Hawaiians (WFL)|The Hawaiians]], which played at the [[World Football League]] in 1974 and 1975; the [[Hawaii Islanders]], a Triple-A minor league baseball team that played at the [[Pacific Coast League]] from 1961 to 1987; and [[Team Hawaii]], a [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] team that played in 1977.

Tourism is an important part of the Hawaiian economy. In 2003, according to state government data, there were more than 6.4{{nbs}}million visitors, with expenditures of over $10{{nbs}}billion, to the Hawaiian Islands.<ref name="DBEDT 2003">{{cite journal|author=Hawaii State DBEDT|title=Overview of All Visitors|journal=Summary of 2003 Visitors to Hawaii|year=2003|page=2|url=http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/visitor-stats/visitor-research/2003-annual-visitor.pdf|access-date=February 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209224525/http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/visitor-stats/visitor-research/2003-annual-visitor.pdf|archive-date=December 9, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to the mild year-round weather, tourist travel is popular throughout the year. The major holidays are the most popular times for outsiders to visit, especially in the winter months. Substantial numbers of Japanese tourists still visit the islands but have now been surpassed by Chinese and Koreans due to the collapse of the value of the Yen and the weak Japanese economy. The average Japanese stays only five days, while other Asians stay over 9.5 days and spend 25% more.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/visitor/tourism/2015/Oct15.pdf|title = Tourism stats|last = Hawaii.gov|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160101023521/http://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/visitor/tourism/2015/Oct15.pdf|archive-date = January 1, 2016|url-status = live}}</ref>

==Health==

{{Main|Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act}}

{{As of|2009}}, Hawaii's health care system insures 92% of residents. Under the state's plan, businesses are required to provide insurance to employees who work more than twenty hours per week. Heavy regulation of insurance companies helps reduce the cost to employers. Due in part to heavy emphasis on preventive care, Hawaiians require hospital treatment less frequently than the rest of the United States, while total health care expenses measured as a percentage of state GDP are substantially lower.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Proponents of [[universal health care]] elsewhere in the U.S. sometimes use Hawaii as a model for proposed federal and state health care plans.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Hawaii has the only school system within the U.S. that is unified statewide. Policy decisions are made by the fourteen-member state [[Hawaii Board of Education|Board of Education]], which sets policy and hires the superintendent of schools, who oversees the state '''Department of Education'''. The Department of Education is divided into seven districts; four on O{{okina}}ahu and one for each of the other three counties.

Public elementary, middle and high school test scores in Hawaii are below national averages on tests mandated under the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. The Hawaii Board of Education requires all eligible students to take these tests and report all student test scores. This may have unbalanced the results that reported in August 2005 that of 282 schools across the state, 185 failed to reach federal minimum performance standards in mathematics and reading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/education/4870699/detail.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318182117/http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/education/4870699/detail.html |archive-date=March 18, 2007 |title=Two-Thirds of Hawaii Schools Do Not Meet Requirements—Education News Story—KITV Honolulu |publisher=Thehawaiichannel.com |date=August 18, 2005 |access-date=May 15, 2010}}</ref> The [[ACT (examination)|ACT college placement tests]] show that in 2005, seniors scored slightly above the national average (21.9 compared with 20.9),<ref>Honolulu Advertiser, August 17, 2005, p.

Independent and charter schools can select their students, while the public schools are open to all students in their district. The Kamehameha Schools are the only schools in the U.S. that openly grant admission to students based on ancestry; collectively, they are one of the wealthiest schools in the United States, if not the world, having over eleven billion [[US dollars]] in estate assets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksbe.edu/assets/annual_reports/KS_Annual_Report_2014.pdf |title=Kamehameha Schools 2013–2014 Annual Report |access-date=September 28, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603160954/http://www.ksbe.edu/assets/annual_reports/KS_Annual_Report_2014.pdf |archive-date=June 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2005, Kamehameha enrolled 5,398 students, 8.4% of the Native Hawaiian children in the state.<ref>

==Transportation==

[[File:HonoluluAirportWelcomeSign.jpg|thumb|Honolulu International Airport]]

A [[List of Hawaii state highways|system of state highways]] encircles each main island. Only O{{okina}}ahu has federal highways, and is the only area outside the contiguous 48 states to have signed [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]]. Narrow, winding roads and congestion in populated places can slow traffic. Each major island has a public bus system.

[[Honolulu International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA]]:{{nbs}}HNL), which shares runways with the adjacent [[Hickam Field]] (IATA:{{nbs}}HIK), is the major commercial aviation hub of Hawaii. The commercial aviation airport offers intercontinental service to North America, Asia, Australia and Oceania. [[Hawaiian Airlines]], [[Mokulele Airlines]] and [[go! (airline)|go!]] use jets to provide services between the large airports in Honolulu, Līhu{{okina}}e, Kahului, Kona and Hilo. [[Island Air (Hawaii)|Island Air]] and [[Pacific Wings]] serve smaller airports. These airlines also provide air freight services between the islands. On May 30, 2017, the airport was officially renamed as the [[Daniel K. Inouye International Airport]] (HNL), after U.S. Senator [[Daniel Inouye|Daniel K. Inouye]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hidot.hawaii.gov/blog/2017/05/30/hawaiis-biggest-airport-officially-renamed-daniel-k-inouye-international-airport/|title=Department of Transportation—Hawaii's biggest airport officially renamed Daniel K.

===Rail===

At one time Hawaii had a network of railroads on each of the larger islands that transported farm commodities and passengers. Most were {{RailGauge|3ft}} [[narrow gauge]] systems but there were some {{RailGauge|2ft6in}} gauge on some of the smaller islands. The standard gauge in the U.S. is {{RailGauge|4ft8.5in}}. By far the largest railroad was the [[Oahu Railway and Land Company]] (OR&L) that ran lines from Honolulu across the western and northern part of Oahu.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Railway Album—WW II Photographs Vol 2 |author1=Norton Jr., Victor |author2=Treiber, Gale E. |year=2005 |publisher=Railroad Press |location=Hanover, PA}}</ref>

The OR&L was important for moving troops and goods during World War II. Traffic on this line was busy enough for signals to be used to facilitate movement of trains and to require [[wigwag (railroad)|wigwag]] signals at some railroad crossings for the protection of motorists. The main line was officially abandoned in 1947, although part of it was bought by the U.S. Navy and operated until 1970. {{convert|13|mi|km|spell=In}} of track remain; preservationists occasionally run trains over a portion of this line.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The [[Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project]] aims to add elevated passenger rail on Oahu to relieve highway congestion.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

{{See also|List of counties in Hawaii}}

The movement of the Hawaiian royal family from Hawai{{okina}}i Island to Maui, and subsequently to O{{okina}}ahu, explains the modern-day distribution of population centers. [[Kamehameha III]] chose the largest city, Honolulu, as his capital because of its natural harbor—the present-day [[Honolulu Harbor]]. Now the state capital, Honolulu is located along the southeast coast of O{{okina}}ahu. The previous capital was [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]], Maui, and before that [[Kailua-Kona]], Hawai{{okina}}i. Some major towns are [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]; [[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]]; [[Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii|Kailua]]; [[Pearl City, Hawaii|Pearl City]]; [[Waipahu, Hawaii|Waipahu]]; [[Kahului, Hawaii|Kahului]]; [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]]. [[Kihei, Hawaii|Kīhei]]; and [[Lihue, Hawaii|Līhu{{okina}}e]].

Hawaii has five counties: the [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|City and County of Honolulu]], [[Hawaii County, Hawaii|Hawaii County]], [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], [[Kauai County, Hawaii|Kauai County]], and [[Kalawao County, Hawaii|Kalawao County]].

Hawaii has the fewest local governments among U.S. states.<ref name="USCensus2010">{{cite web | url=http://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2010/compendia/statab/130ed/tables/11s0427.pdf | title=Number of Local Governments by Type | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | access-date=December 4, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208152305/http://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2010/compendia/statab/130ed/tables/11s0427.pdf | archive-date=December 8, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="USCensus2007">{{cite web | url=http://www2.census.gov/govs/cog/2007/hi.pdf | title=Hawaii | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | access-date=December 4, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202644/http://www2.census.gov/govs/cog/2007/hi.pdf | archive-date=March 4, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> Unique to this state is the lack of [[Municipal corporation|municipal governments]].

===State government===

{{See|Category:State agencies of Hawaii}}
[[File:Washington Place Honolulu HI.jpg|thumb|The [[Governor of Hawaii]] officially resides at [[Washington Place]].]]

The state government of Hawaii is modeled after the federal government with adaptations originating from the kingdom era of Hawaiian history. As codified in the [[Constitution of Hawaii]], there are three [[branches of government]]: executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch is led by the [[Governor of Hawaii]], who is assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii]], both of whom are elected on the same ticket. The governor is the only state public official elected statewide; all others are appointed by the governor. The lieutenant governor acts as the [[Secretary of State of Hawaii|Secretary of State]]. The governor and lieutenant governor oversee twenty agencies and departments from offices in the [[Hawaii State Capitol|State Capitol]]. The official residence of the governor is [[Washington Place]].

The legislative branch consists of the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Hawaii State Legislature]], which is composed of the 51-member [[Hawaii House of Representatives]] led by the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]], and the 25-member [[Hawaii Senate]] led by the [[President of the Senate]]. The Legislature meets at the State Capitol. The unified judicial branch of Hawaii is the [[Hawaii State Judiciary]]. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]], which uses [[Aliiolani Hale|Ali{{okina}}iōlani Hale]] as its chambers.

Since gaining statehood and participating in its first election in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], Hawaii has supported Democrats in all but two presidential elections; [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]] and [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], both of which were landslide reelection victories for Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] respectively. In Hawaii's statehood tenure, only Minnesota has supported Republican candidates fewer times in presidential elections.

In [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], [[John Kerry]] won the state's four electoral votes by a margin of nine percentage points with 54% of the vote. Every county supported the Democratic candidate. In 1964, [[favorite son]] candidate senator [[Hiram Fong]] of Hawaii sought the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nomination, while [[Patsy Mink]] ran in the Oregon primary in 1972.

Honolulu-born [[Barack Obama]], then serving as [[United States Senator]] from [[Illinois]], was elected the [[List of United States Presidents|44th]] President of the United States on [[2008 United States presidential election|November 4, 2008]] and was re-elected for a second term on [[2012 United States presidential election|November 6, 2012]].

===State police===

Hawaii is the only state in the United States that does not maintain a separate, state-wide police force. Instead, state law enforcement responsibilities are taken on by the municipal police agencies of the four main islands.

While Hawaii is internationally recognized as a state of the United States while also being broadly accepted as such in mainstream understanding, the [[Legal status of Hawaii|legality of this status]] has been questioned in U.S. District Court,<ref name=district/> the U.N., and other international forums.<ref name=UN-forum/> Domestically, the debate is a topic covered in the [[Kamehameha Schools]] curriculum,<ref name=curriculum/> and in classes at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalog.hawaii.edu/schoolscolleges/hawaiian/kamakakuokalani.htm|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201051929/http://www.catalog.hawaii.edu/schoolscolleges/hawaiian/kamakakuokalani.htm|archive-date=December 1, 2017|access-date=November 24, 2017|title=Kamakakuokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies}}</ref>

[[Political]] organizations seeking some form of sovereignty for Hawaii have been active since the late 19th century. Generally, their focus is on [[self-determination]] and [[self-governance]], either for Hawaii as an independent nation (in many proposals, for "Hawaiian nationals" descended from subjects of the Hawaiian Kingdom or declaring themselves as such by choice), or for people of whole or part [[native Hawaiian]] ancestry in an indigenous "''nation to nation''" relationship akin to [[tribal sovereignty]] with [[US federal recognition of Native Hawaiians]]. The pro-federal recognition [[Akaka Bill]] drew substantial opposition among Hawaiian residents in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/us/11hawaii.html|title=Hawaiians Weigh Options as Native-Status Bill Stalls|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 11, 2006|access-date=July 3, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703191002/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/us/11hawaii.html|archive-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref><ref name="HIunpo">{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/2089|title=Ka Lahui Hawaiʻi: Akaka Bill Has Plenty of Vocal Opposition|date=March 8, 2005|access-date=July 3, 2018|archive-date=September 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921094016/https://www.unpo.org/article/2089|url-status=live}}</ref> Opponents to the tribal approach argue it is not a legitimate path to Hawaiian nationhood; they also argue that the U.S. government should not be involved in re-establishing Hawaiian sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web|author=Imani Altemus-Williams|date=December 7, 2015|url=https://intercontinentalcry.org/towards-hawaiian-independence|work=IC|publisher=Center for World Indigenous Studies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703190909/https://intercontinentalcry.org/towards-hawaiian-independence|archive-date=July 3, 2018|title=Towards Hawaiian Independence: Native Americans warn Native Hawaiians of the dangers of Federal Recognition|access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Perkins">{{cite web|author=ʻUmi Perkins|date=January 16, 2015|title=Is Hawaiʻi an Occupied State?|website=The Nation|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/hawaii-occupied-state/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708074420/https://www.thenation.com/article/hawaii-occupied-state/|archive-date=July 8, 2018|access-date=July 7, 2018}}</ref>

The [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]] views the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] in 1893 as illegal, and views the subsequent [[Newlands Resolution|annexation of Hawaii by the United States]] as illegal; the movement seeks some form of greater autonomy for Hawaii, such as [[associated state|free association]] or independence from the United States.<ref name="HIunpo"/><ref name="Hawaii1893">{{cite web|url=http://hawaii-nation.org/rape.html|title=The Rape of Paradise: The Second Century Hawaiʻians Grope Toward Sovereignty As The U.S. President Apologizes|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191212/http://hawaii-nation.org/rape.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016|work=Perceptions Magazine|author=Johnny Liberty|author2=Richard Neff Hubbard|date=March–April 1996|pages=18–25|via=HAWAI`I Independent & Sovereign|access-date=October 30, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Hawaiisov">{{cite news|url=http://www.govexec.com/state-local/2014/08/hawaii-sovereignty-department-interior-hearings/91247/|title=As Feds Hold Hearings, Native Hawaiians Press Sovereignty Claims|date=August 12, 2014|publisher=Government Executive|agency=Government Executive|last1=Grass|first1=Michael|access-date=October 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007091037/http://www.govexec.com/state-local/2014/08/hawaii-sovereignty-department-interior-hearings/91247/|archive-date=October 7, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mn8TAgAAQBAJ|page=294}}|title=The United States Social Forum: Perspectives of a Movement|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2010|isbn=978-0-557-32373-9|page=294|author=United States Social Forum.

Some groups also advocate some form of redress from the United States for the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|1893 overthrow]] of [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], and for what is described as a prolonged [[military occupation]] beginning with the 1898 annexation. The [[Apology Resolution]] passed by US Congress in 1993 is cited as a major impetus by the movement for Hawaiian sovereignty.<ref name="Hawaii1893" /> The sovereignty movement considers Hawaii to be an illegally occupied nation.<ref name="Hawaiisov"/><ref>{{cite book|author=United States Social Forum.
