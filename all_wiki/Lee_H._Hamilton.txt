'''Lee Herbert Hamilton''' (born April 20, 1931) is an American politician and lawyer from [[Indiana]]. He is a former member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and a former member of the U.S. [[Homeland Security Advisory Council]]. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Hamilton represented the [[Indiana's 9th congressional district|9th congressional district]] of [[Indiana]] from 1965 to 1999. Following his departure from Congress, he has served on a number of governmental advisory boards, most notably as the vice chairman of the [[9/11 Commission]].

==Early life and education==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2018}}
Born in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], Hamilton was raised in [[Evansville, Indiana]], attending the public schools and graduating from [[Evansville Central High School]] in 1948.   An outstanding basketball player, he led the Central Bears to the state title game in March 1948; he then continued his playing career at [[DePauw University]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libraries.indiana.edu/lee-hamilton-biography|title=Lee H. Hamilton: Biography|date=November 2, 2009|website=libraries.indiana.edu}}</ref> where he played for Coach [[Jay McCreary]] before graduating in 1952 and then from the Indiana Univ. School of Law in 1956. He worked as a lawyer in private practice for the next ten years in [[Columbus, Indiana]].

==Congress==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2018}}

Bush with Lee Hamilton, left, and former Secretary of State James Baker in the Cabinet Room, Dec. 6. 2006.jpg|thumb|left|300px| Lee Hamilton (left) and [[James Baker]] (right) presented the Iraq Study Group Report to President [[George W. Bush]] on December 6, 2006.]]
Hamilton was elected to the House of Representatives as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] as part of the national Democratic landslide of 1964. He chaired many committees during his tenure in office, including the [[U.S. House Committee on International Relations|House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], the [[U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]], the [[U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Committee on Printing]], and others.

As chairman of the [[United States House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran|House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran]] (1987), Hamilton chose not to investigate President [[Ronald Reagan]] or President [[George H. W. Bush]], stating that he did not think it would be "good for the country" to put the public through another impeachment trial. Hamilton was later chair of the [[House October Surprise Task Force]] (1992).

He remained in Congress until 1999; at the time he was one of two surviving members of the large Democratic freshman class of 1965 (the other being [[John Conyers]]). He was viewed as a potential Democratic vice-presidential running mate in 1984, 1988, and 1992, due to his foreign policy credentials and Indiana's potential to turn into what would later be described as a "blue" state due to economic concerns.

==Life after Congress==
In November 2002, George W. Bush nominated Hamilton as the Vice-Chairman of the [[9/11 Commission]], officially titled The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States. On March 15, 2006, Congress announced the formation of the [[Iraq Study Group]], organized by the [[United States Institute of Peace]], of which Hamilton is the Democratic co-chairman, along with the former Secretary of State (under President George H.W. Bush) [[James A. Baker III]]. Hamilton, like Baker, is considered a master negotiator.

Since leaving Congress, Mr. Hamilton has served as a member of the Hart-Rudman Commission, and was co-chairman of the Commission to Investigate Certain Security Issues at Los Alamos. He sits on many advisory boards, including those to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the President's [[Homeland Security Advisory Council]], and the [[United States Army]]. Hamilton is an Advisory Board member and Co-Chair for the [[Partnership for a Secure America]], a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. He is previously the president and director of the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], and was appointed to serve as the vice chair of the [[9/11 Commission]]. In 2000-2001, he served as the American member of the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]], which prepared the U.N policy of [[Responsibility to Protect]], adopted in 2005. He is also a member of the Board of Advisors of [[Albright Stonebridge Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albrightstonebridge.com/team/lee-hamilton|title=About Us - Albright Stonebridge Group|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref> He was appointed Co-Chair of the [[Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future]] from 2010â€“2012 alongside [[Brent Scowcroft]].

On February 25, 2011, Hamilton wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to commute [[Jonathan Pollard]]'s sentence to time served. Pollard was serving a life sentence for providing Israel with classified information, without the intent to harm the United States, a crime which normally carries a sentence of two to four years. In his letter, he stated, "I do believe that he has served a disproportionately severe sentence." He also stated, "I have been acquainted for many years with members of his family, especially his parents, and I know how much pain and anguish they have suffered because of their son's incarceration." He concluded that, "commuting his sentence is a matter of basic compassion and justice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathanpollard.org/2011/030111.htm|title=Text: Congressman Lee Hamilton's letter to President Obama|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/nation/article/ex-rep_lee_hamilton_appeals_to_obama_for_pollard_20110302|title=Ex-Rep.
