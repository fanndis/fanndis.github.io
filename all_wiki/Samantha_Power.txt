She attended [[Lakeside High School (DeKalb County, Georgia)|Lakeside High School]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where she was a member of the cross country team and the basketball team. She subsequently received her B.A. degree from [[Yale University]], where she was a member of [[Aurelian Honor Society]], and her [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]].<ref>[https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/author/samantha-power U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations] whitehouse.gov. 2015. Retrieved December 18, 2015</ref> In 1993, at age 23, she became a U.S. citizen.

==Career==
After graduating from Yale, Power worked at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] as a researcher for Carnegie's then-President [[Morton Abramowitz]]. From 1993 to 1996, she worked as a [[war correspondent]], covering the [[Yugoslav Wars]] for ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', and ''[[The New Republic]]''. When she returned to the United States, she attended Harvard Law School, receiving her J.D. in 1999. The following year, her first edited work, ''Realizing Human Rights: Moving from Inspiration to Impact'' (edited with [[Graham Allison]]) was published. Her first book, ''[[A Problem from Hell]]: America and the Age of Genocide'', grew out of a paper she wrote while attending law school; it helped create the doctrine of "responsibility to protect."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dexter Filkins |title=The Moral Logic of Humanitarian Intervention |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/16/the-moral-logic-of-humanitarian-intervention |access-date=17 May 2020 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=9 September 2019 |quote=The book inspired a generation of activists, helping to establish the doctrine of “responsibility to protect,” which held that the United States and other wealthy countries had an obligation to defend threatened populations around the world.}}</ref>  The book won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction]] and the [[J.

Her other books include, ''Chasing the Flame: Sergio Vieira de Mello and the Fight to Save the World'' (2008), ''The Unquiet American: Richard Holbrook in the World'' (co-edited with Derek Chollet, 2011), and ''The Education of an Idealist: A Memoir'' (2019).

From 1998 to 2002, Power served as the Founding Executive Director of the [[Carr Center for Human Rights Policy]] at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Kennedy School of Government]], where she later served as the [[Anna Lindh]] Professor of Practice of Global Leadership and Public Policy.

In 2004, Power was named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world that year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/2004/time100/scientists/100power.html | work=Time | title=TIME 100: Samantha Power | date=April 19, 2003 | access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> In fall 2007, she began writing a regular column for ''Time''.

Power spent 2005–06 working in the office of U.S. Senator [[Barack Obama]] as a foreign policy fellow, where she was credited with sparking and directing Obama's interest in the [[Darfur conflict]].<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/13390609/campaign_08_the_radical_roots_of_barack_obama/4 "The Radical Roots of Barack Obama"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]''</ref> She served as a senior foreign policy adviser to [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|Obama's 2008 presidential campaign]], but resigned during the primaries. In 2009 President Obama appointed her to a position on the National Security Council and in 2013 he appointed her as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a cabinet-rank position.

==Involvement in 2008 U.S. presidential campaign==
Power was an early and outspoken supporter of [[Barack Obama]]. When she joined the Obama campaign as a foreign policy advisor, ''[[Men's Vogue]]'' described her as a "Harvard brainiac who can boast both a [[Pulitzer Prize]] and a mean [[jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]] (ask [[George Clooney]]). Now the consummate outsider is working on her inside game: D.C. politics."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensvogue.com/business/politics/feature/articles/2007/06/samantha_power|title=Samantha Power, the outsider with a jump shot, is working on her inside game: D.C. politics: Crime + Politics: mensvogue.com<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

In August 2007, Power wrote a [[Memorandum|memo]] titled "Conventional Washington versus the Change We Need", in which she provided one of the first comprehensive statements of Obama's approach to foreign policy. In the memo she comments: "Barack Obama's judgment is right; the [[conventional wisdom]] is wrong. We need a new era of tough, principled and engaged American diplomacy to deal with 21st-century challenges."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2007/08/03/campaign_memo_barack_obama_was_1.html | work=The Washington Post | access-date=July 6, 2017 | title=Campaign Memo: "Barack Obama Was Right"}}</ref>

In February and March 2008, Power began an international book tour to promote her book, ''Chasing the Flame''. Because of her involvement in the Obama campaign, many of the interviews she gave revolved around her and Barack Obama's foreign-policy views, as well as the 2008 campaign.

"Armenians for Obama" uploaded a video of Power to [[YouTube]] where she referred to Obama's "unshakeable conscientiousness" regarding genocide in general and the Armenian genocide in particular, as well as saying that he would "call a spade a spade, and speak the truth about it".<ref>{{YouTube|8yNt7XsV-Dg}}</ref>

Power appeared on [[BBC]]'s ''[[HARDtalk]]'' on March 6, stating that Barack Obama's pledge to "have all U.S. combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months"<ref>[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/iraq/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312154833/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/iraq/|date=March 12, 2008}}</ref> was a "best case scenario" that "he will revisit when he becomes president."<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/7281805.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Programmes - Hardtalk - Samantha Power|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|access-date=24 December 2014|date=March 6, 2008}}</ref> Challenged by the host as to whether this contradicted Obama's campaign commitment, she responded, "You can't make a commitment in March 2008 about what circumstances will be like in January 2009. ... He will, of course, not rely on some plan that he's crafted as a presidential candidate or a U.S. Senator. He will rely upon a plan—an operational plan—that he pulls together in consultation with people who are on the ground to whom he doesn't have daily access now, as a result of not being the president."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0308/Power_on_Obamas_Iraq_plan_best_case_scenario.html|title=Power on Obama's Iraq plan: "best case scenario"|author=Ben Smith|publisher=Politico.com|access-date=24 December 2014}}</ref> She concluded by saying that "what we can take seriously is that he will try to get U.S. forces out of Iraq as quickly and responsibly as possible."<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> In February 2009, Obama announced that the U.S. would end combat operations in Iraq by August 31, 2010 and withdraw all U.S. soldiers by the end of 2011. The U.S. formally ended its mission in Iraq on December 15 of that year.

===Resignation from the campaign===
In a March 6, 2008 interview with ''[[The Scotsman]]'', she said:

<blockquote>We fucked up in Ohio. In Ohio, they are obsessed and Hillary is going to town on it, because she knows Ohio's the only place they can win. She is a monster, too—that is off the record—she is stooping to anything ... if you are poor and she is telling you some story about how Obama is going to take your job away, maybe it will be more effective. The amount of deceit she has put forward is really unattractive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Inside-US-poll-battle-as.3854371.jp|title='Hillary Clinton's a monster': Obama aide blurts out attack in Scotsman interview|publisher=The Scotsman|access-date=24 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/03/obama-foreign-p.html|title=Obama Foreign Policy Adviser Calls Clinton a 'Monster'|publisher=ABC News}}</ref></blockquote>

Power apologized for the remarks on the night of the March 6 interview, saying that they "do not reflect my feelings about Sen. Clinton, whose leadership and public service I have long admired", and telling Irish TV reporter Michael Fisher: "Of course I regret them. I can't even believe they came out of my mouth. ... in every public appearance I've ever made talking about Senator Clinton, I have sung her praises as the leader she has been, the intellect. She's also incredibly warm, funny. ... I wish I could go back in time."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hLk1b_blPw|title=Obama advisor Samantha Power steps down|work=YouTube|access-date=24 December 2014}}</ref> The next day, in the wake of reaction to the remarks, she resigned from the Obama campaign.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-campaign8mar08,0,4538249.story]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040326232010/http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-campaign8mar08%2C0%2C4538249.story|date=March 26, 2004}}</ref> Soon afterward, ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' said that it "might have been the most ill-starred book tour since the invention of [[movable type]]."<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Protected/Articles/000/000/014/858jhkph.asp "Power Outage"], ''Weekly Standard'', March 17, 2008</ref>

Following her resignation, she also appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on March 17, 2008, saying, "can I just clarify and say, I don't think Hillary Clinton is a monster ... we have three amazing candidates left in the race." When Power later joined the State Department transition team, an official close to the transition said Power had apologized and that her "gesture to bury the hatchet" with Clinton had been well received.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Lee |title=Samantha Power Returns: Professor Who Slammed Clinton Will Be Obama Aide |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/30/samantha-power-returns-pr_n_162452.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=January 29, 2009 |access-date=January 1, 2011}}</ref> Power attended Clinton's swearing-in ceremony on February 2 and collaborated with her during her four-year tenure as Secretary of State.

In this capacity, Power kept the U.S. out of the [[Durban Review Conference]], the 2009 iteration of the UN [[World Conference against Racism]], which in 2001 was criticized for descending into "a festival of Israel bashing."<ref>{{cite news |first=Ron |last=Kampeas |title=In new White House role, Israel will still keep Susan Rice busy |url=http://www.jta.org/2013/06/05/news-opinion/politics/in-new-white-house-role-israel-will-still-keep-susan-rice-busy |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=June 5, 2013 |access-date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>

====Criticism====

Power's advocacy of [[humanitarian intervention]] has been criticized for being tendentious and militaristic, for answering a "problem from Hell" with a "solution from Hell."<ref>[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623528.2010.522053 Stephen Wertheim, "A solution from hell: the United States and the rise of humanitarian interventionism, 1991–2003,"] Journal of Genocide Research, Vol. 12, No. 3-4, 2010.</ref> Furthermore, her advocacy of deploying the United States armed forces to combat human rights abuses has been criticized as running contrary to the idea that the main purpose of the military is for national defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/05/18776098-samantha-power-white-houses-un-ambassador-nominee-has-seen-evil-at-its-worst?lite|title=Samantha Power, White House's UN ambassador nominee, has 'seen evil at its worst'|author=U.S. News|date=24 December 2014|work=NBC News|access-date=24 December 2014}}</ref> It has been argued that Power's humanitarian idealism faded after she entered the State Department and began associating, both professionally and personally, with hardline [[Realism (international relations)|realists]] like [[Henry Kissinger]].<ref name="Jilani"/>
<br>
Power has also been strongly criticized in using military intervention in Libya, Syria and Yemen that has only lead to tremendous loss of lives and furthered extremism. To quote Shireen Al-Adeimi, "These interventions, however, were anything but humanitarian: They led to a sharp increase in the loss of human lives, exacerbated a refugee crisis, enabled extremist groups, and caused an overall exacerbation of already-tenuous civil conflicts. Yet, in her recently-published memoir, The Education of an Idealist, Power downplays her role in the bloodshed that followed in Libya, and she goes as far as lamenting Obama’s inaction earlier in the Syrian Civil War. Though these interventions are certainly career-defining, they are also not the only foreign policy injustices by which Power should be remembered. The most striking thing about Power’s memoir is her complete omission of her role in what became the world’s worst humanitarian crisis: the ongoing U.S. intervention in Yemen."<ref>[https://inthesetimes.com/article/samantha-power-yemen-war-obama-administration-education-idealist Shireen Al-Adeimi, "How Dare Samantha Power Scrub the Yemen War From Her Memoir, 1991–2003,"] InTheseTimes, Sep 19, 2019. </ref>

[[File:Ambassador Samantha Power Meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin (24721851749).jpg|thumb|Power with [[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] at his office in [[Jerusalem]], February 15, 2016]]
[[Chemi Shalev]] wrote that individuals have described Power as being pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli, on the basis of statements which she made in a 2002 interview with [[Harry Kreisler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/short-decade-old-youtube-clip-likely-to-dog-power-confirmation-as-u-s-ambassador-to-un.premium-1.528003|title=YouTube clip likely to dog Samantha Power's appointment as U.S. ambassador to UN|date=5 June 2013|work=Haaretz.com|access-date=24 December 2014}}</ref> When asked what advice she would give to the president if either the Israelis or the [[Palestinians]] looked "like they might be moving towards genocide", Power said that the United States might consider the deployment of a "mammoth protection force" to monitor developments between the Israelis and Palestinians, characterizing it as a regrettable but necessary "imposition of a solution on unwilling parties" and "the lesser of evils."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} She clarified that remark on several occasions, including in an interview with ''[[Haaretz]]'' correspondent [[Shmuel Rosner]] in August 2008.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/957778.html Obama`s top adviser says does not believe in imposing a peace settlement] by Shmuel Rosner, Haaretz, August 27, 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302185201/http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/957778.html |date=March 2, 2009 }}</ref>

In July 2014, Power expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usun.state.gov/remarks/6106 |title=Remarks by Ambassador Samantha Power, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at a Security Council Briefing on the Middle East |publisher= U.S. Mission to the United Nations |date=18 July 2014}}</ref>

In December 2016, she expressed support for the Obama administration's refusal to veto [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334|a resolution]] against Israeli settlements. Power told the 15-member [[U.N. Security Council]]: "Israeli settlement activity in [[Israeli-occupied territories|territories occupied in 1967]] undermines Israel's security, harms the viability of a negotiated two-state outcome, and erodes prospects for peace and stability in the region."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/full-text-of-us-envoy-samantha-powers-speech-after-abstention-on-anti-settlement-vote/ |title=Full text of US envoy Samantha Power's speech after abstention on anti-settlement vote |date= December 24, 2016|work= The Times of Israel}}</ref>

====Tenure====
Speaking in September 2013, regarding the [[U.S. Government Assessment of the Syrian Government's Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21, 2013]], Power told a news conference that the American intelligence findings "overwhelmingly point to one stark conclusion: The [[Bashar al-Assad|Assad]] regime perpetrated an attack." She added, "The actions of the Assad regime are morally reprehensible, and they violate clearly established international norms." Power went on to criticize the failure of the United Nations structure to thwart or prosecute the atrocities committed in the Syrian conflict, which is now well into its third year. She said, "The system devised in 1945 precisely to deal with threats of this nature did not work as it was supposed to." She added, "Even in the wake of the flagrant shattering of the international norm against chemical weapons use, Russia continues to hold the council hostage and shirk its international responsibilities. "What we have learned, what the Syrian people have learned, is that the Security Council the world needs to deal with this crisis is not the Security Council we have."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gladstone|first=Rick|title=New U.S. Envoy to U.N.

"The United States calls upon Russia to pull back the military forces that are being built up in the region, to stand down, and to allow the Ukrainian people the opportunity to pursue their own government, create their own destiny and to do so freely without intimidation or fear," she said. Power declined to characterize Russian military actions when asked if they constituted aggression. She called for an independent international mediation mission to be quickly dispatched to Ukraine.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/28/us-ukraine-crisis-un-idUSBREA1R23R20140228 | work=Reuters | title=Ukraine's U.N. envoy: 'We are strong enough to defend ourselves' | date=February 28, 2014}}</ref>

In July 2014, during a forum at [[Hunter College]] commemorating the 45th anniversary of the [[Stonewall riots]], Power said that, in spite of significant progress in the US, the [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights movement]] was "far from over," noting that, "There are some parts of the world where the situation abroad is actually taking a sharp turn for the worse for LGBT individuals." She stated that [[homosexuality]] remains criminalized in nearly 80 countries, that [[Brunei]] was moving towards becoming the eighth country to enact [[capital punishment]] for same-sex sexual acts, and that Russia and [[Nigeria]] had also instituted anti-LGBT legislation in the last year. Referring to a law signed in February by Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] that imposes a life sentence upon anyone found guilty of repeated same-sex sexual acts, she said: "Unfortunately, [[Uganda]]'s anti-gay legislation is not an outlier. Nor is the climate of intolerance and abuse that it has fostered." This speech occurred on the first anniversary of [[United States v. Windsor|the U.S. Supreme Court decision]] that struck down a portion of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], and a week after the Obama administration announced travel bans against Ugandan officials responsible for anti-LGBT human rights abuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/06/27/samantha-power-lgbt-rights-struggle-far/|title=Samantha Power says LGBT rights struggle far from over|work=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|access-date=24 December 2014|date=2014-06-27}}</ref>

In March 2015, Power described defense cuts planned by [[Europe]]an countries such as Britain as "very concerning" in light of the "diffuse" challenges facing the world, such as the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic|Ebola crisis in west Africa]] and the threat from the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL). She flew to Brussels to urge European nations to abide by a [[NATO]] pledge to devote to defense at least two per cent of their national budget, and she suggested that their current spending already risked being insufficient.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11460676/Samantha-Power-defence-cuts-are-deeply-concerning.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Rosa | last=Prince | title=Samantha Power: defense cuts are 'deeply concerning' | date=March 10, 2015}}</ref>

In June 2015, Power spoke to the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee]] while negotiations were taking place with Iran regarding granting relief of sanctions on the country in return for them scaling back their nuclear program.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/16/samantha-power-snapback-sanctions-iran_n_7597762.html|title=Samantha Power Promises Snap-back Sanctions On Iran Will Not Be Blocked By Russia Or China|date=June 16, 2015|work=Huffington Post}}</ref> She told the Committee that the US would retain the ability to reinstate sanctions against Iran without unanimous support from the UN Security Council, though she said she could not provide details until a deal was finalized.<ref name=":0"/>

Power supported the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Zaidiyyah|Shia Houthis]] and forces loyal to former President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/saudi-arabia-yemen-russia-syria-foreign-policy-united-nations-blackmail-214124 |title=As the Saudis Covered Up Abuses in Yemen, America Stood By |work=[[Politico]] |date=30 July 2016}}</ref>

In 2016, while speaking on the situation in Syria, Power said, "What Russia is sponsoring and [[Aleppo offensive (September–October 2016)|doing is not counter-terrorism]], it is barbarism," "Instead of pursuing peace, Russia and Assad make war. Instead of helping get life-saving aid to civilians, Russia and Assad are bombing the humanitarian convoys, hospitals and first responders who are trying desperately to keep people alive," Power said. A [[Syrian Civil War ceasefires|September 9 ceasefire deal]] between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov aimed at putting Syria's peace process back on track effectively collapsed on Monday when an aid convoy was bombed.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-un-us-idUSKCN11V0NN | title=U.S. Slams Russian 'barbarism' in Syria, Moscow says peace almost| newspaper=Reuters| date=2016-09-25}}</ref>

Power, in her last major speech in the role, told the international community it must do everything it can to stop what she described as a Russian assault on the world order. Outlining Russian actions like the annexation of Crimea, the bombing of civilians in Syria, and a hacking of America's election, Power drew a picture of a state whose primary aim is to sow chaos and wreak havoc on the "rules-based" world order that is girded by international law and run in bodies like the United Nations. "Russia's actions are not standing up a new world order, they are tearing down the one that exists, and this is what we are fighting against," she said in a speech at the [[Atlantic Council]] on 17 January. "Having defeated the forces of fascism and communism, we now confront the forces of authoritarianism and nihilism." Those who argue, as Trump has, that undoing sanctions against Russia will make the Kremlin more amenable "have it backwards," Power said. "Easing punitive measures ... will only embolden Russia," encourage North Korea and Iran to follow them and send the message that all they need to do is "wait it out," Power argued.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/887274/un-ambassador-samantha-power-goes-out-with-a-blistering-attack-on-russia/|title=UN ambassador Samantha Power goes out with a blistering attack on Russia|first1=Max de|last1=Haldevang|first2=Max de|last2=Haldevang|website=Quartz}}</ref>
