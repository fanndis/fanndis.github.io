The '''European debt crisis''' (often also referred to as the '''eurozone crisis''' or the '''European sovereign debt crisis''') is a multi-year [[debt crisis]] that has been taking place in the [[European Union]] since the end of 2009. Several [[eurozone]] member states ([[Greece]], [[Portugal]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Spain]] and [[Cyprus]]) were unable to repay or refinance their [[government debt]] or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other [[eurozone countries]], the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), or the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).

The eurozone crisis was caused by a [[Currency crisis|balance-of-payments crisis]] (a sudden stop of foreign capital into countries that had substantial deficits and were dependent on foreign lending). The crisis was worsened by the inability of states to resort to [[devaluation]] (reductions in the value of the national currency).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Debt accumulation in some eurozone members was in part due to macroeconomic differences among eurozone member states prior to the adoption of the euro. The European Central Bank adopted an interest rate that incentivized investors in Northern eurozone members to lend to the South, whereas the South was incentivized to borrow (because interest rates were very low). Over time, this led to the accumulation of deficits in the South, primarily by private economic actors.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> A lack of fiscal policy coordination among eurozone member states contributed to imbalanced capital flows in the eurozone.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> A lack of financial regulatory centralization or harmonization among eurozone states, coupled with a lack of credible commitments to provide bailouts to banks, incentivized risky financial transactions by banks.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> The detailed causes of the crisis varied from country to country. In several countries, private debts arising from a property [[Economic bubble|bubble]] were transferred to sovereign debt as a result of banking system [[bailout]]s and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.<ref name="Seth W.

The onset of crisis was in late 2009 when the Greek government disclosed that its budget deficits were far higher than previously thought.<ref name=":0" /> Greece called for external help in early 2010, receiving an EU-IMF bailout package in May 2010.<ref name=":0" /> European nations implemented a series of financial support measures such as the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF) in early 2010 and the [[European Stability Mechanism]] (ESM) in late 2010. The ECB also contributed to solve the crisis by lowering [[interest rates]] and providing cheap loans of more than one trillion euro in order to maintain money flows between European banks. On 6 September 2012, the ECB calmed financial markets by announcing free unlimited support for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout/precautionary programme from EFSF/ESM, through some yield lowering [[Outright Monetary Transactions]] (OMT).<ref name="ecb">[http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2012/html/pr120906_1.en.html "Technical features of Outright Monetary Transactions"], [[European Central Bank|ECB]] Press Release, 6 September 2012</ref> Ireland and Portugal received EU-IMF bailouts In November 2010 and May 2011, respectively.<ref name=":0" /> In March 2012, Greece received its second bailout. Both Spain and Cyprus received rescue packages in June 2012.<ref name=":0" />

Return to economic growth and improved structural deficits enabled Ireland and Portugal to exit their bailout programmes in July 2014. Greece and Cyprus both managed to partly regain market access in 2014. Spain never officially received a bailout programme. Its rescue package from the ESM was earmarked for a bank recapitalisation fund and did not include financial support for the government itself.

The crisis has had significant adverse economic effects and labour market effects, with unemployment rates in Greece and Spain reaching 27%,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57591731/eurozone-unemployment-at-record-high-in-may/ |title=Eurozone unemployment at record high in May |work=CBS News |date=1 July 2013 |access-date=6 July 2013}}</ref> and was blamed for subdued economic growth, not only for the entire eurozone, but for the entire European Union. As such, it can be argued to have had a major political impact on the ruling governments in 10 out of 19 eurozone countries, contributing to power shifts in Greece, Ireland, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, Slovakia, Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as outside of the eurozone, in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chiara Casi |title=Bail in -la gestione delle crisi bancarie |url=https://www.academia.edu/40537955 |journal=Bail in e la Nuova Gestione delle Crisi Bancarie |access-date=6 October 2019}}</ref>

The eurozone crisis resulted from the structural problem of the eurozone and a combination of complex factors. There is a consensus that the root of the eurozone crisis lay in a [[Currency crisis|balance-of-payments crisis]] (a sudden stop of foreign capital into countries that were dependent on foreign lending), and that this crisis was worsened by the fact that states could not resort to [[devaluation]] (reductions in the value of the national currency to make exports more competitive in foreign markets).<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Copelovitch|first1=Mark|last2=Frieden|first2=Jeffry|last3=Walter|first3=Stefanie|date=14 March 2016|title=The Political Economy of the Euro Crisis|journal=Comparative Political Studies|language=en-US|volume=49|issue=7|pages=811–840|doi=10.1177/0010414016633227|s2cid=18181290|issn=0010-4140|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:33694190}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Frieden|first1=Jeffry|last2=Walter|first2=Stefanie|date=11 May 2017|title=Understanding the Political Economy of the Eurozone Crisis|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=20|issue=1|pages=371–390|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-023101|s2cid=15431111|issn=1094-2939|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:33459439}}</ref> Other important factors include the [[Financialization|globalisation of finance]]; easy credit conditions during the 2002–2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]; international trade imbalances; [[real estate bubble]]s that have since burst; the [[Great Recession]] of 2008–2012; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by states to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses.

Macroeconomic divergence among eurozone member states led to imbalanced capital flows between the member states. Prior to the adoption of the euro, Southern eurozone member states grew rapidly (with rising wages and prices) whereas Northern eurozone members grew slowly. Despite these different macroeconomic conditions, the European Central Bank could only adopt one interest rate, choosing one that meant that real interest rates in Germany were high (relative to inflation) and low in Southern eurozone member states. This incentivized investors in Germany to lend to the South, whereas the South was incentivized to borrow (because interest rates were very low). Over time, this led to the accumulation of deficits in the South, primarily by private economic actors.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> 

Eurozone member states could have alleviated the imbalances in capital flows and debt accumulation in the South by coordinating national fiscal policies. Germany could have adopted more expansionary fiscal policies (to boost domestic demand and reduce the outflow of capital) and Southern eurozone member states could have adopted more restrictive fiscal policies (to curtail domestic demand and reduce borrowing from the North).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />  Per the requirements of the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]], governments pledged to limit their [[deficit spending]] and debt levels. However, some of the signatories, including Germany and France, failed to stay within the confines of the [[Maastricht criteria]] and turned to [[Securitization|securitising]] future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards.<ref name="euromoney.com">"[http://www.euromoney.com/Article/1000384/How-Europes-governments-have-enronized-their-debts.html How Europe's Governments have Enronized their debts]," Mark Brown and Alex Chambers, Euromoney, September 2005</ref> This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures.<ref name="euromoney.com" /> From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, [[PASOK]] government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of [[sovereign default]]s in certain [[European State|European states]] developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.<ref>Paul Belkin, Martin A. Weiss, Rebecca M. Nelson and Darek E. Mix "The Eurozone Crisis: Overview and Issues For Congress", Congressional Research Service Report R42377, 29 February 2012.</ref> The under-reporting was exposed through a revision of the forecast for the 2009 budget deficit from "6–8%" of [[GDP]] (no greater than 3% of GDP was a rule of the [[Maastricht Treaty]]) to 12.7%, almost immediately after PASOK won the [[2009 Greek legislative election|October 2009 Greek national elections]]. Large upwards revision of budget deficit forecasts due to the international financial crisis were not limited to Greece: for example, in the United States forecast for the 2009 budget deficit was raised [[2009 United States federal budget#Deficit|from $407 billion projected in the 2009 fiscal year budget, to $1.4 trillion]], while in the United Kingdom there was a final forecast more than 4 times higher than the original.<ref>{{cite news |title=Budget 2009 in figures |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8002618.stm |work=BBC News |date=22 April 2009 |access-date=6 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="Media Coverage">{{cite news |url=https://www.academia.edu/6655991|title= Media Coverage of the 2010 Greek Debt Crisis: Inaccuracies and Evidence of Manipulation |work= Academia.edu|date=January 2014 }}</ref> In Greece, the low ("6–8%") forecast was reported until very late in the year (September 2009), clearly not corresponding to the actual situation.

Fragmented [[financial regulation]] contributed to irresponsible lending in the years prior to the crisis. In the eurozone, each country had its own financial regulations, which allowed financial institutions to exploit gaps in monitoring and regulatory responsibility to resort to loans that were high-yield but very risky. Harmonization or centralization in financial regulations could have alleviated the problem of risky loans. Another factor that incentivized risky financial transaction was that national governments could not credibly commit not to bailout financial institutions who had undertaken risky loans, thus causing a [[moral hazard]] problem.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

The European debt crisis erupted in the wake of the [[Great Recession]] around late 2009, and was characterized by an environment of overly high government [[structural deficits]] and accelerating debt levels. When, as a negative repercussion of the Great Recession, the relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large capital losses, most states in Europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans, because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy. As of January 2009, a group of 10 central and eastern European banks had already asked for a [[bailout]].<ref name=raiff>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9830fa0c-e809-11dd-b2a5-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz2u0Q66WnT |title=FT: "Banks ask for crisis funds for eastern Europe" 22 Jan 2009 |work=Financial Times |access-date=14 October 2014}}</ref> At the time, the [[European Commission]] released a forecast of a 1.8% decline in EU economic output for 2009, making the outlook for the banks even worse.<ref name=raiff/><ref name="The Euro's Three Crises">{{cite journal |title=The Euro's Three Crises |journal=Jay C.

In the first few weeks of 2010, there was renewed anxiety about excessive national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and [[current account deficit]]s. This in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or [[refinance]] existing [[government debt]], particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, as in the case of Greece and Portugal.

The states that were adversely affected by the crisis faced a strong rise in interest rate spreads for government bonds as a result of investor concerns about their future debt sustainability. Four eurozone states had to be rescued by sovereign bailout programs, which were provided jointly by the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[European Commission]], with additional support at the technical level from the [[European Central Bank]]. Together these three international organisations representing the bailout creditors became nicknamed "the [[European Troika|Troika]]".

To fight the crisis some governments have focused on raising taxes and lowering expenditures, which contributed to social unrest and significant debate among economists, many of whom advocate greater deficits when economies are struggling. Especially in countries where budget deficits and sovereign debts have increased sharply, a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of bond [[yield spread]]s and risk insurance on CDS between these countries and other [[EU member states]], most importantly Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7d25573c-1ccc-11df-8d8e-00144feab49a.html |title=Gilt yields rise amid UK debt concerns |last1=Oakley |first1=David |last2=Hope |first2=Kevin |work=Financial Times |date=18 February 2010 |access-date=15 April 2011}}</ref> By the end of 2011, Germany was estimated to have made more than {{Nowrap|€9 billion}} out of the crisis as investors flocked to safer but near zero interest rate German federal government bonds (''bunds'').<ref name="euo_09112011">{{cite news |url=http://euobserver.com/19/114231 |title=Germany estimated to have made €9 billion profit out of crisis |author=Valentina Pop |date=9 November 2011 |newspaper=[[EUobserver]] |access-date=8 December 2011}}</ref> By July 2012 also the Netherlands, Austria, and Finland benefited from zero or negative interest rates.

In September 2011 the [[Swiss National Bank]] surprised currency traders by pledging that "it will no longer tolerate a euro-franc exchange rate below the minimum rate of 1.20 francs", effectively weakening the Swiss franc. This is the biggest Swiss intervention since 1978.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-06/swiss-national-bank-sets-minimum-exchange-rate-of-1-20-against-the-euro.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018121531/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-06/swiss-national-bank-sets-minimum-exchange-rate-of-1-20-against-the-euro.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 October 2011 |title=Swiss Pledge Unlimited Currency Purchases |newspaper=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=6 September 2011 |access-date=6 September 2011}}</ref>

In total, the debt crisis forced five out of 17 eurozone countries to seek help from other nations by the end of 2012.

In mid-2012, due to successful fiscal consolidation and implementation of structural reforms in the countries being most at risk and various policy measures taken by EU leaders and the ECB (see below), financial stability in the eurozone has improved significantly and interest rates have steadily fallen. This has also greatly diminished contagion risk for other eurozone countries. {{As of|2012|10}} only 3 out of 17 eurozone countries, namely Greece, Portugal, and Cyprus still battled with long-term interest rates above 6%.<ref name="ECB-interest-rates">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.int/stats/money/long/html/index.en.html |title=Long-term interest rate statistics for EU Member States |publisher=ECB |date=13 November 2012 |access-date=13 November 2012}}</ref> By early January 2013, successful sovereign debt auctions across the eurozone but most importantly in Ireland, Spain, and Portugal, shows investors believe the ECB-backstop has worked.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578259942900715134 |title=Euro-Zone Bonds Find Favor |author=Richard Barley |date=24 January 2013 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> In November 2013 ECB lowered its [[bank rate]] to only 0.25% to aid recovery in the eurozone.<ref name="ecb-25">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24851483 |title=ECB cuts interest rates to record low |date=7 November 2013 |work=BBC News |access-date=7 November 2013}}</ref> As of May 2014 only two countries (Greece and Cyprus) still need help from third parties.<ref name=portugal>{{cite news |url=http://derstandard.at/2000001319627/Portugal-kehrt-ohne-Sicherheitsnetz-an-Finanzmaerkte-zurueck |title=Portugal kehrt ohne Sicherheitsnetz an Finanzmärkte zurück |date=18 May 2014 |work=DerStandard |access-date=18 May 2014}}</ref>

The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly.

The Greek crisis was triggered by the turmoil of the [[Great Recession]], which lead the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10% of GDP.<ref name="Debt Past"/> In the case of Greece, the high budget deficit (which, after several corrections, was revealed that it had been allowed to reach 10.2%  and 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively<ref name="Deficit Eurostat">{{cite news |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=teina200|title= Eurostat (budget deficit data)|work= Eurostat |access-date=2 September 2020}}</ref>) was coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio (which, until then, was relatively stable for several years, at just above 100% of GDP- as calculated after all corrections).<ref name="Debt Past"/> Thus, the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio, which already reached 127% of GDP in 2009.<ref name="Debt 2009 2017 Eurostat">{{cite news |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&plugin=1&pcode=teina225&language=en|title= Eurostat (Government debt data)|work= Eurostat |access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref> In contrast, Italy was able (despite the crisis) to keep its 2009 budget deficit at 5.1% of GDP,<ref name="Deficit Eurostat"/> which was crucial, given that it had a public debt to GDP ratio comparable to Greece's.<ref name="Debt 2009 2017 Eurostat"/> 
In addition, being a member of the Eurozone, Greece had essentially no autonomous [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union#Monetary policy inflexibility|monetary policy flexibility]].<ref name="Euro effect 1"/><ref name="Euro effect 2"/>

Finally, there was an effect of controversies about Greek statistics (due the aforementioned drastic budget deficit revisions which led to an increase in the calculated value of the Greek public debt by [[Greek financial audits, 2009–10|about 10%]], a public debt to GDP ratio of about 100% until 2007), while there have been arguments about a possible effect of [[#Criticism of the role of news media and stereotyping|media reports]]. Consequently, Greece was "punished" by the markets which increased borrowing rates, making it impossible for the country to finance its debt since early 2010.

Despite the drastic upwards revision of the forecast for the 2009 budget deficit in October 2009, Greek borrowing rates initially rose rather slowly. By April 2010 it was apparent that the country was becoming unable to borrow from the markets; on 23 April 2010, the Greek government requested an initial loan of {{Nowrap|€45 billion}} from the EU and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), to cover its financial needs for the remaining part of 2010.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Greek Bailout Talks Could Take Three Weeks as Bond Repayment Looms in May |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-20/greek-talks-on-61-billion-aid-may-take-three-weeks-as-bond-payment-looms.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202181605/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-20/greek-talks-on-61-billion-aid-may-take-three-weeks-as-bond-payment-looms.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 February 2014 |date=20 April 2010 |last1=Ziotis |first1=Christos |last2=Weeks |first2=Natalie}}</ref> A few days later [[Standard & Poor's]] slashed Greece's sovereign debt rating to BB+ or "[[high-yield debt|junk]]" status amid fears of [[Default (finance)|default]],<ref name=nyt04282010>{{cite news |title=Cuts to Debt Rating Stir Anxiety in Europe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/business/global/28drachma.html |work=The New York Times |first1=Jack |last1=Ewing |first2=Jack |last2=Healy |date=27 April 2010 |access-date=6 May 2010}}</ref> in which case investors were liable to lose 30–50% of their money.<ref name=nyt04282010/> [[Stock market]]s worldwide and the euro currency declined in response to the downgrade.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8647441.stm |title=Greek bonds rated 'junk' by Standard & Poor's |work=BBC News |date=27 April 2010 |access-date=6 May 2010}}</ref>

During the second half of 2014, the Greek government again negotiated with the Troika. The negotiations were this time about how to comply with the programme requirements, to ensure activation of the payment of its last scheduled eurozone bailout tranche in December 2014, and about a potential update of its remaining bailout programme for 2015–16. When calculating the impact of the 2015 fiscal budget presented by the Greek government, there was a disagreement, with the calculations of the Greek government showing it fully complied with the goals of its agreed ''"Midterm fiscal plan 2013–16"'', while the Troika calculations were less optimistic and returned a not covered financing gap at €2.5bn (being required to be covered by additional austerity measures). As the Greek government insisted their calculations were more accurate than those presented by the Troika, they submitted an unchanged fiscal budget bill on 21 November, to be voted for by the parliament on 7 December. The [[Eurogroup]] was scheduled to meet and discuss the updated review of the Greek bailout programme on 8 December (to be published on the same day), and the potential adjustments to the remaining programme for 2015–16. There were rumours in the press that the Greek government has proposed immediately to end the previously agreed and continuing IMF bailout programme for 2015–16, replacing it with the transfer of €11bn unused bank recapitalization funds currently held as reserve by the [[Hellenic Financial Stability Fund]] (HFSF), along with establishment of a new precautionary Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL) issued by the [[European Stability Mechanism]]. The ECCL instrument is often used as a follow-up precautionary measure, when a state has exited its sovereign bailout programme, with transfers only taking place if adverse financial/economic circumstances materialize, but with the positive effect that it help calm down financial markets as the presence of this extra backup guarantee mechanism makes the environment safer for investors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_16/11/2014_544644 |title=Analysis: Markets keep government in check |newspaper=Kathimerini |date=16 November 2014}}</ref>

The rising political uncertainty of what would follow caused the Troika to suspend all scheduled remaining aid to Greece under its second programme, until such time as the Greek government either accepted the previously negotiated conditional payment terms or alternatively could reach a mutually accepted agreement of some new updated terms with its public creditors.<ref name="Bailout suspended until formation of a new-elect government">{{cite news |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_29/12/2014_545787 |title=IMF suspends aid to Greece ahead of new elections |newspaper=Kathimerini |date=29 December 2014}}</ref> This rift caused a renewed increasingly growing liquidity crisis (both for the Greek government and Greek financial system), resulting in plummeting stock prices at the [[Athens Stock Exchange]] while interest rates for the Greek government at the private lending market spiked to levels once again making it inaccessible as an alternative funding source.

Faced by the threat of a sovereign default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its second programme. In the process, the Eurogroup granted a six-month technical extension of its second bailout programme to Greece.

On 5 July 2015, the citizens of Greece voted decisively (a 61% to 39% decision with 62.5% voter turnout) to reject a referendum that would have given Greece more bailout help from other EU members in return for increased austerity measures. As a result of this vote, Greece's finance minister [[Yanis Varoufakis]] stepped down on 6 July.

The Irish sovereign debt crisis arose not from government over-spending, but from the state guaranteeing the six main Irish-based banks who had financed a [[property bubble]]. On 29 September 2008, Finance Minister [[Brian Lenihan Jnr]] issued a two-year guarantee to the banks' depositors and bondholders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/remember-how-ireland-was-ruined-by-bankers-2538092.html |title=Remember how Ireland was ruined by bankers |publisher=Independent News & Media PLC |last=McConnell |first=Daniel |date=13 February 2011 |access-date=6 June 2012}}</ref> The guarantees were subsequently renewed for new deposits and bonds in a slightly different manner. In 2009, a [[National Asset Management Agency]] (NAMA) was created to acquire large property-related loans from the six banks at a market-related "long-term economic value".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/obituary-brian-lenihan-td-1959-2011-153136-Jun2011/ |title=Brian Lenihan, Jr, Obituary and Info |publisher=The Journal |access-date=30 June 2012}}</ref>

Irish banks had lost an estimated 100 billion euros, much of it related to defaulted loans to property developers and homeowners made in the midst of the property bubble, which burst around 2007. The economy collapsed during 2008. Unemployment rose from 4% in 2006 to 14% by 2010, while the national budget went from a surplus in 2007 to a deficit of 32% GDP in 2010, the highest in the history of the eurozone, despite austerity measures.<ref name="Lewis 2011">{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Michael |year=2011 |title=Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-08181-7|title-link=Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ei.html |title=CIA World Factbook-Ireland-Retrieved 2 December 2011 |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] |access-date=14 May 2012}}</ref>

With Ireland's credit rating falling rapidly in the face of mounting estimates of the banking losses, guaranteed depositors and bondholders cashed in during 2009–10, and especially after August 2010. (The necessary funds were borrowed from the central bank.)

Portugal's debt was in September 2012 forecast by the Troika to peak at around 124% of GDP in 2014, followed by a firm downward trajectory after 2014. Previously the Troika had predicted it would peak at 118.5% of GDP in 2013, so the developments proved to be a bit worse than first anticipated, but the situation was described as fully sustainable and progressing well. As a result, from the slightly worse economic circumstances, the country has been given one more year to reduce the budget deficit to a level below 3% of GDP, moving the target year from 2013 to 2014. The budget deficit for 2012 has been forecast to end at 5%. The recession in the economy is now also projected to last until 2013, with GDP declining 3% in 2012 and 1% in 2013; followed by a return to positive real growth in 2014.<ref name="October 2012 status">{{cite web |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_03/10/2012_464362 |title=Portugal seeks market access with $5 bln bond exchange |publisher=Kathimerini (English Edition) |date=3 October 2012 |access-date=17 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005235156/http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_03/10/2012_464362 |archive-date=5 October 2012 }}</ref> Unemployment rate increased to over 17% by end of 2012 but it has since decreased gradually to 10,5% as of November 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-datasets/-/UNE_RT_M |title=Unemployment by sex and age - monthly average |publisher=Eurostat |date=December 2016 |access-date=9 January 2017}}</ref>

Once Portugal regains complete market access, measured as the moment it successfully manage to sell a bond series with a full 10-year maturity, it is expected to benefit from interventions by the ECB, which announced readiness to implement extended support in the form of some yield-lowering bond purchases ([[Outright Monetary Transactions|OMTs]]),<ref name="October 2012 status"/> aiming to bring governmental interest rates down to sustainable levels.

====European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)====
{{main|European Financial Stability Facility}}
On 9 May 2010, the 27 EU member states agreed to create the European Financial Stability Facility, a legal instrument<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/30293] The EFSF, "a legal instrument agreed by finance ministers earlier this month following the risk of Greece's debt crisis spreading to other weak economies".</ref> aiming at preserving financial stability in Europe, by providing financial assistance to eurozone states in difficulty. The EFSF can issue bonds or other debt instruments on the market with the support of the German Debt Management Office to raise the funds needed to provide loans to eurozone countries in financial troubles, recapitalise banks or buy sovereign debt.<ref>{{cite news |last=Thesing |first=Gabi |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-22/ecb-s-stark-says-rescue-fund-may-buy-bonds-recapitalize-banks.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124054857/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-22/ecb-s-stark-says-rescue-fund-may-buy-bonds-recapitalize-banks.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 January 2011 |title=European Rescue Fund May Buy Bonds, Recapitalize Banks, ECB's Stark Says |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |date=22 January 2011 |access-date=16 May 2012 }}</ref>

Emissions of bonds are backed by guarantees given by the euro area member states in proportion to their share in the paid-up capital of the [[European Central Bank]]. The €440 billion lending capacity of the facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by the eurozone countries' governments and may be combined with loans up to €60 billion from the [[European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism]] (reliant on funds raised by the [[European Commission]] using the EU budget as collateral) and up to €250 billion from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) to obtain a financial safety net up to €750 billion.<ref>[http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2010/06/spain-seeks-to-reassure-eu-leaders/68293.aspx Europeanvoice.com] "Media reports said that Spain would ask for support from two EU funds for eurozone governments in financial difficulty: a €60bn ‘European financial stabilisation mechanism', which is reliant on guarantees from the EU budget".</ref>

The EFSF issued €5 billion of five-year bonds in its inaugural benchmark issue 25 January 2011, attracting an order book of €44.5 billion. This amount is a record for any sovereign bond in Europe, and €24.5 billion more than the [[European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism]] (EFSM), a separate European Union funding vehicle, with a €5 billion issue in the first week of January 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/2755784/EFSF-inaugural-bond-meets-record-demand.html |author=Hamish Risk |title=International banking finance and capital markets news and analysis |publisher=Euromoney.com |date=25 January 2011 |access-date=16 May 2012}}</ref>

On 29 November 2011, the member state finance ministers agreed to expand the EFSF by creating certificates that could guarantee up to 30% of new issues from troubled euro-area governments, and to create investment vehicles that would boost the EFSF's firepower to intervene in primary and secondary bond markets.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/29/eurozone-efsf-statement-idUSB5E7MG02H20111129 |title=TEXT-Euro zone finance ministers approve extending EFSF capacity |date=29 November 2011 |work=Reuters |location=UK |access-date=10 May 2010}}</ref>

The transfers of bailout funds were performed in tranches over several years and were conditional on the governments simultaneously implementing a package of [[fiscal austerity|fiscal consolidation]], structural reforms, privatization of public assets and setting up funds for further bank recapitalization and resolution.

====Brussels agreement and aftermath====
On 26 October 2011, leaders of the 17 eurozone countries met in Brussels and agreed on a 50% write-off of Greek sovereign debt held by banks, a fourfold increase (to about €1 trillion) in bail-out funds held under the [[European Financial Stability Facility]], an increased mandatory level of 9% for bank capitalisation within the EU and a set of commitments from Italy to take measures to reduce its national debt. Also pledged was {{Nowrap|€35 billion}} in "credit enhancement" to mitigate losses likely to be suffered by European banks. José Manuel Barroso characterised the package as a set of "exceptional measures for exceptional times".<ref name=BBCleaders>{{cite news |title=Leaders agree eurozone debt deal after late-night talks |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15472547 |access-date=27 October 2011 |newspaper=BBC News |date=27 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Bhatti |first=Jabeen |title=EU leaders reach a deal to tackle debt crisis |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/story/2011-10-25/euro-summit/50919216/1?csp=34news |access-date=27 October 2011 |newspaper=USA Today |date=27 October 2011}}</ref>

The package's acceptance was put into doubt on 31 October when Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou announced that a [[2012 Greek economy referendum|referendum]] would be held so that the Greek people would have the final say on the bailout, upsetting financial markets.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15533940 |title=Greece debt crisis: Markets dive on Greek referendum |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 November 2011 |access-date=16 May 2012}}</ref> On 3 November 2011 the promised Greek referendum on the bailout package was withdrawn by Prime Minister Papandreou.

In late 2011, Landon Thomas in the ''New York Times'' noted that some, at least, European banks were maintaining high dividend payout rates and none were getting capital injections from their governments even while being required to improve capital ratios. Thomas quoted [[Richard Koo]], an economist based in Japan, an expert on that country's banking crisis, and specialist in [[recession#Balance sheet recession|balance sheet recessions]], as saying:
<blockquote>I do not think Europeans understand the implications of a systemic banking crisis.&nbsp;... When all banks are forced to raise capital at the same time, the result is going to be even weaker banks and an even longer recession—if not depression.&nbsp;... Government intervention should be the first resort, not the last resort.</blockquote>
Beyond [[share capital|equity issuance]] and [[sub-sovereign bonds|debt-to-equity]] conversion, then, one analyst "said that as banks find it more difficult to raise funds, they will move faster to cut down on loans and unload lagging assets" as they work to improve capital ratios. This latter contraction of balance sheets "could lead to a depression", the analyst said.<ref>Thomas, Landon, Jr., [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/business/global/european-banks-retrench-while-keeping-up-appearances.html "Banks Retrench in Europe While Keeping Up Appearances" (limited no-charge access)], ''The New York Times'', 22 December 2011.

;Final agreement on the second bailout package
In a marathon meeting on 20/21 February 2012 the Eurogroup agreed with the IMF and the [[Institute of International Finance]] on the final conditions of the second bailout package worth €130 billion. The lenders agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering of the interest rates of the Greek Loan Facility to a level of just 150 [[basis points]] above [[Euribor]]. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117%<ref name="sueddeutsche.de"/> and 120.5% of GDP by 2020.<ref name="second-bailout-agreement"/>

On 30 November 2011, the ECB, the US [[Federal Reserve]], the [[central bank]]s of [[Bank of Canada|Canada]], [[Bank of Japan|Japan]], [[Bank of England|Britain]] and the [[Swiss National Bank]] provided global financial markets with additional liquidity to ward off the debt crisis and to support the [[real economy]]. The central banks agreed to lower the cost of dollar [[currency swap]]s by 50 basis points to come into effect on 5 December 2011. They also agreed to provide each other with abundant liquidity to make sure that commercial banks stay liquid in other currencies.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzz.ch/finanzen/nachrichten/grosse_notenbanken_fluten_globale_finanzmaerkte_mit_geld_1.13468265.html |title=Grosse Notenbanken versorgen Banken mit Liquidität&nbsp;– Kursfeuerwerk an den Börsen&nbsp;– auch SNB beteiligt |newspaper=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung|NZZ Online]] |date=23 November 2010 |access-date=14 May 2012}}</ref>

With the aim of boosting the recovery in the eurozone economy by lowering interest rates for businesses, the ECB cut its [[bank rate]]s in multiple steps in 2012–2013, reaching an historic low of 0.25% in November 2013. The lowered borrowing rates have also caused the euro to fall in relation to other currencies, which is hoped will boost exports from the eurozone and further aid the recovery.<ref name="ecb-25"/>

With inflation falling to 0.5% in May 2014, the ECB again took measures to stimulate the eurozone economy, which grew at just 0.2% during the first quarter of 2014.<ref name=imposes />  (Deflation or very low inflation encourages holding cash, causing a decrease in purchases.)  On 5 June, the central bank cut the prime interest rate to 0.15%, and set the deposit rate at −0.10%.<ref name=newground>{{cite news |title=European Central Bank Breaks New Ground to Press Growth |date=5 June 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/business/international/european-central-bank-cuts-interest-rate.html |access-date=5 June 2014 |work=New York Times |author=Jack Ewing |author2=Neil Irwin}}</ref>  The latter move in particular was seen as "a bold and unusual move", as a negative interest rate had never been tried on a wide-scale before.<ref name=imposes>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27717594 |access-date=5 June 2014 |title=ECB imposes negative interest rate |publisher=BBC |date=5 June 2014}}</ref>  Additionally, the ECB announced it would offer long-term four-year loans at the cheap rate (normally the rate is primarily for overnight lending), but only if the borrowing banks met strict conditions designed to ensure the funds ended up in the hands of businesses instead of, for example, being used to buy low risk government bonds.<ref name=imposes />  Collectively, the moves are aimed at avoiding [[deflation]], devaluing the euro to make exportation more viable, and at increasing "real world" lending.<ref name=imposes /><ref name=newground />

Stock markets reacted strongly to the ECB rate cuts. The German [[DAX]] index, for example, set a record high the day the new rates were announced.<ref name=newground />  Meanwhile, the euro briefly fell to a four-month low against the dollar.<ref name=imposes />  However, due to the unprecedented nature of the negative interest rate, the long-term effects of the stimulus measures are hard to predict.<ref name=newground />  Bank president [[Mario Draghi]] signalled the central bank was willing to do whatever it takes to turn around the eurozone economies, remarking "Are we finished?

;Resignations
In September 2011, [[Jürgen Stark]] became the second German after [[Axel A. Weber]] to resign from the ECB Governing Council in 2011. Weber, the former [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] president, was once thought to be a likely successor to [[Jean-Claude Trichet]] as bank president. He and Stark were both thought to have resigned due to "unhappiness with the [[European Central Bank#Bond purchase|ECB's bond purchases]], which critics say erode the bank's independence".
Stark was "probably the most hawkish" member of the council when he resigned. Weber was replaced by his Bundesbank successor [[Jens Weidmann]], while Belgium's [[Peter Praet]] took Stark's original position, heading the ECB's economics department.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/belgiums-praet-to-serve-as-ecbs-chief-economist-2012-01-03 |title=Belgium's Praet to serve as ECB's chief economist |website=[[MarketWatch]] |date=3 January 2012 |access-date=12 February 2012}}</ref>

This way the ECB tried to make sure that banks have enough cash to pay off {{Nowrap|€200 billion}}their own maturing debts in the first three months of 2012, and at the same time keep operating and loaning to businesses so that a credit crunch does not choke off economic growth.

;Reorganization of the European banking system
On 16 June 2012 the European Central Bank together with other European leaders hammered out plans for the ECB to become a bank regulator and to form a deposit insurance program to augment national programs. Other economic reforms promoting European growth and employment were also proposed.<ref name="NYTECB6/16">{{cite news |title=European Leaders to Present Plan to Quell the Crisis Quickly |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/world/europe/european-leaders-present-plan-to-quell-euro-zone-crisis.html |access-date=16 June 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=16 June 2012 |author=Jack Ewing}}</ref>

;Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs)
On 6 September 2012, the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] announced to offer additional financial support in the form of some yield-lowering bond purchases ([[Outright Monetary Transactions|OMT]]), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from [[European Financial Stability Facility|EFSF]]/[[European Stability Mechanism|ESM]].<ref name="ecb" /> A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MoU) agreement.<ref name="ecb"/><ref name="NYT20120907" /> Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement.<ref name="ecb"/><ref name="http"/> Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence in the very near future helped to calm the markets).

Such a mechanism serves as a "financial firewall". Instead of a default by one country rippling through the entire interconnected financial system, the firewall mechanism can ensure that downstream nations and banking systems are protected by guaranteeing some or all of their obligations. Then the single default can be managed while limiting [[financial contagion]].

On 28 June 2012 eurozone leaders agreed to permit loans by the European Stability Mechanism to be made directly to stressed banks rather than through eurozone states, to avoid adding to sovereign debt.

Instead of public austerity, a "growth compact" centring on tax increases<ref name="Kapoor-Bofinger"/> and deficit spending is proposed. Since struggling European countries lack the funds to engage in [[deficit spending]], German economist and member of the [[German Council of Economic Experts]] [[Peter Bofinger]] and Sony Kapoor of the global [[think tank]] Re-Define suggest providing {{Nowrap|€40 billion}} in additional funds to the [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB), which could then lend ten times that amount to the employment-intensive smaller business sector.<ref name="Kapoor-Bofinger"/> The EU is currently planning a possible {{Nowrap|€10 billion}} increase in the EIB's capital base. Furthermore, the two suggest financing additional public investments by growth-friendly taxes on "property, land, wealth, carbon emissions and the under-taxed financial sector". They also called on EU countries to renegotiate the [[Offshore bank#European Savings Tax Directive|EU savings tax directive]] and to sign an agreement to help each other crack down on tax evasion and avoidance.

In the turmoil of the [[2007–2012 global economic crisis|Global Financial Crisis]], the focus across all [[EU member states]] has been gradually to implement [[austerity]] measures, with the purpose of lowering the [[budget deficits]] to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the debt level would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the [[Stability and Growth Pact]]. To further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the [[Euro Plus Pact]], consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the [[European Fiscal Compact|Fiscal Compact]] which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a [[balanced budget amendment]] as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national law/constitution, but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a [[structural deficit]] of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the debt level).<ref name="fiscal_union"/><ref name="20111202Guardian"/> Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and [[internal devaluation]], i.e. lowering their relative [[production costs]].<ref name="krugman-2011-10-22"/> The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states.<ref name="google-current-account-linechart">{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=bca_ngdpd&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=world&idim=country:GR:PT:ES:IE:DE:AT:BE:CY:FI:EE:FR:IT:LU:NL:SI:SK&ifdim=world&tstart=942274800000&tend=1510354800000&hl=en&ind=false&icfg&iconSize=0.5 |title=Current account balance (%) |work=Google/IMF |date=9 October 2012 |access-date=10 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="google-current-account-bubblechart">{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&ctype=b&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_x=bca&scale_x=lin&ind_x=false&met_y=bca_ngdpd&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&met_s=bca&scale_s=lin&ind_s=false&met_c=bca_ngdpd&scale_c=lin&ind_c=false&idim=country:GR:PT:ES:IE:DE:AT:BE:CY:FI:EE:FR:IT:LU:NL:SI:SK&ifdim=country:world:Earth&tunit=Y&pit=942274800000&hl=en&ind=false&icfg&iconSize=0.5 |title=Current account balance (%) and Current account balance (US$) (animation) |work=Google/IMF |date=9 October 2012 |access-date=10 November 2012}}</ref>

Germany has come under pressure due to not having a government budget deficit and funding it by borrowing more. As of late 2014, the government (federal and state) has spent less than it receives in revenue, for the third year in a row, despite low economic growth.<ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/09/01/uk-germany-economy-idUKKBN0GW2BV20140901 Booming budget surplus puts pressure on Germany to spend] Reuters</ref> The 2015 budget includes a surplus for the first time since 1969. Current projections are that by 2019 the debt will be less than required by the [[Stability and Growth Pact]].

It has been a long known belief that austerity measures will always reduce the GDP growth in the short term. Some economists believing in [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] policies criticised the timing and amount of austerity measures being called for in the bailout programmes, as they argued such extensive measures should not be implemented during the crisis years with an ongoing recession, but if possible delayed until the years after some positive real GDP growth had returned. In October 2012, a report published by [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) also found, that tax hikes and spending cuts during the most recent decade had indeed damaged the GDP growth more severely, compared to what had been expected and forecasted in advance (based on the "GDP damage ratios" previously recorded in earlier decades and under different economic scenarios).<ref name="PlumerIMF"/> Already a half-year earlier, several European countries as a response to the problem with subdued GDP growth in the eurozone, likewise had called for the implementation of a new reinforced growth strategy based on additional public investments, to be financed by growth-friendly taxes on property, land, wealth, and financial institutions. In June 2012, EU leaders agreed as a first step to moderately increase the funds of the [[European Investment Bank]], in order to kick-start infrastructure projects and increase loans to the private sector. A few months later 11 out of 17 eurozone countries also agreed to introduce a new [[European Union financial transaction tax|EU financial transaction tax]] to be collected from 1 January 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/uk-eurozone-idUKBRE8980UG20121009 |title=Eleven euro states back financial transaction tax |work=Reuters |date=9 October 2012 |access-date=15 October 2012}}</ref>

In April 2012, [[Olli Rehn]], the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs in Brussels, "enthusiastically announced to EU parliamentarians in mid-April that 'there was a breakthrough before Easter'.

In multiple steps during 2012–2013, the ECB lowered its [[bank rate]] to historical lows, reaching 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were shaved to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 the central bank shocked financial markets by cutting the razor-thin rates by a further two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%, the lowest on record.<ref name="ECBcuts">{{cite news |title=Draghi slashes interest rates, unveils bond buying plan |url=http://www.europenews.net/index.php/sid/225407609 |date=4 September 2014 |access-date=5 September 2014 |publisher=Europe News.Net}}</ref> The moves were designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that lower cost of money would be passed on to businesses taking out loans, boosting investment in the economy.

===Increase competitiveness===
{{see also|Euro Plus Pact}}

Crisis countries must significantly increase their international competitiveness to generate economic growth and improve their [[terms of trade]]. Indian-American journalist [[Fareed Zakaria]] notes in November 2011 that no debt restructuring will work without growth, even more so as European countries "face pressures from three fronts: demography (an aging population), technology (which has allowed companies to do much more with fewer people) and globalisation (which has allowed manufacturing and services to locate across the world)".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/10/europes-real-problem-lack-of-growth/ |author=Fareed Zakaria |title=CNN Fareed Zakaria GPS |publisher=[[CNN World News]] |date=10 November 2011 |access-date=14 May 2012|author-link=Fareed Zakaria }}</ref>

In case of economic shocks, policy makers typically try to improve competitiveness by [[External devaluation|depreciating the currency]], as in the case of Iceland, which suffered the largest [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis|financial crisis in 2008–2011]] in economic history but has since vastly improved its position. Eurozone countries cannot devalue their currency.

Germany has successfully pushed its economic competitiveness by increasing the [[value added tax]] (VAT) by three percentage points in 2007, and using part of the additional revenues to lower employer's [[unemployment insurance]] contribution.

On 15 November 2011, the Lisbon Council published the Euro Plus Monitor 2011. According to the report most critical eurozone member countries are in the process of rapid reforms. The authors note that "Many of those countries most in need to adjust <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> are now making the greatest progress towards restoring their fiscal balance and external competitiveness".
Greece, Ireland and Spain are among the top five reformers and Portugal is ranked seventh among 17 countries included in the report (see graph).<ref name="Euro_Plus_Monitor_2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.lisboncouncil.net//index.php?option=com_downloads&id=557 |title=Euro Plus Monitor 2011 |work=The Lisbon Council |date=15 November 2011 |access-date=17 November 2011}}</ref>

In its Euro Plus Monitor Report 2012, published in November 2012, the Lisbon Council finds that the eurozone has slightly improved its overall health. With the exception of Greece, all eurozone crisis countries are either close to the point where they have achieved the major adjustment or are likely to get there over the course of 2013. Portugal and Italy are expected to progress to the turnaround stage in spring 2013, possibly followed by Spain in autumn, while the fate of Greece continues to hang in the balance. Overall, the authors suggest that if the eurozone gets through the current acute crisis and stays on the reform path "it could eventually emerge from the crisis as the most dynamic of the major Western economies".<ref name="Euro_Plus_Monitor_2012">{{cite web |url=http://www.lisboncouncil.net//index.php?option=com_downloads&id=723 |title=Euro Plus Monitor 2012 |work=The Lisbon Council |date=29 November 2012 |access-date=26 December 2012}}</ref>

The Euro Plus Monitor update from spring 2013 notes that the eurozone remains on the right track. According to the authors, almost all vulnerable countries in need of adjustment "are slashing their underlying fiscal deficits and improving their external competitiveness at an impressive speed", for which they expected the eurozone crisis to be over by the end of 2013.<ref name="Euro_Plus_Monitor_2013_update">{{cite web |url=http://www.lisboncouncil.net/publication/publication/91-the-euro-plus-monitor-spring-2013-update.html |title=Euro Plus Monitor Spring 2013 update |work=The Lisbon Council |date=Spring 2013 |access-date=9 November 2013}}</ref>

===Address current account imbalances===

Regardless of the corrective measures chosen to solve the current predicament, as long as cross border capital flows remain unregulated in the euro area,<ref>{{cite web |last=Grabel |first=Ilene |url=http://www.fpif.org/reports/portfolio_investment |title=Foreign Policy in Focus, Portfolio Investment |publisher=Fpif.org |date=1 May 1998 |access-date=5 May 2010}}</ref> [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] imbalances are likely to continue. A country that runs a large current account or trade deficit (i.e., importing more than it exports) must ultimately be a net importer of capital; this is a mathematical [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] called the [[balance of payments]].
In other words, a country that imports more than it exports must either decrease its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports. Conversely, Germany's large trade surplus (net export position) means that it must either increase its savings reserves or be a net exporter of capital, lending money to other countries to allow them to buy German goods.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/20/AR2010052005278.html |work=The Washington Post |first=Steven |last=Pearlstein |title=Forget Greece: Europe's real problem is Germany |date=21 May 2010}}</ref>

The 2009 trade deficits for Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal were estimated to be $42.96bn, $75.31bn and $35.97bn, and $25.6bn respectively, while Germany's trade surplus was $188.6bn.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html |title=CIA Factbook-Data |publisher=CIA |access-date=23 September 2011}}</ref> A similar imbalance exists in the US, which runs a large trade deficit (net import position) and therefore is a net borrower of capital from abroad. [[Ben Bernanke]] warned of the risks of such imbalances in 2005, arguing that a "savings glut" in one country with a trade surplus can drive capital into other countries with trade deficits, artificially lowering interest rates and creating asset bubbles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050414/default.htm |title=Ben Bernanke-U.S. Federal Reserve-The Global Savings Glut and U.S. Current Account Balance-March 2005 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |access-date=15 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02krugman.html |work=The New York Times |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=Revenge of the Glut |date=2 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/defending-greece-against-failed-neoliberal-policies-through-the-creation-of-sovereign-debt-for-the-productive-economy/2010/02/06 |title=P2P Foundation " Blog Archive " Defending Greece against failed neoliberal policies through the creation of sovereign debt for the productive economy |publisher=Blog.p2pfoundation.net |date=6 February 2010 |access-date=5 May 2010}}</ref>

A country with a large trade surplus would generally see the value of its currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.<ref name=CNN01/>

Either way, many of the countries involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit.<ref name=CNN01>{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/09/07/247884/index.htm |publisher=CNN |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=Saving Asia: It's Time To Get Radical |date=7 September 1998}}</ref> It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.
On the other hand, export driven countries with a large trade surplus, such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands would need to shift their economies more towards domestic services and increase wages to support domestic consumption.<ref name="MWBOP">{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/396ff020-1ffd-11e1-8662-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1fwLi3F1I |title=Merkozy failed to save the eurozone |work=Financial Times |author=Martin Wolf |date=6 December 2011 |access-date=9 December 2011|author-link=Martin Wolf }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/meinung/eu-gipfel-und-der-kampf-um-den-euro-starker-mann-was-nun-1.1229181 |newspaper=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung|Sueddeutsche]] |first=Alexander |last=Hagelüken |title=Starker Mann, was nun? |date=8 December 2012}}</ref>

Economic evidence indicates the crisis may have more to do with trade deficits (which require private borrowing to fund) than public debt levels. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in March 2013: "... the really strong relationship within the [eurozone countries] is between interest spreads and current account deficits, which is in line with the conclusion many of us have reached, that the euro area crisis is really a [[balance of payments crisis]], not a debt crisis".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/fatal-fiscal-attractions/ |title=Fatal Fiscal Attractions |access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref> A February 2013 paper from four economists concluded that, "Countries with debt above 80% of GDP and persistent current-account [trade] deficits are vulnerable to a rapid fiscal deterioration.&nbsp;..."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/22/predicting-a-crisis-repeatedly/ |title=Predicting a Crisis, Repeatedly |first=Binyamin |last=Appelbaum }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://research.chicagobooth.edu/igm/usmpf/download2.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226092538/http://research.chicagobooth.edu/igm/usmpf/download2.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 February 2013 |title=Greenlaw, Hamilton, Hooper, Mishkin Crunch Time: Fiscal Crises and the Role of Monetary Policy-February 2013 |publisher=Research.chicagobooth.edu |date=29 July 2013 |access-date=3 August 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/no-the-united-states-will-never-ever-turn-into-greece/273748/ |title=The Atlantic-No, the United States Will Never, Ever Turn Into Greece |author=Mathew O'Brien |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |date=7 March 2013 |access-date=3 August 2013}}</ref>

===Commentary===
US President [[Barack Obama]] stated in June 2012: "Right now, [Europe's] focus has to be on strengthening their overall banking system...making a series of decisive actions that give people confidence that the banking system is solid&nbsp;... In addition, they're going to have to look at how do they achieve growth at the same time as they're carrying out structural reforms that may take two or three or five years to fully accomplish. So countries like Spain and Italy, for example, have embarked on some smart structural reforms that everybody thinks are necessary—everything from tax collection to labour markets to a whole host of different issues. But they've got to have the time and the space for those steps to succeed. And if they are just cutting and cutting and cutting, and their unemployment rate is going up and up and up, and people are pulling back further from spending money because they're feeling a lot of pressure—ironically, that can actually make it harder for them to carry out some of these reforms over the long term&nbsp;... [I]n addition to sensible ways to deal with debt and government finances, there's a parallel discussion that's taking place among European leaders to figure out how do we also encourage growth and show some flexibility to allow some of these reforms to really take root."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/08/remarks-president |title=President Obama-Remarks by the President-June 2012 |publisher=[[whiteHouse.gov]] |date=6 August 2012 |access-date=3 August 2013}}</ref>

''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in June 2012: "Outside Germany, a consensus has developed on what [[Angela Merkel|Mrs. Merkel]] must do to preserve the single currency. It includes shifting from austerity to a far greater focus on economic growth; complementing the single currency with a banking union (with euro-wide deposit insurance, bank oversight and joint means for the recapitalisation or resolution of failing banks); and embracing a limited form of debt mutualisation to create a joint safe asset and allow peripheral economies the room gradually to reduce their debt burdens. This is the refrain from Washington, Beijing, London, and indeed most of the capitals of the euro zone.

A group of economists from [[Princeton University]] suggest a new form of [[European Safe Bonds]] (ESBies), i.e. bundled European government bonds (70% senior bonds, 30% junior bonds) in the form of a "union-wide safe asset without joint liability". According to the authors, ESBies "would be at least as safe as German bonds and approximately double the supply of euro safe assets when protected by a 30%-thick junior tranche". ESBies could be issued by public or private-sector entities and would "weaken the diabolic loop and its diffusion across countries". It requires "no significant change in treaties or legislation.“<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brunnermeier |first1=Markus K |last2=Pagano |first2=Marco |last3=Langfield |first3=Sam |last4=Nieuwerburgh |first4=Stijn Van |last5=Vayanos |first5=Dimitri |year=2017 |title=ESBies: Safety in the Tranches |journal=[[Economic Policy]] |volume= 32|issue= 90|pages= 175–219|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/markus/files/ESBies_Safety_in_the_Tranches_10e.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129175956/http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/markus/files/ESBies_Safety_in_the_Tranches_10e.pdf |archive-date=29 January 2017  |access-date=29 January 2017|doi=10.1093/epolic/eix004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://voxeu.org/article/esbies-realistic-reform-europes-financial-architecture |title=ESBies: A realistic reform of Europe's financial architecture |work=[[Vox EU]] |date=25 October 2011 |access-date=27 January 2017}}</ref>

===European Monetary Fund===
{{Main|European Stability Mechanism}}
On 20 October 2011, the [[Austrian Institute of Economic Research]] published an article that suggests transforming the EFSF into a [[European Monetary Fund]] (EMF), which could provide governments with fixed interest rate Eurobonds at a rate slightly below medium-term economic growth (in nominal terms). These bonds would not be tradable but could be held by investors with the EMF and liquidated at any time. Given the backing of all eurozone countries and the ECB, "the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]] would achieve a similarly strong position vis-à-vis financial investors as the US where the [[Federal Reserve System|Fed]] backs government bonds to an unlimited extent". To ensure fiscal discipline despite lack of market pressure, the EMF would operate according to strict rules, providing funds only to countries that meet fiscal and macroeconomic criteria.
Governments lacking sound financial policies would be forced to rely on traditional (national) governmental bonds with less favourable market rates.<ref name="schulmeister">{{cite web |url=http://stephan.schulmeister.wifo.ac.at/fileadmin/homepage_schulmeister/files/EMF_Concept_07_11.pdf |title=The European Monetary Fund: A systemic problem needs a systemic solution |last=Schulmeister |first=Stephan |publisher=[[Austrian Institute of Economic Research]] |date=20 October 2011 |access-date=9 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041628/http://stephan.schulmeister.wifo.ac.at/fileadmin/homepage_schulmeister/files/EMF_Concept_07_11.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The econometric analysis suggests that "If the short-term and long- term interest rates in the euro area were stabilised at 1.5% and 3%, respectively, aggregate output (GDP) in the euro area would be 5 percentage points above baseline in 2015". At the same time, sovereign debt levels would be significantly lower with, e.g., Greece's debt level falling below 110% of GDP, more than 40 [[percentage point]]s below the baseline scenario with market-based interest levels. Furthermore, banks would no longer be able to benefit unduly from intermediary profits by borrowing from the ECB at low rates and investing in government bonds at high rates.<ref name="schulmeister"/>

According to the [[Bank for International Settlements]], the combined private and public debt of 18 [[OECD]] countries nearly quadrupled between 1980 and 2010, and will likely continue to grow, reaching between 250% (for Italy) and about 600% (for Japan) by 2040.<ref name="BIS-debt">{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/work352.pdf |title=The real effects of debt (BIS Working Paper No. 352) |author1=Stephen G Cecchetti |author2=M S Mohanty |author3=Fabrizio Zampolli |publisher=[[Bank for International Settlements]] |date=September 2011 |access-date=15 February 2012 }}</ref> A BIS study released in June 2012 warns that budgets of most advanced economies, excluding interest payments, "would need 20 consecutive years of surpluses exceeding 2 per cent of gross domestic product—starting now—just to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio back to its pre-crisis level".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4e3340a4-bc86-11e1-a470-00144feabdc0.html |title=Global economy is stuck in a vicious cycle, warns BIS |work=The Financial Times |author=Norma Cohen |date=24 June 2012 |access-date=21 July 2012|author-link=Norma Cohen }}</ref> The same authors found in a previous study that increased financial burden imposed by ageing populations and lower growth makes it unlikely that indebted economies can grow out of their debt problem if only one of the following three conditions is met:<ref name="BIS-The-real-effects-of-debt">{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/work300.htm |title=The Future of Public Debt: Prospects and Implications" (BIS Working Paper No. 300) |author1=Stephen G Cecchetti |author2=M S Mohanty |author3=Fabrizio Zampolli |publisher=[[Bank for International Settlements]] |date=March 2010 |access-date=15 February 2012}}</ref>
* government debt is more than 80 to 100% of GDP;
* non-financial corporate debt is more than 90% of GDP;
* private [[household debt]] is more than 85% of GDP.

The first condition, suggested by an influential paper written by [[Kenneth Rogoff]] & [[Carmen Reinhart]] has been disputed due to major calculation errors. In fact, the average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90% is not dramatically different from when debt/GDP ratios are lower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418125353/http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566/|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 April 2013 |title=Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth?

The [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG) adds that if the overall debt load continues to grow faster than the economy, then large-scale debt restructuring becomes inevitable. To prevent a vicious upward debt spiral from gaining momentum the authors urge policymakers to "act quickly and decisively" and aim for an overall debt level well below 180% for the private and government sector. This number is based on the assumption that governments, non-financial corporations, and private households can each sustain a debt load of 60% of GDP, at an interest rate of five per cent and a nominal economic growth rate of three per cent per year. Lower interest rates and/or higher growth would help reduce the debt burden further.<ref name="BCG-Mesopotamia">{{cite news |url=http://www.bcg.at/documents/file87307.pdf |work=Boston Consulting Group |title=Back to Mesopotamia?: The Looming Threat of Debt Restructuring |date=23 September 2011 }}</ref>

To reach sustainable levels the eurozone must reduce its overall debt level by €6.1 trillion. According to BCG, this could be financed by a one-time [[wealth tax]] of between 11 and 30% for most countries, apart from the crisis countries (particularly Ireland) where a write-off would have to be substantially higher. The authors admit that such programmes would be "drastic", "unpopular" and "require broad political coordination and leadership" but they maintain that the longer politicians and central bankers wait, the more necessary such a step will be.<ref name="BCG-Mesopotamia"/>

[[Thomas Piketty]], French economist and author of the bestselling book ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than ''austerity'' (inefficient and unjust) and ''inflation'' (only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital). According to his analysis, a [[flat tax]] of 15 percent on private wealth would provide the state with nearly a year's worth national income, which would allow for immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt.<ref>{{cite book |last=Piketty |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Piketty |title=Capital in the Twenty-First Century |publisher=[[Harvard University Press|Belknap Press of Harvard University Press]] |edition=1st |location=Cambridge, USA |date=2013 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674430006/page/540 540] |isbn=9780674430006 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674430006/page/540 }}</ref>

===Debt write-off based on international agreement===
In 2015 Hans-Werner Sinn, president of German [[Ifo Institute for Economic Research]], called for a debt relief for Greece.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/presse/Pressemitteilungen/Pressemitteilungen-Archiv/2015/Q1/press_20150106_Griechenland.html |title=Ifo President Sinn Calls For International Debt Conference on Greece |date=6 January 2015 |access-date=20 January 2015}}</ref> In addition, economists from London School of Economics suggested a debt relief similar to the [[London Agreement on German External Debts|London agreement]]. In 1953, private sector lenders as well as governments agreed to write off about half of [[West Germany]]’s outstanding debt; this was followed by the beginning of Germany's "economic miracle" (or ''{{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}}''). According to this agreement, West Germany had to make repayments only when it was running a trade surplus, that is "when it had earned the money to pay up, rather than having to borrow more, or dip into its foreign currency reserves. Its repayments were also limited to 3% of export earnings." As LSE researchers note, this had the effect that, Germany's creditors had an incentive to buy the country's goods, so that it would be able to afford to pay them.<ref name="Guardian-2015-01-18"/>

==Controversies==
{{main|Controversies surrounding the Eurozone crisis}}

===EU treaty violations===
{{wikisource|Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union}}
;No bail-out clause
The EU's [[Maastricht Treaty]] contains juridical language that appears to rule out intra-EU bailouts. First, the "no bail-out" clause ([[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title VIII: Economic and Monetary Policy#Article 125|Article 125 TFEU]]) ensures that the responsibility for repaying public debt remains national and prevents risk premiums caused by unsound fiscal policies from spilling over to partner countries. The clause thus encourages prudent fiscal policies at the national level.

The [[European Central Bank]]'s purchase of distressed country bonds can be viewed as violating the prohibition of monetary financing of budget deficits ([[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title VIII: Economic and Monetary Policy#Article 123|Article 123 TFEU]]). The creation of further leverage in EFSF with access to ECB lending would also appear to violate the terms of this article.

Articles 125 and 123 were meant to create disincentives for EU member states to run excessive deficits and state debt, and prevent the [[moral hazard]] of over-spending and lending in good times. They were also meant to protect the taxpayers of the other more prudent member states.
By issuing bail-out aid guaranteed by prudent eurozone taxpayers to rule-breaking eurozone countries such as Greece, the EU and eurozone countries also encourage moral hazard in the future.<ref>{{cite news |title=How the Euro Zone Ignored Its Own Rules |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,790333,00.html |work=Der Spiegel |date=6 October 2011 |access-date=6 October 2011}}</ref> While the no bail-out clause remains in place, the "no bail-out doctrine" seems to be a thing of the past.<ref>{{cite web |last=Verhelst |first=Stijn |title=The Reform of European Economic Governance : Towards a Sustainable Monetary Union? |url=http://www.egmontinstitute.be/paperegm/ep47.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425052049/http://www.egmontinstitute.be/paperegm/ep47.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 April 2012 |publisher=Egmont&nbsp;– Royal Institute for International Relations |access-date=17 October 2011 }}</ref>

;Convergence criteria
The EU treaties contain so called [[Euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]], specified in the protocols of the [[Treaties of the European Union]]. As regards government finance, the states agreed that the annual [[government budget deficit]] should not exceed 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) and that the gross [[government debt]] to GDP should not exceed 60% of GDP (see [[s:Consolidated protocols, annexes and declarations attached to the treaties of the European Union/Protocols#PROTOCOL (No 12) ON THE EXCESSIVE DEFICIT PROCEDURE|protocol 12 and 13]]). For [[eurozone]] members there is the [[Stability and Growth Pact]], which contains the same requirements for budget deficit and debt limitation but with a much stricter regime. In the past, many European countries have substantially exceeded these criteria over a long period of time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Public Finances in EMU&nbsp;– 2011 |publisher=European Commission, Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs |url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2011/pdf/ee-2011-3_en.pdf |access-date=12 July 2012 }}</ref> Around 2005 most eurozone members violated the pact, resulting in no action taken against violators.

France too has shown its anger at its downgrade. French central bank chief [[Christian Noyer]] criticised the decision of Standard & Poor's to lower the rating of France but not that of the United Kingdom, which "has more deficits, as much debt, more inflation, less growth than us".<ref name="guardian_14_01_2012">{{cite news |author1=Larry Elliott |author2=Phillip Inman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/13/eurozone-crisis-france-credit-rating-aaa |title=Eurozone in new crisis as ratings agency downgrades nine countries |work=The Guardian |date=14 January 2012 |access-date=9 January 2017 |location=London}}</ref>

Similar comments were made by high-ranking politicians in Germany. [[Michael Fuchs (politician)|Michael Fuchs]], deputy leader of the leading [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]], said: "Standard and Poor's must stop playing politics.

He further added: "If the agency downgrades France, it should also downgrade Britain in order to be consistent."<ref name="guardian_14_01_2012"/>

Credit rating agencies were also accused of bullying politicians by systematically downgrading eurozone countries just before important European Council meetings. As one EU source put it: "It is interesting to look at the downgradings and the timings of the downgradings... It is strange that we have so many downgrades in the weeks of summits."<ref>{{cite news |author1=Nicholas Watt |author2=Ian Traynor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/07/cameron-threatens-veto-eu-treaty |title=David Cameron threatens veto if EU treaty fails to protect City of London |work=The Guardian |date=7 December 2011 |access-date=7 December 2011}}</ref>

;Regulatory reliance on credit ratings
Think-tanks such as the {{interlanguage link|World Pensions Council (WPC)|fr| Forum Mondial des Fonds de Pension|vertical-align=sup}} have criticised European powers such as France and Germany for pushing for the adoption of the [[Basel II]] recommendations, adopted in 2005 and transposed in European Union law through the [[Capital Requirements Directive]] (CRD), effective since 2008. In essence, this forced European banks and more importantly the [[European Central Bank]], e.g. when gauging the [[solvency]] of EU-based financial institutions, to rely heavily on the standardised assessments of [[credit risk]] marketed by only two private US firms- Moody's and S&P.<ref>M.

;Breakup vs. deeper integration
There is opposition in this view. The national exits are expected to be an expensive proposition. The breakdown of the currency would lead to insolvency of several euro zone countries, a breakdown in intrazone payments. Having instability and the public debt issue still not solved, the contagion effects and instability would spread into the system.<ref>Anand. M.R, Gupta.G.L, Dash, R.

The challenges to the speculation about the break-up or salvage of the eurozone is rooted in its innate nature that the break-up or salvage of eurozone is not only an economic decision but also a critical political decision followed by complicated ramifications that "If Berlin pays the bills and tells the rest of Europe how to behave, it risks fostering destructive nationalist resentment against Germany and&nbsp;... it would strengthen the camp in Britain arguing for an exit—a problem not just for Britons but for all economically liberal Europeans.<ref name="The Economist"/> Solutions which involve greater integration of European banking and fiscal management and supervision of national decisions by European umbrella institutions can be criticised as Germanic domination of European political and economic life.<ref name=NYTRDAH>{{cite news |title=Sympathy for the Radical Left |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/opinion/sunday/douthat-sympathy-for-the-radical-left.html |access-date=17 June 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=16 June 2012 |author=Ross Douthat |quote=This would effectively turn the European Union into a kind of postmodern version of the old Austro-Hungarian empire, with a Germanic elite presiding uneasily over a polyglot imperium and its restive local populations.}}</ref> According to US author [[Ross Douthat]] "This would effectively turn the European Union into a kind of postmodern version of the old [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], with a Germanic elite presiding uneasily over a polyglot imperium and its restive local populations".<ref name=NYTRDAH/>

''[[The Economist]]'' provides a somewhat modified approach to saving the euro in that "a limited version of [[federalisation]] could be less miserable solution than break-up of the euro".<ref name="The Economist">{{cite news |title=The Choice |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21555916?scode=3d26b0b17065c2cf29c06c010184c684 |access-date=5 June 2012 |newspaper=The Economist |date=26 May 2012}}</ref> The recipe to this tricky combination of the limited federalisation, greatly lies on mutualisation for limiting the [[fiscal integration]]. In order for overindebted countries to stabilise the dwindling euro and economy, the overindebted countries require "access to money and for banks to have a "safe" euro-wide class of assets that is not tied to the fortunes of one country" which could be obtained by "narrower [[Eurobond (eurozone)|Eurobond]] that mutualises a limited amount of debt for a limited amount of time".<ref name="The Economist"/> The proposition made by [[German Council of Economic Experts]] provides detailed blue print to mutualise the current debts of all euro-zone economies above 60% of their GDP. Instead of the break-up and issuing new national governments bonds by individual euro-zone governments, "everybody, from Germany (debt: 81% of GDP) to Italy (120%) would issue only these joint bonds until their national debts fell to the 60% threshold. The new mutualised-bond market, worth some €2.3 trillion, would be paid off over the next 25 years. Each country would pledge a specified tax (such as a VAT surcharge) to provide the cash." So far, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] has opposed all forms of mutualisation.<ref name="The Economist"/>

The Hungarian-American business magnate [[George Soros]] warns in "Does the Euro have a Future?" that there is no escape from the "gloomy scenario" of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone's political cohesion so long as "the authorities persist in their current course". He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union.<ref name="nybooks.com">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/oct/13/does-euro-have-future/?pagination=false |title=Does the Euro Have a Future? by George Soros &#124; The New York Review of Books |magazine=[[The New York Review of Books|NY Books]] |date=13 October 2011 |access-date=14 May 2012}}</ref> Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, the European Council could then authorise the ECB to "step into the breach", with risks to the ECB's solvency being indemnified.
Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate "a radical change of heart". In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes that a collapse of the European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus "the only way" to avert "another Great Depression" is the formation of a European Treasury.<ref name="nybooks.com"/>

===Manipulated debt and deficit statistics===
In 1992, members of the European Union signed an agreement known as the [[Maastricht Treaty]], under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels through the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures.<ref name=Secret>{{cite journal |ssrn=1323190 |title=Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008 |first=Michael |last=Simkovic |journal=[[American Bankruptcy Law Journal]] |volume=83 |page=253 |year=2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}</ref><ref name="World Bank">{{cite journal |ssrn=1738539 |title=Michael Simkovic, Bankruptcy Immunities, Transparency, and Capital Structure, Presentation at the World Bank |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1738539 |publisher=[[Social Science Research Network|SSRN]] |date=11 January 2011 |last1=Simkovic |first1=Michael |s2cid=153617560 }}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}</ref> The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties.<ref name="Secret"/> Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.<ref name="Paving">{{cite web |ssrn=1585955 |title=Michael Simkovic, Paving the Way for the Next Financial Crisis, Banking & Financial Services Policy Report |volume=29 |issue=3 |publisher=SSRN |date=1 January 2010 }}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}</ref>

The revision of Greece's 2009 budget deficit from a forecast of "6–8% of GDP" to 12.7% by the new Pasok Government in late 2009 (a number which, after reclassification of expenses under IMF/EU supervision was further raised to 15.4% in 2010) has been cited as one of the issues that ignited the Greek debt crisis.

This added a new dimension in the world financial turmoil, as the issues of "[[creative accounting]]" and manipulation of statistics by several nations came into focus, potentially undermining investor confidence.

The focus has naturally remained on Greece due to its debt crisis. There have been reports about manipulated statistics by EU and other nations aiming, as was the case for Greece, to mask the sizes of public debts and deficits.

After extensive negotiations to implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries, on 4 October 2011, a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached. The expectation is that only Finland will utilise it, due, in part, to a requirement to contribute initial capital to [[European Stability Mechanism]] in one instalment instead of five instalments over time. Finland, as one of the strongest AAA countries, can raise the required capital with relative ease.<ref>{{cite news |title=Finnish win Greek collateral deal |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2011/october/finnish-win-greek-collateral-deal/72177.aspx |publisher=[[European Voice]] |date=4 October 2011 |access-date=4 October 2011}}</ref>
