==History==
Initially intended as a night school, Georgia State University was established in 1913 as the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia School of Technology]]'s Evening School of Commerce.<ref name="97 Years Strong">{{cite web|title=97 Years Strong|url=http://www.georgiastatesports.com//pdf8/705701.pdf|publisher=Georgia State University|access-date=June 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111134243/http://www.georgiastatesports.com//pdf8/705701.pdf|archive-date=November 11, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A reorganization of the [[University System of Georgia]] in the 1930s led to the school becoming the Atlanta Extension Center of the University System of Georgia and allowed night students to earn degrees from several colleges in the University System.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwmsp/2006/history/1.htm|work=Main Street Master Plan|publisher=Georgia State University|access-date=May 28, 2013}}</ref> During this time, the school was divided into two divisions: Georgia Evening College and Atlanta Junior College.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evening Signal, 1933-10-02|url=http://digitalcollections.library.gsu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/signal/id/247/rec/4|work=Digital Collections|publisher=Georgia State University Library|access-date=May 28, 2013}}</ref> In September 1947, the school became affiliated with the [[University of Georgia]] and was named the Atlanta Division of the University of Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.library.gsu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/signal/id/927/rec/60|title=The Georgia State University Signal, 1970-10-22.|work=Digital Collections|publisher=Georgia State University Library|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202125541/http://digitalcollections.library.gsu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/signal/id/5603/rec/1|archive-date=February 2, 2014|url-status=dead|access-date=May 28, 2013}}</ref>

For its first four decades, the school was treated as an offsite department of its parent institution, Georgia Tech, until 1947, and UGA after 1947. Accordingly, its chief executive was called a director.<ref name=specialcollection/> However, in 1955, the Board of Regents made it an autonomous four-year college under the name Georgia State College of Business Administration.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carabello|first=Joanna Soto|title=J.

In 1961, other programs at the school had grown large enough that the name was shortened to Georgia State College.<ref name=specialcollection>{{cite web |title=Special Collections and Archives: Georgia State University History|url=http://research.library.gsu.edu/GSUhistory|work=Research Guides|publisher=Georgia State University Library |access-date=May 28, 2013}}</ref> It became Georgia State University in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Merl|title=In Business |url=http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwexa/GSU_Magazine_Special_2013.pdf|work=Georgia State University Magazine|publisher=Georgia State University|access-date=May 28, 2013}}</ref>

In 1995, the [[Georgia Board of Regents]] accorded Georgia State "research university" status, joining the [[University of Georgia]], the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], and [[Augusta University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Core Mission Statement for Research Universities|url=http://www.usg.edu/inst/mission/category/research_universities|publisher=University System of Georgia |access-date=May 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Achieving Research University Status|url=http://100.gsu.edu/|work=Making History|publisher=Georgia State University|access-date=May 29, 2013}}</ref>

===Campus expansion===

====1913–1975====
Over its 100-plus year history, Georgia State's growth has required the acquisition and construction of more space to suit its needs. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, numerous buildings were constructed as part of a major urban renewal project, such as the Pullen Library in 1966, Classroom South in 1968, the expansion of the Pullen Library in 1968, the Arts and Humanities Building in 1970, the 10-story General Classroom Building in 1971 (now called Langdale Hall), the [[GSU Sports Arena|Sports Arena]] in 1973, and the 12-story Urban Life Building in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|title=Campus Expansion |url=http://100.gsu.edu/|publisher=Georgia State University|access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref> In addition, a raised platform and walkway system was constructed to connect these buildings with each other over [[Decatur Street (Atlanta)|Decatur Street]] and various parking structures.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elrod|first=Jacoby|title=Georgia State's Platform Plaza |url=http://history4220fall2011.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/georgia-states-platform-plaza/|work=The American City|publisher=James Polhemus|access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref>

====1980–1989====

==Organization==
[[File:Georgia State University College of Law Building.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|GSU College of Law]]
The President of Georgia State University (currently Mark P.

The university is composed of 11 colleges (although those divisions use "college", "school", or "institute", those titles do not indicate any distinction between them):

===Schools and colleges===
* [[Andrew Young School of Policy Studies]]
* [[Byrdine F. Lewis College of Nursing and Health Professions]]
* College of the Arts
* College of Arts & Sciences
* College of Education and Human Development
* [[J. Mack Robinson College of Business]]
* [[Georgia State University College of Law|College of Law]]

* Institute for Biomedical Sciences
* Honors College
* [[Georgia Perimeter College|Perimeter College]]†

† Unlike the other colleges that make up the university, students accepted to Perimeter College only have access to the five suburban campuses associated with that college and not the main campus. A Perimeter College student must apply for acceptance to the main downtown campus for access to bachelor's degrees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Transition to the Atlanta Campus from a Perimeter College Campus|url=https://perimeter.gsu.edu/admissions/apply/transition/|website=GSU.edu|publisher=Georgia State University|access-date=January 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075756/https://perimeter.gsu.edu/admissions/apply/transition/|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Sparks Hall ===
Sparks Hall was the first building designed and built specifically for the school. It was designed by the Atlanta architectural firm of Cooper, Barrett, Skinner, Woodbury, and Cooper. Construction took place between 1952 and 1955 and cost about $2 million. The first classes were held in the building on April 21, 1955. On June 8, 1960, the building was named for George McIntosh Sparks, former president of the college.<ref>{{cite web|title=Campus Historic Preservation Plan|url=http://atlantapreservation.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/03_GSU-PRESERVATION-PLAN-LD_Pages.pdf|publisher=Georgia State University|access-date=June 6, 2014}}</ref> Currently, the building houses Undergraduate Admissions, the Student Advisement Center, and the One Stop Shop.
