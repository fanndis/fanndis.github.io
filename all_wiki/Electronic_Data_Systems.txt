'''Electronic Data Systems''' ('''EDS''') was an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] information technology equipment and services company headquartered in [[Plano, Texas]].

== History ==

Electronic Data Systems (EDS) was founded in 1962 by [[Ross Perot|H. Ross Perot]], a graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy]] and a successful [[IBM]] salesman who firsthand observed how inefficiently IBM's customers typically were using their expensive systems.  Somewhat to IBM's chagrin, since the company sold as many computers as possible, Perot made a fortune changing this.  An early success was in matching the unused computer time at Southwestern Life Insurance Company with the computing needs of rapidly expanding [[Rockwell Collins|Collins Radio]], both located in Dallas, Texas.  Perot knew the inside details of both companies.<ref name=MakingITWork-2017>{{cite book|last1=Yost|first1=Jeffrey R.|title=Making IT Work: A History of the Computer Services Industry|date=2017|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-03672-6|oclc=978286108}}</ref>

In its early years, EDS was a pioneer in [[Facility management|facilities management]] (becoming the IT department for many companies) as well as beginning to service banks and provide early support for both [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in its home state of Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eds.com/about/history/timeline.aspx |title=History: From EDS' first IT contract in 1962 / eds.com |work=Internet Archive Wayback Engine |date=2009 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331200616/http://www.eds.com/about/history/timeline.aspx |archive-date=March 31, 2009 |access-date=2015-04-08 |quote=EDS vaulted into the new century with a much celebrated Y2K rollover, performing more than 1,300 successful projects for clients around the world. As EDS celebrated its 40-year anniversary in 2002, the industry it created contributed more than $500 billion to the global economy – nearly half of the world's IT spending }}</ref> Leading the effort internally was [[Morton Meyerson|Morton H. Meyerson]], who joined the company in 1966 as the company's 54th employee. In 1967, he proposed the business model that eventually became known as "[[outsourcing]]"<ref>{{cite web

   |quote=IAOP Announces ... and Mort Meyerson have help shape ...}}</ref> and which led to exponential growth for EDS.

In the 1970s, EDS expanded initially into more insurance services and later [[credit union]]s, and by 1975 revenue topped $100 million and the company began bidding for work internationally. In 1978 EDS expanded into financial markets with the arrival of [[automated teller machine]]s, [[electronic funds transfer]]s and real-time point-of-sale terminals. Meyerson was named president in 1979, at which point EDS had revenue of $270 million, was free of debt, and had 8,000 employees.

In the 1980s, they expanded into travel services supporting payment services between travel agents and airlines represented by the [[Air Transport Association of America]] and provided large scale contracts for the US military.

In 1984, the company was acquired by [[General Motors]] for $2.5 billion, with EDS becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of GM. Meyerson remained president and in 1985, the company had a presence in 21 countries with 40,000 employees. Meyerson retired in 1987. During his years of executive leadership, EDS revenue grew to $4 billion a year, and the company grew to 45,000 employees. By the end of the decade, revenue was $5 billion. In 1996, GM spun off EDS as an independent company.<ref>{{Cite news|last=McKesson|first=Mike|date=August 8, 1995|title=GM Plans to Spin Off EDS|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1995/08/08/gm-plans-to-spin-off-eds/ed5c2ce2-2836-4f1f-9f4a-a1c4b84130ec/}}</ref>

In the 1990s, in addition to its existing markets, EDS was entering the telecommunications industry and was providing IT systems in many foreign countries. They were providing information systems for global sporting events including the [[1992 Barcelona Olympics]], the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. In 1994, they signed what was at the time the largest information technology contract with [[Xerox]] for $3.2 billion and also bought the [[New Zealand]] banking processing company [[Databank Systems Limited|Databank Systems]]. In 1995 they purchased [[A.T. Kearney]], the world's 4th largest private [[management consulting]] firm. In 1996, they became an independent company again and relisted on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. Before the turn of the century they took part in over 1,300 [[Year 2000 problem|Year 2000]] projects.

In 2000, EDS launched a new logo with an award-winning [[Super Bowl XXXIV|Super Bowl]] commercial about [[Idiom|herding cats]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_MaJDK3VNE |title=EDS, an HP Company 'Cat Herders' |work=YouTube |publisher=EDS |date=2000-01-30 |access-date=2015-04-08 }}</ref> Post-2000, they continued to sign long term, billion dollar contracts with organizations such as [[Bank of America]], [[American Airlines]], General Motors, [[Kraft Foods]] and the [[United States Navy]]. In 2006 they sold A.T. Kearney in a management buyout.

On May 13, 2008, [[Hewlett-Packard Co.]] confirmed that it had reached a deal with EDS to acquire the company for $13.9 billion.<ref>{{cite news | last = Paul | first = Franklin | title = HP to buy EDS for $12.6 bln in challenge to IBM | page = 4 | publisher = Reuters | date = 2008-05-13 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/companyNews/idUKN1230539620080514 | access-date = 2008-05-13}}</ref> The deal was completed on August 26, 2008. EDS became an HP business unit and was temporarily renamed "EDS, an HP company". Ronald A. Rittenmeyer, EDS Chairman, President, and CEO, remained at the helm and reported to HP CEO [[Mark Hurd]] until his retirement.<ref>{{cite web|title=HP to Acquire EDS for $13.9 Billion |url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2008/080513a.html |publisher=HP News |access-date=24 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302085733/http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2008/080513a.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> In December 2008, HP announced that Rittenmeyer would retire at the end of the month.<ref>{{cite web|title=HP Adds EDS to its Technology Solutions Group to Better Serve Business and Public Sector Customers|url=http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=169768&jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0001#.U1fbSlWSybg|publisher=HP News|access-date=24 April 2014}}</ref>

As of 2008, EDS employed 300,000 people in 64 countries, the largest locations being the United States, India and the UK. It was ranked as one of the largest [[Service (economics)|service]] companies on the [[Fortune 500]] list with around 2,000 clients.

As of 23 September 2009, EDS began going to market as [[HP Enterprise Services]], a name change which came one year after HP announced the acquisition of EDS, and which was a critical milestone as the integration of EDS into HP neared completion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2009/090923xa.html|title=EDS, an HP Company, Becoming HP Enterprise Services|access-date=2009-09-23}}</ref>

On April 3, 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services merged with [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] to form [[DXC Technology]]. Retaining significant operations from Plano, Texas and many aspects of EDS. On June 1, 2018, DXC spun off the U.S. public services sector of the business through a [[Reverse Morris Trust]], combining with [[Vencore]] and KeyPoint Government Solutions to create a new independent and publicly traded government contractor, Perspecta.

EDS's largest clients included [[Rolls-Royce plc]], [[General Motors]], [[Bank of America]], [[Arcandor]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], [[United States Navy]], the [[UK Ministry of Defence]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]] although General Motors announced plans to move 90% of its IT work back in house over the next 3 to 5 years starting in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kwang|first=Kevin|title=GM to hire 10K IT workers, cut outsourcing|url=http://www.zdnet.com/gm-to-hire-10k-it-workers-cut-outsourcing-7000003957/|newspaper=ZDNet}}</ref>

EDS formed the National Heritage Insurance Company in 1996. The creation of this subsidiary is to manage [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] Part B services on behalf of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS), formerly the [[Health Care Financing Administration]] (HCFA). NHIC handles call center, claims processing and payment, fraud investigations, physician enrollment etc. in many states of the US.

Another large EDS client is the [[United States Navy]]. In 2000, they won a contract for the creation of a US$9 billion [[Intranet]] linking the Navy and the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], which was set to late 2006, but on March 24, 2006, was extended to 2010, adding $3 billion to the accumulated contract worth. This initiative is known as the [[Navy Marine Corps Intranet]], or simply NMCI. In 2004, NMCI accounted for about 4% of EDS's revenue. NMCI has been called the largest private network in the world, with approximately 400,000 "seats". EDS provided the network, desktops, laptops, servers, telephones, video-conferencing, satellite transceivers, and overall management of the intranet.<ref>"[http://www.eds.com/sites/nmci/about/ NMCI Overview]", EDS Website</ref>

Following on to the NMCI type of services, EDS in March 2005 won a US$4 billion contract with the UK Ministry of Defence<ref>''[http://www.eds.com/news/releases/2282/ EDS-Led Consortium Signs Contract With U.K. Ministry Of Defence For Defence Information Infrastructure Project]'', EDS Website</ref> to "consolidate numerous existing information networks into a single next-generation infrastructure&nbsp;... The network will provide seamless interaction between headquarters, battlefield support and the front line, linking about 150,000 desktop terminals and 340,000 users in approximately 2,000 locations&nbsp;..."

In February 2008 EDS signed a US$1.3 billion contract with the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, one of the largest IT projects ever undertaken in Asia. This agreement will help the Singapore government achieve a standard desktop, network and messaging/collaboration environment across its public sector by the end of fiscal year 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eds.com/news/releases/4364/ |title=Singapore Government Announces a S$1.3 Billion SOEasy Program Award to EDS-led oneMeridian Consortium |access-date=October 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113153916/http://www.eds.com/news/releases/4364/ |archive-date=January 13, 2009 }}</ref>

In October 2008, the U.S. [[Defense Information Systems Agency]] (DISA) signed a US$111 million contract with EDS. Under this contract, EDS will: conduct worldwide security reviews, deliver certification and accreditation support, provide independent evaluation of [[United States Department of Defense]] security policies, and conduct security assessments on DOD operating systems, applications, databases, and networks. DOD and EDS have had a 13-year relationship of providing DISA with a wide range of infrastructure services, hardware and software through the DISA I-Assure and Encore contract vehicles.<ref>http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2008/12/17/3861775.htm</ref>

Of historical significance, just prior to the [[Iranian Revolution|overthrow]] of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]], EDS was the IT company that developed the Iranian social security information system. During the 1979 overthrow, several EDS employees were detained by the transitioning government of Iran, causing H. Ross Perot to undertake extraordinary [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] measures to get these employees out of Iran.<ref>''[http://www.medicaid.state.ar.us/InternetSolution/general/anreps/sfy04ar/to-rh2.htm Operation HOTFOOT] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220113905/http://www.medicaid.state.ar.us/InternetSolution/general/anreps/sfy04ar/to-rh2.htm |date=2007-02-20 }}'', medicaid.state.ar.us</ref> These events were recounted in [[Ken Follett]]'s book ''[[On Wings of Eagles]]''.

== Client contract controversies  ==
* In December 2003, EDS lost a 10-year £3 billion contract to run [[Inland Revenue]] IT services after a series of serious delays in the payment of tax credits, the contract instead being awarded to the company [[Cap Gemini]]. EDS had operated systems for the Inland Revenue since 1994 but the performance of its system had been low, causing late arrival of tax credit payments for hundreds of thousands of people.<ref>{{cite news | title = Inland Revenue dumps IT provider | publisher = BBC News | date = 2003-12-11 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3310189.stm | access-date = 2008-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = EDS rallies troops over tax credits fiasco | publisher = The Register | date = 2003-12-10 | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/12/10/eds_rallies_troops_over_tax/ | access-date = 2008-01-29}}</ref>
* In 2004, EDS was criticized by the UK's [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] for its work on IT systems for the UK's [[Child Support Agency]] (CSA), which ran seriously over budget causing problems which led to the resignation of the CSA's head, Doug Smith on 2004-11-27. The system's rollout had been two years late and following its introduction in March 2003 the CSA was obliged to write off £1 billion in claims, while £750 million in child support payments from absent parents remained uncollected. An internal EDS memo was leaked that admitted that the CSA's system was "badly designed, badly tested and badly implemented". UK MPs described it as an "appalling waste of public money" and called for it to be scrapped.<ref>{{cite news |last=McCue |first=Andy |title=EDS under fire over £456m child support IT fiasco |publisher=Silicon.com |date=2004-11-18 |url=http://management.silicon.com/government/0,39024677,39126001,00.htm |access-date=2008-01-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113104603/http://management.silicon.com/government/0,39024677,39126001,00.htm |archive-date=2008-01-13 }}</ref>
* In 2006, EDS' Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) system for the [[RAF]] led to thousands of personnel not receiving correct pay due to "processing errors". EDS and MoD staff were reported to have "no definitive explanations for the errors".<ref>{{cite news|title=Payroll Alliance |publisher=[[LexisNexis]] |date=2006-08-03 |url=http://payroll.butterworths.co.uk/dataitem.asp?id=62854&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;tid=7 |access-date=2008-01-29 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = EDS's RAF pay system struggles to take off | publisher = The Register | date = 2006-05-09 | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/09/eds_jpa_raf | access-date = 2008-01-29}}</ref>
* In September 2007 EDS paid $500,000 to settle an action by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] regarding charges related to overstatement of its contract revenues in 2001–2003. At the time these caused a fall in share prices in 2002 which led to legal action against EDS from US shareholder groups.<ref>{{cite news | last = Faragher | first = Jo | title = EDS under investigation for accounting practices | publisher = Information Age | url = http://www.information-age.com/article/2002/october/eds_under_investigation_for_accounting_practices | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130103131139/http://www.information-age.com/article/2002/october/eds_under_investigation_for_accounting_practices | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2013-01-03 | access-date = 2008-01-29 }}</ref><ref name="FW">{{cite news | last = Shipman | first = Alan | title = Sky falls on EDS with biggest outsource compensation case | publisher = Finance Week | date = 2007-10-17 | url = http://www.financeweek.co.uk/item/5623 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017074124/http://www.financeweek.co.uk/item/5623 |archive-date=October 17, 2008 | access-date = 2008-01-29}}</ref>
* On 2007-10-16, British TV company [[BSkyB]] claimed £709m compensation from EDS, claiming that EDS' failure to meet its agreed service standards resulted not just from incompetence, but from fraud and deceit in the way it pitched for the contract.<ref name="FW" />
* During the BSkyB case, it was shown that a Managing Director had obtained a degree over the Internet. Lawyers for Sky were able to demonstrate that the process for awarding the degree claimed would give a degree to a dog, and that the mark attained by the dog was higher than that of the HP executive, who was questioned on his expertise and integrity. HP lost the case with a preliminary £200 million payment ordered, whilst they appeal over the £700 million total.<ref>http://www.itnews.com.au/News/165888,key-eds-witness-bought-internet-degree.aspx</ref>
* On 2008-10-10 it was reported that a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] hard drive potentially containing the details of 100,000 Armed Forces personnel could not be located by EDS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/public-sector/2008/10/our-interview-with-mod-over-ed.html|access-date=2010-11-02|title=Our interview with MoD over EDS missing hard drive - Public Sector IT Projects|date=2010-10-21}}</ref>
