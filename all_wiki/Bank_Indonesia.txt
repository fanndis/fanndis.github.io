==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Kantoor van de Javasche Bank in Batavia TMnr 60047649.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|The office of De Javasche Bank in [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]] (old Jakarta), presently the [[Museum Bank Indonesia|Bank Indonesia Museum]].]]
[[King William I of the Netherlands]] granted the right to create a private bank in the Indies in 1826 which was named '''''De Javasche Bank''''' (''Bank of Java''). It was founded on 24 January 1828 and later became the circulation bank of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The bank regulated and issued the [[Netherlands Indies gulden]].

In 1881, an office of ''De Javasche Bank'' was opened in Amsterdam. Later followed the opening of an office in New York. By 1930 the bank owned sixteen office branches in the Dutch East Indies: Bandung, Cirebon, Semarang, Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Surabaya, Malang, Kediri, Banda Aceh, Medan, Padang, Palembang, Banjarmasin, Pontianak, Makassar, and Manado.

''De Javasche Bank'' was operated as a private bank and individuals as well as industries etc. could get help in the bank's offices.<ref>Dirk Teeuwen, no date.

Bank Indonesia was founded on 1 July 1953 from the nationalisation of ''De Javasche Bank'', three years after the recognition of Indonesia's independence by Netherlands.
<ref>Brief useful notes on the history of Bank Indonesia for various periods since 1953 are on the Bank Indonesia website at "[https://www.bi.go.id/en/tentang-bi/museum/sejarah-bi/bi/Pages/historybi1.aspx History of Bank Indonesia Institution]".

For the next 15 years, Bank Indonesia carried on commercial activities as well as acting as the nation's national bank and is in charge in issuing [[Indonesian rupiah]] currency. This came to an end with the Act No. 13 of 1968 on the Central Bank, transforming Bank Indonesia as a central bank.

The act was subsequently replaced by Act No. 23 of 1999, giving the bank independence from governmental control. Thereafter, the bank reported to the parliament ([[People's Representative Council|DPR]]) instead of the President, and the bank's governor was no longer a member of the cabinet.

==Organization==
The bank is led by the board of governors, comprising the governor, a senior deputy governor and at between four and seven deputy governors.

The governor and deputy governors serve a five-year term, and are eligible for re-election for a maximum of two terms. The governor and senior deputy governor are nominated and appointed by the president, with approval from the [[People's Representative Council|DPR]]. Deputy governors are nominated by the governor and appointed by the president, with approval of the DPR. The president has no power to dismiss a member of the board, except when a board member voluntarily resigns, is permanently handicapped, or is proven guilty of criminal offence. The senior deputy governor acts as governor in the case of the latter's office vacancy.

The Board of Governors Meeting is the bank's highest decision-making forum. It is held at least once a month to decide on general policy on monetary affairs, and at least once a week to evaluate policy implementation or to decide on other strategic and principle policy.

The Bank is active in promoting [[financial inclusion]] policy and is a leading member of the [http://www.afi-global.org Alliance for Financial Inclusion]. It hosted AFI's second annual Global Policy Forum (GPF) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120220161822/http://www.afi-global.org/gpf/gpf-2010] in Bali, Indonesia in 2010. On 14 May 2012 Bank Indonesia announced it would be making specific commitments to financial inclusion under the [[The Maya Declaration#Additional Commitment Pledges|Maya Declaration]].

By 30 December 2013, the bank's microprudential supervision functions will be transferred to [[Financial Services Authority (Indonesia)|Financial Services Authority]] (OJK). In the future, the bank will maintain Indonesian financial system and monetary stability through mixture of monetary and macroprudential instruments and policies. In the future, the bank will maintain Indonesian financial system and monetary stability through mixture of monetary and macroprudential instruments and policies.

'''Bank Indonesia Liquidity Support''' is an [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] policy that was formulated with Bank Indonesia in the crisis period and executed by Bank Indonesia to rescue the [[monetary]] and [[banking system]] as well as the [[Economy of Indonesia|economy]] as a whole. It was partly based on the instruction and command of the [[President of Indonesia|President]] in the limited meeting of economic, finance, and development supervision and production and distribution on 3 September 1997.

This policy was provided under various emergency lending schemes (Fasilitas Diskonto I/Fasdis I, Fasdis II, Fasilitas SBPU, Fasilitas SBPUK, Fasilitas Diskonto Baru and Dana Talangan).

==Offices==
BI operates 37 offices across Indonesia, and five representative offices in [[New York City]], [[London]], [[Tokyo]], [[Singapore]] and [[Beijing]].
