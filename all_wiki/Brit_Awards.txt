The '''BRIT Awards''' (often simply called The '''BRITs''') are the [[British Phonographic Industry]]'s annual [[popular music]] awards. The name was originally a shortened form of "British", "Britain", or "Britannia" (in the early days the awards were sponsored by [[Britannia Music Club]]), but subsequently became a [[backronym]] for '''British Record Industry Trusts Show'''.<ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/press-area/news-amp3b-press-release/article/brits-duo-on-track-to-reach-dizzee-ing-heights-in-uk-charts.aspx BRITs Duo On Track To Reach Dizzee-ing Heights in UK Charts] ''British Recorded Music Industry''  Retrieved 28 April 2011</ref> In addition, an equivalent awards ceremony for classical music, called the [[Classic Brit Awards|Classic BRIT Awards]], is held in the month of May. [[Robbie Williams]] holds the record for the most BRIT Awards, 13 as a [[solo artist]] and another five as part of [[Take That]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/events/brits/photos/hall-of-fame/|title=BRITs Hall Of Fame: The 20 Biggest BRIT Awards Winners In History|website=Capital|language=en|access-date=2019-03-01}}</ref>

The awards were first held in 1977 and originated as an annual event in 1982 under the auspices of the British record industry's trade association, the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]].

The first awards ceremony was in 1977, as "The BRITish Record Industry BRITannia Awards", to mark the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]] and was televised by [[Thames Television]]. There has been an annual ceremony since 1982.

The 1988 BPI Awards was the first of the ceremonies to be broadcast on [[live television]]. The [[BBC]] had previously broadcast the ceremony from 1985, with the shows from 1982 to 1984 not broadcast on television. The BBC continued to broadcast the renamed BRIT Awards, live in 1989 and pre-recorded from 1990 to 1992. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] have broadcast the awards since 1993, pre-recorded until 2006 and live from 2007 onwards.<ref name="Brits Live"/> [[BBC Radio 1]] has provided backstage radio coverage since 2008.

Since 2014, ITV have aired a launch show in January called ''The BRITs Are Coming'', which reveals some of the artists who have been nominated at the upcoming ceremony. The first host was [[Nick Grimshaw]], followed by [[Reggie Yates]] (2015) and [[Laura Whitmore]] in 2016. [[Emma Willis]] has hosted the show in 2017 and again in 2018, which was broadcast live for the first time. [[Clara Amfo]] hosted the 2019 launch show. [[Alice Levine]] hosted the 2020 launch show.

==Notable moments==

===Electricians' strike (1987)===
In 1987 the BPI Awards ceremony was held in the Great Room at the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]]. At the time there was a BBC electricians' strike in effect, and the organisers decided to use a non-TV events production company, called Upfront, to manage the show. Despite the show being picketed, the event was transmitted as intended. For a while, the outdoor broadcast scanner was rocked on its wheels by the protesters and they managed to shut off the power to one of the big GE video screen projectors. Upfront was then asked to organise the following year and persuaded the BPI to move the event to a larger venue, starting the trend that continues to this day, albeit at The O2, and with a different production company (MJK Productions).

===Samantha Fox and Mick Fleetwood (1989)===

In 1989, the ceremony was broadcast live and presented by [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s [[Mick Fleetwood]] and singer [[Samantha Fox]]. The inexperience of the hosts, an ineffective autocue, and little preparation combined to create an unprofessional show that was poorly received. The hosts continually got their lines mixed up, a pre-recorded message from [[Michael Jackson]] was never transmitted and several guest stars arrived late on stage or even at the wrong time, such as [[Boy George]] in place of [[The Four Tops]].

===Freddie Mercury's final public appearance (1990)===
The 1990 awards ceremony saw the last public appearance of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] frontman [[Freddie Mercury]].<ref name="queen">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/events/brit_awards/freddy.htm The Highs and Lows of the Brit Awards] ''BBC News'' Retrieved 28 April 2011</ref> Queen appeared at the ceremony to receive the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.<ref name="queen"/><ref>[http://www.brits.co.uk/photo/queen-freddie-mercury-roger-taylor-brian-may-brits-1990 Queen, Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor, Brian May, BRITS 1990] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118123708/http://www.brits.co.uk/photo/queen-freddie-mercury-roger-taylor-brian-may-brits-1990 |date=18 January 2014 }} ''BRIT Awards.co.uk'' Retrieved 28 April 2011</ref> Mercury (who had been suffering from AIDS since 1987 but had not disclosed it to the public) did not make a speech, as [[Brian May]] did the talking on behalf of the other members, but his gaunt appearance was noticeable.<ref name="Moments">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26226117 "Brit Awards: A dozen lesser-known moments"]. BBC News. Retrieved 3 February 2015</ref>

===The KLF (1992)===

In 1992, dance/art band [[The KLF]] was awarded Best British Group (shared with [[Simply Red]]) and were booked to open the show. In an attempt to hijack the event, the duo collaborated with [[grindcore|grindcore metal]] band [[Extreme Noise Terror]] to perform a [[3 a.m. Eternal#The KLF vs Extreme Noise Terror|death metal version of the dance song]] "[[3 a.m. Eternal]]", a performance that prompted conductor [[Georg Solti|Sir Georg Solti]] to walk out in disgust.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://microsites.nme.com/rock100/site/4.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417214917/http://microsites.nme.com/rock100/site/4.html |archive-date=17 April 2006|title=4.

===Michael Jackson and Jarvis Cocker (1996)===
In 1996, [[Michael Jackson]] was given a special Artist of a Generation award. At the ceremony he accompanied his single "[[Earth Song]]" with a stage show, culminating with Jackson as a 'Christ-like figure' surrounded by children. [[Jarvis Cocker]], of the band [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], mounted the stage in what he would later claim as a protest at this portion of the performance. Cocker ran across the stage, lifting his shirt and pointing his (clothed) backside in Jackson's direction. Cocker was subsequently questioned by the police on suspicion of causing injury towards three of the children in Jackson's performance, who were now on stage.

Regarding his actions, Cocker said, "My actions were a form of protest at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing. I just ran on the stage. I didn't make any contact with anyone as far as I recall."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlp.cz/space/opatrilp/Pulp/the_Brits_96.html |title=Jarvis' stage invasion at the 1996 Brits |publisher=Mlp.cz |access-date=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221215457/http://www.mlp.cz/space/opatrilp/Pulp/the_Brits_96.html |archive-date=21 February 2009 }}</ref>

===Oasis and Blur rivalry (1996)===
1996 saw the height of a well-documented feud between [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and fellow Britpop band [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. The differing styles of the bands, coupled with their prominence within the [[Britpop]] movement, led the British media to seize upon the rivalry between the bands.<ref name="behaviour">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pop-and-the-art-of-bad-behaviour-1320055.html "Pop and the art of bad behaviour"]. The Independent. Retrieved 4 February 2015</ref> Both factions played along, with the Gallaghers taunting Blur at the 1996 BRIT Awards by singing a rendition of "[[Parklife (song)|Parklife]]" when they collected their "Best British Band" award (with [[Liam Gallagher|Liam]] changing the lyrics to "Shite-life" and [[Noel Gallagher|Noel]] changing them to "[[Marmite]]").<ref name="edge"/>

===Chumbawamba and John Prescott (1998)===
In 1998, [[Danbert Nobacon]] of the politically active band [[Chumbawamba]] threw a bucket of iced water over then-[[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]]. Despite apologies on behalf of the band from EMI Europe, Chumbawamba were unrepentant saying "If John Prescott has the nerve to turn up at events like the Brit Awards in a vain attempt to make Labour seem cool and trendy, then he deserves all we can throw at him."

===Belle and Sebastian (1999)===
In 1999, the Indie band [[Belle & Sebastian]] were nominated for Best British Newcomers, despite having released three albums before the 1999 Awards. The award was sponsored by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio One]] and voted for online by their listeners. At the time, [[Steps (group)|Steps]] were arguably Britain's biggest boy/girl pop group and were also nominated. Despite this, the award was won by Belle & Sebastian. On the Saturday after the awards, a story appeared in the press alleging that the group had rigged the vote in their favour, encouraging students from two universities to vote online. However, fans argued that the band had a predominantly large student following, that band member Isobel Campbell had attended one of the universities in question, and in particular, the award ought to be given on artistic merit as opposed to popularity or CD sales.

===Ronnie Wood and Brandon Block confrontation (2000)===

Dance DJ [[Brandon Block]] was told by his friends that he had won an award and had been summoned to the stage to collect it. Because of his advanced state of intoxication, he believed them and walked on to the stage, eventually ending up next to a bemused [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]] and actress [[Thora Birch]], who were about to present the award for Best Soundtrack Album. After Block was removed from the stage by security, Wood aimed an insult in his direction. A series of insults were then traded between the two, both of which were audible through the stage microphone, causing claims that the whole event may have been staged. Wood then threw his drink into Block's face, and the DJ was ejected from the event. Sometime after the incident, Block claimed that he had subsequently apologised to Wood for his behaviour, and Wood had merely brushed it off.

===Geri Halliwell vs. the Spice Girls (2000)===
The [[Spice Girls]] were set to receive the Outstanding Contribution To Music award at the 2000 BRIT Awards. There was much media speculation before and even during the event as to whether or not former Ginger Spice, [[Geri Halliwell]] would accept the award with the four remaining members of the group.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/04/fiachragibbons | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Spice whirl casts shadow over Brit awards | first=Fiachra | last=Gibbons | date=4 March 2010 | access-date=27 April 2010}}</ref> On the night, however, Halliwell declined to join her former bandmates and instead ensured front-page coverage the following day by performing her solo number 1 single "[[Bag It Up]]" straddling a pole between a pair of giant inflatable legs.

===Russell Brand (2007)===
Some controversy was caused by the host of the 2007 awards ceremony, comedian [[Russell Brand]], who made several quips relating to news stories of the time including [[Robbie Williams]] entering [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] for addiction to [[prescription drugs]], the Queen's 'naughty bits' and a fatal [[190th Fighter Squadron, Blues and Royals friendly fire incident|friendly fire incident]] involving a British soldier killed by American armed forces in Iraq. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] received over 300 complaint calls from viewers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6365325.stm|title=Viewers complain over Brits jokes|publisher=BBC News|date=15 February 2007|access-date=23 February 2008}}</ref> He would again instigate controversy the following year at the [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards]].

===Vic Reeves and Sharon Osbourne (2008)===
After [[Vic Reeves]] appeared to forget which award he was presenting, [[Sharon Osbourne]] attempted to wrestle the microphone from him, insisted he was drunk and called him a "pissed bastard". She proceeded to make the full announcement herself. The next day it was reported that Reeves was not intoxicated and was hurt by Osbourne's behaviour. The incident has since been ascribed to an autocue malfunction, but Reeves said in his defence that he was trying to read the autocue screen, but he couldn't read it because Osbourne was pushing him out of the way.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Adele speech cut short (2012)===
Adele won the award for 'British Album of the Year', widely regarded as the most important award. Less than half a minute into her acceptance speech, host [[James Corden]] was forced to cut Adele off in order to introduce [[Blur (band)|Blur]] who were due to perform an eleven-minute set as they had won the 'Outstanding Contribution to Music' award and the ceremony was running over its allotted time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a366805/blur-to-play-for-record-time-at-brits-2012-says-james-corden.html |title=Blur to play for record time at Brits 2012, says James Corden |work=Digital Spy |date=20 February 2012 }}</ref> Adele was visibly annoyed and proceeded to raise her middle finger<ref>{{cite web |author=Ellie |url=http://uk.omg.yahoo.com/gossip/110--pop/brits-2012-adele-wins-best-album-gets-cut-215742669.html |title=BRITs 2012: Adele wins Best Album, gets cut off mid-speech.

===Damon Albarn's slurred anti-Brexit speech and Jack Whitehall's response (2018)===
When picking up the [[Brit Award for British Group|Best British Group]] award for [[Gorillaz]], Albarn appeared to be drunk in his speech, slurring his words and starting a rant about [[Brexit]]. Taking the microphone while his bandmates hung back, he began: "This country is, believe it or not, quite a small little thing right. "It's a lovely place and it's part of a beautiful world but don’t let it become isolated and don't let yourselves become cut off." The speech appeared to go on for a while and at one point, the camera cut back to [[Jack Whitehall]], who was supposed to continue presenting although it quickly went back to the speech as Albarn carried on speaking. Once the speech was over, Whitehall responded by saying, "I really didn’t want this to be an [[Adele]] moment" referring back to 2012 when Adele was cut off and swore at the audience.

===British Video of the Year controversy (2018)===
The 2018 ceremony garnered controversy when [[Harry Styles]] was announced as the winner of the [[Brit Award for British Video of the Year|British Video of the Year]]. The official Brits leaderboard for these votes showed [[Little Mix]] consistently maintaining the number one spot each week, followed by Styles at number two. During the final voting event on the night of the ceremony Little Mix and Styles alternated between the top spot on numerous occasions. The last leaderboard update placed Little Mix at the top spot, with Styles at number two. After the announcement of Styles as a winner, the Brit Awards were accused by Little Mix fans of [[Rigging election|rigging]] the votes for this category.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/little-mix/news/brits-2018-little-mix-fans-confused-after-touch-loses-video-of-the-year|title=BRITS 2018: Little Mix Fans Confused After 'Touch' Loses Video of the Year|publisher=MTV UK|access-date=23 February 2018|language=en}}</ref> The Brits responded to the claim, saying: "The final leaderboard was displayed on The BRITs website prior to the final count being checked and verified independently by the [[Electoral Reform Services]], the company that independently run all BRITs voting processes. The leaderboard doesn’t work in real time and the vote was incredibly tight at the top. Fans can have complete confidence in the BRITs public vote."

We are confident that the vote integrity has not been compromised".{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

=== Dave's performance (2020) ===
Rapper and classically-trained pianist [[Dave (rapper)|Santan Dave]], who won [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] for ''[[Psychodrama (album)|Pyschodrama]]'', performed his song "[[Psychodrama (album)|Black]]" while playing the piano onstage. Halfway through, he was accompanied by his producer [[Fraser T. Smith]], also playing the piano. Dave added an additional verse at the end, calling Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] "a real racist", and referencing the [[Windrush scandal]] and the [[Grenfell Tower fire]] by finishing his performance with: "We want rehabilitation, now that would be amazing, but Grenfell victims still need accommodation, And we still need support for the Windrush Generation, Reparations for the time our people spent on plantations." In addition, he paid tribute to victims of the [[2019 London Bridge stabbing|London Bridge Attack]], including [[Jack Merrit]], who had worked with Dave's jailed older brother in prison rehabilition. The performance garnered much media attention, with many praising it for its message for racial equality, calling it "the best political speech ... of the decade". However, it also was subject to 257 of the 307 [[Ofcom]] complaints made that night, due to its political nature.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dave's performance at BRIT Awards gets more than 200 OfCom complaints |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/brit-awards-200-ofcom-complaints-dave-performance-black-2616095|first=Charlotte|last=Krol|date=28 February 2020|website=NME}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last= Iqbal|first=Nosheen|date=23 February 2020|title='It was so emotional':The duo who helped rapper Dave stun the Brits |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/23/how-rapper-dave-blew-away-brit-awards}}</ref>
