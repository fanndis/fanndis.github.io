{{PoliticsUK}}

The '''Cabinet Office''' is a [[British government departments|department]] of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] responsible for supporting the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]].<ref>This should be distinguished from the Prime Minister's personal staff who form the [[10 Downing Street|Prime Minister's Office]].</ref> It is composed of various units that support [[United Kingdom cabinet committee|Cabinet committees]] and which co-ordinate the delivery of government objectives via other departments. It currently has just under 8,000 staff, some of whom work in [[Whitehall]]. Staff working in the [[British Prime Minister's Office|Prime Minister's Office]] are part of the Cabinet Office.

==Responsibilities==
The Cabinet Office's core functions are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office/about|title=Cabinet Office, About Us|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>
* Supporting collective government, helping to ensure the effective development, coordination and implementation of policy;
* Supporting the National Security Council and the Joint Intelligence Organisation, coordinating the government's response to crises and managing the UK's cyber security;
* Promoting efficiency and reform across government through innovation, transparency, better procurement and project management, by transforming the delivery of services, and improving the capability of the Civil Service;
* Political and constitutional reform.

The Cabinet Office has responsibility for the following at a [[United Kingdom|UK]] national level:
* the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Home Civil Service]]
* the [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commissions]]
* the [[Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority]]
* the Government [[Commercial management|Commercial]] Function<ref>[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/711988/Rich_Picture.jpg Government Commercial Function: Looking to the Future], accessed 5 May 2019</ref> and the Government Commercial Organisation.<ref>Government Commercial Function, [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-commercial-organisation Government Commercial Organisation], published 5 June 2018, accessed 5 May 2019</ref>
* the Government digital, data and technology (DDaT) function through the [[Government Digital Service]]<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-data-and-technology-functional-standard-version-1#digital-data-and-technology Government Functional Standard GovS 005: Digital, Data and Technology], published 2 July 2020, accessed 26 Nov 2020</ref>

==History==
The department was formed in December 1916 from the secretariat of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Research_Guide:_Cabinet_Office_Records|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130224163755/http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Research_Guide:_Cabinet_Office_Records|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 February 2013|title=Research Guide: Cabinet Office Records - Your Archives|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|access-date=3 July 2007}}</ref> under [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Sir Maurice Hankey]], the first [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]].

Traditionally the most important part of the Cabinet Office's role was facilitating [[collective responsibility|collective decision-making]] by the Cabinet, through running and supporting Cabinet-level committees. This is still its principal role, but since the absorption of some of the functions of [[Civil Service Department|the Civil Service Department]] in 1981 the Cabinet Office has also helped to ensure that a wide range of Ministerial priorities are taken forward across Whitehall.

It also contains miscellaneous units that do not sit well in other departments. For example:
* The Historical Section was founded in 1906 as part of the Committee for Imperial Defence and is concerned with [[Official history|Official Histories]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=3&CATID=2377&SearchInit=4&SearchType=6&CATREF=CAB+103|title=National Archive Series reference CAB 103|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>
* The [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] was founded in 1936 and transferred to the department in 1957. It deals with intelligence assessments and directing the national intelligence organisations of the UK.
* The Ceremonial Branch was founded in 1937 and transferred to the department in 1981. It was originally concerned with all ceremonial functions of state, but today it handles [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] and appointments.

In modern times the Cabinet Office often takes on responsibility for areas of policy which are the priority of the Government of the time. The units that administer these areas migrate in and out of the Cabinet Office as government priorities (and governments) change.

==Committees==

Cabinet committees have two key purposes:<ref name="CO report">{{Cite document |title=A Guide to Cabinet and Cabinet Committee Business |year=2008 |pages=44 |place=London |publisher=Cabinet Office |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/98307/guide_to_cabinet.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327071925/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/98307/guide_to_cabinet.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009}}</ref>
* To relieve the burden on the Cabinet by dealing with business that does not need to be discussed at full Cabinet. Appeals to the Cabinet should be infrequent, and Ministers chairing Cabinet Committees should exercise discretion in advising the Prime Minister whether to allow them.
* To support the principle of collective responsibility by ensuring that, even though a question may never reach the Cabinet itself, it will be fully considered. In this way, the final judgement is sufficiently authoritative that Government as a whole can be expected to accept responsibility for it. In this sense, Cabinet Committee decisions have the same authority as Cabinet decisions.

==Buildings==
[[File:Cabinet Office (29542331802).jpg|thumb|right|Cabinet Office, [[Whitehall]], [[London]]]]
[[File:Cabinet Office, Whitehall, London, UK - 20130629-02.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to the Cabinet Office.]]
The main building of the Cabinet Office is at '''70 [[Whitehall]]''', adjacent to [[Downing Street]]. The building connects three historically distinct properties, as well as the remains of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] 1530 [[tennis court]]s, part of the [[Palace of Whitehall]], which can be seen within the building. The Whitehall frontage was designed by [[John Soane|Sir John Soane]] and completed by [[Charles Barry|Sir Charles Barry]] between 1845 and 1847 as the Treasury Buildings. Immediately to the west Dorset House (1700) connects the front of the building to William Kent's Treasury (1733–36), which faces out onto Horse Guards Parade. The latter is built over the site of the Cockpit, used for [[cock fight]]ing in the Tudor period, and subsequently as a [[Cockpit-in-Court|theatre]]. In the early 1960s the buildings were restored and many of the Tudor remains were exposed and repaired. Significant renovations between 2010 and 2016 converted many of the floors to open plan and created new office space. The [[Cabinet Office Briefing Room]]s are located on this site.

The department occupies other buildings in Whitehall and the surrounding area, including part of 1 Horse Guards, as well as sites in other parts of the country.
