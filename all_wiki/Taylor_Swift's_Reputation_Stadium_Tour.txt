'''Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour'''<ref name="tour">{{cite web|url=https://taylorswift.com/events|title=Events|date=November 13, 2017|accessdate=November 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129111407/https://taylorswift.com/events|archive-date=November 29, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> was the fifth [[concert tour]] and first all-stadium tour by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], in support of her sixth studio album, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The tour began on May 8, 2018, in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]] and concluded on November 21, 2018, in Tokyo, comprising 53 concerts. The tour received 2.55&nbsp;million attendees and grossed $345.7&nbsp;million in revenue, becoming Swift's most successful tour to-date, the third highest grossing female concert tour of all time, and the highest-grossing concert tour in United States and North American history.

The tour received universal acclaim from critics, who commonly labelled it as the best tour of 2018 and Swift's best tour yet. It further went on to win many "Tour of the Year" accolades. The October 6 show at [[AT&T Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]], was recorded and released as a [[Netflix]]-original [[concert film]] of the same name, on December 31, to critical acclaim.

He also described the tour as "an oversized, high-tech touring Broadway production with a mostly tremendous soundtrack" and concluded that "when discussing the biggest artists of her [Swift's] generation, she's undeniably on the shortlist" and that the singer has ascended to the same "rarefied" tier as the "classic rock deities who've echoed across this venue [''[[Ohio stadium|the Horseshoe]]''] before her, able to keep commanding stadium status for the rest of her career".<ref name="Stereogum">{{cite news|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2005090/taylor-swift-reputation-tour-review-columbus/franchises/the-week-in-pop/|title=Big Reputation: A Trip To Taylor Swift's Hyper-Maximalist Stadium Tour|last=DeVille|first=Chris|magazine=[[Stereogum]]|access-date=December 22, 2019}}</ref> [[Rob Sheffield]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named the tour as Swift's "most astounding tour yet" and complimented it for giving "it all the vibe of a mass communion" despite aiming for "maximum [[Stadium Rock|stadium-rock]] razzle-dazzle bombast".

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Bob Gordon thought that "[[...Ready for It?]]" is "an appropriate and compelling opener".

Commenting on the set-list, she noted that Swift "had the crowd aching for more with the commencement of every song, thanks to seamless transitions". Burgham highlighted the intimacy of Swift's acoustic guitar and piano performances that proved Swift remaining "integral to her singer-songwriter origins". She summarized her review by stating that "there may not be an artist in this lifetime who quite manages to connect to thousands of people on a rainy night as well as Taylor Swift can – and that's the reputation she will be remembered for".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/music/10-11-2018/taylor-swift-reviewed-despite-the-snakes-her-reputation-shines-on/|title=Taylor Swift in Auckland, reviewed: Despite the snakes, her Reputation shines on|last=Burgham|first=Lydia|date=November 10, 2018|magazine=[[The Spinoff]]|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref>

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Chris Willman wrote that the show "had plenty of fierceness, especially in the early going" but also the "pre-decedent Taylor on the line… the guileless Swift we remember from two or three skins ago", and commended Swift for using her two hours on the stage to "paint a rewardingly holistic picture". Willman believed that, despite the huge production, "we're still left not so much with dragons or defensiveness but in the endearingly earnest presence of pop's most approachable superstar". He further remarked that the acoustic performance of "Dancing With Our Hands Tied" proved that ''Reputation'' worked acoustically as well, without the "[[Max Martin]]-izing".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Willman |first1=Chris |title=Taylor Swift’s ‘Reputation’ Tour Has Bad Blood, Good Will, Sex Appeal and Serpents |url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/taylor-swift-reputation-stadium-tour-review-1202812123/ |website=Variety |accessdate=December 22, 2019 |language=en |date=May 16, 2018}}</ref> Randy Lewis of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that Swift gave "a master class in the constructive use of the modern technology that's allowed her to establish and nurture an exceptionally powerful connection with a massive audience". He underlined the use of [[PixMob|light-up bracelets]] that allowed the attendees "to feel like participants, even collaborators, rather than passive observers" and appreciated the stage's resemblance to "a skyscraper in progress, with six [[Crane (machine)|crane]]-like contraptions stretching up above a wedge-like screen". Lewis summarized the show as "tightly structured for the most part, featuring elaborate production numbers that rely on video projection, eye-popping lighting and [[pyrotechnics]], choreography and precisely coordinated interaction among the star, band, singers and dancers".<ref name="LATimes"/>

Reviewing for [[V (American magazine)|''V'' Magazine]], Greg Krelenstein stated that Swift possesses "a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting", with the new persona the singer adopted on ''Reputation'' album cycle suiting itself "excellently to a show of this magnitude where she appears larger than life". He thought that Swift fully embraced her vast back catalog and praised her command of the stage—"whether plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers" that showed that Swift's musical and performance evolution is an "absolute success". Krelenstein concluded that the pop star "delivers in every way to a mesmerized and devoted audience, re-defining what the modern stadium tour can be".<ref name="VMagazine"/> Ed Masley, from ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', wrote that "there were many moments in the course Swift's performance that felt like she was playing to the back rows of the stadium by simply sharing with her fans", while complimenting the tour's production and Swift's connection with the crowd.<ref>{{cite newspaper|last=Masley |first=Ed |date=May 9, 2018 |title=Taylor Swift 'Reputation' tour launch: Star shows stadium she's ready for it|url=https://www.azcentral.com/amp/584934002|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic|AZ Central]] |accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref> Jim Harrington of ''[[The Mercury News]]'' asserted that the singer's vocal work and performance skills have improved over the years, and added that "her game is well-rounded enough that she can excel equally at every different aspect of the show."<ref>{{cite newspaper |last=Harrington |first=Jim |date=May 12, 2018 |title=Review: Taylor Swift delivers a near-perfect pop show in Bay Area |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/11/review-taylor-swift-delivers-near-perfect-pop-show-in-bay-area/amp/ |newspaper=[[The Mercury News]] |accessdate=May 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512105422/https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/11/review-taylor-swift-delivers-near-perfect-pop-show-in-bay-area/amp/ |archive-date=May 12, 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Chris Tuite, from ''[[KPIX-TV|CBS San Francisco]]'', wrote: "The only thing more prominent than the singer herself during her current costume-change filled spectacle are the massive, vicious looking snakes that symbolically appear throughout the set."<ref>{{cite newspaper |last=Tuite |first=Chris |date=May 13, 2018 |title=Taylor Swift Delivers Pop Spectacle At Levi's Stadium |url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/05/13/taylor-swift-delivers-pop-spectacle-at-levis-stadium/ |newspaper=[[KPIX-TV|CBS San Francisco]] |accessdate=May 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514103134/http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/05/13/taylor-swift-delivers-pop-spectacle-at-levis-stadium/ |archive-date=May 14, 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Michael Tritsch from ''303 Magazine'' raved that the tour "broke new ground and set the bar high for future stadium tours", burning "its way into the history books".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Tritsch |first=Michael |date=May 27, 2018 |title=Review – Taylor Swift proved her reputation is worth all the buzz in Denver|url=https://303magazine.com/2018/05/taylor-swift-sports-authority-field-mile-high/|newspaper=303 Magazine|accessdate=May 28, 2018}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
The film received widespread critical acclaim upon release, with many critics labeling the film as "immortalizing" and "unforgettable". The commentators praised the camerawork from director Paul Dugdale for documenting Swift's "stardom", the crowd's emotions and the production involved in the concert. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Rob Sheffield wrote that the film "immortalizes her best tour yet" and that the film shows off "the stadium-rocking spectacle without toning down any of her songs' one-on-one emotional intimacy".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/taylor-swift-reputation-movie-netflix-773838/|title=Taylor Swift's 'Reputation' Film Shows Why She's One of the All-Time Greats|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=December 31, 2018|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> Describing the Netflix special as "the end of an era", Amanda Petrusich of ''[[The New Yorker]]''  opined that the film "will soon either be regarded as a museum piece or as a testament to Swift's era-defying longevity".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/taylor-swifts-netflix-special-is-the-end-of-an-era|title=Taylor Swift's Netflix Special Is the End of an Era|last=Petrusich|first=Amanda|date=January 3, 2019|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> 

''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Denis Warner stated that the film "illuminates the singer's power, dedication, and strength as an artist". He further stated that the film "allows you to get more of a feel of the singer as a performer – and experience just how delicately everything is staged" and appreciated Swift for giving "a gorgeous look into her [Swift's] world as one of today's greatest entertainers".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8491764/taylor-swift-reputation-tour-netflix-doc-review|title=Taylor Swift Knows All Too Well How to Put on a Masterful Performance: Netflix Doc Review|last=Denis|first=Warner|date=December 31, 2018|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> ''[[The New York Post|Decider]]''{{'}}s Benjamin Smith called the film as an "intimate document of an impersonal event". He further expanded that Swift "will stand the test of time more than her fellow early 21st century pop queens", stating the reason "Taylor Swift is perhaps the only who has figured out a way to turn her music into something more than mere pop".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://decider.com/2019/01/04/taylor-swift-reputation-stadium-tour-netflix-review/|title='Taylor Swift Reputation Stadium Tour' Is An Intimate Document Of An Impersonal Event|last=Smitb|first=Benjamin|date=January 4, 2019|magazine=[[New York Post|Decider]]|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> Complimenting Swift's connection with her fans, Nardin Saad of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that "the 10-time Grammy-winner's star power is tantamount as evidenced" in the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-taylor-swift-reputation-netflix-20181231-story.html|title=Taylor Swift's Netflix special gives fans a reason to stay in on New Year's Eve|last=Saad|first=Nadin|date=December 31, 2018|magazine=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> 

Katie Collins of ''[[CNET]]'' opined that the film "serves as a reminder that no matter what else happens, Swift's stardom is perennial" and praised the film for "the divine showcase of the costumes, the dancing and especially Swift's own barely-contained effervescent joy at being on stage". She further complimented the camerawork, stating "closeups brought new insights" into the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/taylor-swift-reputation-tour-movie-review-netflix-immortalises-the-music-event-of-the-year/|title=Taylor Swift's Reputation tour lives forever and ever on Netflix|last=Collins|first=Katie|date=January 1, 2019|magazine=[[CNET]]|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> Nicholas Hautman of ''[[Us Weekly]]'' appreciated the camerawork for depicting "the fans hysterically crying and screaming in support of their idol".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/taylor-swifts-netflix-special-is-unforgettable-review/|title=Taylor Swift's 'Reputation' Netflix Special Is an 'Unforgettable' New Year's Eve Gift: Review|last=Hautman|first=Nicholas|date=December 31, 2018|magazine=[[Us Weekly]]|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Uproxx]]'', Chloe Gilke labelled the film as a "masterful documentation of the magical energy at a pop show" and as "a love letter to the audience at her shows, and to her fans", while stating that the film "honors the sacred joy of her [Swift's] performance that night, and the people who made it happen". She lauded the camerawork for capturing "the massive scope of the production from every angle" and the audio which "is crystal-clear and beautiful, with the crowd quieted down so viewers at home can hear Swift best".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://uproxx.com/music/taylor-swift-reputation-tour-documentary-review/|title=Taylor Swift's 'Reputation' Tour Documentary Is A Tribute To The Massive Joy Of Pop Concerts|last=Gilke|first=Chloe|date=January 8, 2019|magazine=[[Uproxx]]|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref>
