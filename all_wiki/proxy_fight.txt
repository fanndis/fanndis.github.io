{{distinguish|proxy war}}
A '''proxy fight''', '''proxy contest''' or '''proxy battle''' (sometimes even called a '''[[proxy war]]''') is an unfriendly contest for the control over an organization. The event usually occurs when a corporation's stockholders develop opposition to some aspect of the corporate governance, often focusing on directorial and management positions. Corporate activists may attempt to persuade shareholders to use their [[Proxy voting|proxy votes]] (i.e., votes by one individual or institution as the authorized representative of another) to install new management for any of a variety of reasons. Shareholders of a public corporation may appoint an [[Proxy firm|agent]] to attend shareholder meetings and vote on their behalf. That agent is the shareholder's proxy.<ref>Klein, Ramseyer, and Bainbridge. Business Associations: Cases and Materials on Agency, Partnerships, and Corporations. (7th Ed.) Foundation Press.</ref>

In a proxy fight, [[Incumbent#In business|incumbent]] directors and management have the odds stacked in their favor over those trying to force the corporate change.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Webber |first1=David H. |authorlink=David H.

As a result, most proxy fights are unsuccessful; except those waged more recently by [[hedge fund]]s, which are successful more than 60% of the time.<ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01432.x/full.html Klein, April and Zur, Emanuel. 2009.

==Examples==
*An acquiring company, frustrated by the [[Takeover#Tactics against hostile takeover|takeover defense]]s of the management, may initiate a proxy fight to install a more compliant management of the target.
*An early history of proxy fighting, detailing such 1950s battles as the fight for control of some of U.S. largest corporations, including the [[Bank of America]] and the [[New York Central Railroad]], can be found in [[David Karr]]'s 1956 volume, ''Fight for Control''.
*Stockholder dissidents opposed to an impending takeover in the view that it will dilute value may also use a proxy fight to stop it. An example of a proxy fight took place within [[Hewlett-Packard]], when the management of that company sought to take over [[Compaq]]. Opponents of the Compaq takeover lost the fight. The management, under [[Carly Fiorina]], remained in place, and the merger went ahead.<ref>[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/03/20/fin_hp_declares_proxy.html HP declares proxy win]</ref>
*In the absence of any looming takeover, proxy fights can come about because dissidents are unhappy with management, as with [[Carl Icahn]]'s effort in 2005–2006 to oust a majority of the board of [[Time Warner]].<ref>[http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2006/01/31/frank-biondi-joins-carl-icahn-in-time-warner-proxy-fight Frank Biondi Joins Carl Icahn in Time Warner Proxy Fight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218183834/http://dmwmedia.com/news/2006/01/31/frank-biondi-joins-carl-icahn-in-time-warner-proxy-fight |date=2010-02-18 }}</ref>

==Key players==
Due to their out-sized influence with many institutional investors, [[proxy advisor]]s play a key role in many proxy fights. In many cases, the proxy firms end up determining the result of the contest.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/protecting-shareholders-from-activist-proxies-1432860067 Protecting Shareholders From Activist Proxies HP declares proxy win]</ref> The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 also gave the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) the power to regulate the solicitation of proxies.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Hirst|first=Scott|date=2018-04-01|title=Universal Proxies|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/344|journal=The Harvard Law School Program on Corporate Governance Discussion Paper|volume=No. 2016-11}}</ref>'''{{rp|4}}''' Some of the rules the SEC has since proposed, like the universal proxy, have been controversial because opponents have suggested that they would increase the amount of proxy fights.<ref name=":1" />'''{{rp|61}}'''
