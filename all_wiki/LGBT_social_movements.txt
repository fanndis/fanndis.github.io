{{LGBT sidebar|history}}
'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ('''LGBT''') '''social movements''' are [[social movements]] that advocate for [[LGBT]] people in society. Social movements may focus on equal rights, such as the 2000s movement for same-sex marriage, or they may focus on liberation, as in the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Earlier movements focused on self-help and self-acceptance, such as the homophile movement of the 1950s. Although there is not a primary or an overarching central organization that represents all LGBT people and their interests, numerous [[List of LGBT rights organizations|LGBT rights organizations]] are active worldwide. The earliest organizations to support LGBT rights were formed in the early 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/19/us/lgbt-rights-milestones-fast-facts/index.html|title=LGBT Rights Milestones Fast Facts|last=Library|first=C.

A commonly stated goal among these movements is [[social equality]] for LGBT people, but there is still denial of full LGBT rights.<ref>{{cite journal |id={{ProQuest|1038962171}} |last1=Rhoades |first1=Mindi |year=2011 |title=Disrupting discourses digitally for LGBT rights |journal=Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education |volume=29 |pages=47–64 }}</ref> Some have also focused on building LGBT communities or worked towards liberation for the broader society from [[biphobia]], [[homophobia]], and [[transphobia]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yedGAAAAMAAJ&q=%22sexual%2Boppression%22%2B%22it+lies+at+the+roots+of+the+oppression+of+LGBT+people+as+well%22|title=Actors to Gyms|access-date=7 June 2015|isbn=978-0-684-31262-0|last1=Stein|first1=Marc|date=2004-11-30}}</ref> There is a struggle for LGBT rights today.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=John A. |last2=Moe |first2=Edward |title=Nationalism and the Struggle for LGBTQ Rights in Serbia, 1991–2014 |journal=Problems of Post-Communism |date=3 September 2015 |volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=273–286 |doi=10.1080/10758216.2015.1041840 |s2cid=143188655 }}</ref> LGBT movements organized today are made up of a wide range of [[activism|political activism]] and cultural activity, including [[lobbying]], [[Demonstration (people)|street marches]], [[social group]]s, [[media (communication)|media]], [[art]], and [[academic research|research]].

Sociologist Mary Bernstein writes: "For the lesbian and gay movement, then, cultural goals include (but are not limited to) challenging dominant constructions of [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]], [[homophobia]], and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual [[nuclear family]] ([[heteronormativity]]). Political goals include changing laws and policies in order to gain new [[rights]], benefits, and protections from harm."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Mary |title=Identities and Politics: Toward a Historical Understanding of the Lesbian and Gay Movement |journal=Social Science History |date=2002 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=531–581 |jstor=40267789 |doi=10.1017/S0145553200013080 }}</ref> Bernstein emphasizes that activists seek both types of goals in both the civil and political spheres.

As with other social movements, there is also conflict within and between LGBT movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements, and this also applies to changing education.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kitchen |first1=Julian |last2=Bellini |first2=Christine |title=Addressing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Issues in Teacher Education: Teacher Candidates' Perceptions |journal=Alberta Journal of Educational Research |date=2012 |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=444–460 |url=https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/ajer/article/view/55632 }}</ref> There is debate over what extent lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people, and others share common interests and a need to work together.  Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, 80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBT communities.<ref>Bull, C., and J. Gallagher (1996) Perfect Enemies: The Religious Right, the Gay Movement, and the Politics of the 1990s. New York: Crown.{{page needed|date=August 2020}}</ref> Roffee and Waling (2016) documented that LGBT people experience microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviors from other people within the LGBT community. This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails "LGBT". For example, transgender people found that other members of the community were not understanding to their own, individual, specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions, and this can cause health risks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Richard G. |title=Sexuality, Health, and Human Rights |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=June 2007 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=972–973 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.113365 |pmid=17463362 |pmc=1874191 }}</ref>  Additionally, bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of the bisexual sexuality. Evidently, even though most of these people would say that they stand for the same values as the majority of the community, there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBT community.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roffee |first1=James A. |last2=Waling |first2=Andrea |title=Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ youth |journal=Safer Communities |date=10 October 2016 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=190–201 |doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 }}</ref>

LGBT movements have often adopted a kind of [[identity politics]] that sees gay, bisexual, and transgender people as a fixed class of people; a [[minority group]] or groups, and this is very common among LGBT communities.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Balsam |first1=Kimberly F. |last2=Molina |first2=Yamile |last3=Beadnell |first3=Blair |last4=Simoni |first4=Jane |last5=Walters |first5=Karina |title=Measuring multiple minority stress: The LGBT People of Color Microaggressions Scale |journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology |date=April 2011 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=163–174 |doi=10.1037/a0023244 |pmid=21604840 |pmc=4059824 }}</ref> Those using this approach aspire to [[liberalism|liberal]] political goals of freedom and [[equal opportunity]], and aim to join the political mainstream on the same level as other groups in society.<ref>One example of this approach is: [[Andrew Sullivan|Sullivan, Andrew]] (1997). ''Same-Sex Marriage: Pro and Con''. New York: Vintage.{{page needed|date=August 2020}}</ref> In arguing that [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] are innate and cannot be consciously changed, attempts to change gay, lesbian, and bisexual people into heterosexuals ("[[conversion therapy]]") are generally opposed by the LGBT community. Such attempts are often based in [[religious beliefs]] that perceive gay, lesbian, and bisexual activity as immoral.

However, others within LGBT movements have criticized identity politics as limited and flawed, elements of the [[queer]] movement have argued that the categories of gay and lesbian are restrictive, and attempted to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] those categories, which are seen to "reinforce rather than challenge a cultural system that will always mark the non heterosexual as inferior."<ref>Bernstein (2002)</ref>

After the [[French Revolution]] the anticlerical feeling in Catholic countries coupled with the liberalizing effect of the [[Napoleonic Code]] made it possible to sweep away sodomy laws. However, in [[Protestant]] countries, where the church was less severe, there was no general reaction against statutes that were religious in origin. As a result, many of those countries retained their statutes on sodomy until late in the 20th century. However,some countries still have retained their statutes on sodomy. for example in 2008 a case in India's high court was judged using a 150 year old reading that was punishing sodomy.<ref>{{cite web |title=This Alien Legacy |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/12/17/alien-legacy/origins-sodomy-laws-british-colonialism |website=Human Rights Watch |date=17 December 2008 }}</ref>

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of LGBT history}}

=== Enlightenment era ===
In [[Enlightenment era|eighteenth]]- and [[History of Europe#19th century|nineteenth-century Europe]], same-sex sexual behavior and [[cross-dressing]] were widely considered to be socially unacceptable, and were serious crimes under [[sodomy]] and [[sumptuary law]]s. There were, however, some exceptions. For example, in the 17th century cross dressing was common in plays, as evident in the content of many of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays and by the actors in actual performance (since female roles in [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan theater]] were always performed by males, usually [[prepubescent]] boys).

[[Thomas Cannon]] wrote what may be the earliest published defense of homosexuality in English, ''Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify'd''  (1749). Although only fragments of his work have survived, it was a humorous anthology of homosexual advocacy, written with an obvious enthusiasm for its subject.<ref>{{cite book | title=Closeted writing and lesbian and gay literature: classical, early modern, eighteenth-century | first=David M. | last=Robinson | publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7546-5550-3 | page=38 }}</ref> It contains the argument: "Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts: Are not they, however constructed, and consequently impelling, Nature?"

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]], an early advocate for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.]]
Social reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote the first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785, at a time when the legal penalty for [[buggery]] was death by hanging. His advocacy stemmed from his [[utilitarianism|utilitarian philosophy]], in which the morality of an action is  determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being. He argued that homosexuality was a [[victimless crime]], and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings.<ref>[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham, Jeremy]], ''Offences Against One's Self'', c1785  ([http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/bentham/index.html full text online]).</ref> However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his powerful essay was not published until 1978.

The emerging currents of [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] thought that had inspired Bentham also informed the [[French Revolution]], and when the newly formed [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] began drafting the policies and laws of the new republic in 1792, groups of militant "sodomite-citizens" in Paris petitioned the [[Assemblée nationale]], the governing body of the [[French Revolution]], for freedom and recognition.<ref name="blasius">Blasius, Mark and Phelan, Shane (eds.), 1997. "We Are Everywhere: A Historical Sourcebook of Gay and Lesbian Politics", New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-90859-0}}</ref> In 1791, France became the first nation to decriminalize homosexuality, probably thanks in part to [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]], who was one of the authors of the [[Napoleonic Code]]. With the introduction of the Napoleonic Code in 1808, the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] also decriminalized homosexuality.<ref name="vwdiou">[http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/poland_S.pdf Poland]. ''The Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture''.</ref>

In 1830, the [https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/lim/lim-16-12-1830.htm new Penal Code] of the [[Brazilian Empire]] did not repeat the [http://www.ci.uc.pt/ihti/proj/filipinas/l5p1162.htm title XIII of the fifth book of the "Ordenações Philipinas"], which made [[sodomy]] a crime. In 1833, an anonymous English-language writer wrote a poetic defense of Captain Nicholas Nicholls, who had been sentenced to death in [[London]] for sodomy:

<blockquote><poem>Whence spring these inclinations, rank and strong?
And harming no one, wherefore call them wrong?<ref name="blasius" /></poem></blockquote>

Three years later in Switzerland, [[Heinrich Hössli|Heinrich Hoessli]] published the first volume of ''Eros: Die Männerliebe der Griechen'' (English: "Eros: The Male Love of the Greeks"), another defense of same-sex love.<ref name="blasius" />

In many ways, social attitudes to homosexuality became more hostile during the late [[Victorian era]]. In 1885, the [[Labouchere Amendment]] was included in the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|Criminal Law Amendment Act]], which criminalized 'any act of gross indecency with another male person'; a charge that was successfully invoked to convict playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1895 with the most severe sentence possible under the Act.

From the 1870s, [[social reform]]ers began to defend homosexuality, but due to the controversial nature of their advocacy, kept their identities secret.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A secret British society called the "[[Order of Chaeronea]]" campaigned for the legalization of homosexuality, and counted playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] among its members in the last decades of the 19th century.<ref>McKenna, Neil (2003), "The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde: An Intimate Biography".

In 1897, Ives created and founded the first homosexual rights group, the [[Order of Chaeronea]].<ref name=":1" /> Members included [[Charles Kains Jackson]], [[Samuel Elsworth Cottam]], [[Montague Summers]], and John Gambril Nicholson.

[[John Addington Symonds]] was a [[poet]] and an early advocate of male love. In 1873, he wrote ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'', a work of what would later be called "[[gay history]]."<ref>{{cite book|author=Katz|title=Love Stories|pages=243–244}}</ref> Although the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits the medical writer [[Charles Gilbert Chaddock|C.G. Chaddock]] for introducing "homosexual" into the English language in 1892, Symonds had already used the word in ''A Problem in Greek Ethics''.<ref>DeJean, "Sex and Philology," p. 132, pointing to the phrase [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_FJETAAAAQAAJ/page/n11 <!-- pg=2 quote="homosexual relations" inauthor:symonds. --> "homosexual relations"] (here as it appears in the later 1908 edition).</ref>

Symonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes, and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as ''Eudiades'', which has been called "the most famous of his homoerotic poems".<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Aldrich|title=The Seduction of the Mediterranean: Writing, Art, and Homosexual Fantasy|url=https://archive.org/details/seductionofmedit0000aldr|url-access=registration|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|page=[https://archive.org/details/seductionofmedit0000aldr/page/78 78]}}</ref> While the taboos of Victorian England prevented Symonds from speaking openly about homosexuality, his works published for a general audience contained strong implications and some of the first direct references to male-male sexual love in English literature. By the end of his life, Symonds' homosexuality had become an open secret in Victorian literary and cultural circles. In particular, Symonds' memoirs, written over a four-year period, from 1889 to 1893, form the one of the earliest known works of self-conscious homosexual autobiography in English.  The recently decoded autobiographies of Anne Lister are an earlier example in English.

Another friend of Ives was the English [[socialism|socialist]] poet [[Edward Carpenter]]. Carpenter thought that homosexuality was an innate and natural human characteristic and that it should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offense. In the 1890s, Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]], possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds, whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration. His 1908 book on the subject, ''[[The Intermediate Sex]]'', would become a foundational text of the [[LGBT movements]] of the 20th century. Scottish [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[John Henry Mackay]] also wrote in defense of same-sex love and [[androgyny]].

English [[sexology|sexologist]] [[Havelock Ellis]] wrote the first objective scientific study of homosexuality in 1897, in which he treated it as a neutral sexual condition. Called ''Sexual Inversion'' it was first printed in German and then translated into English a year later. In the book, Ellis argued that same-sex relationships could not be characterized as a [[pathology]] or a [[crime]] and that its importance rose above the arbitrary restrictions imposed by society.<ref>''Das Konträre Geschlechtsgefühle''. Leipzig, 1896. See {{cite book|last=White|first=Chris|title=Nineteenth-Century Writings on Homosexuality|year=1999|publisher=CRC Press|page=66}}</ref> He also studied what he called 'inter-generational relationships' and that these also broke societal [[taboo]]s on age difference in sexual relationships. The book was so controversial at the time that one bookseller was charged in court for holding copies of the work. It is claimed that Ellis coined the term 'homosexual', but in fact he disliked the word due to its conflation of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]].

These early proponents of LGBT rights, such as Carpenter, were often aligned with a broader socio-political movement known as '[[free love]]'; a critique of [[Victorian morality|Victorian sexual morality]] and the traditional institutions of family and marriage that were seen to enslave women. Some advocates of free love in the early 20th century, including Russian anarchist and feminist [[Emma Goldman]], also spoke in defence of same-sex love and challenged repressive legislation.

An early LGBT movement also began in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, centering on the doctor and writer [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. In 1897 he formed the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] campaign publicly against the notorious law "[[Paragraph 175]]", which made sex between men illegal. [[Adolf Brand]] later broke away from the group, disagreeing with Hirschfeld's medical view of the "[[Third gender|intermediate sex]]", seeing male-male sex as merely an aspect of manly virility and male social bonding. Brand was the first to use "[[outing]]" as a political strategy, claiming that German [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Bernhard von Bülow]] engaged in homosexual activity.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The 1901 book ''Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ([[English language|English]]: ''Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex'') by Aimée Duc was as much a political [[treatise]] as a novel, criticising pathological theories of homosexuality and gender inversion in women.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Breger |first1=Claudia |title=Feminine Masculinities: Scientific and Literary Representations of 'Female Inversion' at the Turn of the Twentieth Century |journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality |date=2005 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=76–106 |doi=10.1353/sex.2006.0004 |s2cid=142942952 }}</ref> [[Anna Rüling]], delivering a public speech in 1904 at the request of Hirschfeld, became the first female [[Uranian]] activist. Rüling, who also saw "men, women, and homosexuals" as three distinct genders, called for an alliance between the women's and sexual reform movements, but this speech is her only known contribution to the cause. Women only began to join the previously male-dominated sexual reform movement around 1910 when the German government tried to expand Paragraph 175 to outlaw sex between women. Heterosexual feminist leader [[Helene Stöcker]] became a prominent figure in the movement. [[Friedrich Radszuweit]] published LGBT literature and magazines in [[Berlin]] (e.g., ''Die Freundin'').

Hirschfeld, whose life was dedicated to social progress for people who were transsexual, transvestite and homosexual, formed the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in 1919. The institute conducted an enormous amount of research, saw thousands of transgender and homosexual clients at consultations, and championed a broad range of sexual reforms including sex education, contraception and women's rights. However, the gains made in Germany would soon be [[History of Gays during the Holocaust|drastically reversed]] with the rise of [[Nazism]], and the institute and its library were destroyed in 1933. The Swiss journal [[Der Kreis]] was the only part of the movement to continue through the Nazi era.

USSR's Criminal Code of 1922 decriminalized homosexuality.<ref name="Healey2001">{{cite book|author=Dan Healey|title=Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: The Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_Et9nlFT2YC|access-date=27 October 2012|date=15 October 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-32233-9|page=3}}</ref> This was a remarkable step in the USSR at the time – which was very backward economically and socially, and where many conservative attitudes towards sexuality prevailed. This step was part of a larger project of freeing sexual relationships and expanding women's rights – including legalizing abortion, granting divorce on demand, equal rights for women, and attempts to socialize housework. During Stalin's era, however, USSR reverted all these progressive measures – re-criminalizing homosexuality and imprisoning gay men and banning abortion.

In 1928, English writer [[Radclyffe Hall]] published a novel titled ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]''. Its plot centers on Stephen Gordon, a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing's ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (Richard von Krafft-Ebing book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]'', and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 320.</ref> Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing's theories and rejected (conservatively understood version of) Freud's theory that [[same-sex attraction]] was caused by childhood trauma and was curable.<ref>Doan, p. XIII.</ref>

In the United States, several secret or semi-secret groups were formed explicitly to advance the rights of homosexuals as early as the turn of the 20th century, but little is known about them.<ref>Norton, Rictor, (2005), "[http://rictornorton.co.uk/suppress.htm The Suppression of Lesbian and Gay History]"</ref> A better documented group is [[Henry Gerber]]'s [[Society for Human Rights]] formed in Chicago in 1924, which was quickly suppressed.<ref name="when">Bullough, Vern, "[http://hnn.us/articles/11316.html When Did the Gay Rights Movement Begin?]", 18 April 2005</ref>

Immediately following [[World War II]], a number of homosexual rights groups came into being or were revived across the [[Western world]], in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. These groups usually preferred the term ''homophile'' to ''homosexual'', emphasizing love over sex. The homophile movement began in the late 1940s with groups in the Netherlands and Denmark, and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s with groups in Sweden, Norway, the United States, [[Arcadie (French homophile organization)|France]], Britain and elsewhere.

A 1962 gay march held in front of [[Independence Hall]] in Philadelphia, according to some historians, marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the LGBT youth organization Vanguard was formed by Adrian Ravarour to demonstrate for equality, and Vanguard members protested for equal rights during the months of April–July 1966, followed by the August 1966 Compton's riot, where transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, [[Compton's Cafeteria riot|Gene Compton's Cafeteria.]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernadicou |first1=August |title=Adrian Ravarour |url=https://www.augustnation.com/adrian-ravarour |website=August Nation |publisher=The LGBTQ History Project |access-date=27 June 2019}}</ref>

The [[Wolfenden Report]] was published in Britain on 4 September 1957 after publicized convictions for homosexuality of well-known men, including [[Lord Montagu]]. Disregarding the conventional ideas of the day, the committee recommended that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence". All but James Adair were in favor of this and, contrary to some medical and psychiatric witnesses' evidence at that time, found that "homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease, because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects." The report added, "The law's function is to preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is offensive or injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others … It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private life of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour."

The report eventually led to the introduction of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|Sexual Offences Bill 1967]] supported by [[labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Roy Jenkins]], then the Labour [[Home Secretary]]. When passed, the [[Sexual Offences Act]] decriminalised homosexual acts between two men over 21 years of age ''in private'' in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. The seemingly innocuous phrase 'in private' led to the prosecution of participants in sex acts involving three or more men, eg the [[Bolton 7]] who were so convicted as recently as 1998.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/02/tories-out-in-force-gay-pride "From Section 28 to a Home Office float – Tories come out in force at gay march"], ''The Guardian'', London, 3 July 2010.</ref>

Bisexual activism became more visible toward the end of the 1960s in the United States. In 1966 bisexual activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A. Martin (a.k.a. Donny the Punk)]] founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group.<ref name="binetusa">{{cite web|url=http://www.binetusa.org/bihealth.html|title=TIMELINE: THE BISEXUAL HEALTH MOVEMENT IN THE US|publisher=BiNetUSA|access-date=2013-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207185405/http://www.binetusa.org/bihealth.html|archive-date=2019-02-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> Activism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow, especially in San Francisco. One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967.<ref name="binetusa" /> Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual.

The American Psychiatric Association removed "homosexuality" from the diagnostics manual of mental illness in 1973.

The [[new social movements]] of the sixties, such as the [[Black Power]] and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam war]] movements in the US, the May 1968 insurrection in France, and [[Feminist movement|Women's Liberation]] throughout the Western world, inspired many LGBT activists to become more radical,<ref name="matzner" /> and the [[Gay Liberation]] movement emerged towards the end of the decade. This new radicalism is often attributed to the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, when a group of gay men, transgender women, lesbians, and drag queens at a bar in [[New York City|New York]] resisted a police raid.<ref name="when" />

Immediately after Stonewall, such groups as the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) and the [[Gay Activists' Alliance]] (GAA) were formed. Their use of the word ''[[gay]]'' represented a new unapologetic defiance—as an antonym for ''straight'' ("respectable sexual behavior"), it encompassed a range of non-normative sexuality and sought ultimately to free the bisexual potential in everyone, rendering obsolete the categories of homosexual and heterosexual.<ref>[[Dennis Altman|Altman, D.]] (1971).

Chapters of the GLF were established across the U.S. and in other parts of the Western world. The [[Front Homosexuel d'Action Révolutionnaire]] was formed in 1971 by lesbians who split from the [[Mouvement Homophile de France]].

The [[Gay liberation|Gay Liberation]] movement overall, like the gay community generally and historically, has had varying degrees of gender nonconformity and assimilationist platforms among its members. Early marches by the Mattachine society and Daughters of Bilitis stressed looking "respectable" and mainstream, and after the Stonewall Uprising the Mattachine Society posted a sign in the window of the club calling for peace. Gender nonconformity has always been a primary way of signaling homosexuality and bisexuality, and by the late 1960s and mainstream fashion was increasingly incorporating what by the 1970s would be considered "unisex" fashions. In 1970, the [[drag queen]] caucus of the GLF, including [[Marsha P. Johnson]] and [[Sylvia Rivera]], formed the group [[Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries]] (STAR), which focused on providing support for gay prisoners, housing for homeless gay youth and street people, especially other young "street queens".<ref name=ACTUP>Shepard, Benjamin Heim and Ronald Hayduk (2002) ''From ACT UP to the WTO: Urban Protest and Community Building in the Era of Globalization''.

Bisexual activist [[Brenda Howard]] is known as the ''"Mother of Pride"'' for her work in coordinating the march, which occurred in 1970 in New York City, and she also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around Pride Day which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June.<ref name="thirteen.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thirteen.org/13pressroom/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118011642/http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/release.php?get=2475|url-status=dead|title=Pressroom &#124; THIRTEEN|archive-date=January 18, 2008|website=Pressroom}}</ref><ref name="queerty.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.queerty.com/the-gay-pride-issue-20070618|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712233212/http://www.queerty.com/the-gay-pride-issue-20070618/|url-status=dead|title=The Gay Pride Issue|first=Andrew|last=Belonksy|date=June 18, 2007|archive-date=July 12, 2015|website=queerty.com}}</ref> Additionally, Howard along with the bisexual activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A.

One of the values of the movement was [[gay pride]]. Within weeks of the Stonewall Riots, [[Craig Rodwell]], proprietor of the [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop|Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]] in lower Manhattan, persuaded the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) to replace the Fourth of July Annual Reminder at Independence Hall in Philadelphia with a first commemoration of the Stonewall Riots. Liberation groups, including the Gay Liberation Front, Queens, the Gay Activists Alliance, Radicalesbians, and Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (STAR) all took part in the first Gay Pride Week. Los Angeles held a big parade on the first Gay Pride Day. Smaller demonstrations were held in San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

In the United Kingdom the GLF had its first meeting in the basement of the [[London School of Economics]] on 13 October 1970. [[Bob Mellors]] and Aubrey Walter had seen the effect of the GLF in the United States and created a parallel movement based on revolutionary politics and alternative lifestyle.<ref name=outrage-p2>{{harvnb|Lucas|1998|p=2}}</ref>

By 1974, internal disagreements had led to the movement's splintering. Organizations that spun off from the movement included the [[London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard]], ''[[Gay News]]'', and [[Gay's the Word (bookshop)|Icebreakers]]. The GLF Information Service continued for a few further years providing gay related resources.<ref>{{harvnb|Lucas|1998|p=3}}</ref> GLF branches had been set up in some provincial British towns (e.g., Bradford, Bristol, Leeds, and Leicester) and some survived for a few years longer. The Leicester group founded by Jeff Martin was noted for its involvement in the setting up of the local "Gayline", which is still active today and has received funding from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]. They also carried out a high-profile campaign against the local paper, the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'', which refused to advertise Gayline's services at the time.<ref>''Gay News'' (1978) No. 135; ''Peace News'' (13 January 1978)</ref>

From 1970 activists protested the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in their [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], and in 1974 it was replaced with a category of "sexual orientation disturbance" then "ego-dystonic homosexuality," which was also deleted, although "gender identity disorder" (a term used for [[Gender dysphoria]]) remains.

In 1972, [[Sweden]] became the first country in the world to allow people who were transsexual by [[legislation]] to surgically change their sex and provide free [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]].

[[Lesbian feminism]], which was most influential from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, encouraged women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and advocated lesbianism as the logical result of feminism.<ref>[[Adrienne Rich|Rich, A]].

Many women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations; some who felt gender differences between men and women could not be resolved developed "[[lesbian separatism]]," influenced by writings such as [[Jill Johnston]]'s 1973 book ''Lesbian Nation''.

The term "gay" came to be more strongly associated with homosexual males.

In Canada, the coming into effect of [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 15]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] in 1985 saw a shift in the gay rights movement in Canada, as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies. Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the immutability of homosexuality, judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights, including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same-sex marriage. It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change.<ref>Lehman, M.

Another setback in the United States occurred in 1986, when the US Supreme Court upheld a Georgia anti-sodomy law in the case ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]''.  (This ruling would be overturned two decades later in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]).

=====AIDS epidemic=====
Some historians posit that a new era of the gay rights movement began in the 1980s with the emergence of [[AIDS]], which decimated the leadership and shifted the focus for many.<ref name="before" /> This era saw a resurgence of militancy with [[direct action]] groups like [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT UP), formed in 1987, as well as its offshoots [[Queer Nation]] (1990) and the [[Lesbian Avengers]] (1992). Some younger activists, seeing ''gay and lesbian'' as increasingly normative and politically conservative, began using ''[[queer]]'' as a defiant statement of all [[sexual minority|sexual minorities]] and [[gender variant]] people—just as the earlier liberationists had done with ''gay''. Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people also became prominent, including various [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]] like ''[[LGBT]]'', ''LGBTQ'', and ''LGBTI'', where the ''Q'' and ''I'' stand for ''[[queer]]'' or ''[[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]]'' and ''[[intersex]]'', respectively.

====="The Overhauling of Straight America"=====
A 1987 essay titled "The Overhauling of Straight America", by [[Marshall Kirk]] and Hunter Madsen (writing as Erastes Pill),<ref>{{cite document |title=The Overhauling of Straight America |url=http://library.gayhomeland.org/0018/EN/EN_Overhauling_Straight.htm |author=Kirk, Marshall and Pill, Erastes (pseud.) |date=1987 |publisher=Guide Magazine}}</ref> lays out a six-point plan for a campaign, which was first published in ''Guide'' magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans "to think that it is just another thing, with a shrug of their shoulders". Then "your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book ''"After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s."''  The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. It argues that after the [[gay liberation]] phase of the 1970s and 1980s, gay rights groups should adopt more professional public relations techniques to convey their message. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of ''Newsweek'', ''Time'' and ''The Washington Post''. The book is often critically described by social conservatives such as [[Focus on the Family]] as important to the success of the LGBT Movement in the 90's and as part of an alleged "homosexual agenda".<ref name="osten">{{Citation

To help facilitate this we need national media workshops to train our leaders. And we must encourage our gay and lesbian press to increase coverage of the national process. Our media efforts are fundamental to the full acceptance of us in American life. But they are also a way for us to increase the funding of our movement.

The 1990s also saw a rapid push of the [[transgender]] movement, while at the same time a "sidelining of the identity of those who are transsexual." In the English-speaking world, [[Leslie Feinberg]] published ''Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come'' in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.workers.org/book/transgender-liberation-a-movement-whose-time-has-come/|title=Transgender Liberation: A movement whose time has come|last=Feinberg|first=Leslie|website=Workers World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref> Gender-variant peoples across the globe also formed minority rights movements. [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] activists campaigned for recognition as a [[third gender|third sex]] in India and [[Travesti (gender identity)|Travesti]] groups began to organize against police brutality across [[Latin America]] while activists in the [[United States]] formed direct-confrontation groups such as the [[Transexual Menace]].

[[Eric Rofes]] author of the book, ''A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer?'', argues that the inclusion of teachings on [[homosexuality]] in public schools will play an important role in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals.<ref name="Rofes">Rofes, Eric E. "Chapter 2: Candy from Strangers: Queer Teachers and the (Im)Moral Development of Children." A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer. Ed. Eric E. Rofes. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2005. 15–37. Print.</ref>  As a former teacher in the public school system, Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay. As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take [[political radicalism|radical]] approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality.<ref name="Rofes" /> According to Rofes, radical approaches are grounded in the belief that "something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur."The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay rights]] activists such as [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]]. Former [[California]] senator, John Briggs proposed [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], a [[ballot initiative]] that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors, along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be " the corruption of the children's minds".<ref name="Fetner">Fetner, Tina. 2008. How the Religious Rights Shaped Lesbian and Gay Activism. University of Minnesota Press.</ref> The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum, in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools, has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs that will help them come to terms with their sexual orientation.<ref name="Rofes" /> Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs, such as [[Out There (youth program)|Out There]] and [[Committee for Gay Youth]], stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation.

[[David Campos]], author of the book, ''Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook'', illuminates the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A1247C|title=Sex, Youth, and Sex Education|website=abc-clio.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref> Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of [[heterosexuality]] are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them. However, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth.<ref name="Campos">{{cite book|author=Campos, David|title=Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook|location=Washington, D.C|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FKmVUwbUlGgC|isbn=978-1-57607-776-4}}</ref> It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these [[homosexual]] youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.<ref name="Campos" />

Many opponents of LGBT social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals.<ref name="Fetner" /> In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in schools entirely. In her book entitled "Gay and Lesbian Movement," [[Margaret Cruickshank]] provides statistical data from the [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris and Yankelovich polls]] which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and [[abortion]] should be included in the curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of all parents actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.<ref name="Darder">{{cite book|editor1=Darder, Antoninia|editor2=Marta Baltodano|editor3=Raldolfo Torres|name-list-style=amp|title=The Critical Pedagogy Reader|location=New York, NY|publisher=Routledge Falmer|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2bvKJ6S-L8C&pg=PA496|isbn=978-0-415-92261-6}}</ref>

It had been suggested that education has a positive impact on support for same sex marriage. African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational achievement; however, the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards [[same-sex marriage]] as it does on white attitudes. Educational attainment among whites has a significant positive effect on support for same-sex marriage, whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant. The income levels of whites have a direct and positive correlation with support for same-sex marriage, but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same-sex marriage.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite journal |last1=Sherkat |first1=Darren E. |last2=de Vries |first2=Kylan Mattias |last3=Creek |first3=Stacia |title=Race, Religion, and Opposition to Same-Sex Marriage |journal=Social Science Quarterly |date=March 2010 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=80–98 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2010.00682.x |url=https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/ps_wp/5 }}</ref>

Location also affects ideas towards same-sex marriage; residents of [[rural]] and southern areas are significantly more opposed to same-sex marriage in comparison to residents elsewhere. Gays and lesbians that live in rural areas face many challenges, including: sparse populations and the traditional culture held closely by the small population of most rural areas, generally hostile social climates towards gays relative to urban areas, and less social and institution support and access compared to urban areas.<ref>Wienke, Chris & Hill, Gretchen. (2013). Does Place of Residence Matter? Rural-Urban Differences and the Wellbeing of Gay Men and Lesbians. Journal of homosexuality. 60. 1256-79. 10.1080/00918369.2013.806166.</ref> In order to combat this problem that the LGBT community faces, social networks and apps such as Moovs have been created for "LGBT individuals with like-minds" that are "enabled to connect, share, and feel the heartbeat of the community as one."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/17876310/|title=Moovz - The Global LGBT Social Network}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/28/moovz-gay-social-network_n_4681259.html|title='Moovz,' Gay Social Network, Launched By Interacting Technology|last=Nichols|first=JamesMichael|date=2014-01-28|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}</ref>

In a study conducted by Darren E. Sherkat, Kylan M. de Vries, and Stacia Creek at the [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]],  researchers found that women tend to be more consistently supportive of LGBT rights than men and that individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same-sex couples than married or widowed individuals. They also claimed that white women are significantly more supportive than white men, but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans. The year in which one was born was also found to be a strong indicator of attitude towards same-sex marriage—generations born after 1946 are considerably more supportive of same-sex marriage than older generations. Finally, the study reported that statistically African Americans are more opposed to same-sex marriage than any other ethnicity.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Studies show that Non-Protestant Christians are much more likely to support same-sex unions than [[Protestants]]; 63% of African Americans claim that they are [[Black church|Baptist]] or Protestant, whereas only 30% of white Americans are. [[Religion]], as measured by individuals' religious affiliations, behaviors, and beliefs, has a lot of influence in structuring same-sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality. The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by [[Jews]], liberal Protestants, and people who are not affiliated with religion. This is because many of their religious traditions have not "systematically condemned homosexual behaviors" in recent years. Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants. And lastly, the most conservative views are held by [[Evangelicalism in the United States|Evangelical Protestants]]. Moreover, it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation. Organized religion, especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations, espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same-sex unions. Therefore, these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature. Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same-sex marriage and homosexuality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Olson |first1=Laura R. |last2=Cadge |first2=Wendy |last3=Harrison |first3=James T. |title=Religion and Public Opinion about Same-Sex Marriage* |journal=Social Science Quarterly |date=June 2006 |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=340–360 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00384.x }}</ref>

Fiction literature also has an increased role in shaping people's attitude towards same-sex marriages. An original idea appears in [[Rafael Grugman]] dystopian fiction book ''[[Nontraditional Love]]'' (2008). He describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world (in this world same-sex love is a traditional love). At the heart of the novel is a love story between a man and a woman who unfortunately were born as heterosexuals in a homosexual world and they forced to hide their feelings and their sexual orientation. For a homosexual society love between man and women is a non-traditional love. Underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right of every person to be themselves. It is unusual approach that supports human rights of all people and same-sex marriages.<ref>{{cite book|first=Rafael|last=Grugman|title=Nontraditional Love|location=New York|publisher=Liberty Publishing House|year=2008}}</ref>
