The Russian Soviet Republic was proclaimed on 7 November 1917 ([[October Revolution]]) as a [[sovereign state]] and the world's first constitutionally [[socialist state]] guided by [[communist ideology]]. The [[Soviet Russia Constitution of 1918|first Constitution]] was adopted in 1918. In 1922, the Russian SFSR signed the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR]] officially setting up of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The [[1977 Soviet Constitution]] stated that "[a] Union Republic is a sovereign [...] state that has united [...] in the Union"<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of the Soviet Union (1977, Unamended)#Chapter 9. The Union Soviet Socialist Republic|Article 76]]</ref> and "each Union Republic shall retain the right freely to secede from the USSR".<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of the Soviet Union (1977, Unamended)#Chapter 8. The USSR - Federal State|Article 72]]</ref> On 12 June 1990, the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]] adopted the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian SFSR|Declaration of State Sovereignty]], established [[separation of powers]] (unlike in the [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet form of government]]), established [[citizenship of Russia]] and stated that the RSFSR shall retain the right of free secession from the USSR. On 12 June 1991, [[Boris Yeltsin]] (1931–2007), supported by the [[Democratic Russia]] pro-reform movement, was [[1991 Russian presidential election|elected]] the first and only [[President of the Russian Federation|President of the RSFSR]], a post that would later become the presidency of the Russian Federation.

The [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] with the temporary brief internment of President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] destabilised the Soviet Union. On 8 December 1991, the heads of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed the [[Belavezha Accords]]. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its original founding states (i.e., renunciation of the 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) as a loose confederation. On 12 December, the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Soviet (the parliament of Russian SFSR); therefore the Russian SFSR had renounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and ''de facto'' declared Russia's independence from the USSR itself and the ties with the other Soviet Socialist Republics.

On 25 December 1991, following the resignation of Gorbachev as [[President of the Soviet Union]] (and former [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]), the Russian SFSR was renamed the [[Russian Federation]].<ref>The names Russian Federation and Russia are equal since 25 December 1993</ref> The next day after the lowering of the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet red flag]] from the top of the [[Kremlin Senate]] building of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] in [[Moscow]], the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR was self-dissolved]] by the [[Soviet of the Republics]] on 26 December, which by that time was the only functioning parliamentary chamber of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|All-Union Supreme Soviet]] (the other house, [[Soviet of the Union]], had already lost the [[quorum]] after recall of its members by the several union republics). After the dissolution, Russia declared that it assumed the rights and obligations of the dissolved central Soviet government, [[Russia and the United Nations|including UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council]], but originally excluding foreign debt and foreign assets of the USSR (also parts of the former Soviet [[Red Army]] and nuclear weapons remained under overall CIS command as {{ill|CIS United Armed Forces|WD=Q4330429}}).

The [[1978 RSFSR Constitution]] was amended several times to reflect the transition to democracy, private property and market economy. The new [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]], coming into effect on 25 December 1993 after a [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]], completely abolished the [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet form of government]] and replaced it with a [[semi-presidential system]].

Under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1870–1924) and [[Leon Trotsky]] (1879–1940), the [[Bolshevik]] [[communist]]s established the [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] state on {{OldStyleDate|7 November|1917|25 October}}. It happened immediately after the interim [[Russian Provisional Government]], most recently led by opposing democratic socialist [[Alexander Kerensky]] (1881–1970), which governed the new [[Russian Republic]] after the overthrow of the [[Russian Empire]] government of the  [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] imperial dynasty of Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] the previous [[Russian Revolution|March]], was now itself overthrown during the following [[October Revolution]], the second of the two [[Russian Revolution]]s that turbulent year of 1917 during [[World War I]]. Initially, the state did not have an official name and wasn't recognized by neighboring countries for five months. Meanwhile, anti-Bolsheviks coined the mocking label Sovdepia for the nascent state of the Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies.<ref>{{cite book |last = Mawdsley |first = Evan |chapter = Sovdepia: The Soviet Zone, October 1917 – November 1918 |title = The Russian Civil War |year = 2007 |url = https://archive.org/details/russiancivilwar00evan |url-access = registration |publisher = Pegasus Books |publication-date = 2007 |page = [https://archive.org/details/russiancivilwar00evan/page/70 70] |isbn = 9781933648156 |accessdate = 25 January 2014 |quote = The Bolsheviks' enemies gave the name 'Sovdepia' to the area under the authority of the Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies.

On 10 July 1918, the [[Soviet Russia Constitution of 1918|Russian Constitution of 1918]] renamed the country the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.<ref name="russians1">[http://russians.net/ Soviet Russia information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826032442/http://www.russians.net/ |date=26 August 2010 }}.

Internationally, the RSFSR was recognized as an independent state in 1920 only by bordering neighbors of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] in the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] and by the short-lived [[Irish Republic]] in [[Ireland]].<ref>Carr, EH ''The Bolshevik Revolution 1917–23, vol 3'' Penguin Books, London, 4th reprint (1983), pp. 257–258.

On 30 December 1922, [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|with the treaty on the creation of the Soviet Union]], Russia, alongside the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The final Soviet name for the constituent republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, was adopted in the later [[Soviet Constitution of 1936]]. By that time, Soviet Russia had gained roughly the same borders of the old [[Tsardom of Russia]] before the [[Great Northern War]] of 1700.

For most of the Soviet Union's existence, it was commonly referred to as Russia, even though technically Russia itself  was only one republic within the larger union of 15 republics—albeit by far the largest, most powerful and most highly developed.

On 25 December 1991, during the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], which concluded on the next day, the republic was [[Geographical renaming|officially renamed]] the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], which it remains to this day.<ref>[http://marxistsfr.org/history/ussr/government/1928/sufds/ch28.htm Chronicle of Events] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727070057/http://marxistsfr.org/history/ussr/government/1928/sufds/ch28.htm |date=27 July 2011 }}.

==Geography==
At a total of about 17,125,200&nbsp;km (6,612,100 sq mi), the Russian SFSR was the largest of its fifteen republics, with its southerly neighbor, the [[Kazakh SSR]], being second.

The international borders of the RSFSR touched [[Poland]] on the west; [[Norway]] and [[Finland]] of [[Scandinavia]] on the northwest; and to its southeast in eastern [[Asia]] were the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] ([[North Korea]]), [[Mongolian People's Republic]] ([[Mongolia]]) and the [[People's Republic of China]] ([[China]], formerly the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]]; 1911–1949). Within the Soviet Union, the RSFSR bordered the [[Slav]]ic states: [[Ukrainian SSR]] ([[Ukraine]]), [[Belarusian SSR]] ([[Belarus]]), the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] states: [[Estonian SSR]] ([[Estonia]]), [[Latvian SSR]] ([[Latvia]]) and [[Lithuanian SSR]] ([[Lithuania]]) (annexed forcibly in 1940) to its west and the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] ([[Azerbaijan]]), [[Georgian SSR]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) and [[Kazakh SSR]] ([[Kazakhstan]]) to the south in [[Central Asia]].<ref name="TFD" />

Roughly 70% of the area in the RSFSR consisted of broad [[plain]]s, with mountainous tundra regions mainly concentrated in the east of [[Siberia]] with [[Central Asia]] and [[East Asia]]. The area is rich in mineral resources, including [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], and [[iron ore]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://russia.rin.ru/guides_e/4319.html |title = Russia the Great: Mineral resources |publisher = Russian Information Network |accessdate = 22 November 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110119081833/http://russia.rin.ru/guides_e/4319.html |archive-date = 19 January 2011 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

{{History of Russia|right}}

===Early years (1917–1920)===
The Soviet government first came to power on 7 November 1917, immediately after the interim [[Russian Provisional Government]] later headed by democratic socialist [[Alexander Kerensky]], which governed the [[Russian Republic]], was overthrown in the [[October Revolution]], the second of the two [[Russian Revolutions]]. The state it governed, which did not have an official name, would be unrecognized by neighboring countries for another five months.

On 25 January 1918, at the third meeting of the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]], the unrecognized state was renamed the Russian Soviet Republic.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> On 3 March 1918, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed, giving away much of the land of the former [[Russian Empire]] to the [[German Empire]] ([[Germany]]), in exchange for peace on the [[Eastern Front of World War I|Eastern Front]] of [[World War I]]. On 10 July 1918, the Russian Constitution of 1918 renamed the country the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.<ref name="russians1"/> By 1918, during the [[Russian Civil War]], several states within the former Russian Empire had seceded, reducing the size of the country even more.

The [[Russian famine of 1921–22]], also known as [[Volga region|Povolzhye]] famine, killed an estimated 5&nbsp;million, primarily affecting the Volga and Ural River regions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/TheBlackBookofCommunism10/the-black-book-of-communism-jean-louis-margolin-1999-communism#page/n71/|title=The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression|last1=Courtois|first1=Stéphane|last2=Werth|first2=Nicolas|last3=Panné|first3=Jean-Louis|last4=Paczkowski|first4=Andrzej|last5=Bartošek|first5=Karel|last6=Margolin|first6=Jean-Louis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780674076082|pages=123|access-date=5 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627125452/http://archive.org/stream/TheBlackBookofCommunism10/the-black-book-of-communism-jean-louis-margolin-1999-communism#page/n71/|archive-date=27 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 30 December 1922, the [[Congress of Soviets|First Congress of the Soviets of the USSR]] approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, by which Russia was united with the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and [[Transcaucasian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic]] into a single federal state, the Soviet Union. The treaty was included in the [[1924 Soviet Constitution]],{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} adopted on 31 January 1924 by the [[Congress of Soviets|Second Congress of Soviets of the USSR]].

Paragraph&nbsp;3 of Chapter&nbsp;1 of the 1925 Constitution of the RSFSR stated the following:<ref>Constitution (Basic Law) of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (approved by [[Twelfth All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] on 11 May 1925).</ref>

<blockquote>By the will of the peoples of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, who decided on the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics during the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|Tenth All-Russian Congress of Soviets]], the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, being a part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, devolves to the Union the powers which according to Article&nbsp;1 of the Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are included within the scope of responsibilities of the government bodies of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</blockquote>

===1930s===
[[File:Soviet Union - Russian SFSR (1936).svg|thumb|The Russian SFSR in 1936]]

Many regions in Russia were affected by the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]]: [[Volga River|Volga]]; Central Black Soil Region; [[Caucasus Mountains|North Caucasus]]; the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]]; [[Crimea|the Crimea]]; part of [[Western Siberia]]; and the [[Kazak ASSR]]. With the adoption of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] on 5 December 1936, the size of the RSFSR was significantly reduced. The [[Kazak Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic|Kazakh ASSR]] and [[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1926–1936)|Kirghiz ASSR]] were transformed into the [[Kazakh SSR]] ([[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] ([[Kyrgyzstan]]). The former [[Karakalpak Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic]] was transferred to the [[Uzbek SSR]] ([[Uzbekistan]]).

The final name for the republic during the Soviet era was adopted by the Russian Constitution of 1937, which renamed it the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR).

===1940s===
[[File:Soviet Union - Russian SFSR (1940).svg|thumb|The Russian SFSR in 1940]]
{{See also|Eastern Front (World War II)}}

In 1943, [[Karachay Autonomous Oblast]] was dissolved by [[Joseph Stalin]] (1878–1953), General Secretary of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and Marshall, later Premier and dictator, when the [[Karachays]] were exiled to [[Central Asia]] for their alleged collaboration with the invading [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germans]] in the [[Great Patriotic War]] ([[World War II]], 1941–1945), and territory was incorporated into the [[Georgian SSR]].

On 3 March 1944, on the orders of Stalin, the [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Chechen-Ingush ASSR]] was disbanded and its [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|population forcibly deported]] upon the accusations of [[collaboration]] with the invaders and [[separatism]]. The territory of the ASSR was divided between other administrative units of Russian SFSR and the [[Georgian SSR]].

On 11 October 1944, the [[Tuvan People's Republic]] was joined with the Russian SFSR as the [[Tuvan Autonomous Oblast]], becoming an [[Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1961.

After reconquering Estonia and Latvia in 1944, the Russian SFSR annexed their easternmost territories around [[Ivangorod]] and within the modern [[Pechorsky District|Pechorsky]] and [[Pytalovsky District]]s in 1944–1945.

At the end of World War II Soviet troops of the [[Red Army]] occupied southern [[Sakhalin]] Island and the [[Kuril Islands]] off the coast of East Asia,  north of [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], making them part of the RSFSR. The status of the southernmost Kurils, north of [[Hokkaido]] of the Japanese home islands remains in dispute with Japan and the [[United States]] following the peace treaty of 1951 ending the state of war.

On 17 April 1946, the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] — the north-eastern portion of the former [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the founding state of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918) and later the [[German Reich|German]] province of [[East Prussia]] including the capital and [[Baltic Sea|baltic]] seaport city of [[Königsberg]] — was annexed by the Soviet Union and made part of the Russian SFSR.

===1950s===
After the death of Joseph Stalin, 5 March 1953, [[Georgy Malenkov]] became the new leader of the USSR.

In January 1954, Malenkov [[transferred Crimea]] from the Russian SFSR to the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

On 8 February 1955, Malenkov was officially demoted to deputy Prime Minister. As First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Nikita Khrushchev's authority was significantly enhanced by Malenkov's demotion.

The [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]] was transferred back to the RSFSR as the [[Karelian ASSR]] in 1956.

On 9 January 1957, [[Karachay Autonomous Oblast]] and [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] were restored by Khrushchev and they were transferred from the [[Georgian SSR]] back to the [[Russian SFSR]].

===1960s–1980s===
In 1964, Nikita Khrushchev was removed from his position of power and replaced with [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. Under his rule, the Russian SFSR and the rest of the Soviet Union went through an [[era of stagnation]]. Even after he died in 1982, the era did not end until [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] took power in March 1985 and introduced liberal reforms in Soviet society.

===Early 1990s===

[[File:Flag of Russia 1991-1993.svg|thumb|right|Flag adopted by the Russian SFSR national parliament in 1991]]

On 29 May 1990, at his third attempt, Boris Yeltsin was [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia#Sessions|elected]] the chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]]. The [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies of the Republic]] adopted the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian SFSR]] on 12 June 1990, which was the beginning of the "[[War of Laws]]", pitting the Soviet Union against the Russian Federation and other constituent republics.

On 17 March 1991, an [[1991 Russian presidential referendum|all-Russian referendum]] created the post of [[President of Russia|President of the RSFSR]]. On 12 June, [[Boris Yeltsin]] was elected President of Russia by [[1991 Russian presidential election|popular vote]]. During an [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|unsuccessful coup attempt]] on 19–21 August 1991 in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union and Russia, President of Russia Yeltsin strongly supported the President of the Soviet Union, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

After the failure of [[Gang of Eight (Soviet Union)|GKChP]], in the presence of Gorbachev, on 23 August 1991, Yeltsin signed a decree suspending all activity by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Communist Party of the Russian SFSR]] in the territory of Russia.<ref>Decree of the President of the Russian SFSR of 23 August 1991 No.&nbsp;79</ref> On 6 November, he went further, banning the Communist Parties of the USSR and the RSFSR from the territory of the RSFSR.<ref>Decree of the President of the Russian SFSR 06.11. 1991 N169 "On activity of the CPSU and the Communist Party of the Russian SFSR"</ref>

On 8 December 1991, at [[Viskuli]] near [[Brest (Belarus)]], Yeltsin, [[President of Ukraine|Ukrainian President]] [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and [[Belarus]]ian leader [[Stanislau Shushkevich]] signed the "Agreement on the Establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States", known in media as the [[Belavezha Accords]]. The document, consisting of a preamble and fourteen articles, stated that the Soviet Union no longer existed "as a subject of [[international law]] and geopolitical reality". However, based on the historical community of peoples and relations between the three states, as well as bilateral treaties, the desire for a democratic rule of law, the intention to develop their relations based on mutual recognition and respect for state sovereignty, the parties agreed to the formation of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. On 12 December, the agreement was ratified by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] by an overwhelming majority: 188 votes for, 6 against and 7 abstentions<ref>Francis X. Clines, [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/13/world/soviet-disarry-gorbachev-is-ready-to-resign-as-post-soviet-plan-advances.html "Gorbachev is Ready to Resign as Post-Soviet Plan Advances"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 13, 1991.</ref>. The legality of this ratification raised doubts among some members of the Russian parliament, since according to the Constitution of the RSFSR of 1978 consideration of this document was in the exclusive jurisdiction of the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR]].<ref>''V.Pribylovsky, Gr.Tochkin'' [http://sssr.net.ru/denons.html .

On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR denounced the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR]] and recalled all Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. A number of lawyers believe that the denunciation of the union treaty was meaningless since it became invalid in 1924 with the adoption of the [[1924 Constitution of the Soviet Union|first constitution of the USSR]]<ref>''Исаков В.

Although the 12 December vote is sometimes reckoned as the moment that the RSFSR seceded from the collapsing Soviet Union, this is not the case. It appears that the RSFSR took the line that it was not possible to secede from an entity that no longer existed.

On 24 December, Yeltsin informed the [[UN Secretary-General|Secretary-General of the United Nations]] that by agreement of the member states of the CIS the Russian Federation would assume the membership of the Soviet Union in all UN organs (including the Soviet Union's permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]]). Thus, Russia is considered to be an original member of the UN (since 24 October 1945) along with [[Ukraine]] ([[Ukrainian SSR]]) and [[Belarus]] ([[Byelorussian SSR]]). On 25 December—just hours after Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union—the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation ([[Russia]]), reflecting that it was now a sovereign state with Yeltsin assuming the [[President of Russia|Presidency]].<ref name="RF">[[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] approved the Law of the RSFSR #2094-I of 25 December 1991 [http://www.humanities.edu.ru/db/msg/12047 "On renaming of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520175808/http://www.humanities.edu.ru/db/msg/12047 |date=20 May 2009 }} // Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian SFSR and Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR Daily. – 1992. – № 2. – Article&nbsp;62</ref> That same night, the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] was lowered and replaced with the [[Flag of Russia|tricolor]].

According to law, during 1992, it was allowed to use the old name of the RSFSR for official business (forms, seals, and stamps).

On April 21, 1992, the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia approved the renaming of the RSFSR into the Russian Federation, by making appropriate amendments to the Constitution, which entered into force

====Post-Soviet transition====
{{See also|History of Russia (1991–present)|1993 Russian constitutional crisis}}
Russia made a significant turn toward developing a market economy by implanting basic tenets such as market-determined prices. Two fundamental and interdependent goals—macroeconomic stabilization and economic restructuring—led the transition from central planning to a market-based economy. The former entailed implementing fiscal and monetary policies that promote economic growth in an environment of stable prices and exchange rates. The latter required establishing the commercial, and institutional entities—banks, private property, and commercial legal codes—that permit the economy to operate efficiently. Opening domestic markets to [[international trade|foreign trade]] and investment, thus linking the economy with the rest of the world, was an important aid in reaching these goals. The Gorbachev regime failed to address these fundamental goals. At the time of the Soviet Union's demise, the Yeltsin government of the Russian Republic had begun to attack the problems of macroeconomic stabilization and economic restructuring. By mid-1996, the results were disastrous, with a 50% decline in GDP and rampant homelessness, unemployment, crime, and poverty.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The struggle for the center of power in post-Soviet Russia and for the nature of the economic reforms culminated in a political crisis and bloodshed in the fall of 1993. Yeltsin, who represented a course of radical privatization, was opposed by the parliament. Confronted with opposition to the presidential power of decree and threatened with impeachment, he "dissolved" the parliament on 21 September, in contravention of the existing constitution, and ordered new elections and a referendum on a new constitution. The parliament then declared Yeltsin deposed and appointed [[Aleksandr Rutskoy]] acting president on 22 September. Tensions built quickly, and matters came to a head after street riots on 2–3 October. On 4 October, Yeltsin ordered Special Forces and elite army units to storm the parliament building, the "White House" as it is called. With tanks thrown against the small-arms fire of the parliamentary defenders, the outcome was not in doubt. Rutskoy, [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], and the other parliamentary supporters surrendered and were immediately arrested and jailed. The official count was 187 dead, 437 wounded (with several men killed and wounded on the presidential side).<ref>{{cite book|title=Afgantsy: the Russians in Afghanistan 1979–89|first=Rodric|last=Braithwaite|publisher=Profile Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84668-054-0|page=312}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Government==
{{Main|Government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic}}
{{See also|List of leaders of the Russian SFSR}}
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}

The Government was known officially as the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (1917–1946) and Council of Ministers (1946–1991). The first government was headed by Vladimir Lenin as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR and the last by Boris Yeltsin as both head of government and head of state under the title of President.

The Russian SFSR was controlled by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], until the abortive 1991 August coup, which prompted President Yeltsin to suspend the recently created [[Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]].

===Autonomous Republics within the Russian SFSR===
* [[Turkestan ASSR]] was formed on 30 April 1918 on the territory of the former [[Russian Turkestan|Turkestan General-Governorate]]. As part of the [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union#National delimitation in Central Asia delimitation|delimitation programme]] of [[Soviet Central Asia]], the Turkestan ASSR along with the [[Khorezm People's Soviet Republic|Khorezm SSR]] and the [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic|Bukharan PSR]] were disbanded on 27 October 1924 and in their place came the Soviet Union republics of [[Turkmen SSR]] and [[Uzbek SSR]]. The latter contained the [[Tajik ASSR]] until December 1929 when it too became a full Union republic, the [[Tajik SSR]]. The RSFSR retained the newly formed [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast|Kara-Kirghiz]] and the [[Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Oblast|Kara-Kalpak]] autonomous oblasts. The latter was part of the Kirgiz, then the Kazak ASSR until 1930 when it was directly subordinated to Moscow.
* [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Bashkir ASSR]] was formed on 23 March 1919 from several northern districts of the [[Orenburg Governorate]] populated by [[Bashkirs]]. On 11 October 1990, it declared its sovereignty, as the Bashkir SSR, which was renamed in 1992 the [[Republic of Bashkortostan]].
* [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tatar ASSR]] was formed on 27 May 1920 on the territory of the western two-thirds of the [[Kazan Governorate]] populated by [[Tatars]]. On 30 October 1990, it declared sovereignty as the [[Republic of Tatarstan]] and on 18 October 1991 declared its independence.

On 19 April 1925, it was renamed as the Kazak ASSR. (see below)
* [[Mountain ASSR]] was formed on 20 January 1921 after the Bolshevik Red Army evicted the short-lived [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]]. Initially composed of several national districts, one-by-one these left the republic until 7 November 1924 when the remains of the republic was partitioned into the [[Ingush Autonomous Oblast]], the [[North Ossetian Autonomous Oblast]] and the [[Sunzha Cossack District]] (all subordinates to the [[North Caucasus Krai]]).
* [[Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Dagestan ASSR]] was formed on 20 January 1921 from the former [[Dagestan Oblast]]. On 17 September 1991, it declared sovereignty as the Dagestan SSR.
* [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean ASSR]] was formed on 18 October 1921 on the territory of [[Crimean peninsula]], following the [[Red Army]]'s eviction of [[Baron Wrangel]]'s army, ending the Russian Civil War in Europe. On 18 May 1944, it was reduced to the status of [[Crimean Oblast|Oblast]] alongside the [[deportation of the Crimean Tatars]] as collective punishment for alleged collaboration with the Nazi occupation regime in [[Taurida Subdistrict]]. On 19 February 1954, it was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred to the Ukrainian SSR]]. Re-established on 12 February 1991, it declared sovereignty on 4 September of that year. On 5 May 1992, it declared independence as the [[Republic of Crimea]]. On 13 May, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] of Ukraine overturned the declaration, but compromised on an [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine. After the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]], a [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russian military intervention]] and a [[2014 Crimean status referendum|disputed referendum]], Crimea was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed by Russia]] in March 2014.
* [[Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Yakut ASSR]] was formed on 16 February 1922 upon the elevation of the [[Yakut Autonomous Oblast]] into an ASSR.

* [[Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Buryat ASSR]] was formed on 30 March 1923 as due to the merger of the [[Mongol-Buryat Autonomous Oblast]] of the RSFSR and the [[Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Far Eastern Republic]]. Until 7 July 1958 – Mongol-Buryat ASSR. On 27 March 1991 it became the [[Republic of Buryatia]].
* [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelian ASSR]] was formed on 23 July 1923 when the [[Karelian Labor Commune]] was integrated into the RSFSR's administrative structure. On 31 March 1940, it was elevated into a full Union republic as the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]]. On 16 July 1956, it was downgraded in status to that of an ASSR and re-subordinated to RSFSR. It declared sovereignty on 13 October 1991 as the [[Republic of Karelia]].
* [[Volga German ASSR]] was formed on 19 December 1924 upon elevation of the [[Volga German Autonomous Oblast]] into an ASSR. On 28 August 1941, upon the deportation of [[Volga Germans]] to Central Asia, the ASSR was disbanded. The territory was partitioned between the [[Saratov Oblast|Saratov]] and [[Volgograd Oblast|Stalingrad Oblasts]].
* [[Kazak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazak ASSR]] was formed on 19 April 1925 when the first [[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1920–25)|Kirghiz ASSR]] was renamed and partitioned. Upon the ratification of the new Soviet constitution, the ASSR was elevated into a full Union Republic on 3 December 1936.

Following the en masse deportation of the [[Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]], on 7 March 1944 the ChIASSR was disbanded and the Grozny Okrug was temporarily administered by [[Stavropol Kray]] until 22 March when the territory was portioned between North Ossetian and Dagestan ASSRs and the Georgian SSR. The remaining land was merged with [[Stavropol Kray]]s Kizlyar district and organised as [[Grozny Oblast]], which existed until 9 January 1957 when the ChIASSR was re-established though only the southern border's original shape was retained.

===National holidays and symbols===
{{Main|Public holidays in Russia|Public holidays in the Soviet Union|Cultural icons of Russia}}
The public holidays for the Russian SFSR included [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[Spring and Labor Day]] (1 May); [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]]; and like all other Soviet republics, the [[October Revolution|Great October Socialist Revolution]] (7 November).

[[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] is the second most popular holiday in Russia as it commemorates the victory over [[Nazism]] in the [[Great Patriotic War]]. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of Russia]], is annually organised in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades take place in all major Russian cities and cities with the status [[Hero City]] or City of Military Glory.

During its 76-year existence, the Russian SFSR anthem was [[Patrioticheskaya Pesnya]], but before 1990 the previous anthem shared its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics and [[The Internationale]] was its anthem before 1944. The [[motto]] "Workers of the world, unite!" was commonly used and shared with other Soviet republics. The [[hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] were still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations until its [[Decommunization in Russia|slow gradual removal in 1991]]. The Soviet [[red star]]s are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The [[Red Banner]] continues to be honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.

The [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of the Russian SFSR (and the Soviet Union as a whole) and the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are Russian SFSR's main architectural icons. The [[Chamomile]] is the [[national flower]] while [[birch]] is the [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal symbol and a [[national personification]] of Russia. Though this image has a Western origin, Russians themselves have accepted it. The native Soviet Russian national personification is [[Mother Russia]].

===Flag history===
{{Main|Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic}}
The flag of the Russian SFSR changed numerous times, with the original being a field of red with the Russian name of the republic written on the flag's centre in white. This flag had always been intended to be temporary, as it was changed less than a year after its adoption. The second flag had the letters РСФСР (RSFSR) written in yellow within the [[Canton (flag)|canton]] and encased within two yellow lines forming a [[right angle]]. The next flag was used from 1937, notably during [[World War II]]. Interesting because it was used until [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death when a major [[Vexillology|vexillological]] reform was undertaken within the Soviet Union. This change incorporated an update for all the [[flags of the Soviet Republics]] as well as for the flag of the Soviet Union itself. The flag of the Russian SFSR was now a [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] version of the [[flag of the Soviet Union]], with the main difference being a minor repositioning of the [[hammer and sickle]] and most notably adding a blue vertical stripe to the [[Hoist (flag)|hoist.]] This version of the flag was used from 1954 all the way to 1991, where it was changed due to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]]. The flag was then changed to a design that resembled the original imperial civil ensign of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], with a notable difference of the flag ratio being 1:2 instead of the original 2:3 ratio. After 1993, when the [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet form of government]] was officially dissolved in the [[Russian Federation]], the final flag of the Russian Federation was changed to the original civil ensign with its original 2:3 proportions.
