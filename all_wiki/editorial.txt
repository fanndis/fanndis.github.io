An '''editorial''', '''leading article''' (US) or '''leader''' (UK), is an article written by the senior editorial staff or publisher of a [[newspaper]], [[magazine]], or any other written document, often unsigned. Australian and major United States newspapers, such as ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/ |title= Opinion |accessdate= 23 May 2012 |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 23 May 2012 |author= Staff}}</ref> and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'',<ref>{{cite news |title= Opinion |url= http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/ |accessdate= 23 May 2012 |newspaper= [[The Boston Globe]] |date= 23 May 2012 |author=Staff}}</ref> often classify editorials under the heading "opinion".

Illustrated editorials may appear in the form of [[editorial cartoons]].<ref>{{cite web |title= AAEC The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists |url= http://editorialcartoonists.com/ |publisher= The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists |accessdate= 23 May 2012 |author= Staff |year= 2012}}</ref>

Typically, a newspaper's [[editorial board]] evaluates which issues are important for their readership to know the newspaper's opinion on.<ref>{{cite book |last= Passante |first= Christopher K. |title= The Complete Idiot's Guide to Journalism – Editorials |publisher= Penguin |year= 2007 |page= 28 |isbn= 978-1-59257-670-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lfh1mufymdsC&q=editorials+%2B+def&pg=PA28 |accessdate= 21 February 2010}}</ref>

Editorials are typically published on a dedicated page, called the editorial page, which often features [[letters to the editor]] from members of the public; the page opposite this page is called the [[op-ed]] page and frequently contains opinion pieces (hence the name '''think pieces''') by writers not directly affiliated with the publication.  However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. In the [[English-language]] press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered especially important; it is more common, however, in some [[Europe]]an countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[France]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.editorsweblog.org/newspaper/2009/06/front-page_editorials_a_stylistic_change.php | title= Front Page Editorials: a Stylist Change for the Future? | author= Christie Silk | date= 15 June 2009 | work= Editors' Weblog | publisher= World Editors' Forum | accessdate= 1 July 2011}}</ref>

Many newspapers publish their editorials without the name of the leader writer. Tom Clark, leader-writer for ''[[The Guardian]]'', says that it ensures that readers discuss the issue at hand rather than the author.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Clark |first1=Tom |title=Why do editorials remain anonymous? |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/10/editorial-leading-article-anonymous |accessdate=26 May 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 January 2011}}</ref> On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crean |first1=Mike |title=First with the news: an illustrated history | date=2011|publisher=[[Random House]] |location=Auckland |isbn=978-1-86979-562-7 |page=97}}</ref>

When ''[[The Press]]'', a New Zealand newspaper based in [[Christchurch]], changed after 157 years from [[broadsheet]] to [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]] in 2018, they published a list of editorials where current thinking differs from opinions expressed at the time. The starkest example was their view on [[women's suffrage in New Zealand]] after the government gave women the [[1893 New Zealand general election|vote in 1893]], where the editorial proclaimed that women would "much prefer staying at home and attending to their household duties" than going to the polling booths.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Matthews |first1=Philip |title=Broadsheets and blunders: In defence of getting it wrong |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/102782748/broadsheets-and-blunders-in-defence-of-getting-it-wrong |accessdate=26 May 2018 |work=[[The Press]] |date=28 April 2018}}</ref>

In the field of [[Fashion magazine|fashion publishing]], the term is often used to refer to ''[[Fashion photography|photo]]''-editorials – features with often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a [[photo-essay]]) without accompanying text.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://models.com/client/editorial | title=Various editorials | website=models.com | accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>
