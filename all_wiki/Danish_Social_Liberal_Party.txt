[[File:Zahle.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Theodor Zahle]] served as the first Social Liberal Prime Minister from 1909–1910 and again from 1913–1920.]]

==Origin==
The party was founded in 1905 as a split from the liberal [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre Reform Party]]. The initial impetus was the expulsion of Venstre's [[antimilitarism|antimilitarist]] wing from the party in January 1905. The expelled members held a founding conference for the new party in [[Odense]], on 21 May 1905. In addition to the differences over military spending, the social liberals also took a more positive view than Venstre towards measures that aimed to reduce [[social inequality]]. The party also became the political leg of the [[Cultural Radicalism|cultural radical]] movement. The party was cautiously open to aspects of the [[welfare state]], and also advocated reforms to improve the position of [[smallholder]]s, an important early group of supporters.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Radical Liberal Party|encyclopedia=The A to Z of Denmark|publisher=Scarecrow Press|editor=Alastair H.

The literal translation "radical left" refers to its origin as the [[Radicalism (historical)|historically radical]] wing of its parent party [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] ("left") In a modern context, this literal translation is somewhat misleading, as the party is in fact at the [[Radical centrism|very centre]] of the Danish [[political spectrum]]. The use of the word for "left" in the name of the party (as with Venstre and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] party [[Venstre (Norway)|Venstre]]) is meant to refer to [[liberalism in Denmark|liberalism]] and not modern [[left-wing politics]]. Venstre originally was to the left of the [[conservatism in Denmark|conservative]] and [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[right-wing]] party [[Højre]], which means "right".

==History==

=== 1905–1930s ===
The first Social Liberal Cabinet was formed in 1909 with [[Carl Theodor Zahle]] serving as Prime Minister (1909–1910). From 1913–1920, Zahle led the second Social Liberal Cabinet with the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] serving as parliamentary support, keeping Denmark neutral during [[World War I]]. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the party served as coalition partners along with the Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister [[Thorvald Stauning]], and managed to lead the country through the recession by implementing far-reaching social reforms.<ref name=":0" />

=== Post World War II ===
After 1945 the party continued with its pragmatic ways, influencing either as coalition partner as parliamentary support. From 1957–1964 they served as coalition partners in a Social Democratic led government, while [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] served as Prime Minister 1968–1971 in a coalition government with [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] as partners. In the [[1968 Danish general election|1968 general elections]] the party reached an all-time high of 15% of the vote, while they only received 11.2% in the [[1973 Danish general election|1973 landslide election]].

During the 1980s the party served either as parliamentary support or as coalition partner in various Venstre led governments.

After an all-time low in the [[1990 Danish general election|1990 general elections]] where the party only received 3.5% of the vote, the party once again started cooperating with the Social Democrats under leadership of [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]], participating in a coalition government in 1993.<ref name=":0" />

=== 2001–present ===
In the early 2000s the political scene was marked by "bloc"-politics, with "blue bloc" being led by Venstre and "red bloc" by the Social Democrats. The [[Danish People's Party]] overtook the Social Liberals' key position as prime candidate for parliamentary support. Furthermore, the DPP's anti-immigrant policies made the Social Liberals profile themselves as a progressive party being pro-globalisation, pro-EU and more tolerant towards refugees and immigrants. At the same time the party profiled itself on reforming the welfare system, campaigning to abolish "efterløn" and lower taxes. As such the party served to unite a modern social profile with a more liberal economic profile. This served to appeal the more well-educated urbanised parts of the country, resulting in 9.2% of the vote at the [[2005 Danish general election|2005 general elections]].<ref name=":0" />

In a 2006 press release they tried to mark themselves as once again being able to lead a government, doing away with the presumption of the party only being able to serve as government partner or parliamentary support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berlingske.dk/content/item/772213|title=De Radikales frihedsbrev|last=Larsen|first=Thomas|date=2005-04-10|website=Berlingske.dk|language=da|access-date=2019-06-15}}</ref> The strategy proved unpopular both among voters and within the party itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berlingske.dk/content/item/821833|title=»Verden forandrer sig - det har de Radikale opdaget«|last=Petersen|first=Sami Don|date=2006-07-23|website=Berlingske.dk|language=da|access-date=2019-06-15}}</ref> On 7 May 2007 MP [[Naser Khader]] and MEP [[Anders Samuelsen]] left the party and formed the New Alliance, known today as the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]], along with Conservative MEP [[Gitte Seeberg]].<ref name=":0" /> At a press conference on 15 June 2007, it was announced that MP [[Margrethe Vestager]] would take over leadership of the party after [[Marianne Jelved]], and that the party would rethink its strategy. The party returned to its historical role as possible coalition partner and at the political centre of Danish politics.<ref name="vestager">Haahr, Ulla (15 June 2007). [http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2007/06/15/110511.htm ''Vestager ny radikal dronning''] {{in lang|da}}. [[Danmarks Radio]]. Retrieved 11 December 2007.</ref> Vestager clarified during the run-up to the [[2007 Danish general election|2007 general election]] that her party would only be supporting a government led by the Social Democrats. Still, the party only won 5.1% of the vote.

At the subsequent [[2011 Danish parliamentary election|2011 general elections]], the party support rose to 9.5% and regained 8 seats to resume a total of 17. Together with the Social Democrats and the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], they formed a [[Thorning-Schmidt I Cabinet|three-way government coalition]].

On 31 August 2014, Prime Minister [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] nominated Margrethe Vestager as Denmark's [[European Commissioner|EU Commissioner]], resulting in her resignation as party leader. The party's parliamentary group subsequently elected [[Morten Østergaard]] as new leader.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radikale.dk/content/morten-%C3%B8stergaard-er-ny-politisk-leder-af-radikale-venstre|title=Morten Østergaard er ny politisk leder af Radikale Venstre|date=2014-08-31|website=Radikale Venstre|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>

At the [[2015 Danish parliamentary election|2015 general elections]], the party lost 9 out of 17 seats and was reduced to 4.6%. The party lost a share of its voters to the newly formed [[The Alternative (Denmark)|The Alternative]], a [[Green politics|green]] political party formed by former member of the party [[Uffe Elbæk]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berlingske.dk/content/item/93687|title=Her kommer Alternativets vælgere fra|last=Winther|first=Bent|date=2015-06-08|website=Berlingske.dk|language=da|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>

At the [[2019 Danish general election|2019 general elections]], the party rose to 8.6% of the vote, doubling its number of seats to 16. Østergaard stated that he would support a government led by the Social Democrats only if changes would be made to the previous government's strict immigration policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/folketingsvalg/radikale-kraever-lempelser-i-udlaendingepolitikken-vil-give|title=Radikale kræver lempelser i udlændingepolitikken: Vil give statsborgerskab i 18 års-fødselsdagsgave|last=Jørgensen|first=Anna Sol|date=2019-05-24|website=DR|language=da-DK|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>

On 7 October 2020 Morten Østergaard stepped down as leader of the party following allegations of sexual harassment from within the party. [[Sofie Carsten Nielsen]] was elected new leader the same day.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-07|title=Morten Østergaard trækker sig efter sag om krænkelser|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/morten-oestergaard-traekker-sig-efter-sag-om-kraenkelser|access-date=2020-10-07|website=DR|language=da-DK}}</ref>
