{{Politics of Hong Kong}}

The '''pro-democracy camp''' refers to a political alignment in [[Hong Kong]] that supports increased democracy, namely the [[universal suffrage]] of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] as given by the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]] under the "[[One Country, Two Systems]]" framework.

The pro-democrats generally embrace [[liberalism|liberal]] values such as rule of law, human rights, civil liberties and social justice, though their economic positions vary. They are often referred to as the "opposition camp" as they have consistently been the minority camp within the Legislative Council, and because of their non-cooperative and sometimes confrontational stance towards the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[Central People's Government|Chinese central governments]]. Opposite to the pro-democracy camp is the [[Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong)|pro-Beijing camp]], whose members are perceived as being supportive of the Beijing and SAR authorities. Since the [[Handover of Hong Kong|1997 handover]], the pro-democracy camp has usually received 55 to 60 percent of the votes in each election, but has always received less than half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] due to the [[indirectly elected]] elements of the legislature.

The pro-democracy activists emerged from the youth movements in the 1970s and began to take part in electoral politics as the colonial government introduced representative democracy in the mid 1980s. The pro-democrats joined hands in pushing for greater democracy both in the transition period and after [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong]] in 1997. Many also supported greater democracy in China and the [[Tiananmen Square protest of 1989]]. The relationship between the pro-democrats and the Beijing government turned hostile after Beijing's bloody crackdown on the protest, after which the pro-democrats were labelled as "treasonous". After the [[2004 Hong Kong legislative election|2004 Legislative Council election]], the term "pan-democracy camp" (abbreviated "pan-dems") became more commonly used as more allied parties and politicians of varying political ideologies emerged.

In the [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 Legislative Council election]], the camp faced a challenge from the new [[localist groups (Hong Kong)|localists]] who emerged after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] and ran under the banner of [[self-determination]] or [[Hong Kong independence]]. After the election, some localists joined the pro-democrats' caucus, which rebranded itself as the "pro-democracy camp".<ref name="G27">{{cite news|title=非建制「G27」共商大計 溝通平台擬正名「民主派會議」|url=http://news.mingpao.com/pns/dailynews/web_tc/article/20161008/s00002/1475864414187|newspaper=Ming Pao|date=7 October 2016|access-date=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008173811/http://news.mingpao.com/pns/dailynews/web_tc/article/20161008/s00002/1475864414187|archive-date=8 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The disunity within the camp and the failure of the Umbrella Revolution cost the pro-democrats in the [[2018 Hong Kong by-election|2018 by-elections]]. The [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|2019 anti-extradition movement]], however, saw a rebound in popularity for the camp, which contributed to its biggest victory in the history of Hong Kong, gaining control of 17 of the 18 District Councils and more than tripling their seats from 124 to 388 in the [[2019 Hong Kong local elections|2019 District Council election]]. In reaction to the political upheaval, the Beijing government further curbed the opposition and the disqualification of four sitting pro-democracy legislators triggered the resignations of all 19 remaining pro-democrats from the legislature, leaving pro-democrats with no representation for the first time since 1998.<ref name="bbc_resign_en_masse"/>

== Ideology ==
{{see also|Democratic development in Hong Kong|Liberalism in Hong Kong}}
One of the main goals of the pro-democracy camp is to achieve [[universal suffrage]] of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] (CE) and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) as guaranteed in [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|Article 45]] and Article 68 of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]] respectively. Since the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]]'s (NPCSC) [[831 decision|31 August 2014 decision]], which determined that the Chief Executive candidate would be selected by a highly restrictive nominating committee and was seen as betrayal of the democratic value, some democrats have raised the question of the [[right of self-determination|right to self-determination]]. However, the mainstream pro-democrats retained their support for a highly autonomous Hong Kong under the "[[One Country, Two Systems]]" framework, as promised by the Basic Law.<ref name="The New York Times">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/world/asia/hong-kong-elections.html |title=China Restricts Voting Reforms for Hong Kong |work=The New York Times |date=31 August 2014 |access-date=31 August 2014 |author1=Buckley, Chris |author2=Forsythe, Michael |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6VtIesi1F?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/world/asia/hong-kong-elections.html?_r=0 |archive-date=27 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The pro-democrats generally embrace [[Liberalism|liberal]] values such as rule of law, human rights, civil liberties, and social justice, though their economic positions vary. Some pro-democrats position themselves as more pro-labour, such as the [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD), the [[Labour Party (Hong Kong)|Labour Party]], and the [[Neighbourhood and Worker's Service Centre]] (NWSC). Meanwhile, most pro-democrats believe in a more [[egalitarian]] society. The pro-democracy camp generally supports the [[Chinese democracy movement]], which can be traced back to their support for the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. Many of the pro-democrats have been calling for the end of [[one party rule]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] and therefore are seen as a threat by the Beijing authorities. The camp's support for more ''western-style'' liberal democracy is seen as unacceptable by the Beijing government. In some cases, pan-democracy activists have been accused of [[high treason]] and labeled as "[[traitors]] to Han Chinese".<ref>Jensen, Lionel M. Weston, Timothy B. [2006] (2006). China's Transformations: The Stories Beyond the Headlines. Rowman & Littlefield. {{ISBN|0-7425-3863-X}}.</ref>

The pro-democrats are also divided by their approach for achieving democracy: the moderate democrats, represented by the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]] (ADPL), believe in dialogue with Beijing and Hong Kong governments over struggle, while radical democrats such as the League of Social Democrats and the [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] believe in street actions and mass movements. There have been severe conflicts and distrust between the two factions and a great split after the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|constitutional reform voting]] in 2010, where the Democratic Party negotiated with the Beijing representatives and supported the modified reform proposal and was thus seen as a betrayal by the radical democrats.<ref>{{Cite news |title=A more united Democratic Party predicted as Young Turks leave |newspaper=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |date=20 December 2010 }}</ref>

== History ==
=== Early development ===
Members of the camp include social workers and social activists emerged from the 1970s youth movements. Many of them grouped themselves as the "social action faction", competing against the pro-Communist [[Maoists]] in whom they disagreed with their ultra-nationalist and radical Maoist stances. Although claiming to be patriotic and launching the [[Baodiao movement|defend the Diaoyu Islands movement]], the "social action faction" dedicated themselves into the local social issues in Hong Kong. They fought for the social inequality and livelihood issues, including the anti-corruption movement and Chinese Language movement and so forth. In the early 1980s when the question of Hong Kong sovereignty emerged, many of them supported a democratic autonomous Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty, notably the [[Meeting Point]] which was founded in January 1983 which became the first political group to publicly support the Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite book|title=Political Change and the Crisis of Legitimacy in Hong Kong|last=Scott|first=Ian|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=210}}</ref>

After the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], the pro-democrats began to join hands to demand further democracy before and after 1997. In 1986, a number of political groups, activists, professionals and politicians joined hand under the banner of the [[Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government]] (JCPDG) demanding for [[1988 Hong Kong legislative election|1988 direct elections]] for the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and earlier [[universal suffrage]] for the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] and Legislative Council after 1997, as presented in the proposal of the [[Group of 190]].<ref name="dictionary">{{cite book|title=Political Dictionary for Hong Kong|location=Hong Kong|year=1990|publisher=Macmillan Publishers (HK) Ltd|author1-first=Stephen|author1-last=Davies|author2-first=Elfed|author2-last=Roberts}}</ref> Their arch rival at the time was the [[Group of 89]], a group of conservative business and professional elites in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee]] (HKBLDC) and [[Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee]] (HKBLCC). They generally opposed the British colonial administration and its perceived "[[kowtowing]]" to the Beijing government over the issues such as constitutional reform, direct elections, civic rights and [[Daya Bay Nuclear Plant]].<ref name="dictionary"/>

The pro-democrats maintained a relatively warm relationship with the Beijing government during the 1980s, as many of the pro-democrats supported the Chinese sovereignty in Hong Kong and the "high degree of autonomy" as ensured in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. They also saw the ideal of Hong Kong helping in China's [[Four Modernisations]].<ref name="dictionary"/> The Beijing authorities also viewed the pro-democrats as the targets of the [[PRC United Front strategy|united front]]. Barrister [[Martin Lee]] and educator [[Szeto Wah]], president of the [[Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union]], who were also the two most visible pro-democracy leaders, were appointed members of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee in 1985 by Beijing.<ref>{{cite book|title=Underground front|last=Loh|first=Christine|year=2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=158}}</ref>

The pro-democrats also participated in electoral politics as direct elections were introduced in local levels in the 1980s, namely the [[District Council of Hong Kong|District Boards]], [[Urban Council]] and [[Regional Council (Hong Kong)|Regional Council]]. Among them, the Meeting Point formed in 1983, the [[Hong Kong Affairs Society]] in 1985 and [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]] in 1986 became the three major pro-democratic groups and formed a strategic alliance in the [[1988 Hong Kong local elections|1988 District Board elections]], which laid the foundation of the pro-democracy grassroots supports.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Politics of Democratization in Hong Kong|last=Lo|first=Shiu-hing|pages=143–145|year=2016|publisher= Springer}}</ref>

=== Tiananmen protests and last colonial years ===
The consolidation of its public support has its roots in opposition to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen crackdown]] which aroused widespread horror, sympathy and support of the protesters by Hong Kong citizens.<ref name="Wingk">Wing-kai Chiu, Stephen. Lui, Tai-Lok. The Dynamics of Social Movement in Hong Kong. [2000] (2000). Hong Kong University Press. {{ISBN|962-209-497-X}}.</ref> The pro-democrats, who were heavily involved in the protests and formed the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China]] (ADSPDMC or Alliance), were seen as "treason" and threat to the Beijing government. The two pro-democracy Basic Law Drafting Committee members, Martin Lee and Szeto Wah, were stripped from the office after they resigned in protest of the bloody crackdown, many of other pro-democrats were denied entry to the Mainland China since. Since 1989, the Alliance organise [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|annual candlelight vigil]] for the June 4 crackdown at the [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong]], which draw thousands of people every year. Ahead of the [[1991 Hong Kong legislative election|first direct election to the Legislative Council in 1991]], around 600 democracy activists co-founded the first major pro-democracy party, the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Challenge of Hong Kong's Reintegration with China: Modern Diasporic Femininity|first=Ming K.|last=Chan|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=1997}}</ref><ref name="Sing">{{cite book|title=Hong Kong's Tortuous Democratization: A Comparative Analysis|first=Ming|last=Sing|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref>

The electoral alliance of United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting Point, together with other smaller political parties, groups and independents, won a historical landslide victory in the 1991 election, took 17 out of the 18 geographical constituency seats.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hkjo.lib.hku.hk/archive/files/9a143dfa460b1378f2b447a98a057d8e.pdf|journal=Asian Journal of Public Administration|first=Ian|last=Scott|title=An Overview of the Hong Kong Legislative Council Elections of 1991|volume=13|number=2|year=1991|pages=11–37|doi=10.1080/02598272.1991.10800247}}</ref> The pro-democrats were often considered strategic allies of [[Chris Patten]], the last [[governor of Hong Kong|colonial governor]] who proposed a [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|much progressive democratic reform]] in the last years before the [[handover of Hong Kong]], despite Beijing's strong opposition. The Democrats supported Patten's proposal for the [[1995 Hong Kong legislative election|1995 Legislative Council election]]. However, [[Emily Lau]]'s full-scale direct election amendment was not passed as a result of Meeting Point's abstaining from voting for Emily Lau, which caused harsh criticism from the radical democrats and the [[United Ants]].<ref name="Sing"/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Dynamics of Social Movement in Hong Kong|first1=Stephen Wing-Kai|last1=Chiu|first2=Dale|last2=Lü|first3=Tai-Lok|last3=Lui|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2000|page=43}}</ref> In 1994, the United Democrats and the Meeting Point merged into the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]], which won another landslide victory in the 1995 election, taking 19 seats in total, far ahead of other parties. Together with other democratic parties and individuals including Emily Lau, [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] and [[Leung Yiu-chung]] who later formed [[The Frontier (Hong Kong)|The Frontier]] in 1996 and [[Christine Loh]] who formed the [[Citizens Party (Hong Kong)|Citizens Party]] in 1997, the pro-democrats gained a thin majority in the legislature for the last two years before 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Save Our Harbour |url=http://www.citizensparty.org/save_our_harbour1.html |work=The Citizens Party |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991109235018/http://www.citizensparty.org/save_our_harbour1.html |archive-date=9 November 1999 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PAST POLITICAL RECORD - CHRISTINE KUNG-WAI LOH |url=http://www.citizensparty.org/eclppr.html |work=The Citizens Party |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991003224637/http://www.citizensparty.org/eclppr.html |archive-date=3 October 1999 }}</ref>

The Beijing government argued that the electoral reform introduced by Patten had violated the Joint Declaration and thus they no longer felt obliged to honour the promise of a "through train", a plan to keep the 1995 elected legislature into post-handover SAR era. A parallel Legislative Council, the [[Provisional Legislative Council]], was formed in 1996 under the control of the Pro-Beijing camp, this became the Legislative Council upon the founding of the new SAR government in 1997, in which the pro-democrats except for the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood boycotted it, deeming it as unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite book|title=Underground front |last=Loh |first=Christine |year=2010 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |page=187}}</ref>

=== Handover to China and 1 July 2003 protest ===
All of its members, except the [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]], declined to join the extralegal Provisional Legislative Council installed by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]], and were ousted from the territory's legislature for a year until the 1998 election.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Concise History of Hong Kong|first=John Mark|last=Carroll|page=202|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2007}}</ref> Starting from the 1998 election, since the [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] electoral system was changed to [[proportional representation]], compounded with the restoration of corporate votes in the functional constituencies, and replacement of broad-based functional constituencies with traditional ones, the number of seats of the camp dipped, albeit having similar share of vote.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hong Kong's Tortuous Democratization: A Comparative Analysis|first=Ming|last=Sing|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|page=158}}</ref> Within the camp, share of smaller parties and independents increased relatively, with the share of the Democratic Party falling from around two-thirds in 1995 to less than a half by 2004.

The pro-democracy camp was the strong opposition to the [[National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003|national security and anti-subversion legislation]] of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Basic Law Article 23]] and they successfully called for [[Hong Kong July 1 marches#2003|over 500,000 people to protest]] on 1 July 2003 against the legislation, the largest demonstration since the handover.<ref name="Wyc">Wong, Yiu-Chung.

=== 2012 reform package and the Split ===
[[Donald Tsang]], the Chief Executive, promised to resolve the question of universal suffrage in his office during the election. He carried out the [[2012 constitutional package]] in 2009 which was criticised by the pro-democracy as lack of genuine progress. The League of Social Democrats called for a ''[[de facto]]'' [[referendum]], by way of the [[2010 Hong Kong by-election|2010 by-elections]] in five geographical constituencies.<ref>Associated Press (11 March 2010), [http://us.asiancorrespondent.com/breakingnews/hong-kong-china-debate-legality-of-.htm "Hong Kong, China debate legality of referendum"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411001011/http://us.asiancorrespondent.com/breakingnews/hong-kong-china-debate-legality-of-.htm |date=11 April 2010 }}, Asian Correspondent.

However, it triggered a major split within the camp and also in the Democratic Party. The Young Turks including the LegCo member [[Andrew Cheng]] quit the party and formed the [[Neo Democrats]]. The Democratic Party was accused by the LSD and the radicals of betraying democracy and its supporters. On the matter of whether to coordinate with the moderate democrats in the [[2011 Hong Kong local elections|2011 District Council elections]], the League of Social Democrats was suffered in the factional fighting and the two of the three LSD legislators left the party in disarray and formed the [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chinaelectionsblog.net/hkfocus/?p=192|title=Politicking Hong Kong Style|last=Pepper|first=Suzanne|date=15 November 2010|access-date=3 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106230747/http://chinaelectionsblog.net/hkfocus/?p=192|archive-date=6 January 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The People Power's campaign targeted pan-democracy parties in the 2011 District Council elections that had supported the reform package filled candidates to run against them but only won one seat of 62 contested.

===2014 Umbrella Revolution===
In March 2013, all 27 democratic legislators formed the [[Alliance for True Democracy]] (ATD), replacing the Alliance for Universal Suffrage, to show solidarity of the camp to fight for genuine democracy. The ATD put forward a three-channel proposal for the [[2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2017 Chief Executive election]] during the [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|constitutional reform consultation]] in 2014. However, the decision of the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) on 31 August ruled out the possibility for any candidate not endorsed by Beijing to be nominated for the election, which the pan-democrats accused as a betrayal of the principle of "one person, one vote," The pan-democrats had supported legal scholar [[Benny Tai]]'s [[Occupy Central with Love and Peace|Occupy Central]] plan of civil disobedience against Beijing's decision, which later turned into a [[2014 Hong Kong protests|79-day occupy protest]] which often dubbed as "Umbrella Revolution".<ref name="The New York Times"/> On 18 June 2015, all 27 pan-democrat legislators and [[Medical (constituency)|Medical]] legislator [[Leung Ka-lau]] voted against the government's constitutional reform bill while the pro-Beijing legislators launched a failed walk-out. The bill was defeated by 28 against 8 for, barely meeting the quorum of 35.<ref>{{cite news|work=ejinsight|first=Hang-chi|last=Lam|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20150618-and-so-we-stagger-into-an-even-more-uncertain-future/|date=18 June 2015|title=And so, we stagger into an even more uncertain future|access-date=17 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929231512/http://www.ejinsight.com/20150618-and-so-we-stagger-into-an-even-more-uncertain-future/|archive-date=29 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Many new political groups emerged from the Umbrella Revolution often distanced themselves from the pan-democrats. Many of whom, being labelled as "[[localism in Hong Kong|localists]]", criticised pan-democrats' failing in achieving democracy in the last 30 years. Many of them called for more "militant" tactics over pan-democrats' "non-violent" principles and "China–Hong Kong separation" over the some mainstream pan-democrats' mild "Chinese nationalist sentiment".<ref name="Lau">{{cite news|title=Independent thinker Horace Chin treads bold path|first=Stuart|last=Lau|date=10 June 2013|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1257295/independent-thinker-horace-chin-treads-bold-path|newspaper=South China Morning Post|access-date=9 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915174355/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1257295/independent-thinker-horace-chin-treads-bold-path|archive-date=15 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Some of them also criticised pan-democrats' demand of the vindication of the 1989 Tiananmen protests, as pursued by the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China]] (HKASPDMC). There was also growing voice for [[Hong Kong independence]] from the Chinese rule, as many of whom deemed the "One Country, Two Systems" had failed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Makes History with First Pro-Independence Rally|first=Liam|last=Fitzpatrick|work=TIME|url=http://time.com/4440708/hong-kong-independence-china-localist/|access-date=9 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706221647/http://time.com/4440708/hong-kong-independence-china-localist/|archive-date=6 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Continued division and anti-extradition protests===
In the [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 Legislative Council election]], [[localist groups (Hong Kong)|localists]] with different banners together took away 19 per cent of the vote share from the pan-democrats, in which the traditional pan-democrats secured only 36 per cent, 21 less than the previous election. The non-establishment forces secured 30 out of the 70 seats, in which pan-democrats took 23 seats. After the election, the 27-member pro-democrats' caucus rebranded themselves into "pro-democracy camp" or "G27", as three backers of the "self-determination" of Hong Kong, namely [[Nathan Law]], [[Lau Siu-lai]] and [[Eddie Chu]] joined the caucus.<ref name="G27"/> The "G27" soon became "G26" after Chu left the caucus shortly afterwards.

In the [[2016 Hong Kong Election Committee Subsector elections|2016 Election Committee subsector election]], the pro-democrat coalition "Democrats 300+" scored a record victory in the [[Election Committee]] which was responsible for electing the [[2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2017 Chief Executive]]. The democrats decided not to field their candidate in order to boost the chance of an alternative establishment candidate against incumbent [[Leung Chun-ying]]. After Leung announced he would not seek for re-election, the pro-democrats turned against [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] [[Carrie Lam]] who was seen as "C.Y. 2.0". The pro-democrats nominated former [[Financial Secretary of Hong Kong|Financial Secretary]] [[John Tsang]] and retired judge [[Woo Kwok-hing]] amid the [[Liaison Office (Hong Kong)|Liaison Office]] actively lobbied for Lam. Ahead of the election, some 98 per cent of the "Democrats 300+" coalition decided on voting for Tsang as he was the most popular candidate in the polls.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pan-democrats pledge more than 290 votes for John Tsang in Hong Kong leadership race|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2080573/pan-democrats-promise-more-290-votes-john-tsang-hong-kong|date=20 March 2017|newspaper=South China Morning Post|access-date=26 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030055/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2080573/pan-democrats-promise-more-290-votes-john-tsang-hong-kong|archive-date=24 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 14 July 2017, [[Leung Kwok-hung]] of the [[League of Social Democrats]], Nathan Law of the [[Demosisto]], [[Yiu Chung-yim]] and Lau Siu-lai were unseated from the Legislative Council over [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|their manners at the oath-taking ceremony]] at the inaugural meeting as a result of the legal action from the Leung Chun-ying government and the interpretation of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] by the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC), following the disqualification of two pro-independence legislators, [[Youngspiration]]'s [[Baggio Leung]] and [[Yau Wai-ching]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Four More Hong Kong Lawmakers Ousted In a Blow to Democratic Hopes|url=http://time.com/4856181/hong-kong-lawmakers-oath-china-disqualified/|work=TIME|date=17 July 2017|access-date=18 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928121835/http://time.com/4856181/hong-kong-lawmakers-oath-china-disqualified/|archive-date=28 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The pro-democrats suffered a defeat in the [[2018 Hong Kong by-election|by-election]] for four of the six vacancies on 11 March 2018, losing the [[Kowloon West (constituency)|Kowloon West]] geographical constituency and [[Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape (constituency)|Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape]] functional constituency to the pro-Beijing candidates. Yiu Ching-yim who contested in Kowloon West was defeated by [[Vincent Cheng (DAB politician)|Vincent Cheng]] of the DAB with a thin margin, making it the first time a pro-democrat lost in a [[single-member district]] election since the handover. The vote share of the pro-democrats also dropped from the traditional 55 per cent to only 47 per cent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong democrats to rely on legal appeals after failing to win back Legco veto foothold|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2136762/pan-democrats-look-set-regain-power-veto-rivals-moves-hong|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=12 March 2018|access-date=17 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316142839/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2136762/pan-democrats-look-set-regain-power-veto-rivals-moves-hong|archive-date=16 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The pro-democrats fiercely opposed the [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill|amendment to the extradition law]] in 2019 which they feared the erosion of Hong Kong's legal system and its built-in safeguards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-extradition-idUSKCN1TB08W|title=Hong Kong pushes bill allowing extraditions to China despite...|date=10 June 2019|agency=Reuters|access-date=10 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610041916/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-extradition-idUSKCN1TB08W|archive-date=10 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The opposition led to the [[2019 Hong Kong protests|historic massive protests]] throughout the latter half of the year. Riding on the anti-government sentiments, the pro-democracy camp achieved its biggest landslide victory in the history of Hong Kong in the [[2019 Hong Kong local elections|2019 District Council election]], gaining control of 17 of the 18 District Councils and tripling their seats from around 124 to about 388. The pro-democrats were also able to capture 117 District Council subsector seats in the 1,200-member Election Committee, which is responsible for electing the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Pro-Beijing parties and independents won from around 300 to only 62 seats, a loss of nearly 80%.<ref name="auto2">{{cite news|title=Hong Kong voters deliver landslide victory for pro-democracy campaigners|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers|work=The Guardian|date=24 November 2019|access-date=29 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191125014152/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers|archive-date=25 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="auto3">{{cite news |title=Hong Kong Election Results Give Democracy Backers Big Win |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/world/asia/hong-kong-election-results.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=25 November 2019 |ref=pro-democracy candidates captured 389 of 452 elected seats, up from only 124 and far more than they have ever won. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191125064446/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/world/asia/hong-kong-election-results.html |archive-date=25 November 2019 |url-status=live |date=24 November 2019 |last1=Bradsher |first1=Keith |last2=Ramzy |first2=Austin |last3=May |first3=Tiffany }}</ref>

=== 2020 resignation en masse ===
The [[Hong Kong national security law]] promulgated by the NPCSC in June 2020 gave sweeping power to the Hong Kong government to suppress the opposition whoever was perceived as the "threat of the national security". In the [[postponement of the 2020 Hong Kong legislative election|subsequently postponed Legislative Council election]] in September 2020, 12 pro-democracy and localist candidates were disqualified by the returning officers for breaching the national security law, including three Civic Party incumbent legislators [[Alvin Yeung]], [[Kwok Ka-ki]] and [[Dennis Kwok]], as well as [[Kenneth Leung]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53593187|title=Hong Kong bars 12 opposition candidates from election|date=30 July 2020|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The pro-democracy camp was divided whether to stay in the extended legislative term or to quit as they deemed as unlawful. At the end 19 of the 21 pro-democrats remained in the Legislative Council.<ref>{{cite news|title=Most of Hong Kong's opposition lawmakers to serve out extended term in Legislative Council, after supporters narrowly back move in poll|date=29 September 2020|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3103434/hong-kong-opposition-poll-shows-supporters-narrowly-back}}</ref>

When in November 2020 the NPCSC, applying national security law to disqualify the four sitting legislators whose candidacies were perviously invalidated, the pro-democrat convenor and the Democratic Party chairman [[Wu Chi-wai]] announced the remaining 15 pro-democracy legislators were to resign en masse in protest to the decision, declaring the death of the "One Country, Two Systems" and separation of power in Hong Kong. The mass resignations left virtually no opposition in the Legislative Council.<ref name="bbc_resign_en_masse">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54899171 |title=Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers resign after China ruling |date=November 11, 2020 |website=BBC |access-date=November 11, 2020 }}</ref><ref name="yp_scmp_en_masse">{{cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/yp/discover/news/hong-kong/article/3109427/hong-kong-opposition-lawmakers-quit-over-beijing |title=Hong Kong opposition lawmakers quit over Beijing resolution |date=November 11, 2020 |website=SCMP Young Post |access-date=November 11, 2020 }}</ref><ref name="yp_scmp_desqualified">{{cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/yp/discover/news/hong-kong/article/3109365/four-hong-kong-opposition-lawmakers-disqualified-after |title=Four Hong Kong opposition lawmakers disqualified after ruling from Beijing |date=November 11, 2020 |website=SCMP Young Post |access-date=November 11, 2020 }}</ref>
