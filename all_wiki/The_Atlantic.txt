'''''The Atlantic''''' is an American magazine and multi-platform publisher. It was founded in 1857 in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, as '''''The Atlantic Monthly''''',  a literary and cultural commentary magazine that published leading writers' commentary on the [[Antislavery Movement In America|abolition of slavery]], education, and other major political issues of that time. Its founders included [[Francis H. Underwood]]<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Essay|author=Chevalier, Tracy |date= 2012|title=The Atlantic Monthly American magazine, 1857}} "The Atlantic Monthly was founded in Boston in 1857 by Francis Underwood (an assistant to the publisher..."</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A History of the Atlantic Monthly, 1857–1909|author=Sedgwick, Ellery |date= 2009|page=3}}</ref> and prominent writers [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], and [[John Greenleaf Whittier]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier|author=Whittier, John Greenleaf|volume= 2|date= 1975 |page=318}} "... however, was the founding of the Atlantic Monthly in 1857.

==Early years==
[[File:James Russell Lowell - 1855.jpg|[[James Russell Lowell]], first editor|thumb]]
In the autumn of 1857, Boston publisher [[Moses Dresser Phillips]] created ''The Atlantic Monthly''. This plan was launched in a dinner-party, as described in a letter by Phillips:
<blockquote>I must tell you about a little dinner-party I gave about two weeks ago. It would be proper, perhaps, to state the origin of it was a desire to confer with my literary friends on a somewhat extensive literary project, the particulars of which I shall reserve till you come. But to the Party: My invitations included only [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|R. W. Emerson]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|H. W. Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell|J. R. Lowell]], [[John Lothrop Motley|Mr. Motley]] (the 'Dutch Republic' man), [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|O. W. Holmes]], [[James Elliot Cabot|Mr. Cabot]], and [[Francis H. Underwood|Mr. Underwood]], our literary man. Imagine your uncle as the head of such a table, with such guests. The above named were the only ones invited, and they were all present. We sat down at three P.M., and rose at eight. The time occupied was longer by about four hours and thirty minutes than I am in the habit of consuming in that kind of occupation, but it was the richest time intellectually by all odds that I have ever had. Leaving myself and 'literary man' out of the group, I think you will agree with me that it would be difficult to duplicate that number of such conceded scholarship in the whole country besides.... Each one is known alike on both sides of the Atlantic, and is read beyond the limits of the English language.<ref name="Hale1898">''James Russell Lowell and His Friends'', by [[Edward Everett Hale]], Houghton Mifflin & Co., 1898, pages 154-159.</ref></blockquote>

At that dinner he announced his idea for a magazine:
<blockquote>Mr. Cabot is much wiser than I am. Dr. Holmes can write funnier verses than I can. Mr. Motley can write history better than I. Mr. Emerson is a philosopher and I am not. Mr. Lowell knows more of the old poets than I. But none of you knows the American people as well as I do.<ref name="Hale1898" /></blockquote>

''The Atlantic''{{'}}s first issue was published in November 1857, and quickly gained fame as one of the finest magazines in the English-speaking world.

==Literary history==
[[File:Battle Hymn of the Republic.jpg|right|thumb|First publication of "Battle Hymn of the Republic"]]
A leading literary magazine, ''The Atlantic'' has published many significant works and authors. It was the first to publish pieces by the abolitionists [[Julia Ward Howe]] ("[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" on February 1, 1862), and [[William Parker (abolitionist)|William Parker]], whose [[slave narrative]], "The Freedman's Story" was published in February and March 1866. It also published [[Charles W. Eliot]]'s "The New Education", a call for practical reform, that led to his appointment to presidency of [[Harvard University]] in 1869; works by [[Charles Chesnutt]] before he collected them in ''[[The Conjure Woman]]'' (1899); and poetry and short stories, helping launch many national literary careers.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} For example, [[Emily Dickinson]], after reading an article in ''The Atlantic'' by [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], asked him to become her mentor.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In 2005, the magazine won a National Magazine Award for fiction.<ref>{{cite web|title = Esquire Wins 2005 National Magazine Award|url = http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/esquire-wins-2005-national-magazine-award|date = April 13, 2005}}</ref>
[[File:1873 AtlanticMonthly TremontSt Boston.png|thumb|left|''Atlantic Monthly'' office, Ticknor & Fields, 124 Tremont Street, Boston, c. 1868<ref>''Boston Directory'', 1868.</ref>]]
The magazine published many of the works of [[Mark Twain]], including one that was lost until 2001.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Editors have recognized major cultural changes and movements. For example, of the emerging writers of the 1920s, [[Ernest Hemingway]] had his short story "[[Fifty Grand]]" published in the July 1927 edition. Harkening back to its abolitionist roots, in its August 1963 edition, at the height of the [[civil rights movement]], the magazine published [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s defense of [[civil disobedience]], "[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/04/martin-luther-kings-letter-from-birmingham-jail/274668/|title=Martin Luther King's 'Letter From Birmingham Jail'|author=The Editors|date=April 16, 2013|work=The Atlantic|volume=212|number=2|pages=78–88|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202162541/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/04/martin-luther-kings-letter-from-birmingham-jail/274668/|archive-date=December 2, 2017}}</ref>

The magazine has published speculative articles that inspired the development of new technologies. The classic example is [[Vannevar Bush]]'s essay "[[As We May Think]]" (July 1945), which inspired [[Douglas Engelbart]] and later [[Ted Nelson]] to develop the modern [[workstation]] and [[hypertext]] technology.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reingold|first1=Howard|title=Tools For Thought Chapter 9: The Loneliness of a Long-Distance Thinker|url=http://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/09.html#Chap09|website=Tools for Thought|access-date=January 29, 2018|date=1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalakov|first1=Georgi|title=The MEMEX of Vannevar Bush|url=http://history-computer.com/Internet/Dreamers/Bush.html|website=The History of Computers|access-date=January 29, 2018}}</ref>

''The Atlantic Monthly'' founded the Atlantic Monthly Press in 1917; for many years, it was operated in partnership with [[Little, Brown and Company]]. Its published books included ''[[Drums Along the Mohawk (novel)|Drums Along the Mohawk]]'' (1936) and ''[[Blue Highways]]'' (1982). The press was sold in 1986; today it is an imprint of [[Grove Atlantic]].<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Cohen| first = Roger| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Small House to Buy Atlantic Monthly Press| work = The New York Times| access-date = May 13, 2018| date = June 24, 1991| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/24/business/the-media-business-small-house-to-buy-atlantic-monthly-press.html}}</ref>

In addition to publishing notable fiction and poetry, ''The Atlantic'' has emerged in the 21st century as an influential platform for [[Long-form journalism|longform]] storytelling and newsmaker interviews. Influential cover stories have included [[Anne Marie Slaughter]]'s "Why Women Still Can't Have It All" (2012) and [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]]'s "Case for Reparations" (2014).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/23/315279271/the-atlantics-ta-nehisi-coates-builds-a-case-for-reparations|title='The Atlantic's' Ta-Nehisi Coates Builds 'A Case For Reparations'|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref> In 2015, [[Jeffrey Goldberg]]'s "Obama Doctrine" was widely discussed by American media and prompted response by many world leaders.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/world/middleeast/obama-criticizes-the-free-riders-among-americas-allies.html|title=Obama Criticizes the 'Free Riders' Among America's Allies|last=Landler|first=Mark|date=March 10, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 26, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

As of 2017, writers and frequent contributors to the print magazine include [[James Fallows]], [[Jeffrey Goldberg]], [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]], [[Molly Ball]], [[Caitlin Flanagan]], [[James Hamblin (physician)|James Hamblin]], [[Julia Ioffe]], [[Jonathan Rauch]], [[McKay Coppins]], [[Rosie Gray]], Gillian White, [[Adrienne LaFrance]], [[Vann R.

==Ownership==

Until recent decades, ''The Atlantic'' was known as a distinctively [[New England]] literary magazine (as opposed to ''[[Harper's]]'' and later ''[[The New Yorker]]'', both published in New York City). It achieved a national reputation and was important to the careers of many American writers and poets.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} By its third year, it was published by the noted Boston publishing house [[Ticknor and Fields]] (later to become part of [[Houghton Mifflin]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}), based in the city known for literary culture. The magazine was purchased in 1908 by its then editor, [[Ellery Sedgwick]], but remained in Boston.

In 1980, the magazine was acquired by [[Mortimer Zuckerman]], property magnate and founder of [[Boston Properties]], who became its chairman. On September 27, 1999, Zuckerman transferred ownership of the magazine to [[David G. Bradley]], owner of the [[National Journal Group]], which focused on news of Washington, D.C., and government. Bradley had promised that the magazine would stay in Boston for the foreseeable future, as it did for the next five and a half years.

In April 2005, however, the publishers announced that the editorial offices would be moved from their longtime home at 77 North Washington Street in Boston to join the company's advertising and circulation divisions in Washington, D.C.<ref name="leaving city">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/04/15/atlantic_148_year_institution_leaving_city/|title=Atlantic, 148-year institution, leaving city: Magazine of Twain, James, Howells heads to capital|date=April 15, 2005|last2=Mehegan|first2=David|first1=Mark|last1=Feeney|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]}}</ref> Later in August, Bradley told ''[[The New York Observer]]'' that the move was not made to save money—near-term savings would be $200,000–$300,000, a relatively small amount that would be swallowed by severance-related spending—but instead would serve to create a hub in Washington where the top minds from all of Bradley's publications could collaborate under the [[Atlantic Media Company]] umbrella. Few of the Boston staff agreed to move, and Bradley embarked on an open search for a new editorial staff.<ref>{{cite news |title=Atlantic owner scours country for cinder-editor |newspaper=[[New York Observer]] |date=August 29 – September 5, 2005}}</ref>

In 2006, Bradley hired [[James Bennet (journalist)|James Bennet]] as editor-in-chief; he had been the Jerusalem bureau chief for ''[[The New York Times]]''. He also hired writers, including [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] and [[Andrew Sullivan]].<ref name=Kurtz>{{Cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/05/AR2007080501576.html | title = The Atlantic's Owner Ponies Up | first1= Howard |last1=Kurtz | author-link=Howard Kurtz | date = August 6, 2007 |work=The Washington Post | access-date =August 18, 2007}}</ref> Jay Lauf joined the organization as publisher and vice-president in 2008; as of 2017, he was publisher and president of [[Quartz (publication)|''Quartz'']].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/a/masthead.mhtml |title=Atlantic masthead |journal=The Atlantic |access-date=October 7, 2010}}</ref>

Bennet and Bob Cohn became co-presidents of ''The Atlantic'' in early 2014, and Cohn became the publication's sole president in March 2016 when Bennet was tapped to lead ''The New York Times'' editorial page.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2016/03/bob-cohn-named-sole-president-of-the-atlantic/473610/|title=Bob Cohn Named Sole President of The Atlantic; James Bennet to Leadership Post at New York Times|date=March 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/business/media/james-bennet-will-lead-editorial-page-at-new-york-times.html|title=James Bennet Will Lead Editorial Page at New York Times|date=March 14, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 29, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Jeffrey Goldberg was named editor in chief in October 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2016/10/jeffrey-goldberg-named-editor-in-chief-of-the-atlantic/503576/|title=Jeffrey Goldberg Named Editor in Chief of The Atlantic|date=October 11, 2016}}</ref>

On July 28, 2017, ''The Atlantic'' announced that billionaire investor and philanthropist [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] (the widow of former [[Apple Inc.]] chairman and CEO [[Steve Jobs]]) had acquired majority ownership through her [[Emerson collective|Emerson Collective]] organization, with a staff member of Emerson Collective, Peter Lattman, being immediately named as ''The Atlantic''{{'}}s vice chairman. [[David G.

==Politics==
Throughout its history, ''The Atlantic'' has been reluctant to endorse political candidates in elections. In 1860, three years into publication, ''The Atlantic'''s then-editor [[James Russell Lowell]] endorsed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] for his first run for president and also endorsed the [[abolition of slavery]].<ref>[[James Russell Lowell|Lowell, James Russell]], [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1860/10/the-election-in-november/306549/ "The Election in November"], ''The Atlantic'', November 1860.</ref>

In 1964, Edward Weeks wrote on behalf of the editorial board in endorsing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and rebuking Republican [[Barry Goldwater]]'s candidacy.<ref>Weeks, Edward, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1964/10/the-1964-election/303598/ "The 1964 Election"], ''The Atlantic'', November 1964.</ref>

In 2016, the editorial board endorsed a presidential candidate, Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], for the third time since the magazine's founding, in a rebuke of Republican [[Donald Trump]]'s candidacy.<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-case-for-hillary-clinton-and-against-donald-trump/501161/ "Against Donald Trump"], ''The Atlantic'', November 2016.</ref> Since the election, the magazine has become a strong critic of President Trump.

==Reputation==
In June 2006, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' named ''The Atlantic'' one of the top ten English-language magazines, describing it as the "150-year-old granddaddy of periodicals" because "it keeps us smart and in the know" with cover stories on the then-forthcoming fight over ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. It also lauded regular features such as "Word Fugitives" and "Primary Sources" as "cultural barometers."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-0606140373jun15-story.html |title=Fourth Annual |author=Contributors |date=June 15, 2006 |website=Chicago Tribune |publisher=Chicago Tribune |access-date=September 23, 2020 }}</ref>

On January 14, 2013, ''The Atlantic''{{'}}s website published "[[Native advertising|sponsor content]]" promoting [[David Miscavige]], the leader of the [[Church of Scientology]]. While the magazine had previously published advertising looking like articles, this one was widely criticized. The page comments were moderated by the marketing team, not by editorial staff, and comments [[Criticism of Scientology|critical of the church]] were being removed. Later that day, ''The Atlantic'' removed the piece from its website and issued an apology.<ref name="Apology">[https://www.magnetmail.net/actions/email_web_version.cfm?recipient_id=699462885&message_id=2459857&user_id=NJG_Atlan&group_id=0&jobid=12656579 Statement from The Atlantic], Natalie Raabe.</ref><ref name="WaPo">[[Erik Wemple|Wemple, Erik]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/01/15/the-atlantics-scientology-problem-start-to-finish/ "The Atlantic's Scientology problem, start to finish"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blog, January 15, 2013.</ref><ref name="NYTimes">[[Brian Stelter|Stelter, Brian]], and Christine Haughney, [http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/the-atlantic-apologizes-for-scientology-ad/?_r=0 "The Atlantic Apologizes for Scientology Ad"], January 15, 2013, ''The New York Times''.</ref>

On November 1, 2020, ''The Atlantic'' retracted an article ("The Mad, Mad World of Niche Sports Among Ivy League–Obsessed Parents") after a ''[[Washington Post]]'' inquiry. An 800-word editors' note said, “We cannot attest to the trustworthiness and credibility of the author, and therefore we cannot attest to the veracity of the article.” The article's author, freelancer [[Ruth Shalit|Ruth Shalit Barrett]], left the staff of ''[[The New Republic]]'' in 1999 amid allegations of plagiarism.<ref name="Shalit fabrication">{{Cite web| last= Levenson|first= Michael|title= The Atlantic Retracts Ruth Shalit Barrett Article on Niche Sports|date= 2020-11-01|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/business/media/atlantic-ruth-shalit-barrett.html |website=www.nytimes.com |language=en |access-date=2020-11-02}}</ref><ref name="WaPo2">{{Cite web| last=Wemple |first=Erik |title=The Atlantic’s troubled niche-sports story |date=2020-10-30 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/30/atlantics-troubled-niche-sports-story |website=www.washingtonpost.com |language=en |access-date=2020-11-02}}</ref>
