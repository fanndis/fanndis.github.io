'''Rancho del Cielo''', also known in its English translation as '''''Sky's Ranch''''' or '''''Heaven's Ranch''''', is a {{convert|688|acre|mi2|adj=on}}/{{convert|278|ha|km2|adj=on}} [[ranch]] located atop the [[Santa Ynez Mountains|Santa Ynez Mountain range]] northwest of [[Santa Barbara, California]], [[United States]]. It served as a [[vacation home]] for [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]].

==History==
The ranch was originally named '''Rancho de los Picos''' after José Jesús Pico—a descendant of Santiago de la Cruz Pico who arrived with the Anza expedition in 1776—who [[Homestead Act|homesteaded]] it and built the original [[adobe]] house in 1871. The Pico family owned the ranch until 1941, when Joe, one of Jose Pico's sons, sold it to Frank Flournoy, a Santa Barbara County surveyor, for $6,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6000|1941|r=-2}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|US}}). In turn, he sold the ranch to Ray and Rosalie Cornelius, who then purchased additional land for the property.

The Reagans owned a ranch in the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] that was much closer to their home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]]. The Reagans sold that ranch to a movie company and it is now part of [[Malibu Creek State Park]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-14/news/vw-28_1_reagan-ranch|title=On What Was Once Reagan's Ranch, a Trail to the Chief|first=JOHN |last=McKINNEY|date=January 14, 1989|access-date=23 January 2018|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pe.com/2010/11/23/lake-elsinore-book-describes-years-working-on-reagans-ranch/|title=Book describes years working on Reagans ranch|first=B PETER |last=FISCHETTI | newspaper=[[Press-Enterprise]]|date= November 23, 2010|access-date=12 November 2018}}</ref> The Reagans then bought this ranch from the Corneliuses for about $527,000 in 1974 (equal to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|527000|1974|r=-3}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|US}}) when his second term as [[Governor of California]] was nearing an end.  The estate contained a pond called Lake Lucky, stables and a barn for horses, and a 1,500&nbsp;ft² (139 m²) house furnished with 1970s-style furniture. The ranch is located in a remote area on the crest of the [[Santa Ynez Mountains]] adjacent to Refugio Pass. The nearest highway on the ocean side of the mountains is [[U.S. Route 101]], with [[Solvang, California]] being the nearest community on the inland side of the mountains.

Reagan spent vacations during [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|his presidency]] at the ranch, which became known as the [[Western White House]]. He signed the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act]] of 1981 at the ranch and at various times hosted British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref name="LAT 2017-01-17"/> After leaving the presidency in 1989, the Reagans moved to a home in [[Bel-Air, Los Angeles|Bel-Air, California]] but kept the ranch as a retreat.

Because of his [[Alzheimer's disease]], Reagan last visited the ranch in 1995. Nancy Reagan last visited in 1998, before selling the property to the [[Young America's Foundation]], a conservative group which preserves it today as what it calls "a living monument to Reagan's ideas, values, and lasting accomplishments."<ref name="LAT 2017-01-17"/> Although the ranch is closed to the public, Young America's Foundation offers students and supporters the opportunity to visit the property.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/21/news/mn-41572|title=Conservative Group Buys Reagan Ranch|first=FAYE |last=FIORE|date= April  21, 1998|access-date=23 January 2018|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref name="LAT 2017-01-17">{{cite news|url=http://beta.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-reagan-ranch-young-conservatives-20170117-htmlstory.html|title=Reagan Ranch has transformed into a spawning ground for young conservatives |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=PHIL |last=WILLON|date=January 18, 2018 |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref>
