'''Crimea''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|aɪ|ˈ|m|iː|ə}}; {{lang-ru|Крым}}; {{lang-uk|Крим|Krym}}; {{lang-crh|Къырым|translit=Kirim/Qırım}}; {{lang-grc|Κιμμερία/Ταυρική|translit=Kimmería/Taurikḗ}}) is a [[peninsula]] located on the northern coast of the [[Black Sea]] in [[Eastern Europe]] that is almost completely surrounded by both the Black Sea and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]] to the northeast. The [[status of Crimea]] is disputed. It is claimed by [[Ukraine]] and recognized as Ukrainian by most other countries, although it has been administered by Russia following its [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation to the country]] in 2014. Crimea is located south of the [[Ukrainian region]] of [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], to which it is connected by the [[Isthmus of Perekop]], and west of the [[Russia]]n region of [[Kuban]], from which it is separated by the [[Strait of Kerch]] though linked by the [[Crimean Bridge]] since 2018. The [[Arabat Spit]] is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named [[Sivash]] from the Sea of Azov. Across the Black Sea to its west is [[Romania]], and to its south, [[Turkey]].

Crimea (or '''Tauric Peninsula''', as it was called from [[History of Crimea#Antiquity|antiquity]] until the [[early modern period]]) has historically been at the boundary between the [[Classical antiquity|classical world]] and the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]]. Its southern fringe was colonised by the [[Greek colonies|Greeks]], the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], the [[Roman Crimea|Romans]], the [[Cherson (theme)|Byzantine Empire]], the [[Principality of Theodoro|Crimean Goths]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while at the same time its interior was occupied by a changing cast of invading [[steppe nomads]] and empires, such as the [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Goths]], [[Alans]], [[Bulgars]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Kipchaks]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the [[Crimean Khanate]] during the 15th to 18th century.

In 1783, Crimea was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed by the Russian Empire]] as the result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]]. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, Crimea became an [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|autonomous republic]] within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]. During [[World War II]], Crimea was downgraded to the [[Crimean Oblast]] after its entire indigenous population, the [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|were deported to Central Asia]], an act recognized as a genocide by Ukraine and 3 other countries. In 1954, it was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred to the Ukrainian SSR]] from the [[Russian SFSR]].<ref>[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/why-did-russia-give-away-crimea-sixty-years-ago?gclid=CLHnyZC7ndACFSLicgod-UEIXw Why Did Russia Give Away Crimea Sixty Years Ago?], Mark Kramer, [[The Wilson Center]], 19 March 2014</ref>

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was reestablished as an independent state in 1991, and most of the peninsula was reorganized as the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]], while the city of [[Sevastopol]] retained its special status within Ukraine. The 1997 [[Partition Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet]] partitioned the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet and allowed Russia to continue basing its fleet in Crimea: both the [[Ukrainian Naval Forces]] and Russian's Black Sea Fleet were to be headquartered in Sevastopol. Ukraine extended Russia's lease of the naval facilities under the 2010 [[Kharkiv Pact]] in exchange for further discounted [[natural gas]].

==Name==

The classical name ''[[History of Crimea#Antiquity|Tauris]]'' or ''Taurica'' is from the Greek Ταυρική (Taurikḗ), after the peninsula's Scytho-Cimmerian inhabitants, the [[Tauri]].

[[Strabo]] (''Geography'' vii 4.3, xi. 2.5), [[Polybius]], (''Histories'' 4.39.4), and [[Ptolemy]] (''Geographia''. II, v 9.5) refer variously to the [[Strait of Kerch]] as the Κιμμερικὸς Βόσπορος (''Kimmerikos Bosporos'', romanized spelling, ''Bosporus Cimmerius''), its [[Kerch Peninsula|easternmost part]] as the Κιμμέριον Ἄκρον (''Kimmerion Akron'', Roman name: Promontorium Cimmerium,<ref name="history1779">{{cite book|author=Compiled from original authors|title=An Universal History,rom the Earliest Accounts to the Present Time|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CCsIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA129|year=1779|pages=127–129|chapter=The History of the Bosporus}}</ref> as well as to the city of [[Kimmerikon|Cimmerium]] and whence the name of the [[Bosporan Kingdom|Kingdom of the Cimmerian Bosporus]] (Κιμμερικοῦ Βοσπόρου).

The [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] name of the peninsula is Qırım ({{lang-crh|Къырым|translit=Kirim/Qırım}}) and so also for the city of ''Krym'' which is now called ''[[Stary Krym|Staryi Krym]]''<ref>William Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'' (1854), s.v. ''Taurica Chersonesus''. vol. ii, p. 1109.</ref> which served as a capital of the Crimean province of the [[Golden Horde]]. Some sources hold that the name of the capital was extended to the entire peninsula at some point during [[Crimean Khanate|Ottoman suzerainty]].<ref>[[Vasily Radlov|W. Radloff]], ''Versuch eines Wörterbuches der Türk-Dialecte'' (1888), ii. 745</ref>
But the earliest recorded use of the toponym "Crimea"{{clarify|date=February 2020}} for the peninsula<ref>Edward Allworth, ''The Tatars of Crimea: Return to the Homeland: Studies and Documents'', Duke University Press, 1998, p.6</ref> occurred between 1315–1329 AD by the Arab writer [[Abu'l-Fida|Abū al-Fidā]] where he recounts a political fight in 1300–1301 AD resulting in a rival's decapitation and having "sent his head to the Crimea".<ref>Abū al-Fidā , Mukhtaṣar tāʾrīkh al-bashar (“[[Concise History of Humanity|A Brief History of Mankind")]] , 1315–1329; English translation of chronicle contemporaneous with Abū al-Fidā in ''The Memoirs of a Syrian Prince : Abul̓-Fidā,̕ sultan of Ḥamāh (672-732/1273-1331)'' by Peter M. Holt, Franz Steiner Verlag, 1983, pp. 38–39.</ref>

The origin of the word ''Qırım'' is uncertain. Suggestions argued in various sources include:

Other suggestions either unsupported or contradicted by sources, apparently based on similarity in sound, include:
# a derivation from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Cremnoi'' (Κρημνοί, in post-classical [[Koiné Greek]] pronunciation, ''Crimni'', i.e., "the Cliffs", a port on [[Maeotian Swamp|Lake Maeotis]] (Sea of Azov) cited by [[Herodotus]] in ''The Histories'' 4.20.1 and 4.110.2).<ref>A. D. (Alfred Denis) Godley. ''Herodotus''. Cambridge. Harvard University Press. vol. 2, 1921, p. 221.</ref> However, Herodotus identifies the port not in Crimea, but as being on the west coast of the Sea of Azov. No evidence has been identified that this name was ever in use for the peninsula.

# The Turkic term (e.g., in {{Lang-tr|Kırım}}) is related to the [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] appellation ''kerm''  "wall", but sources indicate that the Mongolian appellation of the Crimean peninsula of ''Qaram'' is phonetically incompatible with ''kerm/kerem'' and therefore deriving from another original term.<ref>See [[John Krueger|John Richard Krueger]], specialist in the studies of Chuvash, Yakut, and the Mongolian languages in Edward Allworth, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=srR_4d3mjTAC The Tatars of Crimea: Return to the Homeland : Studies and Documents]'', Duke University Press, 1998, p. 24.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FdsyAQAAQBAJ Jews in Byzantium: Dialectics of Minority and Majority Cultures], BRILL, 2011, p.753, n. 102.</ref><ref>The Mongolian ''kori⁻'' is explained as a loan from Turkic by Doerfer ''Türkische und mongolische Elemente im Neupersischen'' 3 (1967), 450 and by Щербак, ''Ранние тюркско-монгольские языковые связи (VIII-XIV вв.)''

"it was indeed at some point between the 1730s and the 1770s that the dream of recreating ancient 'Taurida' in the southern Crimea was conceived. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]]'s plan was to create a paradisiacal imperial 'garden' there, and her Greek archbishop [[Eugenios Voulgaris]] obliged by inventing a new etymology for the old name of Tauris, deriving it from ''taphros'', which (he claimed) was the ancient Greek for a ditch dug by human hands."</ref> While it was replaced with ''Krym'' ({{lang-uk|Крим}}; {{lang-ru|Крым}}) in the Soviet Union and has had no official status since 1921, it is still used by some institutions in Crimea, such as the [[Taurida National University]], the [[FC Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol football club]], or the Tavrida federal highway.

===Ancient history===
{{further|Bosporan Kingdom|Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Roman Crimea}}

In the 8th century BCE, the [[Cimmerians]] migrated to the area in retreat from [[Scythians|Scythian]] advances, of whom the latter also migrated to the region.  Contemporaneously, and possibly because of the migration, the region came within the sphere of Greek maritime interest and became the site of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greek colonies]]. The most important Greek city was [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesos]] at the edge of today's Sevastopol.

The Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]], under [[Darius I]], expanded to Crimea as part of [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his campaigns]] against the [[Scythians]] in 513 BCE.

The peninsula, then under the control of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], later became a client kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]] in 63 BCE.

===Medieval history===
In the 9th century CE, Byzantium established the [[Theme of Cherson]] to defend against incursions by the [[Rus' Khaganate]]. The Crimean peninsula from this time was contested between Byzantium, Rus' and [[Khazaria]]. The area remained the site of overlapping interests and contact between the early medieval Slavic, Turkic and Greek spheres. It became a center of [[Saqaliba|slave trade]]. [[Early Slavs|Slavs]] were sold to Byzantium and other places in Anatolia and the Middle-East during this period.{{cn|date=August 2020}} The peninsula was wrested from the Byzantines by the [[Kievan Rus']] in the 10th century; the last Byzantine outpost, [[Chersonesus]] was taken in 988 AD. A year later, [[Vladimir the Great|Grand Prince Vladimir of Kiev]] accepted the hand of Emperor [[Basil II]]'s sister [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Anna]] in marriage, and was [[baptized]] by the local Byzantine priest at Chersonesus, thus marking the entry of Russia into the Christian world.<ref name="Norwich2013">{{cite book|author=John Julius Norwich|title=A Short History of Byzantium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7JtvMQEACAAJ|year=2013|publisher=Penguin Books, Limited|isbn=978-0-241-95305-1|page= 210}}</ref>

===Mongol Conquest (1238–1449)===
Trapezuntine [[Perateia]] had already been subjected to pressure from the Genoese and Kipchaks by the time [[Alexios I of Trebizond]] died in 1222 before the [[Mongol invasions]] began its western sweep through [[Volga Bulgaria]] in 1223. With them, control of the peninsula changed in 1238, as all but the Perateia of Crimea was incorporated into the territory of the Golden Horde throughout the 14th century CE. In the course of the 13th century CE, portions were controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]] and by the [[Republic of Genoa]], the Perateia soon became the [[Principality of Theodoro]] and [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Genoese Gazaria]], respectively.

The [[Taurida Oblast]] was created by a decree of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] on 2 February 1784. The center of the [[oblast]] was first in [[Karasubazar]] but was moved to Simferopol later in 1784. The establishment decree divided the oblast into 7 [[uyezd]]s. However, by a decree of [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] on 12 December 1796, the oblast was abolished and the territory, divided into 2 uyezds (Akmechetsky ''[Акмечетский]'' and Perekopsky ''[Перекопский]'') was attached to the second incarnation of the [[Novorossiysk Governorate]].

=== Russian Civil War (1917–1921)===
{{see also|Crimean People's Republic|Taurida Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean Regional Government|Crimean Socialist Soviet Republic}}
Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the military and political situation in Crimea was chaotic like that in much of Russia. During the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], Crimea changed hands numerous times and was for a time a stronghold of the anti-Bolshevik [[White movement|White Army]]. The [[White Army]] controlled Crimea before remnants were finally driven out by the [[Red Army]] in November 1920. It was in Crimea that the White Russians led by [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|General Wrangel]] made their last stand against [[Nestor Makhno]] and the Red Army. When resistance was crushed, many of the anti-Communist fighters and civilians escaped by ship to [[Istanbul]]. Between 56,000 and 150,000 of the Whites were murdered as part of the [[Red Terror]], organized by [[Béla Kun]].

===Soviet Union (1921–1991)===
{{see also|Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean Oblast}}
Crimea became part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] in 1921 as the [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], which became part of the Soviet Union in 1922.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the peninsula was [[Crimean Campaign|invaded]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Romanian troops]] in summer 1941 across the [[Isthmus of Perekop]]. Following the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|capture of Sevastopol]] on 4 July 1942, Crimea was occupied until German and Romanian forces were expelled in an [[Crimean Offensive|offensive]] by Soviet forces ending in May 1944.

====Region in Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1945–1954)====
On 25 June 1946, it was downgraded to the Crimean Oblast, and the [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatars were deported]] for alleged collaboration with the [[Nazism|Nazi]] forces. A total of more than 230,000 people – about a fifth of the total population of the Crimean Peninsula at that time – were deported, mainly to [[Uzbekistan]]. 14,300 Greeks, 12,075 Bulgarians, and about 10,000 Armenians were also expelled.

====Region in Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (1954–1991)====
{{Main|1954 transfer of Crimea}}

On 19 February 1954, the Presidium of the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR issued [[1954 transfer of Crimea|a decree on the transfer of the Crimean region of the RSFSR to the Ukrainian SSR]].<ref>"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/ukraine-and-west-hot-air-hypocrisy-crimea-russia Ukraine and the west: hot air and hypocrisy]". ''[[The Guardian]]''. 10 March 2014.</ref> This Supreme Soviet Decree states that this transfer was motivated by "the commonality of the economy, the proximity, and close economic and cultural relations between the Crimean region and the Ukrainian SSR".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iccrimea.org/historical/crimeatransfer.html |title=The Transfer of Crimea to Ukraine |accessdate=25 March 2007 |date=July 2005 |work=International Committee for Crimea }}</ref> At that time no vote or referendum took place, and Crimean population had no say in the transfer (also typical of other Soviet border changes). After the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, doubts have been expressed – from the Russian side by all means, but even by Western historians (Richard Sakwa, "Frontline Ukraine. Crisis in the Borderlands", 2015) – about the very legitimacy of the 1954 transition of Crimea to Ukraine; in the critics' view the transition contradicted even the Soviet law.

In post-war years, Crimea thrived as a [[tourist destination]], with new attractions and sanatoriums for tourists. Tourists came from all around the Soviet Union and neighbouring countries, particularly from the [[German Democratic Republic]].<ref name="blacksea-crimea/hist">{{cite web |url=http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/history1.html |title=History |accessdate=28 March 2007 |work=blacksea-crimea.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404102214/http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/history1.html |archive-date=4 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In time the peninsula also became a major tourist destination for cruises originating in Greece and Turkey. Crimea's infrastructure and manufacturing also developed, particularly around the sea ports at [[Kerch]] and [[Sevastopol]] and in the oblast's landlocked capital, [[Simferopol]]. Populations of [[Ukrainians]] and [[Russians]] alike doubled, with more than 1.6&nbsp;million Russians and 626,000 Ukrainians living on the peninsula by 1989.<ref name="blacksea-crimea/hist" />

Covering an area of {{convert|27000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, Crimea is located on the northern coast of the Black Sea and on the western coast of the [[Sea of Azov]]; the only land border is shared with Ukraine's [[Kherson Oblast]] on the north. Crimea is almost an island and only connected to the continent by the [[Isthmus of Perekop]], a strip of land about {{convert|5|–|7|km|mi|1}} wide.

Much of the natural border between the Crimean Peninsula and the Ukrainian mainland comprises the [[Sivash]] or "Rotten Sea", a large system of shallow lagoons stretching along the western shore of the Sea of Azov. Besides the [[isthmus of Perekop]], the peninsula is connected to the Kherson Oblast's [[Henichesk Raion]] by bridges over the narrow Chonhar and [[Henichesk Strait|Henichesk]] straits and over Kerch Strait to the [[Krasnodar Krai]]. The northern part of [[Arabat Spit]] is administratively part of Henichesk Raion in Kherson Oblast, including its two rural communities of [[Shchaslyvtseve]] and [[Strilkove]]. The eastern tip of the Crimean peninsula comprises the [[Kerch Peninsula]], separated from [[Taman Peninsula]] on the Russian mainland by the [[Kerch Strait]], which connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov, at a width of between {{convert|3|–|13|km|mi|1}}.

Geographers generally divide the peninsula into three zones: [[Pontic steppe|steppe]], [[Crimean Mountains|mountains]] and [[Crimean coast|southern coast]].

Given its long history and many conquerors, most towns in Crimea have several names.

'''West:''' The [[Isthmus of Perekop]] /[[Perekop]]/[[Or Qapi]], about {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} wide, connects Crimea to the mainland. It was often fortified and sometimes garrisoned by the Turks. The [[North Crimean Canal]] now crosses it to bring water from the Dnieper. To the west [[Karkinit Bay]] separates the [[Tarkhankut Peninsula]] from the mainland. On the north side of the peninsula is [[Chernomorskoe]]/Kalos [[Liman (landform)|Limen]]. On the south side is the large [[Donuzlav]] Bay and the port and ancient Greek settlement of Eupatoria/[[Yevpatoria]]/Kerkinitis/Gozleve. The coast then runs south to [[Sevastopol]]/[[Chersonesus]], a good natural harbor, great naval base and the largest city on the peninsula. At the head of [[Sevastopol Bay]] stands [[Inkermann]]/Kalamita. South of Sevastopol is the small [[Heracles Peninsula]].

'''South:''' In the south, between the [[Crimean Mountains]] and the sea runs a narrow coastal strip which was [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|held by the Genoese]] and (after 1475) by the Turks. Under Russian rule it became a kind of [[riviera]]. In Soviet times the many palaces were replaced{{by whom|date=July 2019}} with [[dacha]]s and health resorts. From west to east are: [[Heracles Peninsula]]; [[Balaklava]]/Symbalon/Cembalo, a smaller natural harbor south of Sevastopol; [[Foros, Crimea|Foros]], the southernmost point; [[Alupka]] with the [[Vorontsov Palace (Alupka)]]; [[Gaspra]]; [[Yalta]]; [[Gurzuf]]; [[Alushta]]. Further east is [[Sudak]]/Sougdia/Soldaia with its Genoese fort. Further east still is Theodosia/Kaffa/[[Feodosia]], once a great [[slave market|slave-mart]] and a kind of capital for the Genoese and Turks. Unlike the other southern ports, Feodosia has no mountains to its north. At the east end of the {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[Kerch Peninsula]] is [[Kerch]]/[[Panticapaeum]], once the capital of the [[Bosporian Kingdom]]. Just south of Kerch the new [[Crimean Bridge]] (opened in 2018) connects Crimea to the [[Taman Peninsula]].

'''Sea of Azov:''' There is little on the south shore. The west shore is marked by the [[Arabat Spit]]. Behind it is the [[Syvash]] or "Putrid Sea", a system of lakes and marshes which in the far north extend west to the Perekop Isthmus. Road- and rail-bridges cross the northern part of Syvash.

'''Interior:''' Most of the former capitals of Crimea stood on the north side of the mountains. [[Mangup]]/Doros (Gothic, Theodoro). [[Bakhchisarai]] (1532–1783).
Southeast of Bakhchisarai is the cliff-fort of [[Chufut-Kale]]/Qirq Or which was used in more warlike times. [[Simferopol]]/Ak-Mechet, the modern capital. [[Karasu-Bazar]]/Bilohorsk was a commercial center. Solkhat/[[Stary Krym|Staryi Krym]] was the old Tatar capital. Towns on the northern steppe area are all modern, notably [[Dzhankoi]], a major road- and rail-junction.

'''Rivers:''' The longest is the [[Salhir River]] which rises southeast of Simferopol and flows north and northeast to the Sea of Azov. The [[Alma River (Crimea)|Alma River]] flows west to reach the Black Sea between Eupatoria and Sevastopol. The shorter [[Chornaya River (Crimea)]] flows west to Sevastopol Bay.

'''Nearby:''' East of the Kerch Strait the Ancient Greeks founded colonies at [[Phanagoria]] (at the head of [[Taman Bay]]), [[Hermonassa]] (later Tmutarakan and [[Taman, Russia|Taman]]), [[Gorgippia]] (later a Turkish port and now Anapa). At the northeast point of the Sea of Azov at the mouth of the Don River were [[Tanais]], Azak/[[Azov]] and now [[Rostov-on-Don]]. North of the peninsula the Dnieper turns westward and enters the Black Sea through the east–west [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]] which also receives the Bug River. At the mouth of the Bug stood [[Olvia]]. At the mouth of the estuary is [[Ochakiv]]. [[Odessa]] stands where the coast turns southwest. Further southwest is [[Tyras]]/Akkerman/[[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]].

The southeast coast is flanked at a distance of {{convert|8|–|12|km|mi|1}} from the sea by a parallel range of mountains: the [[Crimean Mountains]].<ref>The [[Crimean Mountains]] may also be referred to as the Yaylâ Dağ or Alpine Meadow Mountains.</ref> These mountains are backed by [[Cuesta|secondary parallel ranges]].

The main range of these mountains rises with extraordinary abruptness from the deep floor of the Black Sea to an altitude of {{convert|600|–|1545|m|ft|0}}, beginning at the southwest point of the [[peninsula]], called {{interlanguage link|Cape Fiolente|uk|Фіолент}}.

===Hydrography===
There are 257 rivers and major streams on the Crimean peninsula; they are primarily fed by rainwater, with snowmelt playing a very minor role. This makes for significant annual fluctuation in water flow, with many streams drying up completely during the summer.<ref>{{Cite book|author= Jaoshvili, Shalva |year= 2002 |title= The rivers of the Black Sea |location= Copenhagen |publisher= European Environment Agency |page= 15 |oclc= 891861999 |url= http://edz.bib.uni-mannheim.de/daten/edz-bn/eua/02/C__DOKUME~1_ZEFZEI_LOKALE~1_TEMP_plugtmp_tech71_en.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160310073738/http://edz.bib.uni-mannheim.de/daten/edz-bn/eua/02/C__DOKUME~1_ZEFZEI_LOKALE~1_TEMP_plugtmp_tech71_en.pdf |archivedate= 10 March 2016 |url-status= live}}</ref> The largest rivers are the [[Salhyr]] (Salğır, Салгир), the Kacha (Кача), the [[Alma (Crimea)|Alma]] (Альма), and the Belbek (Бельбек).

===Steppe===
{{main|Pontic-Caspian steppe}}
Seventy-five percent of the remaining area of Crimea consists of semiarid [[prairie]] lands, a southward continuation of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]], which slope gently to the northwest from the foothills of the Crimean Mountains.
Numerous [[kurgan]]s, or [[burial mound]]s, of the ancient [[Scythia]]ns are scattered across the Crimean steppes.

===Crimean Riviera===
[[File:Ялта Южный берег ДДима.jpg|thumb|The [[Crimean Mountains]] in the background and [[Yalta]] as seen from the [[Tsar's Path]].]]

The terrain that lies south of the sheltering Crimean Mountain range is of an altogether different character. Here, the narrow strip of coast and the slopes of the mountains are smothered with greenery. This "riviera" stretches along the southeast coast from capes [[Cape Fiolente|Fiolente]] and [[Cape Aya|Aya]], in the south, to Feodosia. It is studded with summer sea-bathing resorts such as [[Alupka]], [[Yalta]], [[Gurzuf]], [[Alushta]], [[Sudak]], and [[Feodosia]]. During the years of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule, the resorts and [[dacha]]s of this coast served as prime perquisites of the politically loyal.{{Citation needed|date= December 2012}}<sup>why here? and ref?</sup> In addition, vineyards and fruit orchards are located in the region. Fishing, mining, and the production of [[essential oil]]s are also important. Numerous Crimean Tatar villages, mosques, [[monastery|monasteries]], and palaces of the Russian imperial family and nobles are found here, as well as picturesque ancient Greek and medieval castles.

The Crimean Mountains and the southern coast are part of the [[Crimean Submediterranean forest complex]] ecoregion. The natural vegetation consists of scrublands, woodlands, and forests, with a climate and vegetation similar to the [[Mediterranean Basin]].

===Climate===

[[File:Koreiz - beach3.jpg|thumb|Tourism is an important sector of Crimea's economy]]

In 2016 Crimea had Nominal GDP of [[US$]]7 billion and [[US$]]3,000 per capita.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mrd.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_ts/mrd/ru/statistics/grp/|title=Валовой региональный продукт::Мордовиястат|website=mrd.gks.ru|access-date=19 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217021320/http://mrd.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_ts/mrd/ru/statistics/grp/|archive-date=17 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The main branches of the modern Crimean economy are agriculture and fishing oysters pearls, industry and manufacturing, tourism, and ports. Industrial plants are situated for the most part in the southern coast (Eupatoria Sevastopol Feodosia Kerch) regions of the republic, few northern (Armiansk Krasnoperekopsk Dzhankoi), aside from the central area, mainly Simferopol okrug and eastern region in Nizhnegorsk (few plants, same for Dzhankoj) city. Important industrial cities include [[Dzhankoi]], housing a major railway connection, [[Krasnoperekopsk]] and [[Armiansk]], among others.

After the Russian annexation of Crimea in early 2014 and subsequent sanctions targeting Crimea, the tourist industry suffered major losses for two years.

The development of Crimea as a holiday destination began in the second half of the 19th century. The development of the transport networks brought masses of tourists from central parts of the [[Russian Empire]].
At the beginning of the 20th century, a major development of palaces, villas, and dachas began—most of which remain. These are some of the main attractions of Crimea as a tourist destination. There are many [[Crimean legends]] about famous touristic places, which attract the attention of tourists.

A new phase of tourist development began when the Soviet government realised the potential of the healing quality of the local air, lakes and therapeutic muds. It became a "health" destination for Soviet workers, and hundreds of thousands of Soviet tourists visited Crimea.

[[Artek (camp)|Artek]] is a former [[Young Pioneer camp]] on the [[Black Sea]] in the town of [[Hurzuf]], near [[Ayu-Dag]], established in 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artek.org/History%20Artek/history%20/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150324131614/http://www.artek.org/History%20Artek/history%20/ |archive-date=24 March 2015|title=История "Артека" |trans-title=History of Artek |work=Артек |year=2010}} (This has a slow to load URL.)</ref><ref name="tub"/> By 1969 it had an area of {{cvt|3.2|km2}}, and consisted of 150 buildings. Unlike most of the young pioneer camps, Artek was an all-year camp, due to the warm climate. Artek was considered to be a privilege for Soviet children during its existence, as well as for children from other communist countries. During its heyday, 27,000 children a year vacationed at Artek. Between 1925 and 1969 the camp hosted 300,000 children.<ref>{{citation|encyclopedia=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd ed. |url=http://bse.sci-lib.com/article072849.html |trans-title=Entry on Artek |title=Артек  |access-date=22 June 2020 }}</ref> After the breaking up of the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] in 1991 its prestige declined, though it remained a popular vacation destination.<ref name="tub">{{citation|url=http://ukrainian.su/kryim/artek-mezhdunarodnyiy-detskiy-tsentr.html |title=Артек – международный детский центр |trans-title=The International Children Center Artek |work=Города и области Украины (Cities and regions of Ukraine)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607133524/http://ukrainian.su/kryim/artek-mezhdunarodnyiy-detskiy-tsentr.html |date=7 June 2014|archive-date=7 June 2014}}</ref>

In the 1990s, Crimea became more of a get-away destination than a "health-improvement" destination. The most visited areas are the south shore of Crimea with cities of Yalta and Alushta, the western shore – Eupatoria and Saki, and the south-eastern shore – Feodosia and Sudak.
According to [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], Crimea was among the top 20 travel destinations in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/best-trips-2013/|title=Best Trips 2013, Crimea|author=National Geographic Society|work=National Geographic|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>

The politics of Crimea is that of the [[Republic of Crimea]] on one hand, and that of the [[Federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of [[Sevastopol]] on the other. Since becoming the 84th and 85th Federal Subjects of the Russian Federation in 2014,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/7ead9b64-b048-11e3-8efc-00144feab7de |title= Crimea – Russia's return |date= 31 March 2014 |accessdate= 4 November 2014}}</ref> both have strongly supported [[United Russia]] in both local and [[Elections in Russia|national elections]].

Ethnic composition of Crimea's population has changed dramatically since the early 20th century. The 1897 [[Russian Empire Census]] for the [[Taurida Governorate]] reported: 196,854 (13.06%) Crimean Tatars, 404,463 (27.94%) Russians and 611,121 (42.21%) Ukrainians. But these numbers included Berdyansky, Dneprovsky and Melitopolsky [[uyezds]] which were on mainland, not in Crimea. The population number excluding these uyezds is given in the table below.

[[Alexander Pushkin]] visited [[Bakhchysarai]] in 1820 and later wrote the poem [[The Fountain of Bakhchisaray]]. Crimea was the background for [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s seminal work, [[The Crimean Sonnets]] inspired by his 1825 travel. A series of 18 [[sonnets]] constitute an artistic telling of a journey to and through the Crimea, they feature romantic descriptions of the oriental nature and culture of the East which show the despair of an exile longing for the homeland, driven from his home by a violent enemy.

[[Ivan Aivazovsky]], the 19th-century marine painter of Armenian origin, who is considered one of the major artists of his era was born in [[Feodosia]] and lived there for the most part of his life. Many of his paintings depict the Black Sea. He also created battle paintings during the Crimean War.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogachevsky|first=Alexander|title=Ivan Aivazovsky (1817–1900)|url=http://www.tufts.edu/programs/mma/fah189/2003/alex/aboutframeset.htm|publisher=[[Tufts University]]|accessdate=10 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319030420/http://www.tufts.edu/programs/mma/fah189/2003/alex/aboutframeset.htm|archive-date=19 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following [[2014 Crimean status referendum|Crimea's vote to join Russia]] and subsequent [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] in March 2014, the top football clubs withdrew from the [[Ukrainian football league system|Ukrainian leagues]]. Some clubs registered to join the Russian leagues but the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] objected.
