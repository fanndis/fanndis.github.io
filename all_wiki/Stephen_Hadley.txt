He admitted fault in allowing a disputed claim about Iraq's quest for nuclear weapons material from [[Niger]] to be included in Bush's January 28, 2003 [[State of the Union Address]] (see [[Niger uranium forgeries]]). On July 22, 2003, Hadley offered his resignation to Bush because he had "failed in that responsibility" and that "the high standards the president set were not met." Bush denied Hadley's request. Amid this, ''[[The Times]]'' of London reported that Hadley was [[Robert Novak]]'s source for [[Valerie Plame]]'s name in the [[Plame affair|CIA leak scandal]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith |first1=Michael |last2=Baxter |first2=Sarah |date=November 20, 2005 |title=Security adviser named as source in CIA scandal |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1880016,00.html |newspaper=The Sunday Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014063659/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C2089-1880016%2C00.html |archive-date=October 14, 2008 |publisher=Times Online |access-date=November 11, 2016 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> but this report proved to be false when [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] admitted that he was Novak's source.<ref>McBride, Kelly (November 8, 2007).

Hadley was known for avoiding focused public attention.<ref name=spot>* [http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/eaton050205.html New National Security Adviser Shuns the Spotlight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505080903/http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/eaton050205.html |date=May 5, 2005 }} Newhouse News Service</ref> In a 2006 profile, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' described Hadley as "a modest man in an immodest job. In a town populated by people nursing grandiose views of their own importance and scheming for greater glory, Hadley still thinks of himself as a staff man. He sits at the pinnacle of power, but articulates no sweeping personal vision of the world and has made a point of staying in the shadows."<ref name =nostage >[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/28/AR2006012800935.html The Security Adviser Who Wants the Role, Not the Stage] from the ''[[Washington Post]]'', by Peter Baker, January 29, 2006</ref>

In his book ''[[Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid]]'', former President [[Jimmy Carter]] recounts that Hadley, in his capacity as national security adviser (Carter calls him by title rather than by name) personally denied Carter permission to visit [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]] president [[Bashar al-Assad]] in early 2005, in the wake of the administration's decision to isolate the regime, due its "differences with Syria concerning U.S. policy in [[Iraq]]".<ref>Carter, Jimmy (2006).
