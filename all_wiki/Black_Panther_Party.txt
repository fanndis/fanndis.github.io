Black Panther Party members were involved in many fatal firefights with police. Newton declared:<blockquote>[[Malcolm X|Malcolm]], implacable to the ultimate degree, held out to the Black masses ... liberation from the chains of the oppressor and the treacherous embrace of the endorsed [Black] spokesmen.

In 1967, the [[Mulford Act]] was passed by the California legislature and signed by governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. The bill was crafted in response to members of the Black Panther Party who were [[copwatching]]. The bill repealed a law that allowed public carrying of loaded firearms.

In 1969, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Director [[J.

Government persecution initially contributed to the party's growth, as killings and arrests of Panthers increased its support among [[African Americans]] and the broad political left, who both valued the Panthers as a powerful force opposed to [[Racial segregation in the United States|de facto segregation]] and the [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]]. The party enrolled the most members and had the most influence in the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Area, [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Seattle]], and [[Philadelphia]].<ref name="depts.washington.edu">{{cite web|title=Mapping the Black Panther Party in Key Cities|url=http://depts.washington.edu/moves/BPP_map-cities.shtml|website=Mapping American Social Movements|access-date=January 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101161159/http://depts.washington.edu/moves/BPP_map-cities.shtml|archive-date=January 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> There were active chapters in many prisons, at a time when an increasing number of young African-American men were being incarcerated.

Black Panther Party membership reached a peak in 1970, with offices in 68 cities and thousands of members, but it began to decline over the following decade. After its leaders and members were vilified by the mainstream press, public support for the party waned, and the group became more isolated.<ref>{{harvnb|Barker|2015}}</ref> In-fighting among Party leadership, fomented largely by the FBI's COINTELPRO operation, led to expulsions and defections that decimated the membership.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|loc=conclusion}}</ref> Popular support for the Party declined further after reports of the group's alleged criminal activities, such as drug dealing and [[extortion]] of Oakland merchants.<ref>[[Philip Foner]], ''The Black Panthers Speak'', Da Capo Press, 2002.</ref> By 1972 most Panther activity centered on the national headquarters and a school in Oakland, where the party continued to influence local politics.

The Party's history is controversial. Scholars have characterized the Black Panther Party as the most influential black movement organization of the late 1960s, and "the strongest link between the domestic Black Liberation Struggle and global opponents of American imperialism".<ref name=":2">{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=3}}</ref> Other commentators have described the Party as more criminal than political, characterized by "defiant posturing over substance".<ref>{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=340}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], tens of thousands of blacks left the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] during the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]], moving to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and other cities in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] to find work in the war industries such as [[Kaiser Shipyards]]. The sweeping migration transformed the Bay Area as well as cities throughout the [[Western United States|West]] and [[Northern United States|North]], altering the once white-dominated demographics.<ref>{{harvnb|Murch|2010|p=4}}</ref> A new generation of young blacks growing up in these cities faced new forms of poverty and racism unfamiliar to their parents, and they sought to develop new forms of politics to address them.<ref>{{harvnb|Murch|2010|p=5}}</ref> Black Panther Party membership "consisted of recent migrants whose families traveled north and west to escape the southern racial regime, only to be confronted with new forms of segregation and repression".<ref>{{harvnb|Murch|2010|p=6}}</ref> In the early 1960s, the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] had dismantled the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system of racial caste subordination in the South with tactics of [[Pacifism|non-violent civil disobedience]], and demanding full citizenship rights for black people.<ref name="Bloom and Martin, 2013, p. 11">{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=11}}</ref> However, not much changed in the cities of the North and West. As the wartime and post-war jobs which drew much of the black migration "fled to the suburbs along with white residents", the black population was concentrated in poor "urban ghettos" with high unemployment and substandard housing, and was mostly excluded from political representation, top universities, and the middle class.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=11–12}}</ref> Northern and Western police departments were almost all white.<ref name="Bloom and Martin 2013 p.12">{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=12}}</ref> In 1966, only 16 of Oakland's 661 police officers were African American (less than 2.5%).<ref>McElrath, Jessica.

Civil rights tactics proved incapable of redressing these conditions, and the organizations that had "led much of the nonviolent civil disobedience", such as [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] and [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]], went into decline.<ref name="Bloom and Martin, 2013, p. 11" /> By 1966 a "Black Power ferment" emerged, consisting largely of young urban blacks, posing a question the Civil Rights Movement could not answer: "How would black people in America win not only formal citizenship rights, but actual economic and political power?"<ref name="Bloom and Martin 2013 p.12" /> Young black people in Oakland and other cities developed study groups and political organizations, and from this ferment the Black Panther Party emerged.<ref>{{harvnb|Murch|2010|pp=5–7}}</ref>

===Founding the Black Panther Party===
In late October 1966, [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]] founded the Black Panther Party (originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense). In formulating a new politics, they drew on their work with a variety of Black Power organizations.<ref>{{harvnb|Seale|1970|loc=part I}}; {{harvnb|Newton|1973|loc=parts 2-3}}; {{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|loc=chapter 1}}; {{harvnb|Murch|2010|loc=part II and chapter 5}}</ref> Newton and Seale first met in 1962 when they were both students at [[Merritt College]].<ref>{{harvnb|Seale|1970|p=13}}</ref> They joined Donald Warden's Afro-American Association, where they read widely, debated, and organized in an emergent black nationalist tradition inspired by [[Malcolm X]] and others.<ref>{{harvnb|Murch|2010|loc=chapter 3}}</ref> Eventually dissatisfied with Warden's accommodationism, they developed a revolutionary anti-imperialist perspective working with more active and militant groups like the Soul Students Advisory Council and the [[Revolutionary Action Movement]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141006105851/http://kasamaproject.org/race-liberation/2005-37black-like-mao-red-china-black-revolution-part-2 Robin D.

Dissatisfied with the failure of these organizations to directly challenge police brutality and appeal to the "brothers on the block", Huey and Bobby took matters into their own hands. After the police killed Matthew Johnson, an unarmed young black man in San Francisco, Newton observed the violent insurrection that followed. He had an epiphany that would distinguish the Black Panther Party from the multitude of [[Black Power]] organizations. Newton saw the explosive rebellious anger of the ghetto as a social force, and believed that if he could stand up to the police, he could organize that force into political power. Inspired by [[Robert F. Williams]]' armed resistance to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) and Williams' book ''[[Negroes with Guns]]'',<ref>[http://wsupress.wayne.edu/books/detail/negroes-guns "Negroes With Guns-Description"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082904/http://wsupress.wayne.edu/books/detail/negroes-guns |date=October 6, 2014}}, Wayne State University Press website.</ref> Newton studied [[gun laws in California]] extensively. Like the Community Alert Patrol in Los Angeles after the [[Watts riots|Watts Rebellion]], he decided to organize patrols to follow the police around to monitor for incidents of brutality. But with a crucial difference: his patrols would carry loaded guns.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=30–39}}</ref> Huey and Bobby raised enough money to buy two shotguns by buying bulk quantities of the recently publicized [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book]] and reselling them to leftist and liberals on the [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] campus at three times the price. According to Bobby Seale, they would "sell the books, make the money, buy the guns, and go on the streets with the guns. We'll protect a mother, protect a brother, and protect the community from the racist cops."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seale|first1=Bobby|title=Seize the Time: The Story of The Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton|isbn=978-0-933121-30-0|pages=79–83|year=1991}}</ref>

On October 29, 1966, [[Stokely Carmichael]] – a leader of SNCC – championed the call for "[[Black Power]]" and came to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to keynote a Black Power conference. At the time, he was promoting the armed organizing efforts of the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO) in Alabama and their use of the Black Panther symbol. Newton and Seale decided to adopt the Black Panther logo and form their own organization called the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=39–44}}</ref> Newton and Seale decided on a uniform of blue shirts, black pants, black leather jackets, black berets.<ref name="Pearson 109">{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=109}}</ref> Sixteen-year-old [[Bobby Hutton]] was their first recruit.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9015498/Black-Panther-Party|title=Black Panther Party|accessdate=March 27, 2008|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315144638/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9015498/Black-Panther-Party|archive-date=March 15, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

* October 15, 1966: The BPP is founded. A few months later, they begin their first police-watching patrols.<ref name="founded oct 15"/>
* January 1967: The BPP opens its first official headquarters in an Oakland storefront, and publishes the first issue of ''[[The Black Panther (newspaper)|The Black Panther: Black Community News Service]]''.
* February 1967: BPP members serve as [[bodyguard|security escorts]] for [[Betty Shabazz]].
* April 1967: [[Denzil Dowell]] protest in Richmond.
* May 2, 1967: Thirty people representing the BPP go to California state capitol with guns, attracting the Party's first national media attention.

====Oakland patrols of police====
The initial tactic of the party utilized contemporary [[Open carry in the United States|open-carry gun laws]] to protect Party members when policing the police. This act was done in order to record incidents of police brutality by distantly following police cars around neighborhoods.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=45}}</ref> When confronted by a police officer, Party members cited laws proving they had done nothing wrong and threatened to take to court any officer that violated their constitutional rights.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=46}}</ref> Between the end of 1966 to the start of 1967, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense's armed police patrols in Oakland black communities attracted a small handful of members.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=48}}</ref> Numbers grew slightly starting in February 1967, when the party provided an armed escort at the San Francisco airport for Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow and keynote speaker for a conference held in his honor.<ref name=":1">''Black Panther Newspaper'', May 15, 1967, p. 3; {{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=71–72}}</ref>

The Black Panther Party's focus on militancy was often construed as open hostility,<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|2006|pp=x-xxiii}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|pp=108–120}}</ref> feeding a reputation of violence even though early efforts by the Panthers focused primarily on promoting social issues and the exercise of their legal right to carry arms. The Panthers employed a California law that permitted carrying a loaded rifle or shotgun as long as it was publicly displayed and pointed at no one.<ref name="Pearson 109" /> Generally this was done while monitoring and observing police behavior in their neighborhoods, with the Panthers arguing that this emphasis on active militancy and openly carrying their weapons was necessary to protect individuals from police violence. For example, chants like "The Revolution has come, it's time to pick up the gun. Off the pigs!",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Age of Great Dreams: America in the 1960s|page=207 |author=David Farber}}</ref> helped create the Panthers' reputation as a violent organization.

====Rallies in Richmond, California====
The black community of [[Richmond, California]], wanted protection against police brutality.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=51}}</ref> With only three main streets for entering and exiting the neighborhood, it was easy for police to control, contain, and suppress the population.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=52}}</ref> On April 1, 1967, a black unarmed twenty-two-year-old construction worker named Denzil Dowell was shot dead by police in North Richmond.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=50}}</ref> Dowell's family contacted the Black Panther Party for assistance after county officials refused to investigate the case.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=52–53}}</ref> The Party held rallies in North Richmond that educated the community on armed self-defense and the Denzil Dowell incident.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=54–55}}</ref> Police seldom interfered at these rallies because every Panther was armed and no laws were broken.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=55}}</ref> The Party's ideals resonated with several community members, who then brought their own guns to the next rallies.<ref name="Bloom, Joshua 2013. p. 57">{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=57}}</ref>

====Protest at the Statehouse====
Awareness of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense grew rapidly after their May 2, 1967 protest at the California State Assembly. On May 2, 1967, the [[California State Assembly]] Committee on Criminal Procedure was scheduled to convene to discuss what was known as the "[[Mulford Act]]", which would make the public carrying of loaded firearms illegal. Newton, with Minister of Information [[Eldridge Cleaver]], put together a plan to send a group of 26 armed Panthers led by Seale from Oakland to Sacramento to protest the bill. The group entered the assembly carrying their weapons, an incident which was widely publicized, and which prompted police to arrest Seale and five others.

====United Front Against Fascism====
In July 1969 the BPP organized the [[United Front Against Fascism]] conference in Oakland, which was attended by around 5,000 people representing a number of groups.{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}}<ref name=spencer>{{cite web|url=https://dukeupress.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/the-black-panther-party-and-black-anti-fascism-in-the-united-states/|title=The Black Panther Party and Black Anti-fascism in the United States|date=January 26, 2017|accessdate=July 28, 2018|first=Robyn C.|last=Spencer|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221850/https://dukeupress.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/the-black-panther-party-and-black-anti-fascism-in-the-united-states/|archive-date=July 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

====COINTELPRO====
[[File:COINTELPRO - Jean Seberg.jpg|thumb|[[COINTELPRO]] document outlining the FBI's plans to 'neutralize' [[Jean Seberg]] for her support for the Black Panther Party, by attempting to publicly "cause her embarrassment" and "tarnish her image".]]
<!--This treatment is ok, but a bit eccentric. Needs significant revision.-->
In August 1967, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) instructed its program "[[COINTELPRO]]" to "neutralize ... black nationalist hate groups" and other dissident groups. In September 1968, FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] described the Black Panthers as "the greatest threat to the internal security of the country".<ref>Stohl, 249.</ref> By 1969, the Black Panthers and their allies had become primary COINTELPRO targets, singled out in 233 of the 295 authorized "[[Black nationalism|Black Nationalist]]" COINTELPRO actions.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_cointelpro.html "COINTELPRO" A Huey P. Newton Story] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515150914/http://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_cointelpro.html |date=May 15, 2011 }}, Public Broadcasting System website.</ref> The goals of the program were to prevent unification of militant black nationalist groups and to weaken their leadership, as well as to discredit them to reduce their support and growth. The initial targets included the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], the Revolutionary Action Movement and the [[Nation of Islam]], as well as leaders including the Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Stokely Carmichael]], [[H. Rap Brown]], Maxwell Stanford and [[Elijah Muhammad]].

COINTELPRO attempted to create rivalries between black nationalist factions, and to exploit existing ones. One such attempt was to "intensify the degree of animosity" between the Black Panthers and the [[Almighty Black P. Stone Nation|Blackstone Rangers]], a Chicago street gang. The FBI sent an anonymous letter to the Rangers' gang leader claiming that the Panthers were threatening his life, a letter whose intent was to provoke "preemptive" violence against Panther leadership. In Southern California, the FBI made similar efforts to exacerbate a "gang war" between the Black Panther Party and a black nationalist group called the [[US Organization]], allegedly sending a provocative letter to the US Organization to increase existing antagonism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/Chapter_History/BPP_Pieces_of_History.html|title=Black Panther Party Pieces of History: 1966–1969|publisher=Itsabouttimebpp.com|accessdate=August 27, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610064631/http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/Chapter_History/BPP_Pieces_of_History.html|archive-date=June 10, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

COINTELPRO also aimed to dismantle the Black Panther Party by targeting their social/community programs, most prominently Free Breakfast for Children. The success of Free Breakfast served to "shed light on the government's failure to address child poverty and hunger—pointing to the limits of the nation's War on Poverty".<ref name=":0"/> As the Party taught and provided for children more effectively than the government, the FBI denounced their efforts as a means of indoctrination. "Police and Federal Agents regularly harassed and intimidated program participants, supporters, and Party workers and sought to scare away donors and organizations that housed the programs like churches and community centers".<ref name=":0"/><ref>[http://www.civilrightsteaching.org/Handouts/BPPhandout.pdf "History of the Black Panther Party, Part Two" Civilrightsteaching.org/Teaching for Change.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031024002/http://www.civilrightsteaching.org/Handouts/BPPhandout.pdf |date=October 31, 2014 }}</ref>

====Huey Newton charged with murdering John Frey====
<!--More background is needed here on the state of the Party in late October, and the ideological and political developments following the passage of the Mulford Act in May after the Party's patrols were outlawed, and the way these changes set the stage for the Free Huey campaign.-->

Newton during a traffic stop in which Newton and backup officer Herbert Heanes also suffered gunshot wounds. Newton was convicted of voluntary manslaughter at trial, but the conviction was later overturned. In his book ''Shadow of the Panther'', writer Hugh Pearson alleges that Newton was intoxicated in the hours before the incident, and claimed to have willfully killed John Frey.<ref>{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|pp=7, 221}}</ref>

====Free Huey! campaign====
<!--This Section Needs Serious Revision-->
At the time, Newton claimed that he had been falsely accused, leading to the Party's "Free Huey!" campaign. The police killing gained the party even wider recognition by the radical American left.<ref>{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=3}}</ref> Newton was released after three years, when his conviction was reversed on appeal.<ref>December 15, 1971. "Case Against Newton Dropped". ''The Dispatch'' (Lexington, North Carolina) via UPI. Retrieved August 5, 2012.</ref>

As Newton awaited trial, the "Free Huey" campaign developed alliances with numerous students and anti-war activists, "advancing an anti-imperialist political ideology that linked the oppression of antiwar protestors to the oppression of blacks and Vietnamese".<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=110}}</ref> The "Free Huey" campaign attracted black power organizations, New Left groups, and other activist groups such as the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]], [[Bob Avakian]] of the Community for New Politics, and the Red Guard.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=104}}</ref> For example, the Black Panther Party collaborated with the [[Peace and Freedom Party]], which sought to promote a strong antiwar and antiracist politics in opposition to the establishment democratic party.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=107}}</ref> The Black Panther Party provided needed legitimacy to the Peace and Freedom Party's racial politics and in return received invaluable support for the "Free Huey" campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=109}}</ref>

====Founding of the L.A. Chapter====
<!--This section needs serious development-->
In 1968 the southern California chapter was founded by [[Bunchy Carter|Alprentice "Bunchy" Carter]] in Los Angeles. Carter was the leader of the Slauson street gang, and many of the LA chapter's early recruits were Slausons.<ref>Gerald Horne, ''Fire this Time: The Watts Uprising and the 1960s'', University of Virginia Press, 1995.</ref>

====Killing of Bobby Hutton====
[[Bobby Hutton]] was born April 21, 1950 in Jefferson County Arkansas. At the age of three, he and his family moved to Oakland, California after being harassed by racist vigilante groups associated with the Ku Klux Klan. In December 1966, he became the first treasurer and recruit of the Black Panther Party at the age of just 16 years old. He became the first member of the party to be killed by police.

On April 6, 1968, two days after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and with riots raging across cities in United States, the 17-year-old Hutton was traveling with Eldridge Cleaver and other BPP members in a car.&nbsp;The group confronted Oakland Police officers, then fled to an apartment building where they engaged in a 90-minute gun battle with the police. The standoff ended with Cleaver wounded and Hutton voluntarily surrendering.&nbsp;According to Cleaver, although Hutton had stripped down to his underwear and had his hands raised in the air to prove that he was unarmed, Oakland Police shot Hutton more than 12 times, killing him. Two police officers were also shot.

Although at the time the BPP claimed that the police had ambushed them, several party members later admitted that Cleaver had led the Panther group on a deliberate ambush of the police officers, provoking the shoot-out.<ref>Kate Coleman, 1980, [http://colemantruth.net/kate1.pdf "Souled Out: Eldridge Cleaver Admits He Ambushed Those Cops"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723044742/http://colemantruth.net/kate1.pdf|date=July 23, 2011}}.

In 1968, the group shortened its name to the Black Panther Party and sought to focus directly on political action. Members were encouraged to carry guns and to defend themselves against violence. An influx of college students joined the group, which had consisted chiefly of "brothers off the block". This created some tension in the group. Some members were more interested in supporting the Panthers' social programs, while others wanted to maintain their "street mentality".<ref>{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=175}}</ref>

By 1968, the Party had expanded into many U.S. cities, including [[Atlanta]], [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Dallas]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City]], [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[San Diego]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] Peak membership was near 5,000 by 1969, and [[The Black Panther (newspaper)|their newspaper]], under the editorial leadership of [[Eldridge Cleaver]], had a circulation of 250,000.<ref name="Black studies">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Black Studies|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediablac00maza|url-access=limited|last=Asante|first=Molefi K.|year=2005|publisher=Sage Publications Inc.|isbn=978-0-7619-2762-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediablac00maza/page/n164 135]–137}}</ref> The group created a [[Ten-Point Program]], a document that called for "Land, Bread, Housing, Education, Clothing, Justice and Peace", as well as exemption from [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] for black men, among other demands.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Huey|title=The Ten-Point Program|work=War Against the Panthers|publisher=Marxist.org|date=October 15, 1966|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/1966/10/15.htm|accessdate=June 5, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626134510/http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/1966/10/15.htm|archive-date=June 26, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> With the Ten-Point program, "What We Want, What We Believe", the Black Panther Party expressed its economic and political grievances.<ref>{{harvnb|Lazerow|Williams|2006|p=46}}</ref>

Curtis Austin states that by late 1968, Black Panther ideology had evolved from black nationalism to become more a "revolutionary internationalist movement":

{{quote|[The Party] dropped its wholesale attacks against whites and began to emphasize more of a class analysis of society. Its emphasis on Marxist–Leninist doctrine and its repeated espousal of Maoist statements signaled the group's transition from a revolutionary nationalist to a revolutionary internationalist movement. Every Party member had to study Mao Tse-tung's "Little Red Book" to advance his or her knowledge of peoples' struggle and the revolutionary process.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|2006|p=170}}</ref>}}

Panther slogans and iconography spread. At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], two American medalists, gave the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|black power salute]] during the American national anthem. The [[International Olympic Committee]] banned them from all future Olympic Games. Film star [[Jane Fonda]] publicly supported Huey Newton and the Black Panthers during the early 1970s. She actually ended up informally adopting the daughter of two Black Panther members, [[Mary Williams (activist)|Mary Luana Williams]]. Fonda and other Hollywood celebrities became involved in the Panthers' leftist programs. The Panthers attracted a wide variety of left-wing revolutionaries and political activists, including writer [[Jean Genet]], former ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine editor [[David Horowitz]] (who later became a major critic of what he describes as Panther criminality){{cn|date=July 2020}} and left-wing lawyer [[Charles Garry|Charles R. Garry]], who acted as counsel in the Panthers' many legal battles.

The BPP adopted a "Serve the People" program, which at first involved a free breakfast program for children. By the end of 1968, the BPP had established 38 chapters and branches, claiming more than five thousand members. Eldridge and [[Kathleen Cleaver]] left the country days before Cleaver was to turn himself in to serve the remainder of a thirteen-year sentence for a 1958 rape conviction. They settled in Algeria.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/27-important-facts-everyone-should-know-about-the-black-panthers_us_56c4d853e4b08ffac1276462|title=27 Important Facts Everyone Should Know About The Black Panthers|first1=Lilly |last1=Workneh |first2=Post |last2=Taryn |date=February 18, 2016|newspaper=The Huffington Post|access-date=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205091910/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/27-important-facts-everyone-should-know-about-the-black-panthers_us_56c4d853e4b08ffac1276462|archive-date=February 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

By the end of the year, party membership peaked at around 2,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|pp=173, 176}}</ref> Party members engaged in criminal activities such as extortion, stealing, violent discipline of BPP members, and robberies.

{{quote box|The Black Panther Party's free breakfast program is "the greatest threat to efforts by authorities to neutralize the BPP and destroy what it stands for."|source=FBI director J. Edgar Hoover{{r|Shames 2016}}|width=40em}}

Inspired by [[Mao Zedong]]'s advice to revolutionaries in ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|The Little Red Book]]'', Newton called on the Panthers to "serve the people" and to make "survival programs" a priority within its branches. The most famous of their programs was the [[Free Breakfast for Children|Free Breakfast for Children Program]], initially run out of an [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] church.

The Free Breakfast For Children program was especially significant because it served as a space for educating youth about the current condition of the Black community, and the actions that the Party was taking to address that condition. "While the children ate their meal[s], members [of the Party] taught them liberation lessons consisting of Party messages and Black history."<ref name=":0">{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=186}}</ref> Through this program, the Party was able to influence young minds, and strengthen their ties to communities as well as gain widespread support for their ideologies. The breakfast program became so popular that the Panthers Party claimed to have fed twenty thousand children in the 1968–69 school year.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=184}}</ref>

Other survival programs<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/blackpanthers/programs.shtml |title=Black Panther Party Community Programs 1966 - 1982 |access-date=April 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425174358/http://web.stanford.edu/group/blackpanthers/programs.shtml |archive-date=April 25, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> were free services such as clothing distribution, classes on politics and economics, free medical clinics, lessons on self-defense and first aid, transportation to upstate prisons for family members of inmates, an emergency-response ambulance program, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, and testing for [[Sickle cell disease|sickle-cell disease]].<ref name=westneat>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002270461_danny11.html|title=Reunion of Black Panthers stirs memories of aggression, activism|last=Westneat|first=Danny|date=May 11, 2005|work=[[Seattle Times]]|accessdate=March 31, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106035921/http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002270461_danny11.html|archive-date=November 6, 2013}}</ref> The free medical clinics were very significant because they modeled an idea of how the world might work with free medical care, eventually being established in 13 places across the country.

====Shoot-out with the US Organization====
Violent conflict between the Panther chapter in LA and the [[US Organization]], a black nationalist group, resulted in shootings and beatings, and led to the murders of at least four Black Panther Party members. On January 17, 1969, Los Angeles Panther Captain [[Bunchy Carter]] and Deputy Minister [[John Huggins]] were killed in Campbell Hall on the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] campus, in a gun battle with members of the US Organization. Another shootout between the two groups on March 17 led to further injuries. Two more Panthers died.

====Black Panther Party Liberation Schools====
Paramount to their beliefs regarding the need for individual agency in order to catalyze community change, the Black Panther Party (BPP) strongly supported the education of the masses. As part of their [[Ten-Point Program]] which set forth the ideals and goals of the party, they demanded an equitable education for all black people. Number 5 of the "What We Want Now!" section of the program reads: "We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present day society." In order to ensure that this occurred, the Black Panther Party took the education of their youth in their own hands by first establishing after-school programs and then opening up Liberation Schools in a variety of locations throughout the country which focused their curriculum on Black history, writing skills, and political science.<ref name="autogenerated221">Wahad, D. B., Abu-Jamal, M., Shakur, A., Fletcher, J., Jones, T., & Lotringer, S. (1993). ''Still Black, Still Strong: Survivors of the U.S. War Against Black Revolutionaries''. Semiotexte. pp. 221–242</ref>

'''Intercommunal Youth Institute'''

The first Liberation School was opened by the Richmond Black Panthers in July 1969 with brunch served and snacks provided to students. Another school was opened in Mt. Vernon New York on July 17 of the subsequent year.<ref name="autogenerated221" /> These schools were informal in nature and more closely resembled after-school or summer programs.<ref name="autogenerated171">Murch, D. J. (2010). ''Living for the City: Migration, Education, and the Rise of the Black Panther Party in Oakland, California''. pp. 171–185</ref> While these campuses were the first to open, the first full-time and longest-running Liberation school was opened in January 1971 in Oakland in response to the inequitable conditions in the Oakland Unified School District which was ranked one of the lowest scoring districts in California.<ref name="autogenerated168">Woodard, K., Theoharis, J., & Gore, D. F. (2009). ''Want to Start a Revolution?: Radical Women in the Black Freedom Struggle''. New York University Press. pp. 168–181</ref> Named the Intercommunal Youth Institute (IYI), this school, under the directorship of Brenda Bay, and later, [[Ericka Huggins]], enrolled twenty-eight students in its first year, with the majority being the children of Black Panther parents. This number grew to fifty by the 1973–1974 school year. In order to provide full support for Black Panther parents whose time was spent organizing, some of the students and faculty members lived together year around. The school itself was dissimilar to traditional schools in a variety of ways including the fact that students were separated by academic performance rather than age and students were often provided one on one support as the faculty to student ratio was 1:10.<ref name="autogenerated168" />

The Panther's goal in opening Liberation Schools, and specifically the Intercommunal Youth Institute, was to provide students with an education that wasn't being provided in the "white" schools,<ref name="autogenerated3">Programs. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://nhdblackpantherparty.weebly.com/programs.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202071612/https://nhdblackpantherparty.weebly.com/programs.html |date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> as the public schools in the district employed a eurocentric assimilationist curriculum with little to no attention to black history and culture. While students were provided with traditional courses such as English, Math, and Science, they were also exposed to activities focused on class structure and the prevalence of [[institutional racism]].<ref name="autogenerated1966">Liberation Schools.

One of them being critical thinking—that children should learn not what to think but how to think ... the school was an expression of the collective wisdom of the people who envisioned it. And it was ... a living thing [that] changed every year.<ref name="autogenerated171" /> Funding for the Intercommunal Youth Institute was provided through a combination of Black Panther fundraising and community support.<ref name="autogenerated168" />

'''Oakland Community School'''

In 1974, due to increased interest in enrolling in the school, school officials decided to move to a larger facility and subsequently changed the school's name to Oakland Community School. During this year, the school graduated its first class.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> Although the student population continued to grow ranging between 50 and 150 between 1974–1977, the original core values of individualized instruction remained.<ref name="autogenerated168" /> In September 1977, the school received a special award from Governor Edmund Brown Jr. and the California Legislature for "having set the standard for the highest level of elementary education in the state.<ref name="autogenerated3" />

The school eventually closed in 1982 due to governmental pressure on party leadership which caused insufficient membership and funds to continue running the school.<ref name="autogenerated168" />

====Killing of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark====
In Chicago, on December 4, 1969, two Panthers were killed when the Chicago Police raided the home of Panther leader [[Fred Hampton]]. The raid had been orchestrated by the police in conjunction with the FBI. Hampton was shot and killed, as was Panther guard [[Mark Clark (activist)|Mark Clark]]. A federal investigation reported that only one shot was fired by the Panthers, and police fired at least 80 shots.<ref>Ted Gregory, [https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-pantherraid-story-story.html "Black Panther Raid and the Death of Fred Hampton"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904133954/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-pantherraid-story-story.html |date=September 4, 2014}}, ''Chicago Tribune''.</ref> The only shot fired by the Panthers was from Mark Clark, who appeared to fire a single round determined to be the result of a reflexive death convulsion after he was immediately struck in the chest by shots from the police at the start of the raid.

Hampton was sleeping next to his pregnant fiancée, and was subsequently shot twice in the head at point blank range while unconscious. Coroner reports show that Hampton was drugged with a powerful barbiturate that night, and would have been unable to have been awoken by the sounds of the police raid.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&pg=PA672&dq=william+o+neal,+hampton,+drugged#v=onepage&q=william%20o%20neal%2C%20hampton%2C%20drugged "BPP, Chicago Branch"], ''Encyclopedia of African-American History'' (ABC-CLIO), p. 672.</ref> His body was then dragged into the hallway. He was 21 years old and unarmed at the time of his death. Seven other Panthers sleeping at the house at the time of the raid were then beaten and seriously wounded, then arrested under charges of aggravated assault and attempted murder of the officers involved in the raid. These charges would later be dropped.

Cook County State's Attorney [[Edward Hanrahan]] announced to the media later that the Panthers were first to shoot in the interaction and that they showed a "refusal to cease firing... when urged to do so several times." ''New York Times'' reporting would later demonstrate that this was not in fact the case and found a great deal of fake evidence being used by Chicago Police to assert their claims.<ref>John Kifner, "State’s Attorney in Chicago Makes Photographs of Black Panther Apartment Available," ''New York Times'', December 12, 1969.</ref>

Former FBI agent [[M. Wesley Swearingen|Wesley Swearingen]] asserts that the Bureau was guilty of a "plot to murder" the Panthers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/2010/fbikill.htm|title=Wes Swearigen on FBI Assassination of Fred Hampton|work=colorado.edu|accessdate=September 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904011339/http://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/2010/fbikill.htm|archive-date=September 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Hampton had been slipped the barbiturates which had left him unconscious by William O'Neal, who had been working as an FBI informant.

====Torture-murder of Alex Rackley====
In May 1969, three members of the New Haven chapter tortured and murdered [[Alex Rackley]], a 19-year-old member of the New York chapter, because they suspected him of being a police informant. Three party officers—[[Warren Kimbro]], [[George Sams, Jr.]], and [[Lonnie McLucas]]—later admitted taking part. Sams, who gave the order to shoot Rackley at the murder scene, turned state's evidence and testified that he had received orders personally from [[Bobby Seale]] to carry out the execution. Party supporters responded that Sams was himself the informant and an [[agent provocateur]] employed by the FBI.<ref>Edward Jay Epstein, [http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/panthers.htm "The Black Panthers and the Police: A Pattern of Genocide?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710003618/http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/panthers.htm |date=July 10, 2013}} ''New Yorker'', February 13, 1971.</ref> The case resulted in the [[New Haven Black Panther trials]] of 1970. Kimbro and Sams were convicted of the murder, but the trials of Seale and [[Ericka Huggins]] ended with a hung jury, and the prosecution chose not to seek another trial.

====International ties====
Activists from many countries around the globe supported the Panthers and their cause. In Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Finland, for example, left-wing activists organized a tour for Bobby Seale and Masai Hewitt in 1969. At each destination along the tour, the Panthers talked about their goals and the "Free Huey!" campaign. Seale and Hewitt made a stop in Germany as well, gaining support for the "Free Huey!" campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=313}}</ref>

===1970===
====Chronology====
* January 1970: [[Leonard Bernstein]] holds a fundraiser for the BPP, which was notoriously mocked by [[Tom Wolfe]] in ''[[Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers]]''.
* Spring 1970: The Oakland BPP engages in another ambush of police officers with guns and fragmentation bombs. Two officers are wounded.<ref>{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=201}}</ref>
* May 1970: Huey Newton's conviction is overturned, but he remains incarcerated.
* July 1970: Newton tells ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "we've never advocated violence".
* August 1970: Newton is released from prison.

In 1970, a group of Panthers traveled through [[Asia]] and they were welcomed as guests of the governments of [[North Vietnam]], [[North Korea]], and [[China]]. The group's first stop was in North Korea, where the Panthers met with local officials in order to discuss ways in which they could help each other fight against American imperialism. [[Eldridge Cleaver]] traveled to [[Pyongyang]] twice in 1969 and 1970, and following these trips he made an effort to publicize the writings and works of North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Benjamin|title=North Korea and the American Radical Left|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/north-korea-and-the-american-radical-left|work=NKIDP e-Dossier no. 14|publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center|accessdate=March 5, 2014|date=February 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511154855/http://wilsoncenter.org/publication/north-korea-and-the-american-radical-left|archive-date=May 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> After leaving North Korea, the group traveled to North Vietnam with the same agenda in mind: finding ways to put an end to American imperialism. Eldridge Cleaver was invited to speak to Black GIs by the North Vietnamese government. He encouraged them to join the Black Liberation Struggle by arguing that the United States government was only using them for its own purposes. Instead of risking their lives on the battlefield for a country that continued to oppress them, Cleaver believed that the black GIs should risk their lives in support of their own liberation. After leaving Vietnam, Cleaver met with the Chinese ambassador to Algeria in order to express their mutual animosity towards the American government.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=318–321}}</ref>

When Algeria held its first Pan-African Cultural Festival, they invited many important figures from the United States. Among the important figures invited to the festival were Bobby Seale and [[Eldridge Cleaver]]. The cultural festival allowed Black Panthers to network with representatives of various international anti-imperialist movements. This was a significant time, which led to the formation of the International Section of the Party.<ref>Marable, Manning; Agard-Jones, Vanessa (2008).

Eldridge also met with [[Yasser Arafat]], and gave a speech supporting the Palestinians and their goal of achieving liberation.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=314–317}}</ref>

===1971===
====Chronology====
* January 1971: Newton expels [[Geronimo Pratt]] who, since 1970, had been in jail facing a pending murder charge. Newton also expels two of the New York 21 and his own secretary, [[Connie Matthews]], who flee the country.
* February 1971: a fall-out between Newton and Cleaver ensues after they argue during a live broadcast link-up. Newton expels Cleaver and the entire international section from the party.
* Spring 1971: the Newton and Cleaver factions engage in retaliatory assassinations of each other's members, resulting in the deaths of four people.<ref name="ReferenceB">Donald Cox, "Split in the Party", ''New Political Science'', Vol. 21, No. 2, 1999.</ref>
* May 1971: Bobby Seale is acquitted of ordering the Rackley murder, and returns to Oakland.
* Mid-to-late 1971: nationally, hundreds of Party members quit the BPP.<ref>[[Peniel Joseph]], p. 268</ref>
* Late-September 1971: Newton visits and stays in China for 10 days.<ref name="ReferenceC">''Revolutionary Suicide'' Penguin classics Deluxe Edition, page 349</ref>

Newton focuses the BPP on the Party's Oakland school and various other social service programs. In early 1971, the BPP founded the "Intercommunal Youth Institute" in January 1971,<ref>Jones, Charles Earl, ''The Black Panther Reconsidered'', Black Classic Press, 1998, p. 186.</ref> with the intent of demonstrating how black youth ought to be educated. [[Ericka Huggins]] was the director of the school and Regina Davis was an administrator.<ref name="BrownElaine">{{harvnb|Brown|1993|p=391}}</ref> The school was unique in that it did not have grade levels but instead had different skill levels so an 11-year-old could be in second-level English and fifth-level science.<ref name="BrownElaine"/> Elaine Brown taught reading and writing to a group of 10- to 11-year-olds deemed "uneducable" by the system.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|1993|p=392}}</ref> The school children were given free busing; breakfast, lunch, and dinner; books and school supplies; children were taken to have medical checkups; many children were given free clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|1993|p=393}}</ref>

====Split====
Significant disagreements among the Party's leaders over how to confront ideological differences led to a split within the party. Certain members felt that the Black Panthers should participate in local government and social services, while others encouraged constant conflict with the police. For some of the Party's supporters, the separations among political action, criminal activity, social services, access to power, and grass-roots identity became confusing and contradictory as the Panthers' political momentum was bogged down in the [[Criminal justice#Criminal justice system|criminal justice system]]. These (and other) disagreements led to a split.

Some Panther leaders, such as [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[David Hilliard]], favored a focus on community service coupled with self-defense; others, such as [[Eldridge Cleaver]], embraced a more confrontational strategy. Eldridge Cleaver deepened the schism in the party when he publicly criticized the Party for adopting a "[[Reformism|reformist]]" rather than "[[revolutionary]]" agenda and called for Hilliard's removal. Cleaver was expelled from the Central Committee but went on to lead a splinter group, the [[Black Liberation Army]], which had previously existed as an underground paramilitary wing of the Party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/|title=Black Panther Party|author=Brian Baggins|work=marxists.org|accessdate=September 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408075155/http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/|archive-date=April 8, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

The split turned violent, as the Newton and Cleaver factions carried out retaliatory assassinations of each other's members, resulting in the deaths of four people.<ref name="ReferenceB" />

====Delegation to China====
In late September 1971, Huey P. Newton led a delegation to China and stayed for 10 days.<ref name="ReferenceC" /> At every airport in China, Huey was greeted by thousands of people waving copies of the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book]] and displaying signs that said "we support the Black Panther Party, down with US imperialism" or "we support the American people but the Nixon imperialist regime must be overthrown". During the trip the Chinese arranged for him to meet and have dinner with a [[North Korea|DPRK]] ambassador, a [[Tanzania]]n ambassador, and delegations from both [[North Vietnam]] and the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam]].<ref>''Revolutionary Suicide'' Penguin classics Deluxe Edition, page 351</ref> Huey was under the impression he was going to meet Mao Zedong, but instead had two meetings with the first Premier of the People's Republic of China [[Zhou Enlai]]. One of these meetings also included Mao Zedong's wife [[Jiang Qing]]. Huey described China as "a free and liberated territory with a socialist government".<ref>''Revolutionary Suicide'' Penguin classics Deluxe Edition, page 352</ref>

===1972–74===
====Chronology====
* Early 1972: Newton shuts down chapters around the country, and calls the key members to Oakland.
* Mid-1972: BPP members or supporters win a number of minor offices in the Oakland city elections.
* 1973: The BPP focuses nearly all of its resources on winning political power in the Oakland city government. Seale runs for mayor; [[Elaine Brown]] runs for city council. Both lose, and many Party members resign after the losses.
* Early 1974: Newton embarks on a major purge, expelling Bobby and John Seale, David and June Hilliard, Robert Bay, and numerous other top party leaders. Dozens of other Panthers loyal to Seale resigned or deserted.
* August 1974: Newton murders Kathleen Smith, a teenage prostitute. He flees to Cuba. Elaine Brown takes over the leadership in his absence.
* December 1974: Accountant Betty van Patter is murdered, after threatening to disclose irregularities in the Party's finances.

====Newton solidifies control and centralizes power in Oakland====
In 1972, the party began closing down dozens of chapters and branches all over the country, and bringing members and operations to Oakland. The political arm of the southern California chapter was shut down and its members moved to Oakland, although the underground military arm remained for a time.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{harvnb|Forbes|2006}}</ref> The underground remnants of the LA chapter, which had emerged from the Slausons street gang, eventually re-emerged as the [[Crips]], a street gang who at first advocated social reform before devolving into racketeering.<ref>Virginia Heffernan, "The Gangs of Los Angeles: Roots, Branches and Bloods", ''The New York Times'', February 6, 2007.</ref>

The party developed a five-year plan to take over the city of Oakland politically. Bobby Seale ran for mayor, Elaine Brown ran for city council, and other Panthers ran for minor offices. Neither Seale nor Brown were elected. A few Panthers won seats on local government commissions.

Minister of Education [[Raymond Hewitt|Ray "Masai" Hewitt]] created the Buddha Samurai, the party's underground security cadre in Oakland. Newton expelled Hewitt from the party later in 1972, but the security cadre remained in operation under the leadership of Flores Forbes. One of the cadre's main functions was to extort and rob drug dealers and after-hours clubs.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

====Newton indicted for violent crimes====
In 1974, Huey Newton and eight other Panthers were arrested and charged with assault on police officers. Newton went into exile in Cuba to avoid prosecution for the murder of Kathleen Smith, an eighteen-year-old prostitute. Newton was also indicted for pistol-whipping his tailor, Preston Callins. Although Newton confided to friends that Kathleen Smith was his "first nonpolitical murder", he was ultimately acquitted, after one witness's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had been smoking marijuana on the night of the murder, and another prostitute witness recanted her testimony.<ref>{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|pp=265, 286, 328}}</ref><ref name="Kelley, Ken 1989">Kelley, Ken.

===1974–77===
====The Panthers under Elaine Brown====
In 1974, as Huey Newton prepared to go into exile in Cuba, he appointed [[Elaine Brown]] as the first Chairwoman of the Party. Under Brown's leadership, the Party became involved in organizing for more radical electoral campaigns, including Brown's 1975 unsuccessful run for Oakland City Council.<ref name="Perkins, Margo V 2000. p. 5">Perkins, Margo V. ''Autobiography As Activism: Three Black Women of the Sixties''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2000, p. 5.</ref> The Party supported [[Lionel Wilson (politician)|Lionel Wilson]] in his successful election as the first black mayor of Oakland, in exchange for Wilson's assistance in having criminal charges dropped against Party member Flores Forbes, leader of the Buddha Samurai cadre.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

In addition to changing the Party's direction towards more involvement in the electoral arena, Brown also increased the influence of women Panthers by placing them in more visible roles within the previously male-dominated organization.

====Death of Betty van Patter====
Panther leader Elaine Brown hired [[Murder of Betty Van Patter|Betty Van Patter]] in 1974 as a bookkeeper. Van Patter had previously served as a bookkeeper for ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine, and was introduced to the Panther leadership by [[David Horowitz]], who had been the editor of ''Ramparts'' and a major fundraiser and board member for the Panther school.<ref>Horowitz, David (December 13, 1999) [http://www.salon.com/news/col/horo/1999/12/13/betty/index.html "Who killed Betty Van Patter?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219102002/http://www.salon.com/news/col/horo/1999/12/13/betty/index.html |date=December 19, 2005}} http://www.salon.com/1999/12/13/betty/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222101852/http://www.salon.com/1999/12/13/betty/ |date=December 22, 2015}} ''[http://www.salon.com/index.html Salon.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991113114228/http://www.salon.com/index.html |date=November 13, 1999}}.''</ref> Later that year, after a dispute with Brown over financial irregularities,<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|1993|pp=363–367}}</ref> Van Patter went missing on December 13, 1974. Some weeks later, her severely beaten corpse was found on a [[San Francisco Bay]] beach.

There was insufficient evidence for police to charge anyone with van Patter's murder, but the Black Panther Party leadership was "almost universally believed to be responsible".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=recDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT28#v=onepage Frank Browning.

===1977–82===
====Return of Huey Newton and the demise of the party====
In 1977, Newton returned from exile in Cuba, and received complaints from male members about the excessive power of women in the organization, who now outnumbered men. According to Elaine Brown, Newton authorized the physical punishment of school administrator Regina Davis for scolding a male coworker.

====Panthers attempt to assassinate a witness against Newton====
In October 1977 Flores Forbes, the party's assistant chief of staff, led a botched attempt to assassinate Crystal Gray, a key prosecution witness in Newton's upcoming trial, who had been present the day of Kathleen Smith's murder. After attacking the wrong house by mistake, the occupant returned fire and killed one of the Panthers, Louis Johnson, while the other two assailants escaped.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Gunmen Try To Kill Witness Against Black Panther Leader|journal=[[Regina Leader-Post|The Leader-Post]]|date=October 25, 1977}}</ref> One of them, Flores Forbes, fled to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Nevada, with the help of Panther paramedic Nelson Malloy. Fearing that Malloy would discover the truth behind the botched assassination attempt, Newton allegedly ordered a "house cleaning", and Malloy was shot and buried alive in the desert. Although permanently [[Paralysis|paralyzed]] from the waist down, Malloy escaped and told police that fellow Panthers Rollin Reid and Allen Lewis were behind his attempted murder.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/14/archives/coast-inquiries-pick-panthers-as-target-murder-attempted-murders.html|title=Coast Inquiries Pick Panthers As Target; Murder, Attempted Murders and Financing of Poverty Programs Under Oakland Investigation|journal=New York Times|date=December 14, 1977|first=Wallace|last=Turner|access-date=July 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723212803/https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/14/archives/coast-inquiries-pick-panthers-as-target-murder-attempted-murders.html|archive-date=July 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Newton denied any involvement or knowledge and said the events "might have been the result of overzealous party members".<ref name="The Odyssey of Huey Newton">{{cite magazine|magazine=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946144-1,00.html|title=The Odyssey of Huey Newton|date=November 13, 1978|access-date=March 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106200735/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946144-1,00.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Newton was ultimately acquitted of the murder of Kathleen Smith, after Crystal Gray's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had smoked marijuana on the night of the murder, and he was acquitted of assaulting Preston Callins after Callins refused to press charges.

The Black Panthers adopted a ''womanist'' ideology responding to the unique experiences of African-American women,<ref name="Blackmon2008">{{harvnb|Blackmon|2008|p=28}}</ref> emphasizing [[racism]] as more oppressive than [[sexism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blackmon|2008|p=2}}</ref> [[Womanism]] was a mix of black nationalism and the vindication of women,<ref name=Blackmon2008 />{{rp|20}} putting race and community struggle before the gender issue.<ref name=Blackmon2008 />{{rp|8}} Womanism posited that traditional feminism failed to include race and class struggle in its denunciation of male sexism<ref name=Blackmon2008 />{{rp|26}} and was therefore part of white hegemony.<ref name=Blackmon2008 />{{rp|21}} In opposition to some feminist viewpoints, womanism promoted a vision of gender roles: that men are not above women, but hold a different position in the home and community,<ref name=Blackmon2008 />{{rp|42}} so men and women must work together for the preservation of African-American culture and community.<ref name=Blackmon2008 />{{rp|27}}

Henceforth, the Party newspaper portrayed women as intelligent political revolutionaries, exemplified by members such as [[Kathleen Cleaver]], [[Angela Davis]] and [[Ericka Huggins|Erika Huggins]].<ref name=Lumsden2009 />{{rp|10}} The Black Panther Party newspaper often showed women as active participants in the armed self-defense movement, picturing them with children and guns as protectors of home, family and community.<ref name=Lumsden2009 />{{rp|2}}

Police killed or incarcerated many male leaders, but female Panthers were less targeted for much of the 1960s and 1970s. By 1968, women made up two-thirds of the party, while many male members were out of duty. In the absence of much of the original male leadership, women moved into all parts of the organization.<ref name=":0b"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/grggenl9&div=17&id=&page=|title=Whose Revolution is This - Gender's Divisive Role in the Black Panther Party Ninth Symposium Issue of Gender and Sexuality Law: Note 9 Georgetown Journal of Gender and the Law 2008|website=heinonline.org|access-date=October 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018213048/http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals%2Fgrggenl9&div=17&id=&page=|archive-date=October 18, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Roles included leadership positions, implementing community programs, and uplifting the black community.

Many women Panthers began to demand childcare to be able to fully participate in the organization. The Party responded by establishing on-site child development centers in multiple US chapters. "Childcare became largely a group activity", with children raised collectively, in accord with the Panther's commitment to collectivism and the African-American extended-family tradition.

===Gender dynamics===
In the beginning, recruiting women was a low priority for Newton and Seale.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alameen-Shavers|first=Antwanisha|date=Fall 2016|title=The Woman Question: Gender Dynamics within the Black Panther Party|journal= Spectrum: A Journal on Black Men|volume=5|pages=33–62|doi=10.2979/spectrum.5.1.03|s2cid=152211806}}</ref> Seale stated in an interview that Newton targeted "brothers who had been pimping, brothers who had been peddling dope, brothers who ain't gonna take no shit, brothers who had been fighting the pigs". Also, they didn't realize that women could help the fight until one came into an interest meeting asking about "female leadership".<ref name=":2b">{{Cite journal|last=Jennings|first=Regina|date=2001 |title=Africana Womanism in The Black Panther Party: A Personal Story|journal=The Western Journal of Black Studies|volume=25|pages=146–152}}</ref> Regina Jennings recalls that many male leaders had an "unchecked" sexism problem and her task was to "lift the bedroom out of their minds." She remembers overhearing members: "Some concluded that the FBI sent me, but the captain assured them with salty good humor that, 'She's too stupid to be from the FBI.' He thought my cover and my comments too honest, too loud, and too ridiculous to be serious." She recalls her days in Oakland, California as a teenager looking for something to do to add purpose to her life and to her community. She grew up around police brutality, so it was nothing new. Her goal in joining was "smashing racism" because she viewed herself as Black before she was a woman. In her community, that identity is what she felt held her back the most.<ref name=":2b" />

===Women's role===
The Black Panther Party was involved in many community projects as part of their organization. These projects included community outreach, like the breakfast program, education, and health programs.<ref name=":0b" /> In many cases women were the ones primarily involved with administering these types of programs.

From the beginning of the Black Panther Party education was a fundamental goal of the organization. This was highlighted in the Ten Point Platform, the newspaper that was distributed by the party, and the public commentary shared by the Panthers.<ref name=":0b" /> The newspaper was one of the primary and original consciousness raising and educational measures taken by the party.<ref name=":0b" /> Despite the fact that men were out distributing the newspaper, women like Elaine Brown and Kathleen Cleaver were behind the scenes working on those papers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Liberation, Imagination and the Black Panther Party: A new look at the Panthers and their legacy|last1=Cleaver|first1=Kathleen|last2=Katsiaficas |publisher=Routledge|year=2001|location=New York}}</ref>

===Elaine Brown===
[[Elaine Brown]] rose to power within the BPP as Minister of Information after [[Eldridge Cleaver]] fled abroad. In 1974, she became chair for the Oakland chapter. She was appointed by [[Huey P.

===Gwen Robinson===
In an interview with Judson Jeffries, Gwen Robinson reflects on her time in the Black Panther Party Detroit Division.<ref name=":1b">{{Cite journal|last=Jeffries|first=Judson L.|date=Fall 2016|title=Conversing with Gwen Robinson|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/634852|journal= Spectrum: A Journal on Black Men|volume=5|pages=137–145|doi=10.2979/spectrum.5.1.07|s2cid=185337572|access-date=June 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620001918/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/634852|archive-date=June 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She explains that she joined in October 1969 with despite doubts from her mother, who had participated in a march with Martin Luther King Jr. in the early part of the decade. She chose the Black Panther Party (BBP) because "[She] felt a closeness and a bond with them" more than other organizations like the "[[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], [[NAACP]], the [[National Urban League|Urban League]], the [[Nation of Islam]], Shrines of Madonna, Eastside Voice of Independent Detroit (ESVID), the [[Republic of New Afrika|Republic of New Africa]], and the [[Revolutionary Action Movement]]."<ref name=":1b" />

In 12th grade, she decided to work full-time with the Party, dropping out of chaotic [[Denby High School]] in Detroit. "There were some students who would use the N word freely" and "a P.E. instructor accused [her] of stealing her keys." She was  "shoved" into the pool when she refused to swim for fear of wetting her hair, while a White teacher who taught Afro-American history would kick people out "if you challenged his position on certain Black leaders."<ref name=":1b" />

In the BBP, she "was living as part of a collective" where all work was shared, and she enjoyed working all day selling newspapers. She climbed the ranks and became the branch's Communications Secretary in January 1971, after her predecessor left due to "some issues related to [[sexism]]". In this branch, unlike the average BBP divisions, the "brothers" never turned violent or physical: "That kind of thing didn't take place in Detroit." She left the organization in 1973, keeping a link through her husband, their circulation manager. Summing up the legacy of the Detroit branch, she says, "It's crucial that people realize that the strength of the organization was rooted in discipline, deep commitment, and a genuine love for the people."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jeffries|first=Judson|date=Fall 2016|title=Conversing with Gwen Robinson|journal= Spectrum: A Journal on Black Men|volume=5|pages=137–145|doi=10.2979/spectrum.5.1.07|s2cid=185337572}}</ref>

==Aftermath and legacy==

There is considerable debate about the impact of the Black Panther Party on the wider society, or even their local environments. Author Jama Lazerow writes:

{{quote|As inheritors of the discipline, pride, and calm self-assurance preached by [[Malcolm X]], the Panthers became national heroes in black communities by infusing abstract nationalism with street toughness—by joining the rhythms of black working-class youth culture to the interracial élan and effervescence of Bay Area New Left politics&nbsp;... In 1966, the Panthers defined Oakland's ghetto as a territory, the police as interlopers, and the Panther mission as the defense of community. The Panthers' famous "policing the police" drew attention to the spatial remove that White Americans enjoyed from the police brutality that had come to characterize life in black urban communities.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mi2G28ZcmvsC&q=%22policing%20of%20the%20police%22&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=%22policing%20of%20the%20police%22 Lazerow & Williams (2006). p. 37]</ref>}}

Numerous former Panthers have held elected office in the United States, some into the 21st century; these include [[Charles Barron]] (New York City Council), Nelson Malloy (Winston-Salem City Council), and [[Bobby Rush]] (US House of Representatives).
