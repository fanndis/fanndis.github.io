'''John M. Geddes''' is an American journalist who served as one of two managing editors of ''[[The New York Times]]''.  He was appointed to that post in 2003, and left it in 2013.

Geddes served as managing editor for news operations (his co-managing editor was [[Dean Baquet]], later appointed executive editor), with responsibilities including production, budgeting and staffing. He and [[Jill Abramson]] (formerly executive editor) were appointed to their positions by then-executive editor [[Bill Keller]] to succeed former managing editor [[Gerald M. Boyd]]. Boyd stepped down on June 5, 2003, along with the paper's former executive editor, [[Howell Raines]], in the wake of the [[Jayson Blair]] scandal.<ref name="appoint">Steinberg, Jacques (01 August 2003).
