'''Yu Shyi-kun''' ({{zh|t=游錫堃}}; born 25 April 1948), also romanized '''You Si-kun''', is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] politician serving as a member and the [[president of the Legislative Yuan]]. He led the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) as chairman from 2006 to 2007. He previously served as [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] from 2002 to 2005. As one of the founding members of the DPP, he is seen as a loyalist of President [[Chen Shui-bian]]. He is a strong advocate of [[Taiwan independence]].

==Personal background==
Born in Taihe Village (太和村), [[Dongshan, Yilan|Dongshan Township]], [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]], Yu was raised in a poor [[tenant farming]] family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2002/bio_yu.htm |title=Yu Shyi-kun |publisher=Government Information Office |accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref> When he was 13, he studied at the Taiwan provincial Yilan High school (which today is the [[National Yilan Senior High School]]), his house was destroyed by flood waters during [[1961 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Pamela|typhoon Pamela]], and his father died of [[tuberculosis]] in the same year. He quit junior high school to work full-time on his family farm.

At 19, he studied at the supplementary night school of the Lotung Commercial High School. He moved to [[Taipei]] to enroll in the supplementary school of the Hsihu Commercial and Industrial High School. He studied international commerce at the [[Chihlee Institute of Technology]] (致理商專) and public administration at the [[National Chung Hsing University]]. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in politics in [[Tunghai University]] in 1985 at the age of 37.

==Rise in politics==
In 1981 he was elected a member of the [[Taiwan Provincial Assembly]] for Yilan County. Yu, [[Su Tseng-chang]], and {{ill|Hsieh San-sheng|zh|謝三升}} made the so-called "iron triangle" in the Assembly. The three were the only members ever to resign from the Assembly.

From 1983 to 1984 he was the [[Tangwai]] Secretary-General. He became Convener of Tangwai National Election Backing Committee in 1986. As a founding member of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], he was a member of its Central Committee from 1984 to 1986 and its [[Central Standing Committee]] from 1986 to 1990 when he was elected the Magistrate of Yilan County, during which he was a member of the Educational Reform Committee of the Executive Yuan from 1994 to 1996. In his second term as magistrate, Environmental Protection (環保立縣), Tourism (觀光立縣), Information Promotion (資訊立縣), and Culture (文化立縣) were his four main goals in administration. The successful planning and execution let him ranked the first one of 27 mayors/magistrates in Taiwan. After the completion of his two terms as magistrate in 1997, he was in 1998 appointed Chairman of the [[Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation]] by then Mayor [[Chen Shui-bian]]. He resigned in 1999 to become Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party.

He was the chief spokesman for the DPP campaign in the [[2000 ROC presidential election|2000 presidential election]]. With Chen Shui-bian's election to the [[president of the Republic of China|presidency]], he was appointed Vice Premier under Premier [[Tang Fei]].

In July 2000, four construction workers were trapped by the rising floodwaters of Pachang Creek. As local and central government authorities squabbled for three hours over who would send out a rescue helicopter, the men drowned. In the public outrage that ensued, officials up the chain of command, including Premier Tang, tendered their resignations. Vice Premier Yu, who was also chairman of the Committee of Disaster Relief and Prevention, had his resignation accepted.

Six months later, Yu rejoined the administration as Secretary-General to the Office of the President and served until his promotion to the premiership on February 1, 2002.

== Premiership ==
As premier, Yu defended the administration's position on the [[2004 ROC referendum|peace referendum]] and promoted a NT$610.8 billion arms procurement package in 2004. He caused some minor controversy when he used the designation "Taiwan, ROC" on an official visit to Honduras. Chen later said he preferred "Taiwan." In September 2004, he directed the government to refer to the People's Republic of China in official documents as simply "China" as opposed to "[[mainland China]]" or "Communist China" as was previously done in order to highlight a "separate Taiwanese identity." This move was not endorsed by the Presidential Office and the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] clarified that it would only apply to internal documents.
 
Yu and his cabinet resigned ''en masse'' following the pan-Green Coalition failure to gain a majority in the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|2004 legislative elections]]. In the ensuing cabinet shuffle, Yu was returned to the presidential office as secretary-general and succeeded as premier by [[Frank Hsieh]].

On January 15, 2006 he was elected chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party with 54% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4613796.stm |title=Taiwan's top party picks new boss |publisher=BBC
|date = January 15, 2006 |accessdate = 2007-11-02}}</ref>

Yu was a candidate for the DPP nomination for the [[2008 ROC presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. He secured 22,211 of the 140,720 votes, and declared his withdrawal in favor of former premier [[Frank Hsieh]], who won 62,849 votes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chinapost.com.tw/latestnews/200757/45953.htm |title = Frank Hsieh wins DPP primaries |work=The China Post |location=Taiwan |date= May 7, 2007 |accessdate= 2007-11-02}}</ref>

== Corruption charges and acquittal ==
On September 21, 2007, Yu, along with Vice President [[Annette Lu]] and National Security Office secretary-general [[Mark Chen]], were separately indicted on charges of corruption by the Supreme Prosecutor's Office of Taiwan.<ref name="washingtonpost_corruption">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/21/AR2007092102110.html |title=Taiwan's Vice President, 2 Others Charged With Corruption |author=Jane Rickards |work=The Washington Post |date=September 22, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref> Yu was accused of embezzlement and special fund abuse of about US$70,000. He resigned his post as chairperson of the Democratic Progressive Party later that day.<ref name="washingtonpost_corruption"/>  On July 2, 2012, all three were acquitted of all charges.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/201207020042|title=Former vice president found not guilty of special fund abuse|date=July 2, 2012|work=[[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Central News Agency]]|access-date=April 25, 2020|last1=Huang|first1=Yi-han|last2=Chen|first2=Ann}}</ref>

==2014 New Taipei City mayoralty election==
On 29 November 2014, Yu lost the [[2014 Taiwan local elections|New Taipei City mayoralty election]] to his opponent [[Eric Chu]] of the [[Kuomintang]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pan |first1=Jason |title=Eric Chu survives with razor-thin majority |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/11/30/2003605659 |accessdate=9 May 2020 |work=Taipei Times |date=30 November 2014}}</ref>
