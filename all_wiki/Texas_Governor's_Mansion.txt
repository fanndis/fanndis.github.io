The '''Texas Governor's Mansion''', is a historic home for the [[Governor of Texas]] in downtown [[Austin, Texas]]. Designed by prominent architect [[Abner Cook]], it was built in 1854 and has been the home of every governor since 1856. Governor [[Greg Abbott]] and First Lady [[Cecilia Abbott|Cecilia Phalen Abbott]] are the current residents.

On June 8, 2008, while midway through a major renovation, the mansion was badly damaged by an arson fire started with a [[Molotov cocktail]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==History==
The mansion is the oldest continuously inhabited house in Texas and fourth oldest governor's mansion in the [[United States]] that has been continuously occupied by a chief executive. The mansion was the first-designated Texas historic landmark, in 1962.<ref name="nrhpinv2">{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: The Governor's Mansion|url={{NHLS url|id=70000896}} |format=pdf|date=August 14, 1974 |author=Chambers, Allen |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=70000896|title=''Accompanying three photos, exterior and interior, from 1966 and 1975''|photos=y}}&nbsp;{{small|(32&nbsp;KB)}}</ref> It was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as "Governor's Mansion" in 1970, and further was declared a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1974.

==Original architecture==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}
Built by [[Abner Cook]] in a [[Greek Revival]] style and completed in 1856, the building occupies the center of a block and is surrounded by trees and gardens. The original mansion was {{convert|6000|sqft|m2}}. Remodeling in 1914 increased the size of the mansion to 8,920 square feet. The original mansion had 11 rooms but no bathrooms. The remodeling brought the room count to 25 rooms and 7 bathrooms. In 1931, at the recommendation of former Texas First Lady [[Mildred Paxton Moody]], the [[Forty-second Texas Legislature]] established the Board of Mansion Supervisors to oversee all interior and exterior upkeep and enhancements to the mansion. Mrs. Moody was the first head of the Board, which was abolished in 1965.

The mansion was partially destroyed by a [[four-alarm fire]] during the early morning of June 8, 2008. Then-Governor [[Rick Perry]] and his wife [[Anita Thigpen Perry]] were in Europe at the time of the fire. They had relocated in October 2007 for a $10 million major deferred maintenance project that began in January 2008. The project was to include a fire suppression system. State [[Fire Marshal]] Paul Maldonado said the next Sunday that investigators had evidence that an arsonist targeted the 152-year-old building.

On February 2, 2011, Chief Tony Leal, an assistant director of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], announced that a person of interest has been identified that is connected to an Austin-based anarchist group which has also been linked to an attack (involving Molotov cocktails) which was planned for the Republican National Convention in St. Paul during September 2008.

No one has ever been charged and there has never been any evidence linking anarchist involvement to date. An official close to the investigation said agents determined the fire was a criminal act "after reviewing footage from security cameras." To date the crime has gone unclaimed. A restoration was begun, with a scheduled completion in 2012.

In May 2009, $22 million was allocated to the restoration of the Governor's Mansion, $11 million of which came from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].  An additional $3.4 million has been raised through private fund raising.

The restoration area, which includes the mansion and the adjacent segment of Colorado Street, has been closed to the public with a [[chain-link fence]] and [[barbed wire]].
