'''William Sebastian Cohen''' (born August 28, 1940) is an [[Politics of the United States|American politician]], lawyer and author from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Cohen served as both a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] (1973–1979) and [[United States Senate|Senate]] (1979–1997), and as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] (1997–2001) under [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].<ref name="Historical Office William S. Cohen">{{cite web |url=http://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/Article-View/Article/571281/william-s-cohen/ |title=William S. Cohen - William J. Clinton Administration |work=Office of the Secretary of Defense - Historical Office}}</ref>

Described as "a Republican moderate from Maine, something of a maverick centrist" by [[David Halberstam]], Cohen had very good working relations with President Clinton and National Security Adviser [[Sandy Berger]] and "almost ideal" collaboration with the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]];<ref name="stevenson">Charles A. Stevenson, SECDEF: The Nearly Impossible Job of Secretary of Defense, pp. 105–114, Potomac Books, 2006</ref> however, he often clashed with Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]], whom he saw as "a grandstander, too outspoken on policy matters and too eager to use military force".<ref name="stevenson"/>

==Early life and education==
Cohen was born in [[Bangor, Maine]]. His mother, Clara (née Hartley), was of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Protestant Irish]] ancestry, and his father, Reuben Cohen, was born in New York and was the son of a [[Russian Jewish]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]];<ref>Clarion-Ledger
Jackson, Mississippi, 08 Jul 1979, Sun, Page 22</ref> the two owned the Bangor Rye Bread Co.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2008/05/12/mother_of_former_maine_senator_clara_cohen_dies/ |title=Mother of former Maine senator, Clara Cohen, dies |publisher=Boston.com |date=May 12, 2008 |accessdate=June 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725131922/http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2008/05/12/mother_of_former_maine_senator_clara_cohen_dies/ |archivedate=July 25, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.today.com/health/love-black-white-explores-race-wbna17237962 |title='Love in Black and White' explores race - Relationships|publisher=Today.com|date=February 20, 2007 |accessdate=June 11, 2009}}</ref>

Pursuant to his father's wishes, Cohen was raised Jewish and attended Hebrew School in preparation for his [[bar mitzvah]], but he decided not to follow through with his bar mitzvah when he was informed that he would have to convert formally to Judaism, and he began to practice Christianity.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ACTF56SnaykC&printsec=frontcover |last = Stone |first = Kurt F. |title = The Jews of Capitol Hill: A Compendium of Jewish Congressional Members |year = 2011 |page = 3 |isbn =9780810857315}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=William Sebastian Cohen|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/us-history-biographies/william-sebastian-cohen|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography -- The Gale Group Inc.|accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref>

After graduating from [[Bangor High School (Maine)|Bangor High School]] in 1958, Cohen attended [[Bowdoin College]], graduating ''[[Latin honors|cum laude]]'' with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[Latin language|Latin]] in 1962.  While a student at Bowdoin, Cohen was initiated as a brother of the Kappa chapter of the [[Psi Upsilon]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Distinguished Alumni|url=http://www.psiu.org/alum/distinguishedalumni.html|publisher=Psi Upsilon Fraternity|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}</ref>

While in high school and college, Cohen was a [[basketball]] player and was named to the Maine all-state high school and college basketball team, and at Bowdoin was inducted into the New England All-Star Hall of Fame. Cohen attended [[law school]] at the [[Boston University School of Law]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree ''cum laude'' in 1965.

==Legal, academic, and early political career==
He became an assistant county attorney for [[Penobscot County, Maine|Penobscot County]] (1968–1970). In 1968 he became an instructor at [[Husson College]] in Bangor, and later was an instructor in [[business administration]] at the [[University of Maine]] (1968–1972).

Cohen served as the vice president of the Maine Trial Lawyers Association (1970–1972) and as a member of the Bangor School Board (1971–1972). He became a [[fellow]] at the [[Kennedy School of Government|John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics at Harvard University]] in 1972, and in 1975 was named as one of the [[United States Junior Chamber|U.S. Jaycee's]] "ten outstanding young men".

Cohen was elected to the Bangor City Council (1969–1972) and served as Bangor Mayor in 1971–1972.

==House of Representatives and Senate==
In the [[United States House election, 1972|1972 election]], Cohen won a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], representing [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]], succeeding [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[William Hathaway]], who was elected to the US Senate. Cohen defeated Democratic State Senator [[Elmer H. Violette]] of Van Buren.

[[File:Senator William Cohen (R-ME).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Senator William Cohen early in his career]]
During his first term in Congress, Cohen became deeply involved in the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] investigation. As a member of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]], he was one of the first Republicans to break with his party, and voted for the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] of President [[Richard Nixon]]. During this time, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named him one of "America's 200 Future Leaders". In July 1974 he said,

{{quote|I have been faced with the terrible responsibility of assessing the conduct of a President that I voted for, believed to be the best man to lead this country. But a President who in the process by act or acquiescence allowed the rule of law and the Constitution to slip under the boots of indifference and arrogance and abuse.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Fateful Vote to Impeach |author=<!--TIME staff; no by-line.--> |url=https://time.com/3079519/the-fateful-vote-to-impeach/ |date=August 5, 1974  |volume=104 |issue=6 |magazine=Time |publisher=Time Inc. |location=New York, New York |accessdate=November 15, 2019}}</ref>}}

After three terms in the House, Cohen was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1978, defeating incumbent [[William Hathaway]] in his first bid for reelection. Cohen was reelected in 1984 and 1990, serving a total of 18 years in the Senate (1979–1997). In 1990, he defeated Democrat [[Neil Rolde]]. Cohen developed a reputation as a moderate Republican with liberal views on social issues, and has been described as "a career-long maverick with a reputation for fashioning compromise out of discord."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/admin/stories/cohen120696.htm |title=Republican Cohen Equally at Home With Policy and Poesy |last1=Priest |first1=Dana |last2=Dewar |first2=Helen Dewar |work=The Washington Post |date=December 6, 1996 |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/01/22/an-outsider-set-to-take-over-pentagon/070867aa-70a7-4ed3-bfdb-c1f162e9f507/ |title=An 'Outsider' Set to Taker Over Pentagon |first=Dana |last=Priest |date=January 22, 1997|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

In 1994 Cohen investigated the federal government's process for acquiring information technology, and his report, ''Computer Chaos: Billions Wasted Buying Federal Computer Systems'', generated much discussion. He chose not to run for another Senate term in 1996; [[Susan Collins]], who had worked for Cohen, was elected to succeed him.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/maine-senators-may-not-like-each-other-much-but-they-share-love-of-state-job/2011/05/03/AFGwpn0F_story.html |title=Maine senators may not like each other much, but they share love of state, job |first=Martha |last=Sherrill |date=May 5, 2011 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

While in the Senate, Cohen served on both the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Governmental Affairs Committee]] (1979–1997) and was a member of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]] 1983–1991 and again 1995–1997, serving as Vice Chairman from 1987 to 1991.<ref name=Cohen1997WP>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/admin/cohen.htm |title=William S.

Bill of Rights)|Montgomery G.I. Bill Act]] (1984), the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]] (1986), the Intelligence Oversight Reform Act (1991), the [[Federal Acquisition Reform Act]] (1996), the Nunn–Cohen Act Amendment creating the [[United States Special Operations Command]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/from-world-war-ii-to-nunn-cohen-socom-history-part-1/ |title=From World War II to Nunn-Cohen |last=Zimmerman |first=Dwight Jon |date=August 25, 2010 |website=defensemedianetwork.com|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref> and the [[Information Technology Management Reform Act]], also known as the [[Clinger–Cohen Act]] (1996). Cohen voted in favor of the [[Passage of Martin Luther King Jr. Day|bill]] establishing [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] as a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday]] and the [[Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987]] (as well as to override [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]]'s veto).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/98-1983/s293|title=TO PASS H.R. 3706.

==Secretary of Defense==
On December 5, 1996, President [[Bill Clinton]] announced his selection of Cohen as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], saying that he was the "right person" to build on the achievements of (retiring defense secretary) [[William Perry]] "to secure the bipartisan support America's armed forces must have and clearly deserve." As Secretary of Defense Cohen played a large role in directing the United States military actions in [[Iraq]] and [[Kosovo]], including the dismissal of [[Wesley Clark]] from his post as the [[NATO]] [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Supreme Allied Commander]]. Both [[Operation Desert Fox]] in Iraq and [[Operation Allied Force]] in Kosovo were launched just months after [[al-Qaeda]] carried out the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|United States embassy bombings]] in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], in 1998.

===Confirmation===

[[File:Clinton and Cohen meeting at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|upright|Cohen and President [[Bill Clinton]] at [[The Pentagon]], September 1997]]
During his confirmation hearings, Cohen said he thought on occasion he might differ with Clinton on specific national security issues. He implicitly criticized the Clinton administration for lacking a clear strategy for leaving [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and stated that he thought U.S. troops should definitely be out by mid-1998. He also asserted that he would resist further budget cuts, retain the two regional conflicts strategy, and support spending increases for advanced weapons, even if it necessitated further cuts in military personnel. Cohen questioned whether savings from [[Base Realignment and Closure|base closings]] and acquisition reform could provide enough money for procurement of new weapons and equipment that the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] thought necessary in the next few years. He supported the expansion of NATO and looked on the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]] as the most serious problem the United States faced.

[[File:HowardCohen97.jpg|thumb|Cohen and [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] at [[The Pentagon]], June 27, 1997]]
After [[Advice and consent|confirmation]] by a unanimous Senate vote, Cohen was sworn in as the 20th Secretary of Defense on January 24, 1997, becoming the first Republican politician to serve a Democratic president in this capacity.<ref name=Cohen1997WP/> He then settled into a schedule much fuller than he had followed in the Senate. Routinely he arrived at the Pentagon before 7 a.m., received an intelligence briefing, and then met with the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] ([[John Hamre]] 1997–2000, [[Rudy de Leon]] 2000–01) and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (Gen. [[Hugh Shelton]]). The rest of the day he devoted to policy and budget briefings, visits with foreign and other dignitaries, and to what he termed "ABC" meetings at the White House with [[Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Sandy Berger]] as well as President [[Bill Clinton]]. He also traveled abroad several times during his first months in office.

===Defense budget===
One of Cohen's first major duties was to present to [[United States Congress|Congress]] the Fiscal Year 1998 Defense budget, which had been prepared under Secretary Perry. Cohen requested a budget of $250.7 billion, which represented 3 percent of the nation's estimated gross domestic product for FY 1998. Cohen stressed three top budget priorities: people (recruiting and retaining skilled people through regular military pay raises, new construction or modernization of barracks, and programs for child care, family support, morale, welfare, and recreation), readiness (support for force readiness, training, exercises, maintenance, supplies, and other essential needs), and modernization (development and upgrading of weapon and supporting systems to guarantee the combat superiority of U.S. forces). This meant increasing the funds available for procurement of new systems, with the target set at $60 billion by FY2001.

When he presented the FY1998 budget, Cohen noted that he would involve himself with the [[Quadrennial Defense Review]] (QDR), which would focus on the challenges to U.S. security and the nation's military needs over the next decade or more. When the QDR became public in May 1997, it did not fundamentally alter the budget, structure, and doctrine of the military. Many defense experts thought it gave insufficient attention to new forms of warfare, such as terrorist attacks, electronic sabotage, and the use of chemical and biological agents. Cohen stated that the Pentagon would retain the "two regional wars" [[Scenario planning|scenario]] adopted after the end of the [[Cold War]]. He decided to scale back purchases of [[Fighter aircraft|jet fighters]], including the Air Force's [[F-22 Raptor]] and the Navy's [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], as well as Navy surface ships. The review included cutting another 61,700 active duty service members—15,000 in the [[United States Army|Army]], 26,900 in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], 18,000 in the [[United States Navy|Navy]], and 1,800 in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], as well as 54,000 reserve forces, mainly in the [[Army National Guard]], and some 80,000 civilians department-wide. Cohen also recommended two more rounds of base closings in 1999 and 2001. The Pentagon hoped to save $15 billion annually over the next few years to make possible the purchase of new equipment and weapon systems without a substantial budget increase above the current level of $250 billion.

===International relations and situations===
[[File:William Cohen and S. R. Nathan at the Istana, Singapore.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Cohen and [[Sellapan Ramanathan]]]]
[[File:U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen in South Korea, January 1998.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Cohen, General [[John H. Tilelli, Jr.]], Commander in Chief, United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command/U.S. Forces]]

As he settled into office, Cohen faced the question of the expansion of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], which he supported, and its relationship to Russia. At a summit meeting between President Clinton and [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], in March 1997, Yeltsin acknowledged the inevitability of broader NATO membership. Two months later he agreed, after negotiations with NATO officials, to sign an accord providing for a new permanent council, to include Russia, the NATO secretary general, and a representative of the other NATO nations, to function as a forum in which Russia could air a wide range of security issues that concerned that country. Formal signing of this agreement would pave the way for a July 1997 invitation from NATO to several nations, probably including [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and the [[Czech Republic]], to join the organization.

The proposed U.S. [[missile defense]] system received attention at the Helsinki summit, where Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to an interpretation of the 1972 [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] allowing the United States to proceed with a limited missile defense system currently under development. Specifically, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to distinguish between a national missile defense system, aimed against strategic weapons, not allowed by the ABMT, and a theater missile defense system to guard against shorter range missile attacks. Some critics thought that any agreement of this kind would place undesirable limits on the development of both theater and strategic missile defenses. The Helsinki meeting also saw progress in arms control negotiations between the United States and Russia, a matter high on Cohen's agenda. Yeltsin and Clinton agreed on the need for early Russian ratification of the [[START I|Second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] (START II) and negotiation of [[START III]] to make further significant cuts in the strategic nuclear arsenals of both nations.

[[File:Yoshiro Mori meets William Cohen 2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Cohen (left) and Japanese Prime Minister [[Yoshiro Mori]] pose for photographers prior to their meeting at the [[Kantei]] building in Tokyo, Japan, on September 22, 2000.]]

The continuation, at least until mid-1998, of the existing peacekeeping mission involving U.S. forces in Bosnia and the possibility that other such missions would arise worried Cohen, who earlier had expressed reservations about such operations. Humanitarian efforts that did not involve peacekeeping, such as in [[Rwanda]] in the recent past, also seemed likely. Other persistent national security problems, including tension with [[Iraq]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] area, [[Libya]] in [[North Africa]], and [[North Korea]] in [[East Asia]], could flare up again, as could the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].

In preparing future budgets, the challenge would be to find the right mix between money for operation and maintenance accounts on the one hand and modernization procurement funds on the other, while facing the prospect of a flat DoD budget of about $250 billion annually for the next decade or so. A relatively new problem that could affect the DoD budget was [[vertical integration]] in the defense industry. It occurred on a large scale in the 1990s as mergers of major defense contractors created a few huge dominant companies, particularly in the [[aerospace]] industry. They were called vertical because they incorporated most of the elements of the production process, including parts and subcomponents. Cohen and other Pentagon leaders began to worry that vertical integration could reduce competition and in the long run increase the costs of what the Department of Defense had to buy.

===Social issues===
In December 1999, Cohen ordered an immediate review of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration's]] controversial "[[don't ask, don't tell]]" policy regarding the [[Sexual orientation in the United States military|status and treatment of gays and lesbians in the U.S. military]]. The order was given shortly after the president said publicly that the policy was not working.<ref>{{cite news| title=Pentagon to review 'don't ask, don't tell' policy| author=<!--CNN staff; no by-line.-->| date=December 13, 1999| url=http://archives.cnn.com/1999/US/12/13/pentagon.gays/index.html| work=CNN| accessdate=November 15, 2019}}</ref> During his tenure as Defense Secretary, Cohen also had to address various other social issues, including: the role of [[women in combat]] as well as in other military jobs, [[racism]], and [[sexual harassment]].

==Recent years==
[[File:William Cohen and Janet Langhart 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Cohen and his wife, author [[Janet Langhart]], August 2006]]
After leaving the Pentagon in 2001, Cohen founded ''[[The Cohen Group]]'', a business consulting and lobbyist firm, with three Pentagon officials, Bob Tyrer, Jim Bodner, and H.K. Park. Cohen was presented with the [[Woodrow Wilson Awards|Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service]] by the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Woodrow Wilson Center]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] on March 7, 2002, in [[New York City]].

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the [[White House]] of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials.

Cohen has written several books, including mysteries, poetry, and (with [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]]) an analysis of the [[Iran-contra affair]]. He is a Chairman Emeritus of the [[US-Taiwan Business Council]]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran an article entitled "From Public Life to Private Business" about Cohen's abrupt transition to the business of Washington lobbying within "weeks of leaving office." (May 28, 2006). It discussed the affairs of the Cohen Group in greater detail and while alleging no specific impropriety, took a generally negative view of the former Senator and Secretary of Defense.

On August 21, 2006, Cohen's novel, ''Dragon Fire'', was released. The plot revolves around a secretary of defense who contends with a potential [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] threat from a foreign country. In December 2006 he released a memoir with his wife, author [[Janet Langhart]], entitled ''Love in Black and White'', a memoir about race, religion, and the love couple shares over similar life circumstances and backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news |date=August 18, 2006 |title=''William Cohen'' is quite the speedy author these days |work=Names and Faces.

I think that only a few people are really committed to this war against terrorism.{{nbsp}}... We ought to have a real call to national service to commit ourselves to some form of public service{{nbsp}}...to put us on a war footing mentality."
