The '''United Methodist Church''' ('''UMC''') is a worldwide [[mainline Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] based in the [[United States]], and a major part of [[Methodism]]. In the 19th century, its main predecessor, the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], was a leader in [[evangelicalism]]. The present denomination was founded in 1968 in [[Dallas, Texas]], by union of the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist Church]] and the [[Evangelical United Brethren Church]]. The UMC traces its roots back to the [[Christian revival|revival]] movement of [[John Wesley|John]] and [[Charles Wesley]] in England, as well as the [[Great Awakening]] in the United States.<ref name="UMCofWB" /><ref name="Methodist Central Hall Westminster—Methodism" /> As such, the church's theological orientation is decidedly [[Wesleyan]].<ref name="Longhenry-Wesleyanism" /> It embraces [[liturgical]], [[holiness movement|holiness]], and evangelical elements.<ref name="UMC-Evangelical" /><ref name="EPPC" /><ref name="Oden2016">{{cite book|last=Oden|first=Thomas C.|title=The Rebirth of African Orthodoxy|date=April 5, 2016|publisher=Abingdon Press|language=en|isbn=9781501819100|pages=21|quote=The growth of United Methodism abroad, especially in Africa, is already coming to exercise increasing influence in the American church. ...

The United Methodist Church has a [[Connexionalism|connectional polity]], a typical feature of a number of Methodist denominations. It is organized into conferences. The highest level is called the [[General Conference (Methodism)|General Conference]] and is the only organization which may speak officially for the UMC. The church is a member of the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[World Methodist Council]], and other religious associations.

With at least 12 million members as of 2014, the UMC is the [[List of Christian denominations by number of members|largest denomination]] within the wider Methodist movement of approximately 80 million people across the world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cracknell|first=Kenneth|title=An introduction to world Methodism|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York |url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/18490/frontmatter/9780521818490_frontmatter.pdf|author2=White, Susan J. }}</ref> In the United States, the UMC ranks as the largest mainline Protestant denomination, the second-[[Protestantism in the United States|largest Protestant church]] after the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], and the third-largest Christian denomination.

==History==
{{Main|History of Methodism in the United States}}

===Church origins===
[[File:GA Savannah HD Wesley statue01.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of John Wesley in [[Savannah, Georgia]], where he served as a missionary]]
The movement, which would become the United Methodist Church, began in the mid-18th century within the [[Church of England]]. A small group of students, including John Wesley, Charles Wesley and [[George Whitefield]], met at [[Oxford University]]. They focused on Bible study, methodical study of scripture and living a holy life. Other students mocked them, saying they were the "[[Holy Club]]" and "the Methodists", being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle. Eventually, the so-called Methodists started individual societies or classes for members of the Church of England who wanted to live a more religious life.

In 1735, John and Charles Wesley went to America, hoping to teach the gospel to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the colony of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]. Instead, John became vicar of the church in Savannah.  His preaching was legalistic and full of harsh rules, and the congregation rejected him. After two years in America, he returned to England dejected and confused.  While sailing on his original journey to America, he had been impressed with the faith of the German Moravians on board, and when he returned to England he spent time with Peter Böhler, a German Moravian who was passing through England and who believed that a person is saved solely through the grace of God and not by works. John had many conversations with Böhler about this topic. On May 25, 1738, after listening to a reading of Martin Luther's preface to Romans, John came to the understanding that his good works could not save him and he could rest in God's grace for salvation.  For the first time in his life, he felt peace and the assurance of salvation.  In less than two years, the "Holy Club" disbanded. John Wesley met with a group of clergy. He said "they appeared to be of one heart, as well as of one judgment, resolved to be Bible-Christians at all events; and, wherever they were, to preach with all their might plain, old, Bible Christianity." The ministers retained their membership in the Church of England. Though not always emphasized or appreciated in the Anglican churches of their day, their teaching emphasized salvation by God's grace, acquired through faith in Christ. Three teachings they saw as the foundation of Christian faith were:

# People are all by nature ''dead in sin'' and, consequently, ''children of wrath''.
# They are ''justified by faith alone''.
# Faith produces inward and outward ''holiness''.

These clergy quickly became popular, attracting large congregations. The nickname students had used against the Wesleys was revived; they and their followers became known as ''Methodists''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wesley |first=John |title=A Short History of Methodism |url=http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/Wesley/shorthistory.stm |via=gbgm-umc.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413175648/http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/Wesley/shorthistory.stm |archive-date=April 13, 2012 |access-date=May 1, 2009}}</ref>

===Predecessors===
[[File:Old Barratt's Chapel (Methodist), Route 113, Frederica vicinity (Kent County, Delaware).jpg|thumb|[[Barratt's Chapel]], built in 1780, is the oldest Methodist church in the United States built for that purpose. The church was a meeting place of [[Francis Asbury|Asbury]] and [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Coke]].]]

The English preacher [[Francis Asbury]] arrived in America in 1771. He became a "circuit rider", taking the gospel to the furthest reaches of the new frontier as he had done as a preacher in England .<ref>[http://www.brewinbooks.com/eliza_asbury?search=Hallam Hallam, David J.A. Eliza Asbury: her cottage and her son], Studley, England 2003</ref> The first official organization in the United States occurred in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], in 1784, with the formation of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] at the [[Christmas Conference (Methodism)|Christmas Conference]] with Francis Asbury and [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] as the leaders.<ref name="ARE—Methodists" /><ref name="Greensboro College—Methodists" />

[[File:The Ordination of Bishop Asbury.jpg|thumb|left|The [[ordination]] of Bishop [[Francis Asbury]] by Bishop [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] at the Christmas Conference establishing the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], 1784]]
Though John Wesley originally wanted the Methodists to stay within the Church of England, the [[American Revolution]] decisively separated the Methodists in the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonies]] from the life and sacraments of the Anglican Church. In 1784, after unsuccessful attempts to have the Church of England send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies, Wesley decisively appointed fellow priest Thomas Coke as superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society. Together with Coke, Wesley sent a revision of the [[Book of Common Prayer|Anglican prayer book]] and the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] which were received and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, officially establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church. The conference was held at the [[Lovely Lane Methodist Church]], considered the [[mother church]] of American Methodism.<ref>{{cite web |url={{MHT url|id=171}}|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=November 21, 2008|work=Lovely Lane Methodist Church, Baltimore City|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}</ref>

The new church grew rapidly in the young country as it employed [[Circuit rider (Religious)|circuit riders]], many of whom were [[layperson|laymen]], to travel the mostly rural nation by horseback to preach the [[Good news (Christianity)|Gospel]] and to establish churches until there was scarcely any village in the United States without a Methodist presence. With 4,000 circuit riders by 1844, the Methodist Episcopal Church rapidly became the largest Protestant denomination in the country.

[[St. George's United Methodist Church (Philadelphia)|St. George's United Methodist Church]], located at the corner of 4th and New Streets, in the Old City neighborhood of Philadelphia, is the oldest Methodist church in continuous use in the United States, beginning in 1769. The congregation was founded in 1767, meeting initially in a sail loft on Dock Street, and in 1769 it purchased the shell of a building which had been erected in 1763 by a German Reformed congregation. At this time, Methodists had not yet broken away from the Anglican Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church was not founded until 1784.

[[File:Nineteenth Century Methodist Hymnal in Barratt's Chapel Museum, Frederica, Delaware.jpg|thumb|right|19th-century Methodist hymnal, [[Barratt's Chapel]]]]
Richard Allen and Absalom Jones became the first African Americans ordained by the Methodist Church. They were licensed by St. George's Church in 1784. Three years later, protesting racial segregation in the worship services, Allen led most of the black members out of St. George's; eventually they founded the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church and the African Methodist Episcopal denomination. Absalom Jones became an Episcopal priest. In 1836, the church's basement was excavated to make room for a Sunday school. In the 1920s a court case saved the church from being demolished to make way for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. The case resulted in the bridge being relocated. Historic St Georges welcomes visitors and is home to archives and a museum on Methodism.

In the more than 220 years since 1784, Methodism in the United States, like many other Protestant denominations, has seen a number of divisions and mergers. In 1830, the [[Methodist Protestant Church]] split from the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] over the issue of laity having a voice and vote in the administration of the church, insisting that clergy should not be the only ones to have any determination in how the church was to be operated. In 1844, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church split into two conferences because of tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination.

The two general conferences, Methodist Episcopal Church (the northern section) and [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]] remained separate until 1939. That year, the northern and southern Methodist Episcopal Churches and the Methodist Protestant Church merged to create [[Methodist Church (USA)|The Methodist Church]]. The uniting conference took place at First Methodist Church (now First United Methodist Church) of [[Marion, Indiana]].

===1968 merger===
On April 23, 1968, the United Methodist Church was created when the [[Evangelical United Brethren Church]] (represented by Bishop Reuben H. Mueller) and The Methodist Church (represented by Bishop [[Lloyd Christ Wicke]]) joined hands at the constituting General Conference in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. With the words, "Lord of the Church, we are united in Thee, in Thy Church and now in The United Methodist Church"<ref>1968 General Conference ''Daily Christian Advocate''</ref> the new denomination was given birth by both churches which had distinguished histories and influential ministries in various parts of the world.

===2021 potential schism===
On January 3, 2020, the denomination's leadership released a proposal to split the church over what it described as "fundamental differences" [[Christianity and homosexuality|over homosexuality]], particularly [[same-sex marriage]] (see [[#Homosexuality|§ Homosexuality]] below).<ref name=":1"/><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-01-03|title=United Methodist leaders propose plan to split church over LGBTQ ordination, marriage|url=https://religionnews.com/2020/01/03/leaders-announce-plan-to-split-united-methodist-church-over-lgbtq-ordination-marriage/|access-date=2020-12-05|website=Religion News Service|language=en-US}}</ref> The proposal would need to be approved by the General Conference in order to take effect. The 2020 General Conference originally scheduled to be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was postponed due to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. The next General Conference is tentatively scheduled to be held in August 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-15|title=United Methodists would've met this week to consider a split.

==Beliefs==
{{Methodism}}
The United Methodist Church seeks to create disciples for [[Jesus|Christ]] through outreach, evangelism, and through seeking holiness, also called [[sanctification]], by the power of the Holy Spirit. The flame in the [[Cross and flame|church logo]] represents the work of the Holy Spirit in the world, and the two parts of the flame also represent the predecessor denominations, the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren, united at the base symbolizing the 1968 merger.

The United Methodist Church understands itself to be part of the [[Four Marks of the Church|holy catholic (or universal) church]] and it recognizes the historic [[ecumenical creed]]s,<ref name="UMC—Our Common Heritage as Christians" /> the [[Apostles' Creed]]<ref name="UMC—Apostle's Creed" /> and the [[Nicene Creed]];<ref name="UMC—Nicene Creed" /> which are used frequently in [[church service|services of worship]].<ref name="Colorado State University—Creedal Church" /> The Book of Discipline also recognizes the importance of the [[Chalcedonian Creed]] of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].<ref>''2008 Book of Discipline'' para. 101, page 42</ref> It upholds the concept of the "visible and invisible Church," meaning that all who are truly believers in every age belong to the holy [[Church invisible]], while the United Methodist Church is a branch of the [[Church visible]], to which all believers must be connected as it is the only institution wherein the Word of God is preached and the Sacraments are administered.

Some argue that the United Methodist Church can lay a claim on [[apostolic succession]], as understood in the traditional sense.<ref name="William Joseph Whalen - Membership" /> As a result of the American Revolution, John Wesley was compelled in 1784 to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preachers as presbyters, Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat. [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]], already an Anglican priest, assisted Wesley in this action. Coke was then "set apart" as a superintendent (bishop) by Wesley and dispatched with Vasey and Whatcoat to America to take charge of Methodist activities there. In defense of his action to ordain, Wesley himself cited an ancient opinion from the [[Church of Alexandria]], which held that [[bishop]]s and [[presbyter]]s constituted one [[Holy Orders|order]] and therefore, bishops are to be elected from and by the [[presbyterate]]. He knew that for two centuries the succession of bishops in the Church of Alexandria was preserved through ordination by presbyters alone and was considered valid by the ancient church. Methodists today who would argue for apostolic succession would do so on these grounds.<ref name="John McClintock, James Strong"/>

While many United Methodist congregations operate in the evangelical tradition, others reflect the [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] Protestant traditions. Although United Methodist practices and interpretation of beliefs have evolved over time, these practices and beliefs can be traced to the writings of the church's founders, especially [[John Wesley]] and [[Charles Wesley]] (Anglicans), but also [[Philip William Otterbein]] and [[Martin Boehm]] (United Brethren), and [[Jacob Albright]] (Evangelical Association). With the formation of the United Methodist Church in 1968, theologian [[Albert Outler|Albert C. Outler]] led the team which systematized denominational doctrine. Outler's work proved pivotal in the work of union, and he is largely considered the first United Methodist theologian.

===Doctrine===
The officially established Doctrinal Standards of United Methodism are:
* The [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] of the Methodist Church;<ref name="UMC—Doctrinal Standards" />
* The [[Confession of Faith (United Methodist)|Confessions of Faith]] of the Evangelical United Brethren Church;<ref name="UMC—Doctrinal Standards" />
* The ''General Rules'' of the Methodist Societies;<ref name="UMC—The General Rules of the Methodist Church" />
* The Standard Sermons of John Wesley;<ref name="UMC—Doctrinal Standards" />
* John Wesley's ''Explanatory Notes on the New Testament''.<ref name="UMC—Doctrinal Standards" />

These Doctrinal Standards are constitutionally protected and nearly impossible to change or remove.<ref name="UMC—Doctrinal Standards" /> Other doctrines of the United Methodist Church are found in the ''[[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]''.

===Summary of basic beliefs===
The basic beliefs of the United Methodist Church include:
* [[Trinity|Triune]] [[God]]. God is one God in three persons: [[Christian God|Father]], [[Jesus|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name="UMC—Article I—Of Faith in the Holy Trinity" />
* [[The Bible]]. The Bible is the inspired word of God. F. Belton Joyner argues that there is a deep division within Methodism today about what this means. Does it mean the Bible was inspired when written (and the text today is always true and without error), or is it inspired when actually read by a Christian (and therefore depends on the interaction with the reader.) In the first case, says Joyner, the Christian is concerned only with the precise wording of the original manuscript, without regard to historical setting. In the other case, the reader tries to read the biblical text in terms of all of the influences of modern thought, with little regard for the meaning offered in the ancient texts. In that Wesleyan tradition, United Methodists balance these two extremes, aware that the same Holy Spirit who inspired the Scriptures is alive and well to bring the written Word alive for the twenty-first century. (United Methodists) take seriously both the original inspiration and today's contemporary inspiration. "...In this way, the Bible itself becomes the balancing, clarifying, even correcting tool for understanding the Scripture. God’s gifts in the written Word are so rich that they can continue to give light and life as one digs again and again into the same Scriptures."<ref>{{cite book|author=F. Belton Joyner|title=Being United Methodist in the Bible Belt: A Theological Survival Guide for Youth, Parents, and Other Confused United Methodists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6JKNoEWa8-cC&pg=PA28|year=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|page=28|isbn=9780664231682 }}</ref><ref>The British Methodist Church in 2001 adopted a more complex seven-way choice of what the Bible means.

* [[Sin]]. While human beings were intended to bear the image of God, all humans are sinners for whom that image is distorted. Sin estranges people from God and corrupts human nature such that we cannot heal or save ourselves.<ref name="Discipline page 43" />
* [[Salvation]] through Jesus Christ. God's redeeming love is active to save sinners through Jesus' [[incarnate]] life and teachings, through his [[atoning]] death, his [[resurrection]], his sovereign presence through history, and his promised return.<ref name="Discipline page 43"/>
* [[Sanctification]]. The grace of sanctification draws one toward the gift of Christian perfection, which Wesley described as a heart "habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor" and as "having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/our-wesleyan-heritage |title=Our Wesleyan Heritage |website=The people of The United Methodist Church |publisher=United Methodist Church |access-date=2019-07-14}}<br />{{cite web |url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1813 |title=Distinctive Wesleyan Emphases (Page 2) |website=Archives.umc.org |date=November 6, 2006 |access-date=July 25, 2012}}</ref>
* [[Sacrament]]s. The UMC recognizes two sacraments: [[Holy Baptism]] and [[Holy Communion]]. Other rites such as [[Confirmation]], [[Ordination]], [[Christian views of marriage|Holy Matrimony]], [[Christian burial|Funerals]], and [[Anointing of the Sick]] are performed but not considered sacraments. In Holy Baptism, the Church believes that "Baptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of difference whereby Christians are distinguished from others that are not baptized; but it is also a sign of [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] or the [[Born again (Christianity)|new birth]].<ref name="UMC—Article XVII—Of Baptism" /> It believes that Baptism is a sacrament in which God initiates a covenant with individuals,<ref name="UMC—A United Methodist Understanding of Baptism" /> people become a part of the Church,<ref name="UMC—A United Methodist Understanding of Baptism" /> is not to be repeated,<ref name="UMC—A United Methodist Understanding of Baptism" /> and is a [[Means of Grace|means of grace]].<ref name="UMC—What does The United Methodist Church believe about baptism?" /> The United Methodist Church generally practices Baptism by sprinkling, pouring, or immersion<ref name="UMC: Glossary—Baptism" /> and recognizes [[Trinitarian formula]]<ref name="GLFUMC—Sunday Services" /> baptisms from other [[Christian denominations]].<ref name="UMC GBOD—By Water & The Spirit" /> The United Methodist Church affirms the [[real presence]] of Christ in Holy Communion, but does not hold to transubstantiation.<ref name="This Holy Mystery" /> The church believes that the bread is an effectual sign of His body [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|crucified]] on the [[Christian cross|cross]] and the [[grape juice|cup]] is an effectual sign of His blood shed for humanity.<ref name="Oremus Bible Browser—Institution of the Lord's Supper" /> Through the outward and visible signs of bread and wine, the inward and spiritual reality of the Body and Blood of Christ are offered to believers.  The church holds that the celebration of the Eucharist is an [[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]] of Jesus' death,<ref name="UMC—Communion: Overview" /> and believes the sacrament to be a [[Means of Grace|means of grace]],<ref name="The Means of Grace by John Wesley" /> and practices [[open communion]].<ref name="UMC—Our Christian Roots" />
* [[Free will]]. The UMC believes that people, while corrupted by [[sin]], are free to make their own choices because of God's [[divine grace]] enabling them, and that people are truly accountable before God for their choices.
* [[Social Justice]]. The church opposes evils such as slavery, inhumane prison conditions, capital punishment, economic injustice, child labor, racism, and inequality.<ref>http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1815</ref>

===Distinctive Wesleyan emphases===
The key emphasis of Wesley's theology relates to how [[divine grace]] operates within the individual. Wesley defined the Way of Salvation as the operation of grace in at least three parts: [[Prevenient Grace]], [[Justification (theology)|Justifying Grace]], and [[Sanctification|Sanctifying Grace]].

[[Prevenient grace]], or the grace that "goes before" us, is given to all people. It is that power which enables us to love and motivates us to seek a relationship with God through Jesus Christ.<ref name="UMC GBGM-Grace" /> This grace is the present work of God to turn us from our sin-corrupted human will to the loving will of the Father. In this work, God desires that we might sense both our sinfulness before God and God's offer of salvation. Prevenient grace allows those tainted by sin to nevertheless make a truly free choice to accept or reject God's [[Salvation#Arminianism|salvation]] in Christ.<ref name="UMC GBGM-Grace" />

[[Justification (theology)|Justifying Grace]] or Accepting Grace<ref name="UMC GBGM-Grace"/> is that grace, offered by God to all people, that we receive by faith and trust in Christ, through which God pardons the believer of [[sin]]. It is in justifying grace we are received by God, in spite of our sin. In this reception, we are forgiven through the atoning work of [[Jesus Christ]] on the cross. The justifying grace cancels our guilt and empowers us to resist the power of sin and to fully love God and neighbor. Today, justifying grace is also known as [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]], "accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior," or being "[[Born again Christianity|born again]]."<ref name="UMC GBGM-Grace"/><ref name="CUMC Accepting Christ" /> John Wesley originally called this experience the [[Born again (Christianity)|New Birth]].<ref name="UMC GBGM-The New Birth" /> This experience can occur in different ways; it can be one transforming moment, such as an [[altar call]] experience,<ref name="UMC-Altar Call" /> or it may involve a series of decisions across a period of time.<ref name="IMARC-Quote Two" />

[[Sanctification|Sanctifying Grace]] is that grace of God which sustains the believers in the journey toward [[Christian Perfection]]: a genuine love of God with heart, soul, mind, and strength, and a genuine love of our neighbors as ourselves. Sanctifying grace enables us to respond to God by leading a Spirit-filled and Christ-like life aimed toward love.  Wesley never claimed this state of perfection for himself but instead insisted the attainment of perfection was possible for all Christians. Here the English Reformer parted company with both Luther and Calvin, who denied that a man would ever reach a state in this life in which he could not fall into sin. Such a man can lose all inclination to evil and can gain perfection in this life.<ref name="William Joseph Whalen - Christian Perfection" />

[[Methodism|Wesleyan theology]] maintains that salvation is the act of God's grace entirely, from invitation, to pardon, to growth in [[Sacred|holiness]]. Furthermore, God's prevenient, justifying, and sanctifying grace interact dynamically in the lives of Christians from birth to death.

According to Wesleyan understanding, [[good works]] are the fruit of one's salvation, not the way in which that salvation was earned. Faith and good works go hand in hand in Methodist theology: a living tree naturally and inevitably bears fruit. Wesleyan theology rejects the doctrine of [[Perseverance of the saints|eternal security]], believing that [[Conditional preservation of the saints|salvation can be rejected]].<ref name="Weber/Kalberg-Conditional preservation of the saints">{{cite book |url = https://archive.org/details/pdfy-8fnkKz0SleumNaIz|page = [https://archive.org/details/pdfy-8fnkKz0SleumNaIz/page/n311 91]|quote = salvation can be lost methodist.| title = The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|year = 2001|publisher = Routledge|access-date =January 4, 2009}}</ref> Wesley emphasized that believers must continue to grow in their relationship with Christ, through the process of Sanctification.

A key outgrowth of this theology is the United Methodist dedication not only to the [[Evangelism|Evangelical Gospel]] of repentance and a personal relationship with God, but also to the [[Social Gospel]] and a commitment to social justice issues that have included abolition, women's suffrage, labor rights, civil rights, and ministry with the poor.

===Characterization of Wesleyan theology===
{{Main|Wesleyan theology}}
[[Methodist theology]] stands at a unique crossroads between [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[holiness movement|holiness]] and sacramental,<ref name="Winn"/> between liturgical and [[charismatic (movement)|charismatic]], and between [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] theology and practice. It has been characterized as [[Arminian]] theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit to bring holiness into the life of the participating believer. The United Methodist Church believes in ''[[prima scriptura]]'', seeing the [[Bible]] as the primary authority in the Church and using sacred [[Christian tradition|tradition]], [[reason]], and [[Born again Christianity|experience]] to interpret it, with the aid of the [[Holy Spirit]] (see [[Wesleyan Quadrilateral]]).<ref name="UMC—Wesleyan Quadrilateral" /> Therefore, according to ''The Book of Discipline,'' United Methodist theology is at once "catholic, evangelical, and reformed."<ref>2008 Book of Discipline, para. 102, p.59</ref> Today, the UMC is generally considered one of the more [[moderate]] and [[Toleration|tolerant]] denominations with respect to race, [[gender]], and [[ideology]], though the denomination itself includes a wide spectrum of attitudes. Comparatively, the UMC stands to the right of [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] and [[progressive Christianity|progressive]] Protestant groups such as the [[United Church of Christ]] and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] on certain issues (especially regarding sexuality), but to the left of historically conservative evangelical traditions such as the [[Southern Baptists]] and [[Pentecostalism]], in regard to theological matters such as [[social justice]] and Biblical interpretation. The UMC is made up of a broad diversity of thought, and so there are many clergy and laity within the UMC that hold differing viewpoints on such theological matters.

===Diversity within beliefs===
In making an appeal to a tolerance of diversity of theological opinion, John Wesley said, "Though we may not think alike, may we not all love alike?" The phrase "In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, charity" has also become a maxim among Methodists, who have always maintained a great diversity of opinion on many matters within the Church.

The United Methodist Church allows for a wide range of theological and political beliefs. For example, former [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-TX), former First Lady [[Laura Bush]] and former [[Attorney General of the United States]], [[Jeff Sessions]], are United Methodists, as are Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-MA), former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] (D-NY) and former Senator [[Max Cleland]] (D-GA).

The Pew Research Center's 2014 US Religious Landscape Study concluded that the political preferences of US adult members of the United Methodist Church was 54 percent Republican / lean Republican, 35 percent Democrat / lean Democrat, and 11 percent independent / no lean / other.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Political Preferences of U.S. Religious Groups |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/23/u-s-religious-groups-and-their-political-leanings//|website=pewforum.org|publisher=Pew Research|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref>

====Abortion====

The topic of abortion is complex for the United Methodist Church. The United Methodist Church affirms these two sentences in The Social Principles: Our belief in the sanctity of unborn human life makes us reluctant to approve abortion.  But we are equally bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well-being of the mother and the unborn child.

Nevertheless, the United Methodist Church holds that "while we understand the need for women to have access to safe, legal abortions, we also 'mourn and are committed to promoting the diminishment of high abortion rates'."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/the-united-methodist-church-and-the-complex-topic-of-abortion|title=The United Methodist Church and the complex topic of abortion – The United Methodist Church|last=Communications|first=United Methodist|website=The United Methodist Church|language=en|access-date=January 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202022804/http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/the-united-methodist-church-and-the-complex-topic-of-abortion|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and they "are equally bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well-being of the mother, for whom devastating damage may result from an unacceptable pregnancy. In continuity with past Christian teaching, we recognize tragic conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion, (in the eyes of God) and in such cases we support the legal option of abortion under proper medical procedures."<ref name="UMC – Abortion" /> The Church cautions that "Governmental laws and regulations do not provide all the guidance required by the informed Christian conscience."<ref name="UMC – Abortion" /> The Church emphasizes the need of a supportive ministry to women who have experienced abortions: "We further encourage local churches to make available contact information for counseling agencies that offer programs to address post-abortion stress for all seeking help."<ref name="UMC – Abortion" />

Members of the United Methodist Church who identify with the [[anti-abortion]] position come mostly from the Confessing Movement within the denomination and have organized into the [[Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality]] (TUMAS) to further their position within the denomination.<ref name="Thomas C. Oden" /> On the other side, the [[Methodist Federation for Social Action]] and [[United Methodist Women]] continue to represent [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] views.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mfsaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/Document9.pdf|title=Statement on Reproductive Rights|website=mfsaweb.org|publisher=Methodist Federation for Social Action|access-date=May 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011063050/http://mfsaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/Document9.pdf|archive-date=October 11, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.unitedmethodistwomen.org/news/stumbling-over-reproductive-health|title=Stumbling Over Reproductive Health|last=Sellu|first=Elmira|date=2012|website=unitedmethodistwomen.org|publisher=United Methodist Women|access-date=May 30, 2016}}</ref>

====Alcohol====
Historically, the Methodist Church has supported the [[temperance movement]].<ref name="Drew University—Temperance" /> [[John Wesley]] warned against the dangers of drinking in his famous sermon, "The Use of Money",<ref name="UMC GBGM- Sermon 50" /> and in his letter to an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]].<ref name="Wesley Heritage Foundation" /><ref name="UMC—Alcohol and Other Drugs2" /> Today the United Methodist Church states that it "affirms our long-standing support of abstinence from alcohol as a faithful witness to God's liberating and redeeming love for persons."<ref name="UMC—Alcohol and Other Drugs" /> In fact, the United Methodist Church uses unfermented [[grape juice]] in the sacrament of [[Holy Communion]], thus "expressing pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics, enabling the participation of children and youth, and supporting the church's witness of abstinence."<ref name="UMC—Grape Juice" /> Moreover, in 2011 and 2012, the United Methodist Church's [[General Board of Church and Society]] called on all United Methodists to abstain from alcohol for [[Lent]].<ref name="Alcohol—Lent1" /><ref name="Alcohol—Lent2" /><ref name="Alcohol—Lent3" />

====Capital punishment====
The United Methodist Church, along with some other [[Methodist]] churches, condemns [[capital punishment]], saying that it cannot accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life.<ref name="UMC—Capital Punishment" /> The Church also holds that the death penalty falls unfairly and unequally upon marginalized persons including the poor, the uneducated, ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with mental and emotional illnesses.<ref name="UMC—Official church statements on capital punishment" /> The United Methodist Church also believes that Jesus explicitly repudiated the ''[[lex talionis]]'' in [[Matthew 5:38]]–[[Matthew 5:39|39]] and abolished the death penalty in [[John 8]]:7.<ref name="UMC—Capital Punishment" /> The [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]] of the United Methodist Church calls for its bishops to uphold opposition to capital punishment and for governments to enact an immediate moratorium on carrying out the death penalty sentence.

====Creation====
The United Methodist Church, like many mainline Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church, has determined that there is no conflict between faith and the theory of evolution. Some clergy have stated that "it's time for people of faith to accept evolution."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.umc.org/news-and-media/its-time-for-people-of-faith-to-accept-evolution |title=It's time for people of faith to accept evolution |work=UM News |publisher=The United Methodist Church |access-date=May 2, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416163549/http://www.umc.org/news-and-media/its-time-for-people-of-faith-to-accept-evolution |archive-date=April 16, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Additionally, the UMC officially affirms the theory of evolution and "opposes introducing theories such as Creationism or Intelligent Design into public school curriculum."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/what-is-the-united-methodist-churchs-position-on-evolution|title=What is The United Methodist Church's position on evolution? – The United Methodist Church|last=Communications|first=United Methodist|website=The United Methodist Church|access-date=May 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513181222/http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/what-is-the-united-methodist-churchs-position-on-evolution|archive-date=May 13, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2016, the denomination denied approval for a creationist group to be officially represented at the church's General Conference.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/united-methodist-church-bans-intelligent-design-group-general-conference-creation-evolution-155368/ |title=United Methodist Church Bans Intelligent Design Group From General Conference|website=Christian Post|access-date=May 2, 2016}}</ref>

====Euthanasia====
The United Methodist Church is opposed to euthanasia and assisted suicide. The official stance mentions that "The church has an obligation to see that all persons have access to needed pastoral and medical care and therapy in those circumstances that lead to loss of self-worth, suicidal despair, and/or the desire to seek physician-assisted suicide." It also states that "If death is deliberately sought as the means to relieve suffering, that must be understood as direct and intentional taking of life&nbsp;... The United Methodist tradition opposes the taking of life as an offense against God's sole dominion over life, and an abandonment of hope and humility before God."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/what-is-the-united-methodist-stance-on-assisted-suicide |title=What is the United Methodist stance on assisted suicide?, United Methodist Church Official Website |access-date=June 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525171303/http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/what-is-the-united-methodist-stance-on-assisted-suicide |archive-date=May 25, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The United Methodist Church, represented by Bishop Scott Jones, of the Texas Annual Conference, on behalf of the Houston Methodist Research Institute, and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], represented by Archbishop [[Vincenzo Paglia]], of the [[Pontifical Academy for Life]], signed a "Joint Declaration on the End of Life and Palliative Care", on 17 September 2018, reaffirming the common stance of both denominations in opposing euthanasia.<ref>[https://juicyecumenism.com/2018/11/07/methodists-catholics-unite-euthanasia/ Methodists and Catholics Unite against Euthanasia, Juicy Ecumenism, 7 November 2018]</ref>

====Gambling====
The United Methodist Church opposes [[gambling]], believing that it is a [[sin]] which feeds on human [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]] and which invites people to place their trust in possessions, rather than in God, whom Christians should "love ... with all your heart."{{Bibleref2c|Mark|12:29–30}}<ref name="UMC—Gambling" /> It quotes the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] who states:{{quote|But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains.|{{Bibleref2|1Tim|6:9-10a|NRSV|1 Tim. 6:9-10a}}}} The United Methodist Church therefore holds that:
* Gambling is a menace to society, deadly to the best interests of moral, social, economic, and spiritual life, and destructive of good government. As an act of faith and concern, Christians should abstain from gambling and should strive to minister to those victimized by the practice.<ref name="UMC—Gambling" />
* Where [[problem gambling|gambling has become addictive]], the Church will encourage such individuals to receive therapeutic assistance so that the individual's energies may be redirected into positive and constructive ends.<ref name="UMC—Gambling" />
* The Church should promote standards and personal lifestyles that would make unnecessary and undesirable the resort to commercial gambling—including public lotteries—as a recreation, as an escape, or as a means of producing public revenue or funds for support of charities or government.<ref name="UMC—Gambling" />

====Gun control====
The United Methodist Church supports federal legislative efforts for strict [[gun control]] measures in the United States, and outright bans of most weapons in other nations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/gun-violence |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821071141/http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/gun-violence |archive-date=August 21, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
The Church also declares every church to be "a weapon-free zone."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/church-is-a-weapon-free-zone |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831072406/http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/church-is-a-weapon-free-zone |archive-date=August 31, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On January 3, 2020, some denominational leaders along with various advocacy groups submitted a plan called, “Protocol of Reconciliation and Grace through Separation,” to [[Schism#Christianity|split the church]] over what it described as "fundamental differences" over issues pertaining to [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], particularly [[same-sex marriage]]. The  “Protocol of Reconciliation and Grace through Separation” plan would create a new traditionalist [[List_of_Methodist_denominations#North_America|Methodist denomination]], with the existing church moving to more acceptance of non-heterosexual and gender-nonconforming identities.

====Military service====
According to ''The Book of Resolutions of The United Methodist Church'', "The United Methodist Church calls upon all who choose to [[Military service|take up arms]] or who order others to do so to evaluate their actions in accordance with historic church teaching limiting resort to war, including questions of proportionality, legal authority, discrimination between combatants and noncombatants, just cause, and probability of success...."<ref name="UMC—Just War" />

The United Methodist Church opposes [[conscription]] as incompatible with the teaching of Scripture.<ref name="UMC—Military Service" /> Therefore, the Church supports and extends its ministry to those [[Christian pacifism|persons]] who [[Conscientious objection|conscientiously oppose]] all war, or any particular war, and who therefore refuse to serve in the armed forces or to cooperate with systems of military conscription. However, the United Methodist Church also supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously choose to serve in the armed forces or to accept alternative service. The church also states that "as Christians they are aware that neither the way of military action, nor the way of inaction is always righteous before God."<ref name="UMC—Military Service" />

The United Methodist Church maintains that [[war]] is incompatible with [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s message and teachings. Therefore, the Church rejects war as an instrument of national foreign policy, to be employed only as a last resort in the prevention of such evils as [[genocide]], brutal suppression of human rights, and unprovoked international aggression.<ref name="UMC—War and Peace" /> It insists that the first moral duty of all nations is to resolve by peaceful means every dispute that arises between or among them; that human values must outweigh military claims as governments determine their priorities; that the militarization of society must be challenged and stopped; that the manufacture, sale, and deployment of armaments must be reduced and controlled; and that the production, possession, or use of nuclear weapons be condemned. Consequently, the United Methodist Church endorses general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.<ref name="UMC—War and Peace" />

====Pornography====
The United Methodist Church teaches that [[pornography]] is "about violence, degradation, exploitation, and coercion" and "deplore[s] all forms of commercialization, abuse, and exploitation of sex."<ref name="UMC—Book of Resolutions" /> The ''Sexual Ethics Task Force of The United Methodist Church'' states that "Research shows it [pornography] is not an 'innocent activity.' It is harmful and is generally addictive. Persons who are addicted to pornography are physiologically altered, as is [[Social effects of pornography|their perspective]], relationships with parishioners and family, and their perceptions of girls and women."<ref name="UMC—Pornography" />

====Stem cell research====
The UMC supports federal funding for research on embryos created for [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] that remain after the procreative efforts have ceased, if the embryos were provided for research instead of being destroyed, were not obtained by sale, and those donating had given prior informed consent for the research purposes.<ref name="UMC—Stem Cell Research"/> The UMC stands in "opposition to the creation of embryos for the sake of research" as "a human [[embryo]], even at its earliest stages, commands our reverence."<ref name="UMC—Stem Cell Research" /> It supports research on stem cells retrieved from umbilical cords and [[adult stem cells]], stating that there are "few moral questions" raised by [[Stem cell controversy|this issue]].<ref name="UMC—Stem Cell Research"/>

==Worship and liturgy==
[[File:Advent Wreath (Broadway United Methodist Church).jpg|thumb|upright|right|An [[Advent wreath]] in the [[chancel]] of Broadway United Methodist Church, located in [[New Philadelphia, Ohio]]]]
The United Methodist Church includes a variety of approaches to public worship.  The common pattern of worship is found in the official liturgies of the church, while the practices of congregations across the denomination are quite diverse.

The common pattern comes from John Wesley, who wrote that "there is no Liturgy in the world, either in ancient or modern language, which breathes more of a solid, scriptural, rational piety, than the Common Prayer of the Church of England."<ref>Works of John Wesley, vol. XVI, page 304</ref> When the Methodists in America were separated from the [[Church of England]], John Wesley himself provided a revised version of The [[Book of Common Prayer]] called ''[[The Sunday Service of the Methodists; With Other Occasional Services]]''. Wesley's ''Sunday Service'' has shaped the official liturgies of the Methodists ever since.

Like other historic Christian churches,{{dubious|date=August 2018}} the United Methodist Church has official [[liturgy|liturgies]] for services of [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]], [[baptism]], [[wedding]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[ordination]], [[anointing of the Sick|anointing of the sick]] and [[canonical hours|daily office]] prayer services. Some clergy offer [[faith healing|healing services]], while [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcism]] is an occasional practice by some clergy in The United Methodist Church in Africa.<ref name="Karen B. Westerfield Tucker - Healing Service" /><ref name="Andy Langford - Healing Service" /><ref name="Robert Famighetti - Exorcism" /><ref name="Ranger" /> These services involve the [[laying on of hands]] and anointing with [[Holy anointing oil|oil]].<ref name="Karen B. Westerfield Tucker - Anointing and Laying" /> Along with these, there are also special services for [[Liturgical year|holy days]] such as [[All Saints' Day|All Saints Day]], [[Ash Wednesday]], [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], and [[Easter Vigil]]. These services are contained in ''The [[United Methodist Hymnal]]'' and ''[[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)]]''.<ref>2008 ''Book of Discipline'' paragraph 1114.3</ref> Many of these liturgies are derived from the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition's [[Book of Common Prayer]]. In most cases, congregations also use other elements of liturgical worship, such as candles, [[vestment]]s, paraments, banners, and liturgical art.

Typical worship services in United Methodism will include:
* Singing. Since the days of [[Charles Wesley]], the hymn-writer and early Methodist leader, lively singing has been, and remains, an important aspect of United Methodist worship. The church publishes an official hymnal, ''[[The United Methodist Hymnal]]'', for use in churches, and allows for music ranging from hymns to [[contemporary worship music]] to be played as part of the service.
* A Biblical Message. Listening to the reading of Scripture and a sermon based upon the Biblical text is virtually always included in United Methodist worship. Many United Methodist churches follow the [[Revised Common Lectionary]] for their Sunday Bible readings.
* Prayer. Many churches include a time of response or a prayer time in which people may share concerns or pray with ministers. This time of response may include celebrations of [[baptism]], [[confirmation]], or profession of faith.<ref>''The United Methodist Hymnal'' page 7</ref>
* Holy Communion. Some congregations celebrate communion on the first Sunday of the month and a few celebrate it only quarterly. A growing number of congregations celebrate the [[sacrament]] of [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] on a weekly basis, as [[John Wesley]] himself encouraged his followers to practice.<ref>in his sermon "The Duty of Constant Communion" online at http://wesley.nnu.edu/john_wesley/sermons/101.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727021645/http://wesley.nnu.edu/john_wesley/sermons/101.htm |date=July 27, 2009 }} Retrieved January 21, 2009</ref> In adopting the statement on Holy Communion entitled ''This Holy Mystery'' in 2004, the General Conference of the Church urged congregations to move toward weekly celebration of communion and to use the official liturgies of the church when doing so.<ref>[http://archives.umc.org/frames.asp?url=http%3A//gbod.org/worship/thisholymystery/default.html "This Holy Mystery"]. Retrieved January 21, 2009</ref>
* [[Lovefeast]]. Many congregations celebrate the Lovefeast (also known as the Agape Feast) on a quarterly basis, which is accompanied by the partaking of bread and water, as well as the sharing of [[Testimony#Religion|testimonies]], Scripture readings and hymn singing.<ref name="Discipleship2016">{{cite book|title=Guidelines Small Group Ministries|date=15 November 2016|publisher=General Board Of Discipleship of The United Methodist Church|language=en|isbn=9781501829918|page=31}}</ref>
* Giving. Almost every service has an opportunity for those gathered to give of their "[[Tithe#Methodist Churches|tithes and offerings]]" to support the ministry of that particular congregation. Through apportionments, a portion of those gifts go to Christian ministries that have a national or global impact.

Many larger United Methodist congregations have incorporated more contemporary styles of music and audio-visual technology into some of their worship services, though these churches generally also offer more traditional services.

As John Wesley advocated outdoor [[evangelism]], [[revival meeting|revival services]] are a traditional worship practice of Methodism that are often held in United Methodist churches, as well as at outdoor [[camp meeting]]s and at [[tent revival]]s.<ref name="Winn"/><ref name="Dresser2015">{{cite book|last=Dresser|first=Thomas|title=Martha's Vineyard: A History|date=4 May 2015|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|language=en|isbn=9781625849045|page=57}}</ref><ref name="ChilcoteWarner2008">{{cite book|last1=Chilcote|first1=Paul W.|last2=Warner|first2=Laceye C.|title=The Study of Evangelism: Exploring a Missional Practice of the Church|date=13 February 2008|publisher=Wm.

The [[chancel]] of United Methodist churches usually features a [[lectern]] and [[baptismal font]] on one side of the [[altar table]] and a [[pulpit]] on the other side.<ref name="Chancel" />  The chancel also features the [[Christian Flag]] and sometimes, a [[processional cross]].<ref name="Flag" /><ref name="ChristianFlag" /> The chancel is often delimited by [[altar rail|chancel rails]], sometimes with a [[Mourners' bench|mourner's bench]] in front of it.<ref name="Miller2011">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Bonita|title=Little Clifty United Methodist Church: Its History Through Its People|date=9 June 2011|publisher=Little Clifty United Methodist Church|language=en|isbn=9781456867812|pages=36–}}</ref>

===Saints===
{{Main|Saints in Methodism}}

The United Methodist Church's understanding of a "saint" is not unique among Protestants, yet differs significantly from the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran views. Methodists do not have a process for electing people to sainthood. They do not pray to saints, nor do they believe that saints serve as mediators to God.  The denomination considers all faithful Christians to be saints.

Methodist institutions may be named after a biblical figure (e.g., "St. James UMC"). Methodists also honor notable heroes and heroines of the Christian faith and look to these prominent saints as providing examples of holy living and commitment to Christ that are worthy of imitation (see {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|11:1}}).  Such exemplary saints include [[martyr]]s, [[Confessor of the Faith|confessors of the Faith]], [[Evangelism|evangelists]], or important [[bible|biblical]] figures such as [[Saint Matthew]]. Lutheran theologian and martyr to the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] Founder [[William Booth]], African missionary [[David Livingstone]] and Methodism's revered founder [[John Wesley]] are among many cited as Protestant saints.<ref name="Saints" />

Article XIV of ''The United Methodist Articles of Religion'' explicitly rejects "invocation of saints" (praying to saints). The text reads "—Of Purgatory—The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshiping, and adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the Word of God."<ref>''The United Methodist Book of Discipline'', 2008.</ref>

==Organization==
[[File:Hartzell Memorial United Methodist Church.jpg|thumb|right|Hartzell Memorial United Methodist church in [[Chicago]], United States]]

===Governance===
The church is decentralized with the [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]] being the official governing body. However, administratively the church has a [[ecclesiastical polity|governing structure]] that is similar to that of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]:
* [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]]—The [[legislative branch]] that makes all decisions as to doctrine and polity.
* [[United Methodist Council of Bishops|Council of Bishops]]—When taken into consideration along with the various general agencies of the church, takes on a role similar to an [[executive branch]]. The Council of Bishops consists of all active and retired bishops and meets twice a year. According to the Book of Discipline 2000, "The Church expects the Council of Bishops to speak to the Church and from the Church to the world, and to give leadership in the quest for Christian unity and interreligious relationships."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=258&GID=62&GMOD=VWD&GCAT=C |title=Council of Bishops—umc.or—Retrieved February 3, 2008 |publisher=Archives.umc.org |date=November 6, 2006 |access-date=July 25, 2012}}</ref> The council is presided over by a President who serves a two-year term. The President has no official authority beyond presiding.

===General Conference===
The United Methodist Church is organized into conferences. The highest level is called the ''[[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]]'' and is the only organization which may speak officially for the church. The General Conference meets every four years ([[quadrennium]]). Legislative changes are recorded in ''[[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|The Book of Discipline]]'' which is revised after each General Conference. Non-legislative resolutions are recorded in the ''Book of Resolutions'', which is published after each General Conference, and expire after eight years unless passed again by a subsequent session of General Conference. The last General Conference was held in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=2041977&ct=7671527 |title=Portland to Host 2016 United Methodist General Conference |website=The people of The United Methodist Church |publisher=United Methodist Church |access-date=January 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105004411/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=2041977&ct=7671527 |archive-date=January 5, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The event is currently rotated between the US jurisdictions of the church. Bishops, councils, committees, boards, elders, etc., are not permitted to speak on behalf of the United Methodist Church as this authority is reserved solely for the General Conference in accordance with the ''Book of Discipline''.

The [[plenary session]] is presided over by an active bishop who has been selected by a committee of delegates to the conference. It is not uncommon for different bishops to preside on different days.

The United Methodist church planned for a conference outside of the United States for the first time in history in 2024. These plans were established in 2015 for the first meeting. However, these plans were cancelled. The reason for why the conference was called off was because organizers not being able to find a convention space that would be available for two weeks to host the global gathering. Sara Hotchkiss, business manager for the Commission on General Conference stated:<blockquote>“No one has done anything wrong, or there’s no reason not to go. It’s just simply when we did a bid process, the facilities needed for the length of our conference were not available,” <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://religionnews.com/2019/08/13/united-methodist-church-scraps-plans-to-host-general-conference-in-the-philippines/|title=United Methodist Church scraps plans to host General Conference in the Philippines}}</ref></blockquote>

===Jurisdictional and central conferences===
Subordinate to the General Conference are the [[Conferences of the United Methodist Church|jurisdictional and central conferences]] which also meet every four years. The United States is divided into five jurisdictions: Northeastern, Southeastern, North Central, South Central and Western. Outside the United States the church is divided into seven central conferences: Africa, Congo, West Africa, Central & Southern Europe, Germany, Northern Europe and the Philippines. The main purpose of the jurisdictions and central conferences is to elect and appoint bishops, the chief administrators of the church. Bishops thus elected serve ''[[Episcopal area (United Methodist Church)|episcopal area]]s'', which consist of one or more ''[[annual conference]]s''.

Decisions in-between the four-year meetings are made by the Mission Council (usually consisting of church bishops). One of the most high-profile decisions in recent years by one of the councils was a decision by the Mission Council of the South Central Jurisdiction which in March 2007 approved a 99-year lease of {{convert|36|acre|m2}} at [[Southern Methodist University]] for the [[George W. Bush Presidential Library]]. The decision generated controversy in light of Bush's support of the [[Iraq War]] which the church bishops have criticized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umc.org/who-we-are/council-of-bishops |title=Council of Bishops |website=The people of The United Methodist Church |publisher=United Methodist Church |access-date=2019-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190714233020/http://www.umc.org/who-we-are/council-of-bishops |archive-date=July 14, 2019 |url-status=dead }}<br />{{cite web |url=http://bishops.umc.org/umns/intlnews_archive.asp?ptid=2&story=%7B9A8E4E8C-A22C-48CA-9C3E-BEEE4E42D4A4%7D&mid=881 |title=Bishop criticizes press, White House on Iraq |publisher=Bishops.umc.org |date=February 8, 2008 |access-date=July 25, 2012 }}</ref> A debate over whether the decision should or could be submitted for approval by the Southern Jurisdictional Conference at its July 2008 meeting in [[Dallas, Texas]], remains unresolved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wfn.org/2008/02/msg00005.html |title=Bush library opponents question process for approval |author=J.

===Judicial Council===
The Judicial Council is the highest court in the denomination. It consists of nine members, both laity and clergy, elected by the General Conference for an eight-year term. The ratio of laity to clergy alternates every eight years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/who-we-are/about-the-judicial-council|title=About the Judicial Council|last=Communications|first=United Methodist|website=The United Methodist Church|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925230741/http://www.umc.org/who-we-are/about-the-judicial-council|archive-date=September 25, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Judicial Council interprets the ''Book of Discipline'' between sessions of General Conference, and during General Conference, the Judicial Council rules on the constitutionality of laws passed by General Conference. The Council also determines whether actions of local churches, annual conferences, church agencies, and bishops are in accordance with church law. The Council reviews all decisions of law made by bishops<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&mid=4217 |title=Rules of Practice and Procedure |publisher=Archives.umc.org |date=November 6, 2006 |access-date=July 25, 2012}}</ref> The Judicial Council cannot create any legislation; it can only interpret existing legislation. The Council meets twice a year at various locations throughout the world. The Judicial Council also hears appeals from those who have been accused of chargeable offenses that can result in defrocking or revocation of membership.

===Annual Conference===
The ''[[Annual Conference]]'', roughly the equivalent of a [[diocese]] in the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] or a [[synod#Lutheran|synod]] in some [[Lutheran]] denominations such as the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], is the basic unit of organization within the UMC. The term ''Annual Conference'' is often used to refer to the geographical area it covers as well as the frequency of meeting. [[Clergy]] are members of their Annual Conference rather than of any local [[wikt:congregation|congregation]], and are appointed to a local church or other charge annually by the conference's resident [[Bishop (United Methodist)|Bishop]] at the meeting of the Annual Conference. In many ways, the United Methodist Church operates in a connectional organization of the Annual Conferences, and actions taken by one conference are not binding upon another.

===Districts===
Annual conferences are further divided into ''Districts'', each served by a ''[[District Superintendent (United Methodist Church)|District Superintendent]]''. The district superintendents are also appointed annually from the [[ordained]] [[Elder (Methodism)|elders]] of the Annual Conference by the [[bishop]]. District superintendents, upon completion of their service as superintendent, routinely return to serving local congregations. The Annual Conference cabinet is composed of the [[Bishop (United Methodist)|bishop]] and the district superintendents.

===Local churches===
{{main|List of local Methodist churches}}
''The Book of Discipline'' is the guidebook for local churches and pastors and describes in considerable detail the organizational structure of local United Methodist churches. All UM churches must have a board of trustees with at least three members and no more than nine members and it is recommended that no gender should hold more than a 2/3 majority. All churches must also have a nominations committee, a finance committee and a church council or administrative council. Other committees are suggested but not required such as a missions committee, or evangelism or worship committee. Term limits are set for some committees but not for all. The church conference is an annual meeting of all the officers of the church and any interested members. This committee has the exclusive power to set pastors' salaries (compensation packages for tax purposes) and to elect officers to the committees.

===Administrative offices===
[[File:Interchurch-center.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Interchurch Center]] in New York City, headquarters of the GBGM, GCCUIC and UMCOR]]
There is no official headquarters of the UMC although many of its biggest administrative offices are in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and are physically located near [[Vanderbilt University]] (which has historic Methodist ties but is no longer associated with the church).

While the [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]] is the only organization that can officially speak for The United Methodist Church as a whole, there are 13 agencies, boards and commissions of the general church. These organizations address specific topic areas of denomination-wide concern with administrative offices throughout the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umc.org/who-we-are/agencies |title=Agencies – United Methodist Church |publisher=The United Methodist Church |access-date=January 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106194516/http://www.umc.org/who-we-are/agencies |archive-date=January 6, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Education==
[[File:Hendrickschapelsu.jpg|thumb|Hendrick's Chapel at [[Syracuse University]], New York. The university maintains a relationship with the UMC.]]
Throughout its history, the United Methodist Church has placed great emphasis on the importance of education. As such, the United Methodist Church established and is affiliated with around one hundred [[colleges]] and [[universities]] in the United States, including [[American University]], [[Syracuse University]], [[Boston University]], [[Emory University]], [[Duke University]], [[Drew University]], [[University of Denver]], [[University of Evansville]], and [[Southern Methodist University]].<ref name="William Joseph Whalen - Hospitals & Universities" /> Most are members of the [[International Association of Methodist-related Schools, Colleges, and Universities]]. The church operates three hundred sixty schools and institutions overseas.

{{further|United Methodist Seminaries}}

==Clergy==
United Methodist clergy consist of elders, local pastors, associate members and deacons. They hold membership in the annual conference and not in the local church. Additionally provisional clergy hold membership in the annual conference while they are under appointment to a local church or extension ministry. There are several offices of ministry within the United Methodist Church.

Certified lay ministers may also be appointed to serve a church but under the supervision and direction of an elder.

===History===
The first Methodist clergy were ordained by John Wesley, a priest of the Church of England, because of the crisis caused by the [[American Revolution]] which isolated the Methodists in the States from the Church of England and its [[sacraments]]. Today, the clergy includes men and women who are [[ordained]] by [[bishop]]s as [[Elder (Methodism)|elders]] and [[Deacon#Methodism / Wesleyanism|deacons]] and are appointed to various ministries. Elders in the United Methodist Church itenerate and are subject to the authority and appointment of their bishops. They generally serve as pastors in local congregations. Deacons are in ''service'' ministry and may serve as musicians, liturgists, educators, business administrators, and a number of other areas. Elders and deacons are required to obtain a master's degree (generally an [[M.Div.]]), or another equivalent degree, before ''commissioning'' and then ultimately [[ordination]]. Elders in full connection are each a member of their Annual Conference Order of Elders. Likewise each deacon in full connection is a member of their Annual Conference Order of Deacons.<ref>The United Methodist Book of Discipline, 2008</ref>

===Ordination of women===
{{main|Ordination of women in Methodism}}
The Methodist Church has allowed [[ordination of women]] with full rights of clergy since 1956, when [[Maud K. Jensen]] was ordained and admitted into full connection in the Central Pennsylvania Annual Conference.<ref name="Maud Jensen, 1904-1998" /> This action was based upon its understanding of biblical principles.{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}}<ref name="UMC—Ordination of Women" />  The United Methodist Church, along with some other Protestant churches, holds that when the historical contexts involved are understood, a coherent Biblical argument can be made in favor of women's ordination.<ref name="Women's Service in the Church" />

===Bishop===
{{further|Bishop (United Methodist)}}
All [[clergy]] appointments are made and fixed annually by the resident [[Bishop (United Methodist)|bishop]] on the advice of the Annual Conference Cabinet, which is composed of the Area Provost/Dean (if one is appointed) and the several [[District Superintendent (United Methodist Church)|district superintendents]] of the districts of the Annual Conference. Until the bishop has read the appointments at the session of the Annual Conference, no appointments are officially fixed. Many Annual Conferences try to avoid making appointment changes between sessions of Annual Conference. While an appointment is made one year at a time, it is most common for an appointment to be continued for multiple years.  Appointment tenures in extension ministries, such as military chaplaincy, [[College religious organizations|campus ministry]], [[Mission (Christian)|missions]], higher education and other ministries beyond the local church are often even longer.

===Elder===
{{Further|Elder (United Methodist)}}
Elders are called by God, affirmed by the church, and ordained by a bishop to a ministry of Word, Sacrament, Order and Service within the church. They may be appointed to the local church, or to other valid extension ministries of the church. Elders are given the authority to preach the Word of God, administer the sacraments of the church, to provide care and counseling, and to order the life of the church for ministry and mission. Elders may also be appointed to extension ministry to serve as district superintendents, and they are eligible for election to the episcopacy. Elders serve a term of 2–3 years as provisional elders prior to their ordination.

===Deacon===
Deacons are called by God, affirmed by the church, and ordained by a bishop to servant leadership within the church.They are ordained to ministries of word, service, compassion, and justice.  They may be appointed to ministry within the local church or to an extension ministry that supports the mission of the church. Deacons give leadership, preach the Word, contribute in worship, conduct marriages, bury the dead, and aid the church in embodying its mission within the world. Deacons assist elders in the sacraments of Holy Communion and Baptism, and may be granted sacramental authority if they are appointed as the pastor in a local church or as their extension ministry requires, upon approval of the bishop. Deacons serve a term of 2–3 years as provisional deacons prior to their ordination.

===Provisional clergy===
At the 1996, General Conference the ordination order of transitional deacon was abolished. This created new orders known as "provisional elder" or "provisional deacon" for those who seek to be ordained in the respective orders. The provisional elder/deacon is a seminary graduate who serves at least two years in full-time appointments after being commissioned. During this period, the provisional elder may be granted sacramental ministry in their local appointment. For the first time in its history non-ordained pastors became a normal expectation, rather than an extraordinary provision for ministry.

===Local pastors===
Local Pastors are called by God, affirmed by the church, and appointed by a bishop to a ministry of Word, Sacrament, Order and Service within the church. The Local Pastors are given the authority to preach the Word of God, administer the sacraments of the church, to provide care and counseling, and to order the life of the church for ministry and mission, but are not ordained. When elders are not available to be appointed to a local church, either through shortage of personnel or financial hardship of a pastoral charge, the bishop may appoint a "local pastor" to serve the pastoral appointment. Local Pastors are often bi-vocational, living out their ministerial call in the local church and in their field of employment. Full-time and part-time licensed local pastors under appointment are clergy and hold membership in the annual conference and not in the local church. A local pastor's official title is [[License to Preach (Methodist)|'Licensed Local Pastor']] and is appointed as clergy to the local church where they preach, conduct divine worship and perform the regular duties of a pastor.<ref>The United Methodist Book of Discipline, 2008, ¶¶ 602, 315.</ref> The licensed local pastor has the authority of a pastor only within the context and during the time of the appointment and shall not extend beyond it.<ref name="UMC-Local Pastor" /> Local pastors are not required to have advanced degrees but are required to attend licensing school and continue education by attending an approved course of study at an approved United Methodist seminary or course of study school, or enroll in M.Div studies at an approved United Methodist Seminary, To continue towards Associate Membership in the Annual Conference, they must successfully complete written and oral examinations, and appear before the District Committee on Ministry and the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry, as well as meet certain age and service requirements. They also may continue towards ordination if they complete their bachelor's degree, requirements of their particular Conference Board of Ordained Ministry, as well as an advanced course or study or prescribed seminary courses at an approved seminary.  Upon retirement, or when no longer appointed to a local church, local pastors return to a charge conference as lay members.

==Laity==
There are two classes of lay membership in the UMC: ''Baptized Members'' and ''Professing Members''.

The United Methodist Church (UMC) practices infant and adult baptism. Baptized Members are those who have been [[infant baptism|baptized]] as an infant or child, but who have not subsequently professed their own faith. These ''Baptized Members'' become ''Professing Members'' through [[confirmation]] and sometimes the [[Profession (religious)|profession of faith]]. Individuals who were not previously baptized are [[Believer's baptism|baptized]] as part of their profession of faith and thus become ''Professing Members'' in this manner. Individuals may also become a ''Professing Member'' through transfer from another Christian denomination.<ref>The United Methodist Book of Discipline, 2004 para. 225.</ref>

Unlike [[confirmation]] and [[Profession (religious)|profession of faith]], [[Baptism]] is a sacrament in the UMC. The ''[[Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]'' directs the [[local church]] to offer membership preparation or confirmation classes to all people, including adults.<ref>The United Methodist Book of Discipline, 2004 para. 216a&b.</ref> The term [[confirmation]] is generally reserved for youth, while some variation on ''membership class'' is generally used for adults wishing to join the church. The ''Book of Discipline'' normally allows any youth at least completing sixth grade to participate, although the pastor has discretionary authority to allow a younger person to participate. In confirmation and membership preparation classes, students learn about Church and the Methodist-Christian theological tradition in order to profess their ultimate faith in Christ.

Lay members are extremely important in the UMC. The Professing Members are part of all major decisions in the church. General, Jurisdictional, Central, and Annual Conferences are all required to have an equal number of laity and clergy.

In a [[local church]], many decisions are made by an administrative board or council. This council is made up of laity representing various other organizations within the local church. The elder or local pastor sits on the council as a voting member.<ref>The United Methodist Book of Discipline, 2004, para. 252k.</ref>

Additionally, Laity may serve the church in several distinct roles including:

===Lay servant===
Another position in the United Methodist Church is that of the lay servant. Although not considered clergy, lay servants often preach during services of worship when an ordained [[elder (Methodism)|elder]], Local Pastor, Associate Member or [[deacon]] is unavailable.<ref name="UMC LSM- Lay Speaking Ministries and The Book of Discipline" /><ref name="UMC GBOD-lay speaking history" /> There are two categories of lay servants: ''local church lay servant'',<ref name="UMC GBOD-lay speaker" /> who serve in and through their [[local church]]es, and ''certified lay servants'', who serve in their own churches, in other churches, and through district or conference projects and programs.<ref name="UMC GBOD-lay speaker" /> To be recognized as local church lay servant,
they must be recommended by their pastor and Church Council or Charge Conference, and complete the basic course for lay servant. Each year they must reapply, reporting how they have served and continued to learn during that year.<ref name="UMC GBOD-lay speaker" /> To be recognized as certified lay servant, they must be recommended by their pastor and Church Council or Charge Conference, complete the basic course and one advanced lay servant course, and be interviewed by the District or Conference Committee on Lay Speaking. They must report and reapply annually; and they must complete at least one advanced course every three years.<ref name="UMC GBOD-lay speaker" />

===Certified lay ministers===
The 2004 General Conference created another class of ministry, the certified lay minister (CLM). CLMs are not considered clergy but instead remain lay members of the United Methodist Church. A Certified Lay Minister (CLM) is a qualified United Methodist layperson called to congregational leadership as part of a ministry team under the supervision an ordained minister. Paragraph 271 in the 2012 Book of Discipline explains Certified Lay Ministry, requirements, and service distinction.

A person wishing to become a CLM enters the certification process, which includes training, support, supervision, and accountability to the District Committee on Ordained Ministry. CLMs are laypeople serving out their call as disciples of Jesus Christ.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gbod.org/leadership-resources/certified-lay-minister |title=Certified Lay Minister |publisher=The United Methodist Church GBOD |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010080738/http://www.gbod.org/leadership-resources/certified-lay-minister |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Ecumenical relations==
Methodism is one tradition within the Christian Church.<ref>[http://www.worldmethodistcouncil.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22&Itemid=9 "Wesleyan Essentials of Christian Faith" August 18, 2009]</ref> The United Methodist Church is active in [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical]] relations with other Christian groups and denominations. It is a member of the [[National Council of Churches]], the [[World Council of Churches]], [[Churches Uniting in Christ]], and [[Christian Churches Together]]. In addition, it voted to seek observer status in the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] and in the [[World Evangelical Fellowship]].<ref name="Thomas C. Oden—NAE" /> However, there are some{{who|date=January 2020}} in the United Methodist Church who feel that false ecumenism might result in the "blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://catalystresources.org/issues/303balmer.html |publisher=Catalyst Online: Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives for United Methodist Seminarians |year=1998 |title=The Future of American Protestantism |access-date=November 11, 2012 |author=Randall Balmer |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415002847/http://catalystresources.org/issues/303balmer.html |archive-date=April 15, 2012 |author-link=Randall Balmer }}</ref>

In April 2005, the United Methodist Council of Bishops approved "A Proposal for Interim Eucharistic Sharing." This document was the first step toward [[full communion]] with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA). The ELCA approved this same document in August 2005.<ref name="ELCA—UMC" /> At the 2008 General Conference, the United Methodist Church approved full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.<ref name="ENI- Methodists Approve Full Communion with ELCA" /> The ELCA approved this document on August 20, 2009 at its annual churchwide assembly.<ref name="Actions: 2009 ELCA Churchwide Assembly • Aug 17–23, 2009 • Minneapolis, Minn."/><ref name="ELCA Assembly Adopts Full Communion with the United Methodist Church" /><ref name="UMC- Vote for Full Communion" />

The United Methodist Church has since 1985 been exploring a possible [[church union|merger]] with three [[Black church|historically African-American]] Methodist [[Christian denominations|denominations]]: the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], and the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church]].<ref name="UMC-Quick Facts" /> A ''Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union'' formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger.<ref name="Commission on Pan-Methodist Cooperation & Union" /> In May 2012, The United Methodist Church entered into [[full communion]] with the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], [[African Union Methodist Protestant Church]], [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church]], and [[Union American Methodist Episcopal Church]], in which these Churches agreed to "recognize each other's churches, share sacraments, and affirm their clergy and ministries."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2012/may/methodists-reach-across-historic-racial-boundaries-with.html |title=Methodists Reach Across Historic Racial Boundaries with Communion Pact|last=Banks|first=Adelle M.|date=May 7, 2012|magazine=[[Christianity Today]]|access-date=November 11, 2012}} (access url updated June 16, 2016)</ref>

There are also a number of churches such as the [[Evangelical Methodist Church in Argentina]], [[Evangelical Church of Uruguay in Uruguay|Evangelical Church of Uruguay]], and [[Methodist Church in India]] (MCI), that are "autonomous affiliated" churches in relation to the United Methodist Church.<ref name="UMC GBGM- MCI" /><ref name="UMC—MCI" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/directory/affiliated-churches-south-america|title=Affiliated Churches: South America – The United Methodist Church|last=Communications|first=United Methodist|website=The United Methodist Church|access-date=May 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528150121/http://www.umc.org/directory/affiliated-churches-south-america|archive-date=May 28, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The UMC is also a member of the [[Wesleyan Holiness Consortium]], which seeks to reconceive and promote Biblical holiness in today's Church.<ref name="Wesleyan Holiness Consortium - Members" /> It is also active in the [[World Methodist Council]], an interdenominational group composed of various churches in the tradition of [[John Wesley]] to [[evangelism|promote]] the [[Gospel]] throughout the world. On July 18, 2006, delegates to the World Methodist Council voted unanimously to adopt the "[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]", which was approved in 1999 by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Lutheran World Federation]].<ref name="UMC—World Methodists approve further ecumenical dialogue" /><ref name="Catholic News Service (CNS)" />

==Membership trends==
[[File:Kent UMC chapel.jpg|thumb|right|A United Methodist chapel in [[Kent, Ohio]], near the main campus of [[Kent State University]]]]
Like many other [[mainline Protestant]] denominations in the United States, the United Methodist Church has experienced significant membership losses in recent decades. At the time of its formation, the UMC had about 11 million members in nearly 42,000 congregations.<ref name="Yearbook" /> In 1975, membership dropped below 10 million for the first time.<ref name="Yearbook"/> In 2005, there were about 8 million members in over 34,000 congregations.<ref name="Yearbook"/> Membership is concentrated primarily in the Midwest and in the South. Texas has the largest number of members, with about 1 million.<ref name="RCMS" /> The states with the highest membership rates are Oklahoma, Iowa, Mississippi, West Virginia, and North Carolina.<ref name="RCMS"/>

By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, total UMC membership was estimated at 11.4 million, with about 7.9 million in the US and 3.5 million overseas. Significantly, about 20 percent of the conference delegates were from Africa, with Filipinos and Europeans making up another 10 percent.<ref name="Tooley Touchstone" />  During the conference, the delegates voted to finalize the induction of the Methodist Church of the [[Ivory Coast]] and its 700,000 members into the denomination.<ref name="Tooley Touchstone"/> Given current trends in the UMC—with overseas churches growing, especially in Africa, and US churches collectively losing about 1,000 members a week<ref name="Tooley Spectator" />—it has been estimated that Africans will make up at least 30 percent of the delegates at the 2012 General Conference,<ref name="Tooley Touchstone"/> and it is also possible that 40 percent of the delegates will be from outside the US.<ref name="Tooley Spectator"/> One [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] bishop has estimated that typical Sunday attendance of the UMC is higher in his country than in the entire United States.<ref name="Tooley Spectator"/>

==Churchwide giving==
Contributions to the local church not only benefit the local congregation, but also have regional, national, and international impact through the United Methodist Church's connectional giving system. The power of this collective giving enables the church to educate clergy, encourage cooperation with other faith communions, fund General Conference, nurture [[historically black colleges]] and [[Africa University]], and support bishops.<ref name = Discipline />

Individuals may also choose to give to the church by naming the Permanent Fund for the United Methodist Church as beneficiary in their estate plans. The Permanent Fund provides a permanent source of funding for the ministries of the United Methodist Church.{{r|Discipline}}
