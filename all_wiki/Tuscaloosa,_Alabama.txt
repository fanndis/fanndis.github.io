Incorporated as a town on December 13, 1819, it was named after [[Tuskaloosa]], the chief of a band of [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean]]-speaking people. They battled and were defeated by forces of Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] in 1540 in the [[Mabila|Battle of Mabila]], thought to have been located in what is now central Alabama.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Herbert J.

Tuscaloosa is the regional center of industry, commerce, healthcare, and education for the area of west-central Alabama known as ''West Alabama''. It is the principal city of the [[Tuscaloosa Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes Tuscaloosa, [[Hale County, Alabama|Hale]] and [[Pickens County, Alabama|Pickens]] counties. In 2013 its estimated metro population was 235,628. Tuscaloosa is also the home of the [[University of Alabama]], [[Stillman College]] and [[Shelton State Community College]].

Tuscaloosa has been traditionally known as the "'''Druid City'''" because of the numerous [[Quercus nigra|water oaks]] planted in its downtown streets since the 1840s.<ref name="Hubbs-2009">Hubbs, Guy (Spring 2009). "Tuscaloosa on My Mind", ''Alabama Historical Association newsletter''. Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 4–5.</ref> The city has become known nationally for the sports successes of the University of Alabama, particularly in football. City leaders adopted the moniker "The City of Champions" after the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide football team]] won the [[BCS National Championship]] in their [[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2009]], [[2011 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2011]], and again in their [[2012 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2012]] seasons.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Tuscaloosa, Alabama}}

===Native American===
[[File:Moundville Archaeological Site Alabama.jpg|thumb|The Moundville site, located a few miles south of Tuscaloosa, was one of the centers of the Mississippian culture.]]

Nearly 12,000 years ago, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s or [[Paleo-Indians]] arrived in what today is referred to as the [[Deep South]].<ref name="guy_prentice">
{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |title=Pushmataha, Choctaw Indian Chief |access-date=2008-02-11 |last=Prentice |first=Guy |year=2003 |publisher=Southeast Chronicles}}</ref> They were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who pursued the [[megafauna]] that became extinct following the end of the [[Pleistocene]] age.

After thousands of years, successive indigenous cultures developed a rich and complex agricultural society. Emerging in the early first millennium of the common era were the people of the [[Mississippian culture]]. Like some of the generations before them, they built large earthwork mounds in planned sites that expressed their cosmology. Their large [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]], built for political and religious rituals roughly from 900AD to 1500AD, expressed their cosmology. Their earthwork mounds and great plazas survive throughout the valleys of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and Mississippi rivers, as well as their tributaries in the Southeast.

{{see also|Moundville Archaeological Site}}

Descendant [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes include the [[Muscogee|Creek or Muskogee people]]. Also among the historical tribes living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Cherokee]] in the interior, believed to have migrated south centuries before from the Great Lakes area. The tribes of the coastal plain and Piedmont included the [[Muskogean]]-speaking [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] (''Alibamu''), [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Koasati]], and [[Mobilian Jargon|Mobile]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/alabama/ |title = Alabama Indian Tribes |access-date = 2006-09-23 |year = 2006 |work= Indian Tribal Records |publisher= AccessGenealogy.com}}</ref>

In 1828, [[Andrew Jackson]] was elected president of the United States. He had gained popularity when he defeated the Creek at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in 1814, following victories in the War of 1812. He long proposed Indian removal to an [[Indian Territory]] to be established west of the Mississippi, to make land available in the Southeast for European-American settlement.<ref name="jackson1829-5">{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/benning-book/ch11.htm | title = Fort Benning – The Land and the People | access-date = 2010-08-07 |author1=Sharyn Kane  |author2=Richard Keeton  |name-list-style=amp | publisher = SEAC}}</ref> Jackson abandoned the policy of his predecessors of treating different Indian groups as separate nations.<ref name="jackson1829-5"/> Instead, he aggressively pursued plans to move all Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River.<ref name="jackson1829-5"/>

Following Congressional passage of the [[Indian Removal Act]], in 1832 the Creek National Council signed the [[Treaty of Cusseta]], ceding their remaining lands east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] to the U.S., and accepting relocation to the Indian Territory. They had already been under pressure from new settlers encroaching on their territory. Most Muscogee-speaking peoples were removed to Indian Territory during the [[Trail of Tears]] in 1834, although some remained behind. Some Muscogee in Alabama live near [[Poarch Creek Reservation]] in [[Atmore, Alabama|Atmore]] (northeast of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]).

===Statehood and origin of name===
[[File:Oldalabamastatecapruinsintuscaloosa.png|thumb|The ruins of the Alabama State Capitol in Tuscaloosa at Capitol Park. The building served as the home of a women's college until it burned down in 1923.]]
The pace of white settlement in the Southeast increased greatly after the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]]. A small assortment of log cabins soon arose near the large [[Creek (people)|Creek]] village at the fall line of the river, which the new settlers named in honor of the sixteenth-century [[Chief Tuskaloosa]] of a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean]]-speaking tribe{{--}}combining the Choctaw words "tushka" or "tashka" ("warrior") and "lusa" ("black").<ref name="city">{{Cite web |title=History of Tuscaloosa |url=https://www.tuscaloosa.com/history |access-date=2020-09-12 |website=City of Tuscaloosa |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Cobb |first=Mark Hughes |date=2009-02-14 |title=Many names associated with Tuscaloosa have a story |language=en |work=Tuscaloosa News |url=https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20090914/News/606109477 |access-date=2020-09-12}}</ref>

In 1817, [[Alabama]] became a [[Alabama Territory|territory]]. On December 13, 1819, the territorial legislature incorporated the town of Tuskaloosa,<ref name="alabama-law-1823">''A Digest of the Laws of the State of Alabama: Containing The Statutes and Resolutions in Force at the end of the General Assembly in January, 1823''. Published by Ginn & Curtis, J. & J. Harper, Printers, New-York, 1828. Title 62. Chapter XXVI. Page 803-805. [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_JvtKAAAAYAAJ/page/n834 <!-- pg=803 --> "An Act to Incorporate the Town of Tukaloosa (sic).—Passed December 13, 1818." (Internet Archive)]</ref> one day before [[United States Congress|Congress]] admitted Alabama to the [[United States|Union]] as a [[U.S. state|state]].

[[File:Wallace at University of Alabama edit2.jpg|thumb|Wallace standing against [[desegregation]] while being confronted by Deputy U.S. Attorney General [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] at the [[University of Alabama]] in 1963]]
From 1826 to 1846, Tuskaloosa was the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] of Alabama. The State House was built at the corner of 6th Street and 28th Avenue (now the site of Capitol Park). In 1831, the [[University of Alabama]] was established and the town's population and economy grew rapidly, but the relocation of the capital to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] caused a severe decline. The state legislature established Alabama State Hospital for the Insane (now [[Bryce Hospital]]) in Tuskaloosa in the 1850s, which helped restore the city's fortunes.

===Civil War===
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] following Alabama's [[secession]] from the Union, several thousand men from Tuscaloosa fought in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] armies. During the last weeks of the War, a brigade of Union troops raiding the city burned the campus of the university. The larger town was also damaged in the battle and shared fully in the South's economic sufferings which followed the defeat.

In the 1890s the construction of a system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] improved navigation to such an extent that Tuscaloosa was effectively connected to the Gulf Coast seaport of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]. This stimulated the economy and trade, and mining and metallurgical industries were developed in the region. By the advent of the 20th century, the growth of the University of Alabama and the mental health-care facilities in the city, along with a strong national economy, fueled a steady growth in Tuscaloosa which continued unabated for 100 years.

===Civil rights movement===
{{Main|Autherine Lucy|Stand in the Schoolhouse Door}}
In the post World War II era, African Americans increased their activism to regain their constitutional civil rights, and challenged southern segregation in numerous ways. In 1952, [[Autherine Lucy]] was admitted to the University as a graduate student, but her admission was rescinded when authorities discovered she was not white. After three years of legal wrangling, [[Thurgood Marshall]] and the [[NAACP]] got a court order preventing the University from banning Lucy and another student based on race. The following year, Lucy enrolled as a graduate student in Library Science on February 3, 1956, becoming the first African American admitted to a white public school or university in the state.<ref name="Clark-1993">{{cite book |title=The Schoolhouse Door: Segregation's Last Stand at the University of Alabama |url=https://archive.org/details/schoolhousedoors00clar |url-access=registration |author=E.

Board of Education]]'' Supreme Court decision. After the riots, the University suspended Lucy from school stating her own safety was a concern; it later expelled her on a technicality. She was active in civil rights for a time, but withdrew later that year. After her expulsion was annulled by the University in 1988, Lucy re-enrolled and completed her M.S. in Library Science in 1992.

[[File:Malone Hood Plaza University of Alabama northeast view.jpg|thumb|Foster Auditorium and Malone-Hood Plaza in 2010. Lucy Clock Tower is in the foreground.]]
On June 11, 1963, [[George Wallace]], governor of [[Alabama]], stood in front of the [[Foster Auditorium]] entrance at [[The University of Alabama]] in what became known as the [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door]] in an attempt to stop [[desegregation]] of that institution by the enrollment of two [[African-American]] students, [[Vivian Malone Jones|Vivian Malone]] and [[James Hood]]. He had created a challenge to federal orders, when confronted by US Deputy Attorney General [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] and [[United States Marshals Service|federal marshal]]s sent in by Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], Wallace stepped aside. President [[John F. Kennedy]] had supported integration of the University of Alabama as well.<ref name="uabint">{{cite news |title=Civil rights pioneer Vivian Jones dies |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-10-13-jonesobit_x.htm |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=2005-10-13 |access-date=2008-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1963/University-of-Alabama/12295509434394-4/ |title=University of Alabama - 1963 Year In Review - Audio |website=UPI.com |date=1998-09-13 |access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>

On June 9, 1964, in an event that later became known as [[Bloody Tuesday (1964)|Bloody Tuesday]], a group of peaceful African-American [[Civil rights]] marchers were beaten, arrested and tear gassed by police in Tuscaloosa while walking from the [[First African Baptist Church (Tuscaloosa, Alabama)|First African Baptist Church]] to the County Courthouse to protest against the segregated restrooms and drinking fountains of this public facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20110426/NEWS/110429803?p=1&tc=pg&tc=ar |title=Old files show city's role in civil rights era |last1=Stevenson |first1=Tommy |date=April 26, 2011  |website=Tuscaloosa News }}</ref>  Thirty-three people were sent to the hospital for treatment of injuries, and 94 were arrested. The events were not witnessed by outside journalists and had little influence outside the local community. A year later, the [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]] events in Selma of a voting rights march attracted national and international coverage and attention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.al.com/news/tuscaloosa/index.ssf/2014/06/bloody_tuesday_tuscaloosa_reme.html |title='Bloody Tuesday': Tuscaloosa remembers civil rights marchers brutalized 50 years ago |author1=Associated Press |date=June 10, 2014 |website=AL.com }}</ref>

James Hood dropped out of the University of Alabama after two months. He later returned and, in 1997, received his [[Ph.D]]. in [[philosophy]]. Malone persisted in her studies at the time and became the first African American to graduate from the university. In 2000, the university granted her an honorary doctorate of humane letters. Later in his life, Wallace apologized for his opposition at that time to [[racial integration]].

In 2010, the university formally honored Lucy, Hood and Malone by renaming the plaza in front of Foster Auditorium as Malone-Hood Plaza and erecting the Autherine Lucy Clock Tower in the plaza.

In the immediate aftermath of the tornado, thousands of rescue workers dug through the wreckage looking for survivors and recovering bodies. More than 450 persons were originally listed as missing in the post-disaster chaos, leading to fears that the death toll could climb rapidly and skepticism about the relatively low fatality figures in relation to the high number of casualties. Rumors abounded that refrigerated trucks were being brought to store unidentified remains, and that countless bodies were beneath area waters. But the fatality figure did not increase (and was later reduced). Most persons listed as missing were later found to have survived.<ref name="maddox" /> During this period, ''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]'' posted an on-line people finder to aid people to find each other, as well as determine who was still missing.<ref>[http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20110428/MULTIMEDIA/110429676 "Help us locate loved ones"]. tuscaloosanews.com, 29 April 2011, Retrieved April 29, 2011</ref>

Two days after the storm, US president Barack Obama and Alabama governor Robert Bentley, and their spouses, Michelle Obama and Diane Bentley, respectively, accompanied Mayor Maddox on a tour of the damage and the recovery efforts, along with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and several Congressional dignitaries. Remarking about the scale and severity of the damage, Obama said, "I've never seen devastation like this, it's heartbreaking", after touring the damaged areas.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2011/04/obama-visits-tornado-devastation.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Top of the Ticket | date=April 29, 2011}}</ref>  Obama pledged the full resources of the federal government toward aiding the recovery efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20110429/NEWS/110429620?p=all&tc=pgall |title=President Obama promises aid, resources |website=TuscaloosaNews.com |date=2011-04-29 |access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref> Bentley—himself a Tuscaloosa native—pledged additional national guard troops.

===Bicentennial===
The city of Tuscaloosa celebrated its 200th birthday on December 13, 2019 with city officials holding various dedications and commemorative events throughout the city, including the displaying of a "bicentennial quilt" and a fireworks display following the 44th Annual West Alabama Christmas Parade, which was dedicated to the city's birthday. The University of Alabama gifted two sculptures to the city, one of a 30 foot-tall, 9,500-pound statue of the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] goddess [[Minerva]]—designed by local artist Caleb O'Connor—at Manderson Landing park along the [[Black Warrior River]], and a sculpture known as The Walkway. According to the Tuscaloosa200.com website, the Walkway is a "replica of the route of the Black Warrior River from [[Demopolis, Alabama|Demopolis]] to Tuscaloosa, it traces milestones in our city's existence and survival, but its twists and turns, ebbs and flows have mirrored our city's past." It was created by sculptor and architect Craig R. Wedderspoon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20191213/tuscaloosa-dedicates-bicentennial-statue|title=Tuscaloosa dedicates bicentennial statue|date=December 13, 2019|work=Tuscaloosa News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213212348/https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20191213/tuscaloosa-dedicates-bicentennial-statue|archive-date=2019-12-13}}</ref><ref name="Tuscaloosa200">[https://www.tuscaloosa200.com/200th-birthday 200th Birthday Tuscaloosa200]</ref>

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Tuscaloosa black warrior river.jpg|188px|thumb|right|The [[Black Warrior River]] as it flows through town. M&O Railroad Trestle Bridge in the background.]]

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], Tuscaloosa has a total area of {{convert|70.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|60.2|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|10.1|sqmi|km2}} is water. Most water within the city limits is in [[Lake Tuscaloosa]], which is entirely in the city limits, and the [[Black Warrior River]].

Tuscaloosa is located at {{coord|33|12|24|N|87|32|5|W|type:city}} (33.206540, −87.534607),<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. It lies on the [[fall line]] of the Black Warrior River, approximately {{convert|193|mi|km}} upriver from the river's confluence with the [[Tombigbee River]] at [[Demopolis, Alabama|Demopolis]]. Because of its location on the boundary between the Appalachian Highland and the Gulf Coastal Plain, the geography of the area around Tuscaloosa is diverse, varying from heavily forested hills to the northeast to a low-lying, marshy plain to the southwest.

===Cityscape===
Major areas of Tuscaloosa city proper include:

*[[West Tuscaloosa, Alabama|West Tuscaloosa]]
*Central/Midtown Tuscaloosa
*Downtown Tuscaloosa
*[[The University of Alabama]] main campus
*[[Alberta City, Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Alberta City]]
*North River
*Hillcrest

===Major highways===
Tuscaloosa is served by many major highways, including [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|I-20]], [[Interstate 59|I-59]], and [[U.S. Route 82]]. I-20/59 run west to east through the southern part of the city, leading northeast 58&nbsp;mi (93&nbsp;km) to [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and southwest 96&nbsp;mi (154&nbsp;km) to [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian, MS]]. US 82 runs northwest to southeast through the city, locally known as McFarland Boulevard, and leads southeast 103&nbsp;mi (166&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] and northwest 59&nbsp;mi (95&nbsp;km) to [[Columbus, Mississippi|Columbus, MS]]. Many other state and local highways run through the city as well, in addition to a tolled bypass on the western side of the city connecting those coming from the west on US 82 to I-20/59 without going through the main part of the city.

===Climate===
[[Image:Snow in tuscaloosa.jpg|thumb|right|A snowstorm paints a winter scene near Lake Tuscaloosa.]]

Typical of the [[Deep South]], Tuscaloosa experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'') with four distinct seasons. The [[Gulf of Mexico]] heavily influences the climate by supplying the region with warm, moist [[air mass|air]]. During the [[autumn|fall]], winter, and spring seasons, the interaction of this warm, moist air with cooler, drier air from the North along [[weather fronts|fronts]] creates precipitation. These fronts usually move from west to east as they track along the [[jet stream]]. Notable exceptions occur during [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]], where storms may move from due south to due north or even from east to west during land-falling [[hurricane]]s. The interaction between low- and high-pressure air masses is most pronounced during the [[severe weather]] seasons in the spring and fall. During the summer, the jet stream flows well to the north of the southeastern U.S., and most precipitation is consequently [[Precipitation (meteorology)#Convectional rainfall|convectional]], i.e., caused by the warm surface heating the air above.

Severe [[thunderstorm]]s can bring damaging winds, large [[hail]], and occasionally tornadoes. An [[December 2000 Tuscaloosa tornado|F4 tornado]] struck Tuscaloosa County in December 2000, killing eleven people. Tuscaloosa was struck by an [[Fujita scale|F2]] tornado in [[January 1997 tornado outbreak#Tuscaloosa, Alabama|January 1997]], which resulted in the death of one person. In April 2011, two tornadoes in a span of twelve days hit the city, the first being an EF3 on [[Tornado outbreak of April 14–16, 2011|April 15]], and the second and more devastating being an EF4 on [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 27]], when more than 50 deaths resulted. The city suffered considerable infrastructure damage.<ref>Fox News Interview April 28, 2011</ref>

Tuscaloosa has a strong-mayor variant [[mayor-council government|mayor-council form of government]], led by a [[mayor]] and a seven-member [[city council]]. The mayor and council members are elected concurrently for four-year terms. The mayor is elected by the city at-large while council members are elected to single-member districts. Neither the mayor nor the members of the city council is term-limited. All elected offices are nonpartisan. Elections take place on the fourth Tuesday of August in years following presidential election years, with run-off elections taking place six weeks later if necessary. Terms begin immediately after election. The most recent municipal elections were held in 2013.

The mayor is the chief executive and administrative officer of the city. His main duty is to oversee the day-to-day operation of city departments pursuant to executing policy enacted by the city council or, in the absence of any council policy, his own discretion. His other duties include preparing an operating budget each year for approval by the city council and acting as ambassador of the city. The mayor also presides over city council meetings but votes only in case of ties. The current Mayor of Tuscaloosa is [[Walter Maddox]], who was elected to office in September 2005. Prior to Maddox, Alvin A. DuPont had served as mayor for 24 years.

Ancient Members of City Council: District 1 - Bobby E. Howard (2005), Burrell Odom (2013); District 2 - Harrison Taylor (1993); District 3 - the same; District 4 - Lee Garrison (1997), Matt Calderone (2013); District 5 - the same; District 6 - Bob Lundell (2005); District 7 - William Tinker, III (2005).

The city council act as the legislative body of the city. It is powered by state law to consider policy and enact law and to make appoints to city boards. The council also considers the budget proposed by the mayor for approval. The majority of work in the council is done by committee. These committees usually consist of three council members, one of whom will be chairman, and relevant non-voting city employees.

Tuscaloosa, as the largest county seat in western Alabama, serves a hub of state and federal government agencies. In addition to the customary offices associated with the county courthouse, namely two District Court Judges, six Circuit Court Judges, the [[District Attorney]] and the [[Public Defender]], several Alabama state government agencies have regional offices in Tuscaloosa, such as the Alabama Department of Transportation and the Alabama State Troopers (the state police).

Tuscaloosa is in the federal jurisdiction of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama]]. There is a courthouse in Tuscaloosa simply called the Federal Courthouse. Several federal agencies operate bureaus out of the courthouse.

Federally, Tuscaloosa is split between the 4th and 7th Congressional Districts, which are represented by [[Robert Aderholt]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) and [[Terri Sewell]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]), respectively. In addition, Alabama's senior [[United States Senate|senator]], [[Richard Shelby]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]), is a resident of Tuscaloosa.

On the state level, the city is split among the 5th, 21st, and 24th Senate districts and 62nd, 63rd, and 70th House districts in the Alabama State Legislature.

In December 2009, construction on the [[United States Federal Building and Courthouse (Tuscaloosa, Alabama)|new federal courthouse]] of Tuscaloosa began. The $67 million building was the centerpiece of a major downtown urban renewal project. According to information released by the General Services Administration, the building is {{convert|129000|sqft|m2}} with parking. It houses the U.S. District Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court and Social Security Administration office.

The Northern District of Alabama has only one facility suitable for holding a major criminal trial in Huntsville. However, Huntsville's lacks the facilities for safely moving criminal suspects in and out of the building safely. Tuscaloosa's new federal courthouse will anchor the federal structure for the whole Northern District of Alabama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20091206/NEWS/912059938?p=1&tc=pg |title=Construction begins on new federal courthouse |website=TuscaloosaNews.com |access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>

The city's industrial and manufacturing base includes [[BFGoodrich|BFGoodrich Tire Manufacturing]], [[GAF Materials Corporation]], [[Hunt Refining Company]], [[JVC|JVC America]], [[Nucor|Nucor Steel]] and Phifer Wire among numerous other operations.

Another significant contributor to the manufacturing segment of the city's economy is the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes-Benz U.S. International]] assembly plant located on a site in Tuscaloosa County located near [[Vance, Alabama|Vance]] approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of downtown. The plant began assembling the [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] in 1997 and the [[Mercedes-Benz R-Class|R-Class]] [[Grand Tourer|Grand Sport Tourer]] in 2005 and just recently began production with the [[Mercedes-Benz GL-Class|GL-Class]]. Plants that supply components to Mercedes-Benz also make their home in Tuscaloosa and add to the economic strength of the city.

The Westervelt Company, a land resources and wildlife management company, has its headquarters in Tuscaloosa. The company was formerly the Gulf State Paper Corporation, with headquarters in Tuscaloosa from 1927 until 2005 when it sold its pulp and paperboard operations to the [[Rock-Tenn Company]] of [[Norcross, Georgia]]. Gulf State Paper Company then restructured to form Westervelt.

Health-care and education serve as the cornerstone of Tuscaloosa's service sector, which includes the [[University of Alabama]], [[DCH Regional Medical Center]], [[Bryce Hospital]], the William D. Partlow Developmental Center, and the Tuscaloosa [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] Medical Center.

[[File:Dinah Washington Cultural Arts Center.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Dinah Washington]] Cultural Arts Center in 2018]]
The [[Bama Theatre]] is a 1,094-seat proscenium theatre located in downtown Tuscaloosa and is operated by The Arts and Humanities Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscarts.org |title=The Arts & Humanities Council of Tuscaloosa, Alabama |website=Tuscarts.org |access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref> The Bama Theatre was built between 1937 and 1938 under the [[New Deal]]-era [[Public Works Administration]] as a [[movie palace]]. At the time of its construction in 1938, it was the only air-conditioned building in Tuscaloosa. The theatre was renovated as a performing arts center in 1976 and housed the Tuscaloosa Symphony Orchestra and Theatre Tuscaloosa troupe until those groups moved into their own facilities.

Today, the Bama Theatre is the residence of the Tuscaloosa Children's Theatre Company and the Tuscaloosa Community Dancers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscaloosachildrenstheatre.com/aboutus.phtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927093619/http://www.tuscaloosachildrenstheatre.com/aboutus.phtml |archive-date=September 27, 2009 }}</ref>  Additionally, it hosts the Arts Council's Bama Art House movie series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bamatheatre.org/bamaarthouse.php |title=Bama Art House |publisher=The Bama Theatre |access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>  The Bama Theatre hosts a Jewish Film Festival in the spring, as well as several traveling film festivals.

[[File:Coleman Coliseum.JPG|thumb|right|[[Coleman Coliseum]]]]Coleman Coliseum is a 15,383-seat multipurpose arena that serves as the city of Tuscaloosa's municipal civic center. Because the City of Tuscaloosa does not have a civic center, the demand for events grew rapidly and the Coliseum doubled its capacity in the 1970s. In the 1990s, marquee concerts and events that the arena had seen in the previous two decades grew scarce as the facility became more outdated and mostly devoted to Crimson Tide athletic events. In the hope that the University could pull more events at the facility, the Coliseum underwent a significant renovation in 2005, costing over $24 million.
The coliseum has hosted a diversity of events including [[commencement exercises]], a visit by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], alumni gatherings, student [[convocation]]s, concerts, operas, ballets, appearances by political figures, [[WCW Saturday Night]], etc. [[Travis Tritt]] filmed his "[[Bible Belt (song)|Bible Belt]]" country music video there. Some of the stars who have performed on its stages include [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Elton John]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]], and [[B.o.B.|B.o.B]].

[[File:Tuscaloosa Amphitheater.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tuscaloosa Amphitheater]]]]In December 2010, construction on the [[Tuscaloosa Amphitheater]] officially wrapped up with the dedication ceremony taking place days after. The 7,470 capacity Tuscaloosa Amphitheater is blocks away from the downtown district and sits at the end of the Riverwalk on the banks of the Black Warrior River. Since its dedication ceremony in March 2011, a variety of performers have played there including [[John Legend]], [[The Lumineers]], [[Flo Rida]], [[Nelly]], [[TLC (group)|TLC]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Odesza|ODESZA]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Widespread Panic]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Jeff Dunham]], [[Jill Scott]], and [[Fun.|Fun]]. The Amphitheater has also held events such as the Blues and Brews Music Festival and a pro boxing match.

===Festivals and events===
[[File:Kenny Chesney Tuscaloosa.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kenny Chesney]] performing at The Jupiter Bar on The Strip]]Prior to each football game is a massive gathering at the UA Quad, where people gather starting on Friday for [[tailgating]] and the University of Alabama holds pep rallies on the Gorgas library steps. The Quad has hosted ESPN's ''[[College Gameday (football)|College Gameday]]'' several times and also is a place to meet Alabama football legends on game day and perform the "Elephant Stomp" (a pre-game parade) to Bryant–Denny Stadium with the Alabama mascot "[[Big Al (mascot)|Big Al]]" and the [[Million Dollar Band (marching band)|Million Dollar Band]].

On the first Thursday of each month, the Tuscaloosa art galleries open their doors for "Art and Soul"—highlighting local artists. There is a shuttle service that runs between this event and [[Northport, Alabama|Northport]]'s "Art Night".

The City of Tuscaloosa holds parades annually for holidays such as New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, St. Patrick's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, and Christmas Day. Holy Spirit Roman Catholic Church also hosts an annual religious procession/parade for Our Lady of Guadalupe on the Virgin of Guadalupe feast day in December, which reflects on both the catholic and Hispanic community.

Other annual city festivals worth noting are:

*'''Weindorf Festival''' – The Weindorf Festival is a cultural German festival in which native Tuscaloosans and German immigrants celebrate Tuscaloosa's bond with Germany through the nearby Mercedes-Benz Automobile Plant and Tuscaloosa's sister City of Schorndorf. The celebration includes German alcoholic beverages, singing, dancing, and other Germanic arts.
*'''[[Sakura]] Festival''' – The Sakura festival celebrates the symbolic moment when a cherry blossom petal detaches itself to float earthward, which reminds one of the paradoxically fleeting, yet enduring, nature of life. Every March Tuscaloosa celebrates its ties with Japan and its Sister City of Narashino City. This festival features a Haiku Contest.
*'''Kentuck Festival of Arts''' – This annual event takes place during the third week in October near the banks of the [[Black Warrior River]] in Historic Downtown Northport. This nationally recognized event brings in visitors and artists from all over the United States. As several hundred talented artists bring their creations, several thousand visitors come to pay tribute to their skills. Those crowds come not only for the art, but also for the artistry of the days of old. Several artisans provide live demonstrations of blacksmithing, furniture making, quilting, and potting. There are music acts performing on stages and many varied foods available.
*'''Moundville Native American Festival''' – This annual festival takes place at the Moundville Archaeological Park. Native American performing artists, craftspeople, and musicians entertain and educate visitors about the rich culture and heritage that makes Southeastern Indians unique. Visitors can look forward to learning about the society and culture that existed there 800 years ago.
*'''Dickens Downtown''' – An annual Victorian holiday celebration known as Dickens Downtown takes place on the first Tuesday night in December in Downtown Northport. Dickens is a community supported gathering to celebrate the true spirit of Christmas involving Theatre Tuscaloosa performing scenes from "A Christmas Carol", local choirs, the 5th Alabama Regimental Band, a real English Town Crier, father Christmas, and business and neighborhood open houses. As the area comes alive with characters and props straight from 'A Christmas Carol', local shops offer hot cocoa and cookies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscaloosabusiness.com/Tuscaloosa_Pages/Tuscaloosa+Festivals~83.html |title=Tuscaloosa Festivals |website=Tuscaloosabusiness.com |access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>
*'''Druid City Arts Festival''' - Since 2010, the DCAF has been held at Government Plaza downtown in the first week of April every year. The annual open-air festival is free for anyone to attend and hosts vendors from around the state of Alabama and the country that display art, amateur and professional alike, that is available for purchase in tents scattered throughout the plaza.

===Port of Tuscaloosa===
The Port of Tuscaloosa is a river port located in the City of Tuscaloosa and administered by the Alabama State [[Port Authority]].[[File:CrimsonwhiteBWRtuscaloosa.png|thumb|right|The ''Crimson White'' on the Black Warrior River]]

The Black Warrior River is bounded along nearly its entire course by a series of [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] and [[dams]]. They form a chain of narrow [[reservoirs]], providing aids to navigation and barge handling as well as [[hydroelectric power]] and drinking water. The Black Warrior River watershed is a vital [[river basin]] entirely contained within Alabama, America's leading state for freshwater [[biodiversity]]. Near Tuscaloosa, the river flows out of the rocky [[Cumberland Plateau]] and enters the sandy East [[Gulf Coastal Plain]]. [[Barge]] transportation in and out of the Port of Tuscaloosa and other commercial navigation make the Black Warrior a silent giant in the state of Alabama's economy.
Though the Port of Tuscaloosa is a small one, it is one of the larger facilities on the Black Warrior River at [[waterway]] [[mile marker]] 338.5. There are no railway connections at this port as they primarily concentrate on the shipment of dry [[bulk commodities]], including [[lignite]], [[coal]] and [[coal coke]]. The federal government and the City of Tuscaloosa share the ownership of the Port of Tuscaloosa; the operation of the port is leased out to Powell Sales and has been run by them since 1997.

At waterway mile marker 343.2 on the opposite side of the river is a steel company with its own tracks at the rear of the plant connecting with the [[Kansas City Southern Railroad]] for barge shipments of iron and steel products such as [[ingots]], bars, rods, steel slabs, plates and coils. Tuscaloosa Steel Corporation was one of the first U.S. steel companies to implement the Steckel Mill Technology.

The Port of Tuscaloosa grew out of the system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River built by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in the 1890s. Its construction opened up an inexpensive transportation link to the Gulf seaport of [[Mobile, Alabama]] that stimulated the [[mining]] and [[metallurgical]] industries of the region that are still in operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimelawyer-alabama.com/port-of-tuscaloosa.asp |title=Port of Tuscaloosa Accidents &#124; Offshore Injury Attorney |website=Maritimelawyer-alabama.com |access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] has maintained a system of locks and dams along the Black Warrior River for over a century to allow navigability all the way up to Birmingham.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Warrior River Watershed Management Plan|url=http://www.adem.state.al.us/programs/water/nps/files/BlackWarriorBMP.pdf|work=adem.state.al.us|publisher=[[Alabama Department of Environmental Management]]|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref> Barge traffic thus routinely runs through Tuscaloosa to the Alabama State Docks at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], on the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Via the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway|Tenn-Tom Waterway]], the city is connected to the [[Ohio River]] valley and beyond.
