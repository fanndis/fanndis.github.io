Since most forms of Western music can make use of the piano, pianists have a wide [[Piano repertoire|repertoire]] and a wide variety of styles to choose from, among them traditional [[classical music]], [[jazz piano|jazz]], [[blues piano|blues]], and all sorts of [[popular music]], including [[rock music|rock and roll]]. Most pianists can, to an extent, easily play other [[musical keyboard|keyboard]]-related instruments such as the [[synthesizer]], [[harpsichord]], [[celesta]], and the [[organ (music)|organ]].

==Pianists past and present==
Modern [[classical music|classical]] pianists dedicate their careers to performing, recording, teaching, researching, and learning new works to expand their repertoire. They generally do not write or transcribe music as pianists did in the 19th century. Some classical pianists might specialize in accompaniment and [[chamber music]], while others (though comparatively few) will perform as full-time soloists.

==Classical ==
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] could be considered the first "concert pianist" as he performed widely on the piano. Composers [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]] from the classical era were also famed for their playing, as were, from the romantic era,  [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninov|Rachmaninoff]]. It was during the Classical period that the piano begins to establish its place in the hearts and homes of everyday people. From that era, leading performers less known as composers were [[Clara Schumann]] and [[Hans von Bülow]]. However, as we do not have modern audio recordings of most of these pianists, we rely mainly on written commentary to give us an account of their technique and style.

==Jazz ==

|alt=A black-and-white photo of a man playing a piano; he is hunched over it and is concentrating deeply.]]Jazz pianists almost always perform with other musicians. Their playing is more free than that of  classical pianists and they create an air of spontaneity in their performances. They generally do not write down their compositions; improvisation is a significant part of their work. Well known jazz pianists include [[Art Tatum]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Oscar Peterson]] and [[Bud Powell]].

==Pop and rock==
Popular pianists might work as live performers (concert, theatre, etc.), session musicians, arrangers most likely feel at home with synthesizers and other electronic keyboard instruments. Notable popular pianists include [[Victor Borge]] who performed as a comedian; [[Richard Clayderman]], who is known for his covers of popular tunes; and singer and entertainer [[Liberace]], who at the height of his fame, was one of the highest-paid entertainers in the world.

==Amateur pianism==

Some people, having received a solid piano training in their youth, decide not to continue their musical careers but choose nonmusical ones. As a result, there are prominent communities of ''amateur pianists'' all over the world that play at quite a high level and give concerts not to earn money but just for the love of music.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Andreas|first1=Møller|title=Professionel pianist leverer dinnermusik til jeres fest af højeste klasse|url=http://www.pianomusic.dk/|website=Pianomusic.dk|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> The [[International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs]], held annually in [[Paris]], attracts about one thousand listeners each year and is broadcast on French radio.

It is notable that [[Jon Nakamatsu]], the Gold Medal winner of the [[Van Cliburn International Piano Competition]] for professional pianists in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] (1997) was at the moment of his victory technically an amateur: he never attended a music conservatory or majored in music, and worked as a high school German teacher at the time; it was only after the competition that he started pursuing a career as a classical pianist.

The German pianist [[Davide Martello]] is known for traveling around conflict zones to play his moving piano. Martello has previously been recognised by the European parliament for his “outstanding contribution to European cooperation and the promotion of common values”.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/paris-attacks-john-lennon-imagine-pianist-davide-martello-klavierkunst|title=Paris attacks: pianist 'drove 400 miles through the night' to pay tribute|first=Jonathan|last=Bucks|date=15 November 2015}}</ref>
