A '''visiting judge''' is a judge appointed to hear a case as a member of a court to which he or she does not ordinarily belong. In [[United States federal courts]], this is referred to as an assignment "'''by designation'''"<!-- redirects here--> of the Chief Justice of the United States (for inter-[[Circuit court#United States|circuit]] assignments) or the [[Chief judge#United States courts of appeals|Circuit Chief Judge]] (for intra-circuit assignments), and is authorized by {{usc|28|292}} (for active district judges) or  {{usc|28|294}} (for retired justices and judges).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://notabeneuh.blogspot.com/2012/04/sitting-by-designation.html |last= Baker |first= Dan |title= Sitting by Designation |work= Nota Bene: a blog by the librarians of the University of Houston O'Quinn Law Library |date= April 25, 2012 |accessdate= September 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= Stahl-Reisdorff |first= Nicholle |url= http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/fjc/visijud3.pdf |format= PDF |title= The Use of Visiting Judges in the Federal District Courts: A Guide for Judges & Court Personnel |accessdate= September 19, 2012}}</ref>

In many [[United States Courts of Appeals]] it is not uncommon for a [[United States District Judge|district judge]] to sit on a panel as a visiting judge; less frequently it is a judge from another circuit (in active service or, more commonly, in [[senior status]]). Retired Supreme Court justices have done the same, including Justices [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]<ref name="globe-saltzman-oconnor">{{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/29/oconnor_to_hear_cases_as_visiting_judge_to_hub_court |title= O'Connor to Hear Cases as Visiting Judge to Hub Court: Ex-Justice to Serve US Appeals Court |last= Saltzman |first= Jonathan |date=April 29, 2008 |accessdate=September 19, 2012 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] }}</ref> and [[David Souter]], and very unusually, sitting Justices (in 1984, for example, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] served as a visiting judge for a [[jury trial]] in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]].<ref name="time-thomas-rehnquist">{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961645,00.html |title= Reagan's Mr. Right |last= Thomas |first= Evan | date= June 30, 1986 |accessdate=May 19, 2013 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref>).
