Putin was born in Leningrad (now [[Saint Petersburg]]) and studied law at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]], graduating in 1975. Putin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of [[Podpolkovnik|Lieutenant Colonel]], before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. He later moved to Moscow in 1996 to join the administration of President [[Boris Yeltsin]]. He served as [[Federal Security Service|Director of the Federal Security Service]] (FSB) and [[Security Council of Russia|Secretary of the Security Council]], before being appointed as Prime Minister in August 1999. After the resignation of Yeltsin, Putin became [[Acting President of Russia|Acting President]], and less than four months later [[2000 Russian presidential election|was elected outright]] to his first term as president and was [[Russian presidential election, 2004|reelected in 2004]].

During his first tenure as president, the [[Russian economy]] grew for eight straight years, with [[GDP]] measured by [[Purchasing power parity|purchasing power]] increasing by 72%, real incomes increased by a factor of 2.5, real wages more than tripled; unemployment and poverty more than halved and the Russians' self-assessed life satisfaction rose significantly.<ref name="challenges_p12">{{cite book |editor=Anders Åslund |editor2=Sergei Guriev |editor3=Andrew C.

In May 1990, Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to the Mayor of Leningrad [[Anatoly Sobchak]]. In a [[The Putin Interviews|2017 interview]] with [[Oliver Stone]], Putin said that he resigned from the KGB in 1991, following the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev, as he did not agree with what had happened and did not want to be part of the intelligence in the new administration.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Oliver |title=The Putin Interviews (Party 2 – 2:10) |url=https://www.sho.com/the-putin-interviews |website=sho.com |publisher=Showtime |accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>

In March 1994, Putin was appointed as First Deputy Chairman of the [[Politics of Saint Petersburg|Government of Saint Petersburg]]. In May 1995, he organized the Saint Petersburg branch of the pro-government [[Our Home – Russia]] political party, the [[Liberalism in Russia|liberal]] [[party of power]] founded by Prime Minister [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]]. In 1995, he managed the [[1995 Russian legislative election|legislative election campaign]] for that party, and from 1995 through June 1997, he was the leader of its Saint Petersburg branch.<ref name="30bio" />

=== 1996–1999: Early Moscow career ===

In June 1996, Sobchak lost his bid for reelection in Saint Petersburg, and Putin who had led his election campaign, refused from joining the team of his successor after this loss. He moved to Moscow and was appointed as Deputy Chief of the {{ill|Presidential Property Management Department|ru|Управление делами Президента Российской Федерации|vertical-align=sup}} headed by [[Pavel Borodin]]. He occupied this position until March 1997. During his tenure, Putin was responsible for the foreign property of the state and organized the transfer of the former assets of the Soviet Union and [[CPSU|Communist Party]] to the Russian Federation.<ref name=Vlast/>

On 9 August 1999, Putin was appointed one of three First Deputy Prime Ministers, and later on that day, was appointed acting Prime Minister of the Government of the Russian Federation by President Yeltsin.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/415278.stm |title=Text of Yeltsin's speech in English |accessdate=31 May 2007 |date=9 August 1999 |work=BBC News }}</ref> Yeltsin also announced that he wanted to see Putin as his successor.

On 16 August, the [[State Duma]] approved his appointment as Prime Minister with 233 votes in favor (vs. 84 against, 17 abstained),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/422001.stm |title=Yeltsin's man wins approval |work=BBC News|date=16 August 1999 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> while a simple majority of 226 was required, making him Russia's fifth PM in fewer than eighteen months. On his appointment, few expected Putin, virtually unknown to the general public, to last any longer than his predecessors. He was initially regarded as a Yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of Boris Yeltsin, Putin did not choose ministers himself, his cabinet was determined by the presidential administration.<ref>Richard Sakwa ''Putin: Russia's choice'', 2008. p. 20.</ref>

Yeltsin's main opponents and would-be successors were already campaigning to replace the ailing president, and they fought hard to prevent Putin's emergence as a potential successor. Following the [[Russian apartment bombings]] and the invasion of [[Daghestan]] by [[mudjahedin]]s, including the former KGB agents, based in the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], Putin's [[law and order (politics)|law-and-order]] image and unrelenting approach to the [[Second Chechen War]] soon combined to raise his popularity and allowed him to overtake his rivals.

While not formally associated with any party, Putin pledged his support to the newly formed [[Unity (Russian political party)|Unity Party]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/polgrupp.exe?Unity |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 July 2001 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010702200941/http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/polgrupp.exe?Unity |archive-date=2 July 2001 }} Norsk Utenrikspolitisk Institutt</ref> which won the second largest percentage of the popular vote (23.3%) in the December 1999 [[Duma]] elections, and in turn supported Putin.

=== 2000–2004: First presidential term ===
[[File:Putin and Yeltsin cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Putin taking the presidential oath beside [[Boris Yeltsin]], May 2000]]

The inauguration of President Putin occurred on 7 May 2000. Putin appointed the [[Ministry of Finance (Russia)|Minister of Finance]], [[Mikhail Kasyanov]], as the Prime Minister.

The first major challenge to Putin's popularity came in August 2000, when he was criticized for the alleged mishandling of the [[Kursk submarine disaster|''Kursk'' submarine disaster]].<ref name=Kursk>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1487112.stm Spectre of Kursk haunts Putin]. [[BBC News]]. 12 August 2001. Retrieved 30 August 2020.</ref> That criticism was largely because it was several days before Putin returned from vacation, and several more before he visited the scene.<ref name=Kursk/>

Between 2000 and 2004, Putin set about the reconstruction of the impoverished condition of the country, apparently winning a power-struggle with the [[Russian oligarch]]s, reaching a 'grand bargain' with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support for—and alignment with—Putin's government.<ref>''Putin: Russia's Choice'', by Richard Sakwa, (Routledge, 2008) pp. 143–150.</ref><ref>''Playing Russian Roulette: Putin in search of good governance'', by Andre Mommen, in ''Good Governance in the Era of Global Neoliberalism: Conflict and Depolitisation in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa'', by Jolle Demmers, Alex E. Fernández Jilberto, Barbara Hogenboom (Routledge, 2004).</ref>

The [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] occurred in October 2002. Many in the Russian press and in the international media warned that the deaths of 130 hostages in the special forces' rescue operation during the crisis would severely damage President Putin's popularity.

=== 2008–2012: Second premiership ===

Putin was barred from a third consecutive term by the [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution]]. First Deputy Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was elected his successor. In a [[Russian power-switching operation 2008|power-switching operation on 8 May 2008]], only a day after handing the presidency to Medvedev, Putin was appointed [[Prime Minister of Russia]], maintaining his political dominance.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/09/world/europe/09russia.html|title=Putin Is Approved as Prime Minister|date=9 May 2008|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Putin has said that overcoming the consequences of the world economic crisis was one of the two main achievements of his second Premiership.<ref name=bbc-demography/> The other was the [[Demographics of Russia|stabilizing the size of Russia's population]] between 2008 and 2011 following a long period of demographic collapse that began in the 1990s.<ref name=bbc-demography/>

At the [[United Russia]] Congress in Moscow on 24 September 2011, Medvedev officially proposed that Putin stand for the Presidency in 2012, an offer Putin accepted. Given United Russia's near-total dominance of Russian politics, many observers believed that Putin was assured of a third term. The move was expected to see Medvedev stand on the United Russia ticket in the parliamentary elections in December, with a goal of becoming Prime Minister at the end of his presidential term.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15045816|title=Russia's Putin set to return as president in 2012|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=24 September 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref>

== Domestic policies ==
{{main|Domestic policies of Vladimir Putin}}
Putin's domestic policies, particularly early in his first presidency, were aimed at creating a vertical [[power structure]]. On 13 May 2000, he issued a decree putting the 89 [[federal subjects of Russia]] into seven administrative [[Federal districts of Russia|federal districts]] and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of those districts (whose official title is Plenipotentiary Representative).<ref>{{cite book|author1=World Freedom Foundation|title=Vladimir Putin – Direct Speech Without Cuts|date=2015|isbn=978-1329390928|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjAyCgAAQBAJ}}</ref>

[[File:Map of Russian districts, 2016-07-28.svg|thumb|On 13 May 2000, Putin introduced seven [[Federal districts of Russia|federal districts]] for administrative purposes. On 19 January 2010, the 8th [[North Caucasus Federal District]] (shown here in purple) was split from [[Southern Federal District]]. On 21 March 2014, the new 9th [[Crimean Federal District]] was formed after the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]], but on 28 July 2016 it was incorporated into Southern Federal District.]]

The construction of a pipeline at a cost of $77&nbsp; billion, to be jointly funded by Russia and China, was signed off on by Putin in Shanghai on 21 May 2014. On completion, in an estimated 4 to 6 years, the pipeline would deliver natural gas from the state-majority-owned [[Gazprom]] to China's state-owned [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] for the next 30 years, in a deal worth $400bn.<ref name="CNPCdeal">{{cite news|title=China and Russia sign $400&nbsp;billion 30-year gas deal|url=http://www.russiaherald.com/index.php/sid/222206767/scat/723971d98160d438/ht/China-and-Russia-sign-400-billion-30-year-gas-deal|accessdate=22 May 2014|work=Russia Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522142123/http://www.russiaherald.com/index.php/sid/222206767/scat/723971d98160d438/ht/China-and-Russia-sign-400-billion-30-year-gas-deal|archive-date=22 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As noted by Russian journalists after the 2018 presidential inauguration, Putin has since 2007 repeatedly predicted that Russia will become "one of the world's fifth largest economies" roughly within 10 years from that date; thus far this target has not been achieved.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://meduza.io/en/short/2018/05/08/when-will-russia-become-the-world-s-fifth-biggest-economy-don-t-ask-vladimir-putin|title=When will Russia become the world's fifth biggest economy?

==== 2014 financial crisis and economic downturn ====
The [[Russian financial crisis (2014–present)|ongoing financial crisis]] began in the second half of 2014 when the Russian ruble collapsed due to a decline in the price of oil and [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|international sanctions against Russia]]. These events in turn led to loss of investor confidence and capital flight.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kitroeff|first1=Natalie Natalie|last2=Weisenthal|first2=Joe|title=Here's Why the Russian Ruble Is Collapsing|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-16/no-caviar-is-not-getting-cheaper-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-russian-ruble-collapse|agency=Bloomberg|date=16 December 2014}}</ref> Though it has also been argued that the sanctions had little to no effect on Russia's economy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sanctions boost Russian economic resilience|url=http://www.dw.com/en/sanctions-boost-russian-economic-resilience/av-38101070|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=24 March 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331122109/http://www.dw.com/en/sanctions-boost-russian-economic-resilience/av-38101070|archive-date=31 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the Sanctions Are Helping Putin|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/how-the-sanctions-are-helping-putin-214963|agency=Politico}}</ref>

Energy, trade, and finance agreements with China worth $25&nbsp;billion were signed in October 2014 in an effort to compensate for international sanctions. The following year, a $400&nbsp;billion 30-year natural gas supply agreement was also signed with China.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-china-banks-idUSKCN0I20WG20141013|title=Russia signs deals with China to help weather sanctions|date=13 October 2014|accessdate=12 January 2015|publisher=CNBC}}</ref>

In 2004, President Putin signed the [[Kyoto Protocol]] treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gases.<ref>''The New York Times''. 6 November 2004. Retrieved 20 April 2008.</ref> However, Russia did not face mandatory cuts, because the Kyoto Protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from 1990 levels and Russia's greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/13640/g8s_gradual_move_toward_postkyoto_climate_change_policy.html|title=G8's Gradual Move toward Post-Kyoto Climate Change Policy |author=Tony Johnson|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Vladimir Putin 21 February 2001-2.jpg|thumb|Putin with religious leaders of Russia, February 2001]]
[[Buddhism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]] enjoyed limited state support in the Putin era. The vast construction and restoration of churches started in the 1990s, continued under Putin, and the state allowed the teaching of religion in schools (parents are provided with a choice for their children to learn the basics of one of the traditional religions or secular ethics). His approach to religious policy has been characterized as one of support for religious freedoms, but also the attempt to unify different religions under the authority of the state.<ref>''A religion for the nation or a nation for the religion: Putin's third way for Russia'', Beth Admiraal, in ''Russian Nationalism and the National Reassertion of Russia'', edited by Marlène Laruelle, (Routledge, 2009).</ref> In 2012, Putin was honored in [[Bethlehem]] and a street was named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-27/bethlehem-street-named-after-putin/4094628|title=Bethlehem street named after Putin|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>

Putin regularly attends the most important services of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] on the main [[Orthodox Christian]] holidays. He established a good relationship with [[Patriarchs of Moscow|Patriarchs]] of the Russian Church, the late [[Alexy II of Moscow]] and the current [[Kirill of Moscow]]. As president, he took an active personal part in promoting the [[Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate]], signed 17 May 2007 that restored relations between the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church and the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] after the 80-year schism.<ref>{{cite press release|title=he President of Russia attended the ceremonial signing of the Act on Canonical Communion that was held in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour|publisher=[[Embassy of Russia in Ottawa]]|date=17 May 2007|url=http://www.rusembcanada.mid.ru/pr2007/022.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211074427/http://www.rusembcanada.mid.ru/pr2007/022.html|archive-date=11 December 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref>

Under Putin, the [[Hasidic]] [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia|FJCR]] became increasingly influential within the Jewish community, partly due to the influence of Federation-supporting businessmen mediated through their alliances with Putin, notably [[Lev Avnerovich Leviev|Lev Leviev]] and [[Roman Abramovich]].<ref name="Russia">''No love lost'', Yossi Mehlman, ''Haaretz'', 11 December 2005.</ref><ref>Phyllis Berman Lea Goldman, (15 September 2003).

While from the early 2000s Russia started placing more money into its military and defense industry, it was only in 2008 that the full-scale [[Russian military reform]] began, aiming to modernize the Russian Armed Forces and making them significantly more effective. The reform was largely carried out by Defense Minister [[Anatoly Serdyukov]] during Medvedev's presidency, under the supervision of both Putin, as the Head of Government, and Medvedev, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armed Forces.

Key elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million; reducing the number of officers; centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres; creating a professional [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] corps; reducing the size of the central command; introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff; elimination of cadre-strength formations; reorganising the reserves; reorganising the army into a brigade system, and reorganising air forces into an airbase system instead of regiments.<ref name=military-reform>{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20081017/117787642.html |title=Military reform to change army structure. What about its substance? |agency=RIA Novosti |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>

The number of Russia's [[military district]]s was reduced to four. The term of draft service was reduced from two years to one. The gradual transition to the majority professional army by the late 2010s was announced, and a large programme of supplying the Armed Forces with new military equipment and ships was started. The [[Russian Space Forces]] were replaced on 1 December 2011 with the [[Russian Aerospace Defence Forces]].

According to the Kremlin, Putin embarked a build up of [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear weapons|Russia's nuclear capabilities]] because of U.S. President [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] decision to withdraw from the 1972 [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]].<ref>{{cite news | last=Majumdar | first=Dave | date=1 March 2018 | title=Russia's Nuclear Weapons Buildup Is Aimed at Beating U.S. Missile Defenses | url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/russias-nuclear-weapons-buildup-aimed-beating-us-missile-24716 | work=The National Interest | location=US| access-date=26 October 2018 }}</ref> Most analysts agree that Russia's nuclear strategy under Putin eventually brought it into violation of the 1987 [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]].

Putin has also sought to increase Russian territorial claims in the Arctic and its military presence here.

An NGO based in the New York City; [[Human Rights Watch]]; in a report entitled ''Laws of Attrition'', authored by Hugh Williamson, the British director of HRW's Europe & Central Asia Division, has claimed that since May 2012, when Putin was re-elected as president, Russia has enacted many restrictive laws, started inspections of nongovernmental organizations, harassed, intimidated, and imprisoned political activists, and started to restrict critics. The new laws include the "foreign agents" law, which is widely regarded as over-broad by including Russian human rights organizations which receive some international grant funding, the treason law, and the assembly law which penalizes many expressions of dissent.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/node/115059 “Laws of Attrition: Crackdown on Russia's Civil Society after Putin's Return to the Presidency,”] Human Rights Watch pdf report 24 April 2013</ref><ref>[https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/24/russia-worst-human-rights-climate-post-soviet-era Russia: Worst Human Rights Climate in Post-Soviet Era, Unprecedented Crackdown on Civil Society] Human Rights Watch Summary 24 April 2013</ref> Human rights activists have criticized Russia for censoring speech of LGBT activists due to [[Russian gay propaganda law|"the gay propaganda law"]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/kyrgyzstan-lgbt-community-fear-attacks-russia|title='We'll cut off your head': open season for LGBT attacks in Kyrgyzstan|last=North|first=Andrew|date=4 May 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 June 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> and increasing violence against LGBT+ people due to the law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/russia-rise-homophobic-violence|title=Russian anti-gay law prompts rise in homophobic violence|last=Luhn|first=Alec|date=1 September 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 June 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/10/09/russian_lgbt_activists_on_the_effects_of_gay_propaganda_law.html|title=The Chilling Effects of Russia's Anti-Gay Law, One Year Later|last=Keating|first=Joshua|date=9 October 2014|work=Slate|access-date=21 June 2017|issn=1091-2339}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russias-lgbt-youth-victimized-by-gay-propaganda-law-49524|title=Russia's LGBT Youth Victimized by 'Gay Propaganda' Law|access-date=21 June 2017}}</ref>

In the early 2000s, Putin and others in his government began promoting the idea in Russian media that they are the modern-day version of the 17th-century [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] tsars who ended Russia's "[[Time of Troubles]]", meaning they claim to be the peacemakers and stabilizers after the fall of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levin|first=Eve|date=Fall 2011|title=Muscovy and Its Mythologies|journal=Kritika: Explorations in Russian & Eurasian History|volume=12|issue=4|pages=773–788|doi=10.1353/kri.2011.0058|s2cid=159746900}}</ref>

=== Promoting conservatism ===
[[File:Vladimir Putin in Pokrova Church (Turginovo) 03.jpg|thumb|Putin attends the [[Christmas in Russia|Orthodox Christmas]] service in the village Turginovo in [[Kalininsky District, Tver Oblast|Kalininsky District]], Tver Oblast, 7 January 2016]]
Putin has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural, and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked [[globalism]] and [[neo-liberalism]] and is identified by scholars with Russian conservatism.<ref>Sergei Prozorov,  "Russian conservatism in the Putin presidency: The dispersion of a hegemonic discourse." ''Journal of Political Ideologies'' 10#2 (2005): 121–143.</ref> Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by the conservative right-wing journalist [[Alexander Prokhanov]], stresses (i) Russian nationalism, (ii) the restoration of Russia's historical greatness, and (iii) systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.<ref>Marlene Laruelle, "The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant‐Garde in Russia."

''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143–165.</ref>

In cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]], head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012 stating Putin's terms were like "a miracle of God."<ref>{{cite book|author=Julia Gerlach and Jochen Töpfer, eds.|title=The Role of Religion in Eastern Europe Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1F6vBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA135|year=2014|publisher=Springer|page=135|isbn=978-3658024413}}</ref> Steven Myers reports, "The church, once heavily repressed, had emerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions...

Mark Woods, a [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister and contributing editor to ''Christian Today'', provides specific examples of how the Church has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Woods|title=How the Russian Orthodox Church is backing Vladimir Putin's new world order|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/how.the.russian.orthodox.church.is.backing.vladimir.putins.new.world.order/81108.htm|website=Christian Today|date=3 March 2016}}</ref> More broadly, ''The New York Times'' reports in September 2016 how the Church's policy prescriptions support the Kremlin's appeal to social conservatives:
: "A fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family, community or nation, the Russian Orthodox Church helps project Russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure, illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization, multiculturalism and women's and gay rights."<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Higgins|title=In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html|work=The New York Times|date=13 September 2016}}</ref>

Under Putin, Russia's relationships with NATO and the U.S. have passed through several stages.

From 2003, when Russia did not support the [[Iraq War]] and when Putin became ever more distant from the West in his internal and external policies, relations continued to deteriorate.

Cohen]], the narrative of the mainstream U.S. media, following that of the [[White House]], became anti-Putin.<ref name=Bi-Partisan/> In an interview with [[Michael Stürmer]], Putin said there were three questions which most concerned Russia and Eastern Europe: namely, the status of [[Kosovo]], the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] and American plans to build missile defence sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, and suggested that all three were linked.<ref name=Sturmer>{{cite book|last=Stuermer|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Stürmer|title=Putin and the Rise of Russia|year=2008|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0297855101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6UsAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=11 June 2012|pages=55, 57 & 192}}</ref> His view was that concessions by the West on one of the questions might be met with concessions from Russia on another.<ref name=Sturmer/>

In a January 2007 interview, Putin said Russia was in favor of a democratic [[Polarity in international relations|multipolar]] world and strengthening the systems of [[international law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/01/18/0726_type82916_117121.shtml|title=Interview for Indian Television Channel Doordarshan and Press Trust of India News Agency|publisher=Kremlin.ru|date=18 January 2007|accessdate=22 June 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504052123/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/01/18/0726_type82916_117121.shtml|archive-date=4 May 2008}}</ref>

In February 2007, Putin criticized what he called the United States' monopolistic dominance in global relations, and "almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations". He said the result of it is that "no one feels safe! Because no one can feel that [[international law]] is like a stone wall that will protect them. Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race".<ref name=Munich>{{cite web|url=http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/02/10/0138_type82912type82914type82917type84779_118123.shtml|title=Speech and the Following Discussion at the Munich Conference on Security Policy (43rd Munich Conference on Security Policy)|date=10 February 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309232547/https://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/02/10/0138_type82912type82914type82917type84779_118123.shtml|archive-date=9 March 2012}}</ref> This came to be known as the [[Munich speech of Vladimir Putin|Munich Speech]], and former NATO secretary [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] called the speech "disappointing and not helpful."<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=Putin's speech: Back to cold war?

Putin had good relations with former American President [[George W. Bush]], and many western European leaders.

The end of 2006 brought more strained relations in the wake of the death by [[polonium]] poisoning of former KGB and [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] officer [[Alexander Litvinenko]] in London, who became an [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent in 2003. In 2007, the crisis in relations continued with expulsion of four Russian [[diplomat|envoys]] over Russia's refusal to extradite former KGB bodyguard [[Andrei Lugovoi]] to face charges in the murder of Litvinenko.<ref name=expul>{{cite news|title=Brown Defends Russian Expulsions, Decries Killings|author1=Gonzalo Vina|author2=Sebastian Alison|name-list-style=amp|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&sid=ajvS9NfMW2EE&refer=uk|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=20 July 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035325/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&sid=ajvS9NfMW2EE&refer=uk|archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref> Mirroring the British actions, Russia expelled UK diplomats and took other retaliatory steps.<ref name=expul/>

In 2015–16, the British Government conducted an inquiry into the death of Alexander Litvinenko.

The report outlined some possible motives for the murder, including Litvinenko's public statements and [[Blowing Up Russia|books]] about [[Russian apartment bombings|the alleged involvement of the FSB in mass murder]], and what was "undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism" between Putin and Litvinenko, led to the murder.

Putin opposed any foreign intervention. In June 2012, in Paris, he rejected the statement of French President [[François Hollande]] who called on [[Bashar Al-Assad]] to step down. Putin echoed Assad's argument that anti-regime ''militants'' were responsible for much of the bloodshed. He also talked about previous NATO interventions and their results, and asked "What is happening in Libya, in Iraq? Did they become safer? Where are they heading? Nobody has an answer".<ref>{{cite web|last=Viscusi|first=Gregory|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-01/hollande-clashes-with-putin-over-ouster-of-syria-s-assad|title=Hollande Clashes With Putin Over Ouster of Syria's Assad|website=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|date=1 June 2012|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>
