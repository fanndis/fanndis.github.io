The '''Joint Entrance Examination''' (''JEE'') is an engineering entrance assessment conducted for admission to various engineering colleges in [[India]]. It is constituted by two different examinations: the [[JEE Main]] and the [[JEE Advanced]].

The Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) conducts the joint admission process for a total of 24 [[Indian Institutes of Technology|Indian Institute of Technology]] campuses, 32 [[National Institutes of Technology|National Institute of Technology]] campuses, 18 [[Indian Institutes of Information Technology|Indian Institute of Information Technology]] campuses and 19 other [[Government Funded Technical Institutes]] (GFTIs) based on the rank obtained by a student in JEE Mains and JEE Advanced.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

There are some institutes, such as the [[Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research]] (IISERs), the [[Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy]] (IIPE), the [[Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology]] (RGIPT), the [[Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology]] (IIST), and the [[Indian Institute of Science]] (IISc), which use the score obtained in the JEE Advanced examination as the basis for admission. These institutes do not participate in the post-examination counselling session (JoSAA). Any student who takes admission to an Indian Institute of Technology cannot appear for the JEE Advanced examination again, but the same is not the case with IISc, IISERs, RGIPT, IIPE and IIST since they have separate and exclusive counselling sessions.{{clarify|date=September 2020|reason=What is meant by "separate and exclusive counselling sessions" and what do these have to do with a student's rights to retake the JEE Advanced exam?}}

==JEE Main==
{{Main|Joint Entrance Examination – Main}}

JEE Main has two papers, Paper-I and Paper-II. Candidates may opt for either or both of them. Both papers contain [[multiple choice]] questions. Paper-I is for admission to B.E./B.Tech courses and is conducted in a Computer Based Test mode. Paper-II is for admission in B.Arch and B.Planning courses and will also be conducted in Computer Based Test mode except for one paper, namely the 'Drawing Test' which shall be conducted in Pen and Paper mode or offline mode. From January 2020 an additional Paper - III is being introduced for [[Bachelor of Planning|B.Planning]] courses separately.<ref>{{cite web |title=Public Notice for JEE Mains 2020 |url=https://jeemain.nta.nic.in/WebInfo/Handler/FileHandler.ashx?i=File&ii=7&iii=Y |website=NTA JEE Mains |publisher=National Testing Agency |accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>

JEE Main, unlike JEE Advanced, has a fixed exam structure and is not subject to change every year. Paper-1 is of three hours duration and consists of thirty multiple-choice (single-correct) questions in each of the three subjects (physics, chemistry and maths). 4 marks are awarded for correct answers and 1 mark is deducted for incorrect answers.

A new pattern consisting of 20+5 questions per subject is introduced in January 2020 with 20 multiple choice questions + 5 numerical type question.  In multiple-choice questions 4 marks are awarded for correct answers and no marks are deducted from numerical type questions.<ref>{{cite web |title=JEE Main Public Notice 2020 |url=https://jeemain.nta.nic.in/WebInfo/Handler/FileHandler.ashx?i=File&ii=7&iii=Y |website=NTA JEE Main 2020 |publisher=National Testing Agency |accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>

From 2013 to 2016, the marks obtained in the class XII school board examination used to be accorded a 40% weightage in deciding the JEE Main all India ranks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/entrance-exams/40-weightage-to-class-XII-marks-in-JEE/articleshow/16677482.cms|title=40% weightage to class XII marks in JEE|publisher=[[Times of India]]|date=Oct 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/class-12-marks-will-not-impact-jee-main-rank/story-0TFgk24R6Gt1pougm34peM.html|title=Class 12 marks will not impact JEE Main rank: HRD ministry|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=April 8, 2016}}</ref>

In 2012, the government-run [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE) that earlier conducted the AIEEE, announced the JEE that replaced the [[AIEEE]] and [[IIT-JEE]]. The JEE-Main, which replaces AIEEE, is for admission to the [[National Institutes of Technology]] (NITs), [[Indian Institutes of Information Technology]] (IIITs), and some other colleges designated as "centrally funded technical institutes" (CFTIs). The JEE-Advanced, which replaces IIT-JEE, is for admission to the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs). Only the students selected in JEE Main are eligible for appearing in JEE Advanced. About 224,000 students will be selected from 2018.

In September 2013, the IIT Council approved the decision of the Joint Admission Board to continue with the two-phase JEE pattern ("Main" followed by "Advanced") for IITs in 2014. Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) conducted the joint admission process for a total of 23 IITs, ISM, 32 NITs, 18 IIITs and 19 other Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/3200-engineering-seats-vacant-govt-makes-Rs-14-crore/articleshow/48302569.cms?|title=3,200 engineering seats vacant, govt makes Rs 14 crore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/Only-591-seats-vacant-at-IITs-ISM-Dhanbad/articleshow/48065255.cms|title=Only 591 seats vacant at IITs, ISM Dhanbad}}</ref>
