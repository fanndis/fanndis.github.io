==History==
===PepsiCo fast food division===
The company's history traces back to 1977, when [[PepsiCo]] entered into the restaurant business by acquiring [[Pizza Hut]].

===Tricon Global Restaurants===
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from [[PepsiCo]]'s fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=YUM |title=Yum!

Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters, near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.<ref name=lat2/>

In 2000, Tricon Global tested multi-branded locations with [[A&W Restaurants|Yorkshire Global Restaurants]]. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.<ref name=pr>{{cite press release | title = Tricon Global Restaurants announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Long John Silver's and A&W All American Food Restaurants, owned by Yorkshire Global Restaurants | url = http://www.bison.com/press_Tricon_03122002 | publisher = Tricon Global Restaurants| agency =Bison.com | date =March 2002 | access-date   =November 9, 2015 }}</ref>

In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. KFC also hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.<ref>{{cite news|title=KFC taps 'Seinfeld' star, starts 'Wing Works' test |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_32_35/ai_77107180/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716083110/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_32_35/ai_77107180/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 16, 2012 |newspaper=Nation's Restaurant News |publisher=Lebhar-Friedman |date=August 6, 2001 |access-date=January 26, 2011 }}</ref>

===Yum! Brands===
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of [[Lexington, Kentucky]]-based [[Yorkshire Global Restaurants]], owner of the [[Long John Silver's]] and [[A&W Restaurants]]<ref name="sale" /> chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. to match its NYSE ticker symbol. The acquisition was finalized on May 8, 2002, and the name change became effective on May 22, 2002<ref>{{cite news|title=Tricon to Change Name to Yum!

In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with [[Pasta Bravo]], [[Back Yard Burgers]], and A&W.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pizza Hut, Pasta Bravo Test Co-Branding|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/54404|access-date=November 10, 2015|work=Entrepreneur|agency=Nation's Restaurant News|date=August 6, 2002}}</ref> The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.<ref name="nrn">{{cite news|title=Yum buys Pasta Bravo rights for P.

An [[East Dawning]] test [[cafeteria-style restaurant]] was opened in [[Shanghai]] in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.<ref name="wsj_20061020">{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116127912953397916-search.html|title=One U.S. Chain's Unlikely Goal: Pitching Chinese Food in China|last=Adamy|first=J.|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 20, 2006}}</ref> As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yum.com/investors/restcounts.asp|title=Yum!

In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yum puts A&W, Long John Silver's up for sale |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41136858 |work=NBC News |agency=Associated Press |date=January 18, 2011 |access-date=January 20, 2011}}</ref> The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011 announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and Long John Silver's will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.<ref name="sale">{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/yum-sells-2-fast-food-chains/ |title=Yum Sells 2 Fast-Food Chains |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 22, 2011}}</ref>

In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese [[hot pot]] chain [[Little Sheep]] for [[Hong Kong Dollar|HK$]]4.56 billion.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jin|first1=Tony|title=Uncertainty Surfaces Over Yum's Takeover of Little Sheep|url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/articles/uncertaintysurf-8863/|access-date=November 11, 2015|work=China Perspective|date=October 27, 2011}}</ref> The deal spent more than 4 months in antitrust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.<ref name=cp>{{cite news|last1=Guang|first1=Yin|title=China Corporate News: Yum's Little Sheep Takeover Review Cleared|url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/articles/chinacorporaten-8897/|access-date=November 11, 2015|work=China Perspective|date=November 8, 2011}}</ref>

In 2012, a KFC opened in [[Ramallah]] and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the [[West Bank]]; a Pizza Hut is also planned.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/02/kfc-pizza-hut-in-the-palestinian-territories.html#more American fried chicken comes to the Palestinian territories], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 4, 2012, access date February 20, 2012</ref>

In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! had lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25th, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yum Brands' chicken in China contained excessive chemical levels, report says|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/blog/morning_call/2013/01/yum-brands-chicken-in-china-contained.html|access-date=January 26, 2013|newspaper=Business First|date=January 25, 2013}}</ref>

The company opened its first restaurant in [[Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia]], in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country.
