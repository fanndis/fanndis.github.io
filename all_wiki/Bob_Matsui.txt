==Early life==
A [[Sansei|third-generation]] [[Japanese American]], Matsui was born in [[Sacramento, California]],<ref name=biodirectory/> and was six months old when he and his family were taken from Sacramento and [[Japanese American Internment|interned]] by the U.S. government at the [[Tule Lake National Monument|Tule Lake War Relocation Center]] in 1942.<ref name=official>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/matsui/bio.html|title=Official biography|accessdate=2017-04-18|url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208103635/http://www.house.gov/matsui/bio.html|archivedate=December 8, 2004}}, house.gov/matsui; retrieved January 9, 2007.</ref>

Matsui graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1963 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in political science, and then graduated from [[Hastings College of Law]] in 1966.<ref name=biodirectory/> He founded his own Sacramento law practice in 1967.<ref name=official/>

==Political career==

In 1971 Matsui was elected to the [[Sacramento City Council]].<ref name=official/> He won re-election in 1975, and became vice mayor of the city in 1977.<ref name=official/>

In 1978, Matsui ran for the Democratic nomination in what was then the 3rd District after 12-term incumbent [[John E. Moss]] announced his retirement. He won a five-way Democratic primary with 36 percent of the vote, besting a field that included [[California State Assembly|State Assemblyman]] Eugene Gualco and [[list of mayors of Sacramento, California|Sacramento Mayor]] [[Phillip Isenberg|Phil Isenberg]].<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=567204 1978 Democratic primary results  in California's 3rd congressional district], Ourcampaigns.com; accessed January 13, 2018.</ref>

He defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Sandy Smolley with 53 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30951|title=Our Campaigns - CA District 3 Race - Nov 07, 1978|website=Ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>  He would never face another contest nearly that close in what has long been the most Democratic district in interior California, and would be reelected 13 times. After his initial contest, he never dropped below 68 percent of the vote. He was reelected in 1982 with no major-party opposition, and was unopposed in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=665|title=Our Campaigns - Candidate - Robert T. Matsui|website=Ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref> His district was renumbered as the 5th District after the 1990 Census.

In 1988, Matsui succeeded in helping pass the [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]], which produced an official apology from the Federal government for the [[World War II]] [[Japanese American Internment|internment program]] and offered token compensation to victims. He was also instrumental in the designation of [[Manzanar internment camp]] as a national historic site and in obtaining land in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the memorial to Japanese-American patriotism in World War II.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

He was a chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]], [[ranking member]] of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]], and third-ranking Democrat on the [[U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]]. During his term he was noted for his staunch opposition to privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. He had a mostly liberal voting record having opposed the Defense of Marriage Act, the ban on partial-birth abortions, and the Private Securities and Litigations Reform Act.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In what would be his last election, [[2004 U.S. House election|2004]], he faced Republican Mike Dugas and easily won a 14th term with 71.4% of the vote, compared to Dugas' 23.4%. Opponents Pat Driscoll ([[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]]) and John Reiger ([[Peace and Freedom Party (United States)|Peace and Freedom Party]]), won 3.4% and 1.8% of the vote, respectively.<ref>{{cite web | title = General Election results, U.S. Congressional district 5 | publisher = California Secretary of State | date = 2004-12-07 | url = http://vote2004.ss.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/0500.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070323064638/http://vote2004.ss.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/0500.htm | archive-date = 2007-03-23 | url-status = dead }}</ref> (DCCC chairs are chosen in part because they are not expected to face serious competition for re-election.)

==Personal life==
He was married to the former [[Doris Matsui|Doris Okada]] who, until December 1998, worked as deputy assistant to the [[President of the United States|President]] and Deputy Director of Public Liaison for President [[Bill Clinton]], leaving to become senior advisor and director of government relations at the firm of Collier Shannon Scott, PLLC before winning election to her late husband's seat. The Matsuis had one son, Brian, who received his undergraduate and law degrees from [[Stanford University]].

==Death==
In late 2004, Matsui entered [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] with [[pneumonia]] on December 24.<ref name=cnnobituary/> It was a complication from [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], a rare [[stem cell]] disorder that causes an inability of the [[bone marrow]] to produce blood products, such as [[red blood cell]]s, [[white blood cell]]s and [[platelet]]s. He died of pneumonia on January 1, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/03/obituaries/representative-robert-t-matsui-63-dies.html|title=Representative Robert T.
