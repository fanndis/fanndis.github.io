'''Felix Frankfurter''' (November 15, 1882{{snd}}February 22, 1965) was an [[Austrian-American]] lawyer, professor, and [[jurist]] who served as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]]. Frankfurter served on the Supreme Court from 1939 to 1962 and was a noted advocate of [[judicial restraint]] in the judgments of the Court.

Frankfurter was born in [[Vienna]], Austria, and immigrated to [[New York City]] at the age of 12. After graduating from [[Harvard Law School]], Frankfurter worked for [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]]. During [[World War I]], Frankfurter served as [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]]. After the war, he helped found the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and returned to his position as professor at Harvard Law School. He became a friend and adviser of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who appointed him to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Benjamin Cardozo]].

Frankfurter served on the Court until his retirement in 1962, and was succeeded by [[Arthur Goldberg]]. Frankfurter wrote the Court's majority opinions in cases such as ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'', ''[[Gomillion v. Lightfoot]]'', and ''[[Beauharnais v. Illinois]]''. He wrote dissenting opinions in notable cases such as ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'', ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'', ''[[Glasser v. United States]]'', and ''[[Trop v. Dulles]]''.

==Early life and education==
Frankfurter was born into a [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] family on November 15, 1882, in [[Vienna]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. He was the third of six children of Leopold Frankfurter, a merchant, and Emma (Winter) Frankfurter.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mishra |first=Patit P. |chapter=Felix Frankfurter |title=The Home Front Encyclopedia: United States, Britain, And Canada in World Wars I And II |url=https://archive.org/details/homefrontencyclo00cime |url-access=limited |editor-first=James D. |editor-last=Ciment |editor2-first=Thaddeus |editor2-last=Russell |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2007 |isbn=978-1576078495 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/homefrontencyclo00cime/page/n98 76]–77 }}</ref> His uncle, Solomon Frankfurter, was head librarian at the [[Vienna University Library]].<ref>{{Jewish Encyclopedia |no-prescript=1 |title= Frankfurter, Solomon |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6314-frankfurter-solomon }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=H.

Frankfurter attended [[List of public elementary schools in New York City|P.S. 25]], where he excelled at his studies and enjoyed playing [[chess]] and shooting [[craps]] on the street. He spent many hours reading at [[The Cooper Union|The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art]] and attending political lectures, usually on subjects such as [[trade unionism]], socialism and communism.<ref name="Harvnb1">{{Harvnb|Murphy|2003|p=264}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Alexander|2001|p=77}}</ref>

After graduating in 1902 from [[City College of New York]], where he was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]],<ref>{{cite web| last= Knott| first= K.| year= 2009| title= Supreme Court Justices Who Are Phi Beta Kappa Members| publisher= Phi Beta Kappa| access-date= October 4, 2009| url= http://www.pbk.org/userfiles/file/Famous%20Members/PBKSupremeCourtJustices.pdf| website= PBK.org| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110928082723/http://www.pbk.org/userfiles/file/Famous%20Members/PBKSupremeCourtJustices.pdf| archive-date= September 28, 2011| url-status= dead}}</ref> Frankfurter worked for the Tenement House Department of New York City to raise money for law school. He applied successfully to [[Harvard Law School]], where he excelled academically and socially. He became lifelong friends with [[Walter Lippmann]] and [[Horace Kallen]], became an editor of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', and graduated first in his class with one of the best academic records since [[Louis Brandeis]].<ref name="Harvnb1"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Alexander|2001|pp=77–8}}</ref>

==Early career==
Frankfurter's legal career began when he joined the New York law firm of Hornblower, Byrne, Miller & Potter in 1906. In the same year, he was hired as the assistant to [[Henry Stimson]], the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.<ref>{{Harvnb|Murphy|2003|pp=264–65}}</ref>  During this period, Frankfurter read [[Herbert Croly]]'s book ''[[The Promise of American Life]]'', and became a supporter of the [[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]] and of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. In 1911, President [[William Howard Taft]] appointed Stimson as his [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], and Stimson appointed Frankfurter as law officer of the [[Bureau of Insular Affairs]]. Frankfurter worked directly for Stimson as his assistant and confidant. His government position restricted his ability to publicly voice his Progressive views, though he expressed his opinions privately to friends such as Judge [[Learned Hand]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunther|1994|pp=221–22}}</ref> In 1912 Frankfurter supported the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Bull Moose campaign]] to return Roosevelt to the presidency, and was bitterly disappointed when [[Woodrow Wilson]] was elected. He became increasingly disillusioned with the established parties, and described himself as "politically homeless".<ref>{{Harvnb|Alexander|2001|p=82}}</ref>

==First World War==
Frankfurter's work in Washington had impressed the faculty at Harvard Law School, who used a donation from the financier [[Jacob Schiff]] to create a position for him there after Louis Brandeis suggested that Schiff do this. He taught mainly [[administrative law]] and occasionally [[criminal law]].<ref name =A8384/> With fellow [[professor]] [[James M. Landis]], he advocated judicial restraint in dealing with government misdeeds, including greater freedom for administrative agencies from judicial oversight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carrington|1999|p=132}}</ref> He also served as counsel for the [[National Consumers League]], arguing for Progressive causes such as [[minimum wage]] and restricted work hours.<ref name="Slater"/><ref name =A8384>{{Harvnb|Alexander|2001|pp=83–4}}</ref> He was involved in the early years of ''[[The New Republic]]'' magazine after its founding by [[Herbert Croly]].<ref name="Slater"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Gunther|1994|p=244}}</ref>

[[File:Judge Advocate General Logo.png|thumb|250px|U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General logo]]
When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Frankfurter took a special leave from Harvard to serve as special assistant to the Secretary of War [[Newton D. Baker]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunther|1994|p=253}}</ref> He was appointed [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]], supervising military [[courts-martial]] for the War Department.<ref>{{Harvnb|Irons|1999|p=267}}</ref>  He was commissioned a major in the Officers Reserve Corps but was not called to active duty.

In September 1917, he was appointed counsel to a commission, the President's Mediation Committee, established by President Wilson to resolve major strikes threatening war production. Among the disturbances he investigated were the 1916 [[Preparedness Day Bombing]] in San Francisco, where he argued strongly that the radical leader [[Thomas Mooney]] had been [[Frameup|framed]] and required a new trial.<ref name=Alex84/> He also examined the [[Copper mining in Arizona|copper industry in Arizona]], where industry bosses solved industrial relations problems by having more than 1,000 strikers forcibly deported to New Mexico.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunther|1994|pp=353–4}}</ref> Overall, Frankfurter's work gave him an opportunity to learn firsthand about labor politics and extremism, including [[anarchism]], communism and [[revolutionary socialism]]. He came to sympathize with labor issues, arguing that "unsatisfactory, remediable social conditions, if unattended, give rise to radical movements far transcending the original impulse."  His activities led the public to view him as a radical lawyer and supporter of radical principles.<ref name=Alex84>{{Harvnb|Alexander|2001|pp=84–7}}</ref> Former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] accused him of being "engaged in excusing men precisely like the Bolsheviki in Russia."<ref name =Murphy265/>

==Post First World War==
As the war drew to a close, Frankfurter was among the nearly one hundred intellectuals who signed a statement of principles for the formation of the League of Free Nations Associations, intended to increase [[United States non-interventionism|United States participation in international affairs]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunther|1994|p=261}}</ref>

Frankfurter was encouraged by Supreme Court Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] to become more involved in [[Zionism]].<ref name="Slater"/> With Brandeis he lobbied President Wilson to support the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]], a British government statement supporting the establishment of a Jewish homeland in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].<ref name="Slater"/> In 1918, he participated in the founding conference of the [[American Jewish Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]], creating a national democratic organization of Jewish leaders from all over the US.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788721,00.html| title= Religion: Jews v.

===Marriage and family===
In 1919, Frankfurter married Marion Denman, a [[Smith College]] graduate and the daughter of a Congregational minister. They married after a long and difficult courtship, and against the wishes of his mother, who was disturbed by the prospect of her son marrying outside the Jewish faith.<ref name =Murphy265/><ref>{{Citation|last=Polenberg|first=Richard|title=The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2007|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lettersofsaccova00sacc/page/ xxi]|chapter=Introduction|isbn=978-0-14-310507-7|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeZXA2FVt34C&q=Marion+Denman&pg=PR21|no-pp=true|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersofsaccova00sacc/page/}}</ref> Frankfurter was a non-practicing Jew, and regarded religion as "an accident of birth". Frankfurter was a domineering husband and Denman suffered from frail health. She suffered frequent mental breakdowns.<ref name =Murphy265>{{Harvnb|Murphy|2003|p=265}}</ref> The couple had no children.

===Founding ACLU===
Frankfurter's activities continued to attract attention for their alleged radicalism. In November 1919, he chaired a meeting in support of [[Foreign_relations_of_the_Soviet_Union#Respectability_and_normal_relations|American recognition]] of the newly created [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunther|1994|p=358}}</ref> In 1920, Frankfurter helped to found the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].<ref name="Slater"/> Following the arrest of suspected communist radicals in 1919 and 1920 during the [[Palmer raids]], Frankfurter, together with other prominent lawyers including [[Zechariah Chafee]], signed an ACLU report which condemned the "utterly illegal acts committed by those charged with the highest duty of enforcing the laws" and noted they had committed entrapment, police brutality, prolonged incommunicado detention, and violations of due process in court. Frankfurter and Chafee also submitted briefs to a [[habeas corpus]] application to the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Federal District Court]]. Judge [[George Weston Anderson|George Anderson]] ordered the discharge of twenty aliens, and his denunciation of the raids effectively ended them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Irons|1999|p=283}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Stone|2004|pp=225–26}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Morris|first1=Norval|last2=Rothman |first2=David J. |title=The Oxford History of the Prison: The Practice of Punishment in Western Society|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1995|pages=358|isbn=978-0-19-511814-8}}</ref> It was during this time that [[J.

In 1921, Frankfurter was given a chair at Harvard Law School, where he continued progressive work on behalf of socialists and oppressed and religious minorities. When [[A. Lawrence Lowell]], the President of Harvard University, proposed to limit the enrollment of Jewish students, Frankfurter worked with others to defeat the plan.<ref name =Murphy265/><ref>{{Harvnb|Gunther|1994|pp=362–65}}</ref>

In the late 1920s, he attracted public attention when he supported calls for a new trial for [[Sacco and Vanzetti]], two Italian immigrant [[anarchist]]s who had been sentenced to death on robbery and murder charges. Frankfurter wrote an influential article for ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' and subsequently a book, ''The Case of Sacco and Vanzetti: A Critical Analysis for Lawyers and Laymen''. He critiqued the prosecution's case and the judge's handling of the trial; he asserted that the convictions were the result of anti-immigrant prejudice and enduring anti-radical hysteria of the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] of 1919–20.<ref name="Slater"/><ref name="rogers">{{Citation|last=Rogers|first=Alan|title=Murder and the Death Penalty in Massachusetts|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-55849-633-0|pages= 187–94| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1sRSYaLh2wIC&q=Frankfurter++Sacco+Vanzetti&pg=PA187}}</ref> His activities further isolated him from his Harvard colleagues and from Boston society.<ref name =Murphy265/>

==Adviser to President Roosevelt==
[[File:Vincenzo Laviosa - Franklin D. Roosevelt - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Franklin Roosevelt in the early 1930s]]
Following the inauguration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1933, Frankfurter quickly became a trusted and loyal adviser to the new president. Frankfurter was considered to be liberal<ref>{{cite journal| title= Review: The Reputation of Felix Frankfurter: The Enigma of Felix Frankfurter by H. N.

Frankfurter successfully recommended many bright young lawyers toward public service with the [[New Deal]] administration; they became known as "Felix's Happy Hot Dogs".<ref name =G437/><ref name =Murphy266/> Among the most notable of these were [[Thomas Gardiner Corcoran|Thomas Corcoran]], [[Donald Hiss]] and [[Alger Hiss]], and [[Benjamin Victor Cohen|Benjamin Cohen]]. He moved to Washington, DC, commuting back to Harvard for classes, but felt that he was never fully accepted within government circles. He worked closely with [[Louis Brandeis]], lobbying for political activities suggested by Brandeis. He declined a seat on the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] and, in 1933, the position of [[Solicitor General of the United States]].<ref name =Murphy266/>
Long an [[anglophile]], Frankfurter had studied at Oxford University in 1920. In 1933–34 he returned to act as visiting Eastman professor in the faculty of Law.<ref name =Murphy266>{{Harvnb|Murphy|2003|p=266}}</ref><ref name="berlin">{{Citation|last=Berlin|first=Isaiah|title=Personal Impressions|editor-last=Hardy|editor-first=Henry|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2001|pages=[https://archive.org/details/personalimpressi00berl_1/page/112 112–19]|chapter=Felix Frankfurter at Oxford|isbn=978-0-691-08858-7|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwdPuPywwlMC&q=felix+frankfurter+Oxford&pg=PA112|url=https://archive.org/details/personalimpressi00berl_1/page/112}}</ref>

Even after his appointment to the Supreme Court, Frankfurter remained close to Roosevelt. In July 1943, on behalf of the President, Frankfurter interviewed [[Jan Karski]], a member of the Polish resistance who had been smuggled into the Warsaw ghetto and a camp near the Belzec death camp in 1942, in order to report back on what is now known as the Holocaust. Frankfurter greeted Karski's report with skepticism, later explaining: "I did not say that he was lying, I said that I could not believe him. There is a difference."<ref>{{cite web |title=Jan Karski |url=http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/saviors/diplomats/list/jan-karski-820/ |website= raoulwallenberg.net| publisher= [[International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation]] |access-date=February 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YVTfG_qE2Y |title= Jan Karski about his meeting with Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, 1943| via= YouTube.com}}</ref>

==Supreme Court justice==
[[File:Frankfurter Nomination.JPG|thumb|alt= |Frankfurter's Supreme Court nomination]]
Following the death of Supreme Court Justice [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] in July 1938, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] asked his old friend Frankfurter for recommendations of prospective candidates for the vacancy. Finding none on the list to suit his criteria, Roosevelt nominated Frankfurter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Irons|1999|pp=327–8}}</ref> The Senate [[Confirmation hearing#United States|confirmation hearing]] on the nomination of Frankfurter was notable for the opposition which arose. In addition to the objection that he was considered to be the President's unofficial advisor, that he was affiliated with special interest groups, that there were now no justices from west of the Mississippi, opposing groups and individuals appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee pointed to Frankfurter as foreign-born and deemed to be affiliated with an anti-Christian movement viewed as part of a broader Communist infiltration into the country.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lusk Committee {{!}} L0031.

Frankfurter served from January 30, 1939 to August 28, 1962. He wrote 247 opinions for the Court, 132 concurring opinions, and 251 dissents.<ref>{{cite journal| url= http://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/mlr/vol70/iss4/13 |publisher= University of Missouri School of Law| journal= Missouri Law Review| title= Why Do Supreme Court Justices Succeed or Fail?

Dowd]],'' Frankfurter stated what was for him a frequent theme: "The federal judiciary has no power to sit in judgment upon a determination of a state court... Something that thus goes to the very structure of our federal system in its distribution of power between the United States and the state is not a mere bit of red tape to be cut, on the assumption that this Court has general discretion to see justice done...".<ref>{{Harvnb|Eisler|1993|pp=161–162}}</ref>

In his [[judicial restraint]] philosophy, Frankfurter was strongly influenced by his close friend and mentor [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], who had taken a firm stand during his tenure on the bench against the doctrine of "economic [[due process]]". Frankfurter revered Justice Holmes, often citing Holmes in his opinions. In practice, this meant Frankfurter was generally willing to uphold the actions of those branches against constitutional challenges so long as they did not "shock the conscience." Frankfurter was particularly well known as a scholar of [[civil procedure]].

Frankfurter's adherence to the judicial restraint philosophy was shown in the 1940 opinion he wrote for the court in ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]],'' a case involving [[Jehovah's Witness]]es students who had been expelled from school due to their refusal to salute the flag and recite the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. He rejected claims that [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment rights]] should be protected by law, and urged deference to the decisions of the elected school board officials. He stated that religious belief "does not relieve the citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities" and that exempting the children from the flag-saluting ceremony "might cast doubts in the minds of other children" and reduce their loyalty to the nation. Justice [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] issued a lone dissent. The court's decision was followed by hundreds of violent attacks on Jehovah's Witnesses throughout the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Irons|1999|pp=338–341}}</ref> It was overturned in March 1943 by the Supreme Court decision on ''[[West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette]]''. A frequent ally, Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]], wrote the majority opinion in this case, which reversed the decision only three years prior in poetic passionate terms as a fundamental constitutional principle, that no government authority has the right to define official dogma and require its affirmation by citizens. Frankfurter's extensive dissent began by raising and then rejecting the notion that as a Jew, he ought "to particularly protect minorities," although he did say that his personal political sympathies were with the majority opinion.<ref>Frankfurter, Felix.  Dissenting opinion.  ''West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette''.  ''Documents of American Constitutional and Legal History'', edited by Urofsky and Finkelman, Oxford UP, 2002, p. 704.</ref>  He reiterated his view that the role of the Court was not to give an opinion of the "wisdom or evil of a law" but only to determine "whether legislators could in reason have enacted such a law".<ref>{{Harvnb|Irons|1999|pp=344–345}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=White|first=James Boyd|title=Living Speech: Resisting the Empire of Force|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|pages=45–47|isbn=978-0-691-12580-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uA_EXBnUA1EC&q=West+Virginia+Board+of+Education+v.+Barnette++Frankfurter+Jackson&pg=PA45}}</ref>

Carr]],'' Frankfurter's position was that the federal courts did not have the right to tell sovereign state governments how to apportion their legislatures; he thought the Supreme Court should not get involved in political questions, whether federal or local.<ref name =E11/> Frankfurter's view had won out in the 1946 case preceding Baker, ''[[Colegrove v. Green]]''&nbsp;– there, a 4–3 majority decided that the case was non-justiciable, and the federal courts had no right to become involved in state politics, no matter how unequal district populations had become.<ref name =E11/><ref>{{Harvnb|Carrington|1999|pp=142–43}}</ref> But, in the ''Baker'' case, the majority of justices ruled to settle the matter&nbsp;– saying that the drawing of state legislative districts was within the purview of federal judges, despite Frankfurter's warnings that the Court should avoid entering "the political thicket."<ref>{{Harvnb|Eisler|1993|p=12}}</ref>

Frankfurter had previously articulated a similar view in a concurring opinion written for the 1951 ''[[Dennis v. United States]]'' Supreme Court ruling. The decision affirmed, by a 6–2 margin, the conviction of eleven communist leaders for conspiring to overthrow the US government under the [[Smith Act]]. In it, he again argued that judges "are not legislators, that direct policy-making is not our province."<ref name="Stone 2004 402–10">{{Harvnb|Stone|2004|pp=402–10}}</ref> He recognized that curtailing the free speech of those who advocate the overthrow of government by force, also risked stifling criticism by those who did not, writing that "[it] is a sobering fact that in sustaining the convictions before us we can hardly escape restriction on the interchange of ideas."<ref name="Stone 2004 402–10"/>

A pivotal [[school desegregation]] case came before the court in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. It was argued, and was set for reargument when Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]], whose vote was crucial and who ostensibly disposed against overruling ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', died. Frankfurter reportedly remarked that Vinson's death was the first solid piece of evidence he had seen to prove the existence of God, though some believe the story to be "possibly apocryphal".<ref name="ariens">[http://www.michaelariens.com/ConLaw/justices/vinson.htm Michael Lariens on Fred Vinson.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902094554/http://www.michaelariens.com/ConLaw/justices/vinson.htm |date=September 2, 2015 }}</ref>

Frankfurter demanded that the opinion in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown II]]'' (1955) order schools to desegregate with "all deliberate speed".<ref name="Armstrong1">{{Harvnb|Woodward and Armstrong|1979|p=38}}</ref> Some school boards used this phrase as an excuse to defy the demands of the first Brown decision.<ref name="Armstrong1"/> For fifteen years, schools in many states of the South remained segregated; in some cases systems closed their schools, and new private schools were opened by white parents for their children.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodward and Armstrong|1979|pp=37–38}}</ref> In ''[[Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education]]'', the Court wrote, "The obligation of every school district is to terminate dual school systems at once and to operate now and hereafter only unitary schools."<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodward and Armstrong|1979|p=55}}</ref> Frankfurter's "all deliberate speed" formula was intended to constrain the federal judiciary toward a gradualist approach to school integration, but his formula backfired. By divorcing the plaintiff's injury from the remedy afforded, ''Brown II'' gave birth to modern Public Law Litigation, which today affords federal courts broad power to reform state institutions.<ref>Mark Tushnet, Public Law Litigation and the Ambiguities of ''Brown'', 61 Fordham L. Rev. 23 (1993) </ref>

Frankfurter was hands-off in the area of business. In the 1956 government case against [[DuPont]], started because DuPont seemed to have maneuvered its way into a preferential relationship with [[General Motors|GM]], Frankfurter refused to find a conspiracy, and said the Court had no right to interfere with the progress of business.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eisler|1993|p=128}}</ref><ref>''The Supreme Court Under Earl Warren, 1953–1969.'' By Michal R. Belknap, Earl Warren. Page 95. University of South Carolina Press.</ref> Here again, Frankfurter opposed - and lost out to - the views of the court majority made up of Justices Warren, Black, Douglas and Brennan.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eisler|1993|p=129}}</ref> Later in his career, Frankfurter's judicial restraint philosophy frequently put him on the dissenting side of ground-breaking decisions taken by the [[Warren Court]] to end discrimination.

Frankfurter believed that the authority of the Supreme Court would be reduced if it went too strongly against public opinion: He sometimes went to great lengths to avoid unpopular decisions, including fighting to delay court decisions against laws prohibiting [[racial intermarriage]].<ref name=dwor>{{Harvnb|Dworkin|1996|p=340}}</ref>

For the October 1948 court term, Frankfurter hired [[William Thaddeus Coleman Jr.]], the first African American to serve as a Supreme Court [[Law clerk#Federal clerkships|law clerk]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Linda |last=Greenhouse |title=Supreme Court Memo; Women Suddenly Scarce Among Justices' Clerks |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/washington/30scotus.html |work=The New York Times |date=August 30, 2006 |access-date=November 28, 2008 }}</ref>

In 1960, despite a recommendation from the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of Harvard Law School, Frankfurter turned down [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] for a clerkship position because of her gender.<ref>{{Citation |first=Neil A. |last=Lewis |title=THE SUPREME COURT: Woman in the News; Rejected as a Clerk, Chosen as a Justice: Ruth Joan Bader Ginsburg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/us/supreme-court-woman-rejected-clerk-chosen-justice-ruth-joan-bader-ginsburg.html |work=The New York Times |date=June 15, 1993 |access-date=August 2, 2015 }}</ref>  Ginsburg later became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, thereby re-establishing the so-called "Jewish seat" on the Court once occupied by Frankfurter.<ref name= jseat>{{cite news| url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/politicaljunkie/2009/05/heres_a_question_from_carol.html| title= The 'Jewish Seat' On The Supreme Court| date= May 28, 2009|website= npr.org| publisher= National Public Radio | access-date= August 29, 2017}}</ref>

==Personal relations on the Court==
Throughout his career on the court, Frankfurter was a large influence on many justices, such as [[Tom C. Clark|Clark]], [[Harold Hitz Burton|Burton]], [[Charles Evans Whittaker|Whittaker]], and [[Sherman Minton|Minton]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Eisler|1993|pp=88, 100, 105}}</ref> He generally attempted to influence any new justice coming in,<ref>{{Harvnb|Eisler|1993|p=100}}</ref> though he managed to repel [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Justice Brennan]]&nbsp;– who had voted with Frankfurter half the time in his first year,<ref>{{Harvnb|Eisler|1993|p=106}}</ref> but then opposed him after Frankfurter's attempts at inculcation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eisler|1993|p=102}}</ref> Frankfurter turned against Brennan completely after the case of ''[[Irvin v. Dowd]]''. Other justices who received the Frankfurter treatment of flattery and instruction were Burton, [[Fred M. Vinson|Vinson]], and [[John Marshall Harlan II|Harlan]].<ref name=H188>{{Harvnb|Hirsch|1981|p=188}}</ref> With Vinson, who became Chief Justice, Frankfurter feigned deference, though he sought influence.<ref name=H189>{{Harvnb|Hirsch|1981|pp=189–90}}</ref> Some, possibly apocryphal, reports<ref name="ariens"/> have Frankfurter remarking that Vinson's death in 1953 was the first solid piece of evidence he had seen to prove the existence of God.<ref>Murphy, Wild Bill:  The Legend and Life of William O. Douglas at 327 (New York:  Random House 2003).</ref>

Justice Frankfurter was in his time the leader of the conservative faction of the Supreme Court; he would for many years feud with liberals like Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]] and [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]].<ref name =E11>{{Harvnb|Eisler|1993|p=11}}</ref> He often complained that they "started with a result" and that their work was "shoddy," "result-oriented," and "demagogic".<ref name=H189/> Similarly, Frankfurter panned the work of Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] as "dishonest nonsense."<ref name=H190>{{Harvnb|Hirsch|1981|p=190}}</ref>

Frankfurter saw justices with ideas different from his own as part of a more liberal "Axis"&nbsp;– these opponents were chiefly Justices Black and Douglas, but would also include [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]] and [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]]; the group would for years oppose Frankfurter's judicially restrained ideology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ball|2006|p=14}}</ref> Douglas, Murphy, and then Rutledge were the first justices to agree with [[Hugo Black]]'s notion that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] incorporated the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] protection into it; this view would later mostly become law, during the period of the Warren Court.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ball|2006|pp=212–213}}</ref> For his part, Frankfurter would assert that Black's incorporation theory would usurp state control over criminal justice by limiting states' development of new interpretations of criminal due process.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ball|2006|p=213}}</ref>

Frankfurter's argumentative style was not popular among his Supreme Court colleagues. "All Frankfurter does is talk, talk, talk," Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] complained. "He drives you crazy."<ref name =I328>{{Harvnb|Irons|1999|p=328}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Parrish|1996|p=52}}</ref> [[Hugo Black]] reported that "I thought Felix was going to hit me today, he got so mad."<ref name =I328/> In the Court's biweekly conference sessions, traditionally a period for vote-counting, Frankfurter had the habit of lecturing his colleagues for forty-five minutes at a time or more with his book resting on a podium. Frankfurter's ideological opponents would leave the room or read their mail while he lectured.<ref>Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior. Oxford University Press. 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-507814-4}}. Page 140.</ref>

Frankfurter was close friends with Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]].<ref name="H187" /> The two exchanged much correspondence over their mutual dislike for Justice [[William O. Douglas]].<ref name=H187>{{Harvnb|Hirsch|1981|p=187}}</ref>  Frankfurter also had a strong influence over Jackson's opinions.<ref name=H1878>{{Harvnb|Hirsch|1981|pp=187–88}}</ref>

Frankfurter was universally praised for his work before coming to the Supreme Court, and was expected to influence it for decades past the death of FDR.<ref name="wrightsman">{{Citation|last1=Wrightsman|first1=Lawrence S.|last2=La Mort|first2=Justin R.|date=Fall 2005|title=Why Do Supreme Court Justices Succeed or Fail? Harry Blackmun as an Example|journal=Missouri Law Review|volume=70|issue=4|pages=1261–87|url=http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/docs/70-4/Wrightsman.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215004515/http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/docs/70-4/Wrightsman.pdf|archive-date=February 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  However, Frankfurter's influence over other justices was limited by his failure to adapt to new surroundings, his style of personal relations (relying heavily on the use of flattery and ingratiation, which ultimately proved divisive), and his strict adherence to the ideology of [[judicial restraint]]. Michael E. Parrish, professor at UCSD, said of Frankfurter: "History has not been kind to [him]... there is now almost a universal consensus that Frankfurter the justice was a failure, a judge who... became 'uncoupled from the locomotive of history' during the Second World War, and who thereafter left little in the way of an enduring jurisprudential legacy."<ref>Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior. Oxford University Press. 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-507814-4}}. Page 137.</ref>

==Retirement, death==
Frankfurter retired in 1962 after suffering a stroke and was succeeded by [[Arthur Goldberg]].<ref name= jseat /> He was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1963.

Felix Frankfurter died from [[congestive heart failure]] in 1965 at the age of 82. His remains are interred in the [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite book| url= http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html| via= supremecourthistory.org| last= Christensen| first= George A. | year= 1983| title= Here Lies the Supreme Court: Gravesites of the Justices| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050903032026/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html |archive-date=September 3, 2005| publisher= [[Supreme Court Historical Society]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last= Christensen| first=George A.| title= Here Lies the Supreme Court: Revisited| journal= Journal of Supreme Court History| volume= 33 | number= 1| pages= 17–41 |date= February 19, 2008| publisher= [[University of Alabama]]| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5818.2008.00177.x}}</ref>

==Legacy==

There are two extensive collections of Frankfurter's papers: one at the Manuscript Division of the [[Library of Congress]] and the other at Harvard University. Both are fully open for research and have been distributed to other libraries on microfilm. However, in 1972 it was discovered that more than a thousand pages of his archives, including his correspondence with [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and others, had been stolen from the Library of Congress; the crime remains unsolved and the perpetrator and motive are unknown.<ref>Jill Lepore, "The Great Paper Caper", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', December 1, 2014, pp. 32-38.</ref>

A chapter of the international youth-led fraternal organization for Jewish teenagers [[Aleph Zadik Aleph]] in Scottsdale, Arizona, is named in his honor.

A chapter of the international legal fraternal organization [[Phi Alpha Delta]] at [[Suffolk University]] in Boston, Massachusetts, is named in his honor.

==Works==
Frankfurter published several books including ''Cases Under the Interstate Commerce Act''; ''[[The Business of the Supreme Court]]'' (1927); ''Justice Holmes and the Supreme Court'' (1938); ''The Case of Sacco and Vanzetti'' (1927) and ''Felix Frankfurter Reminisces'' (1960).
