==Rule changes==
The [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] announced new rule changes for the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards. These new rules are:

* All voters eligible for a category's nominations are now eligible to vote in that category, providing that they have seen the submitted material and attest to no specific conflicts of interest.
* The number of nominees in the Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Comedy Series categories will expand from six nominees to seven, due to the increase in series production.
* To clarify the difference between a Comedy series and a Drama series, any show where episodes average a length of 30 minutes is eligible to enter as a comedy and series with episodes that average a length of 1 hour is eligible as a drama. There may be exceptions to the rules, however: producers may formally petition to a new Academy panel to have the show be considered for the alternative category. This panel, consisting of five industry leaders appointed by the Academy Chairman and four appointees from the Board of Governors, will vote on a decision. A two-thirds vote was required for the show to be considered for the alternative category. So far, three petitions have been successful: ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', ''[[Jane the Virgin]]'', and ''[[Shameless (U.S. TV series)|Shameless]]'' were voted as eligible for "Outstanding Comedy Series".
* The Outstanding Miniseries was renamed as "Outstanding Limited Series". A "Limited Series" is defined as a program consisting of two or more episodes totaling 150 minutes as a whole, tell a complete, non-recurring story, and do not have an ongoing storyline and/or main characters in subsequent seasons.
* A "Guest Actor" is now defined as a performer appearing in less than 50% of the program's episodes. Only performers that fit this criteria are allowed to submit.
* The Outstanding Variety Series category has been split into two separate categories: "Outstanding Variety Talk" and "Outstanding Variety Sketch".
