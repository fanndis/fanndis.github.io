[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma''' (born '''Prince Louis of Battenberg'''; 25 June 1900 – 27 August 1979), was a British [[Royal Navy]] officer and statesman, an uncle of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], and second cousin once removed of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. During the [[Second World War]], he was [[Supreme Allied Commander]], [[South East Asia Command]]. He was the last [[Viceroy of India]] and the first [[governor-general]] of [[Dominion of India|independent India]].

Born in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] to a [[Battenberg family|prominent aristocratic family]], Mountbatten attended the [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]] before entering the Royal Navy in 1916. He saw action during the closing phase of the [[First World War]], and after the war briefly attended [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. During the interwar period, Mountbatten continued to pursue his naval career, specialising in naval communications.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Mountbatten commanded the destroyer [[HMS Kelly (F01)|HMS ''Kelly'']] and the [[5th Destroyer Flotilla]] and saw considerable action in Norway, the English Channel and the Mediterranean. In August 1941, he received command of the aircraft carrier [[HMS Illustrious (87)|HMS ''Illustrious'']]. He was appointed chief of [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Combined Operations]] and a member of the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] in early 1942, and organised the raids on [[St Nazaire Raid|St Nazaire]] and [[Dieppe Raid|Dieppe]]. In August 1943, Mountbatten became Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command and oversaw the recapture of [[Burma campaign 1944–45|Burma]] and [[Operation Tiderace|Singapore]] from the Japanese by the end of 1945. For his service during the war, Mountbatten was created viscount in 1946 and earl the following year.

In March 1947, Mountbatten was appointed Viceroy of India and oversaw the [[Partition of India|Partition of British India]] into [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. He then served as the first Governor-General of India until June 1948. In 1952, Mountbatten was appointed commander-in-chief of the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] and [[NATO]] Commander [[Allied Forces Mediterranean]]. From 1954 to 1959, he was [[First Sea Lord]], a position that had been held by his father, [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]], some forty years earlier. Thereafter he served as [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|chief of the Defence Staff]] until 1965, making him the longest-serving professional head of the British Armed Forces to date. During this period Mountbatten also served as [[chairman of the NATO Military Committee]] for a year.

In August 1979, Mountbatten was assassinated by a bomb planted aboard his fishing boat in [[Mullaghmore, County Sligo]], Ireland, by members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. He received a ceremonial funeral at [[Westminster Abbey]] and was buried in [[Romsey Abbey]].

== Early life ==
[[File:Mountbatten familia.jpg|left|thumbnail|Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, Prince Louis of Battenberg and their four children Princess Alice, Princess Louise, Prince George and Prince Louis.]]
Prince Louis of [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] was born on 25 June 1900 at [[Frogmore House]] in the [[Home Park, Windsor|Home Park]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[Berkshire]]. He was the youngest child and the second son of [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] and his wife [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]]. His maternal grandparents were [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]], and [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], who was a daughter of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. His paternal grandparents were [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine (1823–1888)|Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]] and [[Julia, Princess of Battenberg]].<ref name=burke>{{harvp|Montgomery-Massingberd|1973|pp=303–304}}</ref> His paternal grandparents' marriage was [[morganatic]] because his grandmother was not of royal lineage; as a result, he and his father were styled "Serene Highness" rather than "Grand Ducal Highness", were not eligible to be titled Princes of Hesse and were given the less exalted Battenberg title. His elder siblings were [[Princess Alice of Battenberg|Princess Alice of Greece and Denmark]] (mother of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]), Princess Louise of Battenberg (later [[Louise Mountbatten|Queen Louise of Sweden]]), and Prince George of Battenberg (later [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven]]).<ref name="burke" />

He was baptised in the large drawing room of Frogmore House on 17 July 1900 by the [[Dean of Windsor]], [[Philip Eliot (priest)|Philip Eliot]]. His godparents were Queen Victoria, Nicholas II of Russia (represented by the child's father) and [[Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg]] (represented by [[Lord Edward Clinton]]).<ref name="journal">{{cite web |url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/search/displayItemFromId.do?FormatType=fulltextimgsrc&QueryType=articles&ItemID=19000717 |title=Journal Entry : Tuesday 17th July 1900 |author=Queen Victoria |date=17 July 1900 |website=queenvictoriasjournals.org |publisher= |access-date=5 August 2019 |quote=|author-link=Queen Victoria }}</ref> He wore the original 1841 [[royal christening gown]] at the ceremony.<ref name="journal" />

Mountbatten's nickname among family and friends was "Dickie", although "Richard" was not among his given names. This was because his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had suggested the nickname of "Nicky", but to avoid confusion with the many Nickys of the Russian Imperial Family ("Nicky" was particularly used to refer to [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], the last Tsar), "Nicky" was changed to "Dickie".{{r|life1942081763}}

Prince Louis was educated at home for the first 10 years of his life; he was then sent to [[Lockers Park School]] in [[Hertfordshire]]<ref name="odnb">{{harvp|Ziegler |2011}}.</ref> and on to the [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]] in May 1913.<ref name="heath183">{{harvp|Heathcote|2002|p=183}}.</ref> His mother's younger sister was [[Russian Empire|Russian]] Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]]. In childhood he visited the Imperial Court of Russia at [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]] and became intimate with the [[House of Romanov|Russian Imperial Family]], harbouring romantic feelings towards his maternal first cousin [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899–1918)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna]], whose photograph he kept at his bedside for the rest of his life.<ref name="king49">{{harvp|King|Wilson|2003|p=49}}.</ref>

From 1914 to 1918, [[Allies of World War I|Britain and its allies]] were at [[World War I|war]] with the [[Central Powers]], led by the [[German Empire]]. To appease British nationalist sentiment, [[George V|King George V]] issued a royal proclamation changing the name of the British [[royal house]] from the German [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] to the [[House of Windsor]]. The king's British relatives followed suit with Prince Louis's father dropping his German titles and name and adopting the surname Mountbatten, an anglicization of Battenberg. His father was subsequently created Marquess of Milford Haven.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Mountbatten was posted as [[midshipman]] to the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}} in July 1916 and, after seeing action in August 1916, transferred to the battleship {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} during the closing phases of the [[First World War]].<ref name=heath183/> In June 1917, when the royal family stopped using their German names and titles and adopted the more British-sounding "Windsor", [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] became Louis Mountbatten and was created [[Marquess of Milford Haven]]. His second son acquired the [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] ''Lord Louis Mountbatten'' and was known as ''Lord Louis'' until he was created a peer in 1946.<ref name=heath184>{{harvp|Heathcote|2002|p=184}}.</ref> He paid a visit of ten days to the Western Front, in July 1918.<ref>Ziegler 1986, p46</ref>

[[File:Lord Louis Mountbatten1925.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait by [[Philip de László]], 1925]]
He was appointed [[executive officer]] (second-in-command) of the [[P-class sloop|small warship]] HMS&nbsp;P.&nbsp;31 on 13 October 1918 and was promoted [[sub-lieutenant]] on 15 January 1919. HMS&nbsp;P.&nbsp;31 took part in the Peace River Pageant on 4 April 1919. Mountbatten attended [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] for two terms, starting in October 1919, where he studied English literature (including [[John Milton]] and [[Lord Byron]]) in a programme designed to augment the education of junior officers which had been curtailed by the war.<ref>Ziegler 1986, p&nbsp;47–49</ref><ref>Smith 2010, p66</ref> He was elected for a term to the Standing Committee of the [[Cambridge Union Society]] and was suspected of sympathy for the Labour Party, then emerging as a potential party of government for the first time.<ref>Ziegler 1985, p&nbsp;49</ref>

He was posted to the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}} in March 1920 and accompanied [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], on a royal tour of Australia in her.<ref name=heath184/> He was promoted [[lieutenant]] on 15 April 1920.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32461 |date=20 September 1921 |page=7384}}</ref> HMS&nbsp;''Renown'' returned to Portsmouth on 11 October 1920.<ref name="Ziegler 1986, p59">Ziegler 1986, p59</ref> Early in 1921 Royal Navy personnel were used for civil defence duties as [[Triple Alliance (1914)#The Post-War Triple Alliance|serious industrial unrest]] seemed imminent.

Fifty-two percent of the officers of his year had had to leave the Royal Navy by the end of 1923; although he was highly regarded by his superiors, it was rumoured that wealthy and well-connected officers were more likely to be retained.<ref>Ziegler 1986, p&nbsp;73</ref> He was posted to the battleship {{HMS|Revenge|06|6}} in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in January 1923.<ref name=heath184/>

Pursuing his interests in technological development and gadgetry, Mountbatten joined the Portsmouth Signals School in August 1924 and then went on briefly to study electronics at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]].<ref name=heath184/> Mountbatten became a Member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers ([[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]]), now the Institution of Engineering and Technology ([[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]]), which annually awards the Mountbatten Medal for an outstanding contribution, or contributions over a period, to the promotion of electronics or information technology and their application.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conferences.theiet.org/achievement/senior/mountbatten.cfm |title=Mountbatten Medal |publisher=IET |accessdate=20 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027032009/http://conferences.theiet.org/achievement/senior/mountbatten.cfm |archivedate=27 October 2012 }}</ref> He was posted to the battleship {{HMS|Centurion|1911|6}} in the [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|Reserve Fleet]] in 1926 and became Assistant Fleet Wireless and Signals Officer of the Mediterranean Fleet under the command of Admiral [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Sir Roger Keyes]] in January 1927.<ref name=heath184/> Promoted [[lieutenant-commander]] on 15 April 1928,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33378|date=24 April 1928|page=2900}}</ref> he returned to the Signals School in July 1929 as Senior Wireless Instructor.<ref name=heath184/> He was appointed Fleet Wireless Officer to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in August 1931 and, having been promoted [[commander]] on 31 December 1932,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33899 |date=3 January 1933 |page=48}}</ref> was posted to the battleship {{HMS|Resolution|09|6}}.<ref name=heath184/>

In 1934, Mountbatten was appointed to his first command – the destroyer {{HMS|Daring|H16|6}}.<ref name=heath184/> His ship was a new destroyer, which he was to sail to [[Singapore]] and exchange for an older ship, {{HMS|Wishart|D67|6}}.<ref name=heath184/> He successfully brought ''Wishart'' back to port in [[Malta]] and then attended the funeral of [[King George V]] in January 1936.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34279 |date=29 April 1936 |page=2785 |supp=y}}</ref> Mountbatten was appointed a personal naval [[aide-de-camp]] to [[King Edward VIII]] on 23 June 1936<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34296 |date=19 June 1936 |page=4012 |supp=y}}</ref> and, having joined the Naval Air Division of the [[Admiralty]] in July 1936,<ref name="Zuckerman">{{harvp|Zuckerman|1981|pp=354–366}}</ref> he attended the [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]] in May 1937.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34453|date=10 November 1937|page=7049 |supp=y}}</ref> He was promoted [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] on 30 June 1937<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34414 |date=2 July 1937 |page=4247}}</ref> and was then given command of the destroyer {{HMS|Kelly|F01|6}} in June 1939.<ref name=heath185>{{harvp|Heathcote|2002|p=185}}.</ref>

In July 1939, Mountbatten was granted a patent (UK Number 508,956) for a system for maintaining a warship in a fixed position relative to another ship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wikipatents.com/gb/508956.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105155508/http://www.wikipatents.com/gb/508956.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=5 January 2013 |title=Abstract of GB508956 508,956.

=== Second World War ===
[[File:Admiral of the Fleet Earl Mountbatten of Burma H17387.jpg|thumb|Mountbatten inspecting sailors before the Bruneval raid, February 1942]]
When war broke out in September 1939, Mountbatten became Captain (D) (commander) of the [[5th Destroyer Flotilla]] aboard HMS ''Kelly'', which became famous for its exploits.<ref name="Zuckerman"/> In late 1939 he brought [[Edward VIII|the Duke of Windsor]] back from exile in France and in early May 1940 Mountbatten led a British convoy in through the fog to evacuate the Allied forces participating in the [[Namsos Campaign]] during the [[Norwegian Campaign]].<ref name=heath185/>

On the night of 9–10 May 1940, ''Kelly'' was torpedoed amidships by a German [[E-boat]] ''S&nbsp;31'' off the Dutch coast, and Mountbatten thereafter commanded the 5th Destroyer Flotilla from the destroyer {{HMS|Javelin|F61|6}}.<ref name=heath185/> On 29 November 1940 the 5th Flotilla engaged three German destroyers off [[Lizard Point, Cornwall]]. Mountbatten turned to port to match a German course change. This was "a rather disastrous move as the [[Director (military)#For warships|directors]] swung off and lost target"<ref>March, p. 353</ref> and it resulted in ''Javelin'' being struck by two torpedoes. He rejoined ''Kelly'' in December 1940, by which time the torpedo damage had been repaired.<ref name=heath185/>

''Kelly'' was sunk by German [[dive bomber]]s on 23 May 1941 during the [[Battle of Crete]];<ref name=heath186>{{harvp|Heathcote|2002|p=186}}</ref> the incident serving as the basis for [[Noël Coward]]'s film ''[[In Which We Serve]]''.<ref>{{harvp|Niemi|2006|p= 70}}.</ref> Coward was a personal friend of Mountbatten and copied some of his speeches into the film.<ref name=heath186/> Mountbatten was [[mentioned in despatches]] on 9 August 1940<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34918 |date=9 August 1940 |page=4919 |supp=y}}</ref> and 21 March 1941<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35113 |date=18 March 1941 |page=1654 |supp=y}}</ref> and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in January 1941.<ref name=dso/>

[[File:Mountbatten Short and Kimmel in Hawaii 1941.jpg|left|thumb|[[Walter Short]], Mountbatten and [[Husband E. Kimmel]] in [[Hawaii]] 1941]]

In August 1941, Mountbatten was appointed captain of the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} which lay in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], for repairs following [[Operation Pedestal|action at Malta]] in January.<ref name=heath186/> During this period of relative inactivity, he paid a flying visit to [[Pearl Harbor]], three months before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on it]]. Mountbatten, appalled at the US naval base's lack of preparedness, drawing on Japan's history of launching wars with surprise attacks as well as the successful British surprise attack at the [[Battle of Taranto]] which had effectively knocked Italy's fleet out of the war, and the sheer effectiveness of aircraft against warships, accurately predicted that the US would enter the war after a Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.<ref name=heath186/><ref>{{cite web |last=O'Toole |first=Thomas |url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1982/12/07/mountbatten-predicted-pearl-harbor/26546444-b456-47aa-af05-c6aa97e884fd/ |title=Mountbatten Predicted Pearl Harbor |work=The Washington Post |date=7 December 1982 |accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref>

Mountbatten was a favourite of [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Gilbert, Martin |author-link = Martin Gilbert |title=Winston S. Churchill: Never Despair: 1945–1965 |year=1988 |page=762}}</ref> On 27 October 1941 Mountbatten replaced [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Roger Keyes]] as Chief of [[Combined Operations Headquarters]] and was promoted to [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]].<ref name=heath186/>

His duties in this role included inventing new technical aids to assist with opposed landings.<ref name="Zuckerman"/> Noteworthy technical achievements of Mountbatten and his staff include the construction of [[Operation Pluto|"PLUTO", an underwater oil pipeline to Normandy]], an artificial [[Mulberry harbour]] constructed of concrete caissons and sunken ships, and the development of [[Landing Ship, Tank|tank-landing ships]].<ref name="Zuckerman"/> Another project Mountbatten proposed to Churchill was [[Project Habakkuk]]. It was to be an unsinkable 600-metre aircraft carrier made from reinforced ice ("[[Pykrete]]"): Habakkuk was never carried out due to its enormous cost.<ref name="Zuckerman"/>

[[File:Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, 1943. TR1230 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mountbatten in 1943]]
As commander of Combined Operations, Mountbatten and his staff planned the highly successful [[Operation Biting|Bruneval raid]], which gained important information and captured part of a German [[Würzburg radar]] installation and one of the machine's technicians on 27 February 1942. It was Mountbatten who recognised that surprise and speed were essential to capture the radar, and saw that an airborne assault was the only viable method.{{sfn|Otway|1990|pp=65–66}}

On 18 March 1942, he was promoted to the [[acting rank]] of [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|vice admiral]] and given the [[honorary rank]]s of [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant general]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/transcripts/service_records/navalofficer_sr.htm |title=First World War |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2020-01-14}}</ref> and [[air marshal]] to have the authority to carry out his duties in Combined Operations; and was placed in the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAmqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA53|title=Art of Generalship|first=K.

After these two successes came the [[Dieppe Raid]] of 19 August 1942. He was central in the planning and promotion of the raid on the port of Dieppe. The raid was a marked failure, with casualties of almost 60%, the great majority of them Canadians.<ref name=heath186/> Following the Dieppe raid Mountbatten became a controversial figure in Canada, with the [[Royal Canadian Legion]] distancing itself from him during his visits there during his later career.<ref name=villa>{{harvp|Villa|1989|pp=240–241}}.</ref> His relations with Canadian veterans, who blamed him for the losses, "remained frosty" after the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-71-2359-13811/conflict_war/dieppe/clip6 |title=Who Was Responsible For Dieppe? |publisher=CBC Archives |date=9 September 1962 |accessdate= 1 August 2007}}</ref>

Mountbatten claimed that the lessons learned from the Dieppe Raid were necessary for planning the Normandy invasion on [[D-Day]] nearly two years later. However, military historians such as former Royal Marine [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]] have written that these lessons should not have needed a debacle such as Dieppe to be recognised.<ref name=Thompson>{{harvp|Thompson|2001|p=263–269}}.</ref> Nevertheless, as a direct result of the failings of the Dieppe raid, the British made several innovations, most notably [[Hobart's Funnies]] – specialised armoured vehicles which, in the course of the [[Normandy Landings]], undoubtedly saved many lives on those three beachheads upon which Commonwealth soldiers were landing ([[Gold Beach]], [[Juno Beach]] and [[Sword Beach]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/04/uk_d_day_inventions/html/1.stm |title=In pictures: D-Day inventions: The Flail |work=BBC News|accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref>

British interpreter [[Hugh Lunghi]] recounted an embarrassing episode during the [[Potsdam Conference]] when Mountbatten, desiring to receive an invitation to visit the [[Soviet Union]], repeatedly attempted to impress [[Joseph Stalin]] with his former connections to the [[House of Romanov|Russian imperial family]].

Mountbatten concluded that the situation was too volatile to wait even a year before granting independence to India.

Mountbatten was fond of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and his liberal outlook for the country.

Among the Indian leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] emphatically insisted on maintaining a united India and for a while successfully rallied people to this goal. During his meeting with Mountbatten, Gandhi asked Mountbatten to invite Jinnah to form a new central government, but Mountbatten never uttered a word of Gandhi's ideas to Jinnah.<ref>{{harvp|Wolpert|2006|p=139}}.</ref> When Mountbatten's timeline offered the prospect of attaining independence soon, sentiments took a different turn. Given Mountbatten's determination, Nehru and Patel's inability to deal with the Muslim League and, lastly, Jinnah's obstinacy, all Indian party leaders (except Gandhi) acquiesced to Jinnah's plan to divide India,<ref name=Ziegler373>{{harvp|Ziegler|1985|p=373}}.</ref> which in turn eased Mountbatten's task. Mountbatten also developed a strong relationship with the Indian princes, who ruled those portions of India not directly under British rule.

In the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, Mountbatten strongly advised his old friend Prime Minister Anthony Eden against the Conservative government's plans to seize the Suez canal in conjunction with France and Israel. He argued that such a move would destabilize the Middle East, undermine the authority of the United Nations, divide the Commonwealth and diminish Britain's global standing. His advice was not taken.

Military commanders did not understand the physics involved in a nuclear explosion.

[[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]], in his 1987 book ''[[Spycatcher]]'', claimed that in May 1968 Mountbatten attended a private meeting with press baron [[Cecil Harmsworth King|Cecil King]], and the government's Chief Scientific Adviser, [[Solly Zuckerman]]. Wright alleged that "up to thirty" [[MI5]] officers had joined a secret campaign to undermine the crisis-stricken Labour government of [[Harold Wilson]] and that King was an MI5 agent. In the meeting, King allegedly urged Mountbatten to become the leader of a government of national salvation. Solly Zuckerman pointed out that it was "rank treachery" and the idea came to nothing because of Mountbatten's reluctance to act.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo950110/debtext/60110-43.htm |title=House of Commons Proceedings |at=Column 287 |website=Hansard |date=10 January 1996 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> In contrast, [[Andrew Lownie]] has suggested that it took the intervention of the Queen to dissuade him from plotting against Wilson.<ref name="Sawer">{{cite news |last1=Sawer |first1=Patrick |title=Revealed: Full extent of Lord Mountbatten's role in '68 plot against Harold Wilson |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/17/revealed-full-extent-lord-mountbattens-role-68-plot-against/ |work=The Sunday Times |date=17 August 2019}}</ref>

In 2006, the BBC documentary ''The Plot Against Harold Wilson'' alleged that there had been another plot involving Mountbatten to oust Wilson during his second term in office (1974–1976). The period was characterised by high inflation, increasing unemployment and widespread industrial unrest. The alleged plot revolved around [[right-wing]] former military figures who were supposedly building private armies to counter the perceived threat from [[trade union]]s and the Soviet Union. They believed that the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which was (and {{as of|April 2016|alt=still is}}) partly funded by [[affiliated trade union]]s, was unable and unwilling to counter these developments and that Wilson was either a Soviet agent or at the very least a [[Communism|Communist]] sympathiser&nbsp;– claims Wilson strongly denied. The documentary alleged that a coup was planned to overthrow Wilson and replace him with Mountbatten using the private armies and sympathisers in the military and MI5.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4789060.stm |work=BBC News|title= Wilson 'Plot': The Secret Tapes |date=9 March 2006 |accessdate=20 September 2012 |first=Brian |last=Wheeler}}</ref>

The first official history of MI5, ''[[The Defence of the Realm]]'' (2009), implied that there was a plot against Wilson and that MI5 did have a file on him. Yet it also made clear that the plot was in no way official and that any activity centred on a small group of discontented officers. This much had already been confirmed by former [[cabinet secretary]] [[John Hunt, Baron Hunt of Tanworth|Lord Hunt]], who concluded in a secret inquiry conducted in 1996 that "there is absolutely no doubt at all that a few, a very few, malcontents in MI5 ... a lot of them like Peter Wright who were right-wing, malicious and had serious personal grudges – gave vent to these and spread damaging malicious stories about that Labour government."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/10/defence-of-the-realm-mi5 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |title=The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5 by Christopher Andrew |first=David |last=Leigh |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage ===
[[File:Louis and Edwina Mountbatten 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louis and Edwina Mountbatten]]

Mountbatten was married on 18 July 1922 to [[Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Edwina Cynthia Annette Ashley]], daughter of [[Wilfrid Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple|Wilfred William Ashley]], later 1st&nbsp;[[Baron Mount Temple]], himself a grandson of the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|7th&nbsp;Earl of Shaftesbury]]. She was the favourite granddaughter of the Edwardian magnate [[Ernest Cassel|Sir Ernest Cassel]] and the principal heir to his fortune.  The couple spent heavily on households, luxuries and entertainment.<ref name=heath184/> There followed a honeymoon tour of European royal courts and America which included a visit to [[Niagara Falls]] (because "all honeymooners went there").<ref name="life1942081763">{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v04EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA63 |title=Lord Louis Mountbatten |work=Life |date=17 August 1942 |accessdate=20 September 2012 |page=63 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>

====Allegations of sexual abuse====
The FBI file on Mountbatten, begun after he took on the role of Supreme Allied Commander in Southeast Asia in 1944, contains a claim by American author [[Elizabeth Wharton Drexel]] that Mountbatten had "a perversion for young boys".<ref name="thetimes"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/lord-mountbatten-pedophile-allegations|title=FBI files allege Lord Mountbatten, murdered by the IRA, was a pedophile|date=20 August 2019|publisher=Irish Central|accessdate=17 May 2020}}</ref> Norman Nield, Mountbatten's driver from 1942–1943, told the tabloid ''[[New Zealand Truth]]'' that he transported young boys aged 8 to 12 and was paid to keep quiet.

=== Daughter as heir ===
Lord and Lady Mountbatten had two daughters: [[Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma]] (14 February 1924 – 13 June 2017),<ref>{{cite news |last1=Corby |first1=Tom |title=Countess Mountbatten of Burma |department=obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/15/countess-mountbatten-of-burma-obituary |work=The Guardian |date=15 June 2017}}</ref> sometime lady-in-waiting to [[Queen Elizabeth II]], and [[Lady Pamela Hicks]] (born 19 April 1929), who accompanied them to India in 1947–1948 and was also sometime lady-in-waiting to the Queen.<ref name=burke/>

Since Mountbatten had no sons when he was created ''Viscount Mountbatten of Burma, of Romsey in the County of Southampton'' on 27 August 1946<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37702 |date=27 August 1946|page=4305}}</ref> and then ''Earl Mountbatten of Burma'' and ''Baron Romsey, in the County of Southampton'' on 28 October 1947,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38109 |date=28 October 1947 |page=5074}}</ref> the [[Letters Patent]] were drafted such that in the event he left no sons or issue in the male line, the titles could pass to his daughters, in order of seniority of birth, and to their male heirs respectively.<ref name="auto"/>

=== Leisure interests ===
Like many members of the royal family, Mountbatten was an aficionado of polo. He received US patent 1,993,334 in 1931 for a polo stick.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1993334.html |title=Polo Stick: United States Patent 1993334 |accessdate=20 September 2012 |via=Free Patents on Line}}</ref> Mountbatten introduced the sport to the Royal Navy in the 1920s and wrote a book on the subject.{{r|life1942081763}} He also served as Commodore of Emsworth Sailing Club in [[Hampshire]] from 1931.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservancy.co.uk/assets/assets/walks_ems_lang.pdf |title=Emsworth to Langstone |accessdate=19 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922184900/http://www.conservancy.co.uk/assets/assets/walks_ems_lang.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> He was a long-serving Patron of the [[Society for Nautical Research]] (1951–1979).<ref>Hugh Murphy & Derek J. Oddy (2010) ''The Mirror of the Seas: A Centenary History of the Society for Nautical Research'', London, Society for Nautical Research, p.191. {{ISBN|978-0-902387-010}}</ref>

=== Mentorship of the Prince of Wales ===
Mountbatten was a strong influence in the upbringing of his grand-nephew, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and later as a mentor – "Honorary Grandfather" and "Honorary Grandson", they fondly called each other according to the [[Jonathan Dimbleby]] biography of the Prince – though according to both the Ziegler biography of Mountbatten and the Dimbleby biography of the Prince, the results may have been mixed. He from time to time strongly upbraided the Prince for showing tendencies towards the idle pleasure-seeking dilettantism of his predecessor as Prince of Wales, [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]], whom Mountbatten had known well in their youth. Yet he also encouraged the Prince to enjoy the bachelor life while he could, and then to marry a young and inexperienced girl so as to ensure a stable married life.<ref>{{harvp|Junor|2005|p=72}}.</ref>

Mountbatten's qualification for offering advice to this particular heir to the throne was unique; it was he who had arranged the visit of [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] to [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth Royal Naval College]] on 22 July 1939, taking care to include the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret in the invitation, but assigning his nephew, [[Cadet]] [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip of Greece]], to keep them amused while their parents toured the facility. This was the first recorded meeting of Charles's future parents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/R/real_lives/prince_philip.html |title=The Real Prince Philip| accessdate =12 May 2007 |last=Edwards |first=Phil |date=31 October 2000 |format=TV documentary |website=Real Lives: Channel 4's portrait gallery |publisher=Channel 4}}</ref> But a few months later, Mountbatten's efforts nearly came to naught when he received a letter from his sister Alice in [[Athens]] informing him that Philip was visiting her and had agreed to permanently [[repatriation|repatriate]] to Greece. Within days, Philip received a command from his cousin and sovereign, King [[George II of Greece]], to resume his naval career in Britain which, though given without explanation, the young prince obeyed.<ref>{{harvp|Vickers|2000|p=281}}.</ref>

In 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with Charles about a potential marriage to his granddaughter, [[Amanda Ellingworth|Hon.&nbsp;Amanda Knatchbull]].<ref name="Dimbleby204–206">{{harvp|Dimbleby|1994|pp=204–206}}.</ref> It was about this time he also recommended that the 25&nbsp;year-old prince get on with "sowing some wild oats".<ref name="Dimbleby204–206"/> Charles dutifully wrote to Amanda's mother (who was also his godmother), [[Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Lady Brabourne]], about his interest. Her answer was supportive, but advised him that she thought her daughter still rather young to be [[courtship|courted]].<ref name=JD>{{harvp|Dimbleby|1994|pp=263–265}}.</ref>

In February 1975, Charles visited [[New Delhi]] to play [[polo]] and was shown around [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]], the former Viceroy's House, by Mountbatten.<ref>{{cite news | title = People in Sports | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/22/archives/people-in-sports-bench-and-model-married-in-ohio.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 22 February 1975 | accessdate = 17 November 2020}}</ref>

Four years later Mountbatten secured an invitation for himself and Amanda to accompany Charles on his planned 1980 tour of India.<ref name=JD/> Their fathers promptly objected. Prince Philip thought that the Indian public's reception would more likely reflect response to the uncle than to the nephew. [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|Lord Brabourne]] counselled that the intense scrutiny of the press would be more likely to drive Mountbatten's godson and granddaughter apart than together.<ref name=JD/>

Charles was rescheduled to tour India alone, but Mountbatten did not live to the planned date of departure. When Charles finally did propose marriage to Amanda later in 1979, the circumstances were changed and she refused him.<ref name=JD/>

== Television appearances ==
On 27 April 1977, shortly before his 77th&nbsp;birthday, Mountbatten became the first member of the Royal Family to appear on the TV guest show ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eofftv.com/t/thi/this_is_your_life_1969_main.htm |title=This Is Your Life (1969–1993) |publisher=EOFF TV |accessdate=20 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422082302/http://www.eofftv.com/t/thi/this_is_your_life_1969_main.htm |archivedate=22 April 2012 }}</ref>

Mountbatten usually holidayed at his summer home, [[Classiebawn Castle]], in [[Mullaghmore, County Sligo|Mullaghmore]], a small seaside village in [[County Sligo]] in the north-west of [[Ireland]]. The village was only {{convert|12|mi}} from [[Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland border|the border]] with [[County Fermanagh]] in [[Northern Ireland]] and near an area known to be used as a cross-border refuge by [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] members.<ref name="Time Magazine">{{Cite news |title=Britain: A Nation Mourns Its Loss |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920606,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=10 September 1979 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=onthisday /> In 1978, the IRA had allegedly attempted to shoot Mountbatten as he was aboard his boat, but poor weather had prevented the sniper taking his shot.<ref>{{cite book |author=Barratt, John |title=With the greatest respect: The private lives of Earl Mountbatten and Prince & Princess Michael of Kent |publisher=Sidgwick & Jackson |year=1991 |page=23}}</ref>

On 27 August 1979, Mountbatten went [[lobster trap|lobster-potting]] and tuna fishing in his {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wooden boat, ''Shadow&nbsp;V'', which had been moored in the harbour at Mullaghmore.<ref name=onthisday/> IRA member [[Thomas McMahon (Irish republican)|Thomas McMahon]] had slipped onto the unguarded boat that night and attached a radio-controlled bomb weighing {{convert|50|lb|kg}}.

[[George Colley]], the ''[[Tánaiste]]'' (Deputy Prime Minister) of the [[Republic of Ireland]], said:<blockquote>No effort will be spared to bring those responsible to justice. It is understood that subversives have claimed responsibility for the explosion. Assuming that police investigations substantiate the claim, I know that the Irish people will join me in condemning this heartless and terrible outrage.<ref name=nyt/></blockquote>

The IRA issued a statement afterward, saying:<blockquote>The IRA claim responsibility for the execution of Lord Louis Mountbatten. This operation is one of the discriminate ways we can bring to the attention of the English people the continuing occupation of our country. ... The death of Mountbatten and the tributes paid to him will be seen in sharp contrast to the apathy of the British Government and the English people to the deaths of over three hundred British soldiers, and the deaths of Irish men, women, and children at the hands of their forces.<ref name="Time Magazine"/><ref>{{cite book |author=English, Richard |title=Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA |publisher=Pan Macmillan |year=2004 |page=220}}</ref></blockquote>

Six weeks later,<ref name="time" /> [[Sinn Féin]] vice-president [[Gerry Adams]] said of Mountbatten's death:<blockquote>The IRA gave clear reasons for the execution. I think it is unfortunate that anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical attitude of the media establishment. As a member of the House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country.

=== Aftermath ===
Two hours before the bomb detonated, [[Thomas McMahon (Irish republican)|Thomas McMahon]] had been arrested at a Garda checkpoint between [[Longford]] and [[Granard]] on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle. He was tried for the assassinations in Ireland and convicted on 23 November 1979 based on forensic evidence supplied by [[James O'Donovan]] that showed flecks of paint from the boat and traces of nitroglycerine on his clothes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/5995439/Killer-of-Lord-Mountbatten-enjoys-freedom-30-years-on-from-IRA-murder.html |title=Killer of Lord Mountbatten Enjoys Freedom, 30&nbsp;Years on from IRA Murder |work=The Telegraph |location= London |date=9 August 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> He was released in 1998 under the terms of the [[Good Friday Agreement]].<ref name=onthisday /><ref>{{harvp|Moloney|2002|p=176}}.</ref>

On hearing of Mountbatten's death, the then [[Master of the Queen's Music]], [[Malcolm Williamson]], wrote the ''Lament in Memory of Lord Mountbatten of Burma'' for violin and string orchestra. The 11-minute work was given its first performance on 5 May 1980 by the Scottish Baroque Ensemble, conducted by Leonard Friedman.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/04/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |department=Obituary |title=Malcolm Williamson |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=4 March 2003 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
Mountbatten's faults, according to his biographer [[Philip Ziegler]], like everything else about him, "were on the grandest scale. His vanity though child-like, was monstrous, his ambition unbridled....He sought to rewrite history with cavalier indifference to the facts to magnify his own achievements."<ref>Philip Ziegler, ''Mountbatten'' (1985) p. 701)</ref>  However, Ziegler concludes that Mountbatten's virtues outweighed his defects:
: He was generous and loyal....He was warm-hearted, predisposed to like everyone he met, quick-tempered but never bearing grudges.... His tolerance was extraordinary; his readiness to respect and listen to the views of others was remarkable throughout his life."<ref name="Ziegler, p. 701">Ziegler, p. 701.</ref>

Ziegler argues he was truly a great man, although not profound or original.
: What he could do with superlative aplomb was to identify the object at which he was aiming, and force it through to its conclusion. A powerful, analytic mind of crystalline clarity, a superabundance of energy, great persuasive powers, endless resilience in the face of setback or disaster rendered him the most formidable of operators. He was infinitely resourceful, quick in his reactions, always ready to cut his losses and start again.....He was an executor of policy rather than an initiator; but whatever the policy, he espoused it with such energy and enthusiasm, made it so completely his own, that it became identified with him and, in the eyes of the outside world as well as his own, his creation.<ref name="Ziegler, p. 701"/>

Mountbatten's most controversial legacy came in his support for the burgeoning nationalist movements which grew up in the shadow of Japanese occupation. His priority was to maintain practical, stable government, but driving him was an idealism in which he believed every people should be allowed to control their own destiny. Critics said he was too ready to overlook their faults, and especially their subordination to communist control. Ziegler says that in Malaya, where the main resistance to the Japanese came from Chinese who were under considerable communist influence, "Mountbatten proved to have been naïve in his assessment....He erred, however, not because he was 'soft on Communism'....but from an over-readiness to assume the best of those with whom he had dealings." Furthermore, Ziegler argues, he was following a practical policy based on the assumption that it would take a long and bloody struggle to drive the Japanese out, and he needed the support of all the anti-Japanese elements, most of which were either nationalists or communists.<ref>Ziegler, p 314.</ref>

Mountbatten took pride in enhancing intercultural understanding and in 1984, with his elder daughter as the patron, the [[Mountbatten Institute]] was developed to allow young adults the opportunity to enhance their intercultural appreciation and experience by spending time abroad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mountbatten.org |title=Mountbatten Institute |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref>
