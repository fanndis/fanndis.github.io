''''' Anti''''' (stylized in [[all caps]]) is the eighth [[studio album]] by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. It was released on 28 January 2016 through Westbury Road and [[Roc Nation]]. Rihanna collaborated with producers including [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Boi-1da]], [[DJ Mustard]], [[Hit-Boy]], [[Brian Kennedy (record producer)|Brian Kennedy]], [[Timbaland]] and [[No I.D.]] to achieve her desired sound. The efforts resulted in a departure from Rihanna's previous [[dance music|dance]] and [[club music|club]] music genres and created a primarily [[Pop music|pop]], [[hip hop soul]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] record, with elements of [[dancehall]] and [[Soul music|soul]]. ''Anti'' explores themes of relationship toxicity, betrayal by loved ones, artistic and personal liberation, alongside reconciliation and continued faithfulness.

The album was released to positive reviews from music critics and numerous publications included it on their lists of the best albums of 2016 and the 2010s. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included the album on their [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Best Albums of All Time list]]. It peaked at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], moving 166,000 equivalent-album units in its first full tracking week, and after two days of its release was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) as a result of [[Samsung]] purchasing one million copies of the album in advance. It also topped the charts in Canada, Norway, Taiwan and the [[UK R&B Album Chart]].

It produced four singles, including the single "[[Work (Rihanna song)|Work]]", featuring [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], which peaked at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] becoming Rihanna's fourteenth number one song on the chart, and spending nine weeks a top. To further promote the album, Rihanna embarked on her seventh worldwide concert tour, the [[Anti World Tour]] in 2016. ''Anti'' was the best performing album by a black female artist of the 2010s decade.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums By Women|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-billboard-200-albums-by-women|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

==Background==
Following the release of Rihanna's seventh studio album, ''[[Unapologetic]]'' (2012) and its [[Diamonds World Tour|accompanying tour]], the singer aimed to take a hiatus from recording music. She stated, "I wanted to have a year to just do whatever I want artistically, creatively." However, the hiatus did not last long and after a week she returned to the studio.<ref name=nmeinterview>{{cite web|title=NME interview|url=https://www.nme.com/features/rihanna-exclusive-interview-i-break-the-rules-even-when-i-dont-intend-to|work=[[NME]]|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref> During the initial writing and development of the album, Rihanna wasn't sure how she wanted ''Anti'' to sound. Ultimately, she decided she wanted "honest" music and a body of work that reflected and represented her at that time. Nevertheless, the singer stated that during the recording process she was evolving and she didn't have the answer of who she was at that point. According to her, she was feeling disconnected from her emotions and "numb" during the album's conception.<ref name="vogue">{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13418829/rihanna-vogue-interview-anti-drake-work-puma-fenty/|title=Rihanna vogue interview anti|work=Vogue|last=Aguirre|first=Abby|date=March 24, 2016|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref> During her creative struggle, Rihanna rented a house in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] over a couple of months and started extensively writing and composing music with her team consisting of various musicians.<ref name="instyleref">{{cite web|url=http://www.instyle.com/news/rihanna-gets-real-about-struggles-recording-anti|title=Rihanna Gets Real About Her Struggles Recording ANTI|work=[[InStyle]]|last=Rabideau|first=Camryn|date=January 29, 2017|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref> Reflecting on this Rihanna stated:

{{cquote|It was in that moment that I trusted myself, trusted my ear, trusted my gut, trusted the way that my music made me feel. I had no idea how it would be received, neither was that something I considered. I just wanted to make a body of work that felt right!<ref name="instyleref" />}}

In May 2014, it was announced that Rihanna had left [[Def Jam Recordings]] to sign fully with her manager [[Jay-Z]]'s company [[Roc Nation]], and later revealed she had acquired the masters to all her recordings and would be releasing her eighth studio album jointly through her own record label Westbury Road and Roc Nation.<ref name=label>{{cite news|last=Nostro|first=Lauren|title=Rihanna Has Left Def Jam and Signed to Jay Z's Roc Nation Label|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/05/rihanna-roc-nation-management-label-deal|accessdate=May 5, 2014|newspaper=Complex|date=May 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name="bustle1">{{cite web|title=Westbury Road|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/115184-rihanna-will-release-her-next-album-through-her-own-company-this-feminist-move-is-typical|website=Bustleaccessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref> On February 8, 2015, during his [[57th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Awards]] red carpet interview, American rapper [[Kanye West]] announced that he will be the [[executive producer]] of ''Anti''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|last2=Spanos|first2=Brittany|title=Kanye West, Rihanna, Paul McCartney Debut 'FourFiveSeconds' Live at Grammys|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kanye-west-rihanna-and-paul-mccartney-debut-fourfiveseconds-live-at-grammys-20150208|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=February 8, 2015|date=February 8, 2015}}</ref> However, in January 2016, in a Twitter reply message to a fan, Rihanna wrote that West is no longer executive producer of the album and both of them are working on different projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/rihanna-new-album-kanye-west-no-longer-executive-producing-anti-release-date-remains-unknown-1539225|title=Rihanna new album: Kanye West no longer executive producing Anti as release date remains unknown|work=[[International Business Times]]|last=Adejobi|first=Alicia|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=January 22, 2016}}</ref> Instead, Rihanna herself served as the [[Executive producer#Music|executive producer]] of ''Anti'' and worked with several producers.<ref name="tracklisting" />

==Writing and recording==

The album's recording sessions took place at various studios including, the [[Jungle City Studios]] in New York City, [[Westlake Recording Studios]], Sandra Gale Studios and Windmark Recording Studios in Los Angeles, SOTA Studios in Toronto and Twin Studios in Paris.<ref name="tracklisting" /> Most of the songs were recorded at the Westlake Recording Studios.<ref name="tracklisting" /> Songwriter [[Bibi Bourelly]] had been working with producer, Paperboy Fabe, who arranged a session with West. The result was the song, "[[Higher (Rihanna song)|Higher]]". Later, Rihanna and [[James Fauntleroy]] also contributed to the song writing. "Higher" was recorded in the early morning hours while Rihanna was under the influence of alcohol, "We just said, 'You know what? Let's just drink some whiskey and record this song."<ref name="the interns">{{cite web|url=http://theinterns.net/2015/04/28/6-new-artists-you-need-to-keep-an-eye-on/|title=6 New Artists You Need To Keep An Eye On|publisher=The Interns}}</ref> The song was described by Rihanna as "a drunk voice mail".<ref name="vogue" /> Rihanna and Fauntleroy also collaborated on three other songs – "[[Desperado (Rihanna song)|Desperado]]", "Close to You" and "James Joint". The latter was written with Rihanna and Shea Taylor, who wrote the song in less than 30 minutes, while "Close To You" was written after producer Brian Kennedy sent Fauntleroy a piano music sample.<ref name="genius">{{cite news|last1=Oseran|first1=Anna|title=How to Write a Song for Rihanna|url=https://genius.com/a/how-to-write-a-song-for-rihanna|accessdate=August 23, 2016|work=[[Genius (website)|Genius]]|date=February 26, 2016}}</ref> <!-- The website Genius is not an unreliable source in this case since it's an interview, it was not edited by any user, it's an interview by a journalist with a songwriter, and this part is also crucial for the article. -->

"Desperado" was written by Mick Shultz and Rook Monroe. After visiting Rihanna's home, Shultz was contacted a week later by the singer's team who stated that she really liked the record. Rihanna, Fauntleroy and [[Kuk Harrell]], were all later involved in the song's development, production and recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6859481/rihanna-anti-mick-schultz-desperado|title=Mick Schultz Talks Producing Dark, Edgy Number 'Desperado' for Rihanna's 'Anti'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> In the summer of 2015, songwriter and producer Rupert Thomas together with Allen Ritter and [[Boi-1da]] among others, stayed at Canadian rapper's [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] house in [[Los Angeles]] for several days. During the time, the lead single, "[[Work (Rihanna song)|Work]]" was conceived.<ref name="complexwriting">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/01/producer-sevn-thomas-details-the-process-of-making-rihanna-and-drakes-new-single-work?sr_share=facebook|title=How a Studio Session at Drake's House in Los Angeles Turned Into Rihanna's Next Big Hit|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|last=Frydenlund|first=Zach|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref> Thomas created the beat and played it for Boi-1da to which he positively responded. Boi-1da came with up idea for sampling an "old school dancehall rhythm" and after the chords were made. When the song's music was finished, Boi-1da sent it to [[PartyNextDoor]] who wrote the lyrics.<ref name="complexwriting" />

[[File:Jungle City Studios.jpeg|right|thumbnail|The [[Jungle City Studios]] in New York City served as one of the various recording locations.]]
Two songs each were recorded at [[Jungle City Studios]] in New York City and Windmark Recording Studios in Los Angeles.<ref name="tracklisting" /> The studio sessions at Jungle City produced the opening track "[[Consideration (song)|Consideration]]" and "Kiss It Better". Rihanna stated when recording "Consideration", she felt a connection to it, stating the song captured the sound and attitude she was aiming for.<ref name="vogue" /> The recording sessions at Windmark Recording Studios produced the songs "Never Ending" and "[[Love on the Brain]]". The former was written by Chad Sabo during his time in California, where Sabo was playing with the band Basic Vacation. Sabo was in the band's van and began to write the intro riff that would become "Never Ending". Shortly after, he took the song home and attempted to bring the song together using a digital 8-track studio. He later worked on the song's lyrics and posted it onto the internet. The writing process of "Never Ending" began in November 2013, and started again in April 2014 at which time Rihanna became interested in the track and wanted to record it. English singer-songwriter [[Dido]] co-wrote it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2016/02/chad-sabo-singer-songwriter-interview|title=Meet Chad Sabo, The Roc Nation Singer/Songwriter Behind Rihanna's "Never Ending"|work=[[Complex UK]]}}</ref>

The only song which was recorded outside of the United States was "Same Ol' Mistakes"; the track was recorded at the Twin Studios in Paris<ref name="tracklisting" /> Rihanna's team contacted [[Tame Impala]]'s management and informed them that Rihanna loved the band's song "New Person, Same Old Mistakes" and asked if she could re-record the track for ''Anti''. The song's writer, [[Kevin Parker (musician)|Kevin Parker]], agreed and gave Rihanna permission to record the song. After hearing Rihanna's version, Parker stated, "We're all really happy with how the song turned out, love it!".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/tame-impala/91076#VRH0jSljZkgwMAkG.99|title=Tame Impala's Kevin Parker says he 'loves' Rihanna cover|date=January 29, 2016|work=NME}}</ref>

==Vocal production==
[[File:Kuk Harrell.jpeg|left|thumbnail|upright|American vocal producer [[Kuk Harrell]] did the complete vocal production on ''Anti''.]]

American vocal producer [[Kuk Harrell]], who has been working with Rihanna since 2007, stated that for ''Anti'', Rihanna was creatively more involved in the making process. Harrell stated that she aimed to push the album in the direction she envisioned. The producer stated his attempt to move away from mainstream pop music when producing the album's vocals, "Every record that everybody does is a record that somebody else could've done, if that makes sense. It's so awesome that she just stepped out and was courageous enough to stick to that and be that and do that."<ref name="Harrell">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/thaddis-kuk-harrell-rihanna-beyonce-anti-vocal-producer-interview/Content?oid=21173878|title=Thaddis Kuk Harrell Rihanna Beyonce Anti Vocal Producer|work=Chicago Reader|last=Zaleski|first=Annie|date=February 17, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>

Harrell noted that with the production of ''Anti'' Rihanna was far more meticulous about what she wanted each individual line to sound like. He stated that he attempted to work quickly when producing the album, however Rihanna wanted to constantly improve the album's quality stating "Listen, let's up the quality level. Let's make sure we have the emotion, and make sure it's a masterpiece." Harrell stated that when he and Rihanna had previously worked together they aimed to make a great body of work, however on ''Anti'' they aimed to create a "masterpiece".<ref name="Harrell" /> When discussing his and Rihanna's mindset during the album's production Harrell stated:

<blockquote>Rihanna album [Anti], because it is such a body of work. The whole mind-set. The records that stick out for me the most are when we went into it thinking, "Let's just do great work. Let's not chase radio. We're not trying to get radio hits. We're not trying to make sure that we can have a song that anybody could sing." So that's what Anti is. Let's just do good work, because we love doing what we do, and we get to make music to it.<ref name="Harrell" /></blockquote>

Speaking of the album's production and style, Harrell stated that artists such as Rihanna have been talking a stance and stepping away from the popular music of the time and the expectations of her label, directors and radio, stating, "I don't want to make what everybody else is making. I want to make what I want to make. I know my fans will love it because my fans are loyal to me, but if everybody else loves it, great. If they don't, at least I know, as an artist, I've done what I want to do."<ref name="Harrell" /> ''Anti'' was engineered by Nathaniel Alford, Chris Godbey, Harrell, Blake Mares, Daniela Rivera and Marcos Tovar. The album was finally mastered by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound, in New York City.<ref name="tracklisting" />

{{Quote box
 |quote = On ''Anti'', all of the focus is on that voice and her appealingly wayward personality, singing about sex, love, drugs, desire and frustration as if her life depends on it. Without all the practised song-craft that usually knock the wind out of listeners, what she has come up with is atmospheric, sexy and strangely disturbed, tapping into the kind of distorted beats and chilled tempos that burble through progressive hip hop.

During the album's recording Rihanna aimed to create a record to have "soulful" and "aggressive" sounds in the musical, lyrical and vocal context.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6538937/rihanna-promises-soulful-and-aggressive-vibes-album-V-magazine|title=Rihanna Promises 'Soulful and Aggressive' Vibes for Next Album Release|work=Billboard|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=April 22, 2015|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}</ref> During a press conference in early 2014, Rihanna told [[MTV News]] that she aimed to depart from the musical style of her previous releases, which she described as being "big songs". Rihanna continued to state that with ''Anti'' she wanted to focus on music that "felt real" and soulful and would be timeless.<ref name="timelesssongs">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2106301/rihanna-new-album-sound/|title=Rihanna Finally Opens Up About Her New Album&nbsp;— And It's Gonna Be 'Timeless'|publisher=[[MTV News]]|last=Murphy|first=Shaunna|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref> She also stated that she wanted to record songs that are "timeless" and that she could perform 15 years later. "Not any songs that were burnt out. I find that when I get on stage now, I don't want to perform a lot of my songs. They don't feel like me."<ref name="timelesssongs" />

The album's lyrical content predominantly touches upon themes of relationships, exploring what it means to be in love, to get hurt, to need someone, and to be true to yourself.<ref name="theavclubreview" /> The theme of relationships is picked up in numerous songs; "Kiss It Better" sees Rihanna questioning how far an ex-lover will go to get her back; in "Woo", Rihanna turns spiteful, stating she does not care for her ex-partner, while "Never Ending" features Rihanna admitting she would like to be in love again.<ref name="theavclubreview" /> The album's themes were also noted as being unapologetic, with an uncaring attitude, and self-assurance.<ref name="theindependentreview" />

| quote=<poem>"I sometimes fear that I am misunderstood.
It is simply because what I want to say,
what I need to say, won't be heard.
Heard in a way I so rightfully deserve.
What I choose to say is of so much substance
That people just won't understand the depth of my message.
So my voice is not my weakness,
It is the opposite of what others are afraid of.
My voice is my suit and armor,
My shield, and all that I am.
I will comfortably breathe in it, until I find the moment to be silent.
I live loudly in my mind, so many hours of the day.
The world is pin drop sound compared to the boom
That thumps and bumps against the walls of my cranium.
I live it and love it and despise it and I am entrapped in it.
So being misunderstood, I am not offended by the gesture, but honored.
If they let us..."

On October 7, 2015, Rihanna held a private viewing for fans and press at Los Angeles' [[MAMA Gallery]], where she debuted the album's official artwork and title. Initially thought to have been entitled ''R8'', Rihanna announced the official title during the album's cover art release, revealing the album would be called ''ANTI'', the exhibition included a piece of art which defined the album's title stating that anti is "a person opposed to a particular policy, activity or idea."<ref>{{cite web|title=Rihanna cover changes history of album art|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/rihanna-anti-album-cover-changes-history-of-album-art|website=The Guardian|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref> Following the exhibition, Rihanna took to social media to confirm the album's title along with an explanation of its meaning. The explanation stated, "By continuing to follow her own instincts, her work strives to make an impact by doing the very antithesis of what the public expects."<ref>{{cite web|title=Rihanna anti cover album art R8|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/rihanna-anti-album-cover-changes-history-of-album-art|work=The Guardian|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref>

Over the red, black and white canvas there is a poem written in [[Braille]] by poet Chloe Mitchell. Speaking on her choice to use the language, Rihanna commented, "Sometimes the ones who have sight are the blindest."<ref name="billboardcoverart" /> During the cover's designing stage, Rihanna met with Mitchell, in which they "drank" and came up with a poem that would be used for the artwork and liner notes entitled ''If They Let Us''.<ref name=etonlinecoverart /> Mitchell explained the poem and its meaning to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, stating it was about being misunderstood, but still be able to stand out while doing what is right for you. She further said that the poem speaks about not conforming to society and being a leader as well as accepting that being misunderstood is a positive thing.<ref name=rollingstonecoverart>{{cite web|title=Rihanna's glitzy artsy album cover launch|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-rihannas-glitzy-artsy-album-cover-launch-20151008|work=RollingStone|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref>

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 73, based on 31 reviews.<ref name="MCscore">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/anti/rihanna|title=Reviews for Anti by Rihanna|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] called it "subdued, simmering affair" proving Rihanna could be "unguarded and anti-commercial, resulting in her most compelling record to date".<ref name="allmusicreview" /> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' journalist [[Amanda Petrusich]] called ''Anti'' a "rich and conflicted record at its most interesting when it's at its most idiosyncratic",<ref name="pitchfork" /> while ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Brittany Spanos said that Rihanna had remade [[pop music]] on her own terms with "a sprawling masterpiece of psychedelic soul that's far more straightforward than its tangled rollout".<ref name="rollingstonereview" />

In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Mikael Wood argued that ''Anti'' was the singer's most experimental album yet and "remarkably tender at points", highlighting "Kiss It Better" and the "radical vulnerability" of the ballads near the end.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Mikael|date=January 29, 2016|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-rihanna-anti-review-20160129-story.html|title=With 'Anti,' Rihanna is doing more than saying no|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', Emily Jupp found the record abundant with Rihanna's self-confidence and underrated singing, disapproving "anyone who ever said her voice could only do certain things and showing them she can do anything she wants to."<ref name="theindependentreview" /> Jia Tolentino of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' viewed it as her first "aesthetically personal album" while praising Harrell's vocal production and the singing as "extraordinary", highlighting the tone and roundness of Rihanna's vocals.<ref name="spinreview" /> [[Robert Christgau]] reviewed the deluxe edition in his blog for ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', praising "Work", "Love on the Brain", and the bonus tracks and called ''Anti'' "her best album for a reason so simple it's tautological—despite its supposed rejection of track-and-hook mechanics, it features catchier songs."<ref name="Christgau">{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=March 25, 2016|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/expert-witness-with-robert-christgau-rihanna-the-internet-erykah-badu|title=Stoned Soul Quick Picks: Expert Witness with Robert Christgau|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>

Seven weeks following the release of ''Anti'', the album had been streamed over 275 million times on music platform [[Spotify]] only and sold over 279,000 copies in the United States. Patrick Ryan of ''[[USA Today (magazine)|USA Today]]'' found the sales "impressive", considering the one million copies Rihanna gave away through the Samsung deal and the album being only available for streaming on Tidal in its first week. According to the [[Yahoo Music]] managing editor Lyndsey Parker, the reception of the release, "speaks a lot to the loyalty and patience of her fans.

==Legacy and influence==
Doreen St. Felix of MTV News stated that ''Anti'' was a "rock-star" album and was noted as a "banner for heterogeneity in R&B — the real range of it," continuing to state that in the early 2010s EDM was the popular genre. Felix stated in a more in-depth review that "Anti could even change with the seasons, depending on which tracks you chose to listen to."<ref>{{cite web|author=mtv|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2962120/rihanna-rock-star-in-repose/|title=Rihanna: 2016's Rockstar in Repose|publisher=MTV|date=2016-12-14|accessdate=2016-12-18}}</ref> Alexis Petridis of ''The Guardian'' stated that R&B was in a "golden age" and 2016 "was its most potent year yet". Petridis stated that artists such as Rihanna pushed the genres "boundaries", noting that ''Anti'' "was a "sprawling, exploratory and opaque".<ref>{{cite news|author=03.00 EST|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/16/r-b-golden-age-2016-beyonce-frank-ocean-laura-mvula-dawn-richard|title=R&B is in a golden age – and 2016 was its most potent year yet &#124; Music|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2014-03-13|accessdate=2016-12-18}}</ref> The albums commercial performance, especially its streaming performance, was noted as helping R&B "flourish" again, along with Drake and Kanye West. Rihanna was cited as the second most streamed artist of 2016 overall, earning 795 million streams by June and was named the most streamed female of 2016 and 2017 by [[Spotify]].<ref>http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/drake-rihanna-kanye-west-reportedly-among-most-streamed-artists-this-year-news.22122.html?</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/spotify-most-streamed-artists-2017|title=These Are Spotify's Most-Streamed Artists in 2017|first=Evelyn|last=Wang|website=W Magazine}}</ref>

''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s journalist Brittany Spanos, stated that Rihanna was one of three black women, alongside [[Beyoncé]] and [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], who "radicalized Pop in 2016". In an in-depth review, Spanos stated "The album is a startlingly direct statement from a black female pop star, one that many are not afforded the opportunity to express. In the media, black women are often cast as either jezebels or mammies – oversexed or undersexed with no choice as to how they are received. Rihanna's resistance to typecasting and her positive affirmation of her sexual agency made her the year's slyest rebel, a maverick living life as she pleases."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/how-black-women-radicalized-pop-in-2016-w456817|title=For Us, by Us: How Black Women Radicalized Pop in 2016|website=rollingstone.com}}</ref> Taj Rani of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' stated "Work" has brought the genre of dancehall to the forefront of American music, as it became the first dancehall song to top the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 since [[Sean Paul]]'s "[[Temperature (song)|Temperature]]" reached the feat in 2006.
