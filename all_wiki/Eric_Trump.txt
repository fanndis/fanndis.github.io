The Eric Trump Foundation has advertised that its golf charity events raised money exclusively for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]], with 95–100% of the money raised going toward the charity.

On August 2, 2016, in a television appearance on ''[[CBS This Morning]]'', Trump was asked to comment on his father's controversial statement to ''[[USA Today]]'' the previous day in which he said that if his daughter were ever subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace, he hoped she would find another company to work for or switch careers.

=== 2020 presidential campaign ===
In May 2020, Trump said on Fox News that stay-at-home orders to combat the spread of the coronavirus were a deliberate strategy by the Democrats and the Biden campaign, intended to prevent his father's re-election by depriving him of the ability to conduct large campaign rallies.
