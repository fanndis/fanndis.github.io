==History==

===Hassenfeld Brothers===
Three [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] brothers,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mGGcTsNWYSkC&q=hassenfeld+brothers+poland&pg=PA204|title=Twin Killing|first=James|last=Stanley|date=September 15, 2003|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781410776587|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Companies That Almost Weren&#039;t: Hasbro|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/hasbro-toys-textiles-hassenfeld-family-pencil/12/11/2009/id/25774|date=December 11, 2009|website=Minyanville|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228050124/http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/hasbro-toys-textiles-hassenfeld-family-pencil/12/11/2009/id/25774|archive-date=28 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/hasbro-inc|title=Hasbro Inc &#124; Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>[https://forward.com/culture/film-tv/375181/why-the-transformers-movies-are-really-stories-of-jewish-resilience-and-ada Why The Transformers Movies Are Really Stories Of Jewish Resilience and Adaptability] Nathan Abrams, Forward/</ref> Herman, Hillel, and Henry Hassenfeld<ref name=idch/> founded Hassenfeld Brothers in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], in 1923, a company selling textile remnants. Over the next two decades, the company expanded to produce pencil cases and school supplies. In 1926, Hassenfeld Brothers was incorporated; Hillel left for another textile business while Henry took charge of the corporation. They began making their own pencils when their pencil supplier began making pencil cases as well.<ref name=idch>{{cite web|title=Hasbro, Inc. History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/hasbro-inc-history/|work=International Directory of Company Histories Vol. 16.|publisher=St. James Press|access-date=6 February 2013}}</ref>

Hassenfeld Brothers produced modeling clay and then doctor and nurse kits as their first toys, and they became primarily a toy company by 1942. Hillel died in 1943 and Henry Hassenfeld became CEO, while his son Merrill became president. The company entered the plastic fields during World War II to support its toy line.<ref name=idch/> Hassenfeld Brothers' first toy hit was [[Mr. Potato Head]],<ref name=idch/> which the company purchased from [[George Lerner]] in 1952. In 1954, the company became a [[Disney]] major licensee.<ref name=idch/>

In 1960, Henry died and Merrill took over the parent company, and his older brother Harold ran the pencil-making business of Empire Pencil. Hassenfeld Brothers expanded to Canada with Hassenfeld Brothers (Canada) Ltd. in 1961. The company was approached in 1963 to license a toy based on ''[[The Lieutenant]]'', which they turned down because they did not want to be tied to a possibly short-lived television series. Instead, Hassenfeld Brothers produced the [[G.I. Joe]] toy in 1964 which they termed an "[[action figure]]" in order to market it to boys who wouldn't want to play with dolls. In 1964 and 1965, G.I. Joe accounted for two-thirds of Hassenfeld's sales.<ref name=idch/>

===Hasbro Industries===
The company had previously sold toys under the Hasbro trade name, and it shortened its name to '''Hasbro Industries''' in 1968 and sold a minor stake in the corporation to the public. The unpopular [[Vietnam War]] was at its height in 1969, so Hasbro redesigned GI Joe to be less militaristic and more adventure oriented.<ref name=idch/> Its promotional efforts included the catchphrase "Boy Oh Boy! It's A Hasbro Toy!" in television commercials and print ads. Also in 1969, Hasbro bought [[Claster Television|Burt Claster Enterprises]] which produced "[[Romper Room]]" and had just begun a Romper Room toy line. A month-long Teamsters strike and Far Eastern supplier troubles caused the company to post a $1 million loss for the year.<ref name=idch/>

In 1970, Hasbro began a plan of diversification and opened the Romper Room Nursery School franchise chain to cash in on President [[Richard M. Nixon]]'s Family Assistance Plan which subsidized day care for working mothers. By 1975, the company had ended the nursery chain. Hasbro also entered the cookware field with the [[Galloping Gourmet]] line based on a television cooking show.

Two new 1970s toys were public relations disasters. One of the toys was named [[Lawn darts|Javelin Darts]] which were similar to the ancient Roman ''[[plumbata]]''. On December 19, 1988, the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|Consumer Product Safety Commission]] banned lawn darts from sale in the [[United States]] due to their hazards as a flying projectile with a sharp metal point causing multiple deaths.<ref name="CPSC">{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML97/97122.html |title=Lawn Darts Are Banned and Should Be Destroyed |access-date=2011-01-25 |date=1997-05-15 |publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission |quote=Pointed lawn darts, intended for use in an outdoor game, have been responsible for the deaths of three children.

Both were recalled. Romper Room and its toy line had continued success, although [[Action for Children's Television]] citizens group considered the program to be an advertising channel for toys.<ref name=idch/>

Merrill Hassenfeld took over as CEO in 1974, and his son [[Stephen D. Hassenfeld]] became president. The company became profitable once again but had mixed results due to cash flow problems from increasing the number of toys in the line to offset G.I. Joe's declining sales. Hasbro ended the G.I. Joe line in 1975 because of the rising prices of plastic and crude oil. In 1977, Hasbro's losses were $2.5 million, and the company held a large debt load. That same year, Hasbro acquired licensing rights to ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoon characters. With the financial situation poor, Hasbro's bankers made the company temporarily stop dividend payments in early 1979. The toy division's losses increased Harold Hassenfeld's resentment regarding the company's treatment of the Empire Pencil subsidiary as Empire received lower levels of capital spending relative to profits than did the toy division.

With Merrill's death in 1979, Harold did not recognize Stephen's authority as the successor to the chairman and CEO position. As a solution, Hasbro spun off Empire Pencil in 1980, which was the nation's largest pencil maker, with Harold trading his Hasbro shares for those of Empire. Stephen then became both the CEO and chairman of the board. Between 1978 and 1981, Stephen reduced the Hasbro product line by one-third and its new products by one-half. Hasbro focused on simple, low cost, longer life-cycle toys like Mr. Potato Head. Hasbro thus stayed out of the electronic games field which went bust in the early 1980s.

In 1982, Hasbro revived its G.I. Joe line with the help of [[Marvel Comics]], as an [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorist]] commando based on current events. The company launched the successful [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] toy line along with a [[The Transformers (TV series)|children's animated TV series]] two years later. With the toys and TV series being popular, Stephen Hassenfeld posed with the toys for a ''People'' magazine cover photo.

In 1982, Hasbro produced the successful toy franchise [[My Little Pony]]. In 1983, they purchased GLENCO Infant Items, a manufacturer of infant products and the world's largest bib producer, and Knickerbocker Toy Company, a struggling [[Warner Communications]] subsidiary. Hasbro paid 37% of its stock to Warner, which was paid into Hasbro's executive-controlled voting trust, and also received a cash infusion. In 1984, [[Alan G. Hassenfeld]] took over as president from his brother Stephen, who continued as CEO and chairman. That same year, the company was the nation's sixth best-selling toymaker, and then acquired the [[Milton Bradley Company]], which was the nation's fifth best-selling toymaker. This brought [[The Game of Life]], [[Twister (game)|Twister]], [[Easy Money (board game)|Easy Money]], and [[Playskool]] into the Hasbro fold and transformed Hasbro into '''Hasbro Bradley'''. Stephen Hassenfeld became the merged company's president and CEO, with Milton Bradley chief James Shea Jr. taking the chairman position. However, the executives clashed and Shea left after a few months, and Stephen and Alan returned to their previous positions.<ref name=idch/>

===Hasbro===
====1985–2007====
In 1985, the company changed its name again to just '''Hasbro, Inc.'''<ref name=idch/> The Jumpstarters toys were the subject of a lawsuit in 1985 when Hasbro sued a toy manufacturer for selling toys based on their Transformers design. Hasbro won the suit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/780_F2d_189.htm|title=Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v. Sparkle Toys, Inc., 780 F.2d 189 (2nd Cir. 1985)}}</ref>

In the mid-1980s, Hasbro moved past [[Mattel]] to become the world's largest toy company. Hasbro then moved to outsell Mattel's [[Barbie]] in the fashion doll market with the 1986 introduction of [[Jerrica Benton|Jem]], a record producer/rock musician dual identity fashion doll. Jem initially posted strong sales but plummeted and was withdrawn from the market in 1987. Hasbro followed up in 1988 with [[Maxie's World#Maxie toy line|Maxie]], a Barbie-sized blonde doll, so that Barbie clothing and accessories would fit. Maxie lasted until 1990.<ref name=idch/>

Under Alan's initiative in the late 1980s, Hasbro moved to increase international sales by taking toys overseas that had failed in the US market and selling them for as much as four times the original price. This increased international sales from $268 million in 1985 to $433 million in 1988.<ref name=idch/>

In 1988, Hasbro purchased part of [[Coleco]] Industries' indoor and outdoor children's furniture and ride-on toy product lines for $21 million including two just closed manufacturing plants in Amsterdam, N.Y.<ref>{{cite news|title=Company News; Hasbro in Accord For Coleco Lines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/business/company-news-hasbro-in-accord-for-coleco-lines.html?src=pm|access-date=8 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 12, 1988}}</ref> In July 1989, Hasbro acquired bankrupt [[Coleco]] for $85 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Company News; Hasbro's Purchase Of Coleco's Assets|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/13/business/company-news-hasbro-s-purchase-of-coleco-s-assets.html?src=pm|access-date=8 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 13, 1989|agency=AP}}</ref> Stephen Hassenfeld died later that year with the company having gone from sales of $104 million in the year he took control to 1989 sales of over $1.4 billion.<ref name=idch/>

Alan succeeded Stephen as chairman and CEO. In 1991, Hasbro purchased Tonka Corp. for $486 million, along with its units [[Parker Brothers]], the maker of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], and [[Kenner Products]]. Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers were merged into one division. Alan moved to expand Hasbro overseas with new units in Greece, Hungary, and Mexico.<ref name=idch/>

Alan saw the Far East as an important market to expand. In 1992, Hasbro purchased Nomura Toys Ltd. in Japan, and majority ownership of Palmyra, a Southeast Asian toy distributor. These increased the proportion of international sales from 22% in 1985 to 45% ($1.28 billion) in 1995. In 1993, Hasbro lost its bid for [[J. W. Spear & Sons]], a U.K.-based game maker, to [[Mattel]].<ref name=idch/>

In the US, Hasbro's growth since 1980 were from acquisitions and the leveraging of the new assets. New product development was not as successful except for movie and TV tie-in product lines with [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]] and [[Barney & Friends|Barney]]. Thus, US sales were stagnant in the early 1990s, falling from 1993 to 1995. To turn domestic performance around in 1994, Hasbro merged the Hasbro Toy, Playskool, Playskool Baby, Kenner, and Kid Dimension units into the Hasbro Toy Group.  Meanwhile, Mattel purchased [[Fisher-Price]] and retook the top spot in the toy industry.<ref name=idch/>

[[Hasbro Interactive]] was started in 1995 and released the Monopoly game on CD-ROM. Mattel also proposed a merger that year, but was turned down by the Hasbro board in 1996 due to antitrust issues and Justice Department investigation into exclusionary policies between toy manufacturers and toy retailers, particularly [[Toys "R" Us]].<ref name=idch/>

In 1998, Hasbro bought [[Avalon Hill]] for $6 million<ref>{{cite news|last=Leffall |first=J.|title=Monarch Avalon to sell game unit to Hasbro In wake of loss, local company to get $6 million in cash|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-08-05/business/1998217009_1_avalon-hasbro-monarch-services|access-date=9 February 2013|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=August 5, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=L. de Rosa|first1=Peter|title=The Fall of Avalon Hill|journal=Academic Gaming Review|date=Summer 2002|volume=4|issue=4|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~pdr4455/fah.html|access-date=June 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129025756/http://home.earthlink.net/~pdr4455/fah.html|archive-date=January 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Galoob]] for $220 million.<ref name="hasbrosale">Fost, Dan.[http://articles.sfgate.com/1998-09-29/business/17730903_1_hasbro-galoob-star-wars-lucasfilm Hasbro Adds Galoob to Its Toy Chest]."

In 2009, [[Hasbro Studios]] was formed for TV development, production and distribution.

Hasbro collaborated with [[Discovery Communications|Discovery]] on [[Hub Network|The Hub]], a cable network targeting young children and families, which launched on October 10, 2010.

* ''[[Brain Warp]]'' and its sister products which include ''Brain Shift'', ''Brain Bash'', ''Death Star Escape'', ''Hyperslide'' and ''Torx''.

Hasbro also offers a memory game called ''Simon'' which involves memorising sequences of colors and lights.

In 1995, Hasbro began a short-lived [[Video game developer|video game development]] and [[video game publisher|publishing]] venture called [[Hasbro Interactive]], but disbanded it in 2001 when it was bought by the now defunct [[Infogrames Entertainment, SA|Infogrames]]. Now Hasbro develops video games based on its brands through third-party developers and licensing strategies, notably with major American companies such as [[Activision]], [[Electronic Arts]], and [[THQ]]. Following the rise of [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablet PCs]] in the 2010s, as well as major video gaming publishers cutting back on releasing games based on licensed IPs for various reasons, such as [[Great Recession|economic slumps]], several of Hasbro's brands were licensed towards mobile game developers such as [[Gameloft]], releasing their games under the label Hasbro Gaming.

On February 25, 2005, Hasbro announced that it would be introducing a musical [[toothbrush]] to the market. The ''[[Tooth Tunes]]'', released in early 2007, transmits music from the [[Human mandible|jawbone]] to the ear when the bristles touch the teeth.

==Criticism and controversy==
In 2007, a workers' rights group investigated several of Hasbro's Chinese suppliers and found that, in one instance, a toy factory in China's [[Guangxi Province]] had hired 1000 [[junior high school]] students. The same group discovered other widespread [[Labour law|labor violations]], including unsafe working conditions, mandatory overtime, [[verbal abuse]] and [[sexual harassment]] of employees. Hasbro issued a statement, saying that it would "act swiftly and decisively in making any necessary changes" and had "increased the intensity of [its] ongoing safety review efforts." Critics pointed out that Hasbro had no official regulatory control of these factories. Hasbro responded by hiring independent auditors. These auditors make unannounced visits to the [[East Asian]] subcontractors. Reports then emerged that the factory managers have been coached in how to fool the auditors.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/business/worldbusiness/22factory.html?ref=business "U.S. Group Accuses Chinese Toy Factories of Labor Abuses"] from ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>

Hasbro has also been criticized for focusing some of its products on specific demographic groups. For example, a letter spread widely on [[social media]] in November 2012 written by a six-year-old Irish girl complaining about the lack of female characters in the guessing game ''[[Guess Who?]]''<ref name="independent.co.uk">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/guess-whos-sexist-classic-board-games-gender-bias-leaves-sixyearold-fuming-8324067.html "Guess Who's sexist? Classic board game's gender bias leaves six-year-old fuming] from ''[[The Independent]]''</ref> This garnered attention in the press after the girl's mother posted the exchange on her blog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byjenniferoconnell.com/2012/11/hasbro-knows-all-about-selling-to-kids.html |title=Hasbro knows all about selling to kids – and nothing much about talking to them |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306084349/http://www.byjenniferoconnell.com/2012/11/hasbro-knows-all-about-selling-to-kids.html |archive-date=March 6, 2013}}</ref> ''Guess Who?'' had previously received complaints over gender and ethnic bias in its choice of 24 images.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

Hasbro primarily sells toys directed at either the girl or boy markets. As such, there have been criticisms that Hasbro's toys reinforce [[gender stereotypes]]. For example, in December 2012, 13-year-old McKenna Pope started a campaign on [[Change.org]], calling on the company to create a "boy-friendly" version of the popular [[Easy-Bake Oven]] and to feature boys on their packaging and materials.<ref name="auto">[http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/teen-starts-campaign-gender-neutral-easy-bake-oven-155338662--abc-news-topstories.html "Teen starts campaign for gender neutral Easy Bake Oven"] from ''[[Good Morning America]]''</ref><ref name="auto1">[https://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/04/business/la-fi-easy-bake-20121204 "Teen girl petitions Hasbro to market Easy Bake Oven also to boys"] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref> Within a week, over 30,000 people signed her petition.<ref name="auto2">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/living/gender-toy-marketing-petition/?hpt=hp_c2|title=Teen says pink toy ovens discourage boys from kitchen play|author=Emanuella Grinberg, CNN|date=December 6, 2012|work=CNN}}</ref>

Hasbro was criticized for "sexist" product design when its 2015 [[Star Wars]] [[Monopoly board game]] failed to feature [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], the female protagonist in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', while including all of the supporting male characters. Hasbro explained that Rey was left out of the Monopoly game to avoid spoilers, because the game was released months before the movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/1/5/10715144/hasbro-explains-why-rey-was-excluded-from-star-wars-monopoly|title=Hasbro explains why Rey was excluded from Star Wars: Monopoly (update)|date=January 5, 2016}}</ref> On January 5, 2016, Hasbro announced that Rey would be included in future versions.  Hasbro later stated that it struggled to distribute the updated Monopoly game that includes the Rey piece, because retailers (especially in the United States) showed "insufficient interest" after having already purchased stock of the first release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/13/star-wars-hasbro-on-why-the-rey-piece-is-still-missing-from-monopoly|title=Star Wars: Hasbro on why the Rey piece is still missing from Monopoly|date=July 12, 2017}}</ref>

On October 2, 2015, Lorraine Markham sued Hasbro for breach of contract for failure to pay royalties to her. She was seeking a declaration from the U.S. District Court in Providence that her husband Bill Markham was the sole creator of ''[[The Game of Life]]''.<ref name="auto3">{{cite web|title=Complaint|url=http://www.pacermonitor.com/view/JYBB46Q/Markham_Concepts_Inc_v_Hasbro_Inc__ridce-15-00419__0001.0.pdf|website=PacerMonitor|access-date=16 November 2015}}</ref>

In early August 2020, Hasbro produced a DreamWorks Animation [[Troll doll]] device for [[pre-school]] age children which had an unadvertised activator on the doll's private parts that caused the device to emit several audio recordings that were questioned by some American mothers; in particular one of them posted a [[Facebook]] video stream that went [[Viral video|viral]]. In it, she questioned whether the intent was to [[Child grooming|groom]] children for depravity: "It makes a gasping sound when you touch her privates. And to me it's just like sexual sounds, and it's so disturbing. This is 100% why I say that they have been GROOMING kids all along." A Hasbro senior officer for global communications quickly back-pedalled and protested that it was "not intentional" and the company removed the device from the marketplace. A writer for [[USA Today]] opined that "We rate the claim that the doll was designed to groom children as PARTLY FALSE."<ref name="dsfact">{{cite news|last1=Stanglin|first1=Doug|date=7 August 2020|title=Fact check: Troll doll button in 'private' area not intentional or part of kids 'grooming'|publisher=USA TODAY|agency=Gannett Satellite Information Network|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/08/07/fact-check-troll-doll-draws-fire-giggle-button-private-parts/3307417001/}}</ref>
