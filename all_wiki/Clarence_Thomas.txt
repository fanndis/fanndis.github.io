{{Conservatism in the United States}}
'''Clarence Thomas''' (born June 23, 1948) is an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]]. He was [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] by President [[George H. W. Bush]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|U. S. Senate]] to succeed [[Thurgood Marshall]] and is the second [[African Americans|African American]] to serve on the Court. Thomas has served as the Senior Associate Justice, the longest-serving member of the Court, since 2018 with a tenure of {{ayd|1991|10|23}} as of {{FULLDATE}}.

Thomas grew up in [[Savannah, Georgia]], and was educated at the [[College of the Holy Cross]] and [[Yale Law School]]. He was appointed an [[Missouri Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] in [[Missouri]] in 1974, and later entered private practice there. In 1979, he became a [[legislative assistant]] to [[United States Senator|United States senator]] [[John Danforth]], and in 1981 was appointed Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. In 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed Thomas Chairman of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC).

In 1990, President [[George H. W. Bush]] nominated Thomas for a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. He served in that role for 16 months before filling Marshall's seat on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Thomas's confirmation hearings]] were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] attorney [[Anita Hill]], a subordinate at the Department of Education and at the EEOC. Hill claimed that Thomas made multiple sexual and romantic overtures to her, despite her repeatedly telling him to stop. Thomas and his supporters asserted that Hill, as well as the witnesses on her behalf and supporters, had fabricated the allegations to prevent the appointment of a Black conservative to the Court. The Senate ultimately confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48.<ref name="Senate.gov">{{cite news |title= Roll Call Vote 102nd Congress - 1st Session |work=Senate.gov |date=October 15, 1991 |url= https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=102&session=1&vote=00220 |access-date=May 19, 2020}}</ref>

Supreme Court experts describe Thomas's jurisprudence as textualist, stressing the [[original meaning]] of the [[United States Constitution]] and statutes. He is also, along with fellow justice [[Neil Gorsuch]], an advocate of [[natural law]]. Thomas is viewed by many writers as the most [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] member of the court.<ref name="The New York Times">{{cite news |title=An Older, More Conservative Court |first=Sheryl Gay |last=Stolberg|author-link=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 27, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/27/us/older-and-more-conservative-court.html |access-date=December 11, 2012}}</ref><ref name="National Public Radio">{{cite news |title=Clarence Thomas' Influence On The Supreme Court |first=Nina|last=Totenberg|author-link=Nina Totenberg|website=[[NPR]] |date=October 11, 2011 |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/11/141246695/clarence-thomas-influence-on-the-court |access-date=December 11, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="The New Yorker">{{cite news |title=Partners |first=Jeffrey|last=Toobin|author-link=Jeffrey Toobin|work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=August 29, 2011 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/29/110829fa_fact_toobin |access-date=December 11, 2012}}</ref> He is also known for having gone over a decade without asking any questions during oral arguments.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/29/468576931/clarence-thomas-asks-1st-question-from-supreme-court-bench-in-10-years |title=Clarence Thomas Asks 1st Question From Supreme Court Bench In 10 Years |date=February 29, 2016 |first=Laura |last=Wagner |publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref>

Thomas was then treated with amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time.<ref name="oyez.org" /> Myers Anderson had little formal education, but built a thriving [[fuel oil]] business that also sold ice.

===Education===

Raised [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], he attended the predominantly Black [[St. Pius X]] high school for two years before transferring to [[Jean-Marie Vianney|St. John Vianney's]] Minor [[Seminary]] on the [[Isle of Hope]], where he was an honor student among few Black students.<ref name="abc news3" /><ref name="businessweek">{{cite web |last=Brady |first=Diane |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2007-03-11/online-extra-supreme-court-justice-clarence-thomas-speaks |title=Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas Speaks |work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|location=New York City |date=March 12, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312181418/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_11/b4025080.htm |archive-date=March 12, 2007 |access-date=July 27, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> He also briefly attended [[Conception Seminary College]], a Roman Catholic [[seminary]] in [[Missouri]].

After graduation, Thomas studied for the Missouri bar at [[Saint Louis University School of Law]].  Thomas was admitted to the Missouri bar on September 13, 1974.{{sfn|Foskett|2004|p=139}} From 1974 to 1977, he was an Assistant Attorney General of Missouri under State Attorney General [[John Danforth]], a fellow alumnus at Yale. Thomas was the only African-American member of Danforth's staff.{{sfn|Foskett|2004|p=138}} He first worked at the criminal appeals division of Danforth's office and moved on to the revenue and taxation division.{{sfn|Foskett|2004|pp=139–40}} Retrospectively, he considers the Assistant Attorney General position the best job he has ever had.{{sfn|Foskett|2004|p=147}} When Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney with the [[Monsanto Chemical Company]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].{{sfn|Foskett|2004|pp=147, 149}}

He moved to Washington, D.C. and again worked for Danforth from 1979 to 1981 as a Legislative Assistant handling energy issues for the [[Senate Commerce Committee]].{{sfn|Foskett|2004|p=149}} The two men shared a common bond in that they had studied to be ordained, although in different [[Christian denomination|denominations]]. Danforth championed Thomas for the Supreme Court.

In 1981, he joined the Reagan administration, serving first as [[Assistant Secretary of Education for the Office for Civil Rights]] in the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]], and then, from 1982 to 1990, as chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). Journalist [[Evan Thomas]] once opined that Thomas was "openly ambitious for higher office" during his tenure at the EEOC. As Chairman, he promoted a doctrine of self-reliance, and halted the usual EEOC approach of filing [[class-action]] discrimination lawsuits, instead pursuing acts of individual discrimination.<ref name="newsweek-thomas-1991">{{Cite news|work=[[Newsweek]] | publisher=[[Washington Post Company]]|location=New York City|date = July 15, 1991 | access-date =April 20, 2009 | first = Evan | last = Thomas | author-link = Evan Thomas | title = Where Does He Stand? | url = http://www.newsweek.com/1991/07/14/where-does-he-stand.html}}</ref> He also asserted in 1984 that Black leaders were "watching the destruction of our race" as they "bitch, bitch, bitch" about Reagan instead of working with the [[Reagan administration]] to alleviate [[teenage pregnancy]], unemployment and [[illiteracy]].<ref>{{Cite news| last = Williams | first = Juan | author-link = Juan Williams | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/10/25/eeoc-chairman-blasts-black-leaders/1f7fe039-e807-48ca-a92c-fd7bfcba3345/ | title = EEOC Chairman Blasts Black Leaders |work=[[The Washington Post]]| publisher=[[Washington Post Company]]|location=Washingyon, D.C.|date = October 25, 1984 | access-date =July 27, 2018 }}</ref>

=== Conservatism and originalism ===
Thomas is often described as an [[originalist]] and as a [[textualism|textualist]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/law/supreme_court/justices/thomas.html Supreme Court Watch, ''Profile: Justice Clarence Thomas''] [[Public Broadcasting Service]].</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/opinion/03sun4.html|first=Adam|last=Cohen, Adam|title=The Next Big Thing in Law?

Thomas's jurisprudence has also been described as similar to that of Justice [[Hugo Black]], who "resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'"<ref name=Marzulla>Marzulla, Nancie.

=== Voting alignment ===
Thomas voted most frequently with Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] in his early tenure on the Supreme Court.<ref name="georgia-encyclopedia" /> On average, from 1994 to 2004, Scalia and Thomas had an 87% voting alignment, the highest on the court, followed by [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] and [[David Souter]] (86%).<ref name="Harvard">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070113154756/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/118/Nov04/Nine_Justices_Ten_YearsFTX.pdf "Nine Justices, Ten Years: A Statistical Retrospective"], ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', volume 118, page 513 (2004).</ref> Scalia and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996, at 98%.<ref name="Harvard" /> By 2004, however, other pairs of justices were observed to be more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Will|last=Baude|title=Brothers in Law|magazine=[[The New Republic]]|date=June 30, 2004|quote=Justices Souter and Ginsburg were in complete agreement in 85 percent of the Court's decisions. Chief Justice Rehnquist agreed with Justice O'Connor in 79 percent and Justice Kennedy in 77 percent. Justices Stevens and Souter agreed 77 percent of the time; so did Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. Thomas and Scalia agreed in only 73 percent of the cases. Thomas regularly breaks with Scalia, disagreeing on points of doctrine, finding a more measured and judicial tone, and calling for the elimination of bad law. Unless he is simply a very bad yes-man, Clarence Thomas is a more independent voice than most people give him credit for.}}</ref>

The conventional wisdom that Thomas's votes follow Scalia's is reflected by [[Linda Greenhouse]]'s observation that Thomas voted with Scalia 91 percent of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] the least, 36% of the time.<ref>{{cite news|first=Linda|last=Greenhouse|author-link=Linda Greenhouse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/washington/01scotus.html|title=In Steps Big and Small, Supreme Court, Moved Right|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=July 1, 2007}}</ref> [[Jan Crawford]] asserts that to some extent, this is true in the other direction as well, that Scalia often joins Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|pp=115–26}} Statistics compiled annually by Tom Goldstein of [[SCOTUSblog]] demonstrate that Greenhouse's count is methodology-specific, counting non-unanimous cases where Scalia and Thomas voted for the same litigant, regardless of whether they got there by the same reasoning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/NonUnanAgreementOT06.pdf |title=EAST-#7825019-v1-OT06_Non-Unan_Agreement.XLS |access-date=June 20, 2010}}</ref> Goldstein's statistics show that the two agreed in full only 74% of the time, and that the frequency of agreement between Scalia and Thomas is not as outstanding as is often implied by pieces aimed at lay audiences. For example, in that same term, Souter and Ginsburg voted together 81% of the time by the method of counting that yields a 74% agreement between Thomas and Scalia. By the metric that produces the 91% Scalia/Thomas figure, Ginsburg and Breyer agreed 90% of the time. Roberts and Alito agreed 94% of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/AgreementFinalOT06.pdf |title=EAST-#7824858-v1-OT06_Agreement_2.XLS |website=[[SCOTUSBlog.com]]|access-date=June 20, 2010}}</ref>

Crawford wrote in her book on the Supreme Court that Thomas's forceful views moved "moderates like [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] further to the left"{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=166}} but frequently attracted votes from Rehnquist and Scalia.{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|pp=114–37}} [[Mark Tushnet]] and [[Jeffrey Toobin]] opined that Rehnquist rarely assigned important majority opinions to Thomas because the latter's views made it difficult for him to persuade a majority of justices to join him.<ref>Mark Tushnet, A Court Divided 85–6 (2006); Jeffrey Toobin, The Nine 119 (2008).</ref>

=== Number of dissenting opinions ===
From 1994 to 2004, on average, Thomas was the third most frequent dissenter on the court, behind Stevens and Scalia.<ref name="Harvard" /> Four other justices dissented as frequently in 2007.<ref name="Stats07">{{cite journal|url=http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/nov07/statistics07.pdf|title=The Statistics|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|location=New Haven, Connecticut|date=November 2007|volume=121|page=439|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225230700/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/nov07/statistics07.pdf |archive-date=February 25, 2009 }}</ref> Three other justices dissented as frequently in 2006.<ref name="Stats06">[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/120/nov06/statistics06.pdf "The Statistics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225230659/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/120/nov06/statistics06.pdf |date=February 25, 2009 }}, ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', volume 120, page 372 (2006).</ref> One other justice dissented as frequently in 2005.<ref name="Stats05">[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/119/Nov05/Statistics.pdf "The Statistics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225230656/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/119/Nov05/Statistics.pdf |date=February 25, 2009 }}, ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', volume 119, page 415 (2005).</ref>

=== ''Stare decisis'' ===
{{See also|Precedent#U.S. legal system|l1=''Stare decisis'' in the U.S. legal system}}
Thomas spoke favorably about the concept of ''[[stare decisis]]''—that the Court is bound by its preceding decisions—during his confirmation hearings, stating that "''stare decisis'' provides continuity to our system, it provides predictability, and in our process of case-by-case decision making, I think it is a very important and critical concept."<ref name="wash post2">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31117-2004Oct13.html "A Big Question About Clarence Thomas"], ''The Washington Post'', October 14, 2004. Retrieved May 7, 2007.</ref> However, according to Antonin Scalia, Thomas "doesn't believe in ''stare decisis'', period."<ref name="wash post2"/> This assessment is consistent with Thomas's record on the bench: factoring in length of tenure, Thomas urged overruling and joined in overruling precedents more frequently than any other justice during the Rehnquist Court.<ref name="over">Gerhardt, Michael. ''The Power of Precedent'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=HOgeAC0T0aEC&pg=PA247 pages 249 (ranked eleventh for overturning precedent)] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=hNcfgzuSTS4C&pg=PA12 12 (most frequently urged overturning)] (Oxford University Press 2008).</ref>

Also according to Scalia, Thomas is more willing to overrule constitutional cases than he was: "If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say let's get it right. I wouldn't do that."<ref>Ringel, Jonathan. [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1090180289132 "The Bombshell in the Clarence Thomas Biography"], [http://www.dailyreportonline.com/ Daily Report] via Law.com (August 5, 2004).</ref> Law professor [[Michael Gerhardt]], however, says that Scalia's characterization of Thomas may be incorrect, given that Thomas has supported leaving a broad spectrum of constitutional decisions intact.<ref>Gerhardt, Michael. "The Power of Precedent", [https://books.google.com/books?id=HOgeAC0T0aEC&pg=PA188 page 188] (Oxford University Press 2008): "I am not sure Justice Scalia is even right about Justice Thomas, who does not, at least statistically, urge more than three overrulings per term, thus indicating his willingness to leave a fairly broad spectrum of constitutional decisions intact."</ref> Thomas's belief in originalism is strong; he has said, "When faced with a clash of constitutional principle and a line of unreasoned cases wholly divorced from the text, history, and structure of our founding document, we should not hesitate to resolve the tension in favor of the Constitution's original meaning."{{sfn|Toobin|2007|p=120}} Thomas believes that an erroneous decision can and should be overturned, no matter how old it is.{{sfn|Toobin|2007|p=120}}

In 2005, while Assistant Professor of Law at [[Notre Dame Law School]], [[Amy Coney Barrett]] wrote that Thomas supports statutory ''stare decisis''. Her cited examples include Thomas's concurring opinion in ''[[Fogerty v. Fantasy]]'', {{ussc|510|517|1994}}.<ref>Barrett, Amy. [https://ssrn.com/abstract=670521 "Statutory Stare Decisis in the Courts of Appeals"], ''[[George Washington Law Review]]'' (2005).</ref>

In ''[[Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt (2019)|Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt]]'' (2019), Thomas wrote the 5–4 decision along ideological lines overruling ''[[Nevada v. Hall]]'' (1979), the earlier decision which said states could be sued in courts of other states. Thomas stated that ''stare decisis'' “is not an inexorable command.” Thomas explicitly disavowed the concept of reliance interests as justification for adhering to precedent. In dissent from ''Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal.'', Justice Stephen Breyer asked what other decisions might eventually be overruled. Breyer suggested ''Roe v. Wade'' (1973) might be overruled. Breyer stated that it is best to leave precedents alone unless they are widely seen as erroneous or become impractical.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/us/politics/supreme-court-precedent-vote.html|title=Justices Split Over the Power of Precedent|first=Adam|last=Liptak|date=May 13, 2019|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1299_8njq.pdf |title=Franchise Tax Board of California v.

In ''[[Flowers v. Mississippi]]'' (2019), a 7–2 decision, in a dissent from the ruling overturning Mississippi resident [[Curtis Flowers]]’ death sentence, joined only by Neil Gorsuch, Thomas wrote an opinion that suggests ''[[Batson v. Kentucky]]'' (1986), which forbids prosecutors from using race as a factor in making peremptory challenges in jury selection, was wrongly decided and should be overruled. Gorsuch, however, did not join the section of Thomas's opinion suggesting ''Batson'' should be overruled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-9572_k536.pdf |title=FLOWERS v. MISSISSIPPI |date=2018 |website=supremecourt.gov |access-date=June 29, 2019}}</ref>

=== Commerce Clause ===
Thomas has consistently supported narrowing the court's interpretation of the constitution's [[Interstate Commerce Clause]] (which often is simply called the "Commerce Clause") to limit federal power. At the same time, Thomas has broadly interpreted states' [[sovereign immunity]] from lawsuits under the Commerce Clause.<ref>''E.g.'', ''[[Seminole Tribe v. Florida]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=517&page=44 517 U.S. 44 (1996). Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.]</ref>

In ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' and ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'', the court held that Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to regulate non-commercial activities. In these cases, Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion arguing for the original meaning of the Commerce Clause. Subsequently, in ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'', the court interpreted the Interstate Commerce Clause combined with the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] to empower the federal government to arrest, [[prosecute]], and [[imprison]] patients who used marijuana grown at home for medicinal purposes, even where the activity is legal in that particular state. Thomas dissented in ''Raich'', again arguing for the original meaning of the Commerce Clause.

Thomas and Scalia had rejected the notion of a [[Dormant Commerce Clause]], also known as the "Negative Commerce Clause". That doctrine bars state commercial regulation even if Congress has not yet acted on the matter.<ref>''[[United Haulers Assn. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth.]]'' [http://www2.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-1345.ZS.html 550 U.S. 330 (2007).] Full text opinion courtesy of [[Cornell University]]</ref>

In ''Lopez,'' Thomas expressed his view that federal regulation of either manufacturing or agriculture is unconstitutional; he sees both as outside the scope of the Commerce Clause.<ref>''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/u10287.html 514 U.S. 549 (1995).] Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.</ref>{{sfn|Toobin|2007|p=100}} He believes federal legislators have overextended the Commerce Clause, while some of his critics argue that Thomas's position on congressional authority would invalidate much of the contemporary work of the federal government.{{sfn|Toobin|2007|p=100}} According to Thomas, it is not the court's job to update the constitution. Proponents of broad national power such as Professor [[Michael C. Dorf|Michael Dorf]] deny that they are trying to update the constitution. Instead, they argue that they are merely addressing a set of economic facts that did not exist when the constitution was framed.<ref>[[Michael C. Dorf|Dorf, Michael]]. [http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dorf/20080729.html "What California's Trans Fat Ban Teaches Us About Federalism"], ''[[Writ (website)|Findlaw's Writ]]'' (July 29, 2008): "Proponents of broad national power like myself do not say that the Court should update the Constitution to keep it in tune with the times. Rather, we argue—or at least some of us argue—that the growth of a national, indeed, global, economy, means that activities that might have been carried out in relatively discrete local markets in 1789 are now undoubtedly part of interstate and international commerce."</ref>

=== Executive power, federalism, and federal statutes ===

==== Executive power ====

Thomas has argued that the [[executive branch]] has broad authority under the constitution and federal statutes. In ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]],'' he was the only justice who agreed with the Fourth Circuit that Congress had power to authorize the president's detention of U.S. citizens who are [[enemy combatants]]. Thomas granted the federal government the "strongest presumptions" and said "[[due process]] requires nothing more than a good-faith executive determination" to justify the imprisonment of Hamdi, a U.S. citizen.<ref>''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=542&page=507 542 U.S. 507 (2004). Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.]</ref>

Thomas also was one of three justices who dissented in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', which held that the [[Guantanamo military commission|military commissions]] set up by the Bush administration to try detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]] required explicit congressional authorization, and held that the commissions conflicted with both the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) and "at least" Common Article Three of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]].<ref>''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', [http://supreme.vlex.com/vid/hamdan-v-rumsfeld-320635 548 U.S. 557 (2006).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809081654/http://supreme.vlex.com/vid/hamdan-v-rumsfeld-320635 |date=August 9, 2011 }}</ref> Thomas argued that Hamdan was an [[Unlawful combatant|illegal combatant]] and therefore not protected by the Geneva Convention, and he agreed with Justice Scalia that the court was "patently erroneous" in its declaration of jurisdiction in this case.

In the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] case ''East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump'' (2018), which placed an injunction on the Donald Trump administration's asylum policy, Thomas dissented from a denial of stay application. The Ninth Circuit imposed an injunction on the Trump administration's policy only granted asylum to refugees entering from a designated port of entry, ruling that it violates the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]]. Ninth Circuit Judge [[Jay Bybee]]’s majority opinion in an injunction order concluded that denial of the ability to apply for asylum regardless of entry point is "the hollowest of rights that an alien must be allowed to apply for asylum regardless of whether she arrived through a port of entry if another rule makes her categorically ineligible for asylum based on precisely that fact." Thomas's Supreme Court colleagues [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Samuel Alito]], and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] also dissented in the 5–4 Supreme Court decision to deny a stay to the Ninth Circuit's injunction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2018/12/07/18-17274.pdf |title=Immigration / Temporary Restraining Order /Preliminary Injunction |date=December 7, 2018 |website=cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov |access-date=June 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/122118zr_986b.pdf |title=TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF U.S., ET AL.

==== Federalism ====
[[Federalism]] was a central part of the Rehnquist Court's constitutional agenda.<ref name="agenda" /> Thomas consistently voted for outcomes that promoted state-governmental authority, in cases involving federalism-based limits on Congress's enumerated powers.<ref name="agenda">Joondeph, Bradley [https://ssrn.com/abstract=1019648 "Federalism, the Rehnquist Court, and the Modern Republican Party"], ''[[University of Oregon School of Law|Oregon Law Review]]'', Volume 87 (2008): "Most scholars agree that federalism was central to the Rehnquist Court's constitutional agenda."</ref> According to law professor [[Ann Althouse]], the court has yet to move toward "the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas."<ref name="Althouse">[[Ann Althouse|Althouse, Ann]].

In ''[[Foucha v. Louisiana]]'', Thomas dissented from the majority opinion that required the removal from a mental institution of a prisoner who had become sane.{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=117}} The court held that a Louisiana statute violated the [[Due Process Clause]] "because it allows an insanity acquittee to be committed to a mental institution until he is able to demonstrate that he is not dangerous to himself and others, even though he does not suffer from any mental illness."<ref name="Foucha">''[[Foucha v.

==== Federal statutes ====
As of 2007, Thomas was the justice most willing to exercise [[judicial review]] of federal statutes, but among the least likely to overturn state statutes.<ref>Ringhand, Lori.  "[http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/fac_artchop/370/ Judicial Activism: An Empirical Examination of Voting Behavior on the Rehnquist Natural Court]", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 24, No. 1 (Spring 2007), pp. 49 (Table 1) and 59 (Table 6).</ref>
According to a ''The New York Times'' editorial, "from 1994 to 2005 ...

In the 2009 ''[[Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder]]'' case, Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting in favor of throwing out Section Five of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to get Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Although Congress had reauthorized Section Five in 2006 for another 25 years, Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, pointing out that the rate of black voting in seven Section Five states was higher than the national average. Thomas said "the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains."<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-322.ZX.html NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL.

=== Bill of Rights ===
==== First Amendment ====
By 2002, Thomas was the second most likely among the nine justices to uphold [[free speech]] claims (tied with [[David Souter]]).<ref>{{cite web|first=Eugene|last=Volokh|author-link=Eugene Volokh|url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/howvoted.htm|title=How the Justices Voted in Free Speech Cases, 1994–2000"] (Updated), 48 UCLA L.

On occasion, however, Thomas has disagreed with free speech claimants. For example, he dissented in ''[[Virginia v. Black]]'', a case that struck down part of a Virginia statute that banned [[cross burning]]. Concurring in ''[[Morse v. Frederick]]'', he argued that the free speech rights of students in [[public school (government funded)|public schools]] are limited.<ref name="Morse">''[[Morse v. Frederick]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/06-278.html 551 U.S. 393 (2007). Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.]</ref> In ''[[Walker v.

Thomas authored the decision in ''[[Ashcroft v. ACLU]]'', which held that the [[Child Online Protection Act]] might (or might not) be constitutional. The government was enjoined from enforcing it, pending further proceedings in the lower courts.<ref>''[[Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/00-1293.html 535 U.S. 564 (2002)]. Findlaw.</ref> Thomas wrote concurrences in ''[[McIntyre v.

Playboy Entertainment Group]]'' (2000).

In ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]],'' Thomas wrote: "It may well be the case that anything that would violate the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] Establishment Clause would actually violate the Free Exercise Clause, further calling into doubt the utility of incorporating the Establishment Clause."<ref>{{Citation|last=Thomas|title=Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v.

Thomas says "it makes little sense to incorporate the Establishment Clause" ''vis-à-vis'' the states by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref name="Elk">''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/02-1624.html 542 U.S. 1] (2004). Thomas wrote: "It may well be the case that anything that would violate the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] Establishment Clause would actually violate the Free Exercise Clause, further calling into doubt the utility of incorporating the Establishment Clause."</ref>

==== Second Amendment ====
Thomas agreed with the judgment in ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]'' (2010) that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to keep and bear arms]] is applicable to state and local governments, but Thomas wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]] rather than as a fundamental right under the [[due process]] clause. The four justices in the [[plurality opinion]] specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, "declin[ing] to disturb" the holding in the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'', which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.<ref>Ost, Harriet. "[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/06/28/US-Supreme-Court-Chicagos-gun-ban-struck-down/UPI-18071277761369 U.S. Supreme Court: Chicago's gun ban struck down]", [[United Press International]] (June 28, 2010).</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf|title=McDonald v. Chicago slip opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court|access-date=May 18, 2020}}</ref>

Since 2010, Thomas has dissented from denial of certiorari in several Second Amendment cases. He would have voted to grant certiorari in ''Friedman v. City of Highland Park'' (2015), which upheld bans on certain semi-automatic rifles, ''Jackson v. San Francisco'' (2014), which upheld trigger lock ordnances similar to those struck down in ''Heller'', ''[[Peruta v. San Diego County]]'' (2016), which upheld restrictive [[concealed carry]] licensing in California, and ''Silvester v. Becerra'' (2017), which upheld waiting periods for firearm purchasers who have already passed background checks and already own firearms. He was joined by Justice Scalia in the first two, and by Justice Gorsuch in ''Peruta''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-133_7l48.pdf|title=Friedman v.

Thomas dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case ''Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives'' (2019), a case challenging the Donald Trump administration's ban on [[bump fire|bump stocks]]. Only Thomas and Neil Gorsuch publicly dissented.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040519zr_6k47.pdf |title=Guedes, Damien, et al. v. Bureau of Alcohol, et al.|date=April 5, 2019 |website=supremecourt.gov |access-date=June 29, 2019}}</ref>

==== Fourth Amendment ====
In cases regarding the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which prohibits unreasonable [[search and seizure|searches and seizures]], Thomas often favors police over [[defendant]]s. For example, his opinion for the court in ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the court in ''[[Samson v. California]]'', permitting random searches on [[parole]]es. He dissented in the case ''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'', which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the case was controlled by the court's decision in ''[[Coolidge v. New Hampshire]]''. In ''[[Indianapolis v. Edmond]]'', Thomas described the court's extant case law as having held that "suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops." Although he expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly, he concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.<ref>''[[Indianapolis v. Edmond]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/99-1030.html 531 U.S. 32 (2000)]. Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.</ref> However, he was in the majority in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'', which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home, without a warrant, violated the Fourth Amendment.

In cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of [[in loco parentis]], which he defines as "parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order."<ref name="Safford" /> His dissent in ''[[Safford Unified School District v. Redding]]'' illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the ''Safford'' case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a [[strip search]] or the like.<ref name="Safford">''[[Safford Unified School District v. Redding]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/08-479.html 557 U. S. __ (2009). Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.]</ref> All of the justices, except Thomas, concluded that this search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. In contrast, Thomas said, "It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not"<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105896007&sc=fb&cc=fp "Court Says Strip Search of Ariz. Teenager Illegal"], [[Associated Press]] via [[National Public Radio|NPR]] (June 25, 2009).</ref> and that "reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed." Thomas said, "[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search."<ref name="Safford" />

==== Sixth Amendment ====
In ''[[Doggett v. United States]]'', the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right to a [[speedy trial]], finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.<ref name="Doggett">''[[Doggett v. United States]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/505/647.html 505 U.S. 647 (1992)]. Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.</ref> Thomas dissented, arguing that the purpose of the Speedy Trial Clause was to prevent "'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'" and that the case implicated neither.<ref name="Doggett" /> He cast the case instead as, "present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime." Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.<ref name="Doggett" /> Thomas wrote that dismissing the conviction "invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role."{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=123}}

In ''[[Garza v. Idaho]]'', Thomas and colleague [[Neil Gorsuch]], in a dissent, suggested ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' (1963), which established that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/politics/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-precedent.html|title=Precedent, Meet Clarence Thomas. You May Not Get Along.|first=Adam|last=Liptak|date=March 4, 2019|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

==== Eighth Amendment ====
Regarding capital punishment, Thomas was among the dissenters in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'' and ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'', which held that the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In ''[[Kansas v. Marsh]]'', his opinion for the court indicated a belief that the constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' and ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'', the 1976 case in which the court had reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In ''[[Hudson v. McMillian]]'', a prisoner had been beaten, garnering a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although these were not "serious injuries", the court believed, it held that "the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury."<ref name="Hudson">''[[Hudson v. McMillian]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=503&page=1 503 U.S. 1 (1992)].</ref> Dissenting, Thomas wrote that, in his view, "a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents."<ref name="Hudson" /> Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=119}} Thomas's opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority of the court, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, Thomas's opinion ignored "the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment".<ref name="Hudson" /> According to historian [[David Garrow]], Thomas's dissent in ''Hudson'' was a "classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by [[Felix Frankfurter]] and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him".<ref name="Garrow">[[David Garrow|Garrow, David]] (October 25, 2004), [http://www.davidgarrow-com.hb2hosting.net/File/DJG%202004%20TNRCTFoskettReview.pdf "Saving Thomas"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142836/http://www.davidgarrow-com.hb2hosting.net/File/DJG%202004%20TNRCTFoskettReview.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}, ''[[The New Republic]]''</ref> Thomas would later respond to the accusation "that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion."<ref name="Garrow" />

In ''[[United States v. Bajakajian]]'', Thomas joined with the court's more liberal bloc to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, {{usc|18|982}}(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was "grossly disproportional", and was a violation of the [[Excessive Fines Clause]].<ref>''[[United States v. Bajakajian]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=000&invol=96-1487 524 U.S. 321] (1998).</ref>

Thomas has written that in his view, the "Cruel and Unusual Punishment" clause of the Eighth Amendment "contains no proportionality principle", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as "cruel and unusual punishment" depends only on the sentence itself, and does not depend on what crime is being punished.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-08/14-proportionality.html|title=Proportionality|website=Justia Law}}</ref> He was concurring with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, under California's "Three-Strikes" law, for stealing some golf clubs, because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony, and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.

=== Equal protection and affirmative action ===
Thomas believes that the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In ''[[Adarand Constructors v. Peña]]'', for example, he wrote "there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race."<ref>''[[Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=u10252 515 U.S. 200] (1995).</ref>

In ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'', Thomas said that, in his view, "a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause."<ref>''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/539/244/case.html 539 U.S. 244] (2003).</ref> In ''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1]]'', Thomas joined the opinion of [[Chief Justice Roberts]], who concluded that "[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."<ref name="Parents">''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/05-908.html 551 U.S. 701] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704145153/http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/05-908.html |date=July 4, 2008 }} (2007).</ref> Concurring, Thomas wrote that "if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories," and charged that the dissent carried "similarities" to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.<ref name="Parents" />

In ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', he approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' dissent: "Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens."<ref>''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=02-241 539 U.S. 306] (2003).</ref> In a concurrence in ''[[Missouri v. Jenkins]]'' (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court "has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority."<ref name="MissouriVJenkins">{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-1823.ZC1.html|title=Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70 (1995)|work=cornell.edu}}</ref>

=== Abortion and family planning ===
Thomas has contended that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] does not address the issue of abortion.<ref name="online.wsj.com">[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119189308788652936 Yoo, John, Opinion (October 9, 2007) ''The Real Clarence Thomas''] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> In ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), the court reaffirmed ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. Thomas along with [[Byron White|Justice Byron White]] joined the dissenting opinions of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] and Justice Antonin Scalia. Rehnquist wrote that "[w]e believe ''Roe'' was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to ''stare decisis'' in constitutional cases."<ref name="Casey">''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/505/833.html 505 U.S. 833] (1992).</ref> Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not "a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States."<ref name="Casey" /> "[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it," Scalia wrote, "and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed."<ref name="Casey" />

In ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' (2000), the court struck down a state ban on [[partial-birth abortion]], concluding that it failed the "[[Undue burden standard|undue burden]]" test established in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Casey]]''. Thomas dissented, writing: "Although a State ''may'' permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State ''must'' do so."<ref name="cornell">''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/99-830.html 530 U.S. 914] (2000).</ref> He went on to criticize the reasoning of the ''Casey'' and ''Stenberg'' majorities: "The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States—a hostility that ''Casey'' purported to reject."

In ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' (2007), the court rejected a [[facial challenge]] to a federal ban on [[partial-birth abortion]].<ref name="Carhart">''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/05-380.html 550 U.S. 124] (2007).</ref> Concurring, Thomas asserted that the court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the constitution, but that the court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.<ref name="Carhart" /> Thomas added that the court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial-birth abortions: "[W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it."<ref name="Carhart" />

In December 2018, Thomas wrote a dissent when the Supreme Court voted against hearing cases brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to [[Planned Parenthood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/10/supreme-court-hamstrings-states-efforts-to-defund-planned-parenthood.html|title=Supreme Court hamstrings states' efforts to defund Planned Parenthood|last=Higgins|first=Tucker|date=December 10, 2018|website=cnbc.com|access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref> Justices Alito and Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent, arguing that the Supreme Court was “abdicating its judicial duty.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fox6now.com/2018/12/10/us-supreme-court-justices-wont-hear-states-appeal-over-planned-parenthood/|title=US Supreme Court Justices won't hear states' appeal over Planned Parenthood|date=December 10, 2018|website=FOX6Now.com|language=en|access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref>

Bell]]'' (1927), which upheld a forced sterilization law regarding people with mental disabilities. (In his opinion, Thomas quoted Margaret Sanger's support for contraception as a form of personal reproductive control which she considered superior to "the horrors of abortion and infanticide" (Sanger's wording, quoted by Thomas in his opinion)).<ref name = "theopinion">{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-483_3d9g.pdf |title=Kristina Box, Commissioner, Indiana Department of Health, et al. v.

In ''Box'', only Thomas, [[Sonia Sotomayor]], and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] publicly registered their votes.

In ''[[Romer v.

The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on "homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1995/1995_94_1039 |title=Romer v.

In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent in which he called the Texas statute prohibiting sodomy "uncommonly silly", a phrase originally used by [[Potter Stewart|Justice Stewart]]. He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law, as it was not a worthwhile use of "law enforcement resources" to police private sexual behavior. However, Thomas opined that the Constitution did not contain a right to privacy; therefore, he did not vote to strike the statute down. Accordingly, Thomas saw the issue as a matter for the states to decide for themselves.<ref>{{Cite court|litigants=Lawrence v.

In ''[[Bostock v.

(Thomas and Alito wrote a dissent together, and Kavanaugh wrote a separate dissent.) The 6–3 ruling's majority consisted of two [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-appointed justices, Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] and Justice [[Neil Gorsuch]], along with four liberal justices: [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[Stephen Breyer]], [[Sonia Sotomayor]], and [[Elena Kagan]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Supreme Court finds federal law bars LGBT discrimination in workplace|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/15/supreme-court-lgbt-rights-decision-319693|access-date=2020-06-15|website=POLITICO|language=en}}</ref>

In October 2020, Clarence Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but he wrote a separate opinion re-iterating his dissent from the ''[[Obergefell v.

== Approach to oral arguments ==
Thomas is well known for his reticence during oral argument. Beginning when he asked a question during a death penalty case on February 22, 2006, Thomas did not ask another question from the bench for more than ten years, finally asking a question on February 29, 2016, about a response to a question regarding whether persons convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence should be barred permanently from firearm possession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/29/justice-thomas-asks-questions-in-court-1st-time-in-10-years.html?intcmp=hpbt1|title=Justice Thomas asks questions in court, 1st time in 10 years|date=February 29, 2016}}</ref> He also had a nearly seven-year streak of not speaking at all in any context, finally breaking that silence on January 14, 2013, when he, a Yale Law graduate, was understood to have joked either that a law degree from Yale or from Harvard may be proof of incompetence.<ref name=liptak-nyt>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/us/politics/clarence-thomas-supreme-court.html|title=It's Been 10 Years.

Thomas has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.<ref name=liptak-nyt /> Thomas's speaking and listening habits also may have been influenced by his [[Gullah]] upbringing, during which time his English was relatively unpolished.<ref name="Gullah" /><ref name="Sotomayor and Thomas" /><ref>Patterson, Orlando (June 17, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/books/review/Patterson-t.html "Thomas Agonistes"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', p. 2.
