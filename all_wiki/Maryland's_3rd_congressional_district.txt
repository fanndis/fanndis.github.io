'''Maryland's 3rd congressional district''' comprises portions of [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel]] counties, as well as a significant part of the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. The seat is currently represented by [[John Sarbanes]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Landmarks in the district include [[Fort McHenry]] and the state capital, [[Annapolis]].{{citation needed|date = January 2018}}

Three people who represented Maryland in the [[United States Senate]] were also former representatives of the 3rd district, including [[Ben Cardin]], [[Barbara Mikulski]], and [[Paul Sarbanes]].{{citation needed|date = January 2018}}

==Historical boundaries and composition==
[[File:United States House of Representatives, Maryland District 3 map.png|thumb|The district, from 2003 to 2013]]
Maryland's 3rd district was one of the 61 districts that elected a representative to the [[1st United States Congress]]. It also has the distinction of being one of the few congressional districts that once included areas not currently in the state they are in.  The 3rd congressional district originally was composed of [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] and [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]].<ref>Parson, Stanley B., William W. Beach and Dan Hermann. ''United States Congressional Districts, 1788–1841'' (Westport: Greenwood Press, 1978) p. 8-9</ref>  At that point what is now [[Howard County, Maryland]] was in Anne Arundel County, and Prince George's County included the eastern half of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].

In 1792 the Maryland 3rd Congressional District was moved to include [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] and the eastern half of [[Frederick County, Maryland]].  The population was about 33,000.<ref>Parsons. ''Congressional Districts''. p. 42-43</ref>  However, the western portion of what is today [[Carroll County, Maryland]] was at this point in Frederick County, and the western half of the [[District of Columbia]] was in Montgomery County.  This latter fact explains why the district lost population even though it in theory did not experience redistricting after the 1800 census.  With the population of [[Georgetown, D. C.]] no longer in the district, its 1800 population was about 31,000.<ref>Parsons. ''Congressional Districts''. p. 93-94</ref>  At this point the 3rd was Maryland's least populous district, barely having half the population of the Baltimore City and County 5th district, which in 1800 had just above 59,000 inhabitants.<ref>Parsons. ''Congressional Districts''. p. 94</ref>

The boundaries remained the same after the 1810, 1820 and 1830 censuses.  While in 1820 the district had about 36,000 inhabitants its population had risen to 53,622 in 1830.<ref>Parsons. ''Congressional Districts'' p. 234, 318</ref>  With the formation of Carroll County in the 1830s as well as Maryland falling from 8 to 6 congressional seats, the boundaries of the 3rd Congressional District were drastically redrawn.  The only area that remained in the 3rd Congressional District was the part of Carroll County that had been in Frederick County.  The 3rd also included Baltimore County and the western half of the city of Baltimore.  Its new population was 69,923, 24.5% of whom were black.<ref>Parson, Stanley B., William W. Beach and Michael J. Durbin. ''United States Congressional Districts, 1843–1883'' (Westport: Greenwood Press, 1986) p. 16</ref>

In 1853 the 3rd district was redrawn again.  The new district consisted of Baltimore County except for the northern and western parts of the county and about the eastern third of the City of Baltimore.  The district now had a population of 95,729.<ref>Parsons. ''Con. Dis. 1843–1883'' p. 64</ref>  In the redistricting following the 1860 census, Maryland was reduced to five congressional districts.  The 3rd was moved so that it contained the part of Baltimore that had not been in the 3rd before 1863.  It now had a population of 130,040.<ref>Parsons. ''Con. Dis. 1843–1883'' p. 115</ref>  In 1873 the 3rd district was moved again, to be the east side of Baltimore.  It now had a population of 120,978.<ref>Parsons. ''Con. Dis. 1843–1883'' p. 177</ref>
