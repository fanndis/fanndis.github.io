'''Wen Jiabao''' (born 15 September 1942) is a retired Chinese politician who served as the [[List of premiers of China#Premiers of State Council of the People's Republic of China (1949-present)|sixth]] [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] and serving as China's [[head of government]] for a decade between 2003 and 2013. In his capacity as Premier, Wen was regarded as the leading figure behind Beijing's economic policy. From 2002 to 2012, he held membership in the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China]], the country's ''de facto'' top power organ, where he was ranked third out of nine members and headed by Party general secretary [[Hu Jintao]].

He worked as the chief of the [[General Office of the Communist Party of China|Party General Office]] between 1986 and 1993, and accompanied Party general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] to Tiananmen Square during the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]]. In 1998, he was promoted to the post of [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premier]] under Premier [[Zhu Rongji]], his mentor, and oversaw the broad portfolios of agriculture and finance.

Wen was dubbed "the people's premier" by both domestic and foreign media.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://in.rediff.com/news/2008/mar/16china.htm |title = Wen Jiabao re-elected Chinese Premier |date=16 March 2008 |website = Rediff.com }}</ref> Instead of concentrating on GDP growth in large cities and rich coastal areas, Wen advocated for advancing policies considered more favourable towards [[San Nong|farmers]] and migrant workers. Wen's government reduced agricultural taxes and pursued ambitious infrastructure projects. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, Wen's government injected [[Chinese economic stimulus program|four trillion yuan]] as part of a stimulus program.

Seen as the leading member of the reform wing of the Communist Party, Wen's family came under scrutiny by investigative journalists for having accumulated a massive fortune during his time in government, casting a cloud over his legacy shortly prior to his retirement.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/brother-wristwatch-and-grandpa-wen-chinese-kleptocracy | title=Brother Wristwatch and Grandpa Wen: Chinese Kleptocracy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/china-us-visit-213169 |title = China, World Leader in Graft}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/10/26/weibo-reaction-to-wen-jiabaos-corruption/ | title=Weibo reaction to Wen Jiabao's corruption}}</ref> He left office in 2013 and was succeeded by [[Li Keqiang]].

==Early life and rise to power==
A native of [[Beichen District]], Tianjin, Wen Jiabao went to the [[Tianjin Nankai High School|Nankai High School]] from which his predecessor premier [[Zhou Enlai]] graduated. He joined the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) in April 1965<ref name="mrtears">{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JF11Ad01.html|title=The rise and rise of China's Mr Tears|first=Maochun|last=Yu|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=10 August 2010|work=[[Asia Times]]}}</ref> and entered the work force in September 1967.

Wen has a background in engineering and holds a post-graduate degree from the [[Beijing Institute of Geology]].<ref name="mrtears"/> He studied [[geomechanics]] in Beijing and began his career in the geology bureau of [[Gansu]] province. From 1968–1978, he presided over the Geomechanics Survey Team under the Gansu Provincial Geological Bureau and head of its political section. Wen succeeded in office, rising as chief of the Gansu Provincial Geological Bureau and later as Vice-minister of Geology and Mineral Resources.

Wen was "discovered" by then-[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Hu Yaobang]], and joined the ranks of the Central Committee and Politburo. There was some public speculation after 1989 over whether Wen was closer to Hu Yaobang or Zhao Ziyang, but Wen implicitly confirmed that he was a protégé of Hu by the release of his 2010 article, "Recalling Hu Yaobang when I return to Xingyi".<ref>Wu Zhong. [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/LD21Ad02.html "Hu, Wen, and Why"].  ''Asia Times Online''. 21 April 2010. Retrieved 26 October 2011.</ref> After Wen was promoted to work in Beijing, he served as Chief of the Party's General Affairs Office, an organ that oversaw day-to-day operations of the party's leaders. He remained in the post for eight years.

Wen has built a network of patronage during his career. Throughout this period Wen was said to be a strong administrator and technocrat, having earned a reputation for meticulousness, competence, and a focus on tangible results. Outgoing Premier [[Zhu Rongji]] showed his esteem for Wen by entrusting him from 1998 with the task of overseeing agricultural, financial and environmental policies in the office of Vice-Premier, considered crucial as China prepared to enter the [[World Trade Organization]]. Wen served as Secretary of the [[Central Financial Work Commission]] from 1998 to 2002.  By the end of the 1990s Wen and [[Zhang Peili]] were the main investor and founder of [[Ping An Insurance]], which was established with the help of Hong Kong tycoon [[Cheng Yu-tung]]'s family through real estate firm [[New World Development]].<ref>''Next magazine''. Issue 1098. 24 March 2011. pg 82.</ref>

=== Survival of Tiananmen purge ===
Wen's most significant political recovery occurred after accompanying Zhao on his visit to students demonstrating in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square in 1989]]. Unlike Zhao, who was purged from the party days later for "grave insubordination" and lived under [[house arrest]] in Beijing until his death in January 2005, Wen survived the political aftermath of the demonstrations.<ref name="mrtears"/>
Wen Jiabao is the only Chief of the Party's General Affairs Office to have served under three General Secretaries:  [[Hu Yaobang]], [[Zhao Ziyang]], and [[Jiang Zemin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2003-03/18/content_785809.htm|title=::温式微笑将给中国带来什么？温家宝的中国命题::|agency=Xinhua News Agency|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523162242/http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2003-03/18/content_785809.htm|archivedate=23 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==First-term Premiership==
Wen entered the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China]], China's highest ruling council, in November 2002, ranked third out of nine members (After [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Wu Bangguo]]). During the transition of authority as Hu Jintao assumed the general secretary and presidency in November 2002 and March 2003 respectively, Wen's nomination as premier was confirmed by the [[National People's Congress]] with over 99% of the delegates' vote. After taking over as Premier, Wen oversaw the continuation of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] and has been involved in shifting national goals from economic growth at all costs to growth which also emphasizes more egalitarian wealth, along with other social goals, such as public health and education. Wen's broad range of experience and expertise, especially cultivated while presiding over agricultural policies under Zhu Rongji has been important as the "fourth generation" sought to revitalize the rural economy in regions left out by the past two decades of reform. In addition, the Chinese government under Wen has begun to focus on the social costs of economic development, which include damage to the environment and to workers' health. This more comprehensive definition of development was encapsulated into the idea of a ''[[xiaokang]] society''.

Initially regarded as quiet and unassuming, Wen is said to be a good communicator and is known as a "man of the people." Wen has appeared to make great efforts to reach out those who seem left out by two decades of stunning economic growth in rural and especially western China. Unlike [[Jiang Zemin]] and his protégés on the Politburo Standing Committee, who form the so-called "[[Shanghai clique]]", both Wen and Hu hail from, and have cultivated their political bases, in the vast Chinese interior. Many have noted the contrasts between Wen and Hu, "men of the people", and Jiang Zemin, the flamboyant, multilingual, and urbane former mayor of Shanghai, the country's most cosmopolitan city.

Like Hu Jintao, whose purported brilliance and photographic memory have facilitated his meteoric rise to power, Wen is regarded as well-equipped to preside over a vast bureaucracy in the world's most populated and perhaps rapidly changing nation. In March 2003, the usually self-effacing Wen was quoted as saying, "The former Swiss ambassador to China once said that my brain is like a computer", he said. "Indeed, many statistics are stored in my brain."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2836857.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Profile: Wen Jiabao | date=5 December 2003 | accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref>

Mild-tempered and conciliatory,<ref name="mrtears"/> especially compared to his predecessor, the tough, straight-talking Zhu Rongji, Wen's consensual management style has enabled him to generate a great deal of good will, but has also created some opponents who are in support of tougher policy decisions. Notably, Wen was widely known to have clashed with then-Shanghai party chief [[Chen Liangyu]] over the central government's policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voachinese.com/a/a-21-w2006-09-27-voa15-63056307/1044955.html|title=陈良宇倒台应有中共权力斗争背景|website=美国之音}}</ref>

Wen was involved in two major episodes involving [[public health]]. In early 2003, he was involved in ending the official inaction over the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] crisis. On 1 December 2004, he became the first major Chinese official to publicly address the problem of AIDS, which has devastated parts of [[Yunnan]] and [[Henan]] and threatens to be a major burden on Chinese development.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Yanzhong|url=http://www.asianperspective.org/articles/v30n1-d.pdf|title=The politics of HIV/AIDS in China|volume=30|issue=1|year=2006|pages=95–125|journal=Asian Perspectives|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725020808/http://www.asianperspective.org/articles/v30n1-d.pdf|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=dmy-all}} {{rp|96, 101, 105, 117}}</ref> Since May 2004, Wen made various visits to communities devastated by AIDS, trips shown prominently on national media. By showing these actions, Wen displayed an effort to reverse years of what many activists have described as a policy of denial and inaction. Furthermore, Wen is concerned about the health and safety of previous [[drug addict]]s; since March 2004, Wen had visited several drug addict treatment facilities in southern China and addressed the issue to the patients in person, recognizing that AIDS is more likely to be spread by drug abuse and the reuse of hypodermic syringes than by sexual contact.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pisani|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Wisdom of Whores: Bureaucrats, Brothels and the Business of AIDS|page=76|url=http://www.wisdomofwhores.com/}}</ref>

Wen was known to conduct visits to relatively poor areas of China's countryside randomly to avoid elaborate preparations to appease officials and hide the real situation, which is done often in China. At committee meetings of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], Wen made it clear that the rural wealth disparity problem must be addressed. Along with general secretary Hu Jintao, the government focused on the "[[Three Rural Issues]]", namely, agriculture, the countryside, and farmers, and emphasized these core areas as requiring further work and development. The Hu-Wen administration abolished the thousand year old agricultural tax entirely in 2005, a bold move that significantly changed the rural economic model. But despite these initiatives, Wen has been criticized for allowing the urban-rural gap to actually increase during his tenure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chinanalyst.com/archives/368|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010210113/http://chinanalyst.com/archives/368|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-10-10|title=Currency manipulation, bloggers and American politicians|publisher=chinanalyst.com}}</ref> 

Like Zhu Rongji, Wen is generally seen as a popular communist official with the Chinese public. His attitude is seemingly sincere and warm, triggering comparisons with former premier Zhou Enlai. Wen spent [[Chinese New Year]] in 2005 with a group of coal miners in a [[Shanxi]] coal mine. To many, Wen has gained the image of being the "people's premier", a populist, and an ordinary Chinese citizen who knows and understands ordinary people's needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/simp/hi/newsid_6410000/newsid_6418800/6418883.stm|title=官员的施政个性|publisher=BBC}}</ref> In an annual meeting of the Chinese Authors Association, Wen spoke for over two hours to the delegates without looking at script. To foreign media, Wen was also the highest figure in the Chinese government to give free press conferences, often facing politically sensitive and difficult questions regarding subjects such as [[Taiwan Independence]], [[Tibetan independence movement|Tibetan independence]] and [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights]].

In December 2003, Wen visited the United States for the first time. During the trip, Wen was able to get President [[George W. Bush]] to issue what many saw as a mild rebuke to the then [[President of the Republic of China]] (Taiwan), [[Chen Shui-bian]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/east/12/10/taiwan.us.china/index.html|title=Chen stands up to Bush|date=10 October 2003|accessdate=8 August 2010|publisher=CNN|location=Taipei|quote=Bush's warning [against holding a referendum that could antagonize China] – made after he met Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao at the White House – was described by analysts as the toughest American language used against a Taiwanese leader in decades.}}</ref> Wen has also been on visits to Canada and Australia, mostly on economic issues. Wen also visited Japan in April 2007 in what was termed the "de-thawing journey", where he characterized the relationship between the Asian powers as for "mutual benefit". He also met with Emperor [[Akihito]] and played baseball.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wgwzKqVWtoC&pg=PA198|title=China's struggle for status: the realignment of international relations|first=Yong|last=Deng|date=28 April 2008|page=198|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-88666-6}}</ref>

On 15 March 2005, after the [[anti-secession law]] was passed, by a majority of 2,896 to nil, with two abstentions by the [[National People's Congress]], Wen said: "We don't wish for foreign intervention, but we are not afraid of it." as an allusion to the United States' [[political status of Taiwan|stance on Taiwan]]. That earned him a long round of applause that was rare even by Chinese standards.

On 5 March 2007, Wen announced plans to increase the military budget. By the end of 2007 the military budget rose 17.8 percent from the previous year's 45&nbsp;billion dollars, creating tension with the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070305/ts_afp/chinacongressnpc_070305190447|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308092521/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070305/ts_afp/chinacongressnpc_070305190447|url-status=dead|title=Budget Increase|archivedate=8 March 2007}}</ref>

There were rumours about Wen's retirement and reputed clashes with former Shanghai party chief [[Chen Liangyu]] before the party's [[17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|17th Party Congress]]. Some sources suggested that Wen would ask to retire due to fatigue. Ultimately, Wen stayed on the Premier job, and was responsible for the drafting of the important speech delivered by Party general secretary Hu Jintao outlining China's direction in the next five years.

In January 2008, while during the midst of [[2008 Chinese winter storms|severe snowstorms]], Premier Wen made his way south and visited train stations in [[Changsha]] and [[Guangzhou]], addressing the public while calming their mood for long train delays.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/world/asia/28iht-china.1.9543336.html|title=Severe snowstorms batter China|author=French, Howard W.|date=28 January 2008|accessdate=10 August 2010|work=International Herald Tribune|location=Shanghai}}</ref>

== Second-term Premiership ==
[[File:Wen Jiabao 09.JPG|thumb|Wen visiting [[Tsinghua University]] in May 2009.]]

Wen Jiabao was appointed to a second five-year term as premier on 16 March 2008, leading efforts to cool soaring inflation and showcase the country to the world at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. He received fewer votes in favour than he did in 2003, a sign that the premiership can create enemies, even in the mere formalities of China's electoral system. Wen faced grave economic challenges as the world became increasingly affected by the U.S. economic crisis. Social stability and regional activism in China's restive hinterland regions also dominated Wen's policy agenda.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/16/china.politics.ap/index.html Wen gets second term as China's premier]. CNN, 16 March 2008</ref> On 18 March 2008, during the press conference after the [[2008 National People's Congress]], Wen toed the government line in blaming supporters of the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] for [[2008 Tibetan unrest|violence in Tibet]], and said Chinese security forces exercised restraint in confronting rioting and unrest in the streets of [[Lhasa]].<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/18/tibet.unrest/index.html Dalai Lama 'to resign' if violence worsens]. CNN, 18 March 2008</ref> Wen acted as the spokesman of the Chinese government during the [[2008 unrest in Tibet]] and refused to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and his followers, unless they chose to "give up all separatist activities." On 12 November 2010, during the [[2010 Asian Games opening ceremony]] in Guangzhou, Wen became the first non-head of state to open the Asian Games.

In his final address as China's prime minister Wen warned of the nation's growing divisions between rich and poor, the hazards of unchecked [[environmental degradation]] and the risks posed by unbalanced economic growth.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/world/asia/chinas-wen-gives-final-speech-as-prime-minister.html "Chinese Premier’s Parting Words Include Warning"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 March 2013</ref>

=== Response to 2008 Sichuan earthquake ===

{{See also|2008 Sichuan earthquake#Rescue efforts}}
Premier Wen Jiabao's popularity was boosted significantly when he went to the disaster area of the Sichuan a mere few hours after the disaster occurred.<ref name="mrtears"/> He declared on national television that survivors are to be rescued as long as there is "a glimmer of hope". He was named the General Commander of the Earthquake Relief Efforts Committee immediately following the disaster. Following his visits to the area, images of the Premier were displayed on national media, numerous videos popped up on Chinese video sites making comparisons with former Premier Zhou Enlai, a largely popular figure who was also dubbed the "People's Premier". While party leaders are often shown on state television looking rather stiff and sitting motionlessly, Wen's on-site image and candid nature attracted a large popular following of Chinese citizens.<ref name=iht>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/05/16/asia/AS-GEN-China-Earthquake-Hero-Premier.php "China's 'Grandpa Wen' widely admired for work to rally victims in hard-hit earthquake areas"]. ''International Herald Tribune'', 16 May 2008</ref>

In addition, there was speculation on internet forums as well as foreign media about the availability of the scientific prediction of the 2008 earthquake, and Wen was quoted as the only high-ranking Chinese leader to try to announce the scientific prediction and made it public, but was somehow prevented by other members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bbs.sina.com/viewthread.php?tid=46065&extra=page%3D1|title=开放杂志：中共政治局隐瞒四川地震预警|publisher=Sina BBS|accessdate=26 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918162548/http://bbs.sina.com/viewthread.php?tid=46065&extra=page%3D1|archive-date=18 September 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== 2009 NPC ===
Before the [[2009 National People's Congress]] convened, on 28 February, Premier Wen Jiabao went online on [[video chat]] to answer queries hosted by China's official government website gov.cn and the official [[Xinhua News Agency]]. During the session Wen openly advocated for transparency of the government and remarked that he was somewhat nervous about the occasion. He received a wide range of questions from large numbers of online Chinese netizens and chose to answer selected questions about prominent economic issues, such as global financial breakdown.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/04/AR2009030401893.html|title=In Crisis, China Vows Openness|author=Cha, Ariana Eunjung|date=15 March 2009|accessdate=10 August 2010|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

At the Congress, Wen also passed on a message of reassurance that GDP growth would not dip below 8% in 2009. He did not introduce a new stimulus package, and played down speculation that part of the 1.18&nbsp;trillion RMB central government spending was not going directly into the economy. He also expressed concern about the security of Beijing's holdings in U.S. treasury debt. In a more unusual gesture, Wen also expressed interest in visiting [[Taiwan]], stating he would "crawl there if [he] could not walk".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/13/content_11005631.htm|title=Chinese Premier says would 'crawl to Taiwan' even if he could not walk|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=10 August 2010|agency=Xinhua News Agency|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722085038/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/13/content_11005631.htm|archivedate=22 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Foreign policy ===
[[File:Wen Jiabao at World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009.jpg|right|thumb|Wen at the 2009 [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos.]]
Wen Jiabao played a prominent role advancing China's foreign policy positions, and became increasingly visible on the world stage as China's economic power expanded. He went on an official working visit to North Korea on 4 October 2009, the first time a Chinese Premier has visited North Korea since [[Li Peng]]'s visit in 1991.<ref>{{Cite news|title=China's Wen arrives in Pyongyang, told N.

In December, in what was seen as a mild rebuke of Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] during the latter's working visit to China, Wen stated, "This is your first trip to China and this is the first meeting between the Chinese Premier and the Canadian Prime Minister in almost five years.

== Political views ==
Domestic and foreign media variously described Wen as "[[populism|populist]]" and in touch with the needs of ordinary people. On most social issues Wen seemed to be moderate, with his brand of policies based around societal harmony as prescribed by the [[Scientific Development Concept]], the leading ideology of the administration.

In the first term of his Premiership Wen's attitudes towards political reform seemed ambivalent. He remarked that "the socialist system will continue in China for the next 100 years",<ref>Spencer, Richard (28 February 2007). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/28/wchina28.xml China promises socialism for 100 years]. ''The Daily Telegraph''</ref> although later, in a press conference at the [[2007 National People's Congress]], he stated that "democracy is one of the basic goals of the socialist system". Furthermore, in an interview in September 2008, Wen acknowledged that the democratic system in China needs to be improved, where the power "truly belongs to the people" through the construction of an independent judicial system and for the government to accept criticism from the people.<ref name=20080928cnntranscript>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0809/28/fzgps.01.html Interview with Wen Jiabao], CNN, 28 September 2008.</ref> Wen, seen as a former ally of Premier [[Zhao Ziyang]], was likely supportive of the latter's political rehabilitation; however, he rarely mentioned Zhao publicly during his premiership. When asked by CNN whether or not China will liberalize for free elections in the next 25 years, Wen stated that it would be "hard to predict." On the [[political status of Taiwan|subject of Taiwan]], he reputedly believed in gradual negotiations. On the subject of Tibet, he toed the party line in condemning the exiled Dalai Lama for inciting "separatist violence".

Xinhua published articles in early 2007 on the direction of national development. The authorship of the articles was attributed separately to Wen Jiabao, particularly 26 February piece "Our Historical Tasks at the Primary Stage of Socialism and Several Issues Concerning China's Foreign Policy". The article advanced Wen's "peace doctrine" in global affairs, as well as what appeared to be inclinations towards fostering [[social democracy]] and advocacy of [[universal values]]. This was suspected as a sign that Wen has some differing viewpoints to the official party line – that values are relativistic and that "Chinese values" are not necessarily the same as "Western values," and that universal values is thus an empty concept. The debate continues to rage in Chinese political circles today, with [[Chinese New Left|neo-leftist]] thinkers such as [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] President [[Chen Kuiyuan]] criticizing Wen's advocacy of universal values, saying that it relegates Chinese values and thinking as an inferior alternative to supposedly more "correct" Western norms.<ref name="dw2">{{cite web|title=中国再起左右两派论战 (China's Left-Right Divide Resurfaces)|url=http://politics.dwnews.com/news/2010-06-09/56068855.html|publisher=Duowei|accessdate=11 June 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612215838/http://politics.dwnews.com/news/2010-06-09/56068855.html|archivedate=12 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Wen is perceived by some observers as a liberal voice in China's ruling elite. Wen has openly talked about democracy and increased freedoms in his speeches and interviews with foreign correspondents, although much of it was deemed "sensitive" commentary and censored in state media. Wen remarked that "someone who speaks is not a criminal, someone who listens is duly warned" ({{zh|c=言者无罪，闻者足戒}}, ''which alludes to the classical work [[Shi Jing]]'') at an internal party conference in 2009, an event reported on Xinhua and other state networks. His remarks triggered debate from netizens, as it seemed to contravene the practices of the Communist Party, particularly in its suppression of dissent. Analysts noted that Wen's message was aimed at party members, and not necessarily the general public because Wen believes freedom of speech has deteriorated since Hu Jintao's accession to power and has negatively affected China's political landscape and international reputation.<ref name=RFA>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/wen-11202009224215.html|title=温家宝"言者无罪"引热议 (Discussions over Wen Jiabao's Comments)|date=21 November 2009|publisher=[[Radio Free Asia]]|language=zh|accessdate=29 November 2009}}</ref> His comments also ostensibly addressed the pervasive "fake-talking" present in Chinese political circles, in an attempt to curb systemic and institutional woes stemming from officials who are afraid to speak the truth.<ref name=RFA/>

Wen has progressively amped up his liberal rhetoric as his Premiership continued, remarking in August 2010 that "Without political reform, China may lose what it has already achieved through economic restructuring".<ref name="ap2">{{cite news|last=Bodeen|first=Christopher|title=China's Wen inspiring debate with calls for reform|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101014/ap_on_re_as/as_china_debating_democracy|agency=Associated Press |newspaper=Yahoo!}}</ref> Wen's comments were largely censored in state media, but he gained support from a group of some 23 party elders in October, who denounced the authorities' censorship of Wen's remarks in an open letter to the [[National People's Congress]].<ref name="an">{{cite news|last=Wang|first=Zhicheng|title=Party members call for an end to press censorship, backing Wen Jiabao|url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Party-members-call-for-an-end-to-press-censorship,-backing-Wen-Jiabao-19718.html|publisher=Asianews.it|date=14 October 2010}}</ref> In an interview with [[Fareed Zakaria]] on [[CNN]]'s [[Global Public Square]] television program aired in 2008, Wen made the following statement: "I have summed up my political ideals into the following four sentences.  To let everyone lead a happy life with dignity.  To let everyone feel safe and secure.  To let the society be one with equity and justice.  And to let everyone have confidence in the future.  In spite of the various discussions and views in the society, and in spite of some resistance, I will act in accordance with these ideals unswervingly, and advance within the realm of my capabilities political restructuring.

== Public image and political influence ==
Wen has been described as a populist by most observers{{who|date=October 2017}}. His quick responses and visits to the scenes of various disasters, including the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], has earned him a considerable reputation as an approachable leader in touch with the experiences of the masses.<ref name=iht/> Wen engages regularly with locals on his trips to various provinces domestically as well as foreign visits; he played baseball and badminton with [[People's Republic of China–Japan relations|Japanese]] and [[People's Republic of China – South Korea relations|South Korean]] citizens during visits to those countries. "Whether taking a stroll or swimming, it puts me at ease both mentally and physically and helps me handle my heavy workload," Wen had remarked.<ref name="dt">{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|title=Wen Jiabao goes for a jog to take his mind off negotiations|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/7790303/Wen-Jiabao-goes-for-a-jog-to-take-his-mind-off-negotiations.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=31 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

[[File:Wen Jiabao - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wen at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], Switzerland in 2009]]

Wen's public image has been criticized by Chinese dissident [[Yu Jie]], who charged that Wen's rhetoric is insincere and empty. Dissidents such as Yu allege that Wen's parade of appearances on Chinese media is a carefully managed [[public relations]] campaign designed to distract people from real issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/7949426/Book-by-Chinese-dissident-brands-Wen-Jiabao-a-fraud.html|title=Book by Chinese dissident brands Wen Jiabao a fraud|first=Peter|last=Foster|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=17 August 2010}}</ref> They say that through use of Wen's charisma, the government hopes to showcase cosmetic solutions to much larger, systemic issues in order to placate public opinion. They also point out that Wen's words are rarely translated into deeds. On the other hand, [[Li Datong]], a pro-democracy advocate, in an interview with the [[Associated Press]], stated that "among the top Chinese leaders, who else speaks about democracy? Who else speaks about universal values and freedom?... Wen is the only one." Li believes that Wen is genuinely calling for democratic reform but he is powerless to make major decisions on the matter due to internal opposition.<ref name="AP">{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2010/08/09/book_says_chinese_premier_is_no_reformist/|first=Gillian|last=Wong|agency=Associated Press  |title=Book says Chinese premier is no reformist|date=9 August 2010|work=Boston Globe}}</ref> Wen's family members have also been subject to gossip and scrutiny outside of [[mainland China]].

When he was the head of the [[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]], Wen Jiabao was considered to be one of the most powerful statesmen in the world. In 2006, he was named to the [[Time 100]] list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/time100/|title=The 2006 TIME 100|work=Time|year=2006}}</ref> In 2009, Wen was named one of ten people and the only non-American in a list compiled by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] of people who shaped the [[Economy of the United States|U.S. economy]] the most since 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/ten-powerful-economic-figures-decade/story?id=9169066&page=3|title=Page 3: Ten Most Powerful Economic Figures of the Decade|publisher=ABC News}}</ref> Wen also topped a list of "10 leaders to watch" in 2010 released 19 January by [[Eurasia Group]], a global political risk research and consulting firm.

== Personal life and family wealth ==
Wen Jiabao is married to [[Zhang Peili]], whom he met while working as a government geologist in [[Gansu]]. Zhang is a jewellery expert and has played a prominent role in the nation's diamond trade. She rarely appears with Wen in public. In October 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Wen's relatives have controlled financial assets worth at least US$2.7&nbsp;billion during his time as Premier.<ref>David Barboza, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html?_r=1& "Billions in Hidden Riches for Family of Chinese Leader"], ''The New York Times'', 25 October 2012.

Wen is said to have an [[introvert]]ed personality.{{fact|date=May 2018}} He has stated that his one regret so far in life was never having learned to drive a [[manual transmission]] car.
