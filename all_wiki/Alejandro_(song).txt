"'''Alejandro'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. It was released as the third single from her third [[extended play|EP]], ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009). Co-written and produced by Gaga and [[RedOne|Nadir "RedOne" Khayat]], it was inspired by her "Fear of Men Monster". The singer bids farewell to her lovers over mid-tempo [[synth-pop]] music with a [[Europop]] beat.

Contemporary critics predominantly gave "Alejandro" positive reviews and noted that it takes influence from the pop acts [[ABBA]] and [[Ace of Base]]. The song charted in the United Kingdom and Hungary due to digital sales following the album's release. Upon release, "Alejandro" charted again in the United Kingdom as well as in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United States while topping the Czech, Finnish, Mexican, Venezuelan, Polish, Russian, Bulgarian, and Romanian charts. "Alejandro" became Gaga's seventh successive single to reach the top-ten of the US  [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

The accompanying music video was directed by fashion photographer [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]] and inspired by Gaga's love for her gay friends and admiration of gay love. Within the video, Gaga dances with a group of soldiers in a cabaret, interspersed with scenes of Gaga as a nun swallowing a rosary and near-naked men holding machine guns. The music video was controversial and received mixed reviews. Critics complimented its idea and dark nature while the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] criticized Gaga for alleged [[blasphemy]], despite Klein dismissing the idea and claiming that the scene in question (the swallowing of [[Rosary beads]]) was Gaga's "desire to take in the Holy".<ref name="holy"/> Gaga performed the song on the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' and has performed it on all dates of [[The Monster Ball Tour]] and on all subsequent tours to date.

The song opens with the main melody from the Hungarian piece "[[Csárdás (Monti)|Csárdás]]" by Italian composer [[Vittorio Monti]] played on violin,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philharmonicsociety.org/DeansBlog/blog.aspx?i=444|title=Music Monday: Vittorio Monti's Czardas|publisher=[[Royal Philharmonic Society]]|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}</ref> as a distressed Gaga (speaking in a Spanish accent) states: "I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me/But I just can't be with you like this anymore, Alejandro." The track then changes to a stomping Europop beat. Gaga bids her ex-lovers farewell with a bitter-hearted pre-chorus where she sings: "You know that I love you, boy/Hot like Mexico, rejoice!/At this point I've got to choose/Nothing to lose." By the end of the song, the three protagonists—Alejandro, Fernando, and Roberto—are bidden farewell by Gaga.<ref name="bbrev"/>

According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], the song is set in the [[time signature]] of common time, with a moderate [[tempo (music)|tempo]] of 99 [[beats per minute]]. It is composed in the key of [[B minor]] with Gaga's vocal range spanning from [[F-sharp major|F{{sharp}}<sub>3</sub>]] to [[G minor|G<sub>4</sub>]]. The song has a basic sequence of Bm–D–F{{sharp}}m as its [[chord progression]].<ref name="sheet">{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0080611|title=Lady Gaga 'Alejandro' Sheet Music|publisher=Musicnotes.com.

Originally, "[[Dance in the Dark]]" was planned to be released as the third single from ''The Fame Monster'', as a preference of Gaga's record label. The singer's own choice, "Alejandro", initially saw poor reception in terms of radio play, thereby was not seen as a viable choice for a single. A quarrel then arose between Gaga and her label where "Alejandro" was ultimately chosen to be released. Through her account on [[Twitter]], the singer remarked on the decision, "Alejandro is on the radio. Fuck it sounds so good, we did it little monsters."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/gaga-still-releasing-alejandro-in-us_1137892|title=Lady Gaga – Gaga Still Releasing Alejandro In U.S.|magazine=[[Contactmusic.com]]|date=April 5, 2010|accessdate=April 6, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407014203/http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/gaga-still-releasing-alejandro-in-us_1137892|archivedate=April 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/lady-gaga/news/202724-lady-gaga-elton-john|title=Lady GaGa Will Release Alejandro As Next Single|publisher=MTV News|date=April 6, 2010|accessdate=April 16, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414115105/http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/lady-gaga/news/202724-lady-gaga-elton-john|archivedate=April 14, 2011}}</ref> The single was officially sent to radio on April 20, 2010 in the United States.<ref name="fmqb1">{{cite web|url=http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=69239#210|title=Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings: 4/20 Mainstream|work=[[FMQB]]|accessdate=October 24, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101141712/http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=69239|archivedate=November 1, 2009}}</ref>

A snippet of the video was shown on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on June 1, 2010.

The video was also heavily compared to works by 1980s pop artists like Madonna and [[Janet Jackson]].

He noted Gaga's short, cropped hair and black blazer "set against the stark, post-industrialist mood of the ["Alejandro"] clip" was similar to "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]" (1989) and the machine-gun bra in the video was similar to the cone bra Madonna sported in "Vogue."

===Religious iconography===
[[File:Katy_Perry_-_Part_Of_Me_Australian_Premiere_-_June_2012_(2).jpg|thumb|upright|Fellow pop singer [[Katy Perry]] criticized Gaga's use of "blasphemous" religious imagery in the "Alejandro" music video.]]
"Alejandro" created a media uproar after the release of the video because of its use of religious imagery. One of the most discussed scenes in the video was when Gaga, dressed in a latex nun outfit, swallowed rosary beads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1641196/does-lady-gagas-alejandro-video-go-far.jhtml|title=Does Lady Gaga's 'Alejandro' Video Go Too Far?|first=Mawuse|last=Ziegbe|date=July 9, 2010|publisher=MTV.

Thus at the end of the film, she is portrayed again in her nun's habit. Klein added that the significance behind her mouth and eyes disappearing was "because she is withdrawing her senses from the world of evil and going inward towards prayer and contemplation." He added that the scene where Gaga devours the rosary beads was her act of [[Death or departure of the gods|theophagy]], the desire to consume the body of God, the rosary being symbolic of the Holy.<ref name="holy">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1641149/20100609/lady_gaga.jhtml|accessdate=June 10, 2010|date=June 9, 2010|publisher=MTV News|title=Lady Gaga’s ‘Alejandro’ Director Defends Video’s Religious Symbolism|last=Montgomery|first=James|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612155908/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1641149/20100609/lady_gaga.jhtml|archivedate=June 12, 2010}}</ref>

Many critics agreed that the religious imagery was a calculated move by Gaga to create controversy.<ref name="offense"/> Simon Voxick-Levinson from ''Entertainment Weekly'' felt that the move was calculated, saying, "Gaga wants to offend people. She's a provocateur. Gaga would probably be disappointed if no one was offended by her latest video. She's doing that stuff for a reason." He did not think that the risks were very original or as exciting as the ones in "Telephone." "The risks that she was taking [...] were easier targets [...] It's a little bit been there, done that," he said.<ref name="offense"/> ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s Jon Caramanica thought the controversy was Gaga's attempt to take the "Queen of Pop" throne. He said, ""I'm sure she'd say she loves Madonna ... but I also think she's saying, 'This [Queen of Pop title] is mine.' And also, like, 'I'm murdering you with my own style. I've learned this. I know how to do this ... And look how flawlessly I do it.'" He did feel, however, that the religious imagery was obvious and lazy: "Even the worst provocation is going to succeed. She got what she wanted."<ref name="offense">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1641345/lady-gaga-wants-offend-with-alejandro-experts.jhtml|accessdate=November 28, 2011|date=June 11, 2010|publisher=MTV News|title=Lady Gaga Wants To Offend With 'Alejandro,' Experts Say|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105105819/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1641345/lady-gaga-wants-offend-with-alejandro-experts.jhtml|archivedate=November 5, 2012}}</ref> Singer [[Katy Perry]] took to her [[Twitter]] account and wrote, "Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling fart jokes."
