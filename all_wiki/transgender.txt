Despite the distinction between sexual orientation and gender, throughout history the [[LGBT|gay, lesbian, and bisexual]] subculture was often the only place where gender-variant people were socially accepted in the [[gender role]] they felt they belonged to; especially during the time when legal or medical [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] was almost impossible. This acceptance has had a complex history. Like the wider world, the gay community in [[Western culture|Western societies]] did not generally distinguish between sex and [[gender identity]] until the 1970s, and often perceived gender-variant people more as homosexuals who behaved in a gender-variant way than as gender-variant people in their own right.

Most mental health professionals recommend therapy for internal conflicts about gender identity or discomfort in an assigned gender role, especially if one desires to [[transitioning (transgender)|transition]].

Transgender people may meet the criteria for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria "only if [being transgender] causes distress or disability."<ref name="apatransgenderanswersdisorder">[http://www.apa.org/topics/sexuality/transgender.aspx Answers to Your Questions About Transgender Individuals and Gender Identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615045832/http://apa.org/topics/sexuality/transgender.aspx|date=2010-06-15}} report from the website of the American Psychological Association - "Is being transgender a mental disorder?"</ref> This distress may manifest as depression or inability to work and form healthy relationships with others. This diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that all transgender people suffer from GD, which has confused transgender people and those who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing inner frustration or impairing their functioning do not suffer from GD. Moreover, GD is not necessarily permanent and is often resolved through therapy or transitioning.  Feeling oppressed by the negative attitudes and behaviors of such others as legal entities does not indicate GD. GD does not imply an opinion of immorality; the psychological establishment holds that people with any kind of mental or emotional problem should not receive stigma. The solution for GD is whatever will alleviate suffering and restore functionality; this solution often, but not always, consists of undergoing a [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]].<ref name="Brown&Rounsley" />

Clinical training lacks relevant information needed in order to adequately help transgender clients, which results in a large number of practitioners who are not prepared to sufficiently work with this population of individuals.<ref name="L. Carroll, P.J. Gilroy, and J. Ryan">{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=L.|last2=Gilroy|first2=P.J.|last3=Ryan|first3=J.|year=2002|title=Transgender issues in counselor education|journal=Counselor Education and Supervision|volume=41|issue=3|pages=233–242|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6978.2002.tb01286.x}}</ref> Many mental healthcare providers know little about transgender issues. Those who seek help from these professionals often educate the professional without receiving help.<ref name="Brown&Rounsley" /> This solution usually is good for transsexual people but is not the solution for other transgender people, particularly [[non-binary gender|non-binary]] people who lack an exclusively male or female identity. Instead, therapists can support their clients in whatever steps they choose to take to transition or can support their decision not to transition while also addressing their clients' sense of congruence between gender identity and appearance.<ref name="10.1177/0361684312442161" />

Acknowledgment of the lack of clinical training has increased; however, research on the specific problems faced by the transgender community in mental health has focused on diagnosis and clinicians' experiences instead of transgender clients' experiences.<ref name="H.E. Benson">{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=Kristen E|year=2013|title=Seeking support: Transgender client experiences with mental health services|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/226e2f3fef07af260e7b051ccd9f9ddb3a4ebafd|journal=Journal of Feminist Family Therapy|volume=25|issue=1|pages=17–40|doi=10.1080/08952833.2013.755081|s2cid=144491629}}</ref> Therapy was not always sought by transgender people due to mental health needs. Prior to the seventh version of the [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People|Standards of Care]] (SOC), an individual had to be diagnosed with gender identity disorder in order to proceed with hormone treatments or sexual reassignment surgery.  The new version decreased the focus on diagnosis and instead emphasized the importance of flexibility in order to meet the diverse health care needs of transsexual, transgender, and all gender-nonconforming people.<ref name="SOC">{{cite web|title=Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming people – 7th version|url=http://www.wpath.org/documents/Standards%20of%20Care%20V7%20-%202011%20WPATH.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303035205/http://www.wpath.org/documents/Standards%20of%20Care%20V7%20-%202011%20WPATH.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2012|accessdate=30 November 2014|website=The World Professional Association for Transgender Health}}</ref>

The reasons for seeking mental health services vary according to the individual. A transgender person seeking treatment does not necessarily mean their gender identity is problematic. The emotional strain of dealing with stigma and experiencing [[transphobia]] pushes many transgender people to seek treatment to improve their quality of life, as one trans woman reflected: "Transgendered individuals are going to come to a therapist and most of their issues have nothing to do, specifically, with being transgendered. It has to do because they've had to hide, they've had to lie, and they've felt all of this guilt and shame, unfortunately usually for years!"<ref name="H.E. Benson" /> Many transgender people also seek mental health treatment for depression and anxiety caused by the stigma attached to being transgender, and some transgender people have stressed the importance of acknowledging their gender identity with a therapist in order to discuss other quality-of-life issues.<ref name="H.E. Benson" /> Others regret having undergone the procedure and wish to [[detransition]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Shute|first=Joe|date=2 October 2017|title=The new taboo: More people regret sex change and want to 'detransition', surgeon says|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/the-new-taboo-more-people-regret-sex-change-and-want-to-detransition-surgeon-says|access-date=2 October 2017|website=National Post|publisher=Postmedia|quote=Dr. Miroslav Djordjevic says more people, particularly transgender women over 30, are asking for reversal surgery, yet their regrets remain taboo.}}</ref>

Problems still remain surrounding misinformation about transgender issues that hurt transgender people's mental health experiences. One trans man who was enrolled as a student in a psychology graduate program highlighted the main concerns with modern clinical training: "Most people probably are familiar with the term transgender, but maybe that's it. I don’t think I've had any formal training just going through [clinical] programs . . . I don’t think most [therapists] know. Most therapists{{snd}}Master's degree, PhD level{{snd}}they've had . . . one diversity class on GLBT issues. One class out of the huge diversity training. One class. And it was probably mostly about gay lifestyle."<ref name="H.E. Benson" /> Many health insurance policies do not cover treatment associated with gender transition, and numerous people are under- or uninsured, which raises concerns about the insufficient training most therapists receive prior to working with transgender clients, potentially increasing financial strain on clients without providing the treatment they need.<ref name="H.E. Benson" />  Many clinicians who work with transgender clients only receive mediocre training on gender identity, but introductory training on interacting with transgender people has recently been made available to health care professionals to help remove barriers and increase the level of service for the transgender population.<ref name="Hanssman, Morrison, & Russian">{{cite journal|last1=Hanssmann|first1=C.|last2=Morrison|first2=D.|last3=Russian|first3=E.|year=2008|title=Talking, gawking, or getting it done: Providing trainings to increase cultural and clinical competence for transgender and gender-nonconforming patients and clients|journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy|volume=5|pages=5–23|doi=10.1525/srsp.2008.5.1.5|s2cid=52025741}}</ref>

Requirements for these procedures vary from an explicit formal diagnosis of [[transsexualism]], to a diagnosis of [[gender identity disorder]], to a letter from a physician that attests the individual's gender transition or having established a different [[gender role]].<ref name="Greenberg">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUwOKayHVwcC&q=transgender+rights|title=Transgender Rights|publisher=Minnesota University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8166-4312-7|editor1-last=Currah|editor1-first=Paisley|pages=51–73|editor2-last=M.

Some feminists and feminist groups are supportive of transgender people, but others are not. Though [[second-wave feminism]] argued for the [[sex and gender distinction]], some feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity and the feminist cause; e.g., they believed that male-to-female transition abandoned or devalued female identity and that transgender people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes. Many transgender feminists, however, view themselves as contributing to feminism by questioning and subverting gender norms.

=== Latin America ===
In Latin American cultures, a [[Travesti (gender identity)|travesti]] is a person who has been assigned male at birth and who has a feminine, transfeminine, or "femme" gender identity. Travestis generally undergo hormonal treatment, use female gender expression including new names and pronouns from the masculine ones they were given when assigned a sex, and might use breast implants, but they are not offered or do not desire sex-reassignment surgery. Travesti might be regarded as a gender in itself (a "third gender"), a mix between man and woman ("intergender/androgynes"), or the presence of both masculine and feminine identities in a single person ("bigender"). They are framed as something entirely separate from transgender women, who possess the same gender identity of people assigned female at birth.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Other transgender identities are becoming more widely known, as a result of contact with other cultures of the Western world.<ref name="folha">[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/1231466-a-nova-geracao-gay-nas-universidades-dos-eua.shtml A nova geração gay nas Universidades dos EUA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222013956/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/1231466-a-nova-geracao-gay-nas-universidades-dos-eua.shtml|date=2014-02-22}} {{in lang|pt}}</ref> These newer identities, sometimes known under the umbrella use of the term "genderqueer",<ref name="folha" /> along with the older ''travesti'' term, are known as non-binary and go along with binary transgender identities (those traditionally diagnosed under the now obsolete label of "transsexualism") under the single umbrella of ''transgender'', but are distinguished from cross-dressers and drag queens and kings, that are held as nonconforming gender expressions rather than transgender gender identities when a distinction is made.<ref>[[João W. Nery]]: ''Viagem solitária: Memórias de um transexual 30 anos depois''; São Paulo: Leya, 2012, p. 293.{{in lang|pt}}</ref>

Deviating from the societal standards for sexual behavior, sexual orientation/identity, gender identity, and gender expression have a single umbrella term that is known as ''sexodiverso'' or ''sexodiversa'' in both Spanish and Portuguese, with its most approximate translation to English being "queer".{{citation needed|reason=I would translate sexodiverso more as 'gender nonconforming' in English.|date=January 2019}}

== Media representation ==
[[File:Laverne Cox by Sachyn Mital.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Actress [[Laverne Cox]], who is trans, in July 2014]]
As more transgender people are represented and included within the realm of mass culture, the stigma that is associated with being transgender can influence the decisions, ideas, and thoughts based upon it. Media representation, [[culture industry]], and [[Social exclusion|social marginalization]] all hint at popular culture standards and the applicability and significance to mass culture as well. These terms play an important role in the formation of notions for those who have little recognition or knowledge of transgender people. Media depictions represent only a minuscule spectrum of the transgender group,<ref>{{Cite web|title=MTV to launch new channel for gay viewers in 2005&nbsp;– May. 25, 2004|url=https://money.cnn.com/2004/05/25/news/fortune500/mtv_gay_network|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211113528/http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/25/news/fortune500/mtv_gay_network/|archive-date=2015-12-11|accessdate=2015-12-08|publisher=CNN}}</ref> which essentially conveys that those that are shown are the only interpretations and ideas society has of them.

[[File:Transgender Pride flag.svg|thumb|upright=0.95|Transgender Pride flag]]

A common symbol for the transgender community is the [[Transgender flags#Transgender Pride Flag (Monica Helms)|Transgender Pride Flag]], which was designed by the American transgender woman Monica Helms in 1999, and was first shown at a [[pride parade]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 2000. The flag consists of five horizontal stripes: light blue, pink, white, pink, and light blue. Helms describes the meaning of the flag as follows:

{{blockquote|The light blue is the traditional color for baby boys, pink is for girls, and the white in the middle is for "those who are transitioning, those who feel they have a neutral gender or no gender", and those who are [[Intersexuality|intersex]]. The pattern is such that "no matter which way you fly it, it will always be correct. This symbolizes us trying to find correctness in our own lives."<ref>{{cite news |last=Ford |first=Zack |date=August 27, 2014 |title=Transgender Pride Flag Designer Applauds Smithsonian LGBT Artifacts Collection |url=http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/08/27/3476435/transgender-pride-flag/ |newspaper=ThinkProgress |location=United States of America |access-date=December 4, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032253/http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/08/27/3476435/transgender-pride-flag/ |archive-date=November 17, 2015 }}</ref>}}
