===Elections===
In 1992, 25th district Congressman [[Edward Roybal]] announced his retirement after 30 years in Congress. Becerra entered the race for the seat, which had been renumbered as the 30th district after redistricting.

He won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 32% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=207769 CA - District 30 - Democratic Primary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020172525/http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=207769 |date=October 20, 2012 }} (1992) Our Campaigns</ref> In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Morry Waksberg 58%–24%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27863 CA District 30 – General Election] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924150938/http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27863 |date=September 24, 2015 }} (1992) Our Campaigns</ref>

His district was renumbered as the 31st district after the 2000 census.

After redistricting, ahead of the [[United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2012|2012 elections]], most of Becerra's old district became the 34th district. He defeated Republican Stephen Smith 85.6% to 14.4%.

===Tenure===
Becerra was a prominent member of the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]], of which he served as chairman during the [[105th United States Congress|105th Congress]].<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2007/07-167.html | title =Congressman Xavier Becerra To Deliver Hispanic Heritage Month Keynote | publisher =loc.gov | date =August 29, 2007 | access-date =December 30, 2017 | archive-date =March 5, 2016 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160305020202/http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2007/07-167.html | url-status =live }}</ref> He was featured on ''[[The Colbert Report|The Colbert Report's]]'' [[Better Know a District]] on August 17, 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/73148/august-17-2006/better-know-a-district---california-s-31st---javier-becerra-pt--2 | title =Better Know a District - California's 31st - Javier Becerra | publisher =colbertnation.com | date =August 17, 2006 | access-date =February 2, 2013 | archive-date =November 19, 2012 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20121119175443/http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/73148/august-17-2006/better-know-a-district---california-s-31st---javier-becerra-pt--2 | url-status =live }}</ref>

On September 29, 2008, Becerra voted against the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] because he "wanted to see direct protections for responsible homeowners" in the bill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/htbin/blog_inc?BLOG,ca31_becerra,blog,999,All,Item%20not%20found,ID=081001_2449,TEMPLATE=postingdetail.shtml |title=On the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act |access-date=December 6, 2008 |last=Becerra |first=Xavier |date=October 1, 2008 |work=The Becerra Blog |publisher=[[US House of Representatives]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211021139/http://www.house.gov/htbin/blog_inc?BLOG%2Cca31_becerra%2Cblog%2C999%2CAll%2CItem%20not%20found%2CID=081001_2449%2CTEMPLATE%3Dpostingdetail.shtml |archive-date=December 11, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Becerra considered running for Democratic Caucus Vice Chair for the [[110th Congress]]; however, he deferred to [[John Larson]] when [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee|DCCC]] chairman [[Rahm Emanuel]] decided to run for [[Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Caucus Chair]], the position Larson had been running for. Instead, Becerra was appointed assistant to the Speaker of the House for the 110th Congress.

Before the opening of the [[111th Congress]], Emanuel accepted a position as [[White House Chief of Staff]] in the [[Obama Administration]]. Larson succeeded Emanuel as caucus chair, and Becerra won his bid to succeed Larson as [[Democratic Caucus Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Vice-Chair]]. He defeated [[Marcy Kaptur]] of Ohio by a vote of 175–67.<ref name="Allen">{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/dems-back-off-leadership-challenges-2008-11-10.html|title=Dems back off leadership challenges|publisher=TheHill.com|last=Allen|first=Jared|access-date=November 10, 2008|archive-date=November 13, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113102600/http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/dems-back-off-leadership-challenges-2008-11-10.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2011, Becerra successfully ran for a second-term as [[Democratic Caucus Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Vice-Chair]] to serve during the [[112th Congress]].

During the [[111th Congress]] and [[112th Congress]], Becerra served on several high-profile committees. On March 24, 2010, Becerra was appointed to serve on the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]] (often called Bowles-Simpson/Simpson-Bowles). On August 11, 2011, Becerra was selected to serve on the [[Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction]] (also known as the Super Committee). And on December 23, 2011, Becerra was appointed to serve on a bicameral conference committee to find bipartisan solutions on the middle class tax cuts, unemployment insurance, and the Medicare physician payment rate.

====Taxes====
Becerra consistently expressed opposition to Social Security and Medicare cuts and tax provisions seen to benefit outsourcers.<ref>[http://votesmart.org/public-statement/738585/xavier-becerra-dnc-speech#.UKrzPaX3C8o Xavier Becerra DNC Speech] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910054937/https://www.votesmart.org/public-statement/738585/xavier-becerra-dnc-speech#.UKrzPaX3C8o |date=September 10, 2012 }} (Sept. 6, 2012) Vote Smart</ref> He argued against the Job Protection Act and Recession Prevention Act of 2012 which would extend certain tax provisions enacted in 2001 and 2003 under G.W.

Please note citations 22, 23 and 24 reference statements by Xavier Becerra and therefore any editorializing is suspect.

====Immigration====
Immigration is a pertinent issue for Becerra because of California's proximity to the border and its large number of undocumented immigrants. Becerra was a strong supporter of the DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform.<ref>[http://votesmart.org/public-statement/754608/dream-act Dream Act Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618010408/http://votesmart.org/public-statement/754608/dream-act |date=June 18, 2013 }} (Oct. 17, 2012) Vote Smart</ref> Becerra supported the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] program put in place by President Obama.<ref>[http://votesmart.org/public-statement/735091/rep-becerra-a-new-day-for-dreamers#.UKrzG6X3C8o Rep.

====Women's issues====
Becerra is strongly pro-choice and favors legal abortion up to the third trimester. On May 31, 2012, Becerra voted against H.R. 3541, the Prenatal Non-Discrimination Act (PRENDA), which would have imposed civil and criminal penalties on anyone knowingly attempting to perform a [[sex-selective abortion]]. The bill also would have required health care providers to report known or suspected violations to law enforcement, including suspicions about a woman's motives for seeking an abortion.<ref>[http://votesmart.org/public-statement/698938/capac-members-denounce-attack-on-reproductive-rights#.UKrwMaX3C8o CAPAC Members Denounce Attack on Reproductive Rights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011233609/http://votesmart.org/public-statement/698938/capac-members-denounce-attack-on-reproductive-rights#.UKrwMaX3C8o |date=October 11, 2012 }} (May 31, 2012) Vote Smart</ref> Becerra received a 100% rating from [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/elections-politics/congressional-scorecard.htm#/california/20 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130112105710/http%3A//www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/elections%2Dpolitics/congressional%2Dscorecard.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-12 |title=2013 CONGRESSIONAL SCORECARD |publisher=plannedparenthoodaction.org }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/2012-congressional-record.pdf | title=2012 Congressional Record on Choice | publisher=prochoiceamerica.org | access-date=February 2, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127044552/http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/2012-congressional-record.pdf | archive-date=January 27, 2013 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Becerra voted in favor of the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]] which made the 180-day statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination reset with each new paycheck affected by that discriminatory action.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll037.xml | title =FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 37 Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 | publisher =clerk.house.gov | date =January 27, 2009 | access-date =February 2, 2013 | archive-date =July 7, 2010 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100707034125/http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll037.xml | url-status =live }}</ref><ref>[http://votesmart.org/public-statement/685613/representative-becerra-on-equal-pay-day Representative Becerra on Equal Pay Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502215049/http://votesmart.org/public-statement/685613/representative-becerra-on-equal-pay-day |date=May 2, 2012 }} (April 18, 2012) Vote Smart</ref>

===Party leadership===
Becerra considered running for Democratic Caucus Vice Chair for the [[110th Congress]]; however, he deferred to [[John Larson]] when [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] chairman [[Rahm Emanuel]] decided to run for [[Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Caucus Chair]], the position Larson had been running for. Instead, Becerra was appointed assistant to the Speaker of the House for the 110th Congress.

Before the opening of the [[111th Congress]], Emanuel accepted a position as [[White House Chief of Staff]] in the [[Obama Administration]]. Larson succeeded Emanuel as caucus chair, and Becerra won his bid to succeed Larson as [[Democratic Caucus Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Vice-Chair]]. He defeated [[Marcy Kaptur]] of Ohio by a vote of 175–67.<ref name="Allen"/>

In 2011, Becerra won a second-term as [[Democratic Caucus Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Vice-Chair]] to serve during the [[112th Congress]]. During the 111th Congress and 112th Congress, Becerra served on several high-profile committees. On March 24, 2010, Becerra was appointed to serve on the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]] (often called Bowles-Simpson/Simpson-Bowles). On August 11, 2011, Becerra was selected to serve on the [[Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction]] (also known as the Super Committee). And on December 23, 2011, Becerra was appointed to serve on a bicameral conference committee to find bipartisan solutions on the middle class tax cuts, unemployment insurance, and the Medicare physician payment rate.
