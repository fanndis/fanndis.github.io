Delevingne walked in the Chanel Haute-Couture spring show and followed this up with an appearance in the [[Valentino (fashion house)|Valentino]] Haute Couture show before flying to New York to take part in New York Fashion Week, the first fashion week of the year. Her first appearance in New York was for Jason Wu. She subsequently walked for Rag & Bone, [[Tommy Hilfiger]], [[Diane von Furstenberg]], Marc by Marc Jacobs, [[Rodarte]], [[Derek Lam]], [[DKNY]], Carolina Herrera, [[Tory Burch]], [[Jeremy Scott]], Oscar de la Renta, [[Michael Kors (brand)|Michael Kors]], [[Anna Sui]] and finally Marc Jacobs' rearranged show, due to a delay in transportation of goods for the show due to the [[February 2013 nor'easter]].{{r|Smith-2014}}

During London Fashion Week she walked for Sister by Sibling, Issa, Topshop, [[Mulberry (company)|Mulberry]], Matthew Williamson, Peter Pilotto, Burberry and Giles. After this Delevingne walked in another seven shows at the Milan Fashion Week for Fendi, Ports 1961, DSquared<sup>2</sup>, [[Etro]], [[Versace]], [[Iceberg (fashion house)|Iceberg]] and [[Emilio Pucci|Pucci]].

In Paris, Delevingne walked in eleven shows for Katie Grand's collaboration with [[Tod's]] Hogan brand, [[H&M]], [[Lanvin (company)|Lanvin]], [[Vanessa Bruno]], [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], [[John Galliano]], Stella McCartney, [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], Chanel, Hakaan and Louis Vuitton. Delevingne's association with Katie Grand's collection went further than a catwalk show appearance as Delevingne sung 'I Want Candy' in the mini film called 'Gang', which is the title of the Katie Grand Loves Hogan 2013 collection and the name of the large-format magazine created to celebrate the collaboration.

In between the two international catwalk seasons, Delevingne was featured in Chanel's Cruise show which took place in Singapore. It was the first time Chanel had held this event in Asia and was held at the Loewen Cluster at Dempsey Hill, a British army barracks turned Singapore Armed Forces manpower base.<ref>{{cite web|title = Chanel Cruise Collection 2014|publisher = Elle UK|url = https://www.elle.com/uk/fashion/news/a3508/chanel-cruise-collection-2014-singapore-cara-delevingne-stella-tennant-lindsey-wixson-karl-lagerfeld/|access-date = 28 June 2019|language = en-UK|date = 10 May 2013|archive-date = 29 June 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190629002937/https://www.elle.com/uk/fashion/news/a3508/chanel-cruise-collection-2014-singapore-cara-delevingne-stella-tennant-lindsey-wixson-karl-lagerfeld/|url-status = live}}</ref>

The international fashion weeks began again in September 2013, to showcase spring/summer collections for 2014. In the first week, New York, she walked in only one show for Marc Jacobs in a show to which [[Style.com]] commented that, "...took us on a trip to the 1890s. The set looked like a bombed-out beach, with cigarette butts, Big Gulp cups, a tumbled-over Frozen Treats case, and destroyed fashion magazines strewn in the black sand."<ref>{{cite web|title = Spring 2014 Ready-to-Wear|url = http://www.style.com/fashion-shows/spring-2014-ready-to-wear/marc-jacobs|publisher = style.com|access-date = 21 June 2015|archive-date = 2 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150702214635/http://www.style.com/fashion-shows/spring-2014-ready-to-wear/marc-jacobs|url-status = live}}</ref>

In London, she walked in five shows. She opened for Mulberry and closed for Burberry and Topshop as well as walking Peter Pilotto and Giles. In Milan, Delevingne only walked for Fendi; she walked in just three shows in Paris for Stella McCartney, Chanel and Valentino. She rounded off the year by again appearing in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

==== 2015–present: Hiatus ====
It was noted by many that Delevingne had started to become more selective with the shows she appeared in. This was the beginning of the decrease in volume of catwalk roles, the cause of which at the time was put down to her expanding acting career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/story/cara-delevingne-time-essay|title=Cara Delevingne Wrote a Powerful Essay about Why She Stopped Modeling|magazine=[[Teen Vogue]]|last=McCall|first=Tyler|date=March 10, 2016|access-date=March 10, 2016|archive-date=11 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311073307/http://www.teenvogue.com/story/cara-delevingne-time-essay|url-status=live}}</ref> However, in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' essay published in 2016, Delevingne explained the real cause for the decrease of show appearances:

{{quote|It's taken time, but now I realize that work isn't everything and success comes in many forms. I've opened my mind, and now I embrace new things with a childlike curiosity. I'm spending more time doing the stuff I love. And I've been able to do better work because of it.{{r|Delevingne (2016)}}}}

In January 2014, Delevingne opened and closed the Chanel Haute Couture Spring 2014 show.<ref>{{cite web|title = Chanel Spring 2014 Couture Fashion Show Front Row|url = http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2014-couture/chanel/slideshow/front-row#13|work = [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|access-date = 8 November 2015|archive-date = 24 December 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151224052625/http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2014-couture/chanel/slideshow/front-row#13|url-status = live}}</ref> In the A/W 2014 collection showcases she went on to close Burberry's show in the London Fashion Week and appear in fellow British designer Giles' collection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pagesix.com/2014/02/18/cara-delevingne-takes-first-runway-selfie-video/|title=This is what it looks like to walk the runway|work=[[Page Six]]|last=Hood|first=Bryan|date=18 February 2014|access-date=1 July 2019|archive-date=1 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701022420/https://pagesix.com/2014/02/18/cara-delevingne-takes-first-runway-selfie-video/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In Milan, she opened Fendi's F/W 2014 collection for Karl Lagerfeld, before modelling for Stella McCartney in Paris. Her absence in New York was noticed due to Delevingne going from walking in 'just about every single show out there' to only walking in the Marc Jacobs show in 2013. News outlets wrote headlines such as, "Will Cara Delevingne Walk in New York Fashion Week?" in the run up to the fashion week.<ref>{{cite web|first=Rosie|last=Narasaki|title=Will Cara Delevingne Walk in New York Fashion Week?

In Paris, she walked in four shows for [[Givenchy]], Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel and Stella McCartney. She finished 2014 with the Metiers d'Art Pre-Fall 2015/2016 collection showcase.
