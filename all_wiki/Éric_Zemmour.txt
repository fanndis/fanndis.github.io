'''Éric Justin Léon Zemmour''' (born 31 August 1958) is a French essayist, political journalist and writer. His anti-liberal and anti-immigration positions are notorious in his homeland, as well as the numerous controversies he has been involved in. With the publication of ''[[The French Suicide]]'' (French: ''Le Suicide français'') in 2014, a book for which he was awarded the [[Prix Combourg-Chateaubriand]] the following year, he gained popularity outside of France. He also received the [[Prix Richelieu]] in 2011 for the whole of his career as a journalist.

Born in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]], he studied at [[Sciences Po]] and was hired by ''[[Le Quotidien de Paris]]'' in 1986. He later was a reporter for ''[[Le Figaro]]'' from 1996 until 2009 and has since had a column in ''[[Le Figaro Magazine]]''. Zemmour has appeared as a television personality on shows such as ''[[On n'est pas couché]]'' on [[France 2]]
(2006–2011), ''Ça se dispute'' on [[CNews|I-Télé]] (2003–2014) and ''Face à l'Info'' on [[CNews]] (since 2019). He has also appeared on ''Zemmour et Naulleau'' since 2011, a weekly evening [[talk show]] on [[Paris Première]], together with Éric Naulleau.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://tele.premiere.fr/News-Tele/Zemmour-et-Naulleau-les-snipers-du-PAF-a-l-antenne-le-23-septembre-2895564 Zemmour et Naulleau : les snipers du PAF à l'antenne le 23 septembre], tele.premiere.fr.</ref> He worked for [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]] from 2010 until 2019, first hosting the radio show ''Z comme Zemmour'' and later joining [[Yves Calvi]]'s morning news show as an analyst.

=== Political journalist ===

Zemmour, who graduated from the [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]], twice failed to gain admission to the [[École nationale d'administration]].<ref>{{Citation

|language=fr}}</ref> He began his career in 1986 at ''[[Le Quotidien de Paris]]'', under the leadership of Philippe Tesson, as a journalist at the politics desk. After the newspaper went out of business in 1994, he became an editorialist at ''Info-Matin'', where he stayed one year. He then joined the editorship of [[Le Figaro]] in 1996 as a [[political journalist]]. Zemmour was also a [[freelance journalist]] for ''Marianne'' in 1997 and for ''Valeurs actuelles'' in 1999.<ref>''Who's Who in France''</ref> In 2009, he moved from [[Le Figaro]] to Figaro Magazine, where he has since written a weekly column. He is also a political columnist at ''Le Spectacle du Monde''. Despite his failure to gain admission to the École nationale d'administration, his status as a political journalist allowed him to be a member of the admissions committee of the school in 2006.<ref name="Bordeaux Prépa">{{Citation

Zemmour has supported [[Rattachism]].<ref>Mélancolie française by Eric Zemmour</ref><ref name=lefigaro>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/monde/2014/08/04/31002-20140804ARTFIG00073-belgique-chronique-d-une-implosion-annoncee.php|title=Belgique : chronique d'une implosion annoncée|date=4 August 2014|website=Lefigaro.fr|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref>

=== Writer and essayist ===
Zemmour has written biographies of [[Édouard Balladur]] (''Balladur, immobile à grands pas'', or "Balladur, Rapidly Motionless") and [[Jacques Chirac]] (''L'Homme qui ne s'aimait pas'', or "The Man Who Did Not Like Himself") along with political essays. Notably, in 2006 he published ''Le Premier sexe'', a book on what he considers to be the [[feminization (sociology)|feminization]] of society. He worked on the screenplay for the film ''[[Dans la peau de Jacques Chirac]]'' by Michel Royer and Karl Zéro, although the latter stated that Zemmour's writing saw limited use.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.lejdd.fr/cmc/media/200815/l-infime-regret-de-karl-zero_108534.html L'infime regret de Karl Zéro], interview with Carlos Gomez, published on April 8, 2008, in ''Journal de Dimanche''</ref> In March 2010, with ''Mélancolie française'' (which won the Prix du livre incorrect), he revisits the [[history of France]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Talk with the author by Christophe Dickès, [http://www.canalacademie.com/ida5594-Eric-Zemmour-Melancolie-francaise.html Éric Zemmour : Mélancolie française ou l’idéal romain dans notre Histoire], on Canalacademie.com, uploaded March 18, 2010.</ref>

=== Television and radio personality ===
Since September 2003, he has participated every week on the show ''Ça se dispute'' on the 24-hour news channel [[I-Télé|i>Télé]] opposite Nicolas Domenach (Christophe Barbier until 2006). The channel has decided to stop the program in December 2014. He also appeared on ''Vendredi pétantes'' on [[Canal+]] until June 2006. Starting September 2006, he rejoined [[France 2]] to participate on the show ''On n'est pas couché'', hosted by Laurent Ruquier, accompanied by Michel Polac and then Éric Naulleau, where they were responsible for presenting honest criticism of films, books, albums, etc. During the show, their exchanges with cultural figures sometimes ended in clashes. On May 27, 2011, Laurent Ruquier announced in ''Le Parisien'' that he was replacing Éric Zemmour and Éric Naulleau with new contributors for the next season of ''On n'est pas couché''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/loisirs-et-spectacles/ruquier-pourquoi-je-me-separe-de-naulleau-et-zemmour-27-05-2011-1468965.php |title=Ruquier : " Pourquoi je me sépare de Naulleau et Zemmour " |website=Leparisien.fr|date=May 27, 2011|language=fr}}</ref> Éric Zemmour was also a participant on the show ''L'Hebdo'' as an editorialist on Tempo, a channel for the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]]; he was accompanied by, among others, {{ill|Dominique Wolton|fr}}. Finally, he was on the cable network ''Histoire'' on the show ''Le grand débat'', hosted by Michel Field.<ref name="Histoire">{{cite web | url=http://www.histoire.fr/histoire/emissions/histoire-grand-debat/ | title=Le grand débat | work=histoire.fr | year=2009 | language=fr}}</ref> Since January 4, 2010, he has presented a short piece on [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]] entitled ''Z comme Zemmour'' every Monday and Friday, during which he analyzes the news.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toutelatele.com./article.php3?id_article=21985|title= Eric Zemmour : " Je ne suis pas un provocateur "|date=January 4, 2012|author=Aurelie Demarcy|work=toutelatele|language=fr}}</ref> From September 2011, he has hosted ''Zemmour et Naulleau'' with Éric Naulleau, a weekly evening talk show on Paris Première.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tele.premiere.fr/News-Tele/Zemmour-et-Naulleau-les-snipers-du-PAF-a-l-antenne-le-23-septembre-2895564|title=Zemmour et Naulleau : les snipers du PAF à l'antenne le 23 septembre|website=Premiere.fr|date=August 30, 2011|language=fr}}</ref>

== Conflicts with his opponents ==

The subjects Zemmour addresses as well as the positions he defends have earned him a number of opponents. According to an article by François Dufay, ''La fronde des intellos'' (literal translation: The Revolt of the Intellectuals), in the June 2002 edition of ''Le Point'', [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] reportedly said that "[the] only three journalists who behave properly with respect to [him]" are Élisabeth Lévy, Éric Zemmour and [[Serge Moati]].<ref name="Frondedesintellos">{{Citation
 | last = Dufay
 | first = François
 | title = La fronde des intellos
 | newspaper = Le Point
 | date = June 7, 2002
|language=fr}}</ref> Zemmour noted during an interview: "I think he meant that with an ironic wink: it refers to his famous declaration fifteen years ago that caused such a scandal when he criticized [[Jean-Pierre Elkabbach|Elkabbach]], [[Ivan Levaï|Levaï]], who were all Jewish, and you'll note that the three who he noted treat him well are also all Jewish... And he knows that quite well, and everyone knows that quite well."<ref>{{cite book

On March 25, 2009, he filed a complaint against the French [[rapper]] [[Youssoupha]] for "criminal threats and public abuse" after the uploading of the song "Because of saying it" in which Zemmour was attacked ''[[ad hominem]]'': "Because of judging our faces, people know, that talking heads often demonize the ghetto-dwellers, each time it blows up they say it's us, I put a price on the head of the one who silences this asshole Éric Zemmour."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2009/04/21/eric-zemmour-porte-plainte-contre-le-rappeur-youssoupha-pour-menace_1183583_3224.html|title=Eric Zemmour porte plainte contre le rappeur Youssoupha pour menace|date=April 21, 2009|via=Le Monde}}</ref>

The rapper had clarified in a previous interview in the newspaper ''Le Parisien'' that he was not advocating silencing Zemmour by force, but rather by argument: "Silencing, it means putting him in his place. [...] The words don't refer to murder, or aggression, or injuries... I did not want to either have him killed or to deprive him of his freedom of expression. Silencing, it means to put him in his place, to expose him to his own contradictions."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/un-rappeur-s-en-prend-a-eric-zemmour-21-03-2009-449473.php|title=Un rappeur s'en prend à Eric Zemmour|first=Le 21 mars 2009|last=à 07h00|date=March 21, 2009|website=leparisien.fr}}</ref> The album was finally released on October 12, 2009, with an expurgated version of the controversial track in which Zemmour's name is scrambled out.

On October 26, 2011, Zemmour won his suit against the rapper and the Director General of [[EMI]] Music France, Valérie
Queinnec.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2011/10/26/97001-20111026FILWWW00448-eric-zemmour-fait-condamner-youssoupha.php|title=E.Zemmour fait condamner un rappeur|work=Le Figao.fr|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate=August 9, 2013|language=fr}}</ref>

On September 18, Zemmour created a new controversy by insulting the name of the columnist Hapsatou Sy in the program "Les terriens du dimanche". His words "it's your name that is an insult to France" were cut at the editing of the show but rebroadcast by the young woman. She decided to file a complaint against Zemmour.[https://www.lemonde.fr/televisions-radio/article/2018/09/18/votre-prenom-est-une-insulte-a-la-france-la-chroniqueuse-hapsatou-sy-diffuse-les-propos-d-eric-zemmour_5356756_1655027.html « Votre prénom est une insulte à la France » : la chroniqueuse Hapsatou Sy diffuse les propos d’Eric Zemmour]

== Overview of political positions ==
[[Raphaël Glucksmann]] described Zemmour as having "a very clear ambition, which is to erase the divide between the Republican right and the far right under the banner of the far right." In a radio show on [[France Inter]] in September 2017, Zemmour told Glucksmann, “You have understood me very well.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/magazine/eric-zemmour-france-far-right.html|title=The Right-Wing Pundit ‘Hashtag Triggering’ France|first=Elisabeth|last=Zerofsky|date=6 February 2019|accessdate=6 February 2019|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>{{dubious|VERY dubious! There is no obvious connection between the two quotes, but by juxtaposing the two, you create the wrong, misleading impression that Zemmour is directly commenting Glucksmann's statement. Typical Eisenstein montage technique, much used by all of the nastiest dictatorships. Shame on who did it here.|date=August 2020}}

=== Anti-neoliberalism ===
As a result of the views that he regularly expresses on television<ref>Notably ''Ça se dispute'' and ''On n'est pas couché''.</ref> and in his editorials in ''Le Figaro'', Zemmour is widely perceived, according to current mainstream categories, to be situated firmly on the [[right-wing politics|right]] of the political spectrum, but he also claims not to vote according to right-wing or [[left-wing politics]].<ref>{{YouTube|el8HFZje2cU|''On n'est pas couché''}} on September 8, 2007.</ref><ref name="questions Express">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/eric-zemmour-je-ne-demande-pas-la-francisation-des-noms_854520.html|title=Eric Zemmour: "Je ne demande pas la francisation des noms"|date=March 11, 2010|website=LExpress.fr}}</ref> He declares himself to be of the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] or [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] tradition<ref name="questions Express"/><ref name="Nostazemmour">Interview with Éric Zemmour by Nicky Depasse on ''Nostalgie Belgique'' on June 17, 2007.</ref><ref>[[Jean Sévillia]], [http://www.lefigaro.fr/lefigaromagazine/2010/02/27/01006-20100227ARTMAG00085--zemmour-feu-sur-les-idees-recues-.php « Zemmour. Feu sur les idées reçues »], ''Le Figaro'', February 26, 2010</ref> while acknowledging the relevance of [[Marxist]] analyses, particularly concerning the sources of profit in [[capitalism]], including [[immigration]]. According to him, capitalism destroys traditional structures like the family in order to impose the rule of the market, an upheaval that has been particularly notable since the events of [[May 1968]].

He takes a conservative stance on social issues and is also resolutely anti-[[economic liberalism|liberal]] on economic issues. He thus identifies himself as a [[reactionary]] in opposition to a society that deconstructs [[social order]], in particular the family and traditions, in the service of a false goal, liberating the individual who in reality finds himself isolated and reduced to the sole status of a consumer. He presents reaction as subversive in the light of the fact that progressives, today dominant in the fields of culture and media, cannot claim to criticize the established order since they themselves constitute this order and fix its norms.<ref>{{Citation

Economically anti-[[economic liberalism|liberal]], his disapproval of [[free trade]] drives him to oppose [[European federalism]]<ref>Recurring themes on ''Ça se dispute'' and in his editorials in ''Le Figaro'', and set forth in particular during his interview with [[François Bayrou]] in ''On n'est pas couché'' on December 1, 2007.</ref> and the [[European Union]], which he considers to be clearly in favour of the free movement of goods and in deep conflict with the French social model. According to him, because of the European Union, the left, like the right, must apply "the same economic policy, social liberalism or liberal socialism"<ref>''Ça se dispute'', [[i-Télé|i>Télé]], September 2007</ref> because, in the words of [[Philippe Séguin]], "right and left are retailers of the same wholesaler, Europe."<ref>Interview with François Bayrou on the TV show ''On n'est pas couché'' on December 1, 2007.</ref>

=== Humanitarian intervention and the doctrine of human rights ===

Éric Zemmour often expresses opinions that he describes as "anti-human-rights-doctrine", thus bringing himself in opposition to some politicians ([[Bernard Kouchner]]), writers ([[Bernard-Henri Lévy]]), and organizations advocating the right to [[humanitarian intervention]], which he considers to be a form of [[neocolonialism]].<ref>{{Citation

=== Immigration, the notion of race and anti-racism ===

==== Immigration and assimilation ====

A member of the [[France|French]] [[cultural assimilation|assimilationist]] tradition, Zemmour strongly opposes immigration and the current model of integrating immigrants which he considers to be too lenient<ref>Fabrice Madouas,
[http://www.valeursactuelles.com/dossier-dactualité/dossier-dactualité/zemmour-droite-perdu-ses-repères.html « Éric Zemmour : "La droite a perdu ses repères" »], ''Valeurs actuelles'', March 25, 2010.</ref> in comparison to its predecessors. In November 2008, he gave an interview to the monthly ''Le Choc du mois'' where he compared immigration to a "[[demographic]] [[tsunami]]"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lechocdumois.fr/choc27.htm|title=This domain was registered by Youdot.io|website=www.lechocdumois.fr}}</ref> He has also come out in favor of the [[Thierry Mariani]] amendment, which would require genetic tests in order to qualify for [[family reunification]].<ref>''Ripostes'', [[France 5]], September 23, 2007.</ref> On numerous occasions, he has declared that he is for [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], even if he himself considers it "neurotic". In particular, he expresses a nostalgia for the era of his youth, the 1960s, when there was a cultural unity.

All his recurring views on the theme of immigration, as well as his virulent attacks against certain organizations (DAL and [[SOS Racisme]] in particular) are regularly the subject of controversy.

==== Comments on race ====

Éric Zemmour declared on [[Arte]] on 13 November 2008, while he was on the show ''Paris/Berlin: the debate ''<ref>[http://www.vincentcespedes.net/fr/Paris-Berlin.pdf ''Paris/Berlin : le débat''], transcript of the November 13, 2008, show.</ref> hosted by Isabelle Giordano that blacks and whites belonged to two different [[race (classification of humans)|races]] and that this difference was discernible by skin color, without ranking them hierarchically. He asserted that [[Melanesians]] and [[Antillean]]s belonged to the same race. "If there is no such thing as race, there is no such thing as intermixing." He continued, "The sacralization of race during the Nazi period and earlier has been followed by the negation of race. And to me, they're both equally ridiculous."

The philosopher Vincent Cespedes, who was on the show, exercised his [[right of reply]] by writing up a response on the website of Arte<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/fr/accueil/recherche/2321286.html|title=Response of Vincent Cespedes}}</ref> and responded to the "Zemmourists" on his blog.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.vincentcespedes.net/blog/index.php?2008/11/29/25-double-polemique#c4039 Vincent Cespedes répond aux zemmouristes, December 7, 2008].</ref> Following a number of controversies on the Internet as a result of his comments, Zemmour also published a reply in the weekly ''Vendredi''.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205173150/http://www.marianne2.fr/Polemique-sur-les-races-Zemmour-repond-aux-internautes_a93762.html |date=5 February 2009 |title=Polémique sur les races : Zemmour répond aux internautes }}.</ref>

Faced with the general outcry caused by the views expressed by Éric Zemmour during the show, the deputy manager of programs for the Arte channel explained on ''Télérama'': "I did not think he would express himself in such a clumsy way! Our channel, of course, is not associated with Zemmour's views.... we'll think twice before inviting him again!"<ref>Thierry
Leclère, « Affaire Zemmour : Arte sort enfin du silence », in ''[[Télérama]]'' no. 3076, 18 December 2008 [http://www.telerama.fr/idees/affaire-zemmour-arte-sort-de-son-silence,36428.php].</ref>

==== Anti-racism ====

Zemmour says he would like to put on trial the anti-racism of the 1980s,<ref>Interview with Éric Zemmour by Monique Atlan on the show ''"Quelle étagère..."'', January 14, 2008</ref> which he considers, along with feminism, to be a "bien-pensant cause" derived from the "milieu of French and Western pseudo-elites" that the people will not follow in the least.<ref name="Migros" /> He says that it was especially after having "read [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]" who is known for his positions and work on the [[Nouvelle droite]] and [[anti-racism]] that he "understood that anti-racist progressivism was the successor of communism, with the same totalitarian methods developed by the [[Comintern]] during the 1930s."<ref>Éric Zemmour, [http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&objet_id=1008327 Immigration : le réel interdit], ''[[Le Monde]]'',
October 12, 2007.</ref> According to him, anti-racism is a tactic initiated by [[François Mitterrand]] to make people forget the Left's turn to [[economic liberalism]] in 1983. He claims that anti-racism is an ideology implemented by former leftists who had had to give up their illusions. With immigrants, these people had found a kind of alternative revolutionary people.<ref name="Migros"/>

He believes the "gay ideology" to be one of the main means used to invite "man to become a woman like the others," to adopt the behavior of women.<ref name="Nostazemmour" /> In his book ''Petit Frère'', a character ponders the place to be given to homosexual individuals: "In every traditional society, founded on shame and secrecy, respect for life, and the fear of death, "gays" would have been stigmatized and isolated, like the lepers of old." The author does not fail, afterwards, to explain that these are the views of characters in a novel.

=== Conviction for provocation to racial discrimination ===
The [[International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism]] (LICRA) decided to launch legal proceedings against Éric Zemmour for his views after the 6 March 2010 broadcast of ''Salut les Terriens'' presented by Thierry Ardisson, where he promoted his book ''Mélancolie française''. He declared during the show that: "French people with an immigrant background were profiled because most traffickers are Blacks and Arabs... it is a fact."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.news.yahoo.com/64/20100316/tfr-la-licra-va-poursuivre-en-justice-er-a2f96e4.html|title=La LICRA va poursuivre en justice Éric Zemmour, March 16, 2010, on lemonde.fr|website=Fr.news.yahoo.com|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref> The same day, he asserted on [[France Ô]] that employers "had the right to refuse Arabs or Blacks".<ref name=AFP18>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hhZGUnXiwm0rMZdf7VjFeA8zJFPA?docId=CNG.a1a93435f42f9aac39c88050ce1da502.3a1|title=Eric Zemmour condamné pour provocation à la discrimination raciale|website=Google.com|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref> The Club Averroes<ref>AFP, «

On 23 March 2010, he wrote a letter to LICRA<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marianne2.fr/comparatif-banques-en-ligne|title=Meilleure banque en ligne : comparatif des établissements 2019|website=Marianne2.fr|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref> explaining his views. In this letter he noted particularly the views of Christian Delorme before a parliamentary commission of the [[French Senate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agoravox.fr/tribune-libre/article/et-si-l-affaire-zemmour-faisait-72191|title=Et si l'affaire Zemmour faisait réfléchir ?|date=March 24, 2010|website=AgoraVox}}</ref> He also cited the book ''L'Islam dans les prisons'' by Farhad Khosrokhavar, who confirmed the figure of 70 or 80% of "Muslims in prison" estimated in a survey commissioned by the [[Ministry of Justice (France)|Ministry of Justice]]. The editors of ''L'Express'' noted that Farhad Khosrokhavar estimated the share of Muslim prisoners in certain prisons near so-called sensitive districts as between 50% and 80% and that there were no official national statistics on the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/eric-zemmour-je-ne-demande-pas-la-francisation-des-noms_854520.html|title=Eric Zemmour: "Je ne demande pas la francisation des noms"|date=11 March 2010|website=LExpress.fr|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref>

MRAP deplored the fact that ethnic origins (and not social situation) were being compared with the rate of criminality, and that all persons who shared the same ethnic origins were being exposed to suspicions of being potential criminals, and that it was their common origin which was being presented as "criminogenic." MRAP thus decided to take the issue before the courts because according to it "by linking the misdeeds of these persons to their ethnic origins—and not to the process of social marginalization, the concentration of poverty in certain areas, to what some in fact call a 'ghettoization'—the journalist injured a group of persons defined by their ethnic origins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrap.fr/communiques/document.2010-03-25.6379107021/view?searchterm=zemmour|title=MRAP|website=Mrap.fr|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref>

Benoist Hurel, Assistant General Secretary of the [[Syndicat de la magistrature]], accused the views of Éric Zemmour of being "stigmatizing" and "proto-racist", denouncing the link between skin color and criminality as "not corresponding to reality."<ref>[http://lci.tf1.fr/france/justice/2010-03/affaire-zemmour-bilger-des-propos-aberrants-5786608.html Affaire Zemmour-Bilger : "des propos aberrants"] on the website of [[TF1]].</ref> On the other hand, the senior judge Philippe Bilger supported the views of the journalist and asserted concerning traffickers that "many of them are blacks and Arabs"<ref>Philippe Bilger, [http://www.philippebilger.com/blog/2010/03/eric-zemmour-ou-le-trublion-officiel.html « Éric Zemmour ou le trublion officiel », March 17, 2010]</ref><ref>« [http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/audio-un-haut-magistrat-defend-les-propos-controverses-de-zemmour-24-03-2010-861481.php Un haut-magistrat défend les propos controversés de Zemmour] », ''leParisien.fr'', 24 mars 2010.</ref> (which resulted in the summoning of Philippe Bilger by a prosecutor in Paris, François Falletti).

On 30 March 2010, Éric Zemmour was ordered by [[SOS Racisme]] to appear in court on 29 June 2010, where he "will have to answer for the crimes of racial defamation and incitement to racial hatred."<ref>''[http://www.leparisien.fr/actualite-people-medias/eric-zemmour-assigne-le-29-juin-par-sos-racisme-30-03-2010-868569.php Éric Zemmour assigné le 29 juin par SOS Racisme]'', leparisien.fr</ref> Despite his summons before the Seventeenth Criminal Court of the [[Judiciary of France#"Grande instance" Courts|Superior Court]] on this day, the trial was postponed to the 11th, 13th, and 14 January 2011 due to the proliferation of civil action filings, among which were a number of anti-racist organizations.<ref>[http://www.martinique.franceantilles.fr/actualite/faitsdivers/le-proces-zemmour-renvoye-au-mois-de-janvier-29-06-2010-77675.php « Le procès Zemmour renvoyé au mois de janvier »] on the website FranceAntilles.fr</ref> Moreover, these views and the trial were given international scope by an article devoted to them and to Zemmour in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in February 2011.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/world/europe/12zemmour.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 ''French Provocateur Enters Battle Over Comments''] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on February 11, 2011.</ref> During the trial, Zemmour received testimony in his favor from the journalist [[Robert Ménard]], his fellow columnist Éric Naulleau, the writer [[Denis Tillinac]], the politician [[Claude Goasguen]] and the essayist Xavier Raufer.

On 18 February 2011, the Seventeenth Criminal Court of Paris sentenced Éric Zemmour to a suspended fine of €2,000 for the views expressed on France Ô, the fine being divided between two judgments equally: the first judgment concerning the proceedings brought by SOS Racisme, LICRA, and the MRAP and a second judgment concerning those brought by UEJF and J'accuse. The court concluded that the polemicist had justified an unlawful discriminatory practice—discrimination in hiring—in presenting it as legitimate. On the other hand, he was released from the proceedings for racial defamation for the views presented on the show ''Salut les Terriens'', which were judged "shocking" but not "defamatory."

Moreover, in addition to the fine, the first judgment sentenced him to pay €1,000 in damages and interest and €2,000 in legal costs to each of the three organizations (totalling €9,000) and the second sentenced him to pay one euro to each of the civil parties and €750 in legal costs (totalling €1,502).<ref name=AFP18 /><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.20minutes.fr/article/672603/societe-eric-zemmour-reconnu-coupable-provocation-discrimination-raciale|title=Eric Zemmour condamné pour provocation à la discrimination raciale|work=20 minutes.fr|date=February 18, 2011|language=fr}}</ref>
