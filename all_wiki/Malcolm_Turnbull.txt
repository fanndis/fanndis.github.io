{{Malcolm Turnbull sidebar}}
'''Malcolm Bligh Turnbull''' (born 24 October 1954) is a retired Australian politician who was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|29th]] [[Prime Minister of Australia]] from 2015 to 2018. He served twice as [[Liberal Party of Australia|Leader of the Liberal Party]], from [[2008 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|2008]] to [[2009 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|2009]] when he was [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]], and from [[September_2015_Liberal_Party_of_Australia_leadership_spill|2015]] to [[2018_Liberal_Party_of_Australia_leadership_spills#Second_spill_(24_August)|2018]] when he was Prime Minister. He was the MP for [[Division of Wentworth|Wentworth]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from 2004 to 2018.

Turnbull graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] with a Bachelor of Arts and a [[Bachelor of Laws]], before attending [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]], earning a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]]. For over two decades prior to entering politics, he worked as a journalist, lawyer, [[merchant bank]]er, and [[venture capital]]ist. He served as Chair of the [[Australian Republic Movement|Australian Republican Movement]] from 1993 to 2000, and was one of the leaders of the unsuccessful "Yes" campaign in the [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 republic referendum]]. He was first elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] for the [[Division of Wentworth]] in [[New South Wales]] at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]], and was [[Minister of the Environment (Australia)|Minister for the Environment and Water]] from January 2007 until December 2007.

After coming second in the [[2007 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|2007 leadership election]], Turnbull [[2008 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|won the leadership]] of the Liberal Party in September 2008 and became [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]]. However, his support of the [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]] proposed by the [[Rudd Government (2007–2010)|Rudd Government]] in December 2009 led to a [[2009 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|leadership challenge]] by [[Tony Abbott]], who defeated Turnbull by a single vote. Though initially planning to leave politics after this, Turnbull chose to stay and was later appointed [[Minister for Communications (Australia)|Minister for Communications]] in the [[Abbott Government]] following the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]].

Citing consistently poor opinion polling for the government, Turnbull resigned from the Cabinet on 14 September 2015 and [[September 2015 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|challenged]] Abbott, reclaiming the leadership of the Liberal Party by ten votes. He was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Australia]] the following day. The [[Turnbull Government]] initiated the National Innovation and Science Agenda as a key economic priority, working to promote [[STEM]] education and increase [[venture capital]] funding for new [[start-ups]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Borrello |first1=Eliza |title=Innovation statement: PM Malcolm Turnbull calls for 'ideas boom' as he unveils $1b vision for Australia's future |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-07/pm-malcolm-turnbull-unveils-$1-billion-innovation-program/7006952 |website=ABC News |access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref> Turnbull also pursued "city deals" with local and state governments to improve planning outcomes and encourage investment in projects such as the [[Western Sydney Airport]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dole |first1=Nick |title=UK 'city deals' model to be adapted for Australia under Malcolm Turnbull's cities plan |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-25/uk-city-model-to-be-adapted-for-australia/7276252 |website=ABC News |access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref>

At the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]], Turnbull led the Coalition to victory by a single seat, the smallest majority since the [[1961 Australian federal election|1961 federal election]].<ref name=lead2>{{cite web |url=http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HousePartyRepresentationLeading-20499.htm |title=Party representation – 2016 Tally Room: AEC |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720071728/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HousePartyRepresentationLeading-20499.htm |archive-date=20 July 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In his second term, Turnbull sought and campaigned for a [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey|plebiscite to legalise same-sex marriage in Australia]], which was ultimately successful. In late 2017, his government experienced a [[2017-18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|parliamentary eligibility crisis]] that saw fifteen parliamentarians leave parliament due to concerns about [[dual citizenship]]. To address climate change and reform energy policy, Turnbull proposed the [[National Energy Guarantee]] which was ultimately rejected by the party room and led to calls for a [[leadership spill]].

In August 2018, a challenge by [[Peter Dutton]] led to [[2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills|two Liberal leadership spills]]. When the second spill motion passed on 24 August 2018, Turnbull did not contest the ballot and subsequently resigned as Prime Minister. Treasurer [[Scott Morrison]] defeated Dutton and deputy leader [[Julie Bishop]] in the contest. Turnbull resigned from parliament on 31 August 2018, triggering a [[2018 Wentworth by-election|by-election in his former seat of Wentworth]].<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.afr.com/news/politics/election/malcolm-turnbull-formally-resigns-forces-byelection-20180831-h14rte?|title=Malcolm Turnbull formally resigns, forces byelection|last=Mizen|first=Ronald|date=31 August 2018|newspaper=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|language=en|access-date=31 August 2018}}</ref> The Liberal Party lost the by-election to independent candidate [[Kerryn Phelps]], which resulted in the Coalition losing its majority in the House of Representatives.

Since leaving Parliament, Turnbull has become an advisor to Kasada, an Australian [[cybersecurity]] start-up.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eyers |first1=James |title=Turnbull joins Kasada board, touts Huawei foresight |url=https://www.afr.com/technology/turnbull-joins-kasada-board-touts-huawei-foresight-20200621-p554s1 |website=Australian Financial Review |access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref>

== Professional career ==
After graduating from Oxford, Turnbull returned to Australia and began working as a [[barrister]]. He was general counsel and secretary for [[ACP Magazines|Australian Consolidated Press]] Holdings Group from 1983 to 1985. During this time, he defended [[Kerry Packer]] against the "Goanna" allegations made by the [[Costigan Commission#Broader investigations|Costigan Commission]]. Turnbull attempted to use the press to goad the counsel assisting the commission, Douglas Meagher QC, into suing him and Packer for the withering public attack both undertook to sully Meagher's and Costigan's names. Turnbull accused Meagher and Costigan of being "unjust, capricious, dishonest and malicious". Turnbull later advised Packer to sue Meagher for defamation, an action that was struck down by Justice [[David Hunt (judge)|David Hunt]] as being an [[abuse of process]], saying that Turnbull had managed "to poison the fountain of justice". These tactics made Turnbull enemies within the NSW Bar Association, leading to Turnbull's departure from that organisation.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/gw-classics/raging-turnbull-20140904-10c7ye.html| title=Raging Turnbull| author=John Lyons| newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]| date=16 September 2014| access-date=15 April 2017}}</ref>

In partnership with Bruce McWilliam, he established his own law firm, Turnbull McWilliam. During 1986, Turnbull defended [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]], a former [[MI5]] official who wrote the book ''[[Spycatcher]]'', successfully stopping the British government's attempts to suppress the book's publication in Australia. The case was widely reported, making Turnbull a public figure in Australia and the [[United Kingdom]]; Turnbull later wrote a book on the trial.<ref name="ABC_4Corners">{{cite news |first=Sarah|last=Ferguson|author-link=Sarah Ferguson (journalist)|title=My Brilliant Career|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2008/s2346015.htm|work=[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]] |publisher=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]]|date=25 August 2008|access-date=10 September 2008|format=transcript }}</ref>

Turnbull, "The Spycatcher Trial" (1988), 195.</ref>}}

In 1987, Turnbull established an investment banking firm, Whitlam Turnbull & Co Ltd, in partnership with [[Neville Wran]], the former [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Premier of New South Wales]], and [[Nicholas Whitlam]], the former Chief Executive of the [[State Bank of New South Wales]] and the son of former Labor [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]]. Whitlam parted company with the firm in 1990; it operated as Turnbull & Partners Ltd until 1997.

Turnbull left the firm he co-founded in 1997 to become a managing director of [[Goldman Sachs]] Australia, eventually becoming a partner in Goldman Sachs and Co. Additionally, he worked as a director of Star Technology Systems from 1993 to 1995. During this time Turnbull was also the chairman of Axiom Forest Resources, which conducted logging in the [[Solomon Islands]] under the trading name Silvania Forest Products. The latter's work was described by the [[Australian International Development Assistance Bureau]] as a "[[clearcutting|clear-felling]] operation", and the then Solomon Islands Prime Minister [[Solomon Mamaloni]] reportedly threatened to close it down for "constant breaches of logging practices", according to a critical article in the ''Solomon Times''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=2632|title=A Former Logger Becomes Australian Federal Opposition Leader|work=Solomon Times|date=21 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/programguide/stories/200809/s2375448.htm|title=Turnbull's logging background raises questions|last=Randhawa|first=Sonia|date=26 September 2008|work=[[ABC Radio Australia]]|access-date=27 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216122450/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/programguide/stories/200809/s2375448.htm|archive-date=16 December 2008}}</ref>

Turnbull purchased a stake in the [[internet service provider]] [[OzEmail]] in 1994 for $500,000. He sold this stake several months before the [[Dot-com bubble|dot com bubble burst]] in 1999 for $57&nbsp;million to then-telecommunications giant MCI [[Worldcom]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Colley|first1=Andrew|title=OzEmail trio presses delete on 18-year association|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/ozemail-trio-presses-delete-on-18-year-association/story-fn91v9q3-1226311799373|access-date=31 May 2016|work=After listing on the NASDAQ in 1996 with Turnbull's help, OzEmail purchased a 50 per cent stake in web hosting company, WebCentral.

In May 2002, Turnbull appeared before the [[HIH Insurance]] [[royal commission]] to be questioned on Goldman Sachs's involvement in the possible [[privatisation]] of one of the acquisitions of the collapsed insurance company.

In 1981, Turnbull stood for Liberal Party [[preselection]] in the [[Division of Wentworth]] prior to the [[1981 Wentworth by-election]]. He was defeated by [[Peter Coleman]], who went on to win the seat.<ref name=ra>{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Ackland|author-link=Richard Ackland|title=A sureness that weakens Turnbull's case|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=17 October 2003|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/16/1065917548326.html?from=storyrhs|access-date=10 September 2007 }}</ref> In 1982, following his retirement from politics, former prime minister [[William McMahon]] nominated Turnbull as his preferred successor in [[Division of Lowe|Lowe]]; the Liberals chose another candidate, and lost [[1982 Lowe by-election|the by-election]] to Labor.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/126869850|title=McMahon's 'suggestion for Lowe candidate'|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=6 January 1982}}</ref> Turnbull later attempted preselection in the safe state seat of [[Electoral district of Mosman|Mosman]] in 1983, losing to [[Phillip Smiles]].

He also spent time as a director of the [[Menzies Research Centre]], the Liberal Party's research centre.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Australian Republican Movement ===
In 1993, Turnbull was appointed by Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] as Chair of the [[Republic Advisory Committee]], charged with exploring ways of moving Australia to a [[Republicanism in Australia|republican form of government]] by replacing the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]] with an elected Australian head of state. Later that year, Turnbull became Chair of the [[Australian Republic Movement|Australian Republican Movement]], a position he would hold until 2000. He was an elected delegate at the [[1998 Australian Constitutional Convention]] in [[Canberra]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Vizard, Steve|author-link=Steve Vizard|title=Two Weeks in Lilliput: Bear Baiting and Backbiting At the Constitutional Convention|publisher=Penguin|year=1998|isbn=0-14-027983-0}}</ref> At the Convention, Turnbull cautioned against mixing the roles of President and Prime Minister, advocating a [[parliamentary republic]], and supported the [[bi-partisan appointment republican model]] adopted by the convention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/republic98/hansard/hans4.html |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/nph-arch/1999/Z1999-Dec-10/http://www.theage.com.au/republic98/hansard/hans4.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 December 1999 |title=The Age and Sydney Morning Herald – Australia's Constitutional Convention 1998|work=Pandora|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|access-date=31 July 2012}}</ref>

Turnbull was an active campaigner in the unsuccessful [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]] to establish an [[Republicanism in Australia|Australian republic]], serving as Chair of the Yes Committee. He published a book on the campaign, titled ''Fighting for the Republic''. When the referendum failed, he accused incumbent Prime Minister and monarchist [[John Howard]] of "breaking the nation's heart".<ref name=tguard>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/15/malcolm-turnbull-australia-new-pm-prime-minister-profile-liberal-party |title=Australia's new PM: Liberal party stands back to watch the 'Malcolm experiment' – The Guardian 15 September 2015 |newspaper=[[The Guardian Australia]] |date=27 November 2014 |access-date=14 December 2015}}</ref> Turnbull retired from the Australian Republican Movement in 2000, having already left the board of [[Ausflag]] in 1994; he joined the [[Australian National Flag Association]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ausflag.com.au/debate/nma/aus040820.html |title=Malcolm Turnbull joins the Australian National Flag Association |publisher=[[Ausflag]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407190933/http://www.ausflag.com.au/debate/nma/aus040820.html |archive-date=7 April 2007}}</ref>

===Choice of political party===
Turnbull has had a long affiliation with the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] throughout his career. During his time in the Australian Republican Movement however, he considered running for preselection for the [[Australian Labor Party]]. In 2015, it was revealed that Turnbull had held talks with Labor state politician [[John Della Bosca]] during the 1990s on a possible party switch, and that he had harboured aspirations in his youth to head the [[Australian Workers' Union]], which is linked with the Labor Party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/how-young-malcolm-turnbull-dreamt-of-being-a-union-leader-and-nearly-ran-for-labor/news-story/a0f0ae8703e02129b98e9ade8a61054f |title=How young Malcolm Turnbull dreamt of being a union leader and nearly ran for Labor |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> The accusation, made by former Labor Foreign Minister [[Bob Carr]], was cited by Labor Leader [[Bill Shorten]] during the [[Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2015/11/12/shorten-turnbull-awu_n_8540670.html|title=Bill Shorten Claims Malcolm Turnbull Wanted To Be Secretary of the AWU|date=12 November 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref>

==Howard Government==
===Entry to parliament===

In 2000, Turnbull intended to seek Liberal preselection for [[Division of Wentworth|Wentworth]] but did not eventually contest after concluding that preselection hopeful [[Peter King (Australian politician)|Peter King]] had the numbers in the branches.<ref name=smhrise/> In 2003, Turnbull announced that he would challenge King for the seat and successfully defeated him to become the Liberal candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s967026.htm|title=Lateline – 14/10/2003: Turnbull sets sights on Wentworth. Australian Broadcasting Corp|access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=smhrise/> During what was a bitter preselection campaign, King accused Turnbull of [[branch stacking]], by having local members transferring their membership to a branch that would decide the pre-selection, what King referred to as "branch stripping".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2003/s966267.htm| title=King criticises Turnbull's branch stacking tactics| author=Linda Mottram| publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Commission|ABC]]| date=14 October 2003| access-date=15 April 2017}}</ref>

Following his preselection loss, King stood against Turnbull at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]] as an [[independent politician|independent]] candidate. As a result, the traditionally safe Liberal seat became an electoral wildcard, the contest becoming a three-person race between Turnbull, King and the Labor candidate David Patch. During the campaign, Turnbull spent over {{AUD}}600,000 on his campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Candidate electoral return for the election held on 9 October 2004|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|year=2004|url=http://fader.aec.gov.au/return/12246/FAD03/729.pdf|access-date=28 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803190736/http://fader.aec.gov.au/return/12246/FAD03/729.pdf|archive-date=3 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> While the Liberal primary vote eventually fell by 10.3% to a total 41.8%, King received only 18% of the primary vote with a 57%/43% Liberal/Labor preference split which meant Turnbull was elected, albeit on a reduced 55.5% [[Two-party-preferred vote|two-party vote]] after a 2.4% [[Swing (Australian politics)|swing]]. The result meant that Wentworth was classified as a marginal seat for the first time since the [[1993 Australian federal election|1993 federal election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/12246/results/HouseDivisionDop-12246-152.htm|title=Division Distribution of Preferences|first=Australian Electoral|last=Commission|access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref>

=== Cabinet Minister ===
{{Main|Fourth Howard Ministry}}
Announcing a cabinet reshuffle on 24 January 2006, Prime Minister John Howard promoted Turnbull from the backbench to the role of [[parliamentary secretary]], giving him special responsibility for water at the height of the [[2000s Australian drought]].<ref name="ABC-career">{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-09/malcolm-turnbull-political-career-leadership-spill/6078656 | title=Malcolm Turnbull: From international case-winning barrister to struggling opposition leader, 'Mr Broadband' | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | date=14 September 2015 | access-date=14 September 2015 | author=Jenentt, Greg}}</ref> On 26 September 2006, Howard announced the creation of a new Office of Water Resources, sitting within the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]], to address the problem of drought in Australia; Turnbull was given responsibility for this office.

In January 2007, Howard promoted Turnbull to the [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]] as [[Minister of the Environment (Australia)|Minister for the Environment and Water]]. In this position, Turnbull approved a proposed {{AUD}}1.7&nbsp;billion [[Bell Bay Pulp Mill]] in north [[Tasmania]], near [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]].<ref name="AGE_approves">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/green-light-for-pulp-mill/2007/10/04/1191091238327.html|title=Turnbull approves Tasmanian pulp mill|work=[[The Age]]|date=4 October 2007|access-date=19 November 2007|location=Melbourne|first=Dan|last=Harrison}}</ref> Turnbull's approval of the Bell Bay Pulp Mill project of [[Gunns]] came on 4 October 2007 and followed a report by the Government's chief scientist [[Jim Peacock]] on the project's potential environmental impact, which required the project to meet 48 "strict environmental" conditions.

In February 2007, Turnbull was criticised for claiming a government allowance of {{AUD}}175 a night and paying it to his wife as rent while living in a townhouse owned by her in Canberra.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turnbull defends using travel allowance to pay rent at wife's house |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=25 February 2007 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200702/s1856270.htm |access-date=28 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207003742/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200702/s1856270.htm |archive-date=7 December 2007 }}</ref>

During the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]] campaign, Turnbull announced that if re-elected the Government would contribute {{AUD}}10&nbsp;million to the investigation of an untried Russian technology that aims to trigger rainfall from the atmosphere, even when there are no clouds. The Australian Rain Corporation presented research documents written in Russian, explained by a Russian researcher who spoke to local experts in Russian.<ref name="rainmaking gamble">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/20/2095678.htm|title=Turnbull pumps $10m into rainmaking gamble|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|location=Australia|date=20 November 2007|access-date=21 November 2007}}</ref> Although Turnbull claimed that the Australian Rain Corporation was Australian-based, investigations revealed that it was 75% Swiss-owned. It was also revealed that a prominent stakeholder in the Australian Rain Corporation, Matt Handbury, is a nephew of [[Rupert Murdoch]]. Turnbull refused to answer questions regarding Handbury's contribution to the Wentworth Forum, the main fund-raising organisation for Turnbull's 2007 election campaign.<ref name="rainmaking gamble" />

== Opposition ==
===Aftermath of 2007 election===
Turnbull retained his seat at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]] with a [[two-party-preferred vote|two-party vote]] 1.3% [[swing (Australian politics)|swing]] in Wentworth, despite a 5.6% swing away from the Coalition in the state, and a 5.4% swing against them nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/Website/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-13745-152.htm|title=House of Representatives Division First Preferences|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=18 December 2007|access-date=13 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/Website/HouseTppByState-13745.htm |title=Two Part Preferred by State|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|access-date=27 April 2010}}</ref> After John Howard lost his seat of [[Division of Bennelong|Bennelong]], on 25 November 2007 [[Peter Costello]], who Howard stated publicly should succeed him, announced he would not seek the party leadership.

===Leader of the Opposition (2008–2009)===
[[File:Centralcoastpresser.jpg|thumb|right|Turnbull with Deputy Leader [[Julie Bishop]] (right) and [[Helen Coonan]] (left) in July 2009.]]
After months of consistently poor opinion polling, Turnbull [[2008 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|challenged]] [[Brendan Nelson]] for the leadership on 16 September 2008. He won the ballot by four votes and became [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]]. Later that month, Turnbull confessed that he had smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in his younger days, becoming the first Liberal Leader to make such an admission.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/turnbull-mulls-a-misspent-youth/2008/09/26/1222217438603.html|title=Turnbull mulls a misspent youth|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=26 September 2008}}</ref> In early 2009, Turnbull appointed [[Chris Kenny]], a former staffer to [[Alexander Downer]] and an ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|Advertiser]]'' journalist, as his chief of staff.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/turnbull-appoints-new-right-hand-man-20090107-7bxb.html|title=Turnbull appoints new right-hand man|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=7 January 2009}}</ref> In May 2009, Turnbull attacked the [[2009 Australian federal budget]] which came amidst the fallout from the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.smh.com.au/business/federal-budget/turnbull-responds-to-budget-20090514-b4ni.html|title=Turnbull responds to budget|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 May 2009|access-date=27 April 2010}}</ref>

In June 2009, Godwin Grech, a [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|Treasury]] civil servant, privately contacted Turnbull, alleging that a car dealer with links to the Labor Party had received preferential treatment under the OzCar program, sparking the '[[Utegate|OzCar affair]]'. Turnbull later repeated these allegations in Parliament, stating that Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] and [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Wayne Swan]] had "used their offices and taxpayers' resources to seek advantage for one of their mates and then lied about it to the Parliament" and that they needed to "either explain their actions or resign".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2009/s2603723.htm|title=PM refers OzCar allegations to inquiry|date=20 June 2009|work=[[AM (Australian radio series)|AM]]|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=25 November 2009}}</ref> On 22 June, the email Grech had secretly provided to Turnbull supporting allegation was alleged to have been faked by Grech.

On 9 April 2013, Turnbull and Tony Abbott presented their party's alternative [[National Broadband Network]] (NBN) plan.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/all-that-glitters--abbott-and-mr-broadband-hawk-the-copper-option-20130409-2hj57.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=All that glitters … Abbott and 'Mr Broadband' hawk the copper option}}</ref> The plan prioritised a modified and scaled-down NBN with "[[fiber to the x|fibre to the node]]" (FTTN) and [[Last mile|last-mile]] by [[copper conductor|copper cable]].<ref name="Kohler2013-03-10">{{cite news|author=Kohler, Alan|author-link=Alan Kohler|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-10/kohler-how-malcolm-turnbull-saved-the-nbn/4619868|title=How Malcolm Turnbull saved the NBN|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|location=Australia|date=10 April 2013 }}</ref> The new policy contrasted with the previous position which had called for the dismantling of the entire NBN.<ref name="Kohler2013-03-10" />

After the Coalition victory in the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]], Turnbull was appointed [[Minister for Communications (Australia)|Minister for Communications]] and began implementing the alternative NBN strategy. In 2014, Turnbull announced that the Vertigan Report, a [[cost–benefit analysis]] of providing fast broadband to regional and rural Australia through wireless and satellite services, revealed that continuing the plan would cost nearly {{AUD}}5&nbsp;billion and was expected to produce only {{AUD}}600&nbsp;million in economic benefits – a return of just 10%. In spite of the economic cost, Turnbull stated that whilst subsidising broadband to regional areas is "fiendishly expensive", there was no other option.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/malcolm-turnbull-nbn-plan-wont-change-despite-massive-cost-for-rural-coverage-20140827-108xja.html|title=Malcolm Turnbull: NBN plan won't change despite massive cost for rural coverage|author1=Knott, Matthew|author2=Timson, Lia|date=27 August 2014|access-date=24 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

In December 2014, Turnbull brokered a deal between the Australian Government, [[NBN Co]] and [[Telstra]] whereby NBN Co acquired Telstra's copper network and hybrid-fibre coaxial (HFC) to deliver the NBN.

{{main|February 2015 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill motion}}
Following persistent leadership tensions amidst poor opinion polling, a [[February 2015 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill motion|leadership spill motion]] was moved against Tony Abbott on 9 February 2015. Although the spill motion was defeated 61 votes to 39, Turnbull had been reported as considering a run for the leadership if the spill motion had succeeded. Before the motion Turnbull had told reporters that "if, for whatever reason, the leadership of a political party is vacant then anyone, any member of the party can stand, whether they be a minister or a backbencher, without any disloyalty to the person whose leadership has been declared vacant."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-09/tony-abbott-keeps-liberal-leadership-failed-spill-motion/6079006 ABC News 9 February 2015.] Accessed 9 February 2015.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-09/liberal-leadership-spill3a-as-it-happened/6079418 | title=Liberal leadership spill: as it happened | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | date=9 February 2015 | access-date=14 September 2015 | author=Leslie, Tim}}</ref>

On 21 March 2016, Turnbull announced that Parliament would consider bills to reinstate the [[Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner|Australian Building and Construction Commission]] (ABCC), with the bills having previously been rejected twice before. Turnbull stated if the Senate rejected the bills a third time, he would advise the Governor-General to call a [[double dissolution]] of Parliament and a federal election for 2 July.

===Energy policy===
Since the 2016 election, the Turnbull government had followed prior Coalition government energy policies. This involved the wholesale dismissal of [[mandatory renewable energy target|renewable energy targets]] and [[emissions trading|emissions intensity schemes]]. This had only hardened when [[South Australia]] faced large blackouts, which Turnbull had blamed on the state's "ambitious" renewable energy target.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/blame-game-over-rolling-blackouts-as-south-australia-promised-dramatic-overhaul-of-energy-grid/news-story/6f659cfefcead66d2599f3449f1cb2d6|title= Blame game over rolling blackouts|date= 10 February 2017|publisher=The Advertiser}}</ref> In response to the gas and energy crisis that occurred in March 2017,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-17/the-great-gas-robbery/8363798|title=The great gas robbery|date=17 March 2017|publisher=ABC News}}</ref> Malcolm Turnbull announced a 50% increase in the capacity of [[Snowy Hydro]] through "pumped hydro" technology.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.afr.com/news/politics/federal-government-to-pour-2bn-into-major-snowy-hydro-expansion-20170315-guyo3r|title= Federal Government to pour 2 billion into major Snowy Hydro expansion|date= 15 March 2017|newspaper= Australian Financial Review}}</ref>

===Same-sex marriage plebiscite===
{{see also|Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey|Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017}}
Prior to Turnbull becoming Prime Minister, the parliamentary Liberal Party voted to resolve the issue of same-sex marriage by putting the question to Australians voters via a [[referendum|plebiscite]]. Enabling legislation was rejected twice by the Senate, and so the government decided to adopt a [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey|postal plebiscite option]], which involved the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] conducting a nationwide survey asking voters whether they would like to see a change in the definition of marriage. Sending out of ballots began on 12 September 2017, as attempts to prevent the survey through a High Court challenge failed. The survey ended 7 November 2017 and results released 15 November the same year. It returned with a total of 7,817,247 (61.6%) "Yes" responses and 4,873,987 (38.4%) "No" responses.

Following the vote, after four days of debates regarding amendments which included proposals to increase religious protections to refuse services to same-sex couples, on the 7 December 2017 same-sex marriage was legalised through a parliamentary vote by the House of Representatives. The first same-sex marriages in Australia occurred as a result of the law change from 9 January 2018.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Karp|first1=Paul|title=y Marriage equality law passes Australia's parliament in landslide vote|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/marriage-equality-law-passes-australias-parliament-in-landslide-vote|website=The Guardian Australia|publisher=The Guardian Australia|access-date=7 December 2017}}</ref>

===August 2018 leadership spills===

From 21 to 23 August, tensions mounted and Dutton announced that he would seek a second spill.  Turnbull responded that, pending a report from the [[Solicitor-General of Australia]] on the eligibility of Dutton to serve in Parliament and the receipt of a petition calling for a party room meeting that bore the signatures of at least half (43) of the parliamentary party, he would call such a meeting, vacate the leadership (regarding the petition as a vote of no confidence) and not stand in the subsequent leadership election.  On the morning of 24 August, the Solicitor-General advised that Peter Dutton was "not ineligible" to serve.  Later that morning, Dutton presented to Turnbull a document calling for a party room meeting that contained the minimum 43 signatures.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hit.com.au/news/national/peter-dutton-has-delivered-a-petition-to-turnbull-demanding-a-party-meeting|title=Peter Dutton Has Delivered A Petition To Turnbull Demanding A Party Meeting|date=2018-08-24|work=hit network!|access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref>
A party meeting was then called and the leadership was spilled, with [[Scott Morrison]] elected as Turnbull's successor by 45 votes over Dutton with 40. In his final press conference as Prime Minister, Turnbull denounced Dutton and Abbott as "wreckers".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/aug/24/liberal-spill-malcolm-turnbull-peter-dutton-scott-morrison-liberal-spill-politics-parliament-live|title=Turnbull attacks 'wreckers' Abbott and Dutton as he leaves office|work=The Guardian|date=24 August 2018|access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref>

On 27 August Turnbull announced that he would resign from Parliament over the coming days. On 31 August 2018 he tendered a formal notice of resignation to the [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]].<ref name=":0" />

==Life after politics==
On 1 June 2019, Turnbull returned to the private sector as a senior advisor to major global private equity firm [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] (KKR).<ref>{{cite news|date=31 May 2019|title=Malcolm Turnbull joins global investment firm KKR|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/31/malcolm-turnbull-joins-global-investment-firm-kkr|access-date=31 May 2019}}</ref> Turnbull returned to Australia in December 2019 and appeared on the final episode of ''[[Q&A (Australian talk show)|Q&A]]'' hosted by Tony Jones on 9 December 2019.

Turnbull has publicly criticised the [[Morrison Government]] for not taking strong enough action on climate change, arguing that they should readopt his [[National Energy Guarantee]] (NEG) policy. In a piece in ''The Guardian'', he stated that, "Scott Morrison can't afford to waste the bushfire crisis when Australia urgently needs its own [[Green New Deal|green new deal]]...There are simply no more excuses. We cannot allow political prejudice and vested interests to hold us up any longer. If ever there was a crisis not to waste, it is this one. Morrison has the chance now to reinstate the NEG with higher targets. Both he and Josh Frydenberg were among its strongest supporters when I was PM. They abandoned it in the lead-up to an election, to pacify the right wing of the Coalition that sabotaged it in the first place."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Turnbull|first=Malcolm|date=2020-01-11|title=Scott Morrison can't afford to waste the bushfire crisis when Australia urgently needs its own green new deal {{!}} Malcolm Turnbull|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/12/scott-morrison-cant-afford-to-waste-the-bushfire-crisis-when-australia-urgently-needs-its-own-green-new-deal|access-date=2020-01-12|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

On 25 October 2020, Turnbull gave his support to former Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]]'s petition for a "Royal Commission to ensure a strong, diverse Australian news media" with the goal of investigating Rupert Murdoch's control over Australian news media, tweeting that he had signed it and encouraging others to follow suit.<ref>{{cite web|last=Turnbull|first=Malcolm|date=25 October 2020|title=Kevin has done well to get this petition going.
