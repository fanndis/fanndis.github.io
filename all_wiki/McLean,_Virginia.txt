==History==
The community received its name from [[John Roll McLean]], the former publisher and owner of ''The Washington Post''. Along with [[Stephen Benton Elkins]] and French aristocrat Jean-Pierre Guenard, in 1902 he bought the charter for the [[Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad]]. Completed in 1906, it connected the area with Washington, D.C. McLean named a railroad station costing $1,500, of which $500 was raised locally, after himself where the rail line (traveling on the present route of Old Dominion Drive) crossed the old Chain Bridge Road.<ref name=Station>{{cite news|title=Along the 0. D.
