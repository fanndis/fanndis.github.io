'''Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital''', founded in 1962, is a pediatric treatment and research facility focused on children's catastrophic diseases, particularly [[leukemia]] and other cancers. The hospital costs about US$2.8 million a day to run, but patients are not charged for their care.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/media-tools/facts.html#e467a6002a86d5838f59ca4fd21d88a16c446d87f7618d69fbcfcc6d9fe29ac2=6|title=St. Jude facts|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}</ref> It is located in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and is a [[nonprofit]] medical corporation designated as a [[501(c)(3)]] tax-exempt organization by the [[Internal Revenue Service]].<ref>"St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital Inc."

==History==

St. Jude was founded by entertainer [[Danny Thomas]] in 1962, with help from [[Lemuel Diggs]] and Thomas' close friend from [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], automobile dealer Anthony Abraham. The hospital was founded on the premise that "no child should die in the dawn of life".<ref>{{cite web |title=The National Shrine of St. Jude |url=http://shrineofstjude.claretians.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ssj_jude_danny_thomas&JServSessionIdr009=kyp8g74bg4.app45a|publisher=Shrineofstjude.claretians.org |access-date=2008-07-03}}</ref> This idea resulted from a promise that Thomas, a [[Maronite]] [[Catholic]], had made to a saint years before the hospital was founded. Thomas was a comedian who was struggling to get a break in his career and living paycheck to paycheck. When his first child was about to be born, he attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in [[Detroit]], and put his last $7.00 in the offering bin. He prayed to [[Jude the Apostle|Saint Jude Thaddeus]] for a means to provide for his family, and about a week later, he obtained a gig that paid 10 times what he had put in the offering bin. After that time, Thomas believed in the power of prayer.  He promised St. Jude Thaddeus that if the saint made him successful, he would one day build him a shrine. Years later, Thomas became an extremely successful comedian and built St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as a shrine to St. Jude Thaddeus to honor his promise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=576bfa2454e70110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&vgnextchannel=d48478b27119a210VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD |title=Danny's Promise |publisher=Stjude.org |access-date=2012-11-26}}</ref>

In 1957, Thomas, a [[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese-American]], founded the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]] (ALSAC), which helped him realize his dream. ALSAC is also the fundraising organization of St. Jude. Since St. Jude opened its doors in 1962, ALSAC has had the responsibility of raising the necessary funds to keep the hospital open.  Memphis was chosen at the suggestion of Catholic Cardinal [[Samuel Stritch]], a Tennessee native who had been a spiritual advisor to Thomas since he presided at Thomas's [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmation]] in Thomas's boyhood home of [[Toledo, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=d7e8fa3186e70110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&vgnextchannel=bc67ef9e87018010VgnVCM1000000e2015acRCRD |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807191901/https://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=d7e8fa3186e70110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&vgnextchannel=bc67ef9e87018010VgnVCM1000000e2015acRCRD |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-08-07 |title=Danny's Dream |publisher=Stjude.org |access-date=2011-01-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sanderson |first=Jane |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073527,00.html |title=St. Jude Children's Hospital Was Danny Thomas' Dream, but Dr. Alvin Mauer Makes It Come True |magazine=People.com |date=1979-04-30 |access-date=2011-01-14}}</ref>

Although it was named after Thomas's [[patron saint]], St. Jude is not a Catholic hospital and is a [[Secularism|secular]] institution not affiliated with any religious organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=eb00ef5d00670110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&cpsextcurrchannel=1 |title=Is this a Catholic hospital?

In 2007, [[Chili's]] restaurant chain pledged $50 million to fund the construction of the seven-story Chili's Care Center, adding {{convert|340,000|sqft|m2}}, providing space for the department of radiological services, The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, two floors of outpatient clinics, one floor of inpatient clinics and rooms, two floors of laboratory space, an office floor and an unfinished level for future expansion.

In June 2008, Kay Kafe, funded by  [[Sterling Jewelers]], was opened. The space features a lounge area, a large dining area and a variety of new dining options, providing an area where families and staff can relax away from the treatment areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2071c8109aada110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&vgnextchannel=3c9213c016118010VgnVCM1000000e2015acRCRD |title=New Kay Kafe shines bright |publisher=Stjude.org |access-date=2012-11-26}}</ref>

In 2014, the [[Marlo Thomas]] Center for Global Education and Collaboration was opened as part of the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/marlo-thomas-center-opens-at-st-jude-2014-11|title=Marlo Thomas Center Opens at St. Jude|work=WebProNews|access-date=November 23, 2014}}</ref> In 2017, the [https://www.stjude.org/education-training/st-jude-graduate-school-of-biomedical-sciences.html St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences] accepted its inaugural class of PhD students.

==Affiliated hospitals==
St. Jude is associated with several affiliated hospitals in the United States to further its efforts beyond its own physical walls. The hospital uses its Domestic Affiliates Program to form this partnership with the other pediatric programs. This program is a network of hematology clinics, hospitals, and universities that are united under the mission of St. Jude.

These sites are used as a means of referring eligible patients to St. Jude as well as a location to administer some care. Through the Domestic Affiliates Program staff at St. Jude work together and collaborate with those at the other institutions. Affiliated sites are expected to comply with standards set by St. Jude and are audited to ensure proper and quality care.<ref name="Domestic Affiliates">{{cite web |url=http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ab676f9523e70110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&vgnextchannel=216615faf7118010VgnVCM1000000e2015acRCRD |title=Domestic Affiliates |publisher=St. Jude Children's Research Hospital |access-date=2008-01-29}}</ref>

Currently the Domestic Affiliate Clinic sites include:

* [[Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center]], in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]
* [[Novant Health|Novant Health Hemby Children's Hospital]], in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]
* Huntsville Hospital for Women & Children, in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]

* The Children's Hospital at Saint Francis, in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]

St. Jude also works closely with [[Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center]], also located in downtown Memphis.  St. Jude patients needing certain procedures, such as brain surgery, may undergo procedures at LeBonheur Hospital.  Both St. Jude and Le Bonheur are teaching hospitals affiliated with the [[University of Tennessee Health Science Center]]. [[University of Tennessee]] physicians training in pediatrics, surgery, radiology, and other specialties undergo service rotations at St. Jude Hospital.

The [[Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon]] was established in [[Beirut]] on April 12, 2002. The center is an affiliate of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and works in association with the [[American University of Beirut]] Medical Center (AUBMC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cccl.org.lb/home.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412041541/http://www.cccl.org.lb/home.htm|url-status=dead|title=CCCL :: Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon|archive-date=April 12, 2007|website=cccl.org.lb}}</ref>

A commitment has been made to establish a {{US$|412 million}} research facility in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], one purpose of which will be to serve as a collaborative hub.<ref name=":0" />

==Funding==

St. Jude's is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization with annual expenses, as of 2018, of over $1.4 billion funded by nearly $1.5 billion in donations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stjude.org/about-st-jude/financials.html|title=St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital 2018 Annual Report}}</ref>  Donations for St. Jude comes from many sources, including government grants and insurance recoveries, but the principal source of funding (75% average) is from the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]] (ALSAC) - a semi-independent entity that raises funds using the name of St. Jude.<ref name="foundationcenter.org">[http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/620/620646012/620646012_201406_990.pdf]</ref> Of a dollar donated to the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]], about $0.82 goes directly to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.<ref name="foundationcenter.org"/>

All medically eligible patients who are accepted for treatment at St. Jude are treated without regard to the family's ability to pay. St. Jude is one of a few pediatric research organizations in the United States where families never pay for treatments that are not covered by insurance, and families without insurance are never asked to pay. In addition to providing medical services to eligible patients, St. Jude also assists families with transportation, lodging, and meals. Three separate specially-designed patient housing facilities— [[Tri Delta]] Place for short-term (up to one week), [[Ronald McDonald House]] for medium-term (one week to 3 months), and [[Target Corporation#Philanthropy|Target House]] for long-term (3 months or more)—provide housing for patients and up to three family members, with no cost to the patient. These policies, along with research expenses and other costs, cause the hospital to incur more than $2.4 million in operating costs each day.<ref>[http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jspvgnextoid=403c6f9523e70110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&vgnextchannel=341c13c016118010VgnVCM1000000e2015acRCRD]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>

===Philanthropic aid===
From 2000 to 2005, 83.7% of every dollar received by St. Jude went to the current or future needs of St. Jude. In 2002 to 2004, 47% of program expenses went to patient care and 41% to research.<ref name="2005 annual report">{{cite journal

To cover operating costs, ALSAC conducts many fund-raising events and activities. The [[WGC Invitational]], a [[PGA Tour]] event, is one of the most visible fund-raising events for the hospital. Other fund-raising programs include the St. Jude Math-A-Thon, Up 'til Dawn, direct mailings, radiothons and television marketing.

St. Jude also has a merchandise catalog called the Hope Catalog. The catalog contains everything from shirts to office items, and from patient art to "Give Thanks" wristbands.

===Thanks and Giving===
In November 2004, St. Jude launched its inaugural ''Thanks and Giving'' campaign which encourages consumers to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at checkout or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude. The campaign is supported by network television spots, advertisements in major publications, interactive marketing on Yahoo! and a movie trailer that runs on 20,000 screens nationwide, runs from [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] until the [[New Year]]. The campaign was created by St. Jude National Outreach Director [[Marlo Thomas]] and her siblings [[Terre Thomas]] and [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony Thomas]], children of hospital founder [[Danny Thomas]]. Customers nationwide are asked to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a [[donation]] at check out or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude.

Corporations give customers a host of opportunities to support St. Jude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ee70d4a7ac56a310VgnVCM100000290115acRCRD&vgnextchannel=e3fe7b6877115310VgnVCM100000290115acRCRD&SearchUrl=search_results.jsp&QueryText=Thanks%20and%20Giving%20campaign |title=St. Jude Children's Research Hospital launches ninth annual St. Jude Thanks and Giving campaign |publisher=Stjude.org |access-date=2013-03-04}}</ref> The ultimate goal is to increase awareness with the hope that people will come to identify Thanksgiving with St. Jude, said Joyce Aboussie, vice chairwoman of the nonprofit's board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/thanks-and-giving-st-judes-brands-a-holiday-2968 |title=Thanks and Giving: St Judes Brands A Holiday |publisher=TheNonProfitTimes |access-date=2012-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117032718/http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/thanks-and-giving-st-judes-brands-a-holiday-2968 |archive-date=2013-01-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The official kick-off event for the Thanks and Giving campaign is the Give Thanks Walk.

===Other funding initiatives===
One of the hospital's most recent and successful fund-raising efforts has been the Dream Home Giveaway.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dreamhome.stjude.org/about |title=About St. Jude Dream Home Giveaway |publisher=St. Jude Children's Research Hospital |access-date=January 29, 2008}}</ref> The giveaway allows contest entrants to reserve tickets for $100 each to qualify to win homes valued between $300,000 and $600,000. The Dream Home Giveaway, one of the largest national fund-raising programs, is conducted in cities across the United States.

Many high schools around the country are creating student-led and student-run organizations called Team Up for St. Jude. These programs consist of high school students putting on events that raise funds and awareness for St. Jude while showing their school spirit. One of the main events is a letter-writing campaign in which the students are sent pre-written letters that include stories of a patient and ask for donations. The high school students often have a "letter-writing party" to address and send the letters to their family and friends asking them to support St. Jude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=801b251d2b175110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&vgnextchannel=368150c1c5175110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD|title=Team Up for St. Jude|publisher=St. Jude Children's Research Hospital}}</ref> 
Hoover High School (Hoover, AL) has a program that has brought in many fundraising ideas including "Team Up Week" which consists of prize wheels, inflatables, karaoke, cake walk, etc. to raise funds and awareness for the hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hooverhigh.al.hch.schoolinsites.com/?PageName='OrganizationPage'&Page='Calendar'&OrganizationID='23465' |title= TEAM-UP -St. Jude |publisher=Hoover High School |location=Hoover, AL}}</ref> Though this program is done on a much a smaller scale than the college program Up 'til Dawn, it has the potential to grow and increase awareness.

The fraternity's second core belief, "I Believe in Service... service to the college; service to every group organized for the common good; service to the individual. I believe in service defined in the terms of voluntary sacrifice for the welfare of those with whom I come in contact." has helped shape many young men of admirable quality and exceptional character towards a dedication to St. Jude and other equally important causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phimudelta.publishpath.com/the-founders-creed|title=The Founder's Creed}}</ref>

In July 2010, Tri Delta completed its "10 by 10" goal, raising over $10 million in less than four years, six years short of the original goal. Those funds were used to sponsor the Tri Delta Patient Care Floor in the Chili's Care Center. Upon completion of the "10 by 10" campaign, the sorority announced a new fundraising goal of $15 million in 5 years to name the Specialty Clinic located in the Patient Care Center.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tridelta.org/news/03_01_2011 |title=Join us in celebrating Tri Delta's St. Jude month! |publisher=Tridelta.org |access-date=2012-05-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909061853/http://www.tridelta.org/news/03_01_2011 |archive-date=2012-09-09 }}</ref> Three and a half years later, Delta Delta Delta had raised $15 million and completed its goal ahead of schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/7/prweb9667489.htm |title=Tri Delta Celebrates Raising $4.2 Million in One Year for St. Jude |publisher=Prweb.com |access-date=2012-11-26}}</ref> In July 2014, the on-campus residence center was renamed Tri Delta Place as a result of [[Tri Delta]]'s pledge of $60 Million in 10 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tridelta.org/news/trideltaplace|title=Tri Delta Place|publisher=Tridelta.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819090129/http://www.tridelta.org/news/trideltaplace|archive-date=2014-08-19}}</ref>

In July 2005, [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] (ΚΑΨ) fraternity announced St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as its national philanthropic partner. Since that time, members across the country have joined in the fight against pediatric cancer, sickle cell disease, and other catastrophic illnesses. Kappa Alpha Psi has answered the call to service by raising more than $400,000—representing the largest contribution that Kappa Alpha Psi has donated to any charity. Members of Kappa Alpha Psi have committed to raise $500,000 in support of the hospital's sickle cell program. St. Jude has one of the largest pediatric sickle cell research and treatment programs in the world. St. Jude is the first known hospital in the world to cure sickle cell disease through bone marrow transplantation. Today, bone marrow transplantation still offers the only cure for sickle cell disease. Members of Kappa Alpha Psi reach out to churches in their local communities to host a Sunday of Hope each January in support of St. Jude. January was selected because this is the month of Kappa's founding. During the Sunday of Hope, churches will take up a special offering in honor of the patients and families of St. Jude. At the 2008 ALSAC/St. Jude Board and Awards Dinner, Kappa Alpha Psi received the Volunteer Group of the Year Award for their efforts in the inaugural year of the Sunday of Hope program which secured more than 130 churches to participate and raised more than $280,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=e8e465cad7e70110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&vgnextchannel=3dd6beac040b2110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD |title=Kappa Alpha Psi |publisher=Stjude.org |access-date=2011-01-14}}</ref>

[[Lambda Theta Alpha]] sorority serves thousands of hours each year to a variety of philanthropic causes and needs. In the effort to create a more united and bigger impact nationally, Lambda Theta Alpha selected a national philanthropy. In January 2010, LTA became an official collegiate partner to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, becoming the first individual Latino Greek organization to commit fully to the hospital's efforts. LTA has pledged to raise awareness about childhood cancer and St. Jude in the Latin community, as well as fundraise for the hospital through a variety of events and programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=20bc294fed41d210VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&vgnextchannel=f86c294fed41d210VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD |title=Lambda Theta Alpha |publisher=stjude.org |access-date=2013-04-03}}</ref><ref name="Philanthropy">{{cite web|url=http://lta.orgsync.com/Philanthropy |title=Philanthropy |publisher=Lambda Theta Alpha |access-date=2013-04-03}}</ref>

Past events have included: sporting tournaments, charity galas, informational meetings, and much more.<ref name="Philanthropy"/>

Another successful event is the Country Cares for St. Jude Kids radiothon. During these events, country radio stations around the country allow those touched by St. Jude to share stories with listeners, highlighting patient stories, and having exciting promotions. Listeners are encouraged to call in and become a Partner In Hope by making either a one-time or monthly donation to the hospital. The 200 stations involved have helped raise over $400 million since 1989. Country artists have also supported St. Jude through concerts, hospital visits, call-ins, and other forms of support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrycares.org/|title=Country Cares Home Page|publisher=Country Cares}}</ref>
Since 2001 the St. Jude Memphis Marathon has raised over $90 million for the kids and families at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. St. Jude Heroes participate in the race and fundraise with friends and family via social media and word of mouth.

[[Eagles for St. Jude]] was a program created in 2007 by [[Stanford Financial Group]], when it paid to become title sponsor of the [[St. Jude Classic]], the annual PGA Tour event in Memphis. The program, and sponsorship, ended in February 2009, when it was found that  Stanford Financial Group was nothing more than a [[Ponzi scheme]], having defrauded investors out of $8 billion, with a small fraction of that stolen money having been channeled into the Eagles for St. Jude program.<ref name="Driver">{{Cite news |first=Anna |last=Driver |title=U.S. charges Stanford with massive Ponzi scheme |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE51Q66G20090228 |work=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=27 February 2009 |access-date=28 February 2009 }}</ref>

===McDonald's Monopoly Game===
In 1995, St. Jude received an anonymous letter postmarked in [[Dallas]], Texas, containing a $1 million winning [[McDonald's Monopoly]] game piece.
