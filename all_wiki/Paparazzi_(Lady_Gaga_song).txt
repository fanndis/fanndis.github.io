"'''Paparazzi'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] from her debut studio album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008). It was released as the album's fifth and final single by [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga wrote and produced the song with [[Rob Fusari]]. The song portrays Gaga's struggles in her quest for fame, as well as balancing success and love. Musically, it is an uptempo [[techno-pop]] and [[dance-pop]] song whose lyrics describe a stalker following somebody to grab attention and fame.

The single was released on July 6, 2009, in the United Kingdom and four days later in Australia. "[[LoveGame]]" initially had been planned as the third single release in the UK, but when its lyrics and music video were deemed potentially controversial, it was decided that "Paparazzi" would be released instead. "Paparazzi" was critically acclaimed for its "fun-filled" and club-friendly nature. It was also commercially successful, reaching top-ten positions in the music charts of Australia, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States and topping the charts in the Czech Republic, Germany and Scotland.

The accompanying music video was directed by [[Jonas Åkerlund]] and portrays Gaga as a doomed starlet, hounded by photographers, who is almost killed by her boyfriend (played by [[Alexander Skarsgård]]). It shows her survival, comeback, revenge on her boyfriend, and experiences on the way to fame. The video won two [[MTV Video Music Award]]s in 2009 for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects|Best Special Effects]]. Gaga performed the song at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]] in a performance art piece symbolizing the negative effect of fame leading to death. Additional live performances of the song took place on her concert tours, more recently the [[Joanne World Tour]] (2017–2018).

==Background and release==
{{Quote box |quote  = What am I really trying to say here? What will the act of me writing this song really do? Me making a conscious decision to write about the [[paparazzi]] – I thought about performance art and shock art and how [[Paris Hilton]] and her sister and [[Lindsay Lohan]] and [[Nicole Richie]] are shock artists in their own way. They're not necessarily doing fine arts – something they put in the museums – but it's an art form. That's what this song is trying to say. |source = —Gaga talking about the different aspects of the song.<ref name="ehqueenofpop"/> |width  = 30% |align  = right

By 2008, Gaga relocated to Los Angeles in order to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'', and set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga. "Paparazzi" was one of the songs written by Gaga and Fusari who also produced the track.<ref name="ehqueenofpop">{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Emily|year=2010|title=[[Lady Gaga: Queen of Pop]]|publisher=[[John Blake Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-84454-963-4|pages=67–74}}</ref> In a 2009 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gaga recalled her relationship with a heavy metal drummer called Luke, who became an inspiration for most of the songs on ''The Fame'', including "Paparazzi".

She was infatuated with Luke, calling him "the love of her life", and ready to be his fan, to turn the camera around and photograph him.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-new-york-doll-rolling-stones-2009-cover-story-20090611|title=Lady Gaga, New York Doll|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|date=June 11, 2009|accessdate=September 6, 2014|work=Rolling Stone|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904061206/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-new-york-doll-rolling-stones-2009-cover-story-20090611|archivedate=September 4, 2014}}</ref>

To the Australian ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'', Gaga explained that "Paparazzi" was about struggling to balance success and love.<ref name="radiogaga">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/radio-gaga/story-e6frf039-1225737678506?nk=c2d6dc4f3dd5636acea090ce18e41580|title=Radio GaGa|last=Hutchinson|first=Jane|date=June 21, 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=June 22, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111806/http://musique.fnac.com/a2781646/Lady-Gaga-Paparazzi-CD-single?SID=900221b4-c8be-adcb-7347-e704dd268309&Fr=0&UID=0D3F80870-19DE-6F5A-C5E7-99304B1557DC&To=0&Nu=2&from=1&Origin=FnacAff&OrderInSession=0&Mn=-1&Ra=-28|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> Further explanations said that the song was about trying to win the paparazzi and the media in one's favor. "It's a love song for the cameras, but it's also a love song about fame or love – can you have both, or can you only have one", she concluded. "Paparazzi" was the album's third single in Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom, the fourth in Canada and the United States and the fifth in Australia, France and New Zealand. Although released on July 6, 2009, in the United Kingdom and four days later in Australia, "[[LoveGame]]" initially had been planned as the third single release in the former but deeming its lyrics and music video potentially controversial, it was decided that "Paparazzi" would be released instead.<ref name="ehqueenofpop"/>

"It has a real, genuine, powerful message about fame-whoring and death and the demise of the celebrity, and what that does to young people.

These are some of the major themes in the video.<ref name="cp24"/>

===Synopsis===
[[File:Paparazzi - Music video - Crutches scene.jpg|thumb|Gaga wearing a metallic leotard—a reference to the film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927)—with matching helmet while attempting to walk with the help of crutches in the music video for "Paparazzi".|alt=Refer to caption]]
The music video is seven minutes long. Swedish actor [[Alexander Skarsgård]] plays Gaga's boyfriend. The video features a murderous plot line involving a doomed starlet who is constantly followed by photographers. The video opens with a shot of a seaside mansion, where Gaga and her boyfriend are shown lying on a bed talking in Swedish. They move to the balcony and start making out; however, when hidden photographers start taking pictures of them, Gaga realizes that her boyfriend has set the paparazzi to photograph her and tries to stop him. Her struggles nevertheless remain futile even when she punches him, and in a final frantic attempt at defense, she smashes a nearby bottle of liquor into his face. The enraged boyfriend throws her over the balcony. Gaga lies on the ground in her own blood as the photographers continue to take pictures of her bloody body and tabloid headlines proclaim that her career is over.<ref name="mtvleak"/> According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', this scene pays homage to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958).<ref name="rollingrec"/>

Later, Gaga is shown getting out of a limousine, being carried by male dancers to a wheelchair. It is during this scene that the song starts.<ref name="ewvideo">{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/05/29/lady-gagas-papa/|title=Lady GaGa's new 'Paparazzi' video/mini-movie: We have no words|last=Semigran|first=Aly|date=May 29, 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=June 1, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117104815/http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/05/29/lady-gagas-papa/|archivedate=November 17, 2009}}</ref> As the dancers gyrate around her, she starts walking down the carpet with the help of a pair of crutches while wearing a metallic bustier and a matching helmet. The metallic outfit is a reference to the film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). These scenes are interspersed with scenes of dead models lying around the mansion.<ref name="mtvleak"/> Next Gaga is shown on a golden couch where she makes out with a trio of [[hair metal]] rockers during the line "Loving you is cherry pie". The trio, which consist of the triplets Calle "Kelii" Landeberg, Nisse "Izzy" Landeberg, and Pelle "Rock" Landeberg are known as Snake of Eden and they are from the reality television dating program ''[[Daisy of Love]]''.<ref name="ewvideo"/> According to [[MTV]], this scene is a reference to the song "[[Cherry Pie (Warrant song)|Cherry Pie]]" by American [[glam band]] [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]]. The video continues through the intermediate [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] with Gaga wearing a dress made up of film strips and a towering feathered [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] headdress.<ref name="mtvleak"/>

In the next scene, Gaga and her eye-patch wearing boyfriend are reading magazines on a sofa in a tea room. Gaga wears a yellow jumpsuit with circular glasses and shoulder pads. ''[[The Guardian]]'' compared this look with that of [[Minnie Mouse]].<ref name="guardianvideo"/> She finally takes her revenge on her boyfriend by discreetly poisoning his drink with white powder concealed in her ring. As he falls dead, Gaga calls [[9-1-1]] and declares that she just killed her boyfriend. The police arrive at the mansion and arrest Gaga who, wearing a tall ice cream cone corkscrew wig, walks to the police car as the paparazzi surround her once again.<ref name="mtvleak"/> Images flash by, with newspapers proclaiming her innocence and that Gaga is back in the spotlight and has regained her fame. The video ends with Gaga posing for mug shots like a fashion model while wearing a tulip shaped metallic dress similar to the single cover.

===Reception===
''Rolling Stone'' writer Daniel Kreps compared the video with the 1992 music video for "[[November Rain]]" by [[Guns N' Roses]]. He described the scenes of the dead models as stomach-turning while complimenting the video for "brimming with cinematic style [so] that it's hard to take your eyes off it, though it will likely be labeled as a little self-indulgent." He also commented on the leaking of the video, saying that it "warranted more than just a simple leak; it deserved a red carpet."<ref name="rollingrec">{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gagas-sexy-cinematic-paparazzi-video-hits-the-web-20090529|title=Lady Gaga's Sexy, Cinematic "Paparazzi" Video Hits the Web|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=May 29, 2009|work=Rolling Stone|issn=0035-791X|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924202533/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gagas-sexy-cinematic-paparazzi-video-hits-the-web-20090529|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref> Anna Pickard from ''[[The Guardian]]'' complimented the video saying that "quite a lot of work has gone into it".

"Paparazzi" was performed at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], which began with Gaga lying on the floor, on a set that was described as an ornate mansion.<ref name="MTV VMA performance">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1621395/lady-gaga-lets-it-bleed-during-eye-popping-vma-performance/|title=Lady Gaga Lets It Bleed During Eye-Popping VMA Performance|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=September 13, 2009|publisher=MTV|accessdate=March 14, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715042104/http://www.mtv.com/news/1621395/lady-gaga-lets-it-bleed-during-eye-popping-vma-performance/|archivedate=July 15, 2014}}</ref> She stumbled across the stage and did choreographed dance moves, finally ending up playing a piano. The final chorus involved theatrical blood dripping from Gaga's ribcage as Gaga collapsed on the stage wailing in agony and one of the dancers gently lifted her. Gaga then hung lifeless with one hand rising above her dancers and blood smeared on her face with a golden halo being projected on the screen behind her.<ref name="MTV VMA performance"/> Gaga dedicated the performance to her fans.<ref name="MTV VMA comment">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-dedicates-vmas-performance-to-her-fans-inside-the-afterparties-74106/|title=Lady Gaga Dedicates VMAs Performance to Her Fans: Inside the Afterparties|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=September 14, 2009|accessdate=March 1, 2019|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Ashley Laderer from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' opined that "this was the performance that really made Lady Gaga.

She wore an emerald green dress by Thierry Mugler, and was attacked by a giant, mechanical [[Angler fish]]. Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a leotard of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with the sparks from the bra.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/lady-gaga-launches-monster-ball-883495|title=Lady Gaga launches Monster Ball tour at MEN Arena|last=Bourne|first=Dianne|date=February 18, 2010|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|accessdate=February 24, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316141142/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/lady-gaga-launches-monster-ball-883495|archivedate=March 16, 2014}}</ref>
