The '''Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research''' is dedicated to finding a cure for [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) through funded research and ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. Established by [[Michael J. Fox]] in 2000,<ref name= founder/> the Foundation has since become the largest non-profit funder of Parkinson's disease research in the world, investing more than $650 million in research to date.<ref>[https://www.michaeljfox.org/ The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research]</ref> In 2010, the Foundation launched the first large-scale clinical study on evolution [[biomarker]]s of the disease at a cost of $45 million over five years.<ref name="Fox_biomarkers">{{cite news| url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/publication-detail.html?id=243&category=4 | title=Michael J. Fox Foundation Launches $45M Parkinson Biomarker Initiative| date=2012-09-28}}</ref> The organization hosts the [[Fox Trial Finder]], which is a website for presenting [[clinical trial]]s in [[Parkinson's disease clinical research]]. 

==Research funding==
The Foundation targets people's high-risk, "translational" research—the work of translating basic scientific discoveries into simple treatments with definition to benefit the estimated five million people living with Parkinson's disease today.<ref>[https://www.michaeljfox.org/research/index.html Our Research: The Michael J. Fox Foundation]</ref>

The Foundation  drives progress by awarding grants to ensure that the most promising research avenues are thoroughly funded, explored and carried forward toward pharmacy shelves.<ref>[https://www.michaeljfox.org/research/apply-for-grant.html Funding Opportunities: The Michael J. Fox Foundation]</ref> The Foundation's four annually recurring ''Pipeline Programs'' aim to speed research along the drug development pipeline.<ref>[https://www.michaeljfox.org/research/priority-area-detail.php?pipeline-strategy Pipeline Programs: The Michael J. Fox Foundation]</ref> The ''Pipeline Programs'' include:

''Rapid Response Innovation Awards'' quickly support high-risk, high-reward projects with little to no existing preliminary data, but potential to significantly impact our understanding or treatment of PD (an Edmond J. Safra Core Program for PD Research).

''Target Validation Awards'' provide support for work demonstrating whether modulation of a novel biological target has impact in a PD-relevant pre-clinical model — an essential step to the development of potential targeted therapies (an Edmond J. Safra Core Program for PD Research).

''Clinical Intervention Awards'' support clinical testing of promising PD therapies that may significantly and fundamentally improve treatment of PD (an Edmond J. Safra Core Program for PD Research).

''Therapeutics Development Initiative'', an industry-exclusive support program for preclinical development of Parkinson's disease therapies with potential to fundamentally alter disease course and/or improve treatment of symptoms above and beyond current standards of care.

The ''Pipeline Programs'' are complemented by the Foundation's ''Critical Challenges in Parkinson's Disease'' program, which provides funds for top research priorities.<ref>[https://www.michaeljfox.org/research/research-strategy.html Critical Challenges: The Michael J. Fox Foundation]</ref> ''Critical Challenges'' in 2009/2010 include: speeding research on PD genetic targets, [[LRRK2]] and [[alpha-synuclein]]; advancing research on [[neurotrophic factors]]; identifying [[biomarkers]] of PD; understanding patient's unmet needs, like postural instability and gait disturbances; and, promoting collaborations with the Arizona Parkinson's Disease Consortium.

'''Team Fox for Parkinson's Research''' is the foundation's grassroots community project raising funds and awareness for Parkinson's disease.

==Education and awareness==
The Michael J. Fox Foundation publishes a print newsletter ''The Fox Focus'' two times per year as well as a monthly e-newsletter, FoxFlash, to keep supporters updated on Parkinson's research progress.<ref>[https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/publications.html Our Publications: The Michael J. Fox Foundation]</ref> In 2010, the Foundation launched an audio podcast series on Parkinson's science, hosted by KQED Public Radio Host David Iverson.<ref>[https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/news.html?tagid=414 Podcasts: The Michael J. Fox Foundation]</ref> ''Living with Parkinson's'' is the Foundation's online source for information on PD (including an animation about how the brain is affected by Parkinson's), guides for the newly diagnosed and caregivers, stories from people living with the disease and additional resources.<ref>[https://www.michaeljfox.org/understanding-parkinsons/living-with-pd.html Living with Parkinson's: The Michael J. Fox Foundation]</ref>

In 2016, it created a raffle to raise awareness for Parkinson's disease and raised $6.75 million through Nike and two auctions in [[Hong Kong]] and [[London]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/nike-mag-raffle-reportedly-raised-s675-million-for-parkinsons-research-news.24878.html?|title=The Michael J.
