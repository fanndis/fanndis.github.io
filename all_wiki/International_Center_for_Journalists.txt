'''International Center for Journalists''' ('''ICFJ''') is a non-profit, professional organization located in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, that promotes journalism worldwide.  Since 1984, the International Center for Journalists has worked directly with more than 70,000 journalists from 180 countries over 27 years. ICFJ offers hands-on training, workshops, seminars, fellowships and international exchanges to reporters and media managers around the globe.

==History==

ICFJ was founded in 1984 by Tom Winship, Jim Ewing, and George Krimsky, three prominent U.S. journalists, to support their fellow journalists abroad, especially those in countries with poor or non-existent free press systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icfj.org/about/about/founders|title=Founders|work=ICFJ|accessdate=May 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520004622/http://www.icfj.org/about/about/founders|archive-date=May 20, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> They believed that the proper role of the news media is to expose, investigate, and articulate issues of concern to average citizens and wished to propagate these ideals across the globe. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 2006, ICFJ established the ICFJ Founders Award for Excellence in Journalism as a tribute to Winship, Ewing and Krimsky. This award is presented to a journalist with a long-time commitment to the highest standards of the profession. Past recipients include CBS News' [[Bob Schieffer]] (2006), NBC News' [[Tom Brokaw]] (2007), The New York Times' [[John F. Burns]] (2008) and investigative journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] (2009).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
