==History==
Archbishop of Perth [[Matthew Gibney]] invited eight sisters of St [[John of God]] to Western Australia in 1895 to help people with [[typhoid fever]] during the [[Western Australian gold rushes|1890s gold rush]]. He provided land for them to set up a hospital in a timber building in Subiaco, which opened on 19 April 1898 with fifteen beds, increased to thirty by 1900. The hospital accepted all patients – private, reduce-fee and free-bed – regardless of denomination, and distributed them throughout the buildings so that sisters were unaware of their status.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=St John of God hospitals|encyclopedia=[[Historical Encyclopedia of Western Australia]]|year=2009|publisher=University of Western Australia Press|first=Phil|last=Brown|editor-first=Jenny|editor-last=Gregory|editor2-first=Jan|editor2-last=Gothard|page=839|url=https://ap01.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/view/delivery/61UWA_INST/12334498990002101|accessdate=12 June 2020|isbn=9781921401152}}</ref><ref>Sisters of St John of God, [http://www.ssjg.org.au/story/index.html "Our Founding Story"], Retrieved 2011-02-28. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216060054/http://www.ssjg.org.au/story/index.html|date=2004-12-16}}</ref>
