'''WRC-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 4 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 34), is an [[NBC]] [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to the American [[List of capitals in the United States#Capitals of the United States|capital city]] of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, District of Columbia]]. Owned by the [[NBC Owned Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[NBCUniversal]] (itself a subsidiary of [[Comcast]]), it is [[sister station|sister]] to [[Class A television service|Class A]] [[Telemundo]] owned-and-operated station [[WZDC-CD]] (channel 44) and [[regional sports network]] [[NBC Sports Washington]]. WRC-TV and WZDC-CD share studios and transmitter facilities on Nebraska Avenue in the [[Tenleytown]] neighborhood of [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest Washington]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Digital Signal Sources |work=The Washington Post |date=May 20, 2008 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/05/20/GR2008052000207.html?sid=ST2008051902978 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180601144936/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/05/20/GR2008052000207.html?sid=ST2008051902978 |archivedate=June 1, 2018  }}</ref>

WRC-TV houses and originates [[NBC News]]' Washington bureau, out of which the network's (and television's) long-running political events program, ''[[Meet the Press]]'', is based.

On [[cable television|cable]], the station is available on [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]] channel 24 in Washington, D.C. ([[C-SPAN]] is carried on cable channel 4) and channel 4 in the [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] suburbs, and on [[Cox Communications]], [[RCN Corporation|RCN]] and [[Verizon FiOS]] channel 4.

==History==
[[File:WRC-TV.jpg|thumb|right|225px|WRC-TV's studio/transmitter facility, which also houses NBC's Washington operations, have been in use since 1958. (1962 photograph)]]
The station traces its roots to [[history of television|experimental television]] station '''W3XNB''', which was put on the air by the [[Radio Corporation of America]], the then-parent company of NBC, in 1939. A construction permit with the commercial [[call signs in North America|callsign]] '''WNBW''' (standing for "<u>NB</u>C <u>W</u>ashington") was first issued on channel 3 (60–66&nbsp;MHz, numbered channel 2 prior to 1946)<ref>{{cite web |title=Whatever Happened To Channel 1? |url=http://www.tech-notes.tv/History&Trivia/Channel%20One/Channel_1.htm}}</ref> on December 23, 1941. NBC requested this permit to be cancelled on June 29, 1942; channel 3 was reallocated to [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=WRC-TV History Cards |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=86800 |website=FCC CDBS}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Staff |title=Four FM Permits Cancelled by FCC |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1942/1942-07-27-BC.pdf |work=Broadcasting |date=July 27, 1942 |page=18}}</ref>

On June 27, 1947, WNBW was re-licensed on channel 4 and signed on the air. Channel 4 is the second-oldest commercially licensed television station in Washington, after [[WTTG]] (channel 5), which signed on six months earlier in January 1947. WNBW was also the second of the five original NBC-owned television stations to sign-on, behind [[WNBC|WNBT]]/[[New York City]] and ahead of [[WMAQ-TV|WNBQ]]/[[Chicago]], [[WKYC|WNBK]]/[[Cleveland]] and [[KNBC|KNBH]]/[[Los Angeles]]. The station was operated alongside WRC radio (980 AM, now [[WTEM]], and 93.9 FM, now [[WKYS]]).

On October 18, 1954, the television station's callsign changed to the present '''WRC-TV''' to match its radio sisters.<ref>"RCA replaces NBC in O&O calls." ''Broadcasting – Telecasting'', October 4, 1954, pg. 78. [http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/54-OCR/1954-10-04-BC-0078.pdf]{{dead link|date=July 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> The new calls reflected NBC's ownership at the time by RCA. It has retained its "-TV" suffix to this day, nearly four decades after the radio stations were sold off and changed call letters.

In 1955, while in college and serving as a puppeteer on a WRC-TV program, [[Jim Henson]] was asked to create a puppet show for the station. The series he created, ''[[Sam and Friends]]'', was the first series to feature [[the Muppets]], and launched the [[Jim Henson Company]].<ref name=1EPC>{{cite book|last1=Sickels|first1=Robert C.|title=100 Entertainers Who Changed America: An Encyclopedia of Pop Culture Luminaries [2 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of Pop Culture Luminaries|date=Aug 8, 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598848311|pages=253–258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXCjAQAAQBAJ&q=Rowlf+the+Dog+commercials+Purina+Dog+Chow&pg=PA254|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}</ref>

The second presidential debate between candidates [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard M. Nixon]] was broadcast from the station's studios on October 7, 1960. [[David Brinkley]]'s Washington segment of the ''[[Huntley-Brinkley Report]]'' originated at WRC-TV between 1956 and 1970, as did Washington reports or commentaries by Brinkley or [[John Chancellor]] on ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' in the 1970s.

The earliest [[color television|color]] videotape in existence is a recording of the dedication of NBC/WRC's Washington studios on May 22, 1958. As [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] spoke at the event, introduced by NBC President Robert W. Sarnoff, it was also the first time a U.S. president had been videotaped in color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/rca-nbc_firsts.html |title=RCA-NBC Firsts in Color Television |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206115435/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/rca-nbc_firsts.html |archivedate=February 6, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKqHZcXvUAs|title=Eisenhower WRC-TV 1958 (oldest known colour videotaping)|work=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412214727/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKqHZcXvUAs|archivedate=April 12, 2015}}</ref>

At the time of its sign-on, channel 4 was one of two wholly network-owned stations in Washington, the other being [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]'s WTTG. DuMont was shut down in 1956, and for the next 30 years WRC-TV was Washington's only network [[owned-and-operated station]]. That distinction ended when WTTG was sold to the [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]], regaining its status as a network owned-and-operated station upon it becoming a charter station for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on its startup in 1986; it has since been accompanied by [[WDCA]] (channel 20) as [[UPN]] was owned by the station's owner [[Viacom (1971–2005)|Viacom]] until 2001 when Viacom traded the station to Fox (it is currently affiliated with the [[MyNetworkTV]] programming service). Today, WRC is one of three network-owned stations in the nation's capital, alongside the [[Fox Television Stations]]-owned [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] of WTTG and WDCA.

===Telemundo affiliation===
In September 2017, NBC announced they were to launch a new [[Telemundo]] owned-and-operated station based out of WRC-TV. [[ZGS Communications]], owner of Washington's existing Telemundo affiliate [[WZDC-CD]] (channel 25), sold the station's channel allocation in the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC)'s 2017–18 [[Spectrum reallocation#Broadcast incentive auction|incentive auction]], accepting a $66 million payout to turn off its signal and continue operations by sharing the channel of another station. A Telemundo spokesperson stated that the sale of WZDC's spectrum "gave us the ability to take back the Telemundo affiliation for this market," without elaborating what that meant.<ref>{{cite news|title=Telemundo Launching a Washington O&O in December|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/telemundo-launching-washington-oo-december/168520|author=Diana Marszalek|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=September 11, 2017|accessdate=September 12, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912022554/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/telemundo-launching-washington-oo-december/168520|archivedate=September 12, 2017}}</ref><ref name="dcbizjournal-tmddc">{{cite news|title=NBCUniversal to launch Telemundo station|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/09/12/nbc-washington-to-launch-telemundo-station.html|newspaper=Washington Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=September 12, 2017|accessdate=September 13, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913231006/https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/09/12/nbc-washington-to-launch-telemundo-station.html|archivedate=September 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name="mediamoves-tmddc">{{cite web|title=Telemundo ends affiliate deal with ZGS to launch O&O in D.C.|url=https://www.mediamoves.com/2017/09/telemundo-ends-affiliate-deal-with-zgs-to-launch-oo-in-d-c.html|website=Media Moves|date=September 11, 2017|accessdate=September 13, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912102526/https://www.mediamoves.com/2017/09/telemundo-ends-affiliate-deal-with-zgs-to-launch-oo-in-d-c.html|archivedate=September 12, 2017}}</ref> NBC later purchased WZDC-CD with the intention of moving its over-the-air signal to that of WRC-TV through a channel-sharing agreement.<ref name="tvnc-saletotelemundo">{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Mark K.|title=NBCU Adding ZGS Stations To Telemundo|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/109362/nbcu-adding-zgs-stations-to-telemundo|accessdate=December 4, 2017|work=TVNewsCheck|date=December 4, 2017|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206074450/http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/109362/nbcu-adding-zgs-stations-to-telemundo|archivedate=December 6, 2017}}</ref>

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WRC-TV shut down its analog signal, on [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition [[UHF]] channel 48.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829004251/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 29, 2013 |title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and the Second Rounds |accessdate=March 24, 2012}}</ref> Through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]], digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 4.

The station participated in the "[[Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act|Analog Nightlight]]" program, with its analog signal carrying information on the digital transition until analog signal broadcasts were permanently discontinued on June 26, 2009.

Beginning in 1996, WRC-TV's studios were the home of '''WHD-TV''', an experimental [[high-definition television|high definition]] television station owned by a [[consortium]] of industry groups and stations which carried the nation's first program in the format transmitted by a television station, an episode of ''[[Meet the Press]]'',<ref>http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/consumer-household-electronics-high/7693519-1.html</ref> and aired on UHF channel 34 to provide the FCC and the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] a channel to conduct many experiments in the new format.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/03/business/warts-and-wrinkles-can-t-hide-from-high-definition-tv.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Warts and Wrinkles Can't Hide From High-Definition TV | first=Joel | last=Brinkley | date=March 3, 1997 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228133830/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/03/business/warts-and-wrinkles-can-t-hide-from-high-definition-tv.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 | archivedate=December 28, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldradio.com/current/bc_dtv.htm|title=DTV Broadcast History|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211152730/http://www.oldradio.com/current/bc_dtv.htm|archivedate=February 11, 2009}}</ref> WHD-TV was discontinued around 2002.

==Programming==
[[File:Mac McGarry - It's Academic.jpg|thumb|200px|The late Mac McGarry was the original host of ''It's Academic'' until June 2011. (Photo is from ''[[circa|c.]]'' 2009.)]]
As of September 2019, [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs broadcast by WRC-TV include ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', ''[[The Kelly Clarkson Show]]'' (both are produced by sister station KNBC), and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', among others.

Because of its ownership by the network, WRC-TV generally carries the entire NBC network schedule, though the station airs an alternate live feed of ''NBC Nightly News'' at 7 p.m. (rather than 6:30&nbsp;p.m. as with most NBC stations in the [[Eastern Time Zone]]), due to a longtime hour-long 6 p.m. newscast. The weekend edition of the network's newscast airs at its usual 6:30&nbsp;p.m. time slot. Like network flagship WNBC, it airs ''Meet the Press'' an hour-and-a-half later than most NBC affiliates in the Eastern Time Zone due to a two-hour Sunday morning newscast.

WRC-TV's building is home to ''Meet the Press'', the longest-running program in U.S. broadcast television history, which debuted on November 6, 1947 and ''[[It's Academic]]'', which premiered in 1961 and is the longest-running [[game show]] in television history according to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''. ''Sam and Friends'', Jim Henson's late-night precursor to ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', got its start on WRC-TV on May 9, 1955. WRC-TV was served as the production facilities for the original run of ''[[The McLaughlin Group]]'' from its premiere in 1982 until May 2008, when the production facilities moved to [[Tegna Inc.]]-owned [[CBS]] affiliate and WRC-TV's rival [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]] and it remained until the original show's ending in 2016.

===Sports programming===
WRC-TV has been the over-the-air home of Washington Redskins (now the [[Washington Football Team]]) preseason games since [[2009 Washington Redskins season|2009]]. Before the Comcast-NBC Universal merger, games were only shown in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] on WRC, with actual rightsholder CSN Mid-Atlantic (now [[NBC Sports Washington]]) exclusively airing the high definition broadcast. In addition, all of the team's games aired via NBC's broadcast contract with the NFL are also broadcast (from [[1970 Washington Redskins season|1970]] to [[1997 Washington Redskins season|1997]], these were games in which the team played host to an [[American Football Conference|AFC]] team, since 2006, all [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday night games]] are shown on WRC-TV). The station aired coverage of the Redskins' victory in [[Super Bowl XVII]].

In addition, all [[Washington Capitals]] games broadcast through [[NHL on NBC|NBC's broadcast contract]] with the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] are also broadcast; this included the team's first-ever [[Stanley Cup Final]] victory in [[2018 Stanley Cup Final|2018]].

WRC-TV also aired games involving the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Washington Wizards|Washington Bullets/Wizards]] from [[1990–91 Washington Bullets season|1990]] to [[2001–02 Washington Wizards season|2002]] via [[NBA on NBC|NBC's broadcast rights to the NBA]].

WRC-TV presently broadcasts 45 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 35 minutes each weekday; three hours on Saturdays and five hours on Sundays). By 2001, WRC's newscasts had all been rated number one in the market, with some of the success attributed to [[Jim Vance]] and [[Doreen Gentzler]], who anchored together from 1989 until Vance's death in 2017. Vance had been with Channel 4 since 1969, and was promoted to anchor three years later.<ref name="schudel">Schudel, Matt.

It still leads most time slots today, although WTTG's morning news and WJLA's 11:00 pm news have given it much competition in the 25–54 demo.

In 1974, WRC-TV adopted the ''NewsCenter'' branding, following the three other NBC-owned stations at the time in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago in adopting the ''NewsCenter'' branding.

In 1975, the station adopted [[MFSB]]'s song "My Mood" as the closing theme music for the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast every Friday, which remains in use by the station today.<ref>[https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/07/23/arch-campbell-remembers-his-friend-jim-vance/ Arch Campbell Remembers His Friend Jim Vance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723165829/https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/07/23/arch-campbell-remembers-his-friend-jim-vance/ |date=July 23, 2017 }}, ''The Washingtonian'', June 23, 2017, Retrieved July 26, 2017.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYgs069D7rY&t=27m39s WRC-TV: News 4 at 11pm Saturday – 07/22/17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180601144930/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYgs069D7rY&t=27m39s |date=June 1, 2018 }} YouTube clip, Retrieved July 23, 2017.</ref>  Michael Randall commissioned the news theme for WRC-TV entitled "NewsCenter Theme", which was used by the station until 1986; also, [[Charlie Rose]] was hired by WRC-TV after his short stint at [[KXAS-TV]] in [[Dallas]] and hosted the ''Charlie Rose Show'' from its premiere in 1980 until he left the station in 1984 for [[CBS News]]. The station also hired [[George Michael (sportscaster)|George Michael]] as their sports anchor, eventually launching the nationally syndicated program ''[[The George Michael Sports Machine]]'', which originated from the studios of WRC-TV from its entire run from 1984 until 2007 (''The George Michael Sports Machine'' was distributed by the station's sister company [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]]).

In 1982, after 8 years of using the ''NewsCenter'' branding, the news branding was changed to ''Channel 4 News''. The station added a 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast in 1984. In 1989, the news branding was changed again to its current name of ''News 4''. Coinciding with the name change, the station used a new promotional campaign "We Work Well Together", produced by Music Oasis, which was also adopted as its news theme until 1992. In 1991, WRC-TV added a morning newscast under the title of ''News 4 Today'', becoming the first morning newscast in Washington, D.C. From January 14 to October 25, 1991, the station also produced a 7:30&nbsp;p.m. newscast for then-[[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] WFTY (now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WDCW]]) entitled ''7:30 News Headlines''. The newscast suffered low ratings during its run.

In 1993, the station adopted the news music theme entitled "Working 4 You", which also serves as a current station slogan for News 4. [[615 Music]] remixed the theme in 1997, this time under the title of "Working For You". The theme was also used by other NBC affiliated stations (including [[WHO-TV]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Iowa]], [[KPLC-TV]] in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]], [[Louisiana]], [[WPSD]] in [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]], [[Kentucky]] and [[WEAU-TV]] in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], [[Wisconsin]]). In 2002, WRC-TV adopted "The Tower" news theme commissioned by 615 Music from Chicago sister station WMAQ-TV with the notes of the "Working For You" theme as a musical trademark added only in the news opens. The "Working For You" theme continued to be used as a closing theme for all of its newscasts. Both "Working For You" and "The Tower V.1 with Working For You" were both in use by the station until 2008, when they switched to [[Gari Media Group]]'s "The NBC Collection" now with added notes of the "Working For You" theme.

On January 14, 2009, WRC-TV and WTTG entered into a [[Local News Service]] (called LNS) agreement in which the two stations pool video and share news helicopter footage. The agreement is similar to ones already made between Fox and NBC owned-and-operated stations in Chicago (WMAQ-TV and [[WFLD]]) and [[Philadelphia]] ([[WCAU]] and [[WTXF]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/162178-Fox_And_NBC_To_Share_In_DC.php|title=Fox And NBC To Share In DC|accessdate=January 14, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925034243/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/162178-Fox_And_NBC_To_Share_In_DC.php|archivedate=September 25, 2012}}</ref> WUSA later joined that agreement. In 2012, News Director Camille Edwards announced the station would no longer participate in LNS, but the stations would continue to share the helicopter. In 2016, the station launched its own helicopter, Chopper4.

On April 8, 2010, the station began test broadcasts of its news programming in high definition during local news updates seen during ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]''; regular newscasts continued to be broadcast in standard definition. WRC-TV started broadcasting its newscasts from a temporary set on February 8, 2010 while "upgrades" were being made on its main set and the station made final adjustments for its switch to high definition. On April 22, 2010, WRC became the fourth (and final) [[American English|English-language]] television station in the Washington, D.C. [[media market|market]] to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. It is the only station in the Washington market that shoots most of its remote field video in [[16:9]] [[widescreen]]; other stations still shoot live field video in [[4:3]] and then either [[pillarbox]] or stretch this content to widescreen—though WRC's field video is shot in standard definition.

On September 15, 2014, the station's newscasts shifted to a full 16:9 widescreen presentation, therefore becoming the third English-language television station in the Washington, D.C. market to do so, following Tegna-owned CBS affiliate WUSA (January 2013) and Fox O&O WTTG (August 2013).  In conjunction with this, the newscast title was changed to a variation of the station's NBC 4 logo and also, its longtime newscast theme music was heavily updated.  Also, the station's "Look F" graphics package from NBC ArtWorks, which was introduced 2 years earlier (May 2012), was reformatted for the 16:9 presentation.

On June 29, 2016, the station officially began using the "Look N" graphics package that was first adopted by sister station WNBC (which began using the package on June 11), becoming the sixth NBC-owned station to use this package, following [[WVIT]] (June 13), [[WTVJ]] (also on June 13), KXAS-TV (June 20) and WMAQ-TV (testing on June 21; full usage beginning June 28).

On July 31, 2017, WRC-TV became the first station in Washington, D.C. to expand its morning newscasts to 4:00&nbsp;a.m. In May 2018, after 10 years of using "The NBC Collection with Working for You" news theme, the station brought back 615 Music's "The Tower" news theme, this time without the famous "Working for You" musical trademark; the news theme was previously used with the "Working for You" signature only in the news opens from 2002 until 2008{{clarify|date=May 2020}}; the theme has also been used by sister station WVIT since 2016.
