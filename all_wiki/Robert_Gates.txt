Gates left the CIA in 1974 to serve on the staff of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. He returned to the CIA in late 1979, serving briefly as the director of the Strategic Evaluation Center, Office of Strategic Research. He was named the Director of the DCI/DDCI Executive Staff in 1981, Deputy Director for Intelligence in 1982, and [[CIA Deputy Director|Deputy Director of Central Intelligence]] from April 18, 1986, to March 20, 1989.

===Director of Central Intelligence===
[[File:Robert Gates CIA photo.jpg|thumb|left|Gates while [[Director of Central Intelligence]]]]

Gates was Deputy [[Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs]] from March until August 1989, and was Assistant to the President and [[Deputy National Security Adviser]] from August 1989 until November 1991.

Gates was nominated to become the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (head of the CIA) in early 1987. He withdrew his name after it became clear the Senate would reject the nomination due to controversy about his role in the [[Iran-Contra Affair|Iran-Contra affair]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1987/03/02/gates-to-withdraw-as-cia-nominee/f84b9c42-4531-4fca-85bc-f6e2b13bb9e3/|title=Gates to Withdraw as CIA Nominee|date=1987-03-02|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

Gates was nominated, for the second time, for the position of Director of Central Intelligence by President George H. W. Bush on May 14, 1991, confirmed by the Senate on November 5, and sworn in on November 6.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/17/us/robert-gates-fast-facts/index.html|title=Robert Gates Fast Facts |work= CNN.com |access-date= 2018-09-04}}</ref>

During a Senate committee hearing on his nomination, former division chief [[Melvin Goodman]] testified that the agency was the most corrupt and slanted during the tenure of [[William Casey]] with Gates serving as Deputy. According to Goodman, Gates was part of an agency leadership that proliferated false information and ignored 'reality'. [[National Intelligence Council]] chairman Harold P. Ford testified that during his tenure, Gates had transgressed [[professional boundaries]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/02/news/02iht-cia_.html "Ex-Aide Calls CIA Under Casey and Gates Corrupt and Slanted"], Paul Horvitz. New York Times. October 2, 1991. Accessed June 8, 2011</ref>

Deputy Directors during his tenure were [[Richard J. Kerr]] (from November 6, 1991 until March 2, 1992) and Adm. [[William O. Studeman]] (from April 9, 1992, through the remainder of Gates' tenure). He served until 1993.

===Level of involvement in the Iran–Contra scandal===
Because of his senior status in the CIA, Gates was close to many figures who played significant roles in the [[Iran-Contra Affair|Iran–Contra Affair]] and was in a position to have known of their activities. In 1984, as deputy director of CIA, Gates advocated that the U.S. initiate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua and that the U.S. do everything in its power short of direct military invasion of the country to remove the [[Sandinista]] government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/1125-04.htm|title=''Los Angeles Times'', November 25, 2006, free archived version at commondreams.org, lase visited November 26, 2006|url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070622162909/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/1125-04.htm|archive-date=June 22, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Gates was an early subject of Independent Counsel's investigation, but the investigation of Gates intensified in the spring of 1991 as part of a larger inquiry into the Iran–Contra activities of CIA officials. This investigation received an additional impetus in May 1991, when President George H. W. Bush nominated Gates to be [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI). The chairman and vice chairman of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] (SSCI) requested, in a letter to the Independent Counsel on May 15, 1991, any information that would "significantly bear on the fitness" of Gates for the CIA post.

Gates consistently testified that he first heard on October 1, 1986, from [[Charles E. Allen]], the national intelligence officer who was closest to the Iran initiative, that proceeds from the Iran arms sales may have been diverted to support the [[Contras]]. Other evidence proves, however, that Gates received a report on the diversion during the summer of 1986 from DDI Richard Kerr.<ref>{{cite web| website= GlobalSecurity.org| url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/reports/1993/walsh/chap_16.htm |title= Iran-Contra Report| publisher= Chapter 16}}</ref> The issue was whether the Independent Counsel could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gates was deliberately not telling the truth when he later claimed not to have remembered any reference to the diversion before meeting with Allen in October.
[[File:President Bush meets with General Colin Powell, General Scowcroft, Secretary James Baker, Vice President Quayle... - NARA - 186429.tif|thumb|President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] meets with Robert Gates, General [[Colin Powell]], Secretary [[Dick Cheney]] and others about the situation in the Persian Gulf and Operation [[Desert Shield]], January 15, 1991]]

[[Grand jury]] secrecy rules hampered Independent Counsel's response. Nevertheless, in order to answer questions about Gates' prior testimony, Independent Counsel accelerated his investigation of Gates in the summer of 1991. This investigation was substantially completed by September 3, 1991, at which time Independent Counsel determined that Gates' Iran–Contra activities and testimony did not warrant prosecution.

Independent Counsel made this decision subject to developments that could have warranted reopening his inquiry, including testimony by [[Clair George|Clair E. George]], the CIA's former deputy director for operations. At the time Independent Counsel reached this decision, the possibility remained that George could have provided information warranting reconsideration of Gates' status in the investigation. George refused to cooperate with Independent Counsel and was indicted on September 19, 1991. George subpoenaed Gates to testify as a defense witness at George's first trial in the summer of 1994, but Gates was never called.

The final report of the Independent Counsel for [[Iran-Contra Scandal|Iran–Contra Scandal]], issued on August 4, 1993, said that Gates "was close to many figures who played significant roles in the Iran/contra affair and was in a position to have known of their activities. The evidence developed by Independent Counsel did not warrant indictment ..."<ref>{{cite web| first= Lawrence E. |last= Walsh| url= https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/ |title= Final report of the independent counsel for Iran/Contra matters|date= August 4, 1993}};  in particular, [https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/chap_16.htm Chapter 16, "Robert M. Gates"]</ref>

==Career after leaving the CIA==
===1993–1999===
After retiring from the CIA in 1993, Gates worked as an academic and lecturer. He evaluated student theses for the [[international relations|International Studies]] Program of the [[University of Washington]]. He lectured at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana]], [[Louisiana State University|Louisiana State]], [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], and the [[College of William and Mary]]. Gates served as a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Oklahoma International Programs Center and a trustee of the endowment fund for the College of William and Mary, his [[alma mater]], which in 1998 conferred upon him [[honorary degree]] of [[Doctor of Humane Letters]].<ref name="Honorary degree recipients -- Special Collections Research Center Wiki">{{cite web|url=http://scdb.swem.wm.edu/wiki/index.php/Honorary_degrees |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130306042907/http://scdb.swem.wm.edu/wiki/index.php/Honorary_degrees|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 6, 2013|title=Honorary degree recipients|work=wm.edu|access-date=April 23, 2014}}</ref> In 1996, Gates' [[autobiography]], ''From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War'', was published.

Gates is a former president of the [[National Eagle Scout Association]].<ref name="NESA">{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/ScoutingIntheNews/030802.aspx|title=NESA Mourns Loss of Eagles in Operation Iraqi Freedom|year=2008|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|access-date=July 7, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828072641/http://www.scouting.org/Media/ScoutingIntheNews/030802.aspx|archive-date=August 28, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In January 2004, Gates co-chaired a [[Council on Foreign Relations]] task force on U.S. relations towards Iran. Among the task force's primary recommendation was to directly engage Iran on a diplomatic level regarding Iranian nuclear technology. Key points included a negotiated position that would allow Iran to develop its nuclear program in exchange for a commitment from Iran to use the program only for peaceful means.<ref>[http://www.cfr.org/publication/7194/iran.html ''Iran: Time for a New Approach''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203072555/http://www.cfr.org/publication/7194/iran.html |date=December 3, 2006 }}, final report of an independent task force, July 2004, Council of Foreign Relations Press</ref>

At the time of his nomination by President George W. Bush to the position of Secretary of Defense, Gates was also a member of the [[Iraq Study Group]], also called the Baker Commission, which was expected to issue its report in November 2006, following the mid-term election on November 7. He was replaced by former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Lawrence Eagleburger]].

===Declined appointment as Director of National Intelligence===
In February 2005, Gates wrote in a message posted on his school's website that "there seems to be a growing number of rumors in the media and around campus that I am leaving Texas A&M to become the new [[director of national intelligence]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]" The message said that "To put the rumors to rest, I was indeed asked to take the position, wrestled with perhaps the most difficult—and close—decision of my life, and last week declined the position."<ref name=KBTX>{{cite web|title=Gates Turns Down Bush Administration Position |url=http://www.kbtx.com/news/headlines/1217482.html|publisher=KBTX.com|access-date=July 14, 2012 |date=February 1, 2005|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118011453/http://www.kbtx.com/news/headlines/1217482.html|archive-date=January 18, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Gates committed to remain as President of Texas A&M University and President [[George W. Bush]] offered the position of [[United States Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI) to [[John Negroponte]], who accepted.<ref>{{cite news

Gates said in a 2005 discussion with the university's Academy for Future International Leaders that he had tentatively decided to accept the DNI position out of a sense of duty and had written an email that would be sent to students during the press conference to announce his decision, explaining that he was leaving to serve the U.S. once again. Gates, however, took the weekend to consider what his final decision should be, and ultimately decided that he was unwilling to return to Washington, D.C., in any capacity, simply because he "had nothing to look forward to in D.C. and plenty to look forward to at A&M".<ref name="CBS1">{{cite news|last=Esterbrook|first=John|title=A Closer Look At Robert Gates|publisher=CBS News|date=November 8, 2006 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/08/terror/main2163357.shtml|access-date=February 3, 2009}}</ref>

On November 8, 2006, after the [[2006 United States general elections|2006 midterm election]], President [[George W.

Gates was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] [[Senate Armed Services Committee|Armed Services Committee]] on December 5, 2006.

====Walter Reed Medical Center scandal====
Several months after his appointment, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a series of articles beginning February 18, 2007 that brought to the spotlight the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal]].<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2007/02/21/LI2007022100671.html| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080107185011/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2007/02/21/LI2007022100671.html |archive-date= 2008-01-07| url-status= dead | work= Washington Post| date= 2007-02-21| title= [Unknown title]| access-date= September 4, 2019}}</ref> As a result of the fallout from the incident, Gates announced the removal of [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] [[Francis J.

====Controversy over Joint Chiefs====
On June 8, 2007, Gates announced that he would not recommend the renomination of [[Peter Pace]], the [[Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff]], due to anticipated difficulties with the confirmation process. Instead, Gates recommended [[Mike Mullen]], the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] at the time, to fill the position. Gates stated: "I am no stranger to contentious confirmations, and I do not shrink from them. However, I have decided that at this moment in our history, the nation, our men and women in uniform, and General Pace himself would not be well-served by a divisive ordeal in selecting the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff." Gates referred to Pace as a friend and praised his service as a Marine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=3984|title=DoD News Briefing with Secretary Robert Gates from the Pentagon|date=8 June 2007|website=U.S. Department of Defense|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714081418/http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=3984|archive-date=July 14, 2015}}</ref>

In a March 2010 speech to a NATO conference in Washington, Secretary Gates said that "The demilitarization of Europe—where large swaths of the general public and political class are averse to military force and the risks that go with it—has gone from a blessing in the 20th century to an impediment to achieving real security and lasting peace in the 21st".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/world/europe/04iht-letter.html|title=Shaping Policy by Playing Safe| first= Judy| last= Dempsey|date=March 3, 2010|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

====Fiscal restraint====
Gates' tenure with the Obama administration included a huge shift in military spending.  In April 2009, Gates proposed a large shift in budget priorities in the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 budget.

It was announced in August 2010 that Gates was trying to find $100 billion in Defense savings through to 2015, in order to instill a "culture of savings and restraint" in the military. Secretary Gates said that "It is important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, where tough economic times or the winding down of a military campaign leads to steep and unwise reductions in defense". Gates said "As a matter of principle and political reality, the Department of Defense cannot expect America's elected representatives to approve budget increases each year unless we are doing a good job, indeed everything possible, to make every dollar count".<ref name="the Hill">{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/113393-gates-announces-major-job-cuts-as-pentagon-tightens-belt|title=Gates announces major job cuts as Pentagon looks to cut spending|work=TheHill}}</ref>  These cuts included the closing of the [[United States Joint Forces Command|Joint Forces Command]], the redundancy of fifty general and admirals, and the removal of 150 senior civilian positions.

====NATO comments====
On January 16, 2008 Gates was quoted in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as saying NATO forces in southern Afghanistan do not know how to properly combat a guerrilla insurgency and that could be contributing to rising violence in the country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-usafghan16jan16,1,163569.story?coll=la-headlines-world|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Gates says NATO force unable to fight guerrillas|first=Peter|last=Spiegel|date=January 16, 2008|access-date=May 22, 2010|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206233513/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-usafghan16jan16,1,163569.story?coll=la-headlines-world |archive-date=February 6, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Netherlands<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-gates17jan17,1,6875867.story?coll=la-headlines-world|work=Los Angeles Times|title=U.S. envoy quizzed on Gates' remarks|date=January 17, 2008|access-date=May 22, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and United Kingdom<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3201002.ece |work=The Times|location=London|title=Outrage as US accuses Britain of inexperience in Taleban conflict |date=January 17, 2008|access-date=March 27, 2010|first=Michael|last=Evans}}</ref> protested.

In a June 10, 2011 speech in Brussels,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1581|title=Speech View|work=defense.gov}}</ref> before NATO, Gates again stated that other NATO members must do more as the United States tackles its budget deficit. He said bluntly that<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/world/europe/11gates.html|work=The New York Times |location=U.S.|title=Defense Secretary Warns NATO of 'Dim' Future|date=June 10, 2011 |access-date=June 10, 2011|first=Thom|last=Shanker}}</ref>

<blockquote>In the past, I've worried openly about NATO turning into a two-tiered alliance: Between members who specialize in "soft" humanitarian, development, peacekeeping and talking tasks, and those conducting the "hard" combat missions.  Between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership—be they security guarantees or headquarters billets—but don't want to share the risks and the costs.  This is no longer a hypothetical worry.  We are there today.  And it is unacceptable. The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress—and in the American body politic writ large—to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense. Nations apparently willing and eager for American taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in European defense budgets. Indeed, if current trends in the decline of European defense capabilities are not halted and reversed, future U.S. political leaders—those for whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for me—may not consider the return on America's investment in NATO worth the cost.</blockquote>

==Criticism==
[[File:Robert-Gates Armed-Services-Committee.JPEG|thumb|right|Gates responds to a question during the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] hearing on December 5, 2006]]
As deputy director and director of America's leading intelligence agency for many years, Gates and his CIA staff have been faulted for failing to accurately gauge the decline and disintegration of the Soviet Union. More particularly, Gates has been criticized for allegedly concocting evidence to show that the Soviet Union was stronger than it actually was.<ref name="Newsweek">{{cite news |title=Old Names, Old Scandals|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15627855/site/newsweek |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=November 8, 2006|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118090120/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15627855/site/newsweek/ |archive-date=November 18, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[George P.
