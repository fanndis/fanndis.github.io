[[File:Peachtree-Pine shelter.jpg|thumb| The [[Peachtree-Pine shelter]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]]]
'''Homeless shelters''' are a type of homeless service agency which provide temporary residence for [[homelessness|homeless]] individuals and families. Shelters exist to provide residents with safety and protection from exposure to the weather while simultaneously reducing the [[environmental impact]] on the community. They are similar to, but distinguishable from, various types of [[emergency shelter]]s, which are typically operated for specific circumstances and populations—fleeing natural disasters or abusive social circumstances. Extreme weather conditions create problems similar to [[disaster management]] scenarios, and are handled with [[warming center]]s, which typically operate for short durations during adverse weather.

===Health issues===
Hundreds of homeless individuals die each year from diseases, untreated medical conditions, lack of nutrition, starvation, and exposure to extreme cold or hot weather. In a mild-wintered San Francisco in 1998, homeless people were purportedly 58% more likely to perish than the general population. In [[New Orleans]], approximately 10,000 homeless were unaccounted for after [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bwh&AN=18673816&site=ehost-live|title = N.O.

In [[Washington, D.C.]], statistics indicate that 63% of homeless people suffer from a lack of access to regular bathing. Another estimated 58% within the same city are unable to obtain sufficient levels of sleep. Areas such as showers and bathrooms in shelters often have restricted access with limited hours.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/15/more-pads-for-homeless-women-help.html|title = More Pads for Homeless Women On Their Periods|last = De Bode|first = Lisa|date = 15 April 2015|work = Aljazeera America|access-date = 22 July 2015}}</ref> Homeless individuals also have great trouble finding storage locations for their belongings.

=== LGBT community ===
The [[LGBT]] homeless are at increased risk of violence compared to other groups.<ref name=":6" /> [[Transgender]] people are also at danger of being placed into the incorrect shelters. In some cases, transgender women can be turned away from women's shelters.<ref name=":19">{{Cite news|url = http://www.13abc.com/home/headlines/Transgender-woman-upset-after-being-kicked-out-of-shelter-309397841.html|title = Transgender Woman Upset After Being Kicked Out of Shelter|date = 25 June 2015|work = 13 ABC|access-date = 17 December 2015}}</ref> This can place their safety at risk.<ref name=":19" />

=== Men ===
In a national survey conducted in the United States the findings showed that of the surveyed homeless, two-thirds are men and most likely to be single adults between the ages of 25 and 54.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://www.nhchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/June2001HealingHands.pdf|title = Single Males: The Homeless Majority|date = June 2001|journal = Healing Hands|access-date = 17 December 2015|page = 1|volume = 5|issue = 3}}</ref>

=== Women ===
Women are at great risk of both homelessness and poverty because they are most likely to bear child-rearing responsibilities and vulnerable to become victims of family members or “intimate partners.”<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pbh&AN=48169023&site=ehost-live|title = 'Like a Prison!': Homeless Women's Narratives of Surviving Shelter|last1 = Deward|first1 = Sarah L.|date = March 2010|journal = Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare|access-date = 22 July 2015|last2 = Moe|first2 = Angela M.|issue = 1|volume = 37|pages = 115–135}}</ref> In a survey conducted in 2013 showed that in an emergency shelter in [[Texas]], women were the majority population, though this is not a trend reflected in the majority of the country.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.news-journal.com/news/2013/feb/05/survey-more-women-than-men-in-area-homeless-shelte/|title = Survey: More Women Than Men in Area Homeless Shelters|last = Ward|first = Angela|date = 5 February 2013|work = Longview News-Journal|access-date = 17 December 2015}}</ref>

== Alternative models and management philosophies ==

=== Housing first practice===
The homeless shelters across the country act merely as emergency shelter systems that can only hold a fraction of the rapidly increasing homeless population. The Housing First practice provides an alternative to the current network of homeless shelters. The program targets the large problem within the United States which is a lack of affordable housing.  This methodology attempts to place homeless families back into independent living situations as quickly as possible. The Housing First practice has achieved success because homeless families are more responsive to social services support once when they are in their own housing. It provides crisis intervention, affordable rental housing, and gives each family a grace period of six months to a year of social service to allow the family to get back on their feet.  The effectiveness of this concept is that it assists homeless families in identifying their needs and recognizing the choices they must make. From this point families can create better options for themselves and plan strategies for living on their own.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beyondshelter.org/aaa_initiatives/ending_homelessness.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202191234/http://www.beyondshelter.org/aaa_initiatives/ending_homelessness.shtml |archive-date=2011-12-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Empowerment model===
Some shelters propose “empowerment models,” where instead of serving “clients," they empower “participants.” The goal is to become agents in their own futures and destinies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Such models tend to focus on assisting participants to access their rights and to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens. Sometimes this includes contributing financially towards the provision of the shelters they are residing in. In Australia, legislation requires those residing in Government funded shelters to contribute a figure similar to 25% of their own income, in return for support and accommodation. Consequently, many shelters in Australia rely on participant contributions for as much as 20% of their budgets.<ref>Najidah Association Inc. Annual report, 2007.</ref>

===Religious shelters===
Another model is Dorothy's Place in Salinas, CA. It is actually a day center which coordinates with multiple church and synagogue congregations to link up to night time shelter opportunities. Dorothy's Place is closely affiliated with faith based community service groups, including the Franciscan Worker and Companions of the Way Interfaith Dharma community. They propose that they are in search of “possibilitarians,” a theme resonating with the prominent ministry of “possibility thinking” promoted by [[Reformed Church of America]] minister [[Robert H. Schuller|Robert Schuller]].

The Rescue Mission in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] is an extreme example of helping the homeless through religion. In order to receive a free meal at the Rescue Mission, residents must first attend a [[Christianity|Christian]] prayer service.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.milwaukeemag.com/2015/07/13/food-for-the-soul-homeless-milwaukee/|title = Food for the Soul|last = Hrodey|first = Matt|date = 13 July 2015|work = Milwaukee Magazine|access-date = 23 July 2015}}</ref>

Union Rescue Mission in [[Los Angeles| California]] is One of the nation's largest provider of continuous emergency shelter services, URM provides comprehensive care for men, women, and children who are experiencing homelessness. A person's first point of contact with URM is with their Emergency (Guest) Services, where guests immediate physical needs are met. Their day rooms provide shelter and rest from the streets. Guests can sign up for beds, eat three meals a day, take showers and get haircuts, pick out fresh clothes, and receive medical care. Counseling from our staff is also available to guests, regarding options to join our recovery programs or to utilize other service providers in the area. They serve an average of 3,000 warm, nutritious meals each day — three times a day, every day of the year. To help meet the special needs of children, they provide infant formula and baby food, as well sack lunches to take to school. Shelter – Each night, hundreds of men, women, and children find a warm bed and safety from the dangerous streets. We house an average of 924 men, women, and children each night, including about over 80 families.

The [[Salvation Army]] is a social support service organization that also functions as a religious group.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=f5h&AN=45223892&site=ehost-live|title = Help for the Helpers|last = Young|first = Ben|date = November 2009|journal = Georgia Trend|access-date = 24 July 2015|volume = 25|issue = 3|page = 18}}</ref> The programs of the Salvation Army are designed to assist women, children, elderly men, families, and those who are battling drug addictions.

=== Vehicles as shelter ===
Around the late 2000s, in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and other areas in [[California]], groups of recently homeless began to camp out in their cars in [[parking lot]]s with the coordinated support of a local non-profit group.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title = Homelessness|last = Fleck|first = Carole|publisher = Greenhaven Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780737759396|location = Farmington Hills, Michigan|pages = [https://archive.org/details/homelessness0000thom/page/31 31–32]|chapter = Is Homelessness a Serious Problem?|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/homelessness0000thom/page/31}}</ref> These individuals and families were often unable to afford rent or [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]], but still had jobs, cars, insurance and other types of support structures.<ref name=":7" /> In Santa Barbara, an estimated 55 individuals camped out every night in various private and public lots, some reserved for women only.<ref name=":7" /> As more people began to camp in their vehicles, California cities began to  pass laws against sleeping in vehicles, like the 2013 ordinance passed in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].<ref name=":8">{{Cite news|url = http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2014/11/18/palo-alto-strikes-down-car-camping-ban|title = Palo Alto Strikes Down Car-Camping Ban|last = Sheyner|first = Gennady|date = 18 November 2014|work = Palo Alto Online|access-date = 23 July 2015}}</ref> However, many of these laws in different municipalities were later struck down in higher courts as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]],<ref name=":8" /> like the [[Los Angeles]] ban which was judged by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 2014.<ref name=":9">{{Cite news|url = http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/07/23/53164/homeless-living-in-cars-baffle-neighborhoods/|title = Number of Homeless Living in Cars, RVs in LA Grows|last = Tam|first = Susanica|date = 23 July 2015|work = Southern California Public Radio|access-date = 23 July 2015}}</ref> Some cities chose to repeal their own bans on sleeping in vehicles.<ref name=":8" /> In Los Angeles in 2015, approximately 9,500 homeless have turned their cars into homes.<ref name=":9" /> In [[Hawaii]], a [[Honolulu]]-based company is retrofitting five retired city [[bus]]es into mobile shelters which provide a place to sleep and get a shower.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/12/hawaii-mobile-homeless-shelters_n_7571924.html|title = Hawaii to Convert Retired Buses Into Fleet of Mobil Homeless Shelters, Showers|last = Goldberg|first = Eleanor|date = 12 June 2015|work = The Huffington Post|access-date = 24 July 2015}}</ref>

== Community attitudes ==
Community attitude towards homeless shelters varies widely, but one study found that older people, men, homeowners and all people making larger incomes were often averse to the concept of homeless shelters in general.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Putting Health Into Place|last = Takahashi|first = Lois M.|publisher = Syracuse University Press|year = 1998|isbn = 0815627688|location = Syracuse, New York|pages = 153–157|chapter = Concepts of Difference in Community Health|editor-last = Kearns|editor-first = Robin A.|editor-last2 = Gesler|editor-first2 = Wilbert M.}}</ref>  [[Calgary]] neighborhoods recognize the need for shelters, but many don't want to situate a shelter near their own homes.<ref name=":1" /> A similar response came from residents in [[Oahu]].<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/29524570/state-homeless-shelters-controversial-now-and-20-years-ago|title = State Homeless Shelters Controversial Now and 20 Years Ago|last = Kerr|first = Keoki|date = 10 July 2015|work = Hawaii News Now|access-date = 22 July 2015}}</ref> In communities such as Portland, Oregon, where the weather can be quite harsh, there is an extensive network of supporters. These operate an informal restaurant, the "Sisters of the Road" cafe, which supports both homeless shelter residents and also some unsheltered persons. At the opposite end of the spectrum, jurisdictions such as [[Santa Barbara, California]], feature ongoing disputes in an often highly adversarial mode.<ref>Santa Barbara Independent, January 2011</ref> Disputes have even reached such schemes as re-arranging benches on city sidewalks to discourage panhandlers. In another 2011 incident, an eight unit [[supportive housing]] project which had been approved was called back onto city council agenda the following week in order to allow approximately 35 public comments pro and con, despite the fact that the measure had just been approved.

There have at times been concerns raised about the transmission of diseases in the homeless population housed in shelters, although public health professionals contend that such concerns are inflated.<ref>Najidah Association Inc. Annual return to the Dept. of Communities 2006</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=13923&p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER |title=Occupational Exposure to Tuberculosis |publisher= [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] notice |year=1997 }}</ref> In addition, a study published in 2014 conducted in [[Marseille|Marseille, France]] found that respiratory illnesses in homeless shelters were not significantly different from the general population.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|title = Respiratory viruses within homeless shelters in Marseille, France|last1 = Thiberville|first1 = Simon-djamel|date = 5 February 2014|journal = BMC Research Notes|doi = 10.1186/1756-0500-7-81|pmid = 24499605|volume = 7|issue = 81|last2 = Salez|first2 = Nicolas|last3 = Benkouiten|last4 = Badiaga|first3 = Samir|first4 = Sekene|last5 = Charrel|first5 = Remi|last6 = Brouqui|first6 = Philippe|page = 81|pmc = 3918144}}</ref> In addition, during the peak [[influenza]] months, the shelter occupants did not test positive for the flu virus and the researchers hypothesize that being isolated from others may have been the reason they were virus-free.<ref name=":10" /> However, outbreaks of [[tuberculosis]] in have been reported occurring in shelters within three large [[Ohio]] cities in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Epidemic of Health Care Worker Injury: An Epidemiology|publisher = CRC Press|year = 1999|isbn = 0849333822|pages = 78|editor-first = William|editor-last = Charney|editor-last2 = Fragala|editor-first2 = Guy|chapter = Occupational Exposure to Tuberculosis}}</ref>

A question has been raised as just how much money donated to the charities that run the shelters actually gets to the homeless people and the required services. In many cases, there is a large overhead in administrative costs, which compromise the money for their homeless clients.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.bostonnow.com/news/local/2007/08/13/the-high-price-of-giving|title = The High Price of Giving|last = O'Brien|first = James|date = 13 August 2007|work = Boston Now|access-date = 23 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071111183241/http://www.bostonnow.com/news/local/2007/08/13/the-high-price-of-giving|archive-date = 11 November 2007}}</ref>

=== Internal problems in homeless shelters ===
There is sometimes corruption and theft by the employees of a shelter as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by [[WFXT|FOX 25 TV]] in [[Boston]] wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food over a period of time from the shelter's kitchen for their private use and catering.<ref>Beaudet, Mike, [http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/undercover/money-food-taken-from-city-kitchen-20110222 "FOX Undercover: Employees implicated in thefts from local homeless"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303140612/http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/undercover/money-food-taken-from-city-kitchen-20110222 |date=2011-03-03 }}, FOX 25 TV, Boston, Tuesday, 22 Feb 2011</ref><ref>Smith, Stephen, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/02/23/shelter_kitchen_theft_prevalent_report_says/ "Shelter kitchen theft prevalent, report says"], ''The Boston Globe'', February 23, 2011</ref> Residents have reported that personal items, such as underwear, were stolen by other residents while they were occupied.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Shelter: Where Harvard Meets the Homeless|url = https://archive.org/details/shelterwhereharv00seid|url-access = limited|last = Seider|first = Scott|publisher = The Continuum International Publishing Group|year = 2010|isbn = 9781441137371|location = New York|pages = [https://archive.org/details/shelterwhereharv00seid/page/n41 33]–34}}</ref>

Shelters can become dangerously overcrowded when too many occupants are allowed entry to the shelter.<ref name=":11">{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/nyregion/sylvias-place-faces-licensing-problems.html?_r=0|title = A Church.

Shelters sometimes are unable to meet state standards for occupancy, such as testing fire sprinklers or ensuring that exits are clearly marked.<ref name=":11" /> In New York city, 2015, the state withheld funding from many shelters which did not meet standards or which had poor conditions.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-withholds-funds-from-some-new-york-city-homeless-shelters-1431482602|title = State Withholds Funds From Some New York City Homeless Shelters|last = Dawsey|first = Josh|date = 12 May 2015|work = The Wall Street Journal|access-date = 24 July 2015}}</ref>

=== External problems ===
Several problems emerge when a homeless shelter is present. Homeless shelters have been argued by some to have a negative effect on nearby businesses.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=f5h&AN=95939242&site=ehost-live|title = Investing in the Homeless Corridor|last = Nishimura|first = Scott|date = 28 April 2014|journal = Fort Worth Business Press|access-date = 22 July 2015|url-access=subscription |volume = 26|issue = 16|pages = 1, 23–25}}</ref> Businesses for years have complained that they frequently witness pedestrians being stopped outside their stores by homeless people begging for money. Such instances have led to the creation of local laws that prohibit “aggressive panhandling.” Another problem is that it is often difficult to decide on where a homeless shelter should be built and how to zone the area where a shelter can be built.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.kimatv.com/home/video/City-of-Yakima-struggles-to-find-a-solution-for-homeless-shelter-zoning-318085811.html|title = City of Yakima Struggles to Find a Solution for Homeless Shelter Zoning|last = Ramos|first = Claudia|date = 21 July 2015|work = KIMA TV|access-date = 22 July 2015|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723095630/http://www.kimatv.com/home/video/City-of-Yakima-struggles-to-find-a-solution-for-homeless-shelter-zoning-318085811.html|archive-date = 23 July 2015}}</ref>

Neighborhoods, as well as schools, argue that homeless shelters bring in bad elements to their surroundings. There are additionally far too many shelters that have become nothing but housing facilities; they fail to provide job training or education that would assist the homeless population with gaining their own housing. Housing through homeless shelters offers no lasting solutions, just temporary ones. Drugs and alcohol also tend to surround homeless shelters. Most shelters prohibit residential use of illegal drugs and alcohol, but enforcement is sporadic in many locations. Lastly, no classification system for shelters has been put into effect. There are no mechanisms or facilities to separate those who have mental illnesses from the rest of the shelter population.<ref>Skolnick, Jerome H., and Elliott Currie.

Homeless shelters need to provide a variety of services to diverse residents. Homeless shelters, like La Posada Providencia in [[San Benito, Texas]], may also house [[Refugee|asylum seekers]], mainly from [[Mexico]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=100169989&site=ehost-live|title = Seeking Refuge|last = Rose|first = Ananda|date = 9 January 2015|journal = Commonweal|access-date = 22 July 2015|volume = 142|issue = 1|pages = 10–12|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Shelters also provide [[outreach]] to residents who are unable to use a shelter or who choose not to use a shelter.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://wishtv.com/2015/01/07/team-effort-to-help-indys-homeless-survive-the-cold/|title = Team Effort to Help Indy's Homeless Survive the Cold|last = Grove|first = Dustin|date = 7 January 2015|work = Wish TV|access-date = 22 July 2015}}</ref> Outreach may include providing clothing for cold weather or food. Very few shelters have case managers that locate resources locally, such as rides to a department of social services where [[Medicaid|healthcare]] can be acquired.

Most shelters typically expect residents to exit in the morning and occupy themselves elsewhere during the day, returning for an evening meal and to sleep. During times of inclement weather, shelters may provide services outside of their normal hours.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nbcneb.com/home/headlines/Homeless-Battle-Heat-Through-Help-From-Homeless-Shelters-315123761.html|title = Homeless Battle Heat Through Help From Homeless Shelters|last = Champ|first = Anastasia|date = 15 July 2015|work = NBC Nebraska|access-date = 22 July 2015}}</ref> [[Curfew]]s vary widely but tend to be at an earlier hour than adults typically might return to a home. There are also daytime-only homeless shelters, where the homeless can go when they cannot stay inside at their night time sleeping shelter during the day. Such an early model of a daytime homeless shelter providing multi-faceted services is [[Saint Francis House (Boston)|Saint Francis House]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] which was officially founded in 1984. It was based on the [[Settlement movement|settlement house]], [[Clubhouse Model of Psychosocial Rehabilitation|clubhouse]]  and [[Community centre|community center]] support and social service models.

In the United States, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) has shown in recent studies that about 5 million Americans qualify to use homeless shelters. As poverty levels continue to rise, it is estimated that the number of homeless shelters, in particular in the United States, will continue to rise.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.homelessshelterssite.org/|title = Homeless Shelters|access-date = 22 July 2015|website = Homeless Shelters}}</ref> Based on a survey of 24 U.S. cities the average stay in a homeless shelter was found to be on average about seven months out of the year.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Homelessness|last = National Coalition for the Homeless|publisher = Greenhaven Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780737759396|location = Farmington Hills, Michigan|pages = [https://archive.org/details/homelessness0000thom/page/71 71]|chapter = Multiple Factors Contribute to Homelessness|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/homelessness0000thom/page/71}}</ref>

=== Statistics of homeless population within the United States ===
{{Main|Homelessness in the United States}}

A study by the [[The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty|National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]] estimates that 2.3 to 3.5 million Americans experience homelessness annually. [[Alaska]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Colorado]], and [[Hawaii]] are the states with the highest concentration of homeless people.  Around 1.5 million children or one of out every 50 children in America are homeless. Many Americans suffer from the state of “chronic homelessness,” which is where an individual has a disabling condition who has been continuously homeless for over a year or has been homeless on at least four different instances within four years. About 23% of the homeless population has been tagged as “chronic homeless.” Veterans also represent close to 40% of homeless men within the United States. [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|Racial demographics]] of the Homeless Population of the United States can be represented as:

* Whites: 39%
* African-Americans: 42%
* Hispanics: 13%
* Native Americans: 4%
* Asians: 2%
Approximately 40% of all homeless youth in the United States identify as [[LGBT]] (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender).<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url = http://nationalhomeless.org/issues/lgbt/|title = LGBT Homelessness|access-date = 22 July 2015|website = National Coalition for the Homeless}}</ref> In [[San Francisco]], approximately 29% of all the homeless in that city are on the LGBT spectrum.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=70764|title = The Bay Area Reporter|last = Hemmelgarn|first = Seth|date = 23 July 2015|access-date = 23 July 2015}}</ref> The [[National Center for Transgender Equality]] reports that 1 in 5 [[transgender]] individuals has experienced being homeless at least once in their lives.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://transequality.org/issues/housing-homelessness|title = Housing & Homelesslessness|access-date = 22 July 2015|website = National Center for Transgender Equality}}</ref>

Pet ownership among the homeless varies, but estimates indicate that about 5 and 10 percent of the homeless in the United States have a pet.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nevadabusiness.com/2015/07/pets-homeless-embarks-sixth-annual-give-dog-bone-week/|title = Pets of the Homeless Embarks on Sixth Annual Give a Dog a Bone Week|last = Walquist|first = Scott|date = 15 July 2015|work = Nevada Business|access-date = 23 July 2015}}</ref>

Homelessness appears to be largely concentrated within urban areas. Central cities hold 71% of the homeless population while the suburbs have 21% of the homeless population. Only 9% of the homeless class can be located within rural areas.

===Operations and role in U.S. society===

Homeless shelters are usually operated by a [[non-profit agency]] or a municipal agency, or are associated with a church. They almost always have Section 501(c)3 corporate organization with a [[Board of directors|Board of Directors]] pulled from various sectors of the community. Often, such Boards include clergy, elected officials, and even shelter residents and people from the surrounding community.

Shelters which are funded by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) require residents to have identification.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/dignity/Content?oid=5546437|title = Dignity|last = Taracena|first = Maria Ines|date = 16 July 2015|work = Tucson Weekly|access-date = 23 July 2015}}</ref>

Homeless shelters often provide other services to the community at large. The classic example is the [[soup kitchen]] for persons who are not staying at the shelter. Others include [[support group]]s, and/or [[substance abuse]] treatment. If they do not offer any of these services, they can usually refer their clients to agencies that do. [[Supportive housing]] integrates services in a more assertive fashion. The typical pathway through the interlocking system is that a person may start in a shelter and move through [[transitional housing]] into [[supportive housing]] and finally independent housing.

Centers in the United States are also often coordinated with outside programs both for their mission-specific operations and for ancillary services. For communication of their availability, most coordinate with the Federally mandated 2-1-1 or the 3-1-1 phone information system which allow needy persons to find out where shelters are located.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} For transportation to shelters, some offer free transportation,[15] particularly in cases of persons being released from jail. Some jails have specific staff assigned to placement of persons being released. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== List of national organizations in the U.S supporting homeless shelters ===
Across the United States there are several national organizations that assist in the founding and the upkeep of homeless shelters. The main national organizations are: 
* [[National Alliance to End Homelessness]]
* [[The Salvation Army]]
* The National Coalition for the Homeless
* The Emergency Food and Shelter Program (United Way)
* The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]
*[[Covenant House]]
*[[Feeding America]]
* [[Housing Assistance Council]]
* Help USA.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.homeless.org.au/directory/shelters.htm|title = Homeless Shelters and Programs|access-date = 22 July 2015|website = Homeless.org}}</ref>

===United States libraries===
Homeless shelters often work with other organizations in order to support and help the homeless improve their situations, including libraries.<ref>American Library Association. (2014). ''Outreach Resources for Services to Poor and Homeless People''. Retrieved From http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/outreachtounderservedpopulations/servicespoor</ref> They often work with the coalition to grant a temporary library card for homeless coalition members who can use a shelter as a local address.  This is intended to give new patrons the opportunity to utilize the computer services, books, programs, and more that the library offers.<ref>Community Legal Aid. (2011). ''Library changes borrowing policy for homeless.''

=== Government assistance programs in the United States ===
Homeless individuals within the United States are assisted through various Federal programs. Examples include the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSD) and the Social Security Supplemental Income (SSI) programs. Such applicants may qualify through their medical records. The Social Security Disability Insurance service extends benefits to families if they have earned sufficient work “credits.” The Social Security Supplemental Income service offers financial assistance towards individuals in need who are disabled, blind or elderly.

[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] estimates that it costs $60,000 each year to house a homeless family in a shelter.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url = https://www.npr.org/2015/07/07/420537082/for-homeless-families-quick-exit-from-shelters-is-only-a-temporary-fix|title = For Homeless Families, Quick Exit From Shelter is Only a Temporary Fix|last = Fessler|first = Pam|date = 7 July 2015|work = National Public Radio (NPR)|access-date = 22 July 2015}}</ref> Because of this, HUD has various programs in place to help families, including rapid rehousing and permanent housing [[voucher]]s.<ref name=":4" /> Housing vouchers from HUD are considered especially important for helping to prevent families with children from becoming homeless and also to help these families be able to leave the shelter system permanently.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Homelessness|last = Sard|first = Barbara|publisher = Greenhaven Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780737759396|location = Farmington Hills, Michigan|chapter = Government Housing Vouchers Help Homeless Families Best|pages = [https://archive.org/details/homelessness0000thom/page/131 131]|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/homelessness0000thom/page/131}}</ref>

One of the main stated goals of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] is to assist [[homeless veterans in the United States|homeless veterans]]. Although this organization assists a specific group of individuals, it currently constitutes the largest network of homeless treatment within the United States.{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}

== Other countries ==

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], due to government funding requirements, most homelessness services fill the role of both daytime and night time shelters. Shelters develop empowerment based "wrap around" services in which residents are case managed and supported in their efforts to become self-reliant. An example of such a service provider in this area in Australia is [[Najidah (Australia)|Najidah]].

Youth refuges in Australia provide both a residential setting for crisis accommodation as well as case management to assist young people to live independently. Youth refuges are a relatively new form of homeless shelters. In New South Wales the early refuges include [[Caretakers Cottage]], Young People's Refuge, Taldamunde Youth Services, all founded in the mid-1970s.<ref>Coffey, Michael.
