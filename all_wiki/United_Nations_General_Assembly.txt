The '''United Nations General Assembly''' ('''UNGA''' or '''GA'''; {{lang-fr|link=no|Assemblée générale}}, AG) is one of the six principal [[organs of the United Nations]] (UN), serving as the main deliberative, policy-making, and representative organ of the UN. Its powers, composition, functions, and procedures are set out in [[Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter]]. The UNGA is responsible for the UN budget, appointing the non-permanent members to the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], appointing the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], receiving reports from other parts of the UN system, and making recommendations through [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]]s.<ref>[https://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/chapter4.htm CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS: Chapter IV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012044607/http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/chapter4.htm |date=12 October 2007 }}. United Nations.</ref> It also establishes numerous [[:Category:United Nations General Assembly subsidiary organs|subsidiary organs]] to advance or assist in its broad mandate.<ref>[https://www.un.org/ga/subsidiary/ General Assembly: Subsidiary organs] at UN.org.</ref> The UNGA is the only UN organ wherein all member states have equal representation.

The General Assembly meets under [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|its president]] or the UN [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|secretary-general]] in annual sessions at [[headquarters of the United Nations|UN headquarters]] in New York City; the main part of these meetings generally run from September to part of January until all issues are addressed (which is often before the next session starts).<ref>{{cite web |last1=United Nations Official Document |title=The annual session convenes on Tuesday of the third week in September per Resolution 57/301, Para. 1. The opening debate begins the following Tuesday |url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/INF/70/1 |website=www.un.org}}</ref> It can also reconvene for special and emergency special sessions. The [[First session of the United Nations General Assembly|first session]] was convened on 10 January 1946 in the [[Methodist Central Hall, Westminster|Methodist Central Hall]] in [[London]] and included representatives of the 51 founding nations.

Voting in the General Assembly on certain important questions—namely recommendations on peace and security; budgetary concerns; and the election, admission, suspension or expulsion of members—is by a [[Supermajority|two-thirds majority]] of those present and voting. Other questions are decided by a simple [[majority]]. Each member country has one vote. Apart from the approval of budgetary matters, including the adoption of a scale of assessment, Assembly resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN, except matters of peace and security under the Security Council consideration. 

During the 1980s, the Assembly became a forum for "North-South dialogue" between industrialized nations and developing countries on a range of international issues. These issues came to the fore because of the phenomenal growth and changing makeup of the UN membership. In 1945, the UN had 51 members, which by the 21st century nearly quadrupled to 193, of which more than two-thirds are [[developing country|developing]]. Because of their numbers, developing countries are often able to determine the agenda of the Assembly (using coordinating groups like the [[Group of 77|G77]]), the character of its debates, and the nature of its decisions. For many developing countries, the UN is the source of much of their diplomatic influence and the principal outlet for their foreign relations initiatives.

Although the resolutions passed by the General Assembly do not have the binding forces over the member nations (apart from budgetary measures), pursuant to its [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|Uniting for Peace]] resolution of November 1950 (resolution 377 (V)), the Assembly may also take action if the Security Council fails to act, owing to the negative vote of a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]], in a case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression. The Assembly can consider the matter immediately with a view to making recommendations to Members for collective measures to maintain or restore international peace and security.<ref name="autogenerated1">[https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/background.shtml General Assembly of the United Nations].

== History ==
[[File:Methodist.central.hall.london.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Methodist Central Hall, Westminster|Methodist Central Hall]], London, the location of the first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of United Nations 1941 – 1950 |url=https://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/1941-1950.shtml |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=12 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312020304/http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/1941-1950.shtml |archive-date=12 March 2015  }}</ref>]]

The first session of the UN General Assembly was convened on 10 January 1946 in the Methodist Central Hall in [[London]] and included representatives of 51 nations. The next few annual sessions were held in different cities: the second session in [[New York City]], and the third in [[Paris]]. It moved to the permanent [[Headquarters of the United Nations]] in New York City at the start of its seventh regular annual session, on 14 October 1952. In December 1988, in order to hear [[Yasser Arafat]], the General Assembly organized its 29th session in the [[Palace of Nations]], in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} "Genève renoue avec sa tradition de ville de paix", ''[[Le Temps]]'', Thursday 16 January 2014.</ref>

== Membership ==
{{main|Member states of the United Nations}}
All 193 members of the United Nations are members of the General Assembly, with the addition of Holy See and Palestine as observer states. Further, the United Nations General Assembly may grant [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer status]] to an international organization or entity, which entitles the entity to participate in the work of the United Nations General Assembly, though with limitations.

== Agenda ==
The agenda for each session is planned up to seven months in advance and begins with the release of a preliminary list of items to be included in the provisional agenda.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/gasess.htm#gaagen |title=Research Guide: General Assembly |publisher=United Nations |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021004337/http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/gasess.htm |archive-date=21 October 2013 }}</ref> This is refined into a provisional agenda 60 days before the opening of the session. After the session begins, the final agenda is adopted in a plenary meeting which allocates the work to the various Main Committees, who later submit reports back to the Assembly for adoption by consensus or by vote.

Items on the agenda are numbered. Regular plenary sessions of the General Assembly in recent years have initially been scheduled to be held over the course of just three months; however, additional workloads have extended these sessions until just short of the next session. The routinely scheduled portions of the sessions normally commence on "the Tuesday of the third week in September, counting from the first week that contains at least one working day", per the UN Rules of Procedure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/sessions.shtml|title=General Assembly of the United Nations}}</ref> The last two of these Regular sessions were routinely scheduled to recess exactly three months afterwards<ref>[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/ga10859.doc.htm General Assembly Adopts Work Programme for Sixty-Fourth Session], UN General Assembly Adopts Work Programme for Sixty-Fourth Session</ref> in early December, but were resumed in January and extended until just before the beginning of the following sessions.<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/ga/64/meetings/index.shtml#sep10 UN Plenary Meetings of the 64th Session of the UN General Assembly], General Assembly of the UN</ref>

The General Assembly votes on many resolutions brought forth by sponsoring states. These are generally statements symbolizing the sense of the international community about an array of world issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ask.un.org/faq/15010|title=Are UN resolutions binding? - Ask DAG!|website=ask.un.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> Most General Assembly resolutions are not enforceable as a legal or practical matter, because the General Assembly lacks enforcement powers with respect to most issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Nations-General-Assembly|title=United Nations General Assembly|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> The General Assembly has authority to make final decisions in some areas such as the United Nations budget.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-iv/index.html|title=Article 17 (1) of Charter of the United Nations|date=17 June 2015}}</ref>

The General Assembly can also refer an issue to the Security Council to put in place a binding resolution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/un-charter-full-text/|title=Articles 11 (2) and 11 (3) of Charter of the United Nations|date=15 April 2016}}</ref>

=== Resolution numbering scheme ===
From the First to the Thirtieth General Assembly sessions, all General Assembly resolutions were numbered consecutively, with the resolution number followed by the session number in Roman numbers (for example, [[:s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514|Resolution 1514 (XV)]], which was the 1514th numbered resolution adopted by the Assembly, and was adopted at the Fifteenth Regular Session (1960)). Beginning in the Thirty-First Session, resolutions are numbered by individual session (for example Resolution 41/10 represents the 10th resolution adopted at the Forty-First Session).

== Budget ==
The General Assembly also approves the budget of the United Nations and decides how much money each member state must pay to run the organization.<ref name="population">[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?order=wbapi_data_value_2011+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=asc Population, total | Data | Table]. World Bank. Retrieved 12 July 2013.</ref>

The Charter of the United Nations gives responsibility for approving the budget to the General Assembly (Chapter IV, Article 17) and for preparing the budget to the Secretary-General, as "chief administrative officer" (Chapter XV, Article 97). The Charter also addresses the non-payment of assessed contributions (Chapter IV, Article 19).
The planning, programming, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation cycle of the United Nations has evolved over the years; major resolutions on the process include General Assembly resolutions: 41/213 of 19 December 1986, 42/211 of 21 December 1987, and 45/248 of 21 December 1990.<ref>[https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/specrb.html#intro UN Security Council : Resolutions, Presidential Statements, Meeting Records, SC Press Releases] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202215845/http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/specrb.html#intro |date=2 December 2012 }}. United Nations. Retrieved 12 July 2013.</ref>

The budget covers the costs of United Nations programmes in areas such as political affairs, international justice and law, international cooperation for development, public information, human rights, and humanitarian affairs.

The main source of funds for the regular budget is the contributions of member states. The scale of assessments is based on the capacity of countries to pay. This is determined by considering their relative shares of total gross national product, adjusted to take into account a number of factors, including their per capita incomes.

In addition to the regular budget, member states are assessed for the costs of the international tribunals and, in accordance with a modified version of the basic scale, for the costs of peacekeeping operations.<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/hq/dm/budget.shtml United Nations Department of Management].

{{legend|#000000| No group}}]]

The General Assembly is entrusted in the United Nations Charter with electing members to various organs within the United Nations system. The procedure for these elections can be found in Section 15 of the Rules of Procedure for the General Assembly. The most important elections for the General Assembly include those for the upcoming [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|President of the General Assembly]], the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], the [[Economic and Social Council of the United Nations|Economic and Social Council]], the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] and the [[International Court of Justice]]. Most elections are held annually, with the exception of the election of judges to the ICJ, which happens triennially.<ref name="RULES/PROCEDURE"/><ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Statute of the International Court of Justice |wslink=Charter of the United Nations |date=26 June 1945 |publisher=United Nations |location=San Francisco}}</ref>

The Assembly annually elects five non-permanent members of the Security Council for two year terms, 18 members of the Economic and Social Council for three-year terms and 14-18 members of the Human Rights Council for three year terms. It also elects the leadership of the next General Assembly session, i.e. the next President of the General Assembly, the 21 Vice-Presidents and the bureaux of the six main committees.<ref name="RULES/PROCEDURE"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/ga12204.doc.htm |title=General Assembly Elects 14 Member States to Human Rights Council, Appoints New Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services |author=United Nations |date=17 October 2019 |website=United Nations Meetings Coverage & Press Releases |publisher=United Nations |access-date=19 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="ELECTION">{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/ga12149.doc.htm |title=Delegates Elect Permanent Representative of Nigeria President of Seventy-Fourth General Assembly by Acclamation, Also Choosing 20 Vice-Presidents |author=United Nations |date=4 June 2019 |website=United Nations Meetings Coverage & Press Releases |publisher=United Nations |access-date=15 September 2019}}</ref>

Elections to the International Court of Justice take place every three years in order to ensure continuity within the court. In these elections, five judges are elected for nine-year terms. These elections are held jointly with the Security Council, with candidates needing to receive an absolute majority of the votes in both bodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.icj-cij.org/en/members |title=Members of the Court |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=International Court of Justice |publisher=International Court of Justice |access-date=19 January 2020}}</ref>

The Assembly also, in conjunction with the Security Council, [[United Nations Secretary-General selection|selects the next Secretary-General]] of the United Nations. The main part of these elections are held in the Security Council, with the General Assembly simply appointing the candidate that receives the Council's nomination.<ref name="SWISS HANDBOOK">{{cite book |last1=Ruder |first1=Nicole |last2=Nakano |first2=Kenji |last3=Aeschlimann |first3=Johann |editor1-last=Aeschlimann |editor1-first=Johann |editor2-last=Regan |editor2-first=Mary |date=2017 |title=The GA Handbook: A practical guide to the United Nations General Assembly |url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/dam/mission-new-york/en/documents/UN_GA__Final.pdf |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Permanent Mission of Switzerland to the United Nations |pages=61–65 |isbn=978-0-615-49660-3}}</ref>

=== Regional groups ===

{{legend|#cc3399|Latin American and Caribbean States (10)}}
{{legend|#cc9900|Western European and Other States (13)}}]]

The [[United Nations Regional Groups]] were created in order to facilitate the equitable geographical distribution of seats among the Member States in different United Nations bodies. Resolution 33/138 of the General Assembly states that “the composition of the various organs of the United Nations should be so constituted as to ensure their representative character.” Thus, member States of the United Nations are informally divided into five regions, with most bodies in the United Nations system having a specific number of seats allocated for each regional group. Additionally, the leadership of most bodies also rotates between the regional groups, such as the presidency of the General Assembly and the chairmanship of the six main committees.<ref name="SWISS HANDBOOK"/><ref>{{UN doc |docid=A/RES/33/138 |body=A |session=33 |type=E |resolution_number=138 |title=Question of the composition of the relevant organs of the United Nations: amendments to rules 31 and 28 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly to rules |date=19 December 1978 |accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref><ref name="UN ENCYCLOPEDIA">{{cite book |last=Winkelmann |first=Ingo |s2cid=159105596 |date=2010 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the United Nations |journal=Choice Reviews Online |volume=48 |issue=2 |editor1-last=Volger |editor1-first=Helmut |edition=2nd  |location=Leiden |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |pages=592–96 |doi=10.5860/choice.48-0623 |isbn=978-90-04-18004-8 }}</ref>

The regional groups work according to the consensus principle. Candidates who are endorsed by them are, as a rule, elected by the General Assembly in any subsequent elections.<ref name="UN ENCYCLOPEDIA"/>

== Sessions ==
=== Regular sessions ===
The General Assembly meets annually in a regular session that opens on the third Tuesday of September, and runs until the following September. Sessions are held at United Nations Headquarters in New York unless changed by the General Assembly by a majority vote.<ref name="RULES/PROCEDURE"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/sessions/regular.shtml |title=Ordinary sessions |date=n.d. |website=United Nations General Assembly |publisher=United Nations |access-date=17 January 2020}}</ref>

The regular session is split into two distinct periods, the main and resumed parts of the session. During the main part of the session, which runs from the opening of the session until Christmas break in December, most of the work of the Assembly is done. This period is the Assembly's most intense period of work and includes the general debate and the bulk of the work of the Main Committees. The resumed part of the session, however, which runs from January until the beginning of the new session, includes most thematic debates, consultation processes led by the President of the General Assembly, and working group meetings.<ref name="Swiss Handbook"/>

The general debate of each new session of the General Assembly is held the week following the official opening of the session, typically the following Tuesday, and is held without interruption for nine working days. The general debate is a high-level event, typically attended by Member States' Heads of [[Heads of State|State]] or [[Head of government|Government]], government ministers and United Nations delegates. At the general debate, Member States are given the opportunity to raise attention to topics or issues that they feel are important. In addition to the general debate, there are also many other high-level thematic meetings, summits and informal events held during general debate week.<ref name="UN HANDBOOK">{{cite journal |editor1-last=Manhire |editor1-first=Vanessa |date=2019 |title=United Nations Handbook 2019-20 |journal=United Nations Handbook (Wellington, N.z.). |url=https://www.mfat.govt.nz/assets/Peace-Rights-and-Security/Our-work-with-the-UN/UN-Handbook-2019-20.pdf |edition=57th |location=Wellington |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand |page=17 |issn= 0110-1951}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ask.un.org/faq/154658 |title=What is the general debate of the General Assembly?

The General debate is held in the General Assembly Hall at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.

=== Special sessions ===
{{Main|Special session of the United Nations General Assembly}}

Special sessions, or UNGASS, may be convened in three different ways, at the request of the Security Council, at the request of a majority of United Nations members States or by a single member, as long as a majority concurs. Special sessions typically cover one single topic and end with the adoption of one or two outcome documents, such as a political declaration, action plan or strategy to combat said topic. They are also typically high-level events with participation from heads of state and government, as well as by government ministers. There have been 30 special sessions in the history of the United Nations.<ref name="Swiss Handbook">{{cite book |last1=Ruder |first1=Nicole |last2=Nakano |first2=Kenji |last3=Aeschlimann |first3=Johann |editor1-last=Aeschlimann |editor1-first=Johann |editor2-last=Regan |editor2-first=Mary |date=2017 |title=The GA Handbook: A practical guide to the United Nations General Assembly |url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/dam/mission-new-york/en/documents/UN_GA__Final.pdf |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Permanent Mission of Switzerland to the United Nations |pages=14–15 |isbn=978-0-615-49660-3}}</ref><ref name="CHARTER">{{cite wikisource |title=Charter of the United Nations |wslink=Charter of the United Nations |date=26 June 1945 |publisher=United Nations |location=San Francisco}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/sessions/special.shtml |title=Special sessions |date=n.d. |website=United Nations General Assembly |publisher=United Nations |access-date=17 January 2020}}</ref>

=== Emergency special sessions ===
{{Main|Emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly}}

In the event that the Security Council is unable, usually due to disagreement among the permanent members, to come to a decision on a threat to international peace and security, the General Assembly may call an emergency special session in order to make appropriate recommendations to Members States for collective measures. This power was given to the Assembly in [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|Resolution 377(V)]] of 3 November 1950.<ref name="Swiss Handbook"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/sessions/emergency.shtml |title=Emergency Special sessions |date=n.d. |website=United Nations General Assembly |publisher=United Nations |access-date=17 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{UN doc |docid=A/RES/377(V) |body=A |session=5 |type=R |resolution_number=377 |title=Uniting for Peace |date=3 November 1950 |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>

Emergency special sessions can be called by the Security Council, if supported by at least seven members, or by a majority of Member States of the United Nations. If enough votes are had, the Assembly must meet within 24 hours, with Members being notified at least twelve hours before the opening of the session. There have been 10 emergency special sessions in the history of the United Nations.<ref name="RULES/PROCEDURE">{{UN doc |docid=A/520/Rev.18 |body=A |type=D |document_number=520/Rev.18 |title=Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly |date=September 2016 |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>

== Subsidiary organs ==
[[File:UN General Assembly building.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|The United Nations General Assembly building]]
[[File:Panorama of the United Nations General Assembly, Oct 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Panorama of the UNGA]]
The General Assembly subsidiary organs are divided into five categories: committees (30 total, six main), commissions (six), boards (seven), councils (four) and panels (one), working groups, and "other".

=== Committees ===

==== Main committees ====
The main committees are [[ordinal number|ordinally numbered]], 1–6:<ref name="main" />
*The First Committee: [[United Nations General Assembly First Committee|Disarmament and International Security]] (DISEC) is concerned with disarmament and related international security questions
*The Second Committee: [[United Nations General Assembly Second Committee|Economic and Financial]] (ECOFIN) is concerned with economic questions
*The Third Committee: [[United Nations General Assembly Third Committee|Social, Cultural, and Humanitarian]] (SOCHUM) deals with social and humanitarian issues
*The Fourth Committee: [[United Nations General Assembly Fourth Committee|Special Political and Decolonisation]] (SPECPOL) deals with a variety of political subjects not dealt with by the First Committee, as well as with decolonization
*The Fifth Committee: [[United Nations General Assembly Fifth Committee|Administrative and Budgetary and general]] deals with the administration and budget of the United Nations
*The Sixth Committee: [[United Nations General Assembly Sixth Committee|Legal]] deals with legal matters

The roles of many of the main committees have changed over time. Until the late 1970s, the First Committee was the Political and Security Committee (POLISEC) and there was also a sufficient number of additional "political" matters that an additional, unnumbered main committee, called the Special Political Committee, also sat. The Fourth Committee formerly handled Trusteeship and Decolonization matters. With the decreasing number of such matters to be addressed as the [[United Nations Trust Territories|trust territories]] attained independence and the [[decolonization]] movement progressed, the functions of the Special Political Committee were merged into the Fourth Committee during the 1990s.

Each main committee consists of all the members of the General Assembly. Each elects a chairman, three vice chairmen, and a [[rapporteur]] at the outset of each regular General Assembly session.

== Reform and UNPA ==

On 21 March 2005, [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] presented a report, ''In Larger Freedom'', that criticized the General Assembly for focusing so much on consensus that it was passing watered-down resolutions reflecting "the lowest common denominator of widely different opinions".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/59/2005|title=Report of the Secretary-General in Larger Freedom towards development, security and human rights for all}}</ref> He also criticized the Assembly for trying to address too broad an agenda, instead of focusing on "the major substantive issues of the day, such as international [[human migration|migration]] and the long-debated comprehensive convention on terrorism". Annan recommended streamlining the General Assembly's agenda, committee structure, and procedures; strengthening the role and authority of its [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|president]]; enhancing the role of [[civil society]]; and establishing a mechanism to review the decisions of its committees, in order to minimize [[unfunded mandate]]s and [[micromanagement]] of the [[United Nations Secretariat]]. Annan reminded UN members of their responsibility to implement reforms, if they expect to realize improvements in UN effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/largerfreedom/chap5.htm|title=In Larger Freedom, Chapter 5|publisher=United Nations}}</ref>

The reform proposals were not taken up by the United Nations World Summit in September 2005. Instead, the Summit solely affirmed the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations, as well as the advisory role of the Assembly in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law. The Summit also called for strengthening the relationship between the General Assembly and the other principal organs to ensure better coordination on topical issues that required coordinated action by the United Nations, in accordance with their respective mandates.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnstone|first=Ian|date=2008|title=Legislation and Adjudication in the UN Security Council: Bringing down the Deliberative Deficit|journal=American Journal of International Law|volume=Vol. 102.

A United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, or United Nations People's Assembly (UNPA), is a proposed addition to the United Nations System that eventually could allow for direct election of UN parliament members by citizens all over the world.

In the General Debate of the 65th General Assembly, [[Jorge Valero]], representing [[Venezuela]], said "The United Nations has exhausted its model and it is not simply a matter of proceeding with reform, the twenty-first century demands deep changes that are only possible with a rebuilding of this organisation." He pointed to the futility of resolutions concerning the [[United States embargo against Cuba|Cuban embargo]] and the [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|Middle East conflict]] as reasons for the UN model having failed. Venezuela also called for the suspension of veto rights in the Security Council because it was a "remnant of the Second World War [it] is incompatible with the principle of sovereign equality of States".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Assembly |first1=General |title=Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of H.E. Mr. Jorge Valero Briceño, Chairman of the Delegation |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/65/meetings/generaldebate/View/SpeechView/tabid/85/smid/411/ArticleID/297/reftab/235/t/Venezuela-Bolivarian-Republic-of/Default.html |website=www.un.org}}</ref>

Reform of the United Nations General Assembly includes proposals to change the powers and composition of the U.N. General Assembly. This could include, for example, tasking the Assembly with evaluating how well member states implement UNGA resolutions,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/images/pdfs/04revitalization.pdf|title= REVITALIZATION OF THE WORK OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY |publisher=Globalpolicy.org|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> increasing the power of the assembly vis-à-vis the [[United Nations Security Council]], or making debates more constructive and less repetitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/international-organizations-and-alliances/role-un-general-assembly/p13490|title=The Role of the UN General Assembly|work=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>

==Sidelines of the General Assembly==
The annual session of the United Nations General Assembly is accompanied by independent meetings between world leaders, better known as meetings taking place on the ''sidelines'' of the Assembly meeting. The diplomatic congregation has also since evolved into a week attracting wealthy and influential individuals from around the world to New York City to address various agendas, ranging from humanitarian and environmental to business and political.<ref name=NYCGlobalMeeting>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/business/ceos-un-week.html|title=It's the U.N.'s Week, but Executives Make It a High-Minded Mingle|author=David Gelles|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 September 2017|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref>
