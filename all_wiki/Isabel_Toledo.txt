==Personal life==
Toledo was born Maria Isabel Izquierdo in Camajuaní, Cuba.<ref name = NYT/> Raised in West New York, New Jersey after settling in the United States at the age of eight, she attended [[Memorial High School (West New York, New Jersey)|Memorial High School]], where she met her future husband and collaborator, [[Ruben Toledo]], whom she married in 1984.<ref name = NYT/><ref>Akkad, Nour. [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/isabel-toledo-michelle-ob_n_159373 "Isabel Toledo: Michelle Obama's Inauguration Dress Designer"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', February 20, 2009. Accessed August 29, 2019. "Born Isabel Izquierdo in Cuba where she lived until the age of 8, Toledo grew up in West New York and attended Memorial High School, where she met her husband, the artist Rubén Toledo."</ref> Toledo told CNN that she started sewing at age eight because "I couldn’t find anything I loved."<ref name = NYT/> She attended the Fashion Institute of Technology (NY) and Parsons School of Design (NY),<ref name = NYT/> where she studied painting, ceramics, and fashion design.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} She left Parsons in 1979, then graduated to become an intern under [[Diana Vreeland]] at the [[Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art]].<ref name = NYT/>

Toledo died from breast cancer at a hospital in Manhattan on August 26, 2019.<ref name = NYT/>

==Career==
Toledo presented her first collection in 1984 at [[Danceteria]], with the help of her friend [[Joey Arias]], who organized the events, and became an official participant in [[New York Fashion Week]] in 1985. Her work was soon being sold by [[Barneys New York]], [[Colette (boutique)|Colette]] in Paris, and [[Joyce Boutique]] in Hong Kong. Her work became influential in the world of design. According to the Israeli designer [[Alber Elbaz]], "Everybody sort of stole from Isabel. Her work was about volume, cut, experiments, a laboratory of fabric — and that was not an Instagram moment. It was fashion."<ref name=NYT/>

In 1998, she stopped presenting biannual collections, instead choosing to create on her own schedule.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Toledo was named creative director of [[Anne Klein]] in 2006 after more than twenty years of working solely under her own name, and this allowed her work to reach a wider public.<ref name=NYT/> Toledo made her debut with Anne Klein at New York Fashion Week in February 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Designers in a Time of Many Dresses, Some Terrific |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/fashion/shows/13REVIEW.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 13, 2007 |page=B.8 |first=Cathy |last=Horyn}} Quote: Ms. Toledo’s tunics and sundresses, by contrast, will probably find fewer customers. They were complex in color and pattern, surprising in their design, and for that reason more interesting.</ref> Toledo and Anne Klein parted ways later in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}
