{{short description|World's first senior and mid-career master's degree in general management and leadership}}
The '''Sloan Fellows''' program is the world's first mid-career and senior career [[master's degree]] in [[general management]] and [[leadership]]. It was initially supported by a grant from [[Alfred P. Sloan]], the late CEO of [[General Motors]], to his alma mater, [[MIT]]. The program was established in 1930 at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. Later it was expanded to the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] (1957), and [[London Business School]] (1968). Considered to be one of the most prestigious management training programs in the world, it targets experienced leaders who have demonstrated success either within organizations, or independently as entrepreneurs. Notable alumni include [[Kofi Annan]], former [[United Nations]] Secretary-General and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Laureate (MIT, '72), [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley]], former chairman and CEO of [[BP]] and member of the British [[House of Lords]] (Stanford, '81), and [[Carly Fiorina]], former CEO of [[Hewlett-Packard]] (MIT, '89).

==History==
The Sloan Fellows Program was created at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in 1930, by [[Alfred P. Sloan]], Chairman of [[General Motors]] from 1937 to 1956, who envisioned the Sloan Fellowship as a means of developing the "ideal manager".  The Sloan Fellows Program is the world's first general management and leadership education program for mid-career experienced managers.

In the following decades, the program was expanded to include the Sloan Master's at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford Graduate School of Business|title=Stanford Sloan Master's Program|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sloan/|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> (1957<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford GSB|title=The Sloan Program at 50|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0708/feature-sloan.html|publisher=Stanford GSB|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>) and the Sloan Master's at [[London Business School]]<ref>{{cite web|last=London Business School|title=Sloan Masters in Leadership and Strategy|url=http://www.london.edu/programmes/sloanmastersinleadershipandstrategy.html|publisher=London Business School|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> (1968<ref>{{cite web|last=London Business School|title=Sloan 40th anniversary|url=http://www.london.edu/programmes/sloanmastersinleadershipandstrategy/sloan40.html?WT.mc_id=1863|publisher=London Business School|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>). In 2013, Stanford changed the name of its Sloan Fellows Program to Stanford MSx (Master of Science in Management for Experienced Leaders), though participants in the program remain Stanford Sloan Fellows.<ref>Stanford renames Sloan Master's Program - http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/headlines/redesigned-sloan-masters-curriculum-named-stanford-msx-program-experienced-leaders</ref>

==Academics==
Sloan Fellows comprise a mix of company and self-sponsored candidates. At all three schools, a significant degree of experience is required for admission. Alumni describe the program as "transformational", in keeping with [[Alfred P. Sloan]]'s original vision of preparing accomplished managers for senior business leadership positions and increasingly, launching successful enterprise ventures.

The Sloan Fellows program is delivered full-time over the course of 12–14 months, depending on electives. [[London Business School]] and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|MIT&nbsp;Sloan]] offer an optional research thesis.<ref>[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/fellows/calendar-fulltime.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620131409/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/fellows/calendar-fulltime.php |date=June 20, 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sloan/ International Study Trip]</ref><ref>[http://www.london.edu/sloanfellowship/Programme%20details.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622050804/http://www.london.edu/sloanfellowship/Programme%20details.html |date=June 22, 2007 }}</ref>

The program recognizes the importance of developing leadership and management competency in Sloan Fellows. As such, in addition to the standard MBA curriculum of management courses, the Sloan program contains a strong [[personal development]] component designed to develop the leadership and strategic thinking capabilities of Sloan Fellows. The London Business School Sloan Master's is a specialized program emphasizing strategy, leadership and an intensive personal development provision.

==Admission==
Admission to the [[Sloan Fellow]] programs is highly selective. At the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], the prospective applicant needs to first register interest through the program website and upload a resume. After an initial screening, a member of the admissions committee will contact the registered applicant to schedule a 30 minute phone orientation. Prospective applicants are invited to visit the program in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] for class visits, to engage with current students and meet the program officers.

After the initial screening, applicants submit a formal application, which includes undergraduate transcripts, [[Graduate Management Admission Test|GMAT]] or [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]] score report, letters of recommendation, and personal essays. The received applications are screened by the admissions committee, and selected applicants are invited for a formal admissions interview, usually held on campus, or via video conference for international students. Following the interview, admissions decisions are made and applicants are notified. This process is repeated three times for three rounds of application deadlines.
