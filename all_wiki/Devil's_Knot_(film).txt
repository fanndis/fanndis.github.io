==Plot==
In 1993, in the working class, deeply religious community of [[West Memphis]], [[Arkansas]], three eight-year-old [[West Memphis Three#Victims|boys]] – Stevie Branch, Christopher Byers, and Michael Moore – go missing from their neighborhood. After an extensive search, their bound and beaten bodies are found the next day. The community and the police department are convinced that the murders are the work of a [[satanic cult]], due to the violent and sexual natures of the crime. A month later, [[West Memphis Three#Baldwin.2C Echols.2C and Misskelley|three teenagers]] – Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley Jr. – are arrested after Misskelley confesses to the murders following 12 hours of [[interrogation]]. They are taken to trial, where Baldwin and Misskelley are sentenced to [[life in prison]], and Echols to [[capital punishment|death]], all the while proclaiming their innocence.

During the trial, the defense team's investigator, Ron Lax, uncovers evidence suggesting that the police mishandled and suppressed evidence in the case. This evidence includes blood evidence that was lost, a sighting of a never-identified man covered in blood and mud entering a restaurant near the site of the murders on the night the boys were killed, as well as a confession to the murders by a man named Chris Morgan, which may or may not have been coerced. The prosecution's two chief witnesses - a boy who claims in fantastic detail to have seen the murders and been forced to drink the victims' blood, and his mother, who claims to have heard Echolls confess - are found to be compromised. Meanwhile, Pam Hobbs, Stevie's mother, begins to suspect that her husband (and Stevie's stepfather) Terry killed the boy, especially after finding Stevie's prized Swiss Army knife in Terry's toolkit. Lax visits Pam, who expresses doubt about the verdict; Lax replies that, while he does not know who committed the murders, he knows in his heart that his clients are innocent. Soon afterward, Pam leaves her husband.

A series of title cards describe the aftermath of the trial: In August 2011, after nearly 20 years in prison, Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley were given a new trial and released after entering an [[Alford plea]], under which they remain convicted felons;<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Abby|last=Rogers|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/west-memphis-3-and-the-alford-plea-2012-12|title=A Little-Known Legal Maneuver Let 3 Men Convicted Of Murder Get Out Of Jail While Still Admitting Guilt|magazine=[[Business Insider]]|publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]]|location=New York City|date=December 22, 2012|accessdate=September 6, 2018}}</ref> the boy and his mother, who testified against the defendants recanted; Lax discovered a hair sample from the crime scene that resembled Terry Hobbs' [[DNA]];<ref name="legal">{{cite news|first=Mara|last=Leveritt|url=https://www.arktimes.com/arkansas/the-legal-troubles-of-terry-hobbs-and-john-mark-byers/Content?oid=2091927|title=The legal troubles of Terry Hobbs and John Mark Byers|newspaper=[[Arkansas Times]]|publisher=Arkansas Times Limited Partnership|location=Little Rock, Arkansas|date=November 25, 1994|accessdate=September 6, 2018}}</ref> the wife of John Mark Byers, the father of one of the victims, was found dead under "unsolved" circumstances;<ref name="legal"/> and Pam Hobbs continued to look for the truth about her son's murder.
