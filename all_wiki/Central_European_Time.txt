'''Central European Time''' ('''CET'''), used in most parts of [[Europe]] and a few [[North Africa]]n countries, is a [[standard time]] which is 1&nbsp;hour ahead of [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). The [[time offset]] from [[UTC]] can be written as [[UTC+01:00]]. The same standard time, [[UTC+01:00]], is also known as '''Middle European Time''' (MET, German: [[:de:MEZ|MEZ]]) and under other names like '''Berlin Time''', '''Warsaw Time''', '''Paris Time''' or '''Rome Time'''.

The [[15th meridian east]] is the central axis for [[UTC+01:00]] in the world system of [[time zones]].

As of 2011, all [[member states of the European Union]] observe summer time; those that during the winter use CET use [[Central European Summer Time]] (CEST) (or: [[UTC+02:00]], [[daylight saving time]]) in summer (from last Sunday of March to last Sunday of October).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/europe-starts-dst-2011.html|title=Europe Starts Daylight Saving on March 27, 2011|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref>

A number of African countries use [[UTC+01:00]] all year long, where it is called [[West Africa Time]] (WAT),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/wat|title=WAT – West Africa Time (Time Zone Abbreviation)|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref> although [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]] also use the term ''Central European Time''.<ref name="cetusage">{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldtimeserver.com/time-zones/CET/|title=Central European Time Zone - CET|date=2015-11-19|work=WorldTimeServer.com|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-US}}</ref>

;United Kingdom
The time around the world is based on [[Universal Coordinated Time]] (UTC) which is roughly synonymous with [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT). From late March to late October, clocks in the [[United Kingdom]] are put forward by one hour for [[British Summer Time]] (BST). Since 1997, most of the European Union aligned with the British standards for BST.

In 1968<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Summer Time all the time |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002135/19680213/623/0027 |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |location=England |date=13 February 1968 |access-date=16 July 2018 |via=British Newspaper Archive |url-access=subscription }}</ref> there was a three-year experiment called ''British Standard Time'', when the UK and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] experimentally employed [[British Summer Time]] (GMT+1) all year round; clocks were put forward in March 1968 and not put back until October 1971.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Clocks to be turned back |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002135/19711002/460/0017 |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |location=England |date=2 October 1971 |access-date=16 July 2018 |via=British Newspaper Archive |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

Central European Time is sometimes referred to as [[continental time]] in the UK.

=== Other countries ===
Several African countries use [[UTC+01:00]] all year long, where it called [[West Africa Time]] (WAT), although [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]] also use the term ''Central European Time'', despite being located in [[North Africa]].<ref name="cetusage"/>

Between 2005 and 2008, [[Tunisia]] observed [[daylight saving time]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/tunisia/tunis?year=2005|title=Daylight Saving Time Changes 2005 in Tunis, Tunisia|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> [[Libya]] also used CET during the years 1951&ndash;1959, 1982&ndash;1989, 1996&ndash;1997 and 2012&ndash;2013.

For other countries see [[UTC+01:00]] and [[West Africa Time]].

Legal, political and economic, as well as physical or geographical criteria are used in the drawing of time zones so official time zones rarely adhere to meridian lines. The CET time zone, were it drawn by purely geographical terms, would consist of exactly the area between meridians 7°30′ E and 22°30′ E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a "physical" or "nominal" [[UTC+01:00]] time, actually use another time zone ([[UTC+02:00]] in particular – there are no "physical" [[UTC+01:00]] areas that employ [[UTC+00:00]]). Conversely, there are European areas that have gone for [[UTC+01:00]], even though their "physical" time zone is UTC (typically), [[UTC−01:00]] (westernmost [[Spain]]), or [[UTC+02:00]] (e.g. the very easternmost parts of [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]] and [[Serbia]]). On the other hand, the people in Spain still have all work and meal hours one hour later than France and Germany even if they have the same time zone.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1004788/in-spain-a-time-zone-influenced-by-nazi-germany-has-workers-facing-long-days/|title=Spain spent the last 76 years in the wrong time zone—and it's not healthy for workers|last=Purdy|first=Chase|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}</ref> Following is a list of such "incongruences":

Historically [[Gibraltar]] maintained [[UTC+01:00]] all year until the opening of the land frontier with Spain in 1982 when it followed its neighbour and introduced CEST.

* The easternmost part of [[North Macedonia]], including the city of [[Strumica]]
* The easternmost part of [[Serbia]], in the [[Pirot District]], including the city of [[Pirot]], and small easternmost parts of [[Bor District]].

The easternmost town in [[Norway]], [[Vardø (town)|Vardø]], lies at 30°51′ E, which is so far east, so as to be east even of the central meridian of EET ([[UTC+02:00]]), i.e. east of [[Istanbul]] and [[Alexandria]]. The sun reaches its highest point at 10:56 (when not DST), although the sun does not vary so much in height at the latitude 70°N. <br>The [[Norway|Norwegian]]–[[Russia]]n and the [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Belarus]]sian border are the only places where CET (UTC+1/+2) borders Moscow time ([[UTC+03:00]]), resulting in a two hours time change (or one hour in summer) for the travellers crossing that border.
* There is a "tri-zone" point (where [[UTC+01:00]], [[UTC+02:00]], and [[UTC+03:00]] meet, winter times) at the [[Norway]]–[[Finland]]–[[Russia]] tripoint near [[Muotkavaara]]. During the summer Finland and Russia both have [[UTC+03:00]].
