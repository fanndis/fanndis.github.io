The university's main campus is located on the northern slope of [[Mount Royal]] in the neighbourhoods of [[Outremont (borough)|Outremont]] and [[Côte-des-Neiges]]. The institution comprises thirteen faculties, more than sixty departments and two<ref>[http://www.umontreal.ca/english/overview/overview.html General overview of Université de Montréal]</ref> affiliated schools: the [[Polytechnique Montréal]] (School of Engineering; formerly the École Polytechnique de Montréal) and [[HEC Montréal]] (School of Business). It offers more than 650 undergraduate programmes and graduate programmes, including 71 doctoral programmes.

The university was founded as a satellite campus of the [[Université Laval]] in 1878. It became an independent institution after it was issued a papal charter in 1919 and a provincial charter in 1920. Université de Montréal moved from Montreal's [[Quartier Latin, Montreal|Quartier Latin]] to its present location at [[Mount Royal]] in 1942. It was made a secular institution with the passing of another provincial charter in 1967.

The school is co-educational, and has 34,335 undergraduate and 11,925 post-graduate students (excluding affiliated schools). Alumni and former students reside across Canada and around the world, with notable alumni serving as government officials, academics, and business leaders.

==History==
The Université de Montréal was founded in 1878 as a new branch of [[Université Laval]] in Quebec City. It was then known as the Université Laval à Montréal.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref> The move initially went against the wishes of Montréal's [[prelate]], who advocated an independent university in his city.<ref>[http://www.125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1878-a.html Université de Montréal – Fêtes du 125<sup>e</sup> – 125 ans d'histoire (1878–2003)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Certain parts of the institution's educational facilities, such as those of the [[Séminaire de Québec]] and the Faculty of Medicine (founded as the Montreal School of Medicine and Surgery), had already been established in Montréal in 1876 and 1843, respectively.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/university/ The Canadian Encyclopedia – University]</ref>

The [[Holy See|Vatican]] granted the university some administrative autonomy in 1889, thus allowing it to choose its own professors and license its own diplomas. However, it was not until 8 May 1919 that a papal charter from [[Pope Benedict XV]] granted full autonomy to the university.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/universite-de-montreal/ The Canadian Encyclopedia – Université de Montréal]</ref> It thus became an independent Catholic university and adopted Université de Montréal as its name.<ref>[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1878-f.html Université de Montréal – Fêtes du 125<sup>e</sup> – 125 ans d'histoire (1878–2003)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Université de Montréal was granted its first provincial charter on 14 February 1920.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

At the time of its creation, fewer than a hundred students were admitted to the university's three faculties, which at that time were located in [[Vieux-Montréal|Old Montreal]]. These were the Faculty of Theology (located at the [[Grand séminaire de Montréal]]), the Faculty of Law (hosted by the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice]]), and the Faculty of Medicine (at the [[Château Ramezay]]).<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.umontreal.ca/english/overview/brief_history.html Université de Montréal – English – Brief History]</ref><ref>[http://www.umontreal.ca/infogen/en_bref/historique.html Université de Montréal – Information générale<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913135914/http://www.umontreal.ca/infogen/en_bref/historique.html |date=13 September 2008 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

[[Graduate school|Graduate training]] based on German-inspired American models of specialized coursework and completion of a research thesis was introduced and adopted.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Most of Québec's secondary education establishments employed classic course methods of varying quality. This forced the university to open a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in 1887 to harmonize the education level of its students. Named the "Faculty of Arts", this school would remain in use until 1972 and was the predecessor of Québec's current [[CEGEP]] system.<ref>[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1878-a.html Université de Montréal – Fêtes du 125<sup>e</sup> – 125 ans d'histoire (1878–2003)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>
[[File:Université Laval à Montréal 1903.jpg|thumb|The former main building of the university from 1895 to 1942. The building is located in Montreal's [[Quartier Latin, Montreal|Quartier Latin]].]]
Two distinct schools eventually became affiliated to the university. The first was the [[Polytechnique Montréal|École Polytechnique]], a school of engineering, which was founded in 1873 and became affiliated in 1887. The second was the [[HEC Montréal|École des Hautes Études Commerciales]], or HEC (a business school), which was founded in 1907 and became part of the university in 1915.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> In 1907, Université de Montréal opened the first francophone school of architecture in Canada at the École Polytechnique.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/architectural-education/ The Canadian Encyclopedia – Architectural Education]</ref>

Between 1920 and 1925, seven new faculties were added: Philosophy, Literature, Sciences, Veterinary Medicine, Dental Surgery, Pharmacy, and Social Sciences.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Notably, the Faculty of Social Sciences was founded in 1920 by [[Édouard Montpetit]], the first [[Laïcité|laic]] to lead a faculty.<ref>[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1919-b.html Université de Montréal – Fêtes du 125<sup>e</sup> – 125 ans d'histoire (1878–2003)<!-- Bot generated title -->]  {{in lang|fr}}</ref> He thereafter was named secretary-general, a role he fulfilled until 1950.

From 1876 to 1895, most classes took place in the [[Grand séminaire de Montréal]]. From 1895 to 1942, the school was housed in a building at the intersection of [[Rue Saint-Denis (Montreal)|Saint-Denis]] and [[Rue Sainte-Catherine (Montreal)|Sainte-Catherine]] streets in Montreal's eastern downtown [[Quartier Latin, Montreal|Quartier Latin]]. Unlike English-language universities in Montréal, such as [[McGill University]], Université de Montréal suffered a lack of funding for two major reasons: the relative poverty of the [[French Canadian]] population and the complications ensuing from its being managed remotely, from Quebec City. The downtown campus was hit by three different fires between 1919 and 1921, further complicating the university's already precarious finances and forcing it to spend much of its resources on repairing its own infrastructure.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1919-a.html Université de Montréal – Fêtes du 125<sup>e</sup> – 125 ans d'histoire (1878–2003)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

By 1930, enough funds had been accumulated to start the construction of a new campus on the northwest slope of [[Mount Royal]], adopting new plans designed by [[Ernest Cormier]]. However, the [[Great Depression|financial crisis of the 1930s]] virtually suspended all ongoing construction.<ref>[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1919-d.html Université de Montréal – Fêtes du 125<sup>e</sup> – 125 ans d'histoire (1878–2003)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Many speculated that the university would have to sell off its unfinished building projects to ensure its own survival. Not until 1939 did the [[Politics of Québec|provincial government]] directly intervene by injecting public funds.<ref>[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1919-f.html Université de Montréal – Fêtes du 125<sup>e</sup> – 125 ans d'histoire (1878–2003)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

In 1943, the university assisted the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] by providing [[Montreal Laboratory|laboratory accommodations]] on its campus. Scientists there worked to develop a nuclear reactor, notably by conducting various [[heavy water]] experiments. The research was part of the larger [[Manhattan Project]], which aimed to develop the first [[atomic bomb]]. Scientists working on the school's campus eventually produced the first [[atomic battery]] to work outside of the United States. One of the participating Québec scientists, Pierre Demers, also discovered a series of radioactive elements issued from [[Neptunium]].<ref>[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1943-a.html#b Université de Montréal – Fêtes du 125<sup>e</sup> – 125 ans d'histoire (1878–2003)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

Université de Montréal was issued its second provincial charter in 1950.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> A new government policy of higher education during the 1960s (following the [[Quiet Revolution]]) came in response to popular pressure and the belief that higher education was key to social justice and economic productivity.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> The policy led to the school's third provincial charter, which was passed in 1967. It defined the Université de Montréal as a public institution, dedicated to higher learning and research, with students and teachers having the right to participate in the school's administration.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

In 1965, the appointment of the university's first secular rector, [[Roger Gaudry]], paved the way for modernization. The school established its first adult-education degree program offered by a [[French Canadian]] university in 1968. That year the ''Lionel-Groulx'' and ''3200 Jean-Brillant'' buildings were inaugurated, the former being named after Quebec nationalist [[Lionel Groulx]]. The following year, the Louis Collin parking garage—which won a [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's medal]] for its architecture in 1970—was erected.

An important event that marked the university's history was the [[École Polytechnique massacre]]. On 6 December 1989, a gunman armed with a rifle entered the École Polytechnique building, killing 14 people, all of whom were women, before taking his own life.

Since 2002, the university has embarked on its largest construction project since the late 1960s, with the construction of five new buildings planned for advanced research in pharmacology, engineering, aerospace, cancer studies and biotechnology.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

The incubator is part on the main Campus of Université de Montréal and was built in the fall of 2004 with the aim of helping R&D-intensive startup companies by providing complete infrastructures at advantageous conditions. The environment helps promote collaboration between industries and academics while encouraging Quebec [[entrepreneurship]]. Since its creation the Incubator has hosted more than fifteen companies, mainly in the biomedical field, in the field of polymer/surface treatment, in optics/photonics (like [[Photon etc.]]) and in IT security (like [[ESET]]).

The [[Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal]] (CHUM) and the [[Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine]] are the two teaching hospital networks of the [[Université de Montréal Faculty of Medicine|Université de Montréal's Faculty of Medicine]], although the latter is also affiliated with other medical institutions such as the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal, [[Montreal Heart Institute]], Hôpital Sacré-Coeur and [[Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont]].

====Campus MIL====
[[File:Complexe des sciences - Universite de Montreal - 030.jpg|thumb|The science building at Campus MIL, while it is still under construction in April 2019]]
The University of Montreal's master plan includes the construction of new institutional spaces in the borough of Outremont, Montreal. The campus accessible by two metro stations (Outremont and Acadie), will include teaching and research rooms. The premises are built in accordance with LEED eco-certification.
The MIL campus (which derives its name from "Milieu", which means middle in French<ref>{{Cite web|title=Campus MIL {{!}} Campus MIL|url=https://campusmil.umontreal.ca/|access-date=25 June 2020|language=fr-CA}}</ref>) has been under construction since 2016<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fortin|first=Jean-Frédérick|title=Complexe des sciences de l'Université de Montréal: opération séduction|url=https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2016/04/10/operation-seduction|access-date=25 June 2020|website=Le Journal de Montréal}}</ref>. At the centre of the campus lies the Science Complex, which opened in 2019.

The opening of the MIL Campus generated controversy and attracted criticism from various community organizations in Parc-Extension, one of the poorest neighborhoods in Montreal<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Goudreault|first=Zacharie|date=2 June 2020|title=Parc-Extension: hausse des évictions en raison du campus MIL|url=https://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/2457648/parc-extension-hausse-des-evictions-et-des-loyers-en-raison-du-campus-mil/|access-date=25 June 2020|website=Journal Métro|language=fr-FR}}</ref>. In the fall of 2019, the opening of the campus was disrupted by the Parc-Extension Action Committee (CAPE) to denounce the increasing number of tenants who are evicted from their apartments to make more units available for students in the neighborhood<ref>{{Cite news|last=CBC|date=20 September 2019|title=Take a tour of Université de Montréal's sparkling new campus|work=CBC|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/universite-de-montreal-new-campus-1.5291237|access-date=25 June 2020}}</ref>. More recently, these organizations claimed that the arrival of the campus has encouraged a significant increase in evictions and rental prices in Parc-Extension<ref name=":0" />.
Researchers from three Montreal universities – McGill University, Concordia University and the University of Quebec in Montreal – implemented the Parc-Extension anti-eviction mapping project in 2019, in collaboration with CAPE<ref>{{Cite web|last=International|first=Radio Canada|date=1 June 2020|title=Projet de cartographie anti-éviction dans un quartier défavorisé de Montréal|url=https://www.rcinet.ca/fr/2020/06/15/projet-de-cartographie-anti-eviction-dans-un-quartier-defavorise-de-montreal/|access-date=25 June 2020|website=RCI {{!}} Français|language=fr-FR}}</ref>.
