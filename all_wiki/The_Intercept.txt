''The Intercept'' has published in English since its founding, and in Portuguese since the 2016 launch of the Brazilian edition staffed by a local team of Brazilian journalists.

''The Intercept'' was launched in February 2014, by [[First Look Media]], which is funded by [[eBay]] founder [[Pierre Omidyar]].<ref name="nextweb launch">{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Jon|title=The Intercept, the first online publication from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, is now live|url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2014/02/10/the-intercept-the-first-online-publication-from-ebay-founder-pierre-omidyar-is-now-live/|access-date=December 7, 2015|newspaper=The Next Web|date=February 10, 2014}}</ref> The publication initially reported on documents released by [[Edward Snowden]].<ref name=launch>{{cite web|author=Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Jeremy Scahill|title=Welcome to The Intercept|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/10/welcome-intercept|publisher=The Intercept|date=February 10, 2014|access-date=December 7, 2015}}</ref>

==Awards==
In February 2016, ''The Intercept'' won a [[National Magazine Award]] for columns and commentary by the writer [[Barrett Brown]], and it was a finalist in the public interest category for a series by Sharon Lerner called the Teflon Toxin, which exposed how [[DuPont]] harmed the public and its workers with toxic chemicals.<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 National Magazine Awards|url=http://www.magazine.org/asme/2016-national-magazine-awards/|publisher=American Society of Magazine Editors|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref> In April 2016, ''The Intercept'' won the People's Voice award for best news website at the twentieth annual [[Webby Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Webby Awards 2016 Winners: Netflix, HBO, the Onion, Tyler Oakley, Michelle Obama Pick Up Awards |date=April 26, 2016 |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/awards/webby-awards-2016-winners-netflix-hbo-tyler-oakley-michelle-obama-onion-1201760860/ |publisher=Variety|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref> In May 2016, ''The Intercept'' won three awards at the New York Press Club Awards For Journalism.

At the 2017 Online News Awards, ''The Intercept'' won two awards: the first for a feature story about the FBI's efforts to infiltrate the [[Bundy family]], and the second, an investigative data journalism award for "Trial and Terror", a project documenting the people prosecuted in the U.S. for terrorism since 9/11.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mizgata|first1=Jennifer|title=2017 Online Journalism Awards winners include Le Temps, The Washington Post and STAT|url=https://awards.journalists.org/2017/10/08/2017-online-journalism-awards-winners-include-le-temps-washington-post-stat/|access-date=December 5, 2017|work=Journalists.org|date=October 10, 2017}}</ref> The same year, ''The Intercept'' won a Hillman Prize for Web Journalism for an investigative series by Jamie Kalven exposing criminality within the Chicago Police Department.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Foundation|first1=Hillman|title=2017 Hillman Prizes|url=http://www.hillmanfoundation.org/hillman-prizes/2017|access-date=December 5, 2017|work=Hillman Foundation|date=June 6, 2017}}</ref> The news organization also won a 2017 award for "Outstanding Feature Story" at the sixteenth annual Awards for Reporting on The Environment.<ref name="auto">{{cite news|last1=SEJ|title=Winners: SEJ 16th Annual Awards for Reporting on the Environment |url=http://www.sej.org/winners-sej-16th-annual-awards-reporting-environment|access-date=December 5, 2017|work=Society of Environmental Journalists|date=June 6, 2017}}</ref> Judges of the environmental award praised author Sharon Lerner for her piece "The Strange Case of Tennie White", which they described as a "finely written and disturbing investigation of contamination and injustice near a chemical plant in Mississippi".<ref name="auto"/>

==U.S. government reaction==
On August 15, 2014, U.S. [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|National Counterintelligence Executive]] (NCE) [[William Evanina]] confirmed that the [[FBI]] is moving forward with a probe into how classified documents were leaked to ''The Intercept'' for its article revealing details about a database of terrorism suspects, which linked some people to terrorism even if they had no known association with any terrorism group. "It's a criminal act that has us very concerned," said Evanina, a former FBI special agent with a counter-terrorism specialty who was appointed NCE by [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James R. Clapper]] in May 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Charles S.|title=Meet the Man Who's Gauging the Damage From Snowden|url=http://www.govexec.com/management/2014/08/meet-man-whos-gauging-damage-snowden/91595|work=Government Executive|date=August 15, 2014|access-date=August 18, 2014}}</ref>

In August 2014, it was reported that members of the U.S. military had been banned from reading ''The Intercept''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gilbert|first=David|date=August 21, 2014|title=US Military Banned From Reading Glenn Greenwald's New Website|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/us-military-banned-reading-glenn-greenwalds-new-website-1462046|newspaper=[[International Business Times UK]]|access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Fingas|first=Jon|date=August 20, 2014|title=US military bans staff from reading a site devoted to leaks|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/20/us-military-bans-intercept/|newspaper=[[Engadget]]|access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Benson|first=Thor|date=August 21, 2014|title=Military Is Banning Soldiers from Reading Documents Everyone Else Can See|url=https://mic.com/articles/96904/the-military-is-banning-soldiers-from-reading-documents-everyone-else-can-see|newspaper=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]|access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Democracy|first1=Now|title=U.S. Military Bans, Blocks The Intercept News Site|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2014/8/26/headlines/us_military_bans_blocks_the_intercept_news_site|access-date=August 26, 2017|work=Democracy Now|date=August 26, 2014}}</ref>

==Controversies==
[[Erik Wemple]], writing for ''The Washington Post'', noted the conspicuous refusal of ''The Intercept'' to use the term "[[targeted killing]]s" to refer to the U.S. drone program, instead referring to the drone strikes as "assassinations". Wemple included [[Glenn Greenwald]]'s explanation that [[assassination]] is "the accurate term rather than the [[euphemism|euphemistic]] term that the government wants us to use"; Greenwald further noted that "anyone who is murdered deliberately away from a battlefield for political purposes is being assassinated".<ref name=wemple>{{cite news |last1=Wemple |first1=Erik |date=February 10, 2014 |title=Glenn Greenwald and the U.S. 'assassination' program |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/02/10/glenn-greenwald-and-the-u-s-assassination-program |website=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=December 7, 2015}}</ref> [[TechCrunch]] referred to the story as clear evidence of "unabashed opposition to security [[War hawk#Variations of the term|hawks]]".<ref name=techcrunch>{{cite web |last1=Ferenstein |first1=Gregory |date=February 10, 2014 |title=eBay Founder's News Site, ''The Intercept'', Launches with NSA Revelations |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/10/ebay-founders-news-site-the-intercept-launches-with-nsa-revelations |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |access-date=December 7, 2015}}</ref>

[[Jewish Telegraph Agency]] wrote that ''The Intercept''{{'}}s founder "has relentlessly criticized Israel and its political leadership, and at times has invoked tropes of [[dual loyalty]] in attacking the pro-Israel community". The site also published a podcast titled "The case against [[AIPAC]]".<ref name=antiisraelsite>{{cite news |last1=Friedman |first1=Gabe |title=New York Times hires opinion editor from The Intercept, a news site that's harshly critical of Israel |url=https://www.jta.org/quick-reads/new-york-times-hires-opinion-editor-from-the-intercept-a-news-site-thats-harshly-critical-of-israel |access-date=25 June 2020 |work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=23 June 2020}}</ref>

===Juan M. Thompson scandal===
{{main|Juan M. Thompson}}

In February 2016, the site appended lengthy corrections to five stories by reporter Juan M. Thompson and retracted a sixth, about [[Charleston church shooting|Charleston church shooter]] [[Dylann Roof]], written over the previous year, focused on the [[African Americans|African-American]] community. Shortly afterward, a note from editor Betsy Reed indicated that Thompson had been fired recently after his editors discovered "a pattern of deception" in his reporting. According to Reed, he had "fabricated several quotes in his stories and created fake email accounts that he used to impersonate people, one of which was a [[Gmail]] account in my name".<ref name="Thompson editor's note">{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Betsy|title=A Note to Readers|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/02/02/a-note-to-readers/|newspaper=The Intercept|date=February 2, 2016|access-date=February 4, 2016}}</ref>

Reed apologized to readers and to those misquoted. She noted that some of Thompson's work, most of it using public sources, was verifiable. Editors alerted any downstream users of the affected stories, and promised to take similar action if further fabrication came to light.<ref name="Thompson editor's note" />

Thompson suggested that the greater problem was [[racism]] in the media field. He had made up [[pseudonym]]s for some of his sources, whom he described as "poor black people who didn't want their names in the public given the situations" and would not have spoken with a reporter otherwise. "[T]he journalism that covers the experiences of poor black folk and the journalism others, such as you and First Look, are used to differs drastically," he argued. He also said he had felt a need to "exaggerate my personal shit in order to prove my worth" at ''The Intercept'' given incidents of racial bias he said he had witnessed there. When ''[[Gawker]]'' published his email, Reed said those allegations had not been in the version he sent her.<ref name="Gawker Thompson story">{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=J.K.|title=Reporter Fabricated Quotes, Invented Sources at The Intercept|url=http://gawker.com/reporter-fabricated-quotes-invented-sources-at-the-int-1756672849|newspaper=[[Gawker]]|date=February 2, 2016|access-date=February 4, 2016}}</ref>

He was fired by ''The Intercept'' in early 2016 and, according to Reed, did not cooperate with the investigation into his actions.<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Julia Carrie|title=The Intercept admits reporter fabricated stories and quotes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/02/the-intercept-fires-reporter-juan-thompson|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 2, 2016|access-date=December 17, 2016}}</ref>

===Exposure and arrest of a confidential source===

In early June 2017, ''The Intercept'' published a National Security Agency document that asserts Russian intelligence successfully hacked an American voter registration and poll software company, and used information culled to [[Phishing|phish]] state election officials. The document was mailed from a source inside NSA, who did not reveal their identity to ''Intercept'' writers.<ref name="Intercept 6-17">{{cite journal |title=Top-Secret NSA Report Details Russian Hacking Effort Days Before 2016 Election |journal=The Intercept |date=June 5, 2017 |last=Cole |first=Matthew |last2=Esposito |first2=Richard |last3=Biddle |first3=Sam |last4=Grim |first4=Ryan |url=https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/ |access-date=August 12, 2017 }}</ref> One hour after publication, [[Reality Winner]], a 25-year old NSA contract employee, was arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and charged under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grynbaum|first1=Michael M.|last2=Koblin|first2=John|title=After Reality Winner's Arrest, Media Asks: Did 'Intercept' Expose a Source?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/business/media/intercept-reality-winner-russia-trump-leak.html|access-date=June 8, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 7, 2017|page=A19|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

The article bolstered public suspicion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. It also drew attention for being at odds with views held by editor Glenn Greenwald who had publicly ridiculed or dismissed allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,<ref name="Intercept 1-17">{{cite journal |title=WashPost Is Richly Rewarded for False News About Russia Threat While Public Is Deceived |journal=The Intercept |date=January 4, 2017 |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |author-link=Glenn Greenwald |url=https://theintercept.com/2017/01/04/washpost-is-richly-rewarded-for-false-news-about-russia-threat-while-public-is-deceived/ |access-date=August 12, 2017 }}</ref> calling them "radical conspiracy theories".<ref name="Democracy Now!">{{cite journal |title=Glenn Greenwald: Mainstream U.S. Media is Culpable for Disseminating Fake & Deceitful News on Russia |journal=Democracy Now! |date=January 5, 2017 |last=Goodman |first=Amy |author-link=Amy Goodman |last2=Greenwald |first2=Glenn |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2017/1/5/glenn_greenwald_mainstream_us_media_is |access-date=August 10, 2017 }}</ref> Greenwald said in a ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' interview that the Democratic party hyperbolized the evidence supporting collusion complaints about Trump, in order to shift the blame for Trump's election as president away from the Democratic Party.<ref name="Democracy Now!2">{{cite journal |title=Glenn Greenwald: Why Did Trump Win?

The document states that Russian intelligence attempted to crack the log-in information of the employees of a vendor providing voter registration software and databases for states to use with their election systems. It stated that the Russians were successful enough that they were able to email 122 election officials, by posing as employees of the vendor.

According to [[David Folkenflik]] of [[National Public Radio]], "[a]n ''Intercept'' reporter shared a photo of the papers with a source, a government contractor whom he trusted, seeking to validate it. The printout included a postmark of Augusta, Ga., and [[microdot]]s, a kind of computerized fingerprint. The contractor told his bosses, who informed the FBI."<ref>{{cite news |work=[[NPR]] |date=June 7, 2017 |first=David |last=Folkenflik |access-date=September 24, 2020 |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531859840/did-intercept-out-its-source|title=Did 'Intercept' Out Its Intelligence Source?}}</ref> NSA quickly identified the leaker of the documents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.erratasec.com/2017/06/how-intercept-outed-reality-winner.html |title=How The Intercept Outed Reality Winner|first=Robert|last=Graham|date=June 6, 2017|access-date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>

Verifying the legitimacy of leaked documents is common journalism practice, as is protecting third parties who may be harmed incidentally by the leak being published. However, professional media outlets who receive documents or recordings from confidential sources do not, as a practice, share the unfiltered primary evidence with a federal agency for review or verification, as it is known that metadata and unique identifiers may be revealed that were not obvious to the journalist, and the source exposed.<ref name="Nieman Reports">{{cite journal |title=When Is it Ethical to Publish Stolen Data? |journal=Nieman Reports |date=June 1, 2015 |last=Lewis |first=Helen |url=http://niemanreports.org/articles/when-is-it-ethical-to-publish-stolen-data/ |access-date=July 30, 2017 }}</ref><ref name="Source 17">{{cite web |url=https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-protect-your-sources-when-releasing-sensitive-/ |title=Protecting Your Sources When Releasing Sensitive Documents |last=Han |first=Ted |last2=Norton |first2=Quinn |work=Source (Website) |publisher=OpenNews/Community Partners |date=June 7, 2017 |access-date=August 12, 2017 }}</ref>

According to the FBI, the evidence chain led to the arrest of Winner, a young Air Force veteran who was working in Georgia for Pluribus International Corporation, an NSA contractor, when the document was mailed to ''The Intercept''.<ref name="FBI-rlwinner">{{cite press release |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-government-contractor-georgia-charged-removing-and-mailing-classified-materials-news |title=Federal Government Contractor in Georgia Charged With Removing and Mailing Classified Materials to a News Outlet |author=Federal Bureau of Investigation |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |date=June 5, 2017 |access-date=August 12, 2017 }}</ref> ''The Intercept'' has been criticized for unprofessional handling of the document, and indifference to the source's safety.<ref name="Mediaite">{{cite journal |title=Intercept Editors Face Mounting Criticism for Possibly Outing Leaker |journal=Nieman Reports |date=June 6, 2017 |last=McLaughlin |first=Aidan |url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/intercept-editors-face-mounting-criticism-for-reportedly-outing-leaker/ |access-date=August 12, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.niemanlab.org/2017/06/the-intercepts-russian-hacking-report-also-seems-to-be-a-good-example-of-how-not-to-handle-leaks/ |first=Laura Hazard |last=Owen |date=June 6, 2017 |title=The Intercept's Russian hacking report also seems to be a good example of how not to handle leaks|work=Nieman Lab|access-date=July 7, 2017}}</ref>

Following the arrest of Winner, ''The Intercept'' released a statement saying it had "no knowledge of the identity of the person who provided us with the document". Allegations from the FBI about Winner, it added, were "unproven assertions and speculation designed to serve the government's agenda and as such warrant skepticism".<ref>{{cite news|last1=The|first1=Intercept|title=Statement on Justice Department Allegations|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/06/06/statement-on-justice-department-allegations/|access-date=December 5, 2017|work=The Intertcept|date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>

NSA whistleblower [[John Kiriakou]] and [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] whistleblower Joseph Hickman have both accused the same reporter accused of revealing Winner's identity, Matthew Cole, of playing a role in their exposure, which, in Kiriakou's case, led to his imprisonment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peterbcollins.com/2017/06/30/in-depth-interview-whistleblowers-joe-hickman-and-john-kiriakou-on-abu-zubaydeh-torture-and-a-dangerous-reporter/|title=In-Depth Interview: Whistleblowers Joe Hickman and John Kiriakou on Abu Zubaydeh, Torture and a Dangerous Reporter|date=June 30, 2017|publisher=The Peter Collins Show|access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.4148070/ex-cia-whistleblower-blasts-reporters-for-not-protecting-alleged-nsa-leaker-reality-winner-1.4148075|title=Ex-CIA whistleblower blasts reporters for not protecting alleged NSA leaker Reality Winner |date=June 6, 2017|publisher=CBC Radio|access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref>

On July 11, 2017, ''The Intercept'' announced that its parent company, First Look Media, through its Press Freedom Defense Fund, would provide $50,000 in matching funds to Stand with Reality, a crowd-funding campaign to support Winner's legal defense, plus a separate grant to engage a second law firm to assist Winner's principal attorneys, Augusta-based Bell & Brigham. Additionally, wrote editor-in-chief Betsy Reed, "First Look's counsel Baruch Weiss of the firm [[Arnold & Porter|Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer]] may support the defense efforts while continuing to represent First Look's interests."<ref>{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Betsy|title=First Look to Support Defense of Reality Winner in Espionage Act Prosecution|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/07/11/first-look-to-support-defense-of-reality-winner-in-espionage-act-prosecution/|access-date=January 9, 2018|work=The Intertcept|date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>

On August 23, 2018, at a federal court in Georgia, Winner was sentenced to the agreed-upon five years and three months in prison for violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]].

===Resignation of Glenn Greenwald===

On October{{nbsp}}29, 2020, [[Glenn Greenwald]] resigned from ''The Intercept'', saying that he faced political censorship and contractual breaches from the editors, who he wrote had prevented him from reporting on [[Joe Biden]]'s conduct with regard to China and Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Baragona|first=Maxwell Tani, Justin|date=2020-10-29|title=Glenn Greenwald Resigns From The Intercept, Claims He Was Censored|language=en|work=The Daily Beast|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/glenn-greenwald-resigns-from-the-intercept-claims-he-was-censored|access-date=2020-10-29}}</ref> On his blog, he wrote that the magazine "is rapidly becoming just another media outlet with mandated ideological and partisan loyalties" and no longer provided editorial freedom.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Greenwald|title=My Resignation From The Intercept|url=https://greenwald.substack.com/p/my-resignation-from-the-intercept|access-date=2020-10-29|website=greenwald.substack.com}}</ref> ''The Intercept'' disputed Greenwald's accusations, writing that Greenwald "believes that anyone who disagrees with him is corrupt, and anyone who presumes to edit his words is a censor" and telling ''The Washington Post'', "it is absolutely not true that Glenn Greenwald was asked to remove all sections critical of Joe Biden from his article.
